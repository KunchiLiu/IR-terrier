	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine difference block quality `` dural-puncture epidural '' ( DPE ) standard epidural ( EPL ) techniques labor analgesia morbidly obese patient . The investigator hypothesize compare standard EPL , DPE technique improve block quality . Study participant randomize computer-generated sequence EPL DPE arm , stratify class obesity ( BMI &lt; 50 kg/m2 ≥ 50 kg/m2 ) parity ( nulliparous versus multiparous ) . All patient receive neuraxial technique sit position L3/4 L4/5 use loss resistance saline . In DPE group , 25-g Whitacre needle use puncture dura . In group , epidural catheter thread 5 cm epidural space initiation dose 15 ml ropivacaine 0.1 % fentanyl ( 2 mcg/ml ) 6 minute per standard practice . After initial load dose epidural pump start , blind investigator enter patient 's room start data collection ( time 0 ) . Data collect first 30 minute epidural placement 3,6,9,12,15,18 21 , 30 minute detect time achieve target pain ≤ 1/10 , assess standardize time ( ever 2 hour ) delivery . Breakthrough pain manage standardize protocol . Other data collect include : catheter adjustment replacement , physician top-up , asymmetrical block , pain score , motor block , sensory level ice , hypotension , total anesthetic dose require , PCEA use . The primary outcome study block quality define composite five component : ( 1 ) asymmetric block 30 minute initiation , ( 2 ) top-up intervention , ( 3 ) catheter adjustment ( 4 ) fail catheter require replacement , ( 5 ) fail epidural require general anesthesia replacement neuraxial anesthesia emergency cesarean section . Secondary outcome include time numeric pain rating scale ≤1 , maternal adverse event ( hypotension , fetal bradycardia , PDPH ) , motor block , duration second stage labor , total labor epidural time , total anesthetic dose require , PCEA use , mode delivery . There increased risk/safety issue place dural puncture technique epidural labor analgesia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose study : The primary purpose study determine difference block quality DPE standard EPL techniques labor analgesia morbidly obese patient . Establishing superiority technique multifaceted complex ; therefore , design study define set measureable outcome assess property , address subsequent section . The investigator hypothesize compare standard EPL , DPE technique significantly improve block quality population . The secondary purpose study find optimal maintenance regimen epidural analgesia morbidly obese population . For maintenance epidural analgesia , common practice use either continuous epidural infusion program intermittent bolus use solution ropivicaine 0.1 % fentanyl ( 2 mcg/mL ) . To date , randomize prospective study investigate maintenance regimen morbidly obese parturient population . What show super morbidly obese patient increase intra-abdominal intracranial pressure increase pressure epidural space . Because elevated pressure , epidural spread increase , result high sensory block necessary adequate labor analgesia.15 An important consequence morbidly obese parturient may experience additional undesirable side effect labor epidural : increased respiratory function , increase incidence hypotension , increase motor block . Design procedure : The investigator propose prospective , double-blinded , randomized trial . According patient population incidence morbid obesity , enrollment would likely occur 2 3-year period . The investigator delivery rate 3500 per year . Previous data institution show least 11 % patient morbidly obese . The investigator therefore expect 800-900 morbidly obese woman deliver institution per year . The investigator anticipate complete enrollment study 1-2 year . Epidural technique : Once patient request labor epidural , usual standard care epidural placement initiate . The patient least one 18g intravenous catheter receive 500-1000 milliliter ( mL ) fluid administration . Vitals monitor labor nurse , include continuous pulse oximetry , non-invasive blood-pressure monitoring , external tocodynamometry . Anesthesia time-out perform anesthesia provider participation nurse patient . All patient receive neuraxial technique sit position L3/4 L4/5 use loss resistance saline . In DPE group , 25-g Whitacre needle use puncture dura . In group , epidural catheter thread 5 cm epidural space initiation dose 15 ml ropivacaine 0.1 % fentanyl ( 2 mcg/ml ) 6 minute per standard practice . Labor analgesia maintain programmed intermittent bolus 6 ml solution every 45 minute start 30 minute initial dose . Patients patient-controlled epidural analgesia ( PCEA ) available 8 ml dose per demand , every 10 minute , maximum dose 45 ml every hour . Assignment Study Cohorts : Study participant randomize computer-generated sequence EPL DPE arm , stratify class obesity ( BMI &lt; 50 kg/m2 ≥ 50 kg/m2 ) parity ( nulliparous versus multiparous ) . Patients assign one four study arm computer-generated , randomized sequence order balance baseline characteristic across arm . This double-blinded study . After consent enrol participant request labor epidural , study member give anesthesia provider seal envelope study assignment . The envelope contain instruction placement epidural wither standard EPL DPE technique specify maintenance regimen either Programmed Intermittent Epidural Bolus ( PIEB ) Continuous Epidural Infusion ( CEI ) . Protocol Breakthrough Pain - If patient uneven unilateral level , provider withdrawal catheter 1cm skin bolus 5ml epidural mix . As fetal heart rate allow maternal repositioning , patient lay lateral position unblocked side dependent position . ( 3 catheter adjustment ) - If patient bilateral level T10 ice , patient administer 5 ml epidural pump , 3 time 15 minute . - If patient pain despite T10 level , provider administer Fentanyl 100 mcg via epidural . - If analgesia continue despite intervention 3 time within 30-60 minute , attend anesthesiologist determine epidural catheter need replacement .</detailed_description>
