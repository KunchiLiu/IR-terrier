	<brief_summary>Ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) , type pneumonia develop 48 hour endotracheal intubation , common intensive care unit ( ICUs ) . It estimate responsible 27 % 47 % ICU-acquired infection . The pathogenesis VAP complex typically involve colonization aerodigestive tract pathogenic bacteria , formation biofilms , microaspiration contaminate secretion . Preventing carriage potentially pathogenic micro-organism aerodigestive tract infection control strategy use reduce occurrence VAP . One novel intervention administration prophylactic probiotic restore non-pathogenic flora compete pathogen , modulate local systemic immunity , decrease intestinal permeability thus beneficial prevent nosocomial infection critically ill patient . The role probiotic prevent VAP mechanically ventilate patient inconclusive . Some evidence indicate probiotic may reduce incidence VAP inhibit pathogen adhesion , improve gut mucosal barrier function , reduce bacterial translocation up-regulating immune system . Furthermore , guideline remain inconclusive regard role commensal oropharyngeal flora ( COF ) causative agent VAP , mainly due scarcity study research field . However , evidence COF may cause pulmonary infection , mostly immunocompromised patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The oropharyngeal swab collect day 1 , 3 7 ICU admission upon occurrence VAP infection . Nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) use protect catheter collect day 3 ICU admission upon occurrence VAP . Whole blood sample stool sample collect day 1 ICU admission upon occurrence VAP infection microbiome analysis . As soon first sample oropharyngeal swab collect , patient allocate `` treatment '' group . Each patient receive two capsule per day 15 consecutive day post admission . The content one capsule suspend 100ml tap water administer nasogastric tube ) , content capsule suspend sterile , water-based surgical lubricant administer slurry oropharynx . The administration perform study nurse responsible ascertain whole prepared volume give . The study protocol-mandated baseline data include demographic information , medical history , APACHE II , SAPS II , NISS SOFA score , Operative POSSUM score ( case undergo surgical treatment ) . Additional information collect daily basis include patient 's clinical course special emphasis clinical sign VAP infection , type chemoprophylaxis , endotracheal tracheostomy tube cuff pressure , type nutrition bowel movement . Furthermore , duration intubation , tracheostomy day ICU admission , duration mechanical ventilation , lengths stay ICU hospital , adverse event ( relate non-related probiotic administration ) mortality . Data recording extend 30 day hospital admission ( patient recover , treat ICU / department death ) . Central venous line infection consider positive bacteremia common skin commensal positive catheter tip culture exit site culture organism . An ICU-acquired urinary tract infection deem present least 103 colony-forming unit ( cfu ) /mL 1 2 micro-organisms identify urine culture patient develop positive urine culture first identify 48 h later ICU admission . A superficial incisional infection ( SSI ) must meet following criterion : Infection occur within 30 day operative procedure involve skin subcutaneous tissue incision patient least 1 follow : - purulent drainage superficial incision - organisms isolate aseptically obtained culture fluid tissue superficial incision - least 1 follow sign symptoms infection : pain tenderness , localize swelling , redness , heat , superficial incision deliberately open surgeon culture positive culture . A culture-negative finding meet criterion . - diagnosis superficial incisional SSI surgeon attend physician . Intraabdominal trauma infection define follow : - Temperature &gt; 38°C &lt; 36°C - White blood cell count &gt; 12 000/mm3 &lt; 4000/mm3 &gt; 10 % immature band - Abdominal tenderness clinical examination - CT scan compatible positive finding acute intraabdominal infection An antibiotics-related infection document detection toxin produce C. difficile bacteria stool sample . Bacteremia define presence recognize Gram ( + ) Gram ( - ) pathogen Candida spp culture one blood culture organism culture blood relate infection another site Sepsis define life-threatening organ dysfunction cause dysregulated host response infection . Organ dysfunction identify acute change total SOFA score ≥2 point consequent infection . Patients septic shock identify clinical construct sepsis persist hypotension require vasopressor maintain MAP ≥65 mm Hg serum lactate level &gt; 2 mmol/L ( 18mg/dL ) despite adequate volume resuscitation .</detailed_description>
