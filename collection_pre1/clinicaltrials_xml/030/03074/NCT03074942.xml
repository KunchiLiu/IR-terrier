	<brief_summary>Approximately , 5 % patient asthma suffer difficult-to-control severe variant disease . Despite treat inhaled corticosteroid ( ICs ) , long-acting β2-agonists ( LABA ) , oral corticosteroid omalizumab , one component control concept ( symptom , exacerbation , bronchial obstruction ) remain resolved . Omalizumab proven safely reduce asthma exacerbation decease symptom quality life severe allergic asthmatic . However , approximately 25 % treated patient fail respond monoclonal antibody . The rest show different degree response , although rate asthmatic achieve control disease unknown clinical trial omalizumab carried assess impact drug exacerbation , symptom even pulmonary function , effect control evaluate . Therefore , need find new therapeutic option severe asthmatic remain uncontrolled despite receive recommended therapy ( include omalizumab ) . Reslizumab humanize anti-interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) recently find reduce exacerbation improve pulmonary function symptom patient severe asthma high peripheral eosinophil count . It would important demonstrate Reslizumab able improve clinical condition severe asthma patient therapeutic option .</brief_summary>
