	<brief_title>Ventral Hernia Study Using OviTex Reinforced Bioscaffold</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study intend evaluate post-operative complication re-herniations follow use OviTex® Permanent 1S reinforce bioscaffold subject ventral hernia . The study design mirror surgical standard care ventral hernia intervention , exception ask subject return evaluation long time point post-surgery typical standard care . A baseline visit perform patient identify provide inform consent participate study . During visit , review medical history , physical exam assessment hernia site perform . The potential subject also ask complete two quality life survey ; one disease specific one standard method health assessment . On day surgery , ventral hernia repair use OviTex® 1S reinforce bioscaffold . Perioperative data collect surgeon provide assessment product 's handling quality . During course hospital stay , subject assess incidence early post-operative surgical site wound event complication , necessary medical intervention and/or re-operations . On day discharge , surgical site occurrence wound related event note hernia repair site occurrence post-operative complication assess . The Day 30 Day 90 visit visit window +/- 2 week . At visit , incidence late surgical site occurrence wound related event note hernia repair site assess . If hernia recurrence suspect , confirm via diagnostic image CT scan . The occurrence late post-operative complication also assess . The subject ask complete disease specific questionnaire health assessment questionnaire do Baseline visit , however subject also ask complete pain assessment . Both surgeon subject provide assessment his/her satisfaction hernia repair . The activity Months 12 24 mirror Days 30 90 , however visit window extend +/- 4 week .</detailed_description>
