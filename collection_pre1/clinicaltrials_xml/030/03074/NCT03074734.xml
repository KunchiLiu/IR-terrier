	<brief_title>Health Effects Secondhand Smoke Exposure Outdoor Smoking Areas Patients With COPD Asthma ( TackSHSWP5 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study part TackSHS project conduct three select European country , coordinate Prof Luke Clancy , Director General TobaccoFree Research Institute ( Dublin , Ireland ) . Background : Respiratory disease cause important worldwide health burden . It estimate 2020 , 68 million death worldwide , 11.9 million cause lung disease , 4.7 COPD , 2.5 pneumonia , 2.4 TB 2.3 million lung cancer . Over past two decade , scientific evidence accumulate link secondhand tobacco smoke ( SHS ) exposure adverse health outcome , include respiratory outcome child adult , acute cardiovascular effect , lung cancer . However , scarce knowledge health effect SHS respiratory disease patient . TackSHS new research project fund European Commission ( EC ) within Horizon 2020 programme ( Grant Agreement : 681040 ) . Within TackSHS Project , WorkPackage 5 aim broaden knowledge improve understanding ( immediate ) effect SHS respiratory health . The study objective : - measure respiratory health effect expose SHS : patient asthma COPD - investigate exposure level Second Hand Smoke ( SHS ) smoke area provide bar , casino , bingo hall , etc . Study Design Population : The study population consist 30 Asthmatic 30 COPD subject recruit European Lung Foundation ( ELF ) three EU country ( 20 subject country ) , lead total sample 60 participant . Study location : Hungary , Ireland , Spain Study description To achieve mention objective describe study design . Each patient visit centre 2 occasion . During first visit study explain participant , write ( information sheet ) oral form , recruitment questionnaire fill ascertain personal smoking status , source exposure , average weekly exposure hospitality premise , experience respiratory symptom ; addition , CO read spirometry perform experienced nurse . During session , patient also train fit use necessary device : Respeck /Leosound/ AirSpeck , /sidePak Peak Flow monitor . Diary card demonstrate explained patient . This first visit schedule least 2 day prior exposure . After first visit , participant ask fill daily diary card record morning evening peak flow result , medication consume , occur symptom ( cough , wheeze ) , doctor hospital visit , exposure SHS number cigarette smoke ( ) . The participant also ask note exposure outside SHS occur well peak flow result pre post exposure . All patient train use monitoring equipment , measure exposure pollutant include SHS well measure effect health . Air pollution measure use cutting-edge , small portable instrument continuously rapidly record change air . Breathing measured peak flow meter exhale breath gas ( e.g . Carbon Monoxide ) . Every participant give peak flow meter ask blow pre-designated time . A small sensor attach participant 's chest ( RESpeck/leosound ) measure record respiratory rate wheeze , . This cause undue discomfort inconvenience participant . Intervention ( Exposure ) At least one out outdoor smoke area happen . The duration time spend outdoor smoke area minimum 15 minute preferable time 30-60 minute . Diary card entry do least 2 day prior exposure 2 day post exposure , second visit research centre schedule . At second ( post exposure ) visit data record device download checked diary card anomaly address clarified patient . In addition , CO read spirometry repeat . National Partners train use device measure exposure use AirSpeck/SidePak respiratory rate use RESpeck/Leosound . Data transmit secure server analysis Data collection , analysis report writing : carry TFRI collaboration Project Partners consultation Prof Rod Jones Prof DK Arvind . Primary endpoint : - To monitor personal exposure SHS area exempt legislation pub , bar casinos etc . use novel monitoring technology - To simultaneously monitor respiratory effect indicate change respiratory rate flow activity level - To monitor peak flow rate record patient use diary card peak flow meter . Secondary endpoint : - Medication usage - Symptoms - Primary care and/or hospital visit - CO monitoring pre post study - Spirometry result pre post exposure Ethical approval seek DIT Ethics Committee prior begin project . All documentation relate project provide ethical review . There perceived Ethical issue patient fully inform intervention monitoring . It consider request subject go outside smoke area might problem subject already frequent visitor area recruit . Once eligibility determine patient give appointment research center receive information leaflet . Once read concern participant address explain , ask provide write consent prior study enrolment . Consent obtain participant . Consent on-going participant revoke consent stage project . The safety research participant consider time , see insured medical practice . All personnel deal patient fully train insure . All data store secure server de-identified . Data enter give participant unique identifier code ; neither name , address , date birth record order protect confidentiality participant . Analysis carry blinded dataset use SPSS . All digitally record data download device secure server . A Post Doc Research assistant work TFRI advice partner examine study data . Any anomaly find address resolve source data .</detailed_description>
