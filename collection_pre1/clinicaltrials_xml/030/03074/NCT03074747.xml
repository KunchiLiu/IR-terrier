	<brief_summary>Background : Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) refers apnea hypopnea cause upper airway obstruction sleep . Patients associated sleep disorder , frequent desaturation , hypertension , coronary heart disease , cerebrovascular disease diabetes . OSA prevalence increase China recent year . It estimate nearly 80 % men 93 % woman diagnose moderate severe OSA . Anesthesiologists surgeon pay attention high risk patient . The gold standard OSA diagnosis apnea hypopnea index ( AHI ) obtain polysomnography ( PSG ) . But difficult carry PSG regularly primary health care institution China high cost long wait list . So many OSA questionnaire develop Europe North America , obesity important risk factor OSA . But China people different anatomical characteristic , diagnosis sensitivity specificity method report China . Methods Design : Participants study recruit Beijing Tongren Hospital schedule elective surgery general anesthesia . A total 1200 adult male patient enrol . It include 3 kind person . 1 . To accept PSG monitor sleep center . 2 . To receive OSA correction surgery ( UPPP ) . 3 . To receive ophthalmological surgery general anesthesia . Detailed inquiry record medical history . Upper airway assessment record . Preoperative snoring questionnaire integrate accord four questionnaire . All patient complete PSG monitor . For patient undergoing surgical treatment , postoperative continuous pulse oximetry record 24 hour . All postoperative adverse event record . The primary endpoint : All patient complete four snoring questionnaire ( ASA , Berlin , STOP STOP-BANG ) PSG test . The secondary endpoint : PSG monitor complete operation . Medical history , upper airway assessment , postoperative 24 hour continuous pulse oximetry monitor perioperative adverse event record . The purpose compare specificity sensitivity four questionnaire figure OSA . To find suspected OSA patient operation one easy-to-use assessment questionnaire direct OSA clinical practice .</brief_summary>
