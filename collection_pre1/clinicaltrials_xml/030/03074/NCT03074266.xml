	<brief_title>Clinical Performance Investigational Hemochron® MCS 7000 Whole Blood Microcoagulation System ( MCS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study perform clinical setting train professional operator . Group 1 : Whole Blood Coagulation Test 1 , Hemochron® MCS 7000 Whole Blood Microcoagulation System Group 2 : Whole Blood Coagulation Test 2 , Hemochron® Signature Elite® 7000 Whole Blood Microcoagulation System Ex-vivo whole blood sample destine discard medically directed test complete use heparinized patient undergo standard care interventional procedure different clinical setting . These include , limited , cardiovascular operating room ( CVOR ) , vascular surgery operating room , cardiac catheterization lab , surgical intensive care unit ( SICU ) , neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) , electrophysiology ( EP ) lab , hemodialysis unit extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) application . A distribution ACT value necessary evaluate clinical accuracy . The target number subject site 30 minimum enrollment 25 per site . Samples examine baseline ( pre-heparin administration ) end procedure . Heparinized sample may obtain ACT test multiple time heparin administer throughout duration procedure . The frequency time interval ACT test determined Standard Care . No additional blood volume extra blood draw occur result study . Normal healthy individual also enrol insure collection data cover entire detection range instrument . One whole blood sample test per subject ( target 20 subject select clinical site ) . The work flow test process consistent across site . Expected duration study dependent upon site logistics generally expect last four six week . ACT result generate MCS 7000 instrument study use solely research purpose use anticoagulation management study subject . No patient follow require . The study include two MCS 7000 instrument , train operator , two Signature Elite instrument procedure . Guidance obtain Point-of-Care Monitoring Anticoagulation Therapy ; Approved Guideline ( CLSI POCT14-A ) , CLSI EP09-A3 : `` Method Procedure Comparison Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples ; Approved guideline Third Edition '' peer review literature . All study data collect Case Report Forms analysis perform Accriva .</detailed_description>

Patients require heparin anticoagulant therapy approve indication manage monitor ACT test . Normal Group Males females 18 year old . The following criterion define population subject accept study : The subject develop significant , unexpected , concurrent illness adverse event first whole blood sample drawn . The subject hematocrit le 20 % great 55 % since sample recommend test due optical density outside Hemochron instrument level detection . Additional Exclusion Criteria Normal Group Subjects receive form anticoagulation drug Aspirin Clopidogrel .</criteria>
