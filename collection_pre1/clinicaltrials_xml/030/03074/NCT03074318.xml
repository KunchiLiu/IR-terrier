	<brief_summary>This phase I/II study side effect avelumab trabectedin well work treat patient leiomyosarcoma liposarcoma spread place body remove surgery . Monoclonal antibody , avelumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , trabectedin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving avelumab trabectedin may work well treat patient liposarcoma leiomyosarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Avelumab Trabectedin Treating Patients With Liposarcoma Leiomyosarcoma That Metastatic Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability combination trabectedin avelumab patient advance leiomyosarcoma liposarcoma ( L-type sarcoma ) . II . To assess objective response rate advance L-type sarcoma patient receive combination avelumab trabectedin . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore clinical activity avelumab trabectedin respect time response . II . To explore clinical activity avelumab trabectedin respect duration response . III . To explore clinical activity avelumab trabectedin respect progression-free survival ( PFS ) 12 week . IV . To explore clinical activity avelumab trabectedin respect clinical benefit rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] + stable disease [ SD ] ) 12 week . V. To explore clinical activity avelumab trabectedin respect overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive avelumab intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive trabectedin IV 24 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week may repeat every 5 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week 2 year .</detailed_description>
