	<brief_summary>Poor inadequate bowel preparation one common reason repeat failed colonoscopy . Preparation method show effective include use either bowel-cleansing device oral laxative . Despite acceptable effectiveness safety bowel-cleansing method , study perform evaluate method effective . The main aim perform observational study follow propensity score model evaluate compare quality bowel preparation use Aquanet bowel-cleansing device versus use oral Sodium picosulfate solution . The study involve 314 patient require colonoscopy , 14 90 year age three bowel movement per week past one month . Outcomes interest quality bowel preparation evaluate Boston Bowel Preparation ( BBP ) scale . The investigator hypothesize bowel preparation Aquanet bowel-cleansing device colonoscopy provide good outcome patient conventional method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aquanet Bowel Cleansing Device Versus Oral Sodium Picosulfate Pre-endoscopy Bowel Preparation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study compare quality pre-endoscopic bowel preparation use bowel-cleansing device oral Sodium picosulfate solution . The study describe accordance STROBE ( Strengthening Reporting Observational study Epidemiology ) guideline . Ethical aspect : The study undergo full review local Institutional Review Board , potential participant provide informed consent . Study protocol initiate consent sign . Settings : Data collect June 2014 February 2015 Portuguese Charitable Hospital , locate Sao Jose Rio Preto/SP , Brazil . The Kaiser clinic , private institution , pay Aquanet device . The Aquanet device design tested Prime Pacific Health Innovations Corporation ( http : //www.primepacifichealth.com/aquanet-family-of-colon-hydrotherapy-devices/ ) , approve various regulatory authority market approval license include FDA , Health Canada , European Union ( &lt; http : //www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm ? ID=K000031 &gt; , last access October 2016 ) . The Aquanet device market since 2001 . The procedure last 40-60 min , use filter , ultraviolet treated water . Water pressure derive gravity pump upper safe limit two psi ( per square inch ) pressure inside colon . The device cleanse large bowel series fill empty cycle hydrate colon , stimulate peristalsis evacuate bowel content . The process keep body hydrate without lose electrolyte . No adverse event report Aquanet device also complaints receive safety . It may cause mild abdominal discomfort water infusion patient . Participants : Inclusion criterion involve patient require colonoscopy , 14 90 year age , three bowel movement per week past one month . Patients exclude follow condition : Pregnancy ( confirmed pregnancy test ) , acute abdomen syndrome , prior colorectal surgery , hemorrhoid endoscopic procedure , know bowel disease ( colon cancer history , toxic megacolon , toxic colitis , idiopathic pseudo obstruction , hypo-motility syndrome ) , gastrointestinal disorder ( active ulcer , output obstruction , retention , gastroparesis , ileus ) , previous upper gastrointestinal surgery ( gastrectomy , gastric band , gastric bypass ) , uncontrolled angina and/or myocardial infarction ( MI ) within last three month , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) uncontrolled hypertension , renal impairment ( serum , creatinine potassium must within normal limit ) know hypersensitivity active ingredient . A total 314 patient part analysis . Outcome variable : Major outcome interest quality bowel preparation measure Boston Bowel Preparation ( BBP ) scale . Bowel preparation evaluate three segment : The right segment ( cecum ascend colon ) , transverse segment ( transverse colon include liver splenic angle ) , leave segment ( descend sigmoid colon rectum ) . Each segment evaluate scale 0-3 , final score individual sum score three segment . Using score , 0 minimum score correspond unprepared colon 9 maximum score correspond excellent preparation without residual trace . Predicting variable : Main predictor method bowel preparation . The bowel preparation do use either Sodium picosulfate bowel-cleansing device . On eve examination , participant Sodium picosulfate give four tablet Dulcolax tea water morning , liquid diet ( juice , tea water ) lunch , two capsule 25mg Dramamine Capsgel afternoon , Sodium picosulfate dissolve 150mL cold water thirty minute , follow drink least five 250-ml cup water light liquid midnight , absolute fasting time colonoscopy perform . For bowel preparation bowel cleanse device , intestinal lavage perform device , make use water , pressure , gravity enhance bowel cleansing . The water use procedure previously triple-filtered passage carbon , micro-pellets ultraviolet light . The preparation carry trained nurse . All endoscopic procedure perform endoscopist blind method preparation .</detailed_description>
