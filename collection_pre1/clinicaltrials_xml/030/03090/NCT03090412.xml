	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy With HPPH Compared Standard Care Surgery Treating Patients With Oral Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test non-inferiority photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) standard care surgery compare rate tumor response PDT observe surgery , 24 month post treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine quality life ( QoL ) 6 , 12 , 18 24 month post PDT surgery . II . To assess toxicity use Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE Version 4.0 ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Immune marker ( T cell ) . II . To investigate correlation diffuse reflectance optical spectroscopy tumor response PDT . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo standard care surgery day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive HPPH intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 0 undergo PDT day 1 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-4 month year 1 every 3-6 month year 2 .</detailed_description>
