	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) major health problem effect nearly 170 million people worldwide [ 1 , 2 ] . According report , 64-103 million people suffer chronic HCV infection [ 3 ] chronic infection result liver scar , hepatocellular carcinoma end-stage liver disease forty thousand ( 40,000 ) patient every year [ 4 , 5 ] . According WHO , liver disease initiate chronic hepatitis C infection responsible 35 thousand death 3 4 million people infect every year [ 3 , 6 ] . Hepatitis C Virus classify seven genotype several subtypes , associate distinct form geographic dispersal [ 7 , 8 ] . The success HCV treatment affect many viral , treatment host factor . Pegulated Interferon α2 plus ribavirin treatment choice patient chronic hepatitis C infection . Sustained virological response ( SVR ) rate treatment HCV-2 &amp; 3 report 58-84 % previously untreated patient [ 9 ] . SVR affect liver cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma , ethnicity , age , gender obesity . [ 10 , 11 ] It clarify study interleukin-28B important role treatment success HCV infection IL-28B CC genotype associate 2 fold higher sustain virological response ( SVR ) compare CT TT genotype [ 12-14 ] . The aim present study find frequency different IL28B ( rs12979860 ) genotypes patient chronic hepatitis C ( genotype type 2 3 ) infection treat Pegulated Interferon α2 plus ribavirin evaluate role IL-28B genotype achieve Sustained Virological Response ( SVR ) . METHODS : This non-randomized observational study conduct Sheikh Zayed Medical College/Hospital Rahim Yaar Khan . A total ninety eight ( 98 ) patient diagnosis chronic hepatitis C genotype 2 3 involve study . The duration study January 2015 January 2016 . People live Rahim Yaar Khan City belong different ethinic background city locate junction three province Pakistan ( total province four ) , people reside represent whole Pakistani population live different province . Institutional ethical approval take start research work . A write informed consent take every patient include him/her study . The diagnosis chronic hepatitis C make liver enzyme level , HCV-RNA positivity anti-HCV antibody test . Patients chronic liver disorder , positive hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection exclude study . Treatment Protocol Detection IL28B Polymorphism : In patient Pegulated Interferon α2 ( pegIFN ) plus Ribavirin give standard dos . PegINF give dose 180 μg/week ribavirin 1200 mg/day every patient period 24 week HCV genotype 2 &amp; 3 . PCR analysis do every patient start treatment , 24 week treatment ( see end treatment response ) 48 week ( evaluate SVR relapse rate ) treatment . Analysis IL28B ( rs12979860 ) polymorphism ( CC , CT TT ) perform PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) assay protocol . Pyrosequencing method use determine HCV genotype . Data analysis do use SPSS V17 software . Mean standard deviation use presentation quantitative variable . Frequency percentage use present qualitative data . Chi-square test/Fisher Exact test use compare qualitative data . P-value &lt; 0.05 take significant .</detailed_description>
