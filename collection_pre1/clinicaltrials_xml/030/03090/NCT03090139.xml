	<detailed_description>Participants historical diagnosis CD UC na√Øve anti-TNF therapy observe retrospective study . The study look identify local barrier prescribe anti-TNF therapy , treatment pattern indicator sub-optimal response anti-TNF therapy UC CD participant real-world clinical practice EM country , along associate incidence sub-optimal response impact health care resource utilization ( HCRU ) . The enroll approximately 2000 participant . The study consist two period , eligibility period follow data abstraction period . During eligibility period participant initiate first anti-TNF therapy 01 March 2010 01 March 2015 recruit observe . Participants follow period minimum 2 year ( death ) maximum 5 year date first treatment anti-TNF therapy CD UC ( Index date ) .
