	<brief_summary>People type 1 diabetes often find exercise difficult manage , high risk low blood glucose level . This occur quickly exercise start present many risk subject , severe symptom , confusion , passing , seizure , even coma death severe case . Preventing low blood glucose level exercise important physical exercise key component manage diabetes . It often hard correctly adjust insulin infusion rate dose exercise relationship exercise change glucose level type 1 diabetes still fully understood . Therefore , investigator propose study understanding area . This study design help separate effect insulin muscle work ( non-insulin effect ) change blood glucose level aerobic exercise . The main hypothesis non-insulin effect occur quickly exercise account rapid change blood glucose level aerobic exercise begin . These effect separate slow change insulin sensitivity occur exercise , account reduce insulin demand even exercise stop . The investigator investigate effect moderate intense aerobic exercise different level insulin body help separate insulin non-insulin effect . The investigator wish recruit 26 subject take part study . Subjects randomly divide two group , 13 group . Group 1 undergo moderate aerobic exercise , group 2 undergo intense aerobic exercise . Each subject repeat exercise study three time three separate day least 2 week apart , insulin infuse low , medium , high rate . Subjects IV line place arm , one draw blood relatively frequently study , another infusion insulin , glucose , special glucose tracer ( non-radioactive ) . Each study last 9 hour . Information study use help develop mathematical model glucose change exercise type 1 diabetes . Such model type 1 diabetes exercise useful adjusting insulin dose patient use multiple daily injection insulin , help guide automate insulin delivery system , artificial pancreas .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus afflicts close 10 % population 5 % diabetes type 1 , define absolute deficiency insulin . The need manage diabetes critical , give economic burden disease , $ 175 billion dollar direct health care cost , almost another $ 70 billion indirect cost disability work loss . The personal impact equally important people disease , diabetes mellitus lead cause blindness , need kidney dialysis , non-traumatic amputation United States . Type 2 diabetes associate reduced insulin sensitivity metabolic syndrome , dietary modification exercise important component management underlying insulin resistance . However , lifestyle strategy also important type 1 diabetes many reason : 1 ) type 1 diabetes subject live adulthood , insulin resistance obesity become factor glycemic control , 2 ) latent autoimmune diabetes adulthood ( LADA ) represent `` mixed '' form autoimmune diabetes type 2 diabetes characteristic insulin resistance exist , 3 ) dietary modification exercise remain effective mean management acute hyperglycemia , long term , HbA1c , potentially reduce risk microvascular complication . Therefore , need exercise still evident subject type 1 diabetes maintain good glycemic control prevent complication develop . However , exercise challenge people T1D manage . Exercise cause increase insulin sensitivity along rapid uptake glucose muscle tissue within body , lead sharp decline glucose level hypoglycemia show group well . Without adjustment insulin exercise , hypoglycemia common person type 1 diabetes . In study 48 individual T1D , adjustment insulin , exercise 60 min moderate intensity , glucose level drop average 40 % , 52 % subject fall 70 mg/dL . Despite clear need insulin adjustment exercise , uniform recommendation dose insulin around time exercise . In 2006 , DirecNet Study Group publish study impact suspend basal insulin start exercise 40 child type 1 diabetes insulin pump therapy . This intervention significantly reduce hypoglycemia ( 43 % 16 % ) , much commonly result hyperglycemia ( increased 4 % 23 % ) . Schiavon Cobelli et al address issue best adjust insulin exercise use silico simulation . Adjusting insulin dose silico environment decrease hypoglycemia 88 % 16 % patient universal adjustment apply , 4 % individual adjustment apply . The study describe within protocol design disambiguate impact exercise insulin non-insulin mediated effect glycemic control . To achieve , investigator perform series stable glucose tracer study subject fast 8 hour undergo aerobic exercise moderate intense level 45 minute insulin rate clamp low ( subject 's basal rate ) , medium ( basal x 1.5 ) , high ( basal x 3 ) insulin infusion rate . Subject 's basal rate obtain injected basal insulin amount , NPH/glargine/detemir , basal rate use insulin pump adjust HbA1c , describe OHSU AP system . Di-deuterated glucose ( 6,6-2H2-glucose ) radioactive metabolize via usual pathway human body stable tracer . Each subject per arm undergo 3 10-hour study blood glucose , insulin , glucagon level capture throughout study , catecholamine fatty acid level capture exercise period , outline . Glucose tracer level measure OHSU Bioanalytical Shared Resource/PK core lab , calculation rate appearance ( Ra ) rate disappearance ( Rd ) glucose performed colleague McGill University use non-steady state model glucose dynamic . The data obtain study inform update model glucose regulation type 1 diabetes , provide exercise input model , utilized model predictive control ( MPC ) system manage type 1 diabetes . Such system use deliver insulin and/or glucagon manage glycemic change outside exercise .</detailed_description>
