	<brief_summary>The purpose investigation evaluate maternal fetal outcome follow fetoscopic repair fetal spina bifida Johns Hopkins Hospital . The hypothesis study fetoscopic spina bifida repair feasible effectiveness open repair fetal spina bifida , benefit significantly low maternal fetal complication rate . The fetal benefit procedure prenatal repair spina bifida . The maternal benefit fetoscopic spina bifida repair avoidance large uterine incision . This type incision increase risk uterine rupture require future delivery cesarean section . The use minimally invasive fetoscopic surgical technique may also low risk preterm premature rupture membrane preterm birth compare open fetal surgery . Finally , successful fetoscopic spina bifida repair also make vaginal delivery possible .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spina bifida congenital anomaly result incomplete closure neural tube 22 28 embryological day . Its incidence approximately 2-4 case per 10,000 birth , consider common congenital central nervous system anomaly compatible life ( CDC ) . Open spina bifida present flat defect without cover ( myeloschisis ) , may membranous cover ( meningocele ) , fluid may extrude fluid fill sac ( myelomeningocele MMC ) . Spina bifida lead lifelong sequelae result additional insult nervous system occur fetal life consequence anomaly spinal cord . Downward displacement brain stem result hindbrain herniation Chiari II malformation fetal life lead non-communicating hydrocephalus . Concurrently , intrauterine injury expose neural element lead neurologic dysfunction . Despite improved care technology , 2-year survival affect individual 75 % . The need ventriculoperitoneal shunt hydrocephaly relate level lesion range 88-97 % thoracolumbar lesion . Shunt placement associate complication obstruction , infection , displacement require repeat shunt revision early first year life . The majority ( 75 % ) patient hydrocephaly radiologic evidence Arnold-Chiari II malformation ( hindbrain herniation , brain stem abnormality , small posterior fossa ) , associate symptom apnea , swallow difficulty , quadriparesis , balance issue , coordination difficulty . The lesion level also correlate functional motor level ; general , rate wheelchair-bound increase 17 % sacral lesion 90 % patient thoracic level lesion . Almost 90 % infant spina bifida require intervention foot deformity allow weight bearing activity . Bowel urinary tract complication common , child spina bifida achieve normal intelligence , risk neurocognitive language difficulty might impact school performance ability live independently . The acquired disability tend increase adulthood attribute high rate unexpected death . Overall , frequent form spina bifida MMC associate hydrocephaly , low limb paralysis , bowel bladder dysfunction . The ultimate neurologic deficit occur MMC establish birth think originate two mechanism . First , anatomic abnormality relatively normal spinal cord become secondarily damage intrauterine environment amniotic fluid exposure , direct trauma , hydrodynamic pressure , combination . This `` two-hit hypothesis '' base observation progressive neurologic damage develop fetus MMC gestation advance result irreversible neurologic damage birth . The potential ability ameliorate secondary damage cause exposure utero environment give rise concept fetal surgery MMC repair . The prenatal diagnosis MMC Chiari II malformation determine ultrasound almost case 14-20 week gestation , second trimester diagnosis 97 % sensitive 100 % specific . Accordingly , potential candidate prenatal repair identify early pregnancy leave adequate time detailed anatomic evaluation , genetic workup , multidisciplinary patient counseling . Because lifelong morbidity associate condition ability accurately make prenatal diagnosis spina bifida , idea in-utero surgery improve outcome conceive . Early animal study subsequent human pilot study lay groundwork Management Myelomeningocele Study ( MOMS trial ) . While animal model support concept two-hit theory principle improve neurologic function utero repair , finding could directly extrapolate human application . The National Institutes Health ( NIH ) sponsor multicenter randomize MOMS trial compare outcome prenatal MMC repair standard postnatal management . Prenatal MMC repair perform 19-25 6/7 week gestational age . The fetal repair involve two three layer closure similar neonatal surgery . The neural placode sharply dissect surround tissue . The dura myofascial flap re-approximated neural placode . A running suture use close skin . The coverage must completely `` water tight '' prevent leakage cerebrospinal fluid MMC defect lead hindbrain herniation order prevent amniotic fluid exposure damage neural tissue MMC defect . The uterus close two layer ( run closure interrupt stay suture ) cover omental flap . Following prenatal MMC repair , patient remain near fetal surgery center delivery cesarean section . The study demonstrate prenatal MMC repair associate significantly low rate shunting , hindbrain herniation produce good motor outcome . In prenatal surgery group , functional motor level well two level anatomic level 32 % good one level 11 % compare 12 % 9 % , respectively . The major risk prenatal surgery fetus include chorioamniotic membrane separation ( 26 % vs. 0 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) , spontaneous rupture membrane ( 46 vs. 8 % p &lt; 0.001 ) , spontaneous preterm labor preterm birth ( 38 vs. 14 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) . This lead low gestational age delivery prenatal surgery group 34 week compare 37 week postnatal surgery group ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . Within prenatal surgery group , 13 % patient deliver severely premature gestation &lt; 30 week 33 % 30-34 week . Prenatal MMC repair associate significant maternal risk , include pulmonary edema ( 6 % ) blood transfusion delivery ( 9 % ) . Hysterotomy thin observe 25 % woman uterine dehiscence 1 % woman . Moreover , woman 14 % risk scar dehiscence future pregnancy invariably require delivery cesarean section . The reason increase incidence complication related nature open fetal procedure , involve multi-faceted invasive approach include maternal laparotomy , large hysterotomy uterine edge stapling , open fetal repair spina bifida defect may involve manipulation exposure fetus significant amount time . Nevertheless , MOMS trial demonstrate significant fetal neonatal benefit . While maternal risk remain significant , prenatal MMC repair adopt accept care standard across United States . Fetal endoscopic surgery progress rapidly past decade many fetal therapy center able perform number intricate procedure inside uterus specially design instrument . Since fetoscopy offer less invasive therapeutic option open fetal surgery , several effort develop technique MMC repair goal duplicate beneficial fetal effect avoid significant maternal morbidity . Animal human experimental experience fetoscopic repair MMC report , show feasibility cover defect patch , sealant , full repair . These fetoscopic repair typically perform use least two port . Due complex surgical manipulation , particularly patch closure perform , operative time long associated significant obstetric morbidity . A maneuver associate improved ability perform fetoscopic repair intrauterine insufflation carbon dioxide . This provide dry work area surgeon perform closure . The fetal therapy team Johns Hopkins Center Fetal Therapy previously utilize intrauterine carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) insufflation situation dry surgical environment require . Most recently two port-technique fetoscopic MMC repair CO2 insufflation describe Baylor College Medicine/Texas Children 's Fetal Center use externalized approach . This technique employ laparotomy exteriorize uterus , position access two surgical port regardless placental location . After CO2 insufflation fetal anesthesia administer , MMC repair perform sharp dissection placode use mattress suture . This approach design decrease maternal obstetric risk preserve fetal benefit . The technique employ low-pressure uterine CO2 distention 8-12 mmHg . In addition , significantly quick neural tube repair possible improved access fetus , ability manipulate fetus require position , superior port placement result exteriorized maternal uterus . As result two port require suture uterus allow closed seal minimize gas leakage . Finally , recent advance small diameter surgical instrument ( Storz 1.5 - 3mm surgical set ) allow full surgical repair perform via fetoscopic approach . The purpose current study evaluate feasibility perform fetoscopic spina bifida repair Johns Hopkins Hospital fetal maternal outcome follow approach .</detailed_description>
