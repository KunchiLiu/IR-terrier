	<brief_summary>Dental implant often use replace miss teeth . In fact , US 700,000 implant place every year 2 million implant place world wide . Peri-implant mucositis inflammatory condition affect dental implant recognize risk factor peri-implantitis ( condition affect bone around implant eventually lead implant loss ) . The prevalence Peri-implant Mucositis report literature range 50-90 % whereas prevalence Peri-implantitis report high 20 % . commonly believe dysbiotic microbiome primary cause condition . The inflammatory burden around diseased implant create high-protein environment necessary survival pathogenic bacteria . It logical , therefore , reduce inflammation Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) may create shift dysbiotic microbiome symbiotic microbiome . The aim current study test effect oral NSAIDs peri-implant microbiome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inflammation around dental implant define Peri-implant mucositis Peri-implantitis . Peri-implant mucositis localize inflammation limit mucosal tissue surround implant whereas peri-implantitis advance bone surround implant well . The prevalence Peri-implant Mucositis report literature range 50-90 % whereas prevalence Peri-implantitis report high 20 % . Due fact many similarity clinical manifestation infection gingiva peri-implant mucosal tissue , study attempt compare microbial characteristic around teeth find around implant . Emerging data suggest microbiome around infected teeth similarity dissimilarities peri-implant infection . Such difference may stem different inflammatory characteristic well presence non-vital foreign material ( dental implant ) area . Some know pathogenic strain identify peri-implant sulcus anaerobic a-saccharolytic bacteria , fee adjacent tissue inflammatory exudate . Logically , attenuation inflammation would deprive nearby bacteria nourishment need sustain growth . The use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) control chronic inflammatory disease use extensively medicine . Its action block cyclooxygenase inflammatory pathway in-effect block production Prostaglandin-E2 ( PGE2 ) lead use general pain control well long term use treatment tissue inflammation pain cause rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis , tendinitis bursitis . Offenbacher et al . early 1981 discover patient periodontitis significantly high level PGE2 sulcular fluid gingiva tooth ( GCF ) . In follow study period 18-36 month , Offenbacher observe patient exhibited periodontal attachment loss significantly high level PGE2 . This lead Williams et al . study effect Flurbiprofen , phenylalkanoic derivative family non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , naturally occur periodontal disease animal model period 12 month . The study demonstrate decrease alveolar bone loss flurprofen treat animal 3 , 6 , 9 12 month . William et al follow clinical trial 44 patient self administered peroral flurbiprofen twice daily period 24 month . The study report severely depressed bone loss rate period trial early 6 month administration flurbiprofen continue length trial . Other study drug effect aggressive form disease similar result . These result duplicate around implant well . Jeffcoat et al demonstrated oral intake flurbiprofen help reduce bone loss around implant first year service . Reddy similarly demonstrate use digital subtraction radiography , flurbiprofen take orally able help increase bone density apposition around implant 4 month . The positive effect systemic antibiotic well topical anti microbials pathogenic bacteria gingiva sulcus peri-implant crevice well document indisputable . The removal bacteria help promote tissue health . Similar result document around implant well . However recently reverse approach disease control gain popularity . Instead try reduce bacterial challenge antimicrobial/antibiotic therapy , modulate host response decrease inflammatory destruction tissue , could efficient effective way control disease In decrease inflammatory environment , pathogenic bacteria feed inflammatory exudate would greatly decrease , effect major change microbiome . To date nobody characterize change . The purpose study test effect oral NSAIDS peri-implant microbiome . Also , clinical parameter test correlation microbial finding . Methods : The study design random control double blind clinical trial . Patients visit graduate periodontal clinic Hadassah Medical Center examine eligibility study . Implants peri-implant mucositis ( clinical sign inflammation without radiographically bone loss ) include . Patients ( n=50 ) undergo clinical examination ( include probe depth , presence absence suppuration bleed probe ) sample subgingival bacterial deposit use perio-strip . Patients randomly assign experimental flurbiprofen group ( 100 mg bid ) placebo group ( n=25 group ) . Drug consumption set duration 2 week . At end drug intake period ( day 14 ) two week afterwards ( day 28 ) subject re-examined , include new clinical exam sample subgingival bacterial deposit . The microbiological sample analyze use 16 Ribosomal Pyro-sequencing . The microbiome profile Flurbiprofen group treatment two week post-treatment compare . well microbiome placebo group compare Flurbiprofen group . Statistical difference evaluate use ANOVA Bonferroni correction . Correlation clinical parameter microbiological parameter test use Pearson correlation . Significance : The study ask question whether use well-known NSAID proven beneficial effect maintain mucosal tissue integrity around implant help control prevent peri-implant inflammation . Studies show implant place 5 year previously likely form peri-implant mucositis . Just gingivitis lead periodontal disease , Peri-implant mucositis lead peri-implantitis destructive inflammatory disease put implant survival jeopardy . Therefore , drug limit amount destructive bacteria around implant effective non-invasive method treatment . Additionally use comprehensive taxonomical identification peri-implant micro-genome , good understand bacterial role destructive process associate peri-implant inflammation</detailed_description>
