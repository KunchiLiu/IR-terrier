	<brief_title>The Effects Virtual Colonoscopy Intraocular Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma complicate disease damage optic nerve lead progressive , irreversible vision loss . Glaucoma second lead cause blindness associate elevate intraocular pressure ( IOP ) major risk factor . IOP influence many factor , include ethnicity , heredity , various chemical substance ( exist body external body like drug ) , physical change ( posture , neural vascular autoregulation ) . Virtual colonoscopy common screen test early detection diagnosis colon cancer . The test perform compute tomography ( CT ) inflate colon carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) gas . The procedure perform insert Foley catheter anus . As result gas inflating bowel , consequently , increase abdominal pressure . Raising intra-abdominal pressure may cause rise intraocular pressure . The aim research examine change IOP virtual colonoscopy , aim improve understand relationship intra-abdominal pressure IOP . The study include 100 patient , men woman , schedule virtual colonoscopy test hospital ambulatory .</detailed_description>
