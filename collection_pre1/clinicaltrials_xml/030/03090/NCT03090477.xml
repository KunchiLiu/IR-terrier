	<brief_summary>Owing effective treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) , chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) become chronic disease rise prevalence globally . Although possibility stop TKI therapy CML patient achieve deep molecular response topic active debate investigation , life-long treatment remain current standard care . It estimate 3 % 56 % CML patient adherent prescribed TKI therapy . Poor adherence TKIs could compromise control CML , contribute poor survival . CML patient long-term TKI therapy prone develop certain medication-related issue adverse reaction drug interactions.Occurrence adverse reaction even low grade , show impact CML patient 's health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) adherence treatment . However , prospective high quality evidence show adherence TKIs associate clinical outcome improve CML patient . Therefore , investigator hypothesize medication management intervention pharmacist might improve adherence TKIs , translate good disease response HRQoL CML patient , compare control arm receive standard pharmacy service .</brief_summary>
