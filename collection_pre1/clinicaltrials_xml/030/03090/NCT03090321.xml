	<detailed_description>MyHeart Counts Cardiovascular Health Study smartphone-based mobile cardiovascular health research study . The study utilize mobile health capability smartphones wearable assess daily activity measure general public compare measure cardiovascular health - risk factor fitness . How people divide time among exercise , sedentary behavior , sleep affect cardiovascular health , yet largely go unmeasured . With advancement phone sensor wearables factor straightforward gather measure . The use smartphones large segment population allow data collection unprecedented scale . The investigator aim amass activity cardiovascular health data thousand participant well provide much quantitative data type , duration , intensity daily activity . The MyHeart Counts Cardiovascular Health mobile application provide platform investigation method aim aid participant increase heart healthy activity . The overall goal study develop extensive source data inform future cardiovascular health guideline . In second phase MyHeart Counts Cardiovascular Health Study ( Randomized Assessment Physical Activity Prompts In A Large Ambulatory Population ) investigator conduct randomize controlled clinical trial four different physical activity prompt ( intervention ) effect increase physical activity study population measure change step count . Of note supplement activity data investigator ask participant complete genetic analysis share data MyHeart Counts Cardiovascular Health Study research team . The investigator believe opportunity overlay activity , heart risk genetic data participant great tool discovery .</detailed_description>
