	<brief_summary>The purpose investigate adenosine affect diameter regulation retinal arteriole change oxygen tension . A deep understanding mechanism involve diameter regulation retinal arteriole change oxygen tension use obtain detailed understanding disease change diameter regulation retinal vessel involve disease pathogenesis possibly point new therapeutic option patient retinal vascular disease , diabetic retinopathy retinal vein thrombosis . Preliminary , routine ophthalmological evaluation , measurement blood pressure , electrocardiogram preform insure healthy test person include study . The test person randomly allocate two group , one group protocol 1 follow protocol 2 , group two protocol perform reverse order . Protocol 1 : Using DVA , video record capture diameter retinal vessel change occur stimulation flicker light . The recording last 4.5 minute preform intravenous injection adenosine . Protocol 2 : The procedure similar protocol 1 perform breathe gas mixture reduce oxygen tension 12,5 % , result reduce oxygen saturation blood 85-90 % .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect A2A Adrenoceptor Stimulation Diameter Retinal Arterioles During Hypoxia Vivo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Occlusion retinal vessel lead retinal ischaemia hypoxia important element pathophysiology major vision threaten disease Western World . The hypoxic area release vasodilating factor induce vasodilatation adjacent retinal area order increase blood flow retinal oxygenation . An understanding mechanism underlie vasodilatation may help identify new therapeutic principle modulate retinal blood flow change retinal blood flow secondary hypoxia disease . The present study : Two work hypothesis test : 1 ) That systemic administration A2A adrenoceptor agonist affect retinal blood flow independently systemic effect . 2 ) That vasodilating effect A2A adrenoceptor stimulation vasodilating effect systemic hypoxia increase retinal metabolism induce flicker stimulation additive . Methods : The diameter retinal vessel measure use Dynamic Vessel Analyser ( DVA ) . This apparatus perform video recording ocular fundus , single image video sequence grab computerised analysis . Special software enables calculation diameter vessel basis distance vessel border . The fact image grab real time ( 25 time per second ) allow detection immediate diameter change retinal metabolism increase exposure flicker light ( metabolic autoregulation ) . The A2A adrenoceptor agonist regadenoson administer continuous ECG monitoring single intravenous injection 400 microgram ( 5 ml ) antecubital vein . No dose adjustment necessary body weight , age , renal og hepatic impairment . Due potential ischaemic effect regadenoson , person history arterial hypertension cardiac disease normal blood pressure ECG include . The experiment perform breathe ambient air 10 minute breathe air contain 12.5 % oxygen ( correspond saturation altitude 4100 ) , induce decline arterial oxygen saturation result dilatation retinal vessel . Experimental design : The project conduct open control interventional study perform two day separate least one day . Initial routine ophthalmological evaluation slit lamp examination , measurement intraocular pressure ophthalmoscopy , supplement measurement central retinal thickness use optical coherence tomography scan preform measure ECG blood pressure make sure healthy test person include . The test person randomly allocate two group , one group protocol 1 follow protocol 2 , group two protocol perform reverse order . Protocol 1 : A ) Using DVA , diameter large retinal vascular arcade arteriole record 90 second baseline follow similar record stimulation flicker light record rest , altogether last 4.5 minute B ) Intravenous injection 0,4 mg regadenoson repetition procedure step A Protocol 2 : The procedure similar protocol 1 perform breathe hypoxic gas mixture .</detailed_description>
