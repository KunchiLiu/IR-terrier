	<detailed_description>Musculoskeletal disorder degeneration represent injury pain body 's joint ligament , tendon , muscle , nerve , skeletal element support extremity , spine relate tissue . Direct injury age contribute breakdown inflammation tissue , lead debilitation loss function area . This major impact quality life , occupational/recreation limitation , psychosocial implication . Many therapy employ include medication , physical therapy , occupational therapy , variety surgical intervention distinct limitation , often cover issue versus provide actual heal return function . Many report available utilizing self-healing option include use stem/stromal cell ( either adipose marrow ) use target placement cell , matrix platelet concentrate . This term Biocellular therapy , typically optimize use ultrasound guidance . It propose use cellular isolates derive large deposit cell ( adipose great marrow ) , may use conjunction target placement stand alone methodology parenteral use . This study design interventional mean examine safety efficacy use cellular stromal vascular fraction ( cSVF ) musculoskeletal pain , dysfunction degeneration inflammatory disorder . The important cellular component represent , adipocyte , heterogeneous cell group associate peri-vasculature . The group include certain cell refer `` stem '' `` stromal '' cell , consider key element cellular biocellular treatment . The carrier microvascular tissue , adipose , show participate wound heal cellular replacement per se . It well establish perivascular ( adventitial ) cell type find essentially tissue body , high number easily access depot subdermal fat . It propose area group respond result `` signal '' permit chemotactic request need growth factor cytokines effectively contribute heal capability fail damage site . This Trial investigate safety/efficacy either combine specific target ( ultrasound ) and/or without systemic parenteral route introduction . This study include closed syringe , disposable microcannula harvest subdermal fat tissue obtain native perivascular stromal element ( extracellular matrix ( ECM ) periadventitial cell show multipotent ( potential ) , incubation , digestion isolation cSVF . This isolated concentration stem/stromal cellular pellet ( without actual extracellular matrix stromal scaffold element ) suspend 500 cc sterile Normal Saline ( NS ) deploy via peripheral intravenous route . Evaluations safety issue measure interval ( severe non-severe category ) ultrasound image study . Biocellular treatment define use tissue stromal vascular fraction ( tSVF ) obtain within adipose tissue complex ( ATC ) , combine high density platelet rich plasma ( HD PRP ) concentrate standard blood draw . Concentration FDA approve platelet concentrate device achieve level &gt; 4 time patient 's measure baseline level . Such concentrate show provide important growth factor cytokine ( signal protein ) naturally involve wound heal repair function . A form Cell-Enriched Biocellular Therapy ( CEBT ) available component study , tSVF + HD PRP enhance cellular number via process isolate concentrate cSVF discuss . Many small case series case report publish peer review medical literature suggest intervention safe effective relieving musculoskeletal disorder include study . This study intend provide evidence non-drug safety efficacy use intervention . Evaluation track adverse event severe adverse event ( SAE ) track accord interval describe . Examination optimal number cell , viability cell , evaluation efficacy statistically study report relative outcome .</detailed_description>
