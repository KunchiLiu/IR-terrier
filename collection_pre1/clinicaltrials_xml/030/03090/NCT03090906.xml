	<brief_title>Soft Tissue Volume Gain Stability Comparing Palate Tuberosity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Understanding importance soft tissue around implant lead clinician develop surgical approach augment . The majority , describe bilaminar technique obtain subephitelial connective tissue graft ( SCTG ) palate ( P ) . However , recent study demonstrate tuberosity ( T ) tissue dense coarse tissue seem contain collagen less fat glandular tissue P , therefore may better tissue quality soft tissue augmentation , limited scientific evidence compare area . The main goal study compare soft tissue volume gain stability around implant case SCTG dimension P T use randomly . To calculate volume change stability intraoral optical scan use three-dimensional image superimpose . The secondary goal compare histologically tissue change clinical parameter . Histomorphometry immunohistochemistry evaluate level Type I-III collagen , long lysyl hydroxylase , matrix metalloproteinase 1-2 , monoclonal antibody cytokeratin 4-10-13 performed .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must ≥18 year able understand nature propose surgery sign informed consent . Implant must locate 2 fixed reference point i.e . clinical crown . All implant location need soft tissue volume augmentation . Palate must ≥2mm thickness premolar area . Tuberosity &gt; 12mm length . Full mouth plaque bleed score &lt; 20 % . Previous soft tissue augmentation area . Heavy Smokers ( &gt; 10 cigarette per day ) . Local systemic condition would interfere routine periodontal therapy ( non control diabetes , liver function disorder , immunosuppressant disease , autoimmune disease ) . Allergy NonSteroidal AntiInflammatory Drugs . Patients take medication cause gingival enlargement Gingival idiopatic overgrowth</criteria>
