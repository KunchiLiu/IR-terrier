	<brief_summary>Brain function support multiple cell type , include neuronal non-neuronal cell connect complex network . When connectivity cell alter disrupt , function brain impaired . In stroke , interruption blood supply neural circuit result connectivity damage permanent disability . Experimental evidence suggest type brain state , include sleep , protect brain tissue stroke `` repair '' damage circuit . This project investigate neuronal mechanism underlie protective effect sleep brain connectivity network activity . To end , investigator use collection state-of-the-art technology include high-density electroencephalography ( hd-EEG ) , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) transcranial alternate current stimulation ( tACS ) . Perspectives include good understanding cause consequence perturb electrical activity brain sleep stroke patient .</brief_summary>
