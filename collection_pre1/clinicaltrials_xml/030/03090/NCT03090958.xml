	<brief_title>AllyQuest : Engaging HIV+ YMSM Care Through Social Networking Gamification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 Design develop AllyQuest novel theory-based mobile health ( mHealth ) intervention newly diagnose HIV+ YMSM . Using iterative research design investigator work YABs Ayogo , global leader application game psychology health behavior change , develop tailor intervention content maximal relevance usability newly diagnose HIV+ YMSM . The investigator use content within exist evidence base intervention ( EBIs ) develop person live HIV , include MSM youth develop informational content deliver AllyQuest . Activities EBIs translate daily activity participant within AllyQuest receive . To maximize intervention appeal appropriateness target population , investigator convene two youth advisory board ( YABs ) provide insight feedback intervention development process . The investigator recruit 4-5 HIV+ YMSM site ( Chicago North Carolina ) serve YAB member first year study . The investigator ensure YAB member representative target population term age , race/ethnicity , sexual orientation/identity , length time since diagnosis . At monthly in-person meeting , two Youth Advisory Boards ( YAB ) - consist 4 5 HIV+ MSMâ€”will evaluate intervention content develop ( include imagery messaging ) acceptability relevance . Specifically , investigator ask YAB member react write tailored content term content 's readability , comprehension , relevance . The investigator also elicit YABs ' view follow area intervention design : ( ) intervention structure format [ e.g. , organization intervention , appropriateness appeal language/images , ease navigate web-based content ] ; ( b ) intervention content [ e.g. , relevance/applicability intervention content population , comprehension content , interest content ] ; ( c ) intervention activity [ e.g. , comprehension activity instruction , acceptability/relevance activity , desire engage activity ] ; ( ) overall impression intervention [ e.g. , overall utility , overall interest , overall enjoyment ] . Two YABs utilized ensure maximal diversity viewpoint developmental stage intervention development . During first six month year one , YAB member meet research team monthly , critical time develop intervention material . In addition , web-based meeting email communication use review material in-person session . Intervention Development Usability Testing Prototype idea develop iterative fashion Ayogo develop low-fidelity clickable prototype demonstrate information architecture high-level feature application . Members research app development team conduct internal usability `` beta test '' ensure functionality . After discover problem fix , 4-5 member target population recruit describe North Carolina site 4-5 member target population Chicago site participate usability test . Usability test ass user comprehension educational content , understand use intervention feature , overall impression app relevance appeal . Testing conducted accordance NIH usability guideline . Each participant ask meet research team member member development team guide , interactive tour app . Participants ask share thought impression aloud move different component feature app . Audiotapes test session along video tape app screen participant ' hand analyze pattern use usability problem , result compile report developer research team , include recommendation address problem identify . Ongoing adjustment require agile , iterative approach throughout usability test member target population . Specific Aim 2 Conduct one-month pilot trial AllyQuest 20 newly diagnose HIV+ YMSM . To ensure feature , platform content AllyQuest acceptable target population technical challenge user concern , investigator conduct one-month pilot trial use . The research assistant ( RA ) meet participant person explain study detail , facilitate app download login onto participant ' phone , provide app site tour highlight feature . Participants complete baseline demographic risk assessment administer via computer assist survey instrument ( CASI ) . At end one-month field trial , participant undergo debrief session evaluate experience use app , overall satisfaction problem encounter . Individuals instruct contact research coordinator immediately report difficulty app component report problem phone phone service . A help link embed within app directly link study staff assistance need . Strategies use prior team research study employ research staff train cultural sensitivity experience work HIV+YMSM , provide appropriate monetary incentive participation study evaluation , use available resource maintain contact employ . The investigator evaluate participant experience AllyQuest understand technology utilization specific focus usability mechanism action might underlie potential effectiveness intervention ( quality/timing message , privacy concern ) quality patient-technology relationship ( trust , communication , intrusiveness , health promotion ) . The investigator also examine barrier facilitator implementation . At end one-month pilot trial , participant complete quantitative survey administer via computer assist survey instrument ( CASI ) . Qualitative exit interview allow in-depth nuanced understanding intervention acceptability . Interviews semistructured focus participant use AllyQuest one-month pilot trial perceive use intervention could translate behavior change .</detailed_description>
