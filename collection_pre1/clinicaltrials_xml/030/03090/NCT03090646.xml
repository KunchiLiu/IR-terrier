	<brief_summary>The investigator interest whether use small financial incentive ( gift card ) increase rate follow-up compliance among live kidney donor . The investigator aim test randomly assign live kidney donor intervention ( gift card time follow-up visit ) control arm ( standard care ) upon discharge initial kidney donation hospitalization , track follow-up compliance time . The study population approximately 320 live kidney donor undergo donor nephrectomy Johns Hopkins Hospital ( 80/year 4 year ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Financial Incentives Increase Live Kidney Donor Follow-up Compliance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Scientific Rationale : Live kidney donor provide nearly 1/3 kidney use transplantation United States year . While surgical procedure live donation pose minimal immediate risk donor , live donation associate increase risk development chronic disease include hypertension kidney disease . A meta-analysis 5,145 live kidney donor demonstrate large increase blood pressure would expect normal age . Preliminary data investigator ' research group recently demonstrate incidence end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) fifteen year post donation 30.8 per 10,000 donor compare 3.9 per 10,000 match healthy non-donors . Utilization healthcare resource play important role mitigation chronic disease , potential effect development chronic condition live donor . Kidney donor unique population . They otherwise healthy individual lose half renal mass risk long-term sequela . As , donor treat healthy adult , require great surveillance follow donation . There 5,500 new live kidney donor enter organ transplant system year , center historically poor follow-up . The Organ Procurement Transplantation Network/United Network Organ Sharing ( OPTN/UNOS ) collect follow-up data live kidney donor , include serum creatinine , blood pressure , body mass index 6 month 1 year post donation since 1999 . However , approximately half live kidney donor incomplete 1 year follow-up data one-third lost follow-up . Results national survey 2010 find 40 % center lose contact 75 % donor 2 year post-donation . By 2011 , national effort underway improve live donor follow-up , 2013 , OPTN implement national policy improve follow-up require transplant center reach certain threshold collect record data live kidney donor time . Over course last year , compliance threshold increase , OPTN require 80 % clinical data ( presence hypertension , diabetes , dialysis , kidney related complication , recent hospitalization , medical insurance status , income , vital status ) 70 % laboratory data ( serum creatinine urine protein ) record submit live kidney donor . Financial incentivization employ realm healthcare change health-related behavior , encourage compliance medication ultimately improve health outcome . Monetary reward show associated high rate abstinence smoke 6 month . However , randomize clinical trial evaluate efficacy lottery-based incentive show benefit subgroup patient high risk poor adherence baseline . While research demonstrate benefit lottery-based incentive scheme vs direct monetary incentive raise participation among worker provide health risk assessment , participation rate still quite low even best group ( 64 % vs 40 % ) . Rationale : With historically poor follow-up increase risk development chronic disease related loss renal mass , live kidney donor vulnerable group need intervention prevent poor outcome . As transplant center strive follow-up compliance 80 % , new creative incentive role increase compliance rate population . However , give uncertainty impact monetary incentive literature , investigator believe best perform randomize control trial incentivization live kidney donation follow-up compliance prior implement center-wide action would provide incentivization every patient . The investigator hypothesize live kidney donor receive small-amount gift card follow completion follow-up requirement high rate follow-up patient incentivized . Potential Risks Benefits : There risk information participant could become know . However , risk minimal , data gather keep completely confidential best ability research team . Participant name identifying information know few number personnel possible order carry study , data de-identified prior analysis order limit risk exposure protect health information . There direct benefit study participation , small-amount incentive intervention arm . Participation study would help provider , patient , future live kidney donor contribute potential increase follow-up live kidney donor . Objectives Purpose : The primary objective study compare rate follow-up compliance live kidney donor receive small-amount gift card incentive rate receive incentive . The investigator compare rate follow-up 6 month , 1 year , 2 year intervention control arm . The secondary objective evaluate effectiveness small incentive overall compliance comprehensive transplant center , reach goal OPTN threshold 80 % clinical 70 % laboratory compliance live kidney donor . The purpose trial evaluate utility small-amount gift card meet national standard center-level , increase provision high-quality follow-up care live-kidney donor .</detailed_description>
