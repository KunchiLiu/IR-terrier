	<brief_summary>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death U.S. throughout world . Lung cancer broadly divide histologically small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . About 25 % patient NSCLC stage I II disease . The primary treatment modality surgical resection,2 5-year survival rate 65 % stage I 41 % stage II disease . However , 70 % patient NSCLC present stage III IV disease . Patients stage III disease commonly treat chemoradiation , 5-year survival rate 26 % . Chemotherapy target therapy often use stage IV disease , 5-year survival rate 4 % . Tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) target therapy specific molecule critical cell-signaling pathway involve lung carcinogenesis . The currently available FDA approve TKIs advance NSCLC include afatinib , gefitinib , erlotinib inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signal 6 crizotinib inhibits anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) signal . However , tumor carry correspond oncogenic mutation ( e.g. , sensitize EGFR mutation ) would respond well TKIs . Meta-analyses clinical trial evaluate efficacy gefitinib erlotinib demonstrate NSCLC patient EGFR mutation-positive low risk disease progression treat EGFR-TKI compare treat chemotherapy ( HR = 0.43 , 95 % confidence interval , CI=0.38-0.49 ) . EGFR-TKI , however , confers benefit patient EGFR wildtype ( HR = 1.06 , 95 % CI=0.94-1.19 ) . A phase III trial crizotinib also demonstrate superiority crizotinib standard chemotherapy ALK-positive NSCLC patient ( HR = 0.49 ; 95 % CI=0.37-0.64 ) . In Hong Kong , part Asia like China Taiwan , majority lung cancer patient smoker , also prominence non-smokers lung cancer . Compared Caucasians , also relatively high incidence EGFR mutation lung adenocarcinoma . The prevalence EGFR mutation Asian population lung adenocarcinomas reach 60 % compare 30 % Caucasian population . These EGFR mutant tumor demonstrate good response drug EGFR-TKI , boost response rate almost 70 % compare 30 % conventional chemotherapy lung cancer . Even remarkable response , however , EGFR-TKI eventually fail EGFR mutant lung cancer . There imminent need look newer therapeutic target agents overcome acquire resistance anti-cancer drug explore alternative molecular signaling pathway could interact enhance EGFR signal pathway modulate therapeutic response lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although EGFR- ALK-TKIs achieve response rate high 70 % , patient treat TKIs invariably develop resistance therapy . The median progression-free survival 10-16 month . The common mechanism acquire resistance TKIs therapy-induced clonal selection minor subpopulation resistant cancer cell present original tumor . Emergence EGFR mutation T790M occur 50-70 % patient acquire resistance EGFR-TKIs . Other EGFR mutation mutation phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) B-Raf Proto-Oncogene ( BRAF ) also associate EGFR-TKI resistance , occur low frequency . Resistance ALK-TKI complex involve various resistant mutation . TKI resistance remain major problem clinical management NSCLC . Patients acquire resistance treat second generation TKIs , though none FDA approve yet , combination therapy strategy . Therefore , molecular characterization tumor throughout course disease helpful match new drug tumor 's evolve genomic profile guide effective personalized therapy . However , serial tissue sample monitor molecular signature tumor invasive , impractical , routine clinical practice . Obtaining sufficient tissue material genotyping also major hurdle tissue sampling . There need develop technology permit non-invasive serial analysis tumor genomic profile . Cell-free circulate DNA fragment DNA find circulation associate cell cell fragment . When tumor cell die , release tumor DNA bloodstream . The cell-free circulating DNA derive tumor , know circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) , carry mutation present tumor hence distinguish cell-free circulating DNA derive normal cell . It show detection ctDNA concentration correlate tumor stage cancer survival . Moreover , ctDNA plasma use detect genomic alteration solid cancer , high concordance detect mutation pair formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) plasma DNA sample . In study acquire resistance EGFR blockade colorectal cancer patient , repeat serum sample collect 4-week interval disease progression . Using mathematical modeling , study follow important finding : resistant mutation present clonal subpopulation within tumor prior initiation treatment , take fairly consistent period time ( 5-6 month ) subclone expand repopulate lesion , circulate resistant mutation could detect several month radiographic evidence disease progression . This seminal study demonstrate potential use ctDNA test track genomic evolution selection tumor non-invasive manner order facilitate individualize therapy hence prolong remission . The investigator demonstrate plasma detection EGFR mutation patient advanced stage lung adenocarcinoma bear EGFR mutation , correlate prognosis subject EGFR-TKI . One prospective study use real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) detect EGFR mutation ctDNA patient advance NSCLC . Among patient EGFR mutation + baseline ( pre-treatment ) , lose EGFR mutation cycle 3 treatment ( chemotherapy +/- erlotinib ) good progression free survival ; median survival 7.2 vs. 12.0 month patient EGFR mutation ( + , + ) ( + , - ) baseline cycle 3 , respectively . Other study also demonstrate feasibility oncogenic mutation especially KRAS mutation . Although study demonstrate feasibility detect tumor mutation ctDNA , limited examine single gene ( e.g. , EGFR KRAS ) . Other study apply next generation sequence patient NSCLC . Max Diehn 's lab Stanford University develop method quantify ctDNA deep sequencing &gt; 130 gene . In 17 patient paired plasma DNA tumor tissue sample , able detect mutation previously identify tissue plus many additional somatic variant . They also find level ctDNA highly correlated tumor volume . Their study examine multiple gene , prospective component track ctDNA mutation correlate specific mutation treatment outcome . Testing ctDNA patient receive chemotherapy never do . Genomic profile identify mutation associate resistance response chemotherapy . The investigator therefore propose longitudinal study patient advance NSCLC treat first-line TKI chemotherapy collect serial blood sample prospectively , use next-generation sequencing ctDNA , examine evolutionary genomic profile . This study aim evaluate utility ctDNA test identifying genomic marker predict treatment response survival patient advance NSCLC . This propose study examine utility ctDNA identify genomic marker NSCLC prognosis patient treat first-line TKI chemotherapy . After diagnosis , patient follow 3-month interval . At study visit , plasma sample collect , whenever clinically indicate , tissue sample also obtain . Genomic profiling tumor do FFPE tissue sample ctDNA extract prospectively collect plasma sample . The aim : 1 . To determine concordance discordance somatic mutation find ctDNA tumor tissue DNA . 2 . To identify mutation ctDNA associate prognosis ( treatment response progression-free survival ) patient receive ( ) EGFR-TKI treatment , ( b ) ALK-TKI treatment , ( c ) chemotherapy . 3 . To track molecular time course term ( ) variation total ctDNA concentration time , ( b ) mutation associate resistance/recurrence first detectable plasma , ( c ) mutation fraction resistance-associated mutation vary time . 4 . To combine information Aims 2 3 develop prediction model prognosis patient receive ( ) EGFR-TKI treatment , ( b ) ALK-TKI treatment , ( c ) chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
