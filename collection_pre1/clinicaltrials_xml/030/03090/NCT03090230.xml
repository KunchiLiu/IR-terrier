	<brief_title>Study Relay Pro® Thoracic Stent-Graft Subjects With Traumatic Injury Descending Thoracic Aorta</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicenter , non-blinded , non-randomized study RelayPro Thoracic Stent-Graft subject traumatic injury DTA subject candidate endovascular repair.The primary objective study all-cause mortality 30 day post procedure . The secondary objective trial include descriptive analysis procedural post-procedural observation 5 year follow-up .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age ≥18 year . 2 . Subject must traumatic injury descend thoracic aorta occur 30 day prior plan stent implant procedure . 3 . Proximal distal landing zone diameter 19 mm 42 mm . 4 . Subject must proximal attachment zone distal leave common carotid distal attachment zone proximal origin celiac artery . 5 . The length attachment zone depend intend stent graft diameter . . The proximal attachment zone : . 15 mm 22 28 mm graft bare stent ( 20 mm RelayPro graft nonbare stent ) . ii . 20 mm 30 46 mm graft bare stent ( 25 mm RelayPro graft nonbare stent ) . b . The distal attachment zone 20 mm Relay Pro graft . Coverage leave subclavian artery permit . Revascularization leave subclavian artery may consider case treat physician , especially , anatomy revascularization determine clinically necessary 7 . Proximal distal attachment zone contain straight segment ( nontapered , nonreverse taper , define &lt; 10 % diameter change ) lengths equal great require attachment length intend device . 8 . Adequate iliac femoral artery access introduction RelayPro delivery system . Alternative method gain proper access may utilize ( e.g. , iliac conduit ) . 9 . Subject willing comply followup evaluation schedule . 10 . Subject ( Legally Authorized Representative , LAR ) agree sign Informed Consent Form prior treatment . Significant stenosis , calcification , thrombus , tortuosity intend fixation site would compromise fixation seal device . 2 . Planned coverage leave carotid celiac artery ; anatomic variant may compromise circulation carotid , vertebral , innominate artery device placement , amenable subclavian revascularization . 3 . Prior endovascular surgical repair DTA . The device may place within prior endovascular surgical graft . 4 . Concomitant aneurysm/disease ascend aorta , aortic arch , abdominal , aorta require repair . 5 . Prior abdominal aortic aneurysm repair ( endovascular surgical ) perform less 6 month prior plan stent implant procedure . 6 . Untreatable allergy sensitivity contrast medium device component . 7 . Known suspected connective tissue disorder . 8 . Blood coagulation disorder bleed diathesis treatment suspend one week pre and/or postrepair . 9 . Coronary artery disease unstable angina . 10 . Severe congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association functional class IV ) . 11 . Stroke and/or Myocardial Infarction within 3 month plan treatment date . 12 . Pulmonary disease require routine ( daily nightly ) need oxygen therapy outside hospital setting . 13 . Acute renal failure chronic renal insufficiency , receive dialysis . 14 . Hemodynamically unstable . 15 . Active systemic infection and/or mycotic aneurysm . 16 . Morbid obesity condition may compromise prevent necessary imaging requirement . 17 . Injury Severity Score 75 . 18 . Less twoyear life expectancy . 19 . Current planned participation investigational drug device study complete primary endpoint evaluation . 20 . Currently pregnant plan become pregnant course study . 21 . Medical , social , psychological issue Investigator believe may interfere treatment followup .</criteria>
