	<detailed_description>All study activity take place Umlazi township eThekwini district . The township serve one regional hospital , Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital , referral hospital 17 primary health care clinic . Participants involve study delivery 9 month postpartum . The intervention study deliver two cohort ( n=240 per cohort ) . The first cohort enrol beginning May 2017 . The investigator anticipate 4 adolescent mother enrol per day base monthly number adolescent delivery Prince Mshiyieni hospital capacity . Therefore , investigator finish enrol first cohort July 2017 . The first cohort complete end line assessment December 2017-February 2018 . The investigator begin enrol second cohort September 2017 complete enrollment November 2017 . The second cohort complete end line assessment June-August , 2018 . Primary outcome analysis complete October , 2018 . MAMAS Intervention The investigator roll program two cohort adolescent mother ( n=240 per cohort ) ; mentor mother work 10 adolescent mother per cohort . Within cohort , intervention arm control arm ( N=240 per arm cohort ) . The participant program arm 15 group session mentor 2 home visit 3 weeks-6 month postpartum . Investigators use participatory visual method ( e.g. , photovoice , journaling , draw ) throughout program implementation adolescent mother understand facilitate process resilience development . As one example , part mentor process , adolescent mother may ask engage reflexive journaling . Mentor mother ask adolescent mother comfortable share excerpt journal particular group session . Through group session , adolescent mother identify common barrier face work together overcome . Mentor mother keep weekly log document covered session ; abstract part ongoing monitoring evaluation . All 480 participant complete baseline behavioral biological assessment ( HIV HSV-2 test ) 2 week postpartum additional baseline biological assessment ( Trichomonas vaginalis , Neisseria gonorrhea Chlamydia trachomatis test ) 6 week postpartum . Further , participant receive regular postpartum well-baby visit 6 week , 10 week , 14 week 6 month adolescent-friendly study nurse . During visit , participant complete routine assessment . At 9-months postpartum , participant complete end line behavioral biological assessment ( HIV , HSV-2 Trichomonas vaginalis , Neisseria gonorrhea Chlamydia trachomatis test ) . Provision Privacy All participant receive adolescent-friendly clinical service study nurse postnatal period . The study nurse provide standard care clinical service , go training ensure provide youth-friendly care . In addition , train research assistant administer behavioral assessment available query participant complete survey . The research assistant complete training multicultural sensitivity , gender-based violence , ethical guideline recommend WHO Violence Against Women ( VAW ) study engage participant supportive non-judgmental manner , deal sensitive issue , respond distress participant . Additionally , follow system place maintain cohort retention follow protect privacy interest subject : At enrollment , study participant ask willing share telephone number , physical home address postal address . Women tell provide information entirely voluntary , use follow woman remind appointment . Study participant intervention trial contact text message prior study visit remind visit . Study participant miss schedule appointment contact within 24 hour . The first line contact SMS . The second reminder telephone call participant directly close contact identify client , maintain confidentiality . If study staff reach participant , call per day next three day . If tracer still reach participant end third day , tracer home visit home location provide participant . Home visit do tracer familiar residential area . For propose study , investigator employ two full-time tracer . If participant change address maximum information gather ( maintain confidentiality participant ) neighbor relatives form basis contact . A participant consider lose follow-up 3 unsuccessful attempt phone contact 2 unsuccessful home visit . A SMS phone script use contact woman remind appointment . A similar system trace study participant use previous clinical trial implement resulted retention rate higher 75 % , adverse event associate trace report . Data Management Analysis Data primarily manage on-site data entry management team . All risk minimize staff ethic training , layer data security restrict access sensitive information staff member specific need information . Furthermore , part training investigator conduct staff member , investigator include train module confidential nature data . Investigators conduct similar training module research staff study . Following training , staff sign Oath Confidentiality . Data Security Data All participant assign participant identifier ( PID ) randomization . Thereafter , biological non-biological samples/data identifiable vis-a-vis PID . Participant 's name never appear samples/data . Further , consent form form personal identifier keep separate data file key-locked filing cabinet . A computerized follow-up system link identification number personal information keep computer password protection . Only site PI , Dr. Daya Moodley authorize study staff complete required ethic train access computer . Protection loss data provide schedule backup data file . Non-biological Data Data collect use Samsung Galaxy equivalent Tablets run customize version Android operating system . The investigator multiple level security measure ensure safety data tablet . With customized version operate system , interviewer allow access certain apps setting tablet . A password require activate tablet second password must enter access data capture software . There also separate level access interviewer , field supervisor , system administrator . Only users administrator level access delete data previously capture . Further , data capture device machine-readable ( xml ) format easy interpret without use computer program . To add another layer security , data transfer project server , remove device . As additional security measure , lose steal tablet track data erase remotely data team lose steal tablet connect Wi-Fi cellular network . All data capture tablet transmit project server use HTTPS , widely-used communication protocol secure communication computer network . HTTPS provide authentication web app associate web server one communicating , protect malicious attack . Additionally , provide bidirectional encryption communication client server , protect eavesdrop tamper and/or forge content communication . Once data project server , allow real time monitor progress field , report via automate Benchmark reporting table password protect website , facilitate monitor status data collection , help make rapid correction assure timely adherence timeline . In addition , data process create incremental Stata datasets every week send email encrypt format Project coordinator , turn run weekly QC activity return query field staff . Data Collection , Storage Sharing Biological Data Biological specimen store CAPRISA repository -70 refrigerator . The sample store temperature control monitor environment . Specimens store assay complete dependent receipt fund relevant assay propose . Repository staff maintain sample daily access sample . Statistical Analysis The investigator use appropriate bivariate multivariate analysis test whether adolescent mother receive intervention lower level STIs HIV risk control arm . Multivariate analysis use measure association treatment arm school reenrollment . For HIV-positive participant , investigator assess whether receive intervention increase retention care . Analyses complete use SAS statistical program . Power Analysis Investigators use data previous trial set help estimate appropriate sample size RCT [ 1 ] . Specifically , previous study , investigator 26.5 % prevalence consistent condom use 21.6 % prevalence STI control group postpartum assessment . Outcome 1 : STI . Investigators estimate total sample size need follow-up detect standardize effect ( ) .20 ( OR=.69 ) intervention STI 80 % power ( 2-sided , alpha=.05 ) 350 ( total across arm ) . The investigator inflate sample size assume attrition rate baseline follow-up 25 % ( 350/.70=467 ) . Outcome 2 : Inconsistent condom use . The investigator estimate total sample size need follow-up detect standardize effect ( ) .20 ( OR=.69 ) intervention inconsistent condom use 80 % power ( 2-sided , alpha=.05 ) 314 ( total across arm ) . Investigators inflate sample size assume attrition rate baseline follow-up 25 % ( 314/.70=419 ) . While investigator estimate 467 participant would provide sufficient power detect effect STI outcomes , investigator increase sample size 480 participant 12 mentor mother would deliver intervention equal number participant ( n=10 ) cohort .</detailed_description>
