	<detailed_description>A . Specific Aims/Objectives : The goal study identify significant clinical laboratory risk factor pediatric patient significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding . This define bleed necessitates upper endoscopic evaluation either diagnose treat upper GI bleeding hospital admission . If predictive/risk stratification relationship exist , data could permit effective triaging intervention scheme pediatric patient present complaint gastrointestinal bleeding . In addition want get good understand re-bleeding rate endoscopic therapy upper GI bleeding identifiable risk factor re-bleeding . Lastly want understand best practice management upper GI bleeding . B . Background Significance : Gastrointestinal ( GI ) hemorrhage potentially life-threatening presentation pediatric gastroenterologist must recognize , manage appropriately . Classification generally divide upper low GI bleeding , base origin bleed relative hemorrhage Ligament Treitz . The incidence GI bleeding child well establish pediatric population . For upper GI bleeds large , prospective study assess incidence pediatric critical care setting . In one prospective study 984 patient , upper GI bleeds occur 6.4 % admission receive prophylactic therapy . Other study show upper GI bleed many 25 % pediatric intensive care admission without prophylaxis . There data incidence pediatric GI bleeds require endoscopic therapy . Pediatric study lack respect risk stratification decisional algorithm manage pediatric acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding . Adult literature support accurate stratification risk base clinical history , physical examination , laboratory measure . Additionally , endoscopic intervention allow therapeutic intervention also prognosticate base visual finding . Similar pediatric literature available thus give rise large amount variability center center well within center regard management decision making . C. Design Methods : - Prospective , observational analysis inpatient ambulatory record pediatric patient Boston Children 's Hospital beginning upon IRB approval . - We identify pediatric patient &lt; /= 21 year old presenting acutely emergency room , ambulatory clinic current inpatient require endoscopic evaluation acute upper gastrointestinal bleed potential treatment . - Data collect include clinical sign symptom physical exam feature , laboratory study endoscopic finding - Identified patient follow prospectively outcomes data collection . - Data collection include : - Clinical history bleeding onset , acuity , amount , frequency prior history gastrointestinal bleed . - Medication history - Physical examination data include vital sign ( heart rate , blood pressure , oxygen saturation ) - Laboratory data include - Complete blood count - Inflammatory marker ( ESR CRP ) - Liver panel - Complete Metabolic Panel - Urinanalysis - Endoscopic finding well data intervention ( cautery , clip , injection ) - Medical management decision ( acid suppression therapy , oral intake , frequency laboratory measurement ) - Outcome data include re-bleeding rate ( respect endoscopic intervention ) , laboratory measure , length stay .</detailed_description>
