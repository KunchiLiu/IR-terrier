	<brief_title>Role Circulating MicroRNAs Pathogenesis Aneurysms Abdominal Thoracic Aorta - Study `` Micro AAA ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aneurysm abdominal thoracic aorta represent major cause cardiovascular morbidity mortality . The course condition stay asymptomatic long , first manifestation acute rupture aneurysm sac life-threatening bleeding . Detection patient risk early treatment significantly reduce percentage potentially lethal complication . Aortic disease often degenerative process vary involvement genetic predisposition . In literature , substantial number gene prove affect metabolism vessel wall determine production structural protein , associate vascular pathology . Pathophysiologic mechanisms lesion aortic wall completely understood . Among , include endothelial dysfunction , chronic inflammation vessel wall , apoptosis smooth muscle cell degradation extracellular matrix , result loss integrity layer vessel wall decrease strength , lead dilation , rupture dissection . Apart mutation gene cod structural protein vessel wall , many potential biomarkers propose early diagnosis aortic aneurysm . These include microRNA ( miRNA ) , one-fibre chain non-coding ribonucleic acid several nucleotide long involved gene expression mechanism inhibition mRNA translation increase degradation . Recently , association level miRNAs presence growth aortic aneurysm describe .</detailed_description>
