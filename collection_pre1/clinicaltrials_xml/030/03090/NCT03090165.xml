	<brief_title>Ribociclib Bicalutamide AR+ TNBC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : - bicalutamide - 150mg po daily D1 - D28 ( Cycle = 28 day ) - ribociclib po daily D1 - D21 28 day cycle PHASE I SAFETY RUN-IN COHORT : The maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) bicalutamide combination ribociclib determine use standard `` 3+3 '' design . The first cohort 3 subject receive ribociclib 400mg po daily D1 - D21 28 day cycle ( Dose Level 1 ) . If DLTs experience next cohort 3 subject receive ribociclib 400mg po daily D1 - D28 28 day cycle ( Dose Level 2 ) . If DLTs experience next cohort 3 subject receive ribociclib 600mg po daily D1 - D21 28 day cycle ( Dose Level 3 ) . If DLTs experience Dose Level 3 , 3 additional subject treat level declare MTD . DLTs assess within first cycle ( 28 day ) . PHASE II INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : - co-therapy bicalutamide 150mg po daily D1 - D28 - ribociclib po RP2D determine Phase I Safety Run-In Cohort Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 1 within 28 day prior registration Life expectancy &gt; 12 week determine treat physician . Hematological : - White blood cell ( WBC ) ≥4 × 10^9/L - Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥1.5 × 10^9/L - Hemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥9 g/dL - Platelets ( Plt ) ≥100 × 10^9/L Renal : - Creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL OR - Calculated creatinine clearance ≥50 ml/min use Cockcroft-Gault formula Hepatic : - Bilirubin ≤upper limit normal ( ULN ) * - Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤2.5 × ULN ≤5 × ULN liver mets . - Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤2.5 × ULN ≤5 × ULN liver mets . * For subject Gilbert 's syndrome , apply direct bilirubin .</detailed_description>
