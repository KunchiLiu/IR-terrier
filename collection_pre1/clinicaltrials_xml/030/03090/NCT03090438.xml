Varicocele common cause male factor infertility ( MFI ) responsible 30-35 % primary 69-81 % secondary MFI . Varicocele repair show improve sperm parameter increase natural pregnancy rate result assist reproductive technique ( ART ) . There two possible treatment pathway varicocele associate male factor infertility . 1 ) standard IVF/ICSI 2 ) varicocele repair follow IVF/ICSI spontaneous pregnancy . There however consensus pathway preferable randomize comparative study carry . IVF/ICSI standard treatment infertility frequently require repeated treatment achieve live birth . The purpose study determine improve sperm parameter cause prior treatment varicocele result improvement overall pregnancy/birth rate IVF/ICSI result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A varicocele abnormal dilation pampiniform plexus cause incompetence valve internal spermatic vein . Varicocele prevalence 10-15 % general population common cause male infertility , present 30-35 % men primary , 69-81 % men secondary infertility . There one approach treatment varicocele associate MFI One common approach treat assist reproductive technique ( ART ) . Patients total motile sperm count &lt; 10 million sperm usually treat IVF without ICSI . Fertilization oocytes may accomplish isolate even single adequate spermatozoon laboratory bypass majority semen quality inadequacy male factor infertility . The result treatment use fresh embryos maternal age &lt; 35 46 % pregnancy 40 % live birth per cycle . Alternatively , varicocele associate MFI treat repair varicocele improve sperm quality . Occlusion spermatic vein surgical radiological method commonly perform circumstance improve fertility . A large body literature exist demonstrate post-treatment improvement semen parameter sperm DNA quality well improve spontaneous pregnancy rate compare treatment . There also study demonstrate improved result ART varicocele repair . Both approach advocate . ART often provide relatively quick result know excellent track record pregnancy live birth rate . Unfortunately , technique without risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome procedural complication . Multiple pregnancy common increase risk premature labour low birth weight . In addition treatment expensive multiple treatment increase financial burden health care system . Varicocele occlusion minor procedure . If perform radiologically , often immediate return normal activity . The complication rate low , mostly due radiological contrast medium allergy . Modern equipment careful technique enable procedure complete low radiation dose well level proven adverse biological effect . If varicocele repair demonstrate improve pregnancy outcome varicocele relate MFI spontaneous pregnancy improve pregnancy live birth rate per ART implantation , compel health care economic reason incorporate initial treatment . At present well construct randomize trial compare outcomes two approach .</detailed_description>
