	<brief_title>Use Topical Liquid Diclofenac Following Laser Microporation Cutaneous Neurofibromas Patients With NF1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome highly variable clinical manifestation worldwide incidence approximately 1/2500 . The common lesion cutaneous neurofibroma , appear skin 90 % adult NF1 . The number cutaneous neurofibromas affect individual vary several thousand . These lesion may surgically remove , typically recur , surgical removal often lead scar . Intralesional administration diclofenac previously report favorable result , significant inflammatory process observe within treated neurofibroma , tissue necrosis detachment treat neurofibromas , effect observe among control neurofibroma . The primary objective study evaluate use topical diclofenac treatment cutaneous neurofibromas patient NF1 . The secondary objective study ass safety use topical diclofenac treatment cutaneous neurofibromas patient NF1 . This open , control , prospective , proof-of-concept study , 7 patient present NF1 cutaneous neurofibromas . This study include three treatment visit study center three follow-up visit . Treatment consist two stage : neurofibroma microporation use laser device , follow topical application one drop diclofenac 25mg/ml surface neurofibroma ; follow re-application one drop diclofenac , twice daily , three day . The application subsequent first application perform patient . Subjects return study center three day interval ( Assessments 2 &amp; 3 ) new microporation topical diclofenac application , follow at-home topical diclofenac application three day . Assessment 4 take place 3 day Assessment 3 . Assessment 5 take place 7 day end treatment period Assessment 6 30 day last application study drug . The primary efficacy variable study inflammatory process presence tissue necrosis . The primary safety variable occurrence adverse event consider associated study drug , occur treatment period . Prior study-related procedure , write informed consent obtain participant . The Clinical Research From fill , store , cod , data analyze use GraphPad Prism , v. 5.0 . Frequency table generate central tendency calculate ( mean , median , mode ) .</detailed_description>
