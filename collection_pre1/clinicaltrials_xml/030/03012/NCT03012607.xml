	<brief_summary>Adherence antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) critical success HIV treatment therapeutic prevention . No accurate , objective point-of-care test available monitor adherence either ART PrEP . The inability accurately identify poorly adherent patient lead HIV infection ( failed PrEP non-suppressive ART ) , drug-resistant virus ( select fail ART ) , unnecessary switch costly second- third-line ART ( first-line regimen virologic efficacy non-adherence stop inappropriately ) . To address critical knowledge gap , investigator develop novel point-of-care test detect presence tenofovir—the common drug ART PrEP treatment worldwide—in fingerprick blood urine objective measure ART PrEP adherence . Our central hypothesis pharmacokinetics tenofovir blood urine support point-of-care tenofovir detection objective measure adherence , point-of-care tenofovir assay ability discriminate different drug adherence level . The investigator test central hypothesis pursue follow two specific aim : ( 1 ) To assess novel point-of-care tenofovir ( TFV ) assay whole blood urine specimen within control pharmacokinetic study HIV-negative adult receive tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) low , moderate , perfect adherence ; ( 2 ) To validate novel point-of-care tenofovir ( TFV ) assay blood urine specimens use exist biorepository real-world clinical HIV prevention study . This work innovative develops entirely new category rapid diagnostic test monitor ART PrEP adherence clinical point care . Our rapid assay help clinician identify patient need adherence counseling , implement prevent HIV acquisition , emergence drug resistant virus , unnecessary ART regimen switching—measures improve national HIV program help preserve global supply effective HIV medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives Study Primary Objective : • To determine pharmacokinetics tenofovir ( TFV ) blood , urine plasma adult perfect , median low adherence tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) . Secondary Objectives - To determine rate tenofovir washout blood , plasma urine among participant various level TDF adherence . - To determine steady-state concentration TFV blood plasma among controlled level TDF adherence . - To compare agreement TFV blood , plasma urine concentration . - To determine intracellular tenofovir-diphosphate ( TFV-DP ) trough concentration peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) dry blood spot ( DBS ) sample adult perfect , median low drug adherence . - To identify possible concentration threshold clinical interpretation binary point-of-care adherence test measurement TFV ( and/or TFV-DP ) relation adherence TDF . Design : The study design randomize , open-label pharmacokinetic study healthy adult volunteer . The study involve collection clinical data biological specimen , subject provide write informed consent participate . Healthy adult volunteer ( HIV serology hepatitis B surface Ag negative ) enrol . Once write consent obtain , screen visit perform . The study team obtain participant 's phone number , address , relevant contact information . Screening Visit : Participant screening perform within 14 day enrollment . A detailed background demographic health questionnaire administer . Ten mL blood drawn baseline assessment : complete blood count , HIV antibody test , Hepatitis B surface Ag testing , renal liver function test storage blood biorepository . The blood chemistry test use exclude subject abnormal laboratory test among neutrophil count , hemoglobin , platelet , AST , ALT . An abnormal test define Grade ≥3 DAIDS Table Grading Severity Adult Pediatric Adverse Events , Version 2.0 Nov. 2014 ) . The result clinical examination baseline laboratory assessment review inclusion/exclusion criterion . Entry : All entry visit begin Monday morning . After receive in-depth information study schedule , subject meet inclusion criterion enrol randomize ( 1:1:1 ) one 3 group receive control number dos Truvada® ( Gilead Sciences Inc. ) , contain tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF , 300 mg ) emtricitabine ( FTC , 200 mg ) 6 week . The participant carefully explain drug-dosing schedule , visit schedule potential medication side effect . We enroll total 30 adult evaluable PK sample ( 10 per group ) . All participant start TDF morning Entry visit . The 6-week treatment period choose order ensure concentration tenofovir different matrix ( i.e . blood , plasma , urine , PBMCs ) mimic expect condition patient chronic dose perfect , median low drug adherence . The blood/urine sample schedule base report tenofovir plasma half-life result previous PK study . Tenofovir concentration determine participant three study phase ( 1 ) lead-in period , ( 2 ) intensive PK sampling , ( 3 ) wash-out period . Phase 1 : Lead-in Period ( Entry 6 week ) Visit Prior 2nd Dose : Immediately prior second dose ( i.e . Group 1 : 24 post-dose ( Day # 2 ; Tuesday Morning ) ; Group 2 : 48 hour post-dose ( Day # 3 ; Wednesday Morning ) ; Group 3 ; 72 hour post-dose ( Day # 4 ; Thursday Morning ) subject return hospital . A single blood sample drawn ( 5 mL ) . From venous blood sample , 5 dry blood spot ( 50 µL/spot ) prepare Whatman 903 filter paper card . The remain blood centrifuge plasma store . A single fingerstick whole blood sample collect second Whatman 903 filter paper card 2 dry blood spot ( 50 µL/spot ) prepare . A separate 10 mL blood drawn take collect PBMCs determination intracellular tenofovir-DP concentration . Finally , spot urine sample collect ( 5-10 mL ) . All sample store -70°C -80°C . Weeks 3 5 ( Monday morning , pre-dose ) : A single blood sample drawn ( 5 mL ) prior dose administration . From venous blood sample , 5 dry blood spot ( 50 µL/spot ) prepare Whatman 903 filter paper card . The remain blood centrifuge plasma store . A single fingerstick whole blood sample collect 2 dried blood spot ( 50 µL/spot ) prepare second Whatman 903 filter paper card . A separate 10 mL blood drawn take collect PBMCs determination intracellular tenofovir-DP concentration . Finally , spot urine sample collect ( 5-10 mL ) . All sample store -70°C -80°C . Renal liver function test perform . Phase 2 : Intensive PK sampling ( start Monday morning Week 7 24 hour ) Week 7 Intensive PK visit : On Monday morning Week 7 , subject return hospital early morning . A medical officer conduct physical examination blood drawn laboratory safety evaluation ( AST , ALT ) . Following normal morning daily schedule drug intake , pre-dose blood sample drawn single Truvada® tablet administer empty stomach ( least 6 hour fast beforehand ) . This last dose Truvada® subject . Venous blood ( 3 mL/time point ) collect 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 hour post-dose . At time point , venous blood DBS ( 5 spot ) fingerstick ( 2 spot ) collect . Renal liver function test perform . Urine sample collect pre-dose interval 0-4 hour , 4-8 hour , 8-12 hour , 12-24 hour . Subjects additional 10 mL blood draw pre-dose PBMCs collect stored -70°C -80°C . After 24 hour , participant discharge hospital . The subject ask collect urine next study visit 24 hour . Phase 3 : Wash-out PK sampling ( Weeks 7 Week 10 ) Week 7 ( Wednesday Saturday ) : After intensive PK sample complete , participant return clinic day next 4 day ( i.e .
