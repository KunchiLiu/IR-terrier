	<detailed_description>Surgical resection main treatment potentially curable solid tumor . However , unavoidable tumor cell disseminate circulatory lymphatic system surgery . And quite number patient develop tumor metastasis and/or recurrence surgery , associate poor long-term outcome . The development tumor recurrence and/or metastasis surgery mostly dependent balance anti-tumor immune function human body ability implantation , proliferation neovascularization tumor cell . Multiple surgical factor may influence balance anti-tumor immune function tumor recurrence . For example , presence primary tumor inhibits angiogenesis , whereas tumor resection eliminate safeguard angiogenesis ; surgical manipulation release tumor cell circulation ; surgical response inhibit natural killer ( NK ) cell activity promote development tumor metastasis ; local systemic release growth factor surgery may also promote tumor recurrence locally distant site . Furthermore , study show general anaesthetic technique drug may influence cellular immune function long-term outcome . For example , find ketamine thiopental , propofol , suppress NK cell activity ; three drug cause significant reduction NK cell number ; isoflurane halothane inhibit interferon ( IFN ) stimulation NK cell cytotoxicity ; nitrous oxide interferes DNA , purine , thymidylate synthesis depresses neutrophil chemotaxis ; opioids show suppress cell-mediated humoral immunity . Considering potential harmful effect general anesthesia/anesthetics , increase interest effect regional anaesthesia . Retrospective study investigate relationship epidural anesthesia outcome cancer surgery give different result . In meta-analysis , regional anesthesia associate increase survival rate ( HR = 0.84 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.74-0.96 , P = 0.013 ) , effect rate tumor recurrence/metastasis ( HR = 0.88 , 95 % Cl 0.64-1.22 , P = 0.457 ) . The investigator hypothesize epidural anesthesia may produce favorable effect long-term outcome elderly patient schedule major cancer surgery general anesthesia . However , sufficient evidence aspect .</detailed_description>
