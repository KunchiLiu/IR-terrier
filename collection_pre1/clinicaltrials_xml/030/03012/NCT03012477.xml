	<brief_title>CISPLATIN + AZD-1775 In Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve AZD1775 treatment type cancer . Cisplatin FDA approve cancer show active treatment breast cancer . AZD1775 drug design block protein call Wee-1 may control ability certain cancer cell grow divide . Cisplatin work damage DNA inside cancer cell prevent divide . By combine AZD1775 Cisplatin , cancer cell may potentially effectively kill . In research study , investigator look determine whether combination AZD1775 cisplatin effective treatment triple negative breast cancer spread part body .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically cytologically confirm invasive breast cancer , stage IV disease . Patients without pathologic cytologic confirmation metastatic disease unequivocal evidence metastasis physical examination radiologic evaluation . Either primary invasive tumor and/or metastasis must triplenegative , define : hormonereceptor poor , ER PRnegative , stain present &lt; 1 % immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) HER2negative : 0 1+ IHC , FISH &lt; 2.0 Participants must least one lesion within previously radiate field measurable computerized tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan per RECIST version 1.1 . Bone lesion consider measurable definition . See Section 11 evaluation measurable disease . Prior chemotherapy : Patients may receive 01 prior chemotherapeutic regimen metastatic breast cancer must treatment chemotherapy least 21 day enrollment study . The number patient 0 prior chemotherapeutic regimen limit maximum n = 20 . Prior biologic therapy : Patients must discontinue biologic therapy least 21 day participation . Prior radiation therapy : Patients may receive prior radiation therapy either metastatic earlystage set . Radiation therapy must complete least 14 day prior study participation patient recover adverse effect radiation grade ≤1 . Age ≥18 ECOG performance status ≤1 Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm3 Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL OR measure creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥45 mL/min calculate CockcroftGault method OR 24hour measure urine CrCl ≥45mL/min Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal . For patient document liver metastasis , AST/ALT ≤ 5.0 time upper limit normal . Patients bisphosphonates may continue receive bisphosphonate therapy study treatment . Availability tissue block initial breast cancer diagnosis and/or metastatic recurrence . If tissue block available , 1020 unstained slide may provide alternative . If unstained slide provide , send specifically request DFCI study coordinator . If archival tumor tissue available , fresh biopsy may perform . In first stage trial , least 10 patient biopsyaccessible disease must willing undergo pair research biopsy . These biopsy occur 548 hour C1D1 cisplatin dose ( ie . C1D2or C1D3 ) 58hrs ( +/ 24hrs ) last dose AZD1775 C2D3 . The exact timing biopsy relative receipt study treatment accurately record . Biopsies may do local anesthesia intravenous conscious sedation , accord standard institutional guideline . Research biopsies require general anesthesia allow protocol unless biopsy obtain simultaneously clinical reason , judgment patient ' treat physician . Patients undergo attempted ontreatment research biopsy inadequate tissue obtain still eligible continue protocol therapy . They require undergo repeat biopsy attempt . If dose delay place biopsy outside allowable window , biopsy reschedule within window . If feasible , biopsy obtain close within window possible . Fine needle aspirate ( FNA ) allow Female subject childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test screening . The effect AZD1775 develop human fetus unknown . Women childbearing potential men must agree use enhance method contraception . All woman consider childbearing potential unless fulfill one follow criterion screen : Postmenopausal define age ≥50 amenorrheic least 12 month OR Women age &lt; 50 amenorrheic least 12 month serum folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) luteinizing hormone ( LH ) level postmenopausal range ( per institutional standard ) . If woman documentation irreversible surgical sterilisation hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral salpingectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , consider postmenopausal . Appropriate contraception use time screening , throughout duration study participation , four month last dose AZD1775 . Acceptable method contraception include abstinence , tubal ligation , intrauterine device , vasectomise partner . All method contraception ( exception total abstinence ) use combination use condom male sexual partner intercourse . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , participant treat physician inform immediately . Additionally , male patient refrain donate sperm start dose 6 month discontinue AZD1775 . If male patient wish father child advise arrange freeze sperm sample prior start study treatment . Participant must able swallow pill . Participant may percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube receive total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants receive investigational agent within 21 day first dose study drug . Major surgical procedure &lt; 28 day begin study treatment . Participants receive prior inhibitor Wee1 kinase activity Participants receive prior platinum chemotherapy Known brain metastasis untreated , symptomatic , require therapy control symptom . Patients history treated central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases eligible . Treated brain metastasis define evidence progression ≥ 1 month treatment , hemorrhage ≥ 2 week treatment ongoing requirement corticosteroid , ascertain clinical examination brain imaging ( magnetic resonance image CT scan ) screening period . Any corticosteroid use brain metastasis must discontinue without subsequent appearance symptom ≥2 week first study drug . Treatment brain metastasis may include whole brain radiotherapy , radiosurgery , combination deem appropriate treating physician . Patients CNS metastasis treat neurosurgical resection brain biopsy perform within 1 month day 1 study treatment exclude . Patients grade &gt; 1 neuropathy grade &gt; 1 toxicity ( except alopecia anorexia ) prior therapy History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition AZD1775 Cisplatin . Participants receive medication , substance , food ( ie , grapefruit juice ) list ineligible ( Please refer Section 5.4 list restrict comedications ) : prescription nonprescription drug product know sensitive CYP3A4 substrates CYP3A4 substrate narrow therapeutic index , moderate strong inhibitors/inducers CYP3A4 discontinue 2 week prior Day 1 dose withheld throughout study 2 week last dose study drug . sensitive substrate CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , substrates enzyme narrow therapeutic range inhibitor substrates Pgp Participants uncontrolled intercurrent illness , include , limited , ongoing active infection , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , congestive heart failureNew York Heart Association Class III IV ( Appendix B ) , active ischemic heart disease , myocardial infarction within previous six month , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , gastric duodenal ulceration diagnose within previous 6 month , chronic liver renal disease , severe malnutrition . In addition , patient ineligible psychiatric illness social situation could limit ability comply study requirement . Participants refractory nausea vomiting , chronic gastrointestinal disease , previous significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption AZD1775 . Pregnant woman exclude study AZD1775 Wee1 inhibitor agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Lactating breastfeed woman exclude unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother AZD1775 , breastfeed discontinue prior treat AZD1775 . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Known HIVpositive participant ineligible participant increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Participant mean resting correct QT interval ( specifically QTc calculate use Fridericia formula [ QTcF ] ) &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 470 msec female , 3 electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) perform within 25 minute apart study entry , congenital long QT syndrome .</criteria>
