	<brief_summary>The purpose research study investigate role chemical reaction , inflammation oxidation , cause cardiac dysfunction ( heart function properly ) . The investigator interested study various chemical pathway cell damage determine prevalent and/or important . The investigator also want determine whether waste product oxidative damage chemical monitor blood urine serve indication existence severity overall heart disease activity . The investigator want determine whether certain protein , call enzyme , affect cell damage , whether presence absence certain gene create different form enzymes correlate development heart failure cardiomyopathy ( weaken heart muscle change heart muscle structure ) cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-center study conduct Cleveland Clinic . The target population study broad go beyond specific cohort community . Participants mainly recruit great Cleveland/Akron area , volunteer meeting inclusion/exclusion criterion eligible participation . The overall goal Cleveland Heart And Metabolic Prevention Study ( CHAMPS ) determine role nitrative stress development progression heart failure ( HF ) leave ventricular systolic dysfunction ( LVSD ) . The investigator previously develop perform preliminary clinical validation study multiple specific molecular footprint know pathway nitric oxide ( NO ) pathobiology affect substrate availability NO production generation NO-derived oxidant result nitrative stress . For molecular marker index , mechanistic link cardiovascular disease demonstrate . However , process may differentially express different proportion different stage LVSD/HF disease progression , certainly may vary among different individual . It investigators ' hypothesis interplay many process contribute development subclinical myocardial dysfunction ( SMD ) , progression overt LVSD HF . In order help determine role nitrative stress development progression heart failure leave ventricular systolic dysfunction study participant receive many non-invasive , research , procedures well blood draw urine collection . The procedure perform may include electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , echocardiogram , carotid intima-medial thickness measurement , ankle-brachial index , bioelectrical impedance analysis , pulse wave velocity analysis , spirometry , exhale nitric oxide analysis , venous occlusion strain-gauge plethysmography . The specific test perform participant description primary investigator participant receive test . All participant blood urine collection participant ask fill questionnaire pertain family history , personal medical history estimate functional capacity . Specific aim include : Aim 1 : To test hypothesis level specific nitric oxide ( NO ) -mediated process associate presence SMD LVSD/HF . Aim 2 : To test hypothesis level specific NO-mediated process associate prospective risk development adverse cardiovascular event overt HF stable patient without LVSD/HF baseline .</detailed_description>
