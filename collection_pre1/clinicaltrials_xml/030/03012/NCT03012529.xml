	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine rifampin , antibiotic ( medicine treat infection ) , effective treating osteomyelitis ( infection bone ) foot diabetic patient . Despite use powerful antibiotic prescribe long period time , many diabetic patient remain high risk need amputation part foot lower leg osteomyelitis cure . Some small research study show addition rifampin antibiotic effective treat osteomyelitis diabetic non-diabetics . However , diabetic osteomyelitis study , definite proof well usual treatment diabetic patient . If study find add rifampin usual antibiotic prescribe osteomyelitis reduces risk amputation , doctor able effectively treat many Veteran patient serious infection . Improving treatment outcome important healthcare goal VA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Rifampin Reduce Pedal Amputations Osteomyelitis Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , investigation six week course adjunctive rifampin vs. adjunctive match placebo ( riboflavin ) add backbone antibacterial therapy treatment diabetic foot osteomyelitis . Backbone antibacterial therapy single multiple agent select clinical treatment team base either culture result standard empiric therapy , administer either intravenously orally . Rifampin dose 600 mg daily . The primary outcome measure amputation-free survival . Amputation event include below- above-ankle amputation . Primary outcome determine systematic medical record review confirmatory research visit , phone call , need , information non-VA provider . The result amputation-free survival analyze mean two-sided log-rank test . The secondary outcome complete wound epithelialization remission osteomyelitis determine direct examination site investigator . The study initially enroll randomize total 880 study participant receive either rifampin placebo ( riboflavin ) addition backbone antibiotic therapy prescribe clinician . Investigators expect enroll , average , close one subject per month per site ( 10-12 per year/site ) 28 VA medical center achieve total randomization 880 subject three year . In meet average site enrollment projection , Investigators anticipate variation enrollment large small site , high-performing low-performing site . Subjects follow end second year randomization study primary endpoint event ( amputation death ) occur . On average , study participant follow 1.8 year systematic review medical record , study visit phone call .</detailed_description>
