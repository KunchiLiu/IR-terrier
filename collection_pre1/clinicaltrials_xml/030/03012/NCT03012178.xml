	<detailed_description>Mitral regurgitation common disease lead heart failure death leave untreated . The known therapy mitral regurgitation correction mitral valve , commonly perform surgical repair replacement . According STS database , 15,748 lone mitral valve surgery 2014 . The number mitral valve surgery increase 23 % increase year 2010 2014 . Based ACC/AHA guideline management mitral valve disease , quantify severity mitral regurgitation central determine patient appropriate correction mitral valve surgery . Specifically , diagnosis severe MR make , patient consider appropriate mitral valve surgery almost clinical circumstance . However , significant mortality morbidity associate mitral valve surgery . In STS database , 30 day mortality ~2 % repair ~5 % replacement . This data take account long-term mortality morbidity re-operation life-long anti-coagulation well change quality life . The common diagnostic tool ass severity MR echocardiography . Several study show echocardiography parameter use quantify qualify MR high inter-observer intra-observer variability , call accuracy parameter question . Furthermore , study show significant degree discordance echocardiography MRI assess MR , particularly among patient refer mitral valve surgery . In recent study , quantification mitral regurgitant volume MRI find accurate echocardiography patient underwent mitral valve surgery . All 38 patient underwent mitral valve surgery study deem appropriate accord ACC/AHA guideline base echocardiographic finding . However , 2/3rds patient underwent mitral valve surgery study severe MR MRI . Thus , propose prospective multicenter trial ass : 1 ) severity MR MRI patient undergo mitral valve surgery . 2 ) impact mitral valve surgery quality life healthcare cost context MR severity MRI , 3 ) ass patient outcome post surgery context MR severity MRI 4 ) likelihood valve replacement vs. repair accord MR severity MRI .</detailed_description>
