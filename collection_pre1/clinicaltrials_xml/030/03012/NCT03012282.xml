	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well compute tomography ( CT ) perfusion image work assess treatment response patient pancreatic cancer . Analyzing specific measurement CT perfusion image may help doctor good determine tumor respond chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may help guide treatment patient pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT Perfusion Images Assessing Treatment Response Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To develop , test , refine CT perfusion protocol feasibility , reproducibility , quality limit number patient pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDA ) . II . To analyze preliminary date regard perfusion parameter improve accuracy predict response resectability subset patient locally advance ( LA ) borderline resectable ( BR ) PDA treat neoadjuvant therapy . OUTLINE : Patients undergo CT perfusion sequence 30 second baseline standard care CT scan follow-up CT scan 2 possibly 4 month chemotherapy , 4-6 week radiation therapy , prior definitive surgery . After completion study , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
