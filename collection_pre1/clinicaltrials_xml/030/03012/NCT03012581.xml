	<detailed_description>The study plan enrol 250 patient total 20 50 patient assign cohort accord indication , follow : - Cohort 1 : Non-clear cell RCC - Cohort 2 : Rare head neck cancer - Cohort 3 : Rare skin cancer - Cohort 4 : MSI-nonCRC - Cohort 5 : Penile cancer The study use two-stage Bayesian enrichment design . The first stage treats patient different cohort investigational product identifies possibly sensitive indication . The second stage compare outcomes among subset patient identify cohort distinguish subpopulation patient may benefit treatment patient evidence efficacy .</detailed_description>
