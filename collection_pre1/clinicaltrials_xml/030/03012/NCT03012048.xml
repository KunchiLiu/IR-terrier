	<brief_title>Effectiveness Point-of-use Water Treatment Technologies Prevent Stunting Among Children South Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lack access safe water low-resource setting likely contributes stunt growth early life , affect quarter child 5 year worldwide . Point-of-use water treatment technology potential provide effective low-cost solution improve quality drinking water setting . One technology , silver-impregnated ceramic disk , continually disinfect water household water storage container diffuse silver water daily treatment 10 15 liter least six month . Silver-impregnated ceramic water filter another commercially available technology additionally remove pathogen mechanically . While technology prove highly effective treating water , unknown whether use technology translate improvement child health outcome . This community-based intervention trial estimate effect silver-impregnated ceramic disk silver-impregnated ceramic water filter linear growth child Limpopo , South Africa . Households Dzimauli community randomize receive ceramic disk , water filter , safe-storage water container alone , intervention . Children follow every three month 2 year assess height , weight , pathogen burden stool sample . Cognitive assessment complete 2 , 5 , 7 year follow-up . The investigator hypothesize child household give ceramic disk water filter show improve linear growth compare household without intervention . The investigator expect ceramic disk perform similarly water filter result similar improvement linear growth compare child control household . Estimates effectiveness demonstrate trial provide necessary evidence base support scale-up manufacturing distribution ceramic disk filter , could provide robust point-of-use water treatment solution rural area . By help identify effective tool reduce risk stunt child , trial contribute target improve child health low-resource setting .</detailed_description>
