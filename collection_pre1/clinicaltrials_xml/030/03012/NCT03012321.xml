Histological cytological proof prostate adenocarcinoma ( Note : smallcell carcinoma prostate permit ) Documented progressive mCRPC base least one follow criterion : 1 . PSA progression define 25 % increase baseline value increase absolute value least 2.0 ng/mL confirm another PSA level minimum 1 week interval minimum PSA 2.0 ng/mL . 2 . Progression bidimensionally measurable soft tissue nodal metastasis assess within one month prior registration CT scan MRI . 3 . Progression bone disease ( evaluable disease ) ( new bone lesion ( ) ) bone scan . Agree undergo biopsy least one metastatic site determine DNA repair defect . However : 1 . Adequate metastatic tissue prior metastatic disease biopsy/resection use available lieu biopsy . These patient eligible protocol therapy biopsy tumor positive DNA repair defect . 2 . Patients know DNA damage repair defect base prior appropriately validate metastatic disease analysis may use lieu new biopsy/analysis base central site evaluation quality biopsy analysis . 3 . Patients know germline DNA repair defect eligible without biopsy . However highly desirable undergo metastatic disease biopsy well define scope DNA repair defect current disease context . ECOG status 02 ( Appendix A : Performance Status Criteria ) . Adequate organ function define obtain within 14 day registration : ANC &gt; = 1500/µl Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL WBC &gt; 3x10^9/L Platelet count 100,000/µl Creatinine ≥51 mL/min estimate use CockcroftGault equation Potassium ≥ 3.5 mmol/L ( within institutional normal range ) Bilirubin within normal institutional limit ( &lt; 2X upper limit normal ( ULN ) Gilbert 's disease ) AST ( SGOT ) / ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 1.5x institutional ULN unless liver metastasis present case must ≤ 5x ULN The effect abiraterone , olaparib combination develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . Men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry , duration study participation least 3 month thereafter . Patients must discontinue antiandrogen therapy ( i.e. , flutamide , bicalutamide , nilutamide ) least 4 week prior registration evidence fall PSA washout . Serum testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL . Patients must continue primary ADT LHRH analogue ( agonist antagonist ) undergone orchiectomy . Able take oral medication without crush , dissolve chew tablet . Patients must life expectancy ≥ 6 month . Patients may receive prior radiation therapy surgery . However , least 14 day must elapse since completion radiation therapy surgery patient must recover side effect time registration ( e.g . back baseline grade 1 ) . Patient willing able comply protocol duration study include undergoing treatment schedule visit examination include follow . Prior exposure CYP17 ( ketoconazole ) PARP inhibitor prostate cancer . Patients prior exposure ketoconazole eligible . Prior chemotherapy castration resistant disease . Chemotherapy give hormonesensitive set permissible stop least 4 week prior registration . Note : Patients receive stable dose bisphosphonates bone metastasis , include zoledronic acid , denosumab study deem appropriate treating physician . Prior exposure enzalutamide , ARN509 investigational ARdirected therapy set mCRPC . Patients currently active second malignancy exclude nonmelanomatous skin cancer superficial transitional cell carcinoma . Note : Patients consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy consider without evidence disease 1 year . Patients receive investigational agent . Any prior investigational agent must stop least 14 day ( 2 week washout ) prior registration . Patients receive itraconazole , ketoconazole , fluconazole within 3 week prior registration recover ( i.e. , back baseline Grade 1 ) AEs due agent administer 3 week earlier . Patients history active seizure ( single confirm seizure event ) last 2 year time registration . Patients history pituitary adrenal dysfunction active symptomatic viral hepatitis chronic liver disease eligible . Patients active brain metastasis . A scan confirm absence brain metastasis require asymptomatic patient . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition olaparib abiraterone . Patients consider poor medical risk due serious , uncontrolled medical disorder , nonmalignant systemic disease active , uncontrolled infection . Examples include , limited , uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , recent ( within 3 month ) myocardial infarction , unstable spinal cord compression ( untreated unstable within least 28 day prior registration ) , superior vena cava syndrome , extensive bilateral lung disease HRCT scan psychiatric disorder prohibits obtain informed consent . Patients prolong preexist hematological toxicity include known indicator bone marrow failure abnormality . Patients myelodysplastic syndrome / acute myeloid leukemia . Patients may continue daily MultiVitamin , calcium Vitamin D , herbal , alternative food supplement ( i.e . PCSpes , Saw Palmetto , St John 's Wort , etc . ) must discontinue registration . Hormonalacting agent DES forbid trial must stop prior registration . No washout period require . Patients megesterol acetate hot flash allow continue therapy . Patients must stop take ritonavir , idinavir , saquinavir , telithromycin , clarithromycin nelfinavir 1 week prior registration . Note : topical ketoconazole permit . Patients must stop take phenytoin , rifampicin , rifapentine , rifabutin , carbamazepine , nevirapine , modafinil St John 's Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) 3 week prior registration .

Patients must plan receive concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy , surgery radiation therapy protocol treatment . Use prohibit concomitant medication within 7 day registration . Patients HIVpositive combination antiretroviral therapy potential pharmacokinetic interaction olaparib . In addition patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrow suppressive therapy . Patients know active Hepatitis B Hepatitis C. Patients baseline moderate severe hepatic impairment ( ChildPugh Class B C ) . Persistent toxicity ( ≥CTCAE Grade 2 ) , exception alopecia , cause previous cancer therapy . Resting ECG QTc &gt; 470msec 2 time point within 24 hour period long QT syndrome .
