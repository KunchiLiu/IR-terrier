	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well ixazomib citrate , lenalidomide , dexamethasone , daratumumab work treat patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma . Ixazomib citrate may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , lenalidomide dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , daratumumab , may block cancer growth different way target certain cell . Giving ixazomib citrate , lenalidomide , dexamethasone , daratumumab may work well treat patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine complete response rate ( CR ) four-drug combination ixazomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone daratumumab patient previously untreated symptomatic multiple myeloma ( MM ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) , good partial response ( VGPR ) rate four drug combination ixazomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone daratumumab , use initial therapy patient previously untreated symptomatic MM . II . To determine progression free survival overall survival among patient previously untreated symptomatic MM follow treatment four drug combination Ixazomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone daratumumab follow ixazomib daratumumab maintenance till progression . II . To determine toxicity associate four drug combination ixazomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone daratumumab patient previously untreated symptomatic MM . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine proportion minimal residual disease ( MRD ) negativity follow induction therapy four-drug combination ixazomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone daratumumab . II . To assess quality life use patient complete Functional Assessment Cancer Treatment ( FACT ) /Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) questionnaires . OUTLINE : INDUCTION PHASE : Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 lenalidomide PO day 1-21 . Patients receive daratumumab intravenously ( IV ) 3-7 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 course 1 2 , day 1 15 course 3 , 4 , 5 , day 1 course 7 beyond . Patients also receive dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE PHASE : Patients receive ixazomib citrate PO day 1 , 8 , 15 daratumumab IV 3-7 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 28 day 36 month registration absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 6 month .</detailed_description>
