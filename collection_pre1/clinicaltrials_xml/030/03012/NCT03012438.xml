	<brief_summary>During surgery thyroid remove ( thyroidectomy ) , identification parathyroid gland , save , challenge . Therefore , need accurate intraoperative guidance . Earlier animal study show parathyroid gland identify use Near Infrared Fluorescent dye Indocyanine green ( ICG ) . Our hypothesis therefore , use ICG-based fluorescence image thyroid surgery provide real-time intraoperative visualization parathyroid glands . This prospective observational feasibility study aim evaluate feasibility use ICG identify parathyroid gland thyroid surgery . 30 patient ( age &gt; 18 year ) already regularly schedule thyroid surgery ; i.e . patient undergoing total thyroidectomy suitable inclusion . In patient , undergoing total thyroidectomy infrared fluorescence imaging , use per-operative intravenous injection 7.5 mg ICG , test feasibility image characteristic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NIRF Parathyroid Visualization : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , feasibility use NIR fluorescence image identification parathyroid glands thyroid surgery explore . Per-operatively : The surgery start usual . When surgeon would normally search parathyroid gland , 7.5 mg ICG administer intravenously infusion patient arm . An intravenous administration choose minimal invasive nature result describe early case series ICG also administer via peripheral infusion . Directly , fluorescence system switch fluorescence mode . The surgeon determine whether parathyroid gland visible . If need , due washout , second dose 7.5 mg ICG administer . After identification parathyroid gland , surgery continue standard situation , desire visualize parathyroid gland , another dose ICG give . Time first identification parathyroid glands total surgical time measure . After complete removal thyroid , another 7.5 mg ICG administer intravenously visualize vascularization parathyroid gland . The intensity subjectively score : 1 parathyroid black injection ICG , 2 partially vascularize , 3 parathyroid green ; well vascularized . The fluorescence system use record whole procedure . Directly procedure researcher ask surgeon whether think technique feasible . Postoperatively : As standard care , thyroid surgery , serum calcium level determine . Low calcium level indicate misidentification parathyroid gland . These calcium level determine patient total thyroidectomy day 1 , 2 two week . Also TSH determine two week standard care . The thyroid specimen send pathology . In specimen , pathologist search parathyroid gland , standard care . Furthermore , video recording analyze , quantify fluorescence signal compare background : measuring Target Background Ratio . Also , video recording time visualization parathyroid gland reassessed independent expert .</detailed_description>
