	<brief_title>Laser Assisted Drug Delivery Treatment Superficial Non Melanoma Skin Cancer : Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma ( sBCC ) Bowen Disease ( BD ) malignant skin tumor localise superficial epidermis . These tumor highly prevalent caucasian population . Diagnosis sBCC BD often delay clinical manifestation may discrete lesion sometimes wrongly diagnose treat eczema . Once diagnosis establish , lesion may cover extensive area , make surgical excision difficult . At moment , physician make use less invasive technique photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) . Pretreatment ablative carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) laser recently study order enhance skin penetration photosensitizer methyl aminolevulinate ( MAL ) . This study compare result full ablative fractional ablative CO2 laser mode pretreatment PDT management sBCC BD . Ablation upper epiderm cancer result deep penetration MAL . Fractional ablation know result well wound heal compare full ablative CO2 laser ablation , small skin column ablate instead entire epidermal layer . Patients non operable sBCC BD lesion cover area least 5 cm2 presence two small separate lesion , investigate . Lesions great 5 cm2 divide two . After randomization , half lesion pretreated full ablative CO2 laser , half fractional ablative CO2 laser . Afterwards , entire surface treat MAL-PDT . Such current clinical practice , treatment modality repeat two week interval . Thus , every subject undergoes treatment modality , make within-patient comparison possible . The endpoint efficacy , pain , aesthetic patient preference investigate twelve month follow .</detailed_description>
