	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect different surgical resection ( R0 , R1 , R2 ) circulate NET transcript ( PCR score NETest ) . A drop circulate NET level correlate surgical excision . Secondly , variation circulate NET transcript correlate NET recurrence test whether analysis may constitute early predictive marker disease relapse .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Biomarker-based tool accurately predict gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( GEP-NET ) treatment response tumor recurrence currently available . Circulating biomarkers associate GEP-NETs limited measurement plasma chromogranin A ( CgA ) . The investigator develop PCR-based tool quantitate ( score ) circulate GEP-NET molecular signature ( `` liquid '' biopsy ) high sensitivity specificity . This signature identify type GEP-NETs include small ( 1cm ) non-metastatic tumor , significantly reduce tumor debulking decrease follow surgical `` cure '' . Elevated post-surgical score associate tumor recurrence within 6 month ~40 % case . Current NET treatment protocol associate tumor recurrence ( progression free survival ) range 5-18 month . The majority patient experience relapse within 18 month irrespective treatment approach . The investigator hypothesize PCR measurement circulate NET mRNA accurately predict extent surgical resection ( tumor removal ) elevate score predict tumor relapse occur . This biomarker protocol seek test hypothesis evaluate whether change plasma CgA effective predict resection recurrence .</detailed_description>
