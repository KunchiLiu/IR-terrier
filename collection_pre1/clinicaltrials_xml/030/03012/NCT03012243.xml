	<brief_title>Bile Aspiration v Drain Acute Cholecystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Percutaneous cholecystostomy minimally invasive technique treatment cholecystitis . The cholecystostomy insert transhepatically transabdominally . The transhepatic route prefer due low risk bile leakage . The drainage decompress gallbladder drain bile . This decompression reduce inflammatory process gallbladder . Percutaneous cholecystostomy often applied patient fit emergency surgery need intervention due deterioration clinical status . However , even though cholecystostomy widely practise , fully evaluate . Percutaneous cholecystostomy high success rate , low procedure-related mortality 30 day mortality 15 % . Furthermore , recurrence rate within one year cholecystostomy report range 4 22 % . The time duration drainage differ different study range three six week . Optimal timing drainage study . Two week seem sufficient maturation tract transhepatic route 3 week transabdominal route . It suggest prolonged drainage duration associate increase risk recurrence inflammation due local irritation gallbladder mucosa drain . Percutaneous cholecystostomy often consider bridge surgery . However , less half patient treated PC treat cholecystectomy . This suggest treatment often choose group fit surgery often turn definitive treatment . Percutaneous gallbladder aspiration technique use purpose similar percutaneous cholecystostomy . This technique alternative may convenient percutaneous cholecystostomy . The aspiration perform small gauge needle ultrasound guidance without leave drain . The aspiration lead decompression gallbladder , facilitate recovery . However , described study need evaluation . One single aspiration may sufficient relief symptom majority patient , two aspiration perform success rate increase substantially . One randomize control trial present PC compare gallbladder aspiration . In trial PC superior gallbladder aspiration term effectiveness . In trail , however , one aspiration perform . No major complication occur either group minor complication equal group . In retrospective study compare aspiration PC find gallbladder aspiration safer PC comparable clinical outcome . It believe single decompression sufficient reduction intraluminal pressure . Only minority patient positive bile culture , indicate infection key mechanism development cholecystitis , indicate continuous drainage may necessary . As low rate complication report aspiration due usage small needle drain leave dislocate cause bile leakage fear complication PC . It suggest PC role salvage method aspiration successful . In order compare percutaneous cholecystostomy leave drain situ percutaneous gallbladder aspiration plan undertake double-blind randomized control trial .</detailed_description>
