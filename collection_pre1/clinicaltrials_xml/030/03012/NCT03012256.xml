	<brief_summary>Rationale : In Canada , home care client large expand subgroup medically complex old adult relatively poor access effective chronic disease management . They double emergency department utilization rate compare nursing home resident old population . The investigator previously publish case-finding tool ( Detection Indicators Vulnerabilities Emergency Room Trips ( DIVERT ) Scale ) recommend chronic disease management case-finding home care . The investigator recently conduct pilot trial Niagara , Canada , target , person-centered model supportive cardio-respiratory disease management . Objectives : The investigator evaluate cardio-respiratory disease management model home care manage symptom avoid emergency department use . A pan-Canadian , pragmatic cluster-randomized trial conduct collaboration trial investigator public home care provider ( i.e. , health region ) . The main objective evaluate effectiveness preliminary cost-effectiveness target , person-centered cardio-respiratory management model . The main question : P : Among home care client experience cardio-respiratory symptom ( objectively target use DIVERT Scale ) , I : guideline-based , feasible , multi-component/complex , cardio-respiratory management model , C : compare regular care , O : reduce cardio-respiratory symptom , reduce/postpone unplanned emergency department ( ED ) visit , reduce unplanned hospital use , improve patient activation , improve health-related quality life client , T : 6-month follow-up period baseline ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Context : Public home care service deliver least 6 % Canadians age 65-74 , 15 % age 75-84 32 % age 85 old . These client medically complex , access care across setting , high emergency department utilization rate , relatively poor access effective chronic disease management . Their frequent emergency department use align chronic disease management geriatric care principle . Effective chronic disease management model employ multiple component deliver coordinated multidisciplinary team . According 'chronic disease management model ' , home care play complementary function medical practitioner . Clinical self-care support well case management among effective component chronic disease management . Self-care education support show improve health outcome across chronic disease . Sustained follow-up nurse non-medical staff also effective . Canadian home care provider , historically focused delivery personal support service , start develop supportive chronic disease management capacity ( e.g . specialist nurse monitoring ) . However , trial exclude frail senior specific home care , leave little evidence inform chronic disease management practice . Previous Work : Effective chronic disease management home care limited insufficient target client need likely benefit . The investigator develop validated prognostic case-finding tool home care know Detection Indicators Vulnerabilities Emergency Room Trips ( DIVERT ) Scale recommend home care . It derive real time Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care ( RAI-HC ) standardize home care assessment use 9 Canadian province well Estonia , Finland , Hong Kong , Iceland , Ireland , Italy , Japan , Netherlands , New Zealand , Singapore , Spain , Switzerland , U.S. state . Cardio-respiratory symptom condition prominent predictive element DIVERT Scale . Based evidence-based guideline develop - part - investigator team , investigator pilot combined use DIVERT Scale multi-component cardio-respiratory management model . The pilot pragmatic cluster randomize trial include 200 client across six home care caseloads . The pilot recognize 2015 Ontario Minister 's Medal Honour Role Excellence Health Quality . OBJECTIVES The main objective evaluate effectiveness preliminary cost-effectiveness target , person-centered cardio-respiratory management model . Research question : 1 . Among home care client experience cardio-respiratory symptom ( objectively target use DIVERT Scale ) , guideline-based , feasible , multi-component/complex , cardio-respiratory management model , compare regular care , reduce/postpone unplanned emergency department ( ED ) visit , improve patient activation , reduce cardio-respiratory symptom , reduce unplanned hospital use , improve health-related quality life client , 6-month follow-up period baseline ? 2 . If effective , evidence cost-effectiveness ? METHODS Intervention : From evidence-based guideline develop - part - team , extensive client profiling , input clients/families well health professional , investigator develop person-centred , multi-component cardio-respiratory management model contain follow component : schedule nurse-led self-management support ( base training program , tool-kit ) , advance care goal planning , clinical pharmacist medication reconciliation , team case round , SBAR ( Situation , Background , Assessment Recommendation ) communication protocol primary care , standardize transition package . Each component specific objective within model , however manner deliver may adapt . The approach base evidence effective implementation field , include element 'person-centred care ' . Design : The investigator conduct pragmatic , cluster-randomized trial leverage secondary electronic patient record . Sixty ( 60 ) geographic area ( home care caseloads ) randomize use 1:2 ( intervention : control ) ratio . Population : Approximately 1,800 long-stay home care client live non-institutional set 60 distinct geographic home care caseloads Canada . Inclusion criterion : client DIVERT Scale target group ( 9,10 , 14 , 15 ) include ( i.e . least one cardio-respiratory symptom ( chest pain , dyspnea , dizziness , irregular pulse ) least one cardiac condition ( congestive heart failure coronary artery disease ) ) . The investigator utilize DIVERT Scale objective measure eligibility . Clients receive palliative care ( i.e. , prognosis le six month live , K8e Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care ( RAI-HC ) ) dialysis ( P2g RAI-HC ) baseline assessment exclude . Recruitment : Eligible client identify case manager regular home care enrollment reassessment use RAI-HC assessment ( standard practice ) 6 8 month . Eligible client automatically include intervention 'regular care ' control intent-to-treat basis . Each home care provider 's process attain consent intervention apply . Study inform consent seek give cardio-respiratory management model consider best practice care offer - whole part - full clinical discretion home care provider per exist practice . The cardio-respiratory management accept - whole part - full clinical discretion client per exist practice . Trial investigator part intervention pilot data collection , individual care decision-making , record management study period beyond provide guidance access resource . All trial data extract secondary data anonymized prior transmission home care provider staff . Outcomes Follow-up : Primary Outcomes : - Time first unplanned emergency department visit within 6 month baseline - Presence cardio-respiratory symptom 6-month follow-up - Cost home care service within 6 month baseline Secondary Outcomes : - Change patient activation ( base 13 item patient activation measure ) 6-month follow-up - Change health-related quality life ( base Minimum Data Set Health Status Index ) 6-month follow-up - Number unplanned emergency department visit per day risk ( alive , institutionalize ) within 6 month baseline - Number unplanned inpatient ( medical ) hospital day per day risk ( alive , institutionalize ) within 6 month baseline A 6-month follow-up use reflect time great risk among home care client . Sample calculations/Assumptions : Primary outcome : Time first unplanned emergency department visit within 6 month baseline ( alive , institutionalize ) . Ability detect hazard ratio 0.75 . Mean size home care caseload : 120 client Mean prevalence DIVERT target group caseload : 30 % Expected recruitment 6 month per caseload : 30 Mean cluster size : 30 Allocation : 1:2 ( intervention : control ) Simulations use retrospective secondary data source undertaken explore power hypothetical DIVERT-CARE trial conduct Hamilton-Niagara-Haldimand-Brant ( HNHB ) health region Ontario December 2014 June 2015 . The simulation find 60 HNHB home care caseloads randomize 1:2 intervention control ratio could expect enroll 1,809 patient across seven month . The simulation link patient actual emergency department utilization record , extend time first ED visit figure patient 20 randomly select intervention caseloads achieve hazard ratio 0.75 , figure choose conservative pilot study still clinically significant . The overall event rate 35.5 % intervention group 44.8 % control . The median time first visit 88 day intervention group 75 day control . The power simulate DIVERT trial 94.12 % two-sided alpha 0.05 . Simulations hazard ratio 0.80 yield power 79.96 % The intracluster correlation coefficient ( ICC ) estimate 0.005 . Main Analyses : The primary hypothesis assess multilevel discrete-time proportional hazard model . The dependent variable day first emergency department visit , censored date home care discharge reason . Caseload partner site include nested random effect . The hazard ratio , 95 % confidence interval , p-value report treatment group effect covariates applicable . A two-sided alpha level 0.05 use judge statistical significance . The economic evaluation examine total care cost , control length stay , treatment group compare incremental cost incremental effect ( i.e . cost per ED visit avert ) . The secondary hypothesis evaluate multilevel general linear model . Six-month change health-related quality life , number symptom , patient activation , number emergency department visit respective dependent variable . Caseload home care provider site include nested random effect . The unit change measure , 95 % confidence interval , p-value report treatment group effect covariates applicable . A two-sided alpha level 0.05 use judge statistical significance . Main Secondary Datasets : RAI-HC : The Resident Assessment Instrument Home Care ( RAI-HC ) standardize comprehensive assessment contain approximately 200 item , find document major domain health reliably .
