	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine , sargramostim , cyclophosphamide work treat patient triple negative breast cancer . Vaccines make person 's white blood cell mixed tumor protein may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine , sargramostim , cyclophosphamide may work well treat patient triple negative breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To show multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine ( folate receptor [ FR ] alpha peptide vaccine ) sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) adjuvant prolong disease-free survival ( DFS ) compare GM-CSF adjuvant treatment patient triple negative breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare safety tolerability metronomic cyclophosphamide follow FRalpha peptide vaccine GM-CSF versus GM-CSF alone . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether high level antibody cellular immune response toward FRalpha measure baseline prognostic factor vaccine immune response and/or cancer relapse . II . To determine whether level tumor expression FRalpha baseline prognosis factor vaccine immune response and/or cancer relapse . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive cyclophosphamide orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 15-21 course 1 . Starting course 2 , patient receive multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine sargramostim intradermally ( ID ) day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day course 2-7 every 6 month course 8-14 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive cyclophosphamide Arm I . Starting course 2 , patient receive multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine placebo ID day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day course 2-7 every 6 month course 8-14 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
