	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ruxolitinib phosphate give together pembrolizumab treat patient stage IV triple negative breast cancer spread place body . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving pembrolizumab ruxolitinib phosphate together may work well treat patient stage IV triple negative breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Ruxolitinib Phosphate Treating Patients With Metastatic Stage IV Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ruxolitinib phosphate ( ruxolitinib ) ( JAK2 inhibition ) combination fix dose pembrolizumab ( anti PD-1 ) patient advanced/metastatic triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety profile pembrolizumab combination ruxolitinib . II . To estimate clinical tumor response woman TNBC treat pembrolizumab combination ruxolitinib measure Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version ( v ) 1.1 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess tumor response immune relate ( ir ) RECIST association PDJ amplification , PD-L1 , PD-L2 , JAK2 pSTAT3 expression . II . To determine effect combination target blockade T- B- cell immunity breast cancer tumor antigen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ruxolitinib phosphate . Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 ruxolitinib phosphate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study , patient follow every 3 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
