	<brief_summary>This study conduct evaluate effect UMEC 62.5 microgram ( mcg ) UMEC 31.25 mcg lung function versus placebo 24 week treatment . This study provide important information regard efficacy safety UMEC administer separate inhaler subject background fluticasone furoate ( FF ) . This Phase IIb , randomize , double-blind , placebo control study compare efficacy , safety tolerability UMEC ( 62.5 mcg 31.25 mcg ) administer once-daily subject asthma well control . Eligible subject request participate study maximum approximately 31 week 4 phase ( pre screening , screening/run-in , randomization/treatment safety follow-up ) . The total number randomize subject require approximately 384 , 128 subject randomize 1:1:1 3 double-blind treatment arm .</brief_summary>

Dosing regimen ( twice daily equal total daily dose ) restrict current local product label . A best prebronchodilator morning FEV1 &lt; =85 % predict normal value . Predicted value base upon European Respiratory Society ( ERS ) Global Lung Function Initiative . A best postbronchodilator FEV1/ force vital capacity ( FVC ) &gt; =0.7 Visit 1 . Airway reversibility define &gt; =12 % &gt; =200 mL increase FEV1 20 60 minute follow 4 inhalation albuterol/salbutamol aerosol Visit 1 . Note : If subject meet reversibility criterion Visit 1 reversibility assessment may repeat within 7 day Visit 1 either criterion meet : The &gt; =9 % increase FEV1 20 60 minute follow 4 inhalation albuterol/salbutamol aerosol Visit 1 ; Documented evidence reversibility assessment within 1 year prior Visit 1 demonstrate postbronchodilator increase FEV1 &gt; =12 % &gt; =200 milliliter ( mL ) . Should subject successfully demonstrate airway reversibility ( define &gt; =12 % &gt; =200 mL increase FEV1 20 60 minute follow 4 inhalation albuterol/salbutamol aerosol ) second attempt , provide eligibility criterion assess Visit 1 meet , subject may enter 2week runin period . All subject must able replace current ShortActing Beta2Agonists ( SABA ) inhaler albuterol/salbutamol aerosol inhaler Visit 1 need duration study . Subjects must judge capable withhold albuterol/salbutamol least 6 hour prior study visit . Both male female subject eligible participate study . A female subject eligible participate pregnant , breastfeeding , least one follow condition applies : Not woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) WOCBP agree follow contraceptive guidance treatment period least 5 day last dose study treatment .

Current evidence pneumonia , pneumothorax , atelectasis , pulmonary fibrotic disease , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , chronic bronchitis , emphysema , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , lung cancer , respiratory abnormality asthma . Women pregnant lactate plan become pregnant study . Immune suppression ( e.g. , Human Immunodeficiency Virus [ HIV ] , Lupus ) risk factor pneumonia ( e.g. , neurological disorder affect control upper airway , Parkinson 's disease , Myasthenia Gravis ) . Subjects potentially high risk ( e.g. , low Body Mass Index [ BMI ] , severely malnourish , low FEV1 ) include discretion Investigator Subjects historical current evidence clinically significant cardiovascular , neurological , psychiatric , renal , hepatic , immunological , gastrointestinal , urogenital , nervous system , musculoskeletal , skin , sensory , endocrine ( include uncontrolled diabetes thyroid disease ) hematological abnormality uncontrolled . Significant define disease , opinion Investigator , would put safety subject risk participation , would affect efficacy safety analysis disease/condition exacerbate study . Unstable liver disease define presence ascites , encephalopathy , coagulopathy , hypoalbuminaemia , esophageal gastric varix persistent jaundice , cirrhosis , know biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Note : Chronic stable hepatitis B C acceptable subject otherwise meet entry criterion . Evidence clinically significant abnormality 12lead ECG perform screen runin . The Principal Investigator determine clinical significance abnormal ECG find relation subject 's medical history exclude subject would undue risk participate trial . An abnormal clinically significant finding define 12lead tracing interpret , limited , follow : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) rapid ventricular rate &gt; 120 beat per minute ( BPM ) ; Sustained nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) ; Second degree heart block Mobitz type II third degree heart block ( unless pacemaker defibrillator insert ) ; QT interval correct heart rate Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) &gt; =500 millisecond ( msec ) subject QRS &lt; 120 msec QTcF &gt; =530 msec subject QRS &gt; =120 msec . Subjects follow Screening ( Visit 1 ) would exclude : Myocardial infarction unstable angina last 6 month ; Unstable life threaten cardiac arrhythmia require intervention last 3 month ; New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class IV Heart failure . Subjects medical condition narrowangle glaucoma , urinary retention , prostatic hypertrophy bladder neck obstruction include opinion Investigator benefit outweighs risk condition would contraindicate study participation . Subjects carcinoma complete remission least 5 year . Subjects carcinoma situ cervix , squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma skin would exclude base 5 year wait period subject consider cured treatment . Subjects history psychiatric disease , intellectual deficiency , poor motivation condition limit validity inform consent participate study . Subjects medically unable withhold albuterol/salbutamol 6hour period require prior spirometry test study visit . Current smoker smoke history &gt; =10 pack year ( e.g. , 20 cigarettes/day 10 year ) .

Subjects risk noncompliance , unable comply study procedure . Any infirmity , disability , geographic location would limit compliance schedule visit . Study investigator , subinvestigators , study coordinator , employee participate investigator study site , immediate family member aforementioned involved study . In opinion Investigator , subject unable read and/or would able complete study related material . Exclusion Criteria ( randomization ) Occurrence culturedocumented suspected bacterial viral infection upper low respiratory tract , sinus middle ear runin period lead change asthma management , opinion Investigator , expect affect subject 's asthma status subject 's ability participate study . Evidence moderate asthma exacerbation lead change therapy severe exacerbation screen runin period , define deterioration asthma require use systemic corticosteroid ( tablet , suspension , injection ) inpatient hospitalization emergency department visit due asthma require systemic corticosteroid . Changes asthma medication ( exclude change Visit 0 runin medication albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol provide Visit 1 ) . Evidence clinically significant abnormal laboratory test screen runin , still abnormal upon repeat analysis believe due disease ( ) present . Each Investigator use his/her discretion determine clinical significance abnormality .</criteria>
