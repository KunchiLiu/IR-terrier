	<detailed_description>The study plan enrol 300 patient total 20 50 patient assign cohort accord indication , follow : - Cohort 1 : Rare sarcoma - Cohort 2 : Rare ovarian cancer - Cohort 3 : Primary central nervous system lymphoma - Cohort 4 : Rare thyroid cancer - Cohort 5 : Rare malignant neuroendocrine cancer - Cohort 6 : Germ-cell cancer The study use two-stage Bayesian enrichment design . The first stage treats patient different cohort investigational product identifies possibly sensitive indication . The second stage compare outcomes among subset patient identify cohort distinguish subpopulation patient may benefit treatment patient evidence efficacy .</detailed_description>
