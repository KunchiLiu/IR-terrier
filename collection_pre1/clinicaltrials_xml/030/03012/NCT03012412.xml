	<detailed_description>The Mindfulness Based Program Infertility ( MBPI ) develop base Mindfulness Based Program Stress Reduction , Mind/Body Program Infertility basic principle Acceptance Commitment Therapy . This program aim , fundamentally , learn practice emotion regulation skill , particularly mindfulness acceptance . It address value ( choose life direction ) clarification , interpersonal communication , healthy lifestyle , emotional self-care . The training skill occur session also encourage session . Support material provide , include Participant 's Manual audio CD several mindfulness meditation instruction . The MBPI enclose 10 weekly session 2 hour , except one session last one day . It structure psychosocial intervention program , group format ( max . 15 woman ) . Male partner invite participate 3 session . MBPI session carry clinical psychologist previous train contextual-behavioral therapy . A Therapist Manual structure , describe detail conduct session . Most MBPI session follow similar structure . They begin first half-hour sharing ( optional ) . After first half hour formal mindfulness practice hold , follow share participant felt , notice , experience . The set formal practice select MBPI commonly use mindfulness program . Informal mindfulness practice also present early second session mindful eating . The three minute breathe space exercise end session . Metaphors experiential exercise include session . These comprise experiential exercise listen others , introduction value clarification ( value life direction ) imagery exercise `` 10 year marriage '' , integration great number positive aspect day-to-day experience , psychoeducational component regard healthy lifestyle ( exercise , nutrition , caffeine , alcohol , nicotine , etc. ) . Moreover , promotion psychological flexibility/acceptance intend achieve mindfulness practice , also use metaphor `` mind radio always '' , `` coach passenger '' emphasize importance value clarification commit action . Previously data collection , ethical approval obtain Scientific Council Faculty Psychology Educational Sciences University Coimbra . Participants woman age 18 year old old , present medically establish infertility diagnosis . Participants answer recruitment announcement post Portuguese Fertility Association ( patient association ) website get approval association board . Participants inform voluntary confidential nature data . A semi-structured clinical interview use MBPI admission . This interview allow gather demographic clinical data screen severe psychopathology . Women answer recruitment announcement live place MBPI session schedule invited participate study member control group give opportunity participate future edition . All participant require sign inform consent numerical unique code assign participant . The study encompass three different assessment moment ( T0 , T1 , T2 ) namely intervention ( T0 ) , end intervention ( T1 ) six month ( T2 ) . Another follow-up study conduct seven year ( T3 ) intervention also design participant complete MBPI ( control group ) . The assessment protocol complete home . It deliver participant MBPI group admission interview end last MBPI session . It return research team mail . The assessment protocol send return mail participant control group ( stationary post envelope provide ) . Concerning seven year follow-up study data collection carry online . All quantitative data analyze use SPSS ( version 20 ) . Independent sample test conduct explore whether difference group regard demographic variable . Depending nature clinical variable , group compare independent sample test , qui-squared test Fisher test . When significant difference find Pearson point-biserial correlation coefficient use . Independent sample test also perform explore equivalence group regard study variable . The effect size consider analysis Eta square ( ƞ2 ) . To explore mean difference pre-treatment ( T0 ) post-treatment ( T1 ) ( main time effect ) , group ( main group effect ) time X group interaction effect repeat measure ANOVAs conduct , consider MBPI control group between-subjects factor . Mean difference study variable also study group pair sample test . In order explore mean difference post-treatment ( T1 ) , six-months follow-up ( T2 ) 7 year follow-up ( T3 ) MBPI participant repeat measure ANOVAs conduct . Effect size assess partial Eta2 ( ƞ2p ) . Independent sample test repeat measure ANOVAs assumption verify Skweness Kurtosis measure . Sphericity assumption repeat measure ANOVAs analyze Mauchly 's W. Whenever assumption verify use Huynh-Feldt Epsilon ( ɛ &gt; .75 ) Greenhouse-Geisser Epsilon ( ɛ &lt; .75 ) , correspond probability correction factor F statistic significance . Lastly , understand mechanism underlie effect MBPI reduction depressive symptom score , mediation analysis base upon regression analysis conduct . In model , intervention predictor ( cod 0 = control ; 1 = MBPI ) , self-efficacy T1 mediator variable depressive symptom T1 outcome variable . Self-efficacy depressive symptom T0 include covariates model , allow good prediction model , rather use compute variable base change score . Significance indirect effect calculate use PROCESS macro SPSS ( Model 4 ) bootstrap procedure ( 5000 sample ) determine statistical significance .</detailed_description>
