	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot trial study well high low dose cladribine , cytarabine , mitoxantrone work treat medically less fit patient newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia myeloid neoplasm . Drugs use chemotherapy , cladribine , cytarabine , mitoxantrone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether give cladribine , cytarabine , mitoxantrone high low dose may work well treat patient newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Higher Lower Dose Cladribine , Cytarabine , Mitoxantrone Treating Medically Less Fit Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myeloid Neoplasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate feasibility randomize medically less fit adult newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) analogous myeloid neoplasm either intensive non-intensive induction post remission chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate attitude patient physicians toward randomization explore reason treatment preference . II . To evaluate whether ability ass fitness intensive chemotherapy improve augmented treatment-related mortality ( TRM ) score include additional ( co-morbidity ) factor , compare ability physician prediction algorithm ( ) assess likelihood early death . III . To compare , within limit pilot study , response , duration response , survival patient receive intensive receive non-intensive chemotherapy . IV . To describe impact treatment intensity quality life patient undergoing chemotherapy newly diagnose AML . V. To describe impact treatment intensity medical resource utilization care cost patient undergo chemotherapy newly diagnose AML . OUTLINE : Patients agreeable randomization randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Patients agreeable randomization receive treatment base preference . ARM I ( HIGHER-DOSE ) : Patients receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 0-5 , high dose cladribine intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1-5 , high dose cytarabine IV 2 hour day 1-5 , high dose mitoxantrone IV 60 minute day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II ( LOWER-DOSE ) : Patients receive G-CSF SC day 0-5 , low dose cladribine IV 2 hour day 1-5 , low dose cytarabine IV 1 hour day 1-5 , low dose mitoxantrone IV 60 minute day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
