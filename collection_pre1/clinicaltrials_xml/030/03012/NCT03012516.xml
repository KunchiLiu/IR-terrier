	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate one year intervention physical activity prescription ( PAP ) treatment patient primary health care center set versus enhance PAP-support physiotherapist regard physical activity ( PA ) level , metabolic health effect health-related quality life . One hundred ninety patient , 27-85 year , physically inactive , least one component metabolic syndrome responding increase PA level 6-months PAP-treatment primary health care centre randomize either enhanced support physiotherapist ( Intervention group ) continue ordinary PAP-treatment health care centre ( Control group ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim : The aim evaluate whether enhanced support physiotherapist patient non-responders PAP-treatment 6 month follow-up primary health care centre set influence physical activity level , metabolic health effect health-related quality life . Methods : Study design : This randomize control trial ( RCT ) two arm : one intervention group one control group . The present study part ongoing study include 444 patient 5 year follow-up . Study population : The study population include 190 patient , 27-85 year , least component metabolic syndrome ( metS ) non-responding PAP-treatment initiate health care centre . The patient randomize either enhance PAP-support physiotherapist ( Intervention group n = 98 ) continue ordinary PAP-treatment health care centre ( Control group n = 92 ) . Intervention : In control group , PAP-treatment offer authorized personnel , mainly nurse include individualized dialogue concern PA , prescribe PAP individually adjust follow-up . The intervention physiotherapist include fitness test use ergometer bicycle . The result ergometer bicycle test form basis continue motivate dialogue concern physical activity individually dose physical activity regard frequence , duration intensity prescribe PAP . The patient support physiotherapist 7 time one year intervention . Measurements : For group , patient PA-level , metabolic health health relate quality life measure baseline one-year follow-up , health care centre . In intervention group , ergometer bicycle test conduct physiotherapist . Statistical analysis : The size study calculate base power 90 % , detect difference 20 % physical activity level intervention ( 40 % responder ) control ( 20 % responder ) group refer physical activity level ≥5 point , significance level 0.05 . Intention-to-treat analysis use . Data process use Paired sample t-test Wilcoxon sign-rank test base data level within group analysis . Analyses intervention control group perform use Independent sample t-test Mann Whitney U-test . Statistical significance set p ≤ 0.05 . Hypothesis : An enhanced PAP-support physiotherapist give room enlarge effect physical activity level opportunity influence cardiorespiratory fitness , metabolic health health relate quality life . Clinical implication : An increased physical activity level non-responder group via individually design PAP-support physiotherapist increase possibility save time resource patient health care system . Evaluating effect cardiorespiratory fitness addition metabolic health health relate quality life give immerse understanding health effect due intervention .</detailed_description>
