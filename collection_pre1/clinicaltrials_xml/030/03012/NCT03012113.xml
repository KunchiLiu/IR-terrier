	<brief_summary>Obesity type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) emerge problem worldwide . In particular South Asian individual ( represent 20 % world population ) increase risk obesity relate disorder . They high risk development T2D compare white Caucasians develop T2D young age lower BMI . The underlie mechanism might explain ethnical difference clarify understood yet . As consequence , treatment option limit unfocussed , novel specific strategy need . Brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) recently discover major player energy metabolism human . In process know thermogenesis , BAT take fatty acid ( FA ) glucose circulation subsequently combust FA glucose heat , thereby increase energy expenditure improve glucose FA metabolism . Using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) ( positron emission tomography/computed tomography ) PET-CT scan analysis investigator recently show South Asian individual less brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) white Caucasians . This might suggest low energy metabolism , could underlie increased predisposition obesity development T2D . Activation BAT , example cold exposure , show beneficial metabolic effect human . Cold acclimatization increase BAT volume , nonshivering thermogenesis , glucose uptake BAT , well decrease fat mass healthy young men . Therefore activation BAT consider novel therapeutic target treatment obesity T2D . As cold exposure desire therapeutic strategy human , current pre-clinical research focus pharmacological activation BAT . β3-receptor agonist use mimic sympathetic innervation BAT . Our recent study use mice human-like lipoprotein profile show treatment β3-receptor agonist decrease fat mass , improve dyslipidemia , increase insulin sensitivity even attenuate development atherosclerosis . Likewise , novel β3-receptor agonist ( Mirabegron ) recently show activate BAT healthy young men effectively cold exposure . Therefore , ß3-receptor agonism would promise treatment option activate BAT enhance energy expenditure , especially South Asians . Currently common way visualize BAT human 18F-FDG PET-CT scan . However method expensive invasive , use ionize radiation . Recently , MRI , radiation burden , emerge novel method visualize BAT human . Activation BAT result combustion intracellular lipid store , eventually lead low triglyceride ( TG ) content . MRI measure TG content tissue , use MRI technology activation BAT quantify relative reduction TG content BAT . The use MRI visualize quantify BAT activity safe , cost-effective innovative alternative PET-CT , potential become new gold standard nearby future . To investigate whether β3-receptor agonism therapeutic potential improve metabolic phenotype South Asians , investigator perform randomize cross-over study 20 healthy young men age 18-30 year lean body type ( BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2 ) include . Dutch South Asian individual ( n=10 ) match Dutch white Caucasian individual ( n=10 ) participate cross-over study consist three different regime . This study investigate whether β3-receptor agonism therapeutic potential improve metabolic phenotype South Asians . The effect β3-receptor agonist BAT activity South Asians never study . Elucidating effect β3-receptor agonist BAT activity South Asians might major clinical implication , might result discovery potential novel treatment strategy combat obesity T2D especially vulnerable population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In current study , effect one single dose Mirabegron ( 200 mg ) versus placebo cold-exposure study health young ( 18-30 year ) Dutch South Asian ( n=10 ) Dutch Caucasian ( n=10 ) men . All study subject screen . If subject meet inclusion criterion , willing participate study sign informed consent , include . All subject ask make change usual diet physical activity start whole study . At screen thorough medical history physical examination perform . Subjects examine fast state . Anthropometric measurement perform well BIA measurement determination body fat percentage basal blood sample take mean venapunction . Basal blood measurement include kidney , liver , thyroid , hemoglobulin , natrium , kalium , ureum lipid parameter well glucose concentration . If subject eligible participate first complete Study day 1 , measure BAT activity volume cold exposure . Subject undergo baseline oxycon finapres measurement determine REE blood pressure heart rate ( 30 min ) . After baseline MRI scan make follow individualized cooling protocol maximum non-shivering thermogenesis reach . During cold exposure , skin temperature measure via 'iButtons ' . One iButtons place armpit approximation 'core temperature ' . When shiver temperature reach , stable cool period start ( t=0 ) . After 30 minute stable cold exposure ( t=30 ) REE blood pressure heart rate analyze second time use ventilate hood system finapres . Thereafter ( t=60 ) BAT activity volume measure use second MRI scan . Furthermore , cool procedure venous blood sample obtain every 15 minute monitor dynamic change plasma lipid . In addition , plasma catecholamine concentration determine . If increase BAT activity upon cold stimulation subject exclude participation study . If detectable BAT activity Study day 1 , subject participate Study day 2 3 randomized receive first Mirabegron placebo minimize bias . On study day 2 first baseline oxycon finapres measurement perform determine REE blood pressure heart rate ( 30 min ) . Thereafter , subject receive single dose 200 mg Mirabegron ( four table 50 mg ) ( placebo ) ( t=0 ) . Again skin temperature measure via 'iButtons ' . One iButton place armpit approximation 'core temperature ' . After 1 , 2 3 hour ( t=60 , t=120 t=180 ) REE analyze use ventilate hood system blood pressure heart rate monitor use finapres . Thereafter , 3.5 hour administration compound ( t=210 ) BAT activity volume determine use MRI scan . Furthermore , venous blood sample drawn every 15 minute monitor change plasma lipid . In addition , plasma catecholamine concentration determined.Study day 3 exactly study day 2 , except time subject receive compound ( either 200 mg Mirabegron placebo ) . All study day take place Leiden University Medical Centre ( LUMC ) . Between study day 2 3 wash-out period 13 day maintain make sure drug body next exam .</detailed_description>
