	<detailed_description>Study data Data collect eligible patient undergo elective low gastrointestinal surgery within compliance ERAS protocol study month . Only routine clinical data include unavailable domain leave blank e.g . patient require blood test . It possible regional group may supplement core data set limit number additional variable accommodate within two page case record form ( CRF ) comply regulation apply study . Data collection Data collect individual hospital paper CRF patient recruit . Paper CRFs store within lock office centre . This include identifiable patient data order allow follow-up clinical outcome . Data pseudo-anonymised generating unique numeric code transcribe local investigator onto internet base electronic CRF . Each patient identify electronic CRF ( eCRF ) numeric code . Thus co- ordinate study team trace data back individual patient without contact local team . A patient list use centre match identifier code database individual patient order record clinical outcome supply miss data point . Once local co-ordinator confirms data entry complete hospital receive spreadsheet raw ( un-cleaned ) data , allow check data completeness accuracy . Audit organisation POWER lead study management group responsible study administration , communication project partner , data collation data management . Regional co-ordinators lead project Spanish region : - Identify local co-ordinators participate hospital - Assist translation study paperwork require - Ensure distribution study paperwork material - Ensure necessary regulatory approval place prior start date - Ensure good communication participate site his/her region Local co-ordinators individual institution follow responsibility : - Provide leadership study institution - Ensure relevant regulatory approval place institution - Ensure adequate training relevant staff prior data collection - Supervise daily data collection assist problem solve - Act guarantor integrity quality data collect - Ensure timely completion eCRFs supervise local data entry - Communicate relevant national co-ordinator End Study Definition The end study define end 30-day follow-up last patient include . Data analysis shall follow . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Sample size calculation Our plan recruit many centre possible international basis ask include eligible patient study . Only centre include 10 valid patient include data analysis . We specific sample size statistical model adapt event rate provide sample recruit . However , minimum sample size estimate , expect 50 % patient least one complication , data require high sample-size confidence level 95 % accuracy 3 % , total 1068 patient . A large sample size , great accuracy achieve . Statistical analysis Hospitals include data describe less 10 valid patient exclude data analysis . Data present individual region . All regional institutional level data anonymised prior publication . Categorical variable describe proportion compare use chi-square Fisher 's exact test . Continuous variable describe mean standard deviation , normally distribute , median inter-quartile range , normally distribute . Comparisons continuous variable perform use one-way ANOVA Mann-Whitney test appropriate . Univariate analysis perform test factor associate post-operative complication , LOS in-hospital death . Single-level hierarchical multi-level logistic regression model construct identify factor independently associate outcomes adjust difference confound factor . Factors enter model base univariate relation outcome ( p &lt; 0.05 ) , biological plausibility low rate miss data . A stepwise approach use enter new term . Results logistic regression report adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) 95 % confidence interval . The model assess use sensitivity analysis explore possible interact factor examine effect result . A single final analysis plan end study . Overall compliance calculate average pre- intraoperative ERAS adapt element , specify ERAS society colon rectal guideline . For exploratory purpose , post-ERAS patient ' guideline compliance categorise quintiles : compliance &lt; 45 % ( compliance 1 ) , compliance 45-55 % ( compliance 2 ) , compliance 55-65 % ( compliance 3 ) , compliance 65-75 % ( compliance 4 ) compliance &gt; 75 % ( compliance 5 ) . Summary statistic post hoc Bonferroni correction use assess possible dose-response dependence percenctage patient postoperative complication LOS . The data set analyze use percentage patient postoperative complication LOS main secondary outcome variable . The influence follow factor assess : sex , age , American Society anesthesia ( ASA ) status , body mass index ( BMI ) , preoperative hemoglobin , comorbidity , include hypertension , diabetes mellitus , coronary arterial disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , chronic renal disease ; surgical approach ( open , laparoscopic ) , duration surgery , intraoperative fluid administration first 24 hour fluid balance ; individual component ERAS protocol . Univariate analysis initially undertaken ass relationship factor outcome variable . Comparisons make use χ2 test categorical variable test Kruskal-Wallis test use evaluate difference continuous normally non-normally distributed variable , respectively . Owing non-normal distribution , LOS analyze log-normal transformation independent test back exponentiation . Multivariate analysis , use binary logistic regression development complication linear regression log transform length LOS , perform variable univariate analysis significant near-significant difference ( P &lt; 0.1 ) . P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Primary outcome measure The percentage patient develop pre-defined mild-moderate-severe postoperative complication 30 day surgery , include complication occur hospital discharge happen discharge required ambulatory in-hospital care . Postoperative complication define accord standard definition use outcome measure clinical effectiveness research perioperative medicine ( EPCO ) . Secondary outcome measure - In-hospital all-cause mortality ( censored 30 day follow surgery ) - Adherence ERAS item ( within 30 day follow surgery ) - Duration hospital stay ( duration primary hospital stay surgery ) ETHICS The principal investigator must ensure study carry accordance ethical principle Research Governance Framework Health Social Care , Second Edition , 2005 subsequent amendment applicable applicable legal regulatory requirement .
