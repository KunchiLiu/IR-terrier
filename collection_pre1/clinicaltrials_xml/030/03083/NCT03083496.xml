	<detailed_description>Dentin hypersensitivity ( DH ) characterize short , intense sudden pain cause thermal , chemical evaporative stimulus . There several type desensitize agent , use aid control pathology , effective short longevity . The agent base potassium oxalate use dental surgeon mixed action , neural obliterating . Therefore , aim study triple blind randomized clinical trial ( split-mouth ) , evaluate longevity efficacy two product potassium oxalate-based two concentration , 10 % 5 % . Thirty-two DH least 2 teeth adequate oral hygiene randomly divide two different group accord desensitization approach ( 10 % 5 % ) The dentin hypersensitivity level evaluate immediately desensitization 1 , 2 3 . Data collect , tabulate submit statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
