	<brief_summary>The purpose study test influence transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) gaze training ( GT ) acquisition laparoscopic surgical skill . For purpose , investigator compare variant tDCS GT experiment 1 2 , respectively , compare optimal variant experiment 3 crossed design follow test retention . These question evaluate use validated Fundamentals Laparoscopic Surgery ( FLS ) modules 1 5 , overall goal develop surgical training curriculum achieve expert level skill expedite timeframe . This research provide novel approach general surgery training potential reduce amount time repetition require achieve expert laparoscopic skill .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Developing expert performance require assessment thought process underlie performance continue refinement skill order obtain automaticity intuition . Therefore , develop expert surgical skill process likely take long length residency , thereby diminish quality care deliver patient . The propose study implement novel neuroscience technique transcranial direct current stimulation gaze training determine capacity accelerate technical surgical skill learn order achieve competency expertise earlier timeframe . tDCS non-invasive brain stimulation technique delivers constant , low current stimulation via electrode place scalp modify cortical excitability area interest . When applied motor cortex , promise data indicate tDCS-induced change lead expedited recovery stroke patient well enhance learn healthy individual . Studies skill performance demonstrate eye movement pattern optimize improve subsequent motor movement . Therefore , gaze training encourages novice adopt efficient gaze pattern expert perform specific task laparoscopic surgery . These technique never apply train surgical resident make project innovative approach enhance skill development . Experiment 1 : Determine tDCS accelerate learn laparoscopic skill . In experiment investigator compare behavioral learn curve FLS modules 1 5 three cohort undergo either active tDCS bilateral motor cortex ( bilateral configuration ) , active tDCS supplementary motor cortex ( SMA configuration ) , sham tDCS ( half configuration ) . This test group 20 participant train 40-minutes 6 session occur within 3 week . The investigator hypothesize active bilateral SMA tDCS lead faster skill acquisition measure trial require gain proficient completion score ( calculated time plus error ) , relative sham . The investigator hypothesize bilateral vertex tDCS lead faster skill acquisition , bilateral great vertex measure trial require gain proficient module completion score , relative group participant practice without active tDCS . Experiment 2 : Determine gaze train accelerate learn laparoscopic skill . In experiment investigator first establish expert gaze pattern Fundamentals Laparoscopic Surgery modules 1 5 test total 9 participant , include attend surgeon , senior resident , novice train proficiency . The investigator compare behavioral learn curve non-expert participant without gaze training train use explicit ( review expert gaze pattern ) implicit gaze ( use visual mask training , lead participant follow expert gaze ) derive expert gaze pattern . This test 3 group 20 participant , train 40-minutes 6 session occur within 3 week . The investigator hypothesize explicit implicit gaze train lead faster skill acquisition , implicit great explicit measure trial require gain proficient module completion score , relative group participant practice without gaze training . Experiment 3 : Compare tDCS gaze training cross design evaluate learning retention . In experiment investigator utilize effective active tDCS condition experiment 1 effective Gaze Training condition experiment 2 crossed design evaluate learning retention . In crossed design , four group 20 participant receive either : active tDCS gaze training , active tDCS gaze training , gaze training sham tDCS , sham tDCS . In case , participant partake 6 session 40-minutes , train FLS modules 1 5 , also participate follow FLS assessment , 4 6 week completion train evaluate retention train skill . The investigator hypothesize apply tDCS gaze train result additive improvement learn curve , lead great retention train skill follow assessment , compare either condition alone sham group .</detailed_description>
