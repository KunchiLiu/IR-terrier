	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction Sleep apnea common serious health problem Polish population . According epidemiological data problem concern 7 % adult population . The common sleep disorder obstructive sleep apnea ( OBS ) . The essence OBS episodes airway obstruction repeat many time sleep . As result oxygen level blood decrease . The result increase muscle tension upper respiratory tract throat vibration loud snore restore breath . Episodes apnea arousal cause sleep fragmentation , shortage deep sleep rapid eye movement ( REM ) . Such episode occur repeatedly , several , even dozens time per hour sleep . The consequence episodes airway obstruction sleep fragmentation inefficient , lack rest sleep , pathological daytime sleepiness , fall asleep involuntarily , awaken feeling shortness breath throttling . Fragmentation sleep repeat episode hypoxia result deterioration quality life , chronic fatigue increase risk communication accident . The direct consequence sleep apnea hypoxia , awaken , increased heart rate increase blood pressure . Frequent complication obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) hypertension , stroke , cardiac arrhythmia , coronary artery disease , pulmonary hypertension heart failure . If leave untreated , OSA contribute development vascular endothelial dysfunction increase risk premature death , especially men age 50 . An additional problem patient sleep apnea increase incidence bruxism . Bruxism excessive teeth grind jaw clenching . It oral parafunctional activity background increase activity masticatory muscle . It one common oral parafunctions . Bruxism common problem ; report prevalence range 8-31 % general population . The common symptom bruxism include : hypersensitive teeth , tooth wear , damage dental restoration ( e.g . crown filling ) , damage periodontal oral mucosa , masticatory muscle pain headache . Symptoms bruxism may go unnoticed long time , implies patient often n't know disorder . There two different type bruxism : Sleep Bruxism ( SB ) Awake Bruxism ( AB ) . Type SB consist involuntary , episodic rhythmic activity masticatory muscle ( Rhythmic Masticatory Muscle Activity / RMMA ) . The etiology bruxism multifactorial fully understood . It cause local general factor . The main general factor may stress , emotional disturbance mental , neurological , hormonal disorder ( eg . Hyperthyroidism ) , gastrointestinal disease , allergy , medication , smoking , sleep disorder snore . Arousals apnea episode consider major cause sleep bruxism . The relationship obstructive sleep apnea sleep bruxism still clearly define . Further research need help explain relationship two phenomenon , enable therapy patient coexist OSA SB . 2 . Aim The aim study evaluation quality sleep , endothelial function , cardiovascular risk , thyroid function , function masticatory muscle psycho-emotional status patient bruxism . 3 . Methods The project take place Sleep Laboratory Department Internal Medicine , Occupational Diseases Hypertension Medical University Wroclaw . About 100 patient refer Department Internal Medicine , Occupational Diseases Hypertension Clinical Oncology suspect sleep apnea bruxism include . Dentists co-worker . Patients Clinic Prosthodontics operate Department Prosthodontics , Medical University Wroclaw dental institution diagnose use Diagnostic Criteria temporomandibular Disorders ( DC / TMD ) Criteria American Academy Sleep Medicine International Classification Diseases ICD -10-CM evaluate bruxism direct full polysomnography ( PSG ) video record . Polysomnograms evaluate 30-second contribution , accord standard sleep criterion . PSG result contain data latency sleep , total sleep time ( TST ) , sleep efficiency ( % ) evaluation phase N1 , N2 , N3 REM . Pathological respiratory event evaluate accordance standard American Academy Sleep . Apnea define absence airflow respiratory tract 10 second . The shallowness breathing define decrease respiratory amplitude 30 % 10 second , subsequent desaturation 3 % subsequent awakening . Then , evaluate function vascular endothelium patient expansion brachial artery use ultrasonography Aloka Prosound Alpha 6 , use guideline international work group study reactivity brachial artery explore . Ultrasound heart , Electrocardiography Holter Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) perform patient . In addition , researcher execute survey : Epworth Scale , Athens Scale , STOP-Bang Scale , Berlin questionnaire , severity level fatigue / tiredness scale , questionnaire assessing quality life , scale perceive stress - questionnaire PSS 10 questionnaire Oral Behavior Checklist ( OBC ) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index ( PSQI ) . Headache episode assess use Headache Impact Test - 6 ( HIT-6 ) HUNT questionnaire . Each patient perform clinical test blood determine level FT3 , FT4 TSH order evaluate relationship RMMA thyroid disease . At time relationship bruxism , psycho-emotional state sleep quality evaluate questionnaire PSS10 , OBC PSQI . Masticatory muscle activity study assess basis record come electromyography electrode place beard symmetrically around masseter muscle attachment . The result analyze incidence RMMA directly relate episode bruxism relation episodes sleep apnea , change blood pressure heart rate determine prevalence cause-effect relationship .</detailed_description>
