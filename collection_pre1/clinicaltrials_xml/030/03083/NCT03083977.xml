	<brief_summary>Chronic pain common ailment age population often co-occur altered regulation autonomic nervous system . Nociceptive pathway ( i.e. , transmit pain signal ) integrate autonomic circuit throughout body therapy successful reduce pain concurrently alter autonomic function , even directly design . It possible intervention target autonomic circuit regulate pain response may help reduce pain chronic pain sufferer . The propose study examine whether intervention target autonomic nervous system via filtered music reduce pain , hypothesis derive Polyvagal Theory . The Polyvagal Theory describe function structure vertebrate autonomic nervous system change evolution . The theory name vagus , major cranial nerve regulates bodily state . An evolutionary `` old '' branch nerve innervate structure diaphragm dysfunction link low body organ tissue pain . Regulation vagus nerve link specific auditory cue base evolutionary heritage physic middle ear . This study design test whether processed music design stimulate vagal function decrease chronic pain . The Listening Project Protocol , process music use intervention , previously show effectively stimulate function vagus nerve ( see stimulus description ) . Specific Aims : Aim I : To examine whether The Listening Project Protocol , non-invasive audio intervention , effective reduce chronic pain sample old adult . Hypothesis : Five 1-hour session Listening Project Protocol reduce pain Aim II : To examine whether increased regulation via autonomic nervous system account decrease pain intervention successful . Hypothesis : Pain reduction coincide improve autonomic function myelinated vagus nerve ( measured respiratory sinus arrhythmia , see ) well decrease reactivity autonomic function everyday experience ( measure Body Perception Questionnaire , see )</brief_summary>
