	<brief_summary>Application Nanotechnology Chemical Sensors Diagnosis Decompensated Heart Failure Respiratory Samples . Breath testing , link specific volatile molecular biomarkers exhale breath medical condition , become increasingly popular non-invasive potentially inexpensive diagnostic method various disease . NA-NOSE performs odor detection exhaled breath , thus produce distinct fingerprint mixture analytes . Several study publish , state advantage sensor , lead promise outcomes several field . The NA-NOSE breath test would fast ( examination result would obtain within 5-10 min ) , inexpensive , eventually portable ( small desktop computer ) , non-invasive free side effect .</brief_summary>
