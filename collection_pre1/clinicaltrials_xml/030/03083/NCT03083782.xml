	<brief_summary>This study aim evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) apixaban co-administered cyclosporine tacrolimus healthy volunteer . The study participant receive apixaban alone , cyclosporine follow apixaban tacrolimus follow apixaban .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Drug Interaction Study Apixaban With Cyclosporine Tacrolimus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Life- graft-threatening complication solid organ transplant patient greatly reduce due potent immunosuppressive agent like calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) include cyclosporine tacrolimus . Venous thromboembolism ( clots leg lung ) transplant recipient often difficult manage due polypharmacy potential drug interaction . More 90 % renal transplant ( RT ) recipient maintain CNI-based immunosuppressive regimen . Cyclosporine inhibitor many metabolic pathway include cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 , permeability glycoprotein ( P-gp ) , breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) . Tacrolimus share distributive metabolic pathway cyclosporine . Apixaban combine substrate CYP3A4 , P-gp , BCRP thus potential drug interaction cyclosporine tacrolimus . Apixaban level high low could problem transplant patient . The purpose study determine happen apixaban blood level give combination cyclosporine tacrolimus .</detailed_description>
