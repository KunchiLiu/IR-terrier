	<criteria>Patients must chronic GVHD ( cGVHD ) occur type HSC transplantation : type donor ( HLAidentical sibling HLAmatched mismatch family unrelated donor ) ; type conditioning ( fullintensity , reducedintensity , nonmyeloablative , condition ) ; type HSC ( bone marrow , PBSC , cord blood ) donor lymphocyte infusion . Patients must cGVHD primarily affect least one follow organ : skin ; oral mucosal ; eye ; liver ; lung ; joint ; fascia . Gastrointetinal ( GI ) cGVHD alone sufficient inclusion criterion . Patients must cGVHD already treat firstline systemic therapy least 1 month effective dos . Firstline systemic therapy must include least prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day equivalent . In case formal contraindication steroid therapy , firstline systemic therapy must include therapeutic dos least one follow drug : tacrolimus ciclosporine ( patient treat calcineurin inhibitor onset cGVHD ) , sirolimus , everolimus , mycophenolate mofetyl . Patients must require salvage therapy cGVHD either refractoriness contraindication/intolerance current therapy . Need salvage therapy define follow criterion : development 1 new site disease treat chronic GVHD progression exist site disease receive treatment chronic GVHD failure improve despite least 1 month standard treatment chronic GVHD , relapse/progression cGVHD taper current treatment cGVHD . Patients may receive number previous line treatment cGVHD . Concomitant treatment immunosuppressor allow start maintain constant dosage least one month start ECP . Shorter delay accept patient highly progressive GVHD require salvage therapy . Signed informed consent . Any age . Weight &gt; 15 Kg ( leukapheresis ) . Weight &lt; 15 Kg acceptable suitable method leukapheresis develop approve site . Patient receive investigational agent chronic GVHD past 4 week . Patient start new line systemic therapy cGVHD past 4 week . Shorter delay accept patient highly progressive GVHD require salvage therapy . Known sensitivity psoralen compound 8methoxypsoralen Comorbidities may result photosensitivity ( coexist skin cancer photosensitive disease ( porphyria , lupus , albinism… ) Aphakia . MOP contraindicate patient aphakia , significantly increase risk retinal damage due absence lens Known allergy one component use apheresis ( e.g. , heparin citrate ) . History heparininduced thrombocytopenia patient serious coagulation disorder . Unable tolerate apheresis procedure include extracorporeal volume shift uncompensated congestive heart failure , pulmonary edema , severe lung disease , severe renal failure , hepatic encephalopathy , reason . Bilirubin &gt; 25 mg/L . Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.0 x 109 / L despite use growth factor Platelet count &lt; 20 x 109 / L despite platelet transfusion HIV seropositivity . Uncontrolled infection Relapse progression hematological malignancy . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) score &gt; 2 . Pregnancy breastfeed Patient fertile man woman unwilling use contraceptive technique 12 month follow treatment . Any serious illness expect survival less 6 month . Any clinically significant medical condition investigator 's opinion could interfere administration photopheresis interpretation study result , compromise safety wellbeing patient .</criteria>
