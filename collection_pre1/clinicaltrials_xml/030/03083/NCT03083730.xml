	<brief_title>Impact Narrowband UVB Phototherapy Systemic Inflammation Patients With Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Globally , lead cause death cardiovascular disease , often link chronic inflammation . Recently , show atopic dermatitis ( AD ) , common chronic inflammatory skin disease , show increase inflammatory cardiovascular risk marker patient blood ( protein , microparticles , circulate inflammatory cell ) . Consistently , demonstrate atopic dermatitis associate increase cardiovascular disease . Whether increase inflammatory and/or cardiovascular risk marker peripheral blood due skin inflammation , due body source ( e.g . lung , lymphatic system ) unknown . To investigate whether ( ) risk protein present patient blood produce inflamed skin , investigator want treat patient suffer moderate-to-severe AD ultra-violet light B ( UVB ) therapy , therapy think exclusive skin treatment , without direct systemic effect . This notion corroborate fact skin region directly treat UVB light , cover skin region , respond phototherapy . Ultra-violet light B ( UVB ) therapy use dermatologist treat AD decade , 1990ies , narrow band-UVB ( NB-UVB ) wavelength ( 311-312nm ) find best treatment effect . This safe effective therapy majority patient , main drawback inconvenient , patient need attend clinic three time week least 8 week . The mechanism action appear include kill skin immune cell , also appear regulate inflammatory molecule IFNg , IL-12 IL-23 . However , systematic study impact NBUVB blood biomarkers never perform . In study , participant treat appropriate dose NB-UVB three time week 12 week total 36 treatment , blood drawn assess inflammatory cardiovascular risk marker ( protein , microparticles , circulate blood cell ) . Results compare level blood healthy control participant . This study could lead new understanding role skin source systemic inflammation , would help guide future treatment approach debilitate , chronic skin disease .</detailed_description>
