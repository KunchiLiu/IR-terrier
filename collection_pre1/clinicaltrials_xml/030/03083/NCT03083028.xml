	<brief_title>Combined Randomised Observational Study Surgery Type B Ankle Fracture Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Ankle fracture common . Recent clinical study show increase incidence ankle fracture . Treatments vary clear consensus ideal approach type 44−B1 distal fibular fracture . They range open reduction internal fixation restore anatomical alignment wear below−knee walk plaster average six week . The argument surgical fixation address minor displacement possible future displacement therefore potentially preventing future arthritis . On hand , numerous complication associate surgery . The argument non−operative treatment non−union common complication . Therefore surgery avoid majority case avoid clinical risk associate surgery . Aim : Primary aim : To compare , ankle function quality life 5 year follow isolated AO type 44−B1 distal fibula fracture minimal talar shift , patient treat operatively non−operatively . Research Design : Combined Randomised Observational Study Methods : Recruitment : All consecutive patient present recruit hospital distal fibular fracture study period screen eligibility . In hospital , surgeon on-call roster participate study . Consenting patient surgeon agree participate randomised arm trial invite treatment randomise . Patients surgeon involve observational component study invite include observational arm together patient decline randomise , consent follow-up Written , inform consent obtain . Eligible patient surgeon participate randomised arm option treatment randomise . If consent give , surgeon call central number patient allocation available 24 hour per day , 7 day per week . The randomisation schedule prepare administered external party otherwise involved study . If patient decline randomisation , treatment determine surgeon-patient discussion . Eligible patient surgeon involve observational arm also treatment provide ( operative non-operative ) per usual surgeon practice . Typical demographic , anthropometric surgical detail ( appropriate ) record contextual reference . Surgical intervention : The surgical technique patient manage operatively , observational randomise arm study , include fixation use plate screw . Any adverse intra-operative post-operative event record . This include limited death , infection , VTE neurovascular injury . Post-operatively , patient non weight bearing place below-knee plaster cast walking boot . Discharge hospital determine patient 's ability walk 25 unaided standby assistance determine physiotherapist . The treat surgeon review patient 10-14 day assessment wound , removal suture change cast fibreglass cast walk boot ( cam walker ) . The patient allow WBAT ( weight bearing tolerate ) 4 week . This protocol represent usual post-operative practice injury , determined meeting Australian Orthopaedic Trauma Society . Non−Operative management : Patients treat non-operatively treated walk boot allow WBAT . Discharge hospital determine surgical arm . All patient review 7 14 day post injury repeat radiograph treat surgeon . This represent usual non-operative treatment injury . Other management decision need antibiotic , VTE prophylaxis anaesthetic type per usual care institution record research team . Referral physiotherapy post removal cast boot ( either study arm ) base presence overt ankle stiffness affect gait . The use physiotherapy ( type duration ) note . Specific prescription type physiotherapy possible patient free access public private service . Study participant record hospitalisations visit health professional . They require report main reason health service occasion first year follow-up period . Outcomes collected result report peer−reviewed journal appropriate statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
