	<brief_summary>This current study intend complete umbrella current GHUCCTS IRB- approve study `` Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia In Prescription Opioid Abusers : Effects Pregabalin '' ( Lyrica study ) ( PRO00000669 ) . In proposed study , 10 healthy male , 10 healthy female participant 5 male , 5 female OIH participant ( parent Lyrica study ) , prescription opioid abuser chronic pain currently take Suboxone , ask take cold pressor test 1 , 5 , 9 degree Celsius report time pain completely go away follow test . The purpose study examine water temperature cold pressure test might affect participant ' response ( i.e. , participant pain threshold pain tolerance ) see difference participation group affect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Water Temperature Cold Pressor Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 1940s , cold pressor test ( CPT ) use experimentally pain induction method due reliability , cost effectiveness minimal production side effect . In CPT , patient ask place hand forearm ice bath pain great remain water . Researchers employ CPT test wide range pain management technique , include medication , cognitive- base therapy , acupuncture , well explore pain perception . The CPT perform variety participant , include adolescent , drug abuser , suffer chronic back pain . In classic 1989 paper , Walsh colleague develop normative model CPT demonstrate variation response dependent upon age , sex ethnicity . In 2004 , however , Mitchell et al . discovered water temperature CPT also play crucial role pain tolerance time subject , note temperature variation 4Â°C produce significantly different result subject . While Mitchell investigation improve upon standard proper CPT technique , see implement work Rash Campbell , discovery base healthy individual . Researchers explore CPT response patient alter pain perception , patient Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia ( OIH ) , comparison healthy control , demonstrate great sensitivity OIH patient . What study effect temperature CPT response OIH patient . Further , CPT show relatively lengthy recovery time average around 10 minute ; however , recovery time hypersensitive patient , OIH patient , yet study . As extension work Mitchell colleague , propose research ass effect temperature difference recovery time CPT patient OIH comparison healthy normal control patient . This work sub-study large study , Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia In Prescription Opioid Abusers : Effects Pregabalin ( PRO00000669 ) , conduct principal investigator Dr. Peggy Compton . The goal parent study evaluate ability pregabalin diminish chronic low back arthritic pain OIH sample prescription opioid abuser ( POAs ) opioid therapy . This current study assign specific intervention study subject . Healthy control OIH participant complete study measure single two-hour study session .</detailed_description>
