	<brief_summary>To evaluate effectiveness three different daily dos pea rice protein hydrolysates versus placebo , consume 12-week period , reduce maintain glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) level pre-diabetic population ( otherwise healthy subject impair glucose metabolism ) . To evaluate effectiveness three different daily dos pea rice protein hydrolysates versus placebo , consume 12-week period : post-prandial glucose/insulin level ( oral glucose tolerance test , fructosamine level , fast plasma glucose level , vital sign , physical examination , weight blood pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Protein Hydrolysates HbA1c Levels Pre-diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes recognise epidemic globally within EU . Environmental behavioural change last century , sedentary lifestyle , intake calorie dense/sugary food obesity significant contributor create dramatic increase incidence diabetes globally . There 60 million people , 11 % total population , diabetes European Region . This number swell 15 % EU population 2030 . Europe spend €89 billion directly treat manage diabetes relate complication 2011 . This cost however severely understated true cost diabetes also include indirect cost , productivity loss due lose working time absenteeism , sickness , early retirement premature death . The WHO project diabetes 7th lead cause death 2030 already fourth develop country world . Additionally , individual diabetes twice likely admitted hospital . According International Diabetes Federation ( IDF ) , diabetes number one cause admission dialysis kidney transplant programme lead cause work age blindness . It also account risk lower limb amputation 10 12 % . Therefore , clear diabetes huge grow impact individual sufferer well place huge strain health system exchequer fund . 90 % diabetes patient globally type 2 diabetes refer diabetes document go forward type 2 refer . This chronic disease state occur body use insulin properly cause glucose level blood rise high normal . This abnormal state time lead serious damage heart , blood vessel , eye , kidney , nerve . Prediabetic individual define blood sugar level higher normal yet high enough classified Diabetes , prediabetes think clear , early warning sign diabetes . Without intervention , prediabetes likely become type 2 diabetes 10 year less . The increase number new case prediabetes present global concern carry large-scale implication towards future burden healthcare . Between 2003 2011 , prevalence prediabetes England alone triple , 35.3 % adult population , 1 every 3 people , prediabetes . The International Journal health science succinctly state well-accepted fact : `` intervention prior onset type 2 diabetes may way prevent complication diabetes '' . In addition , diabetes occurs irreversible , thus prevention hold last beacon epidemic control future . Whilst significant lifestyle change impactful , sustain compliance limit therefore result poor . As result , European Commission highlight functional food valuable solution treatment prevention diabetes . A functional food , `` beneficially affect one target function body beyond adequate nutritional effect way relevant either improved state health well-being and/or reduction risk disease . Peptides derive range food material show prevent disease i.e . inflammatory disorder [ 1 ] osteoporosis [ 2 ] high blood pressure [ 3 ] promote health i.e . immunomodulatory [ 4 ] , antimicrobial [ 5 ] , anti-oxidative [ 6 ] , antithrombotic [ 7 ] , hypo-cholesterolemic [ 8 ] activity . Peptides protein molecules small 10 kDa may exist naturally derive full length protein . Bioactive peptide define specific protein fragment positive effect body function condition may influence human health [ 9 ] . Peptides produce hydrolysis food material digestive , microbial , plant proteolytic enzyme , level generally increase food fermentation [ 10 ] . Bioactive peptide particular amino-acid sequence , inactive intact protein molecule become bioactive release intact molecule action digestive enzyme body action proteolytic enzyme food processing . Pea rice protein hydrolysates show display stimulatory effect insulin responsive glucose transport protein , GLUT4 , facilitate glucose transport skeletal muscle . Skeletal muscle predominant site glucose disposal ( 80 % ) insulin-stimulated post-prandial condition hypothesize one Nuritas pea rice protein hydrolysate could help reduce HbA1c level elevate HbA1c level ( prediabetes ) . The main aim evaluate effectiveness three different daily dos pea rice protein hydrolysates versus placebo , consume 12-week period , reduce maintain glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) level pre-diabetic population ( otherwise healthy subject impair glucose metabolism ) , well post-prandial glucose/insulin level ( oral glucose tolerance test ) , fructosamine level , fast plasma glucose level , vital sign , physical examination , weight , blood pressure .</detailed_description>
