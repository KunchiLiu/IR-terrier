	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Continuation Therapy Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . Patients treat PD-1 PD-L1 inhibitor experience PFS ≥3 month enrol within 6 week last dose PD-1 PD-L1 inhibitor . On Day 1 3-week cycle , subject first receive pembrolizumab dose 200mg IV every three week combination chemotherapy . Partner chemotherapy either gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV D1 D8 every three week , docetaxel 75mg/m2 IV D1 every three week , pemetrexed 500mg/m2 IV D1 every 3 week ( pemetrexed non-squamous histology ) . Subjects continue receive combination progression intolerable toxicity . Administration Sequence : First Sequence - Pembrolizumab 200mg IV Day 1 ( cycle = 21 day ) Administration Sequence : Second Sequence - Gemcitabine 1000mg/m^2 IV Days 1,8 ( cycle = 21 day ) - Docetaxel 75mg/^2 IV Days 1,8 ( cycle = 21 day ) - Pemetrexed 500mg/m^2 IV Day 1 ( cycle -= 21 day )</detailed_description>
