	<detailed_description>The age-related loss skeletal muscle mass associate substantial social economic cost evidence impairment strength , limitation function , ultimately , physical disability institutionalization ( 1-3 ) . Improved knowledge physiologic mechanism mediate impairment physical function crucial develop effective therapeutic intervention preserve mobility independence among physically frail adult . To date , pharmacodynamic marker use clinical trial mobility-limited older adult limit . Lean body mass measure dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) frequently use early phase clinical development investigational anabolic drug . Although increase muscle mass consider contribute increase muscle strength , alone completely explain change physical performance . Thus , direct pharmacodynamic evidence associate physical functioning desire early phase clinical development decision making . Assessments muscle power fatigue address need . For example , Bean et al report improvement leg power , independent strength , appear make important contribution clinically meaningful improvement SPPB ( Short Physical Performance Battery ) gait speed ( 4 ) . Avin Frey Law perform systematic meta-analysis study report fatigue task ( voluntary activation ) perform relative-intensity young ( 18-45 year age ) old ( &gt; 54 year age ) healthy adult conclude old adult able sustain relative-intensity task significantly longer less force decay young adult although age-related difference present sustain intermittent isometric contraction age-related advantage lose dynamic task ( 5 ) . The use assessment may provide meaningful information pharmacodynamics effect investigational drug muscle parameter . This study serve validation study , aim 1 ) examine effect 12-week resistance program may muscle power fatigue ; 2 ) examine effect 12-week resistance exercise program conventional measure muscle function ; 3 ) determine relationship muscle power/fatigue conventional measure physical function . Data study serve rationale potentially include measure pharmacodynamics marker study novel therapy skeletal muscle loss and/or weakness .</detailed_description>
