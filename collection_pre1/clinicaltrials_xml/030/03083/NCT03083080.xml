	<brief_summary>Traditionally , video-assisted thoracic surgery perform general anesthesia double-lumen endotracheal tube . However , complication associate large tube well inhalation anesthetic frequently report . Therefore , currently trend toward non-intubated anesthesia method video-assisted thoracic surgery , include thoracic epidural block , peripheral nerve block , local anesthesia , local combine peripheral nerve block , etc . Thoracic epidural block demand high technique , still risk catastrophic neurological complication case accidental dural puncture . Local anesthesia , perhaps straightforward , however may need supplemental analgesia incision , inevitably interrupt surgery negatively affect patient . This study aim apply ultrasound guidance local anesthetic injection local anesthesia-based video assist thoracic surgery , help inject local anesthetic key intercostal nerve plane provide specific precise blockade , thus avoid chance blind injection . At time , ultrasound guidance potential reduce risk systemic toxicity , prolong duration analgesia postoperatively , facilitates postoperative recovery .</brief_summary>
