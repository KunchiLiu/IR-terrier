	<brief_summary>Background : People get malaria bite infect mosquito . Researchers study vaccine strategy . They give people malaria parasite inject live infectious malaria parasites antimalarial medication see strategy prevents malaria infection antimalarial medication . Objective : To see combine high dose live , infectious malaria parasite ( know Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge ) two FDA approve drug kill malaria parasite ( pyrimethamine [ PYR ] OR chloroquine [ CQ ] ) safe provide people protection malaria . Eligibility : Healthy adult age 18-50 : - pregnant breastfeeding plan become pregnant study - infect HIV , Hepatitis B Hepatitis C - reliable early morning access NIH Clinical Center - able come outpatient clinic frequently , sometimes daily Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They heart , blood , urine test . - Participants blood drawn test visit . - Participants keep track temperature symptom section study . - Participants join one part study . Part 1 one month : - Participants get parasite injection vein day 1 receive antimalarial medication . - They daily visit day 7-14 - They take another antimalarial visit day 15-17 . - The final visit day 29 . Part 2 seven month : - For first 3 month , participant get parasite injection vein 3 injection total . Each injection occur per month take antimalarial drug . - They daily visit day 7-14 first injection , day 7-11 second third injection . - They final ( fourth ) injection around month 6 without antimalarial medication . - After fourth injection , participant may 21 daily visit day 7 injection end study . Part 3 one month : - Participants get parasite injection vein day 1 without antimalarial medication . - They visit almost every day start day 7 injection . - They take antimalarial medication diagnose malaria - They return final end study visit day 27-29 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge With Pyrimethamine Chemoprophylaxis ( PfSPZ-CVac Approach ) : Trial Determine Safety Development Protective Efficacy After Exposure Only Pre-erythrocytic Stages Plasmodium Falciparum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human study show immunization bite Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) sporozoite ( SPZ ) -infected mosquitoes drug coverage chloroquine , approach call chemoprophylaxis sporozoite ( CPS ) infection treatment vaccination ( ITV ) , provide high level , long term protection homologous control human malaria infection ( CHMI ) . The Sanaria PfSPZ chemoprophylaxis vaccination ( PfSPZ CVac ) approach duplicate injectable SPZ regimen . In approach , whether mosquito syrinx use SPZ administration , chloroquine use chemoprophylactic agent , transient , limited , asexual erythrocytic stage see majority participant . Thus question remain whether significant protective efficacy see achieve pre-erythrocytic ( sporozoite/liver stage ) exposure . Previously , perform phase 1 study investigate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity , protective efficacy Sanaria PfSPZ CVac chloroquine ( sporozoite , liver , blood stage ) pyrimethamine chloroquine ( sporozoites liver stage ) describe stage specific sterile protection ( NIAID protocol # 15-I-0169 ) . In study , demonstrate pyrimethamine safe administer , well tolerate , prevent subpatent patent parasitemia ( qPCR blood smear negative ) 100 % time Sanaria PfSPZ CVac . The study also duplicate result previously report Sanaria PfSPZ CVac chloroquine term safety profile protective efficacy homologous CHMI . Although combination Sanaria PfSPZ CVac pyrimethamine PfSPZ Challenge 51,200 PfSPZ provide significant protection homologous CHMI , demonstrate protective immunity develop without evidence blood stage exposure PfSPZ CVac . Building result take lesson learn pre-erythrocytic vaccine study model show importance reach minimal antigen threshold require development sterile immunity , propose study ass safety , tolerability , immunogenicity , protective efficacy increase dose Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge sporozoites receive similar dos pyrimethamine . Additionally , explore impact increase number Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge sporozoites chloroquine prophylaxis heterologous protection . The result study contribute understand target mechanisms immunity Pf malaria infection degree exposure parasite ( pre-erythrocytic erythrocytic stage ) impact responses subsequent protective efficacy .</detailed_description>
