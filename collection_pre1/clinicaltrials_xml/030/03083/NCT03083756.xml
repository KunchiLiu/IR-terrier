	<brief_summary>This study validate usefulness SIMPLICITY score characterize immune status kidney transplant receiver two point along course ( one six month transplantation ) , determination peripheral blood various parameter relate cellular immunity ( count subpopulation CD3+ ( cluster differentiation 3 ) , CD4+ ( cluster differentiation 4 ) CD8+ ( cluster differentiation 8 ) ) , humoral immunity ( immunoglobulins count ) innate ( complement ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The monitoring various parameter relate cellular humoral immunity ( lymphocyte , immunoglobulin complement ) score ( SIMPLICITY ) ( 8 ) would allow identification renal transplant recipient high risk post-transplant infection . Prolonged prolong use CMV ( Cytomegalovirus ) prophylaxis may modify risk . The SIMPLICITY score ( Seeking Immune Status base Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes , Immunoglobulins Complement Activity ) practical score base monitoring readily available immunological parameter assess risk infection RT ( Renal transplant ) . In order perform score , total lymphocyte count peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulation ( PBLSs ) , serum immunoglobulin level ( IgG , IgA ( Immunoglobulin A ) IgM ) serum complement level ( C3 C4 ) baseline investigate , one month 6 month transplantation . The validation new score would allow weapon would lead reduce maximum pharmacological immunosuppression use strict prophylactic measure patient . The result present study may provide insight clinically scientifically relevant aspect infection recipient RT undergo immunosuppressive therapy : From point view assistance , hypothesis study confirm , possibility elaborate specific strategy prophylaxis early treatment ( antibiotic , antifungal antiviral ) , adjust risk recipient present infectious event evolution post transplantation accord SIMPLICITY score . Likewise , could lay foundation design individualized immunosuppression guideline , risk infectious complication could evaluate jointly graft rejection . And base simple immunological parameter , economic determination accessible center environment , circumstance would favor immediate application usual clinical practice . Given literature line research scarce , hypothesis intend demonstrate novel conceptually attractive , result study able publish journal high impact index field immunology Management infectious complication RT .</detailed_description>
