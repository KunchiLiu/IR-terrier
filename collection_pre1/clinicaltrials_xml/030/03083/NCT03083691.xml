	<criteria>Cohort 1 : Subjects histologically cytologically confirm advanced nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer present stage IIIB stage IV disease failure platinumbased firstline therapy . Subjects receive adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy definitive chemoradiation develop recurrence progression , evidence stage IIIBIV disease within 6 month completion therapy , eligible . Cohort 2 : Subjects histologically cytologically confirm limitedstage extensivestage small cell lung cancer failure platinumbased firstline therapy . Cohort 1 Cohort 2 : Signed date write informed consent form must obtain performance studyspecific procedure Male female patient ≥ 18 year age Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 01 Subjects must willing undergo least 2 biopsy ( baseline start Treatment Part B ) Subjects must consider suitable conduction 2 biopsy ( baseline case progression ) responsible local investigator Measurable disease CT MRI per RECIST 1.1 criterion . Screening laboratory value must meet follow criterion obtain within 28 day prior registration : white blood cell count ≥ 2000/μL , Neutrophils ≥ 1500/μL , Platelets ≥ 100 x103/μL , Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL , Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥ 40 mL/min , AST/ALT ≤ 3 x ULN patient without liver metastasis , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 5 x ULN patient liver metastasis , Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( except subject Gilbert Syndrome , total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL ) Prior chemotherapy must complete least 4 week study drug administration , AEs either return baseline stabilize . Prior palliative radiotherapy must complete least 14 day prior study drug administration Prior target therapy must complete least 4 week prior study drug administration Subjects central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis eligible CNS metastasis treat subject neurologically return baseline ( except residual sign symptom related CNS treatment ) least 28 day prior first dose study drug administration . In addition , subject must either corticosteroid stable dose decrease dose ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone ( equivalent ) . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use appropriate method ( ) contraception must agree use adequate method avoid pregnancy 5 month last dose study drug . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit bHCG ) within 24 hour prior start nivolumab . Women must breastfeed . Men sexually active WOCBP must use contraceptive method failure rate le 1 % per year . Men receive nivolumab sexually active WOCBP must willing adhere contraception period 7 month post treatment completion . Subjects squamous cell NSCLC Cohort 1 : activate epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) translocation Medical condition associate significantly increase risk bleed complication cause biopsy procedure ( e.g . know coagulopathies , therapeutic anticoagulation ) Active brain metastasis leptomeningeal metastasis . Subjects brain metastasis eligible metastasis treat magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evidence progression 4 week treatment complete within 28 day prior first dose study drug administration . There must also requirement immunosuppressive dos systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 2 week prior study drug administration . Presence history primary malignancy NSCLC Cohort 1 SCLC Cohort 2 within 5 year prior enrolment trial , except adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin adequately treat situ carcinoma . Active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects permit enrol vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger . Positive test hepatitis B hepatitis C indicate acute chronic infection Known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . Subjects condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day first dose study drug administration . Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement steroid dose &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease . Interstitial lung disease symptomatic may interfere detection management suspect drugrelated pulmonary toxicity Prior systemic treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCTLA4 antibody , antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation immune checkpoint pathway . Prisoners subject involuntarily incarcerate Any serious uncontrolled medical disorder , active infection , physical exam finding , laboratory finding , alter mental status , psychiatric condition , opinion investigator , would limit subject 's ability comply study requirement , substantially increase risk subject , impact interpretability study result . Allergies Adverse Drug Reaction : History allergy study drug component history severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody Current treatment within another therapeutic clinical trial</criteria>
