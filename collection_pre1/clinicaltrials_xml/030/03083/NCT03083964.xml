	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : After participant consent phone clinic , Research Assistants ( RA ) schedule baseline assessment . Baseline interviewer administer survey question , assessment , equipment set-up complete participant ' home allow physical environment assessment home . Assessments survey carry use Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ; see Resources ) . The in-home baseline assessment pilot propose study take 1 1.5 hour . Global Positioning System ( GPS ) locating , accelerometry , bite monitoring , EMA survey operate mHealth app immediate 2-4 week period . For GPS locating , mHealth app use software identifies send longitude latitude time EMA response secure IU server . Software determine address location whether participant 's home , work , restaurant , retail store , etc . For message , mHealth app use `` Push Notification '' deliver EMA request device ( i.e. , smartphone ) . This bypass phone carrier 's Short Message Service ( SMS ) gateway , always reliable secure . The mHealth app make sure message deliver secure . Participants receive notification open application answer EMA question . The database locate secure network within Indiana University server . None data store inside smartphone rest . The actual question brief radio button response . At end 2-4 week window , RAs return home collect accelerometer bite counter take 1 hour . The accelerometer bite counter mark RA study participant ID data retrieve . At time , participant respond 75 % message 2-4 week period , randomize Usual Care ( UC ) Priming Arm Aim 2 give instruction next step study participation . Randomization carry within race group ensure balance number subject two treatment arm . The Investigator computer-generate randomization list field envelope provide RAs treatment assignment . Aim 2 : The second aim study last 6 month . Both UC Priming arm full access Healthy-Me coach class well receive train access mHealth app . When study participation exclude , apps associate data remove smartphone . At time Patient Health Information ( PHI ) store smartphone . Smartphones identify study ID number developer access participant ' study ID number smartphone data collect mHealth app . Subjects UC Priming undergo similar assessment procedure ; however , Priming arm participant , addition receive 6-8 message alert per day . The application notification use Priming arm build participant library deliver time location Aim 1 data indicate often experience eat sedentary cue . In short , intervention counter obesogenic cue `` healthy '' prime real-time location . Finally , follow 6 month UC Priming , blind RAs return participant home complete 6-month follow-up assessment collect study related equipment . The final assessment survey take 1-1.5 hour data capture also carry REDCap .</detailed_description>
