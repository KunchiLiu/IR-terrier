	<brief_summary>Epilepsy affect 0.5 0.7 % European population . Despite availability numerous drug treatment , one third patient still seizures , associate significant cognitive social complication excess mortality . In patient , surgical treatment remove epileptogenic zone ( EZ ) , region brain responsible seizure , approach allow control disease . However , investigate surgery , investigation answer two question : ( ) location extension EZ ( ii ) functional risk , motor cognitive , would represent resection Cortical region ? As functional surgery , fact inconceivable surgery result over-handicap . For reason , candidate surgery benefit complete assessment include image examination , neuropsychological assessment long-term video-EEG recording record seizures . Nevertheless , patient , assessment give u formal answer . In subject , necessary carry second step , consist invasive exploration implantation intracerebral electrode stereoencephalography ( SEEG ) . Due temporal spatial resolution , SEEG allow , besides precise determination EZ , carry functional mapping cortical region likely include cortectomy . Conventionally , map carry basis cortical electrical stimulation apply implanted electrode . If approach robust explore primary function motor skill language , used evaluate complex cognitive task face recognition attention Effective cognitive treatment daily basis . This lead development recent year , Lyon Grenoble , complementary approach cerebral stimulation : dynamic spectral imaging ( ISD ) . Numerous experimental paradigm demonstrate realization cognitive task associate generation within cortical region involve treatment particular cortical activity . This activity characterize oscillation cortical rhythm high frequency ( &gt; 30 Hz ) , call gamma activity . The ISD thus consist map gamma activity various cognitive task , thus make possible study widely complexity cognitive function . Correlations gamma activity cognitive task far exclusively perform non-epileptic cortex explore periphery EA SEEG . Nevertheless , cortical oscillatory pattern study associate specific cognitive task within EZ could better anticipate complex cognitive deficit could generate resection cortical region . The main objective project establish predictive character gamma cortical oscillatory pattern associate specific cognitive task risk occurrence cognitive disorder surgery epilepsy .</brief_summary>
