	<brief_summary>Phase I study hypothesis Pulsed Low Dose Radiation ( PLDR ) radiation delivery technique significantly decrease rate severe acute esophagitis patient receive concurrent Chemo-radiation therapy ( CRT ) non-small cell lung cancer esophageal cancer maintain similar efficacy . For patient , rate severe acute esophagitis concurrent CRT high ( approximately 20 % ) conventional external beam radiation utilize . Severe acute esophagitis cause many adverse consequence severe discomfort , weight loss , hospitalization , interruption/early termination treatment , bad surgical complication receive surgery CRT . PLDR radiation potential maintain tumor control rate conventional radiation decrease toxicity surround normal tissue 29-35 . We complete accrual phase I PLDR radiation study , patient receive palliative re-irradiation PLDR technique metastatic disease previous irradiated field . In phase I study , PLDR demonstrate safety acute toxicity set re-irradiation total dose 50 Gy , analysis 60 Gy pending . The follow time phase I study limited enrol patient short overall survival due terminal illness . This proposed phase I study , knowledge , first clinical study combination PLDR radiation concurrent chemotherapy definitive treatment .</brief_summary>
