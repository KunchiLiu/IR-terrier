	<brief_summary>Approximately 80 male female patient document solid tumor malignancy epithelial origin locally advance metastatic , either refractory standard therapy standard therapy available , enter Phase 1a/2a , multicenter , open-label , dose-escalation , cohort study AVID100 , anti-human EGFR monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) link maytansinoid DM1 . The initial Phase 1a Dose-Escalation portion trial ( approximately 30 patient ) design evaluate safety tolerability , well identify DLT ( ) , MTD , RP2D sequential escalating dos AVID100 ( study drug ) , administer patient tumor reasonably likely express EGFR ; secondary objective include characterization PK profile total antibody ( AVID100 plus MAB100 ) , AVID100 , DM1 , well preliminary assessment antineoplastic activity AVID100 . Once MTD and/or RP2D identify , 3 expansion cohort patient ( approximately 50 patient total ) measureable disease confirm EGFR-positive tumor ( tumor type determine ) accrue subsequent Phase 2a Dose-Expansion portion trial goal evaluate safety , tolerability , antineoplastic activity AVID100 administer RP2D ; secondary objective characterize PK profile total antibody , AVID100 , DM1 ( PK evaluation less extensive Phase 2a compare Phase 1a ) . An exploratory objective Phase 1a Phase 2a portion trial evaluation utility potential biomarkers response predictor AVID100 activity FFPE tumor tissue ( optional Phase 1a patient , require Phase 2a patient ) . Patients treat followed outpatient basis throughout trial , unless hospitalization require reason , assure patient safety .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>On Day 1 study , patient receive study drug administer 1-hour IV infusion fix 100 mL volume . AVID100 administer every 3 week ( Q3W ) administration Day 1 first week , follow 3-week recovery period . This 3 week ( 21 day ) period consider Cycle 1 . In Phase 1a , determination regard cohort escalation , DLTs , MTD base toxicity observe initial cycle . Patients must receive full plan dose AVID100 , plus complete designate follow-up period , order consider evaluable tolerability , unless dose reduction , interruption , discontinuation result DLT . In patient enter , minimum least Cycle 1 study complete , tolerate , , absence document disease progression unacceptable toxicity , patient may continue receive additional cycle study drug Q3W ( + 2 day ) , dose infusion duration establish patient Cycle 1 , schedule . These additional 3 week cycle may continue , tolerate absence document disease progression , Investigator 's discretion , provide specify retreatment criterion meet . Evidence progressive disease point study necessitate withdrawal patient participation alternative management malignancy may consider .</detailed_description>
