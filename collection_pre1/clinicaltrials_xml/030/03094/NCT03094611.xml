	<brief_title>Study Low Dose Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Patients With Relapsed Refractory CD22 Positive Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : There 28 ( +/- 7 ) day cycle . If participant find eligible take part study , receive study drug vein 1 hour Days 1 , 8 , 15 cycle . If participant 's doctor think need , may also receive drug spinal tap ( intrathecally ) help low risk disease come back fluid surround brain . Participant may give drug help decrease risk side effect . Participant 's doctor tell drug , give , possible risk . Length Treatment : Participant may receive 6 cycle treatment . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . If disease get bad respond least 3 month , participant may able retreat 6 additional cycle . Participant continue study visit describe . The study doctor discus option participant . Participant still risk side effect due study drug . This could also delay start treatment . The disease may also get bad point participant longer able receive treatment . Study Visits : Before treatment cycle , participant physical exam . One ( 1 ) time weekly Cycles 1-6 , blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Days 14 21 Cycle 1 , every 2-3 cycle , participant bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration . This investigational study . Inotuzumab ozogamycin FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 48 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
