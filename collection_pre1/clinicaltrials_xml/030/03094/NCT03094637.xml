	<brief_title>Azacitidine Pembrolizumab Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 4 week ( 28 day ) . - Participant receive azacitidine either vein 10-40 minute injection skin Days 1-7 cycle . - Participant receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute Day 1 Cycle 1 , every 3 week . Length Study : Participant receive study drug long doctor think participant 's best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Participation study long-term follow-up period . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 , within 72 hour first dose study drug , participant able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . On Day 1 Cycle 1 every 3 week , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test dose pembrolizumab . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 Day 1 every cycle : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Between Days 22-28 Cycles 1 3 1 time every 3 cycle , participant bone marrow biopsy aspirate check status disease cytogenetic testing . If participant 's doctor think need , point study , participant may additional bone marrow biopsy aspiration . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . Follow-Up : About 30 day participant 's last dose study drug , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . If participant stop take study drug reason disease get bad , every 12 week : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - Participant bone marrow biopsy aspirate check status disease . If disease get bad participant stop receive study drug begin receive treatment , participant call every 12 week participant leaf study , end study , whichever occur first . This investigational study . Pembrolizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment melanoma non-small cell lung cancer . Azacitidine FDA approve commercially available treatment MDS . The use study drug combination investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 40 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
