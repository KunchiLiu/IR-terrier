	<brief_summary>This study aim test accuracy total thoracic fluid content ( TFC ) measure cardiometry predict weaning-induced pulmonary edema subsequently weaning failure . Area receiver operate characteristic curve ( AUROC ) determine , sensitivity , specificity , best cutoff value calculate TFC prediction wean failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Total Thoracic Fluid Content Prediction Failure Weaning From Mechanical Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Weaning mechanical ventilation serious challenge process critical care practice . Weaning failure associate poor patient outcome . Increased mortality patient fail wean due development complication relate re-intubation . Detection correction cause fail spontaneous breathe trial ( SBT ) help intensive improve outcome next trial . Fluid overload positive cumulative fluid balance risk factor wean failure . Weaning induce pulmonary edema ( WIPE ) report cardiac non-cardiac patient . Many tool prediction wean induced cardiac edema report . The gold standard detection WIPE pulmonary artery catheter . More simple tool investigate detection WIPE patient without previous cardiac dysfunction extravascular lung water , B-natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) level , biological sign hemoconcentration . Although measurement extravascular lung water reliable tool prediction WIPE , disadvantage need advance monitor invasive arterial line . Bioreactance new technology use measurement cardiac output total thoracic fluid content ( TFC ) . More recently , electrical velocimetry new technology good performance cardiac output monitoring . The use electrical velocimetry measurement TFC advantage non-invasive need advance skill . The aim work validate use TFC ( measured electrical velocimetry ) extravascular lung water ( measure lung ultrasound ) prediction wean success .</detailed_description>
