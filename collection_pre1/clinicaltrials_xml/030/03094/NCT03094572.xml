	<detailed_description>Half stroke patient physical disability . These disability combine sensory motor deficiency ( control deficit , syncinesia , tone disorder ) cause disruption upper extremity ( UE ) function ( orientation , UE length adjustment grip ) . The human spinal cord circuitry ( HSCC ) participate motion regulation . Roche et al . study healthy subject HSCC modification visuo-motor regulation object clamp force hand ( Roche et al. , 2011 ) . The author show learn task single session associate HSCC modification , specific depend HSCC accord visual biofeedback associate task . Diserens et al . show also rhythmic movement UE pedaling cause decrease spasticity hemiplegic subject ( Diserens et al. , 2007 ) . Moreover , HSCC modification dependent task perform ( Zehr , 2005 ) . The rhythmic ball-bouncing virtual environment visuo-motor task rhythmic kinematic already study healthy subject ( Siegler et al. , 2010 ) . To knowledge , present study first investigate HSCC modification hemiplegic subject perform rhythmic kinematic task UE . We hypothesize task lead HSCC excitability specific modification cervical spinal cord lead improvement motor capability subject . The general objective determine modification nature induce UE kinematic rhythmic task realization cervical HSCC , research break four study . Study 1 identify influence visual feedback change HSCC excitability voluntary group . In first study , 16 voluntary subject perform visuo-motor task dominant UE control task ( without visual feedback ) dominant UE . Study 2 investigate impact UE laterality perform task change HSCC excitability voluntary group . In second study , 16 volunteer subject perform visuo-motor task dominant UE visuo-motor task non-dominant UE . Study 3 objectify effect type contraction muscle involve task change HSCC excitability volunteer group . In third study , 16 voluntary subject perform visuo-motor task dominant UE perform either elbow flexion-extension flexion-extension wrist . Finally , study 4 study effect pathology motor strategy use change HSCC excitability . In latter study , 16 hemiplegic patient perform visuo-motor task paretic UE spontaneous motor strategy . The obtained knowledge could open new prospect rehabilitation cerebro-injured subject addition exist therapeutic ( Ferris et al. , 2006 ) .</detailed_description>
