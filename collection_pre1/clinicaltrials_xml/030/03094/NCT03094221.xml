	<brief_title>Clinical Utility Validation Rhythmia Mapping System Treatment Cardiac Arrhythmias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite advancement catheter ablation technology past decade , essential step therapy entail identification accurate mapping arrhythmia mechanism anatomical substrate . These perform assistance map system catheter able record high fidelity local electrical activity heart ( electrogram , EGM ) display three-dimensional view . Current map system limit slow incomplete arrhythmia mapping , limit successful therapy . The Rhythmia™ Mapping System ( Rhythmia ) , include novel basket catheter ( IntellaMap Orion™ High Resolution Mapping Catheter ) , FDA approve map system available use clinical , standard care electrophysiology procedure BIDMC . Its unique design allow improve mapping resolution cardiac arrhythmia , particularly complex disease substrate , atrial ventricular tachycardia . Specifically , investigator plan enroll patient undergo electrophysiology study ablation atrial flutter/fibrillation , atrial tachycardia ventricular tachycardia . The system develop provide high-resolution map base rapid , automated acquisition large number low noise electrograms . This mapping system design improve speed clinical outcome system rapid automated acquisition capability . The Rhythmia mapping system FDA approve make available use clinical procedure BIDMC . Rhythmia instal one three electrophysiology lab BIDMC use system discretion electrophysiologist perform procedure . Thus , use use Rhythmia system guide arrhythmia map ablation deviation standard care . The goal registry study examine clinical utility system create accurate electroanatomical map validate data acquire compare historical cohort electroanatomical signal correspond map create traditional Carto®3 electroanatomic mapping system ( Biosense Webster , Inc ) . Patients approach enrollment treat physician elect utilize Rhythmia mapping system standard clinical procedure . The data acquire collected member research team clinical registry offline analysis . The aim/hypotheses test study include : - The Rhythmia mapping system result creation accurate , high resolution 3D electroanatomical map , define ability successfully map arrhythmia circuit ( yes/no ) ablate arrhythmia ( yes/no ) . - The time create electroanatomical map Rhythmia mapping system significantly shorter historical cohort use traditional Carto®3 system .</detailed_description>
