	<brief_summary>Cognitive functional impairment debilitate problem survivor major surgery . Efforts modify medical treatment prevent impairment ongoing may yet yield significant benefit . An area need study whether build patient ' cognitive physical reserve prescribe program cognitive physical exercise physiological insult ( prehabilitation effort ) improve long-term outcome . Prehabilitation effort surgery thus far focused preemptive physical therapy improve post-surgical functional outcome . No work , however , do attenuate cognitive decline commonly see surgical illness exercise brain surgical insult . Cognitive prehabilitation novel therapeutic approach apply well-understood technique derive brain plasticity research . Our approach bolster data demonstrate cognitive training program effective high likelihood foster improvement patient outcome across range population . It yet know program improve cognitive reserve , allow patient ' mind well manage acute stress surgery hospitalization . The primary aim pilot study evaluate feasibility cognitive physical prehabilitation training adult patient undergo major non-cardiac surgery risk postoperative cognitive functional decline . The secondary aim study effect cognitive physical prehabilitation training cognitive ability , functional status , quality life surgery .</brief_summary>
