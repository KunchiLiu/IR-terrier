	<brief_summary>The proximal interphalangeal ( PIP ) joint second joint finger finger tip . The outcome follow replacement surgery joint consider unsatisfactory . In order improve outcome , would helpful understand geometry joint , move force involve . This achieve use computer model model bone soft tissue - musculoskeletal model . In order make model representative possible , generate use anatomical data . Data initially extract patient ' exist magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan . This enable computer model begin construct . In parallel model initialisation , anatomical motion data PIP joint healthy volunteer collect . The necessary data collect use CT MRI scan , well optical motion track method . These data use populate musculoskeletal model . Once model construct , use simulate motion joint look effect simulate PIP joint replacement . This information provide insight PIP joint replacement might improve future .</brief_summary>
