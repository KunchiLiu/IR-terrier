	<brief_summary>This study evaluate toxicity profile neratinib combination trastuzumab patient early stage breast cancer use anti-diarrheal prophylaxis . The anti-diarrheal medication test trial loperamide crofelemer . Crofelemer anti-diarrheal , enteric-coated drug product oral administration . It botanical drug currently approve FDA oral administration approve treatment diarrhea associate HAART . Crofelemer novel mechanism action , act directly simultaneously 2 distinct intestinal luminal chloride channel . It inhibitor cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) -stimulated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) chloride ion ( Cl- ) channel find apical membrane , calcium-activated Cl- channel ( CaCC ) luminal membrane enterocytes . The CFTR Cl-channel CaCC regulate Cl fluid secretion intestinal epithelial cell . Crofelemer act block Cl- secretion accompany high volume water loss diarrhea , normalize flow Cl- water GI tract .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diarrhea Prophylaxis Patients With HER2+ Breast Cancer Treated With Trastuzumab Neratinib , Followed Neratinib Monotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label adjuvant/post neoadjuvant single arm phase 2 trial . Patients receive : Neratinib 240 mg orally day 52 week receive concurrent trastuzumab . After completion trastuzumab maintenance therapy ( determined treat physician ) , neratinib continue monotherapy 12 month . Neratinib take continuously 21-day cycle rest cycle unless related toxicity . Intensive daily loperamide prophylaxis first 2 cycle need . Crofelemer 125 mg bid first two cycle need . Each cycle 21 day . Clinic visit laboratory study plan day 1 every cycle first 4 cycle , q4 cycle thereafter . An end treatment visit occur 28 day last dose neratinib . Patients permanently discontinue treatment due unacceptable toxicity followed-up 28 day last dose neratinib .</detailed_description>
