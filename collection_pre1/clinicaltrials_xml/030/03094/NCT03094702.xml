	<brief_summary>The SPRINT study use blood pressure measurement procedure differs earlier study arterial hypertension . SPRINT type reading low regular office measurement . The extent disagreement SPRINT office measurement may differ distinct patient group . This difference yet know patient renal transplantation . However , important know difference order apply SPRINT finding transplant recipient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SPRINT Trial Type Blood Pressure Measurements Patients After Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most clinical trial treatment arterial hypertension use office blood pressure measurement ( Franklin et al . 2001 ; Hansson et al . 1998 ) inclusion criterion study end-points . In trial , blood pressure take manual automated device outpatient come study center , recommend European Society Cardiology/European Society Hypertension ( ESC/ESH ) Guidelines management arterial hypertension ( Mancia et al . 2013 ) . The target blood pressure recommend European ( Mancia et al . 2013 ) US ( James et al . 2014 ) guideline largely depend result Hypertension Optimal Treatment ( HOT ) study ( Hansson et al . 1998 ) . This large trial &gt; 18.000 participant measure blood pressure oscillometric device three time row seated patient 5min rest . This similar trial form backbone knowledge consider normal blood pressure blood pressure level aim use antihypertensive treatment ( Zanchetti et al . 2009 ) . Studies use 24h-blood pressure measurement device indicate normal value low ( average 10/5mmHg ) technique regular office measurement ( Head et al . 2010 ) . It well know call `` white coat '' hypertension , i.e . high blood pressure value take doctor 's office home ( Mancia et al . 1987 ) . The amount white-coat effect largely different individual . Although white-coat hypertension prognostic impact patient ( Verdecchia et al . 2005 ) much less relevant overt hypertension . It seem reasonable keep White coat effect mind avoid over-therapy patient effect particularly strong . While framework clinical decision make mostly base study use office blood pressure reading , SPRINT study ( Wright et al . 2015 ) recently use another way measure blood pressure . The SPRINT study include 9.300 cardiovascular high-risk individual without diabetes mellitus . It randomize prospective trial intervention aim low ( &lt; 120 mmHg ) vs. standard ( &lt; 140 mmHg ) systolic blood pressure . The trial stop early large benefit intervention combine cardiovascular end-point . Since publication study , vivid scientific discussion whether low blood pressure goal aim different patient population . The SPRINT study use unique way determine blood pressure . Patients leave alone quiet room program blood-pressure reading device take reading interval 5 minute relax . Recent study show blood pressure read take SPRINT technique relevantly low reading regular office blood pressure measurement ( Wohlfahrt et al . 2016 ) . Patients renal transplantation frequently arterial hypertension ( Kasiske et al . 2004 ; Paoletti et al . 2009 ) . This part induce kidney disease effect transplant immunosuppressive therapy ; thus might consider form secondary hypertension . The KDIGO guideline ( KDIGO clinical practice guideline care kidney transplant recipient 2009 ) recommend maintain blood pressure &lt; 130/80 mmHg patient . This recommendation base analogy data general population formally proven transplant patient . In order determine SPRINT result extrapolate transplant recipient well , important show effect size different blood pressure measurement technique ( SPRINT vs. regular office BP ) particular patient group . The study intend quantify difference blood pressure read regular ( `` real life '' ) measurement SPRINT procedure ( primary goal ) . In addition study describe factor influence difference ( e.g . renal function , proteinuria , age , time since transplantation ... ) ( secondary goal ) .</detailed_description>
