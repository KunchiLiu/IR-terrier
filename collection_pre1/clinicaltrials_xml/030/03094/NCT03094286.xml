	<detailed_description>PD-1/ PD-L1 coinhibitory pathway play significant role regulation immune response chronic infectious disease cancer . Preclinical animal data support safety promise activity anti-PD-1 antibody HIV-1 infection . Demonstrated anticancer activity safety profile durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) cancer clinical trial . Unlikely drug interaction durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) antiretroviral treatment . The proposal phase II clinical study design assess feasibility durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) HIV-1-infected individual solid tumor . Additionally , obtain data let understand possible benefit treatment cancer patient HIV infection , explore activity durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) could high cancer produce least part due chronic immunosupression . Simultaneously , allow u investigate effect disrupt immunoregulatory pathway might reverse cancer pathways HIV-specific T-cell function persistent chronic HIV infection human . In regard , hypothesis : HIV patient cancer similar outcome term tolerability treat durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) monotherapy recommend dose non HIV infect patient .</detailed_description>
