	<brief_summary>Despite advance stroke rehabilitation , post-stroke upper extremity impairment still major challenge . Increasing evidence find support stimulation afferent receptor enhances neuroplasticity brain . Studies suggest multisensory stimulation could promote motor learn re-establishing disrupt sensorimotor loop due stroke enhance neuroplasticity . The objective study examine effect multisensory stimulation upper-extremity motor recovery self-care function stroke patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Multisensory Stimulation Upper Extremity Motor Recovery Stroke Patient : Preliminary Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke patient refer occupational therapy division geriatric day hospital recruit randomly assign multisensory therapy group conventional training group . The Multisensory therapy group receive 12 week ( two sessions/ week ; 90 minutes/session ) training . Each session begin 15 minute sensory stimulation ( cold vibration ) , 45 minute motor train 30 minute self-care training . The conventional training group include 12 week ( two sessions/ week ; 90 minutes/session ) training . Each session include 60 minute upper extremity motor practice 30 minute self-care training . Outcome measure include : Brunnstrom 's stage , Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale Functional Test Hemiplegic Upper Extremity use upper limb motor control function ; Manual muscle test use muscle strength . The modified Barthel Index use self-care performance</detailed_description>
