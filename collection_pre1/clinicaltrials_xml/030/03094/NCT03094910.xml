	<detailed_description>Raynaud 's phenomenon : Raynaud 's phenomenon define vasospasms occur finger , toe , nose , ears tongue last minute hour . The attack vasospasms provoke cold exposure stressful emotion present well demarcate pallor skin may include desensitization discolored area . Then cyanosis eventually redness occur due post ischemic hyperemia , also give rise paresthesia pain . The phenomenon divide primary , idiopathic form - Raynaud 's disease - represent 90 % case Raynaud 's phenomenon , see primarily patient less 40 year , usually consider benign . While secondary form often associate rheumatic disorder scleroderma , also see connect disease , include vibration injury , external compression ( e.g . neck rib ) , medication , vascular disorder atherosclerosis . The prevalence Raynaud 's phenomenon varies among study accord diagnostic criterion geography climate affect occurrence : In Northern Europe 15-20 % population affect prevalence 2-5 % Southern Europe . An increased prevalence migraine , chest pain , include Prinzmetal 's angina , demonstrate patient Raynaud 's disease . A study 3,442 participant find association Raynaud 's disease cardiovascular disease , include ischemic heart disease , intermittent claudication , heart failure cerebrovascular disease . Furthermore , increase mortality find Caucasian patient Raynaud 's disease . Consequently , Raynaud 's disease might sign precursor cardiovascular disease . Documentation Raynaud 's phenomenon : Infrared thermography method detecting infrared energy convert video signal . The method non-invasive ; fact method require contact camera investigate object . Previously , method compare reference method demonstrate Raynaud 's phenomenon evaluate extensive review . Infrared thermography gentler potentially sensitive method demonstrate Raynaud 's phenomenon . It may replace method systolic blood pressure cold provocation result less unpleasant examination patient . The nervous system : The exact mechanism Raynaud 's phenomenon yet clarify . However , sympathetic nervous system play important role process . A lack habituation sympathetic response sound stimulus demonstrate patient Raynaud 's disease compare healthy participant demonstrate normal habituation . Furthermore , sensitization physiologic response cold propose , advocate altered central control peripheral nervous system . A certain hyperactivity sympathetic nervous system demonstrate patient Raynaud 's disease , support theory autonomic abnormality might accompany Raynaud 's disease . 123I-MIBG scintigraphy : The cardiac sympathetic activity visualize radio tracer , norepinephrine-analogue metaiodobenzylguanidine ( MIBG ) mark Iodine-123 . An increased activity sympathetic nervous system visualize decrease late heart/mediastinum ratio increase washout rate . This method widely apply clinical setting , primarily employ research project involve patient heart failure whose sympathetic nervous system chronically hyperactive lead progression heart failure . However , demonstrate method also able visualize abnormal sympathetic nervous activity patient preserve ejection fraction , distinguish reversible irreversible cardiac autonomic neuropathy diabetic [ 15 ; 16 ] , act sensitive marker autonomic dysfunction patient Parkinson 's disease . Autonomic dysfunction : Diabetes Mellitus Parkinson 's disease often give rise autonomic dysfunction . Cardiac autonomic neuropathy ( CAN ) type abnormal autonomic nervous function precipitate abnormal heart frequency blood pressure . CAN present approximately 20 % diabetic . In 1970s , David Ewing develop various test demonstrate autonomic dysfunction diabetic . The relation sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system demonstrate analyze heart rate variability ( HRV ) rest . This simple measure alter cardiac autonomic control seem good predictor cardiovascular disease . Initially , CAN cause increased heart frequency due decrease parasympathetic activity . Subsequently , sympathetic tone decrease ; heart frequency decrease accordingly remain stable without normal variability . With progression CAN lead increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Glaucoma : The relationship normal-pressure glaucoma autonomic dysfunction measure perimetry heart rate variability , respectively , evaluate study parasympathetic activity find decrease , sympathetic activity well interrelate ratio increase patient normal-pressure glaucoma compare healthy age-matched participant . These finding indicate sympathetic activity patient normal-pressure glaucoma raise normal . Purpose project : The overall purpose project elucidate peripheral central part autonomic nervous system demonstrate contribution different diseases - disease generally perceive either peripheral central origin . The investigation do mean thermography , tilt table test , blood sample , physiological test , scintigraphy heart , test tactile sensitivity . For example , Raynaud 's disease vasospasms finger toe main feature . However , literature seem association peripheral attack vasospasms organ heart brain , assumingly cause Prinzmetal 's angina migraine , respectively . Furthermore , certain hyperactivity sympathetic nervous system Raynaud 's disease report literature study . While 123I-MIBG demonstrate able detect sympathetic hyperactivity various patient , supposedly , 123I-MIBG never perform patient Raynaud 's disease . Abnormal finding apply method well autonomic test Ewing patient would strong indication general imbalance cardiac autonomic nervous system . Ultimately , question general perception Raynaud 's disease harmless condition . An association autonomic dysfunction could link Raynaud 's disease increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality suggest patient literature . Objectives : The overall objective project partly implement method infrared thermography new method detect Raynaud 's phenomenon , partly investigate whether Raynaud 's disease part generalize autonomic neuropathy give rise peripheral vasospasms . During project , cardiac autonomic nervous system investigate patient Raynaud 's phenomenon , patient diagnose autonomic dysfunction well patient normal-pressure glaucoma similarly patient Raynaud 's disease supposedly increase sympathetic activity . Additionally , project include epidemiologic study base data obtain e.g . National Patient Registry Raynaud 's phenomenon pair condition diabetes mellitus , Parkinson 's disease , glaucoma , cardiovascular disease attempt estimate respective relationship Raynaud 's phenomenon . Subjects method : Participants : The project involve follow group participant : 1 . Patients primary Raynaud 's phenomenon/Raynaud 's disease 2 . Patients secondary Raynaud 's phenomenon , primarily vibration-induced 3 . Patients suspect Raynaud 's phenomenon , refer examination 4 . Patients diabetes mellitus 5 . Patients Parkinson 's disease 6 . Patients normal-pressure glaucoma 7 . Healthy participant , preferably age- gender-matched respective group patient To able obtain statistical power , 20 patient include group 1-6 . Some group dominate certain gender and/or age range . Accordingly , 40 participant recruit group healthy participant ( group 7 ) able match group age gender . Examinations : The project consist various examination describe . Infrared thermography , physiological examination , sensitivity test , blood sample perform group participant . In addition , 123I-MIBG perform patient Raynaud 's disease . 1 . Infrared Thermography This method able detect Raynaud 's phenomenon record ability finger recover baseline temperature cool . Initially , baseline temperature hand record take thermographic picture . The participant 's hand immerse cold water ( 10 °C ) 1 minute , infrared camera record temperature recovery video sequence . The temperature recovery analyze least 10 different variable ( curve analysis visual inspection ) . 2 . Physiological examination All patient examine apply - Ewing 's test : Deep breathing , Valsalva maneuver , active standing , sustain handgrip . During test , heart rate blood pressure measure continuously . - Five minute rest continuous measurement heart rate blood pressure . - Tilt table test After rest supine position patient tilt 60° 15 minute heart rate blood pressure measure continuously . Blood sample draw tilt order analyze hormonal stress response . 3 . Sensitivity test Sensitivity vibration finger examine use Vibrosense Meter® . Vibration seven different frequency apply finger , alternate intensity , threshold vibration patient assess participant remove his/her finger button vibration longer perceptible . 4 . Blood sample On day examination blood sample draw via Department Clinical Biochemistry . These blood test intend rule possible differential diagnosis abnormal physiological sensitivity test . The blood sample assay hemoglobin , long-term blood sugar , C-reactive protein , sodium , potassium , magnesium , albumin , TSH , vitamin B D , ionized calcium . Patients suspect Raynaud 's disease test anti-nuclear antibody ( ANA ) screen underlie rheumatic illness . Blood sample also draw tilt table test assayed plasma catecholamine . At time , sample plasma serum drawn possible future analysis . A research biobank create purpose . 5 . 123I-MIBG 123I-MIBG scintigraphy perform patient Raynaud 's disease visualize whether cardiac sympathetic nervous system fact affect disease .</detailed_description>
