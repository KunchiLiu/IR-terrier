	<brief_summary>Cognitive disorder major problem patient epilepsy . One hypothesis anomaly EEGs ( AIC ) may responsible short period attentional fluctuation cause reduction intellectual efficiency patient . In project , propose evaluate impact AIC cognitive performance , specifically attentional performance ( central parameter cognitive functioning ) use computerized cognitive test ( call STABILO , detail ) measure , good temporal sampling , level attentional engagement patient relation EEG activity . The originality study lie synchronization two examination usually make independently ( EEG psychometric test ) , respect precise temporal coupling . The aim provide clinician tool assess quickly attentional fluctuation epileptic patient , assess potential impact AIC occurrence change , possible therapeutic implication ( treatment AIC / specific treatment attention deficit disorder ) . The main objective study ass whether presence AIC EEG induce weaken attentional performance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cognitive disorder major problem patient epilepsy . A hypothesis support several author postulate abnormal EEGs ( AIC ) may responsible short period attentional fluctuation cause reduction intellectual efficiency patient . Indeed , attention central parameter human cognition , condition performance welfare virtually area activity . In project , propose evaluate impact AIC cognitive performance , specifically attentional performance ( central parameter cognitive functioning ) use computerized cognitive test ( call STABILO , detail ) measure , good temporal sampling , level attentional engagement patient relation EEG activity . The originality study lie synchronization two examination usually make independently ( EEG psychometric test ) , respect precise temporal coupling . The aim provide clinician tool assess quickly attentional fluctuation epileptic patient , assess potential impact AIC occurrence change , possible therapeutic implication ( treatment AIC / specific treatment attention deficit disorder ) . This study consist scalp EEG detect , real time , base measurement reaction time accuracy response ( record every two second ) , level attention give participant repetitive task constant difficulty correlate behavioral result AIC identify EEG record . A computer equip realization STABILO test already available , connection / synchronization standard acquisition system EEG data already effective RS232 serial port . Included patient see EEG extend fifteen minute , carry computerized attention task ( This STABILO experimental protocol develop JP Lachaux V. Herbillon ) allow evaluation stability 'attention .</detailed_description>
