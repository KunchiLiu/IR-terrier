	<brief_summary>This adaptive , Phase II/III study 2 part ( i.e . Part 1 ( dose range ) Part 2 ( Hypothesis test ) ) . NaBen® grant Breakthrough Therapy Designation US FDA treatment refractory schizophrenia . Part 1 Objectives : There two primary objective Part 1 study : 1 . To evaluate , term dose-response , effectiveness NaBen® ( 1000 2000 mg/day ) compare Placebo ( 0 mg/day ) , combine clozapine , improve residual symptom associate refractory schizophrenia adult , ; determine optimal dose use Part 2 study . 2 . Sample size re-assessment evaluate final sample size need proceed Part 2 study The secondary objective Part 1 study evaluate safety tolerability NaBen® ( 1000 2000 mg/day ) compare Placebo ( 0 mg/day ) , combination clozapine . Part 2 Objectives : The primary objective Part 2 study evaluate effectiveness NaBen® ( optimal dose determine Part 1 study ) compare Placebo ( 0 mg/day ) , combine clozapine , improve residual symptom associate refractory schizophrenia adult . The secondary objective Part 2 study evaluate safety tolerability NaBen® ( optimal dose determine Part 1 study ) compare Placebo ( 0 mg/day ) , combination clozapine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase II/III , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , two-part , dose-finding , Multi-center study , subject refractory schizophrenia enrol . This study conduct two part : In Part 1 ( i.e . dose find portion ) study One hundred seventy one ( 171 ) subject randomize 1:1:1 ratio ( NaBen® 2000 mg/day : NaBen® 1000 mg/day : Placebo ) . All subject , sign Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) , assess screen phase . This screening phase design exclude subject 20 percent reduction PANSS total score use PANSS score evaluation Visit 1 Visit 2 . Only subject successfully complete screen phase still meet study eligibility criterion proceed Randomization double-blind treatment . All randomized subject receive eight ( 8 ) week randomize treatment ( NaBen® 2000 mg/day , NaBen® 1000 mg/day Placebo ) . Study treatment give twice daily . An Interim Analysis ( IA ) conduct 171 subject Part 1 study randomize complete 8 week treatment early terminate , whichever occur first . Randomization subject study continue IA Part 1 data complete . The data Part 1 analysis review independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) would assess data safety efficacy trend . The DSMC responsibility elaborate DSMC charter . The DSMC approve continuation study recommend optimal dose sample size adjustment Part 2 study . Assuming sample size adjustment make result IA , Part 2 study total 116 subject randomize 1:1 ratio , 58 subject randomize NaBen® optimal dose group 58 subject Placebo group . The procedure assessment subject Part 1 Part 2 study identical exception randomization schema .</detailed_description>
