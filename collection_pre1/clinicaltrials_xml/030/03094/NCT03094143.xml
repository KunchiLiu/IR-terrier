	<brief_summary>Aortic stenosis common valvular disease Western world . It cause progressive narrowing aortic valve lead increase strain heart muscle work increasingly hard pump blood narrow valve . Over time heart muscle thickens generate force , eventually heart fail lead death valve replace operation . No medical treatment exist stop reverse heart valve narrow . Current clinical guideline suggest operation perform symptom develop heart muscle visibly weak cardiac ultrasound scanning . However , symptom difficult interpret many patient heart muscle become irreversibly damage heart fail recover follow surgery . Using MRI scan heart , investigator identify heart scar seem develop heart muscle thickens . Several study show people develop scar likely suffer poor outcome include death . The investigator also identify clinical risk predict presence scarring . The investigator propose study patient severe aortic stenosis indication valve replacement per current guideline assess clinical risk . If participant 's risk scar high undergo cardiac MRI scan . If scarring present participant randomise routine clinical care , referral valve replacement surgery . Participants evidence scar randomise routine care study follow . The investigator study hypothesize early surgery lead few complication reduce risk death compare standard care .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Severe aortic stenosis ( aortic valve jet velocity ≥4.0 m/s , aortic valve area index body surface area &lt; 0.6cm2/m2 aortic jet velocity ≥3.5m/s ) 2 . Age 18 year 3 . No symptom attributable aortic stenosis require aortic valve replacement 1 . Deemed low risk midwall fibrosis screen 2 . Planned cardiac surgery 3 . Previous valve replacement 4 . Severe hypertension ( systolic &gt; 180 diastolic &gt; 110 mmHg ) 5 . Acute pulmonary oedema cardiogenic shock 6 . Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50 % cardiac MRI 7 . Significant abnormality cardiac MRI would prevent enrolment 8 . Coexistent severe aortic regurgitation mitral regurgitation 9 . Coexistent mitral stenosis great mild severity 10 . Coexistent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cardiac amyloidosis 11 . Any contraindication MRI scanning ( permanent pacemaker ) 12 . Advanced renal impairment ( glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) 13 . Pregnancy breast feed 14 . Patient judge unfit consider aortic valve replacement transcatheter aortic valve implantation 15 . Patient decline consider undergo valve replacement surgery transcatheter aortic valve implantation 16 . Inability give inform consent 17 . Previous randomisation study</criteria>
