	<detailed_description>This cohort study conduct patient undergone LDLT January 2015 January 2016 Ain Shams Center Organ Transplantation ( ASCOT ) . HLA Typing Mismatch : Preoperative blood sample recipient donor collect . The serological tissue type HLA perform SSP-PCR ( sequence-specific- primer ) . HLA-A , HLA- B , HLA-DR locus examine used calculate mismatch score . The locus-specific type HLA mismatch , well degree HLA mismatch , assess . For locus individually , mismatch number score 0 , 1 , 2 , basis number donor allele share respective recipient . Each patient assign overall total score depend total number mismatch 3 locus , range 0 ( mismatch loci ) 6 ( mismatch loci ) Cross matching ( total autocross ) : Crossmatch involve place recipient serum ( potentially contain donor-specific anti-HLA antibody ) onto donor lymphocyte ( contain HLA antigen ) .A cytotoxic reaction ( deem 'positive ' ) suggest presence preform DSAbs ( donor specific antibody ) . Autoantibodies generally IgM rather IgG antibody . To establish autoantibody responsible result auto-crossmatch performed . In assay , recipient serum crossmatched recipient ( rather donor ) lymphocytes . Second , original crossmatch repeat addition agent Dithiothreitol ( DTT ) . DTT reduce disulfide bond IgM thereby prevent IgM antibody generate positive result . IgM antibodies generally regarded pathological significance transplantation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Recipient selection : 1 . Adult recipient candidate LDLT due HCV relate ESLD meeting transplantation criterion Ain Shams Center Organ Transplantation ( Child Pugh score ≥ 7and MELD score ≥15 ) . Donor selection : 1 . Living donor usually close family member spouse , although unrelated living donor accept accord legal registration MOH ( ministry health ) 2 . ABO blood type compatibility 3 . Age 1850 4 . Absence previous significant abdominal surgery and/or medical problem Adult recipient underwent LDLT due cause rather HCV . Cardiopulmonary disease correct prohibitive risk surgery Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) Malignancy outside liver meet oncologic criterion cure Hepatocellular carcinoma metastatic spread Anatomic abnormality preclude liver transplantation Uncontrolled sepsis Acute liver failure sustain intracranial pressure &gt; 50 mmHg cerebral perfusion pressure &lt; 40 mmH Persistent non adherence medical care Lack adequate social support Advanced age old 65y .</criteria>
