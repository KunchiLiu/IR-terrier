	<detailed_description>The people transfemoral amputation may poor balance gait . Many people low limb loss report need concentration gait . People low limb loss may need use cognitive resource monitor control movement prosthetic limb . The need concentrate walking may great transfemoral amputation . For examine use cognitive resource , dual task paradigm may use . Dual task rehabilitative training use many patient like stroke , Multipl sclerosis osteoporosis . But study dual task training amputation . The purpose randomize control study investigate effect dual-task balance training balance gait patient transfemoral amputation compare single-task balance training . We hypothesize dual-task balance training would improve balance gait , would effective single-task balance training .</detailed_description>
