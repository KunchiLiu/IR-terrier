	<detailed_description>Obesity worldwide health sociopolitical issue . Excessive body-weight currently affect 50 % Brazilian population around 13 % world population . It well establish obesity independent risk factor . Obese individual increase risk disease earlier death compare normal weight waist circumference . The increased disease susceptibility subset patient include hypertension , stroke , hyperlipidemia , sleep apnea , Type 2 diabetes , neoplasm , GERD , musculoskeletal disorder . Obese patient physician increasingly turn surgery solve excess weight issue frequent co-morbid condition impact health quality life . Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass ( RYGB ) Laparoscopic Gastric Banding ( LGB ) comprise around 70 % weight loss procedure perform every year . They induce significant perennial weight loss reduce eliminate associate co-morbid disease , include Type 2 diabetes . Despite improvement postoperative morbidity mortality rate year , ( part due use laparoscopic approach ) , procedure still carry significant risk . Recent study show mortality rate RYGB high 1.9 % , complication associate LGB high 13 % . Nonetheless , secondary bariatric procedure due weight regain carry significant complication rate bad outcome , compare primary procedure . Consequently , less invasive technique need reduce risk . Gastric restriction important principle RYGB LGB . The OverStitchTM Endoscopic Suturing System ( Apollo Endosurgery , Inc. Austin , Texas ) approve device design endoscopic placement suture ( ) approximation soft tissue . This system offer assistant doctor ability restrict gastric pouch size approximate tissue endoluminally incisionless ( per-oral ) approach . The use system potential reduce complication associate current surgical approach still reach desire gastric restriction . The OverStitch safely use clinically great number procedure demand incisionless minimally invasive approach , include endoluminal revision post-bypass gastric stoma and/or pouch dilatation , post-bypass fistula repair , oversew marginal ulcer . Besides suture device , endoscopic method already use reduce dilated stoma . Among , ablation argon plasma coagulation ( APC ) one important since device worldly available present acceptable cost . Recent study associate APC prior endoscopic suture initial evidence support superiority association . However , literature still lack study support use APC associate endoscopic suture instead APC alone . Therefore , main focus study directly compare short long-term effectiveness safety APC versus APC plus Endoscopic Full-thickness suture OverStitch device patient suffer weight regain follow RYGB . Moreover , gut hormone regulation regard bariatric revisional procedure study recently evidence suggest hormonal change may important factor weight loss . Three important gut hormone regard weight balance ghrelin , GLP1 peptide YY . Ghrelin known hunger hormone . It produce cell gastric fundus . Glucagon-like Peptide 1 ( GLP1 ) Peptide YY ( PYY ) hormones regulate satiety produce L cell along distal intestine . Evidence bariatric show long-term ghrelin level diminish GLP PYY reach high post-prandial peak . Regarding revisional endoscopic therapy , gut hormone change never study . That also focus study secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
