	<brief_title>Correlation Between FlowMet™ Other Gold Standard Assessments Management Critical Limb Ischemia ( CLI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TRIAL OBJECTIVES 1.0 To demonstrate FlowMet effective assessment tissue perfusion compare gold standard technology patient suspect treated CLI . 2.0 STUDY DESIGN This single center , cross-sectional study subject schedule CLI assessment Rutherford score V VI . The subject evaluate baseline determination meet inclusion/exclusion criterion protocol . If subject eligible enroll trial sign informed consent form ( ICF ) schedule evaluation , enrol . Subjects undergo FlowMet , ABI , SPP , TBI , TcPO2 , angiography measurement ( perform previously ) . The correlation aforementioned standard clinical measurement FlowMet measurement assess . As ABI , SPP , TBI , TcPO2 , Rutherford score , time surgical ( ) admission , speed wound healing , angiography measurement likely change period one year follow initial FlowMet measurement , future measurement one year post FlowMet measurement ( perform standard care ) may also correlate initial FlowMet measurement ass whether FlowMet data correlate long-term patient outcome . 3.0 STUDY PROCEDURES 3.1 Randomization , Blinding Subject Identification This cross-sectional study subject treat CLI Rutherford score V VI . No randomization scheme require . 3.2 Product Equipment ( FlowMet ) All part FlowMet manufacture facility ISO 9001:2008 certification . Instruments construct ISO 9 cleanroom . All material intend contact patient 's skin construct polydimethylsiloxane ( silicone ) rubber sterilize via autoclave prior device construction . Polydimethylsiloxane widely use exist medical device show safe short-term contact , well long-term implantation ( The AMS Sphincter 800™ Urinary Prosthesis , PMA P000053 ) . Between us , polydimethylsiloxane component , addition component accidentally contact patient 's skin use , sanitize use alcohol wipe germicidal wipe , alcohoPSI Inc. Sani-Cloths , commonly use hospital bactericidal , tuberculocidal , virucidal . The FlowMet use 37 patient without adverse event University California , Irvine study tissue optical property approve overseen University California , Irvine IRB . The FlowMet evaluate , clear approve use FDA . 3.3 Details FlowMet usage Extremity perfusion measurement perform use FlowMet peripheral perfusion device . All extremity blood flow measurement collect room air inhalation . 3.3.1 . The FlowMet device place index finger right hand . Signal fidelity assure confirm presence pulse waveform one expect assure appropriate amount light detect FlowMet device . The following light intensity value acceptable : maximum intensity great 25 less 255 average subtract intensity great 20 less 175. ii . Following placement FlowMet device , period 10 second allow elapse allow transient change perfusion due device placement diminish . iii . FlowMet blood flow data record 20 second use FlowMet data acquisition software . iv . Steps i-iii repeat digit 1 2 limb diagnose suspected CLI , limb diagnose suspected CLI . All data set save , blood flow digit compute average collect data 20 second data collection period . If alternative digit use data acquisition due difference physiology , record . If subject miss aforementioned toe , tester choose different set digit change record . 4.0 STUDY PROCEDURES 4.1 Baseline Assessment The Cleveland Clinic 's standard care follow participate study subject . The following procedure conduct part baseline assessment : - Informed consent - Complete medical history - Demographics - Vital sign ( heart rate blood pressure ) , height weight - Record angiographic data study ( available ) The following procedure standard care conduct assess perfusion : - Ankle brachial pulse index ( ABI ) - Skin Perfusion Pressure ( SPP ) - Toe brachial pulse index ( TBI ) - Transcutaneous oxygen tension ( TcP02 ) - Angiography ( perform previously ) The following procedure standard care conduct assess perfusion : - FlowMet measurement subject 's hand foot/feet</detailed_description>
