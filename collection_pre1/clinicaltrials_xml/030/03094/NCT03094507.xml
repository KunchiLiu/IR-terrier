	<brief_summary>The purpose study look level three HIV medication : dolutegravir , darunavir cobicistat blood drug intake stop , order understand long drug persist blood . The study specifically look blood level three drug take every day 14 day . There two group . Participants Group 1 take dolutegravir everyday 14 day , nothing 7 day , dolutegravir darunavir/cobicistat together 14 day , nothing 7 day , darunavir/cobicistat alone 14 day . If participant go Group 2 begin darunavir/cobicistat everyday 14 day , nothing 7 day , dolutegravir darunavir/cobicistat together 14 day , nothing 7 day , dolutegravir alone 14 day . Drug level group measure day 14 , 35 56 . If participant decide take part , duration study 57 day plus screening visit take place 28 day prior start study , follow visit , take place 15 22 day last dose study medication . Eligible participant randomize ( 1:1 ratio ) group 1 group 2 . Participants study doctor know study medication participant take time study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Pharmacokinetics Dolutegravir , Darunavir/Cobocistat When Co-administered Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomise , cross-over , open label study , mean participant randomly assign different arm study receive different medication . The participant study doctor know study medication participant take time study.This study conduct single site , London . The total duration participant 's involvement study 57 day plus screen visit 28 day prior start study , follow visit 27 33 day last blood measurement . The participant ask visit clinic 14 occasion , three visit involve stay unit approximately 12 hour ( day 14,35 56 ) . Blood sample take participant throughout study measure level dolutegravir , darunavir cobicistat blood . Blood urine also collect throughout study safety analysis; ensure participant healthy take part continue take part study . The total amount blood collect participant study approximately 500ml ( pint ) . Participants provide write information study form participant information sheet allow adequate time question consider study agree participate . It responsibility investigator co-investigator obtain write informed consent prior undertaking procedure detail protocol . As part consent procedure , participant also ask consent personal detail enter TOPS ( over-volunteering protection system ) . The investigator designee provide adequate explanation aim , method , objectives potential hazard study . They also explain participant free refuse withdraw study reason without detriment future care treatment . A detailed description study visit follow : 1 . Screening visit If participant agrees take part , firstly ask sign inform consent form give copy keep . During visit follow assessment carry : • Demographic detail • Full medical , drug social history • Physical examination include weight , height , vital sign ( temperature , blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate ) • ECG • Chemistry panel • Haematology differential clot screen • HIV antibody test • Hepatitis B C screen • Urinalysis ( macro analysis ) • Drug screen ( urine ) • Pregnancy test ( urine ) WOCBP ( woman child-bearing potential ) • Registration TOPS database • Concomitant medication GP verification medical history : A medical history questionnaire send participant ' GPs verification medical history . This information review Investigator part medical history evaluation . If complete questionnaire receive GP , available information regard participant review Investigator . The Investigator assess information decide whether sufficiently confident inclusion exclusion criterion meet whether participant may enrol study . This decision must document write BEFORE participant dose . Copies send GP letter return confirmation medical history file participant 's source documentation . 2 . Baseline Visit , Day 1 Participants attend Unit morning ask fast 8 hour overnight prior attend . The following evaluation perform morning Day 1 , study medication dosing : • Vital sign ( temperature , blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate ) • Haematology differential clot screen • Chemistry panel • Urinalysis ( macro analysis ) • Pregnancy test WOCBP ( urine ) • Drug screen ( urine ) • Concomitant medication • Review adverse event ( AEs ) Blood sample collect : - Laboratory test safety - Pharmacogenetics agree part study - Platelets function ( investigate clotting work people take anti-HIV medication ) . Group1 : A Tivicay® ( dolutegravir ) tablet administer standard breakfast , make accord instruction along 240 ml water . This set nominal time dose . Subjects instructed administer Tivicay® home morning day ( 14 day total ) ( exception day 7 , 14 , drug administer PK Unit ) . Participants instruct administer study drug morning within 15 min standard breakfast.Participants give diet sheet give example standardise breakfast home study drug . They also remind take study drug unit day 14 take last dose unit day . Group2 : A Rezolsta® ( darunavir plus cobicistat ) tablet administer standard breakfast , make accord instruction along 240 ml water . This set nominal time dose . Subjects instructed administer Rezolsta® home morning day ( 14 day total ) ( exception day 7 , 14 , drug administer PK Unit ) . Subjects instruct administer study drug morning within 15 min standard breakfast.Participants give diet sheet give example standardise breakfast home study drug . They also remind take study drug unit day 14 take last dose unit day . 3 . Wash period ( Days 15 21 Days 36 42 ) : Group 1 2 From day 15 21 day 36 42 , participant ask stop taking study medication total 7 day time . These washout period . 7 ) Intensive Pharmacokinetic Visits ( Days 14 , 35 56 ) Participants admit unit morning day 14 , 35 56 remain Unit approximately 12 hour . They ask fast 8 hour overnight prior attend . The following evaluation perform morning Days 14 , 35 56 , study medication dosing : Vital sign ( temperature , blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate ) • Physical Examination ( symptom direct ) • Adherence question - Review AEs - Concomitant medication check - Haematology differential clot screen - Chemistry panel - Urinalysis ( macro analysis ) - Drug screen ( urine ) - Pregnancy test WOCBP ( urine ) - Pill count - Blood sample collect : Platelets function ( investigate clotting work people take anti-HIV medication ) . Serial blood sample take 6 occasion day ( pre-dose ( within 10 minute dose ) , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 hr later ) measure level study drug blood . A cannula place vein participant 's forearm allow repeat blood sample take without repeatedly use needle . The exact time intake study medication record CRF . Participants remain semi- recumbent position four hour post dose . Patients able leave unit 12 hour sample return follow morning . • Tail Pharmacokinetic Visits ( Day 15 , 36 57 ) Participants require attend unit plasma drug concentration sample . This occur 24 hour post dose . Participants attend day 5 , 36 57 . • Follow visit ( day 84 90 ) Participants return unit one occasion day 80 90 inclusive undergo follow evaluation : - Vital sign ( temperature , blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate ) - Haematology differential clot screen - Chemistry panel . - Concomitant medication - Review AEs 10 ) Early termination visit In case early termination , participant attend unit early termination visit within one week ( otherwise investigator believe appropriate ) . During visit follow evaluation perform : - Vital sign ( temperature , blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate ) - Haematology differential clot screen - Chemistry panel - Concomitant medication adverse event check The reason early termination participant clearly document participant 's CRF . The participant require attend follow visit unless deem necessary opinion investigator ( e.g . due adverse event follow ) .</detailed_description>
