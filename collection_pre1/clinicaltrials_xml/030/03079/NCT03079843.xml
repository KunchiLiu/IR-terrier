	<detailed_description>The investigator enroll 50 healthy nonsmoking adult ( 20-65 year old ) protocol involve 2 separate 5 day long `` study block '' . Each block consist 5 separate 2 hour-long `` exposure period '' conduct 5 day row ( Monday - Friday ; start : 8 end : 10 ) ( Table 2 : Study flow chart ) . Investigators enroll 2 patient undergo trial study block simultaneously ( one subject start block 1 active intervention wear facemask wear facemask begin block 1 ) . Day 1 ( Monday ) study block occur non-polluted clean indoor setting ( Research Exam Room , Suite A 1310 ; Lobby A , Dominos Farms ) . All subsequent exposure period ( day 2-5 , Tuesday Friday ) study block take place designate `` exposure site '' , Ann Arbor Transportation Association ( AATA ) parking lot area nearby several busy roadway Ann Arbor MI . To complete entire study , subject perform 2 separate study block . Minimal total study duration 2 week ( washout period = 2 day weekend ) maximal period 6 week ( wash period = 5 week ) . During one block , subject wear N-95 respirator facemask ( active intervention ) exposure period ( day 1-5 , even day 1 indoor exposure ) . Subjects remove mask end study day test complete . Active versus control intervention order perform randomized single-blind cross-over order . During block subject wear facemask ( control ) exposure period . While subject necessarily aware intervention type , study investigator responsible evaluate result blind intervention type data analysis ( i.e. , single blind trial ) . Throughout exposure period , subject wear ambulatory BP monitor ( ABPM ) ECG Holter monitor determine brachial BP/aortic hemodynamics measure every 10 minute heart rate variability ( HRV ) metric measure continuously average 10 minute epoch correspond time period BP level , respectively . Air pollution exposure ( PM2.5 , black carbon ( BC ) , ultrafine particle ( UFP ) count ) , ambient temperature level , noise intensity measure continuously near-roadway exposure site exposure period ( Days 2-5 ) . All environmental exposure metric also average 10 minute epoch exposure period correspond health outcome time . Following completion exposure period day 4 ( Thursday ) , subject endothelial function measure endoPAT ( RHI ) immediately post-exposures near-roadway site , lie supine rest 5 minute portable support . Patients wear facemask throughout RHI test active intervention block . On final day 5 study block , subject blood drawn . A sub-group ( n=20 ) subject ( enrol first-come basis ) SNS activity measure MSNA . After blood draw study visit day subject remove facemasks thereafter carry routine daily activity . However , subject ask deviate usual lifestyle study block . Subjects specifically direct significantly change lifestyle ( e.g. , diet , sleep pattern ) and/or routine activity ( e.g. , exercise regimen , work , commute , travel ) throughout study block .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Age 1865 year old . People older 65 year exclude impact PM2.5 BP know prior study ( include young individual ) agerelated increase BP SNS activity may alter association PM2.5 exposure thus produce heterogeneous population evaluate linkages PM2.5 health outcome . 2 . Selfreported nonsmoker ( 100 % abstinence least 1 year ) living nonsmoking household ( one living household smoke indoors ) know routine exposure air pollutant know point source home , travel occupationally ( e.g. , fume , dust , secondhand smoke ) . Smoking exposure may alter effect ambient PM2.5 health outcome . 3 . Able understand inform consent , legally provide informed consent , able participate entire duration study . 1 . Any facial hair ( beard mustache ) allow proper fitting air tight seal N95 facemask study would compromise ability mask prevent exposure . 2 . Any prior cardiovascular disease ( coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , stroke , peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) , aneurysms , revascularization ) * 3 . Prior diagnosis hypertension , diabetes , sleep apnea* 4 . Prior diagnosis chronic lung disease ( asthma , chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) ) * 5 . Prior diagnosis neurological disorder ( Parkinson 's disease , autonomic failure , peripheral neuropathy , seizure disorder ) condition discretion investigators* 6 . Prior diagnosis chronic kidney disease , type dialysis* 7 . Active history know cancer* 8 . History HIV* 9 . Being treated infection antibiotic within past month* 10 . Mental health issue ( ) include anxiety disorder , mood disorder , schizophrenia , condition discretion investigators* 11 . Prior diagnosis chronic acute medical condition ( ) discretion investigator may lead alteration baseline SNS activity , BP , insulin sensitivity thereby potentially impact association PM2.5 study outcome . 12 . Medications high BP alter BP . Any medication cholesterol ( e.g. , statin ) . Any medication alter blood glucose ( e.g. , diabetes medication ) * . 13 . Any medication counter pill may alter association ambient PM2.5 health outcome BP , SNS activity insulin sensitivity discretion investigators* . No counter pills take routine basis ( &gt; 2 time per week stand dosage ) include : antioxidant ( vitamin C , E ) , NSAIDS , fish oil supplement , folic acid supplement , multivitamin , counter pill , herb , complimentary therapy discretion investigator . These pill stop 3 month elective basis individual enter study . Other medication chronic stable condition list exclusion criterion likely influence study result take continued long dos stable 3 month prior enter study . Estrogen birth control use ( type ) long dose stable past 3 month . Medications counter drug use need basis ( Tylenol aspirin ) fine long routinely take &gt; 2 time per week ) * Planned major change lifestyle include work , activity , exercise , diet , weight course study* 14 . Screening visit BP ≥140/90 mm Hg ( measure automate office BP device BpTru ) 15 . Screening visit arm circumference ≥17 inch ( make home BP monitoring inaccurate cuff commerciallyavailable device fit ) . 16 . Screening visit pregnancy ( positive urine pregnancy test woman &lt; 50 year age ) plan become pregnant study period</criteria>
