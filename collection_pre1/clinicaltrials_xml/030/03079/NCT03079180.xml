	<brief_summary>Tendons essential structure transmit muscle force skeletal structure . A stiffer tendon transmit muscle force faster , allow faster movement . Moreover , tendon live tissue respond mechanical force change metabolism well structural mechanical property . The aim present study answer essential question remain unanswered necessary order optimize physical activity age human , thus improve quality life elderly . The main question : What minimal training intensity lead tendon adaptation ? What time-course tendon adaptation ? Does load protocol lead similar tendon adaptation different tendon ( Achilles vs Patellar ) train program lead identical tendon adaptation age ( 25yrs vs 75yrs ) ? To answer question , tendon architecture mechanical property investigate human different age apply different training intensity . The kinematic tendon adaptation due different training characteristic also investigate . The training protocol apply plantar flexor knee extensor . MRI ultrasound technique well use ankle knee ergometer allow quantification possible modification tendon architecture mechanical property ( tendon stiffness Young 's Modulus ) . This assessed vivo , use ultrasound image assess tendon displacement incremental maximal contraction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Given age population demographic , barrier exist population term exercise participation , determine level exercise intensity require time-course induce tendon adaptation paramount importance population . Therefore purpose study : 1. determine whether low intensity exercise training program ( resistance 55 % 1RM ) affect tendon architecture mechanical property age , 2. compare effect higher intensity exercise training protocol ( resistance 80 % 1RM ) match training work regard low intensity exercise training group , 3. evaluate time course tendon adaptation ( architecture mechanical property ) two training condition age , 4. compare effect identical training protocol apply two different muscle group ( triceps surae vs quadriceps muscle ) Patellar Achilles tendon adaptation . Every subject recruit ( Two group compose male age 65 85 year , one group young subject ( 18 30 year ) ) ask take part train program apply calf quadriceps muscle group legs . All subject assess 4 week start intervention program ( T-4w ) , time zero ( T0 ) every four week 12 week ( T4w , T8w ) . The investigation 4 week start train program allow use subject control . The intervention involve maximum forty five ( 45 ) minute train session 3 time per week . Subjects subject battery baseline assessment ( T-4w , T0 ) , train procedure ( T4w , T8w ) , follow 12-weeks intervention period ( T12w ) . The effect age different load intervention Achilles Patellar tendon investigate follow parameter : - Tendon mechanical property ( stiffness Young 's Modulus ) use US technique ass Achilles Patellar tendon displacement incremental maximal contraction . - Tendon architecture use MRI technique ass Achilles Patellar tendon cross-sectional area , tendon length moment arm . - Maximal voluntary contraction ( MVC ) - Muscle architecture use MRI technique . Thus data allow define optimal training intensity physical activity elderly person .</detailed_description>
