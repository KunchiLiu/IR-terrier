	<brief_summary>The ankle joint often affected injury , especially lateral sprain , often lead chronic instability . Joint mobilization technique seem influence sense joint positioning . The objective study compare mobilization technique balance athlete chronic ankle instability . A randomized clinical trial participant allocate three group : Talocrural manipulation , mobilization movement placebo assess primary endpoint secondary balance dorsiflexion range motion respectively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Two Mobilization Techniques Ankle Balance Patients With Chronic Ankle Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biodex Balance System : The unipodal stability protocol use anteroposterior laterolateral direction . The test last 20 second five level instability , level six stable level two unstable . The participant perform adaptation test system subsequently assess performance balance three test limb 10-second test . This instructed positioning evaluation , orient keep gaze previous direction ; Hands waist ; Contralateral knee flexed 90º , foot positioning reference degree platform anthropometric information provide participant . At end , result anteroposterior lateral-lateral direction general index collect . Weight Bearing Lunge Test ( WBLT ) : The WBLT consist use tape measure soil participant support evaluate first finger touch On tape distance reference wall tape measurement . Required participant performs ankle dorsiflexion CCF purpose approach knee wall avoid remove heel ground , mark . Y test : To evaluate dynamic balance reach low limb use The test balance consist evaluation participant 's performance movement anterior , posteromedial posterolateral angle value measure centimeter metric tape In Direction . The protocol perform six replicates adaptation one final repeat consider result test . For early point , reference point use support fix reference point intersection condition two direction use . It necessary participant member farthest start point without touch tape . At end seventh repetition measure value consider test result . Intervention : Participants divide three group : Thrust Group open kinetic chain ; MWM group close kinetic chain control group placebo intervention . Allocation one group randomize lot . Taken application questionnaires initial evaluation ( BBS , WBLT , Y Test ) , assays receive specific technique , reassess BBS WBLT . Talocrural manipulation : The technique talocrural manipulation consist application traction high caudal direction . Follow participant supine position two hand therapist around talocrural joint , fifth finger anterior talar region two thumb plantar area participant perform manipulation affect limb . It consider audible cavitation presence . Mobilization Motion ( MWM ) : The Mulligan® concept-mobilized manual therapy technique follow follow protocol : athlete position stretcher limb treat hip knee flexion contralateral limb knee flexion And neutral hip . With use belt hip region physiotherapist distal tibiofibular joint participant bulkhead limb belt , place two hand physiotherapist superimpose non-talus stabilization . With posterior removal physiotherapist 's hip distal end tibia fibula tractioned maintain anteriorly , request participant perform active knee flexion movement close kinetic chain order force movement ankle dorsiflexion And thus , end point purpose , mobilization hold 10 second . The patient return start point rest 20 second next mobilization . In , 4 separate mobilization . Placebo intervention : The positioning hand specific treatment condition ( Thrust MWM ) accurately reproduce , however , without movement force apply . All interaction , procedure deadline identical .</detailed_description>
