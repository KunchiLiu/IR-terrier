Objective : Therefore , high priority need investigate addition RT TACE randomize fashion determine improve survival rapidly grow poor prognosis patient population option . Methodology : TACE eligible patient HCC randomize TACE alone TACE plus radiation ( TACERT ) . They eligible standard treatment transplant resection . Primary endpoint time-to-intrahepatic-progression . Secondary endpoint response rate ( Modified RECIST criterion ) , overall survival , local failure , extrahepatic failure , toxicity , quality life economic feasibility .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transarterial Chemoembolization ( TACE ) With Without Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy ( SBRT ) Hepatocellular Carinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DETAILED OUTLINE OF RESEARCH PROPOSAL Current State Knowledge Primary liver cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , major health problem worldwide . It 5th common cancer 3rd common cause cancer death world . Eighty-five percent case occur develop country , United States Canada , fast grow cancer . General Treatment Overview : HCC tend remain within liver , therefore , cure preserve liver function possible . Surgical resection result 5-year survival rate 60 % -70 % . Liver transplantation cure cancer underlie liver disease . Four-year survival HCC within Milan criterion ( single HCC &lt; 5 cm ≤3 HCC &lt; 3 cm ) 70 % -85 % transplantation . Unfortunately , patient resectable . Transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) become mainstay treatment unresectable HCC . What make TACE relatively safe liver-unique vascular supply portal vein , whereas HCC supply almost entirely branches hepatic artery . In randomized controlled trial unresectable HCC suitable curative intent , transarterial chemoembolisation TACE compare conservative treatment . TACE induce objective response ( complete partial response ) sustain least 6 month 35 % case . Survival probabilities 1 year 2 year 82 % 63 % TACE , significantly well 63 % 27 % obtain conservative treatment . Overall survival 1 2 year also significantly good chemoembolization group 57 % 31 % vs. 32 % 11 % . However , many patient large tumours response rate decline rapidly increase size . TACE alone result 2 year overall survival 42 % , 0 0 lesion 5-7cm , 8-10cm , &gt; 10cm , respectively . Therefore , additional locally ablative treatment seek . In report , TACE plus radiation result 2 year overall survival 63 % , 50 % 17 % lesion 5-7cm , 8-10cm , &gt; 10cm , respectively . External beam radiotherapy long consider limited role treatment liver tumor . This due fact minimum dose require local ablation exceed dose would result liver toxicity . The technical development stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) , alone combination TACE , renew interest radiation HCC . This work do mainly two group , Michigan Stockholm , demonstrate delivery high dos radiation limit volume liver promise result term local control survival acceptable toxicity . Dr . Lock team one first centre initiate type work currently one large database outside asia . In addition , lead one two group Canada able dose escalate base radiobiological parameter thereby provide high possible dos within know toxicity constraint . For SBRT , advance technique use accurately deliver high total dose target small number daily fraction avoid dose delivery surround healthy structure . SBRT offer ablative radical local treatment . In total , eleven primary series report tumor response survival around 300 patient treat stereotactic body radiation therapy primary therapy HCC . The reported percentage objective response define complete partial ≥64 % 7 8 series . Median survival 11.7 32 month observe . Toxicity , base multiple case series trial , indicate treatment consider safe . The common CTC grade 3-4 toxicity elevation liver enzyme . For unresectable case , TACE SBRT use safely good efficacy separate treatment . Particularly large lesion commonly see London , outcome remain suboptimal compare surgery . Combined treatment case series show dramatic result , randomized trial compare value combine two modality . Therefore clinical study compare SBRT SBRT+TACE significant address common problem one two deadly cancer . Combined Modality Treatment RT range dos combine TACE several case cohort study . One example phase 1 dose escalation study demonstrate 62 Gy 52 Gy safe dos HCC &lt; 10 cm &gt; 10 cm , respectively , conjunction TACE . Koo et al prospectively studied 42 patient receive TACE follow RT . Survival cohort improve compare historical control group 29 patient receive TACE alone ( median survival 11.7 vs. 4.7 month ) . Four study specifically compare cohort patient receive TACE alone versus TACE+SBRT . All demonstrate significant improvement response rate overall survival . Clearly trial subject bias due non-randomized selection , possible lack generalizability Canadian patient , heterogeneous patient population . Therefore , important clinical need investigate combine RT+TACE improve outcomes rapidly grow poor prognosis patient population option . Research Design Methodology The objective demonstrate superiority SBRT addition TACE term intrahepatic disease progression versus TACE alone use randomize Phase III design . Phase I/II data publish recent data provide accurate event rate statistical estimation small sample size requirement endpoint .</detailed_description>
