	<brief_title>Device Data Predict Frailty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Technology provide new opportunity gain insight patient health manner far superior obtain routine office visit . For geriatric patient , frailty one measure , show negative correlation outcome , include hospitalization , complication follow invasive procedure , overall mortality . Methods quantify frailty highly limit somewhat controversial , largely cross-sectional nature . Efforts obtain longitudinal measure frailty use activity monitor wearable device promise , although limited patient cooperation cost . In addition therapeutic function , cardiovascular implantable electrical device ( CIEDs ) collect large amount data individual implant , accessed office visit well remotely . Importantly , data obtain passively routinely patient , require little additional effort expense . The possibility activity measure CIEDs could use evaluate frailty , well outcomes , would provide powerful tool clinician apply data science directly patient . This pilot investigation ass feasibility use CIED-derived activity data predict frailty , outcomes , old population . The investigator plan enroll subject CIEDs implant University Colorado Hospital Device clinic , analyze data assess correlation daily activity frailty measure , well cardiac clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
