	<brief_title>Effectiveness Circulating DNA Predicting Relapse Overall Survival NHL Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan prospectively involve 300 Non-hodgkin Lymphoma patient , include diffuse large B cell lymphomas peripheral T cell lymphoma without previous treatment Peking Union Medical College Hospital . The following parameter collect : age , sex , subtype , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) , Ann Arbor stage ( I-IV ) , presence B symptom , number type involve site , prognostic index include International Prognostic Index ( IPI ) DLBCLand PIT PTCL base medical record review . All patient would regular treatment follow PUMCH . During follow , treatment response evaluate contrast enhance computed tomography PET-CT . The peripheral blood would collect circulate DNA would test time diagnosis , interim treatment , end treatment , 1 year follow-up , 1.5 year follow-up , 2 year follow , 3 year follow-up disease progression relapse . TCR/BCR domain would sequence high-throughput sequencing .</detailed_description>
