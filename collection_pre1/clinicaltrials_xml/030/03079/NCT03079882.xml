	<brief_summary>Ten percent American adult , 20 million people , chronic kidney disease , advance state end stage renal disease desirably cost-effectively treated kidney transplantation . However , 20-30 % transplanted kidney fail live recipient 10 year , owe largely insufficient monitoring method . The goal propose research improve noninvasive kidney transplant monitor use new ultrasound-based imaging method call Viscoelastic Response ( VisR ) ultrasound .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VisR Ultrasound Noninvasively Monitoring Renal Allograft Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal transplantation desirable cost effective treatment end stage renal disease , 20-30 % allografts fail living recipient 10 year , prolong graft health one major unmet need transplant patient . Although graft health extend preemptive treatment prevent irreversible damage , intervention inadequately motivate current transplant monitoring method . Noninvasive method , include change serial serum creatinine level , lack sensitivity specificity . In absence reliable noninvasive biomarkers , invasive biopsy remain standard assess transplant health , surveillance `` protocol '' biopsy associate morbidity cost therefore controversial stable , unsensitized patient . The lack demonstrate , noninvasive biomarker allograft health - one identify early graft degeneration sufficient sensitivity specificity motivate appropriate biopsy enable timely intervention - represent major gap renal transplant management . To fill gap , propose re-search aim demonstrate Viscoelastic Response ( VisR ) ultrasound , novel acoustic radiation force ( ARF ) -based technology noninvasively interrogate viscoelastic property tissue , monitor renal allograft health . The investigator hypothesize vivo VisR ultrasound delineate renal allograft dysfunction earlier great sensitivity specificity serum creatinine concentration renal allograft recipient . To test hypothesis , investigator determine VisR outcome metric detect renal allograft dysfunction clinically perform serial VisR image live donor ( LD ) decease donor ( DD ) transplant recipient . Imaging result compare biopsy finding determine VisR 's ability detect dysfunction . The investigator also compare serial VisR serum creatinine outcomes term ability detect renal allograft dysfunction timeliness detection .</detailed_description>
