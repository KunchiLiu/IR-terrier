Eligible patient receive require resuscitation ( include central venous arterial line placement , endotracheal intubation hemodynamic resuscitation need ) prior ot baseline lab study perform . Subjects start study drug deliver via mechanical ventilator conceal cannister ( subject , provider outcome assessor blind treatment assignment ) . Randomization perform investigational drug service dispense appropriate study drug . During study drug administration hourly vital sign obtain methemoglobin level safety . Study drug wean 12h course 1h ( 10 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ppm 10 min ) prior discontinuation . Subjects receive standard post-resuscitation care outcome assess blind study team member ( see outcomes ) .
