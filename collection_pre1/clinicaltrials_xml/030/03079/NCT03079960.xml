	<detailed_description>Deep brain stimulation subthalamic nucleus ( STN DBS ) develop standard therapy treat refractory stage Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . The large number DBS system nowadays routinely implanted represent open loop technology . These so-called continuous DBS ( cDBS ) system relatively simple technical perspective , deliver uninterrupted high-frequency stimulation pulse train typically 24 hour day . The stimulation apply target area , like STN , without take account current level PD symptom motor state patient . Changes stimulation parameter -like pulse width , amplitude frequency- apply trained expert so-called adjustment session , usually take place clinic . This limit number adjustment session per year . This may sufficient adapt system long-term change patient 's state induce PD progress , take place month year , certainly sufficient react upon vary daily condition change even small temporal scale . Despite widely accept approach , cDBS know cause several side effect speech impairment tolerance treatment due chronic continuous stimulation , disadvantage regard energy efficiency battery life implant stimulation device . In contrast available cDBS system , would desirable adaptive DBS ( aDBS ) system , provide stimulation demand , example , reduce stop stimulation delivery period inactivity motor performance patient sufficiently high . Even though aDBS prototype report literature , investigate research context yet include clinical routine . To realize closed loop control patient 's motor symptom aDBS approach , least one information source describe motor state patient require . On one hand , information may accessible via external sensor wearable , record e.g . muscle tone , tremor , kinematic information etc . every-day situation execution specific motor task . Alternatively , information may also express specific brain signal , so-called neural marker , correlate motor state act surrogate . Informative neural marker extract several brain area different record technology . Activity subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) basal ganglion measure implantation DBS electrodes form local field potential ( LFP ) microelectrode recording ( MER ) . Signals record either stimulation , small time windows stimulation sequence , stimulation absent provide information clinically relevant motor state PD patient . Additionally , show neural signal recording via magneto- electroencephalogram ( MEG/EEG ) electrocorticogram ( ECoG ) may provide valuable complementary information compare signal obtain basal ganglion . On clinical level , motor state patient assess use part III Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS-III ) test battery . Its assessment , however , rather time consume require involvement clinician ( neurologist ) consequently full UPDRS-III score use aDBS implementation . Unfortunately , current state research , information motor behavior simply replace information collect via brain signal . The reason , relation relevant neural marker LFP MER recording , individual motor symptom ( e.g . describe UPDRS-III ) far complete require investigation . To characterize candidate neural marker , utilized surrogate motor state , important investigate two question : ( 1 ) ( How ) marker change upon apply DBS ? ( 2 ) Is change related clinical effect DBS observe e.g . change UPDRS-III score ? In context , select oscillatory component describe . The power LFP oscillatory component beta range ( 12-30 Hz ) report drop upon DBS , despite unclear causal relation action mechanism , also correlate motor parkinsonian symptom bradykinesia rigor . Furthermore , interaction band power frequency component specific PD motor symptom describe . An example relation delta gamma band power record STN dyskinetic symptom correlation high gamma band power UPDRS-III score , modulation high gamma DBS L-Dopa . Additionally , DBS stimulation also observe influence cross-frequency couple cortical-cortical , cortical-subcortical subcortical-subcortical structure . Most study effect DBS motor system informative neural marker report global effect observe group study . However , grand average finding may provide sufficient information control aDBS system individual patient . This underline many recent study field brain-computer interface ( BCI ) , informative neural signature find subject-specific , subject-specific method extract informative neural marker apply successfully . Hence propose refine level data analysis beyond level group statistic . Apart neural marker subject-specific , implicit dynamic , neural marker DBS effect , consider : - Dynamics neural marker Even within individual user single day , adaptation DBS parameter may require order compensate non-stationary characteristic display neural marker several temporal scale : ( ) On scale hour minute , due , e.g. , change wakefulness/tiredness circadian cycle . ( b ) On scale minute second , variation e.g . attention level , workload . ( c ) On even small time scale due current status motor system ( task preparation vs. task onset vs. sustain ongoing task , high force vs. precision task , isometric vs. movement task etc. ) . It must expect , individually informative neural marker , exploit realize closed-loop aDBS system , subject change informative content above-mentioned time scale scenario . - Dynamics DBS effect Depending DBS parameter ( e.g . intensity , frequency , duration , pulse shape ) stimulation pattern apply immediate past , effect onto ( 1 ) motor system onto ( 2 ) informative neural marker know persist several second minute even stimulation turn [ Bronte-Stewart et al . 2009 ] . Due washout effect DBS , stimulation strategy aDBS system probably benefit take ( short term ) stimulation history account . The duration temporal dynamic so-called washout period depend kind motor symptom study . It report longer akinesia ( minute - hour ) oppose rigidity ( minute ) . Thus hypothesize , dynamic washout effect motor symptom neural marker . The applicant proposal want make substantial step forward direction fully closed-loop aDBS system . To reach goal , necessary develop data analysis method brain signal , capable identifying aforementioned informative neural marker , utilize input decode current motor state . For task , machine learn method successfully investigate utilized context close loop BCI system . Methods develop field allow single-trial decode non-invasive EEG signal invasive signal like ECoG LPF . The machine learn method enable detection movement intention single-trial decoding imagine executed movement . Furthermore , late research applicant show , BCI approach allow even predict task performance upcoming motor task , may valuable information brain state dependent closed-loop application .</detailed_description>
