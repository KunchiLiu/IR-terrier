	<brief_summary>Patients age 5 , diagnosis hypoplastic leave heart syndrome ( HLHS ) , unbalanced atrioventricular canal ( uAVC ) , borderline leave heart undergo stag LV recruitment follow bidirectional Glenn ( BDG ) undergo BDG plan LV recruitment consider enrollment study . Those patient enrol study randomize either experimental arm control arm study . Those patient randomize experimental arm receive mesenchymal precursor cell ( MPCs ) inject directly LV endocardium LV recruitment BDG procedure . Those patient randomize control arm receive normal standard care procedure injection MPCs . It believe injection MPCs help improve chance patient single ventricle borderline leave ventricle convert biventricular circulation could improve quality life longevity palliation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , single center , safety feasibility , blind , randomize trial evaluate use MPCs child complex cardiac anatomy require surgical repair . Patients schedule undergo bidirectional Glenn ( BDG ) future plan LV recruitment , patient history BDG currently schedule undergo LV recruitment eligible . Twenty-four subject enrol , 12 MPC treatment arm 12 control arm follow 1:1 randomization schema . Randomization stratify accord surgeon assure random distribution subject surgeon . Families , biostatistician , clinical staff outside operating room , research staff complete data analysis blind randomization assignment . The PI , operate room staff , research staff assist delivery unblinded randomization assignment . Families make aware randomization assignment completion study Visit 4 , follow completion schedule assessment . Those randomized treatment arm receive MPCs inject directly LV endocardium follow clinical surgical maneuver recruit LV ( mitral valve repair , aortic valve repair , and/or resection endocardial fibroelastosis ) BDG . Those subject randomize control arm receive standard LV recruitment BDG injection . All cardiac tissue acquire part clinically indicated procedure collect enrolled subject . Most tissue sample analyze time collection ( histology H+E stain ) ; remainder bank potential future testing .</detailed_description>
