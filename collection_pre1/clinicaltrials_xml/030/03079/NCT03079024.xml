	<detailed_description>The purpose study perform double-blind randomize control trial ( RCT ) young patient recent-onset ( RO ) schizophrenia target improvement cognitive functioning within real-world treatment setting . This study perform University Minnesota Department Psychiatry 's First Episode Psychosis Program specialize Early Intervention Services ( EIS ) . The investigator compare effect web-based targeted cognitive training ( TCT ) vs. web-based general cognitive exercise ( GCE ) , deliver via portable laptop computer . The investigator examine behavioral functional change see immediately intervention well 6-month follow-up , compare treatment usual group ( TAU ) . This first study investigate cognitive enhancement young RO schizophrenia patient community mental health setting , use scalable interactive neurotechnology , first compare two distinct cognitive training approach . This study generate high impact data potential target pre-emotion downward spiral cognitive functional disability often characterize psychotic illness . It also generate valuable data relative effect two distinct cognitive training approach schizophrenia , derive different theoretical rationale , provide much-needed information efficacy target `` distributed neural system '' train model derive system neuroscience vs. `` general cognitive stimulation '' train model derive neuropsychological rehabilitation approach . The aim project base current state early psychosis research , well investigator ' experience successfully apply neuroscience-informed cognitive training schizophrenia . It abundantly clear cognitive/neural system dysfunction represent significant risk factor schizophrenia well poor prognostic indicator . Functional outcome RO schizophrenia predict level cognitive impairment baseline cognitive reserve , recent finding suggest specialize EIS program focus symptom reduction psychosocial support may robustly improve long-term outcomesâ€” indicate critical treatment target address present early psychosis intervention . Cognitive dysfunction underlie neural system inefficiency therefore one primary target pre-emptive intervention early psychosis . In study , investigator determine whether goal achieve use cognitive training deliver via portable computer , order improve functional outcome young individual RO schizophrenia .</detailed_description>
