	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) chronic , progressive eye disease . AMD one lead cause visual impairment blindness among elderly population economically developed country . Due age population , incidence prevalence AMD likely increase substantially next decade , potentially pose significant impact society . AMD complex progressive degenerative disease , genetic environmental risk factor . AMD affect out retina , retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) , Bruch 's membrane , choroid . The retina among metabolically active tissue body , part due rod , frequently discard outer segment tip , RPE , phagocytoses discard tip . The retina 's metabolism cause accumulation toxic by-product following : 1 . Energy metabolism ( oxidative stress ) ; 2 . Visual cycle modulator ( lipofuscin ) ; 3 . Local inflammation ( complement activation ) . The local inflammation , accumulation lipofuscin material within RPE , may lead drusen formation , RPE dysfunction , degeneration macular rod cone , finally lead irreversible loss vision . AMD occur two form - non-exudative `` dry '' form exudative `` wet '' form . Non-exudative AMD account 80-90 % AMD case involve diverse phenotype may include drusen and/or RPE pigmentation abnormality . Advanced non-exudative AMD characterize geographic atrophy , characterize presence expand region irreversible RPE photoreceptor loss macula . At present time , approve treatment non-exudative AMD . The clinical development therapeutic agent treatment non-exudative AMD limit slow disease progression , unsuitability commonly use efficacy endpoint visual acuity , difficulty identify subject early stage disease likely progress . Visual function testing may prove useful tool detect early non-exudative AMD . In early age-related macular degeneration , out retinal metabolism know compromise . The detection flicker stimulus impose high metabolic requirement static stimulus , . Inability detect flicker stimulus may identify early stage disease inability detect static stimulus . Early work Mayer , et.al . show AMD subject experience functional deficit mid range visual phenomenon notably 10HZ 14Hz . Phipps , et.al . find early AMD subject large deficit flicker static stimulus . Later work show flicker test base mid-range frequency show effective diagnostic reproducibility characteristic relative functional test . In addition diagnostic potential flicker stimulus , test show predictive AMD progression correlate AMD severity . Therefore , flicker test may prove useful identify early dysfunction macular performance assessment treatment future interventional clinical trial . Critical Flicker Fusion ( CFF ) type flicker test involve increase frequency flash stimulus stimulus appear static observer . The frequency critical flicker fusion occur record patient specific endpoint visual function . In study , investigate CFF across wide range luminance level , photopic scotopic range , young old subject normal ocular health . The impact age CFF threshold focus study , primary objective highlight luminance level maximum difference young old subject occur .</detailed_description>
