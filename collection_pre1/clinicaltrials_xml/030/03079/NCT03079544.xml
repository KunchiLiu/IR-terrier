	<brief_title>Social Media-based Active Self-report Incidence Outcomes Adverse Events NK/TCL Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma , nasal type , rare subtype non-Hodgkin lymphoma relatively high incidence China . L-asparaginase base chemotherapy widely use Chinese patient report improve overall response prolong long-term survival clinical trial limit patient . However , patient treat clinical trial China . Therefore real incidence adverse event treatment outcomes largely unknown . This study design evaluate incidence adverse event treatment outcomes social media-based ( www.house086.com , www.wechat.com ) self-report patient treat clinical trial .</detailed_description>
