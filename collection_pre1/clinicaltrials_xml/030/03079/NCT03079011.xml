Where available , assessment Estrogen Receptor status base recent tumor sample ; consider ERpositive , recent breast cancer tissue examine must display least 10 % cancer cell positive ER staining ; 6 . Tumor block ( primary tumor metastasis ) available ; 7 . No prior systemic anticancer therapy metastatic advanced disease ( chemotherapy , target therapy hormone therapy ) ; prior initiation LHRH agonist bonedirected agent however allow ) ; 8 . Menopausal patient patient suppressed ovarian function Women bilateral oophorectomy Postmenopausal woman , define follow criterion : Age 60 ; Age 50 59 year meet one follow criterion : Amenorrhea ≥ 24 month folliclestimulating hormone within postmenopausal range ; patient hysterectomy chemotherapyinduced amenorrhea must display folliclestimulating hormone within postmenopausal range ; Other woman , provide treat monthly LHRH analogue ( first injection perform ≥7 day treatment initiation ) willing continue receive LHRH agonist therapy duration trial ; 9 . Patients may measurable ( accord Response Evaluation Criterion Solid Tumors ( RECIST v1.1 ) measurable disease Patients blastic bone lesion eligible ; Patients pleural , cardiac peritoneal effusion meningeal carcinomatosis eligible ; 10 . Adequate organ marrow function define : Hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 G/L Platelet count ≥ 100 G/L Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN . This apply patient confirm Gilbert 's syndrome .
