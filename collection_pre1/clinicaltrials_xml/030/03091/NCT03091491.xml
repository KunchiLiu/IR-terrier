	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Nivolumab combination Ipilimumab associate superior response rate compare Nivolumab alone patient advance Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) mutation positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer fail one line standard EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor one line chemotherapy regimen . This study also aim determine predictive biomarkers response/benefit patient EGFR mutation positive NSCLC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Nivolumab Verses Nivolumab Ipilimumab Combination EGFR Mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study examine outcome nivolumab single agent versus nivolumab-ipilimumab combination patient advance EGFR+ NSCLC fail one line standard EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor ( TKI ) one line chemotherapy regimen . The use 3rd generation EGFR TKI patient acquire mutation substitute threonine ( T ) methionine ( M ) position 790 exon 20 ( T790M ) allow . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio treatment either nivolumab monotherapy ( Arm A ) nivolumab/ipilimumab combination therapy ( Arm B ) stratify accord follow factor : - Programmed Death-Ligand 1 ( PDL1 ) status : &lt; 1 % vs ≥1 % - Presence brain metastasis - Institution : National Cancer Centre Singapore , National University Cancer Institute , Johns Hopkins Singapore-Tan Tock Seng Hospital Both arm continue treatment regimen till disease progression discontinuation treatment due adverse event . Arm A patient allow cross Arm B event clear-cut disease progression . On-study tumor assessment conduct every 6 week 24 week every 12 week till clear-cut disease progression . The radiologist blind treatment arm patient randomise ensure objective response evaluation .</detailed_description>

WOCBP use adequate method avoid pregnancy 5 month ( 30 day plus time require nivolumab undergo five halflives ) last dose investigational drug Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start nivolumab Women must breastfeed Men sexually active WOCBP must use contraceptive method failure rate le 1 % per year Men receive nivolumab sexually active WOCBP instruct adhere contraception period 7 month last dose investigational product Women childbearing potential ( ie , postmenopausal surgically sterile well azoospermic men require contraception WOCBP define female experienced menarche undergone surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Menopause define clinically 12 month amenorrhea woman 45 absence biological physiological cause . In addition , woman age 55 must document serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level le 40 milliinternational unit per millilitre ( mIU/mL ) . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) receive nivolumab instruct adhere contraception period 5 month last dose investigational product . Men receive nivolumab sexually active WOCBP instruct adhere contraception period 7 month last dose investigational product . These duration calculate use upper limit halflife nivolumab ( 25 day ) base protocol requirement WOCBP use contraception 5 halflives plus 30 day men sexually active WOCBP use contraception 5 halflives plus 90 day . iii . Advanced EGFR+ NSCLC iv . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 02 performance status v. Progressed one line standard EGFR TKI one line chemotherapy ; 3rd generation EGFR TKI patient T790M mutation allow A 14day washout period require EGFR TKI patient receive last therapy recruitment A 28day washout period require chemotherapy patient receive last therapy recruitment . All drugrelated toxicity return baseline exception neuropathy , fatigue , alopecia . vi . Screening laboratory value must meet follow criterion obtain within 14 day prior randomization/registration White Blood Cell ( WBC ) ≥ 2000/µL Neutrophils ≥ 1500/µL Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^3/µL Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥ 40 mL/min ( use CockcroftGault formula ) : Aspartate Aminotransferase/ Alanine Aminotransferase ( AST/ALT ) ≤ 3 x ULN Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( except subject Gilbert Syndrome , total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL ) vii . Measurable disease , define RECIST v1.1 ; Previously irradiate lesion consider measurable disease disease progression unequivocally document site since radiation . viii .
