	<detailed_description>Using Health Action Process Approach framework , purpose study examine whether sedentary behaviour diabetes information meaningful source motivation reduce daily sit time among adult office worker . Specifically , examine effectiveness intervention guide HAPA influence participant ' pre-intentional motivational construct ( i.e. , sedentary-derived risk perception [ RP ] , outcome expectancy [ OE ] , self-efficacy [ SE ] ) intention ( GI ) reduce occupational leisure-time sedentary behaviour . This randomize controlled trial outcome variable assess immediately post-intervention . If successful , participant Experimental Group ( sedentary intervention group ) report high outcome expectancy ( OE ) regard reduce sit time , high risk perception ( RP ) regard SB diabetes risk , high self-efficacy ( SE ) reduce occupational leisure-time SB , great intention ( GI ) reduce occupational leisure-time SB post-intervention , compare participant either Attention-control Group Control Group . In addition , hypothesize participant Attention-control Group , receive information benefit physical activity , also show slightly great score pre-intentional motivational factor ( i.e. , OE , RP , SE ) behavioural intention ( GI ) Control Group base reminder moderate-vigorous physical activity important ( implies sit minimize ) . Participants Control Group expect report change sitting-related motivational factor post-intervention . This randomize control trial ( RCT ) outcome variable assess immediately post-intervention . Participants full-time adult , office worker primarily recruit large business office space . Potential participant ( estimate enrollment : 252 ) recruit Andrew Rollo , Co-Investigator , Harry Prapavessis , Principal Investigator , study . Relevant contact ( i.e. , Head Human Resources , President , Chief Executive Officer , Office Manager ) potential business interest contact via email . The email include letter information ( LOI ) recruitment poster . If individual accepts invitation participate informs researcher he/she willing facilitate aid recruitment process , face-to-face meeting arrange . During meeting , full complete study detail ( i.e. , purpose , design , method procedure ) make clear ONE individual ( i.e. , Head Human Resources , President , CEO , Office Manager ) . The individual ask email full-time employee respective office/business offer opportunity participate . In recruitment email , recruitment poster link online survey ( i.e. , include Letter Information , Informed Consent , Demographics questionnaire ) use SurveyMonkey website provide . Finally , researcher schedule ONE individual ( i.e. , Head Human Resources , President , CEO , Office Manager ) date approximately ONE WEEK LATER return office set intervention delivery post-intervention outcome assessment . Adult office-workers choose take part study complete online form survey use SurveyMonkey . Participants assure participation study voluntary , free discontinue withdraw study time , may choose skip question wish answer without effect employment status/work condition . In word , refuse participate , refuse answer question withdraw study impact employment beyond potentially receive benefit associate study participation . After view Letter Information indicate consent participate study ( click `` I agree '' survey ) , participant ask complete brief demographic questionnaire . All participant voluntarily choose participate also ask provide email address end online survey purpose randomization link baseline post-intervention data . Prior delivery intervention ONE WEEK LATER , participant randomize one three group : Control ( outcome questionnaire without slide ) , Attention-Control ( outcome questionnaire slide focus benefit moderate-vigorous physical activity ) , Experimental ( outcome questionnaire slide focus sedentary behaviour diabetes risk ) . Depending group assignment , participation take 30 minute 45 minute total . In attention-control experimental condition , participant receive information form slide show view part oral presentation deliver one two researcher . The intervention aim address component Health Action Process Approach . For experimental group , intervention material target risk perception ( RP ) relate sit present evidence support research sedentary behaviour diabetes risk ; outcome expectancy ( OE ) present research effectiveness break sedentary time improve blood sugar insulin level ; self-efficacy ( SE ) provide strategy reduce break sit time . The attention-control slide show take approach slide gear towards meet moderate-vigorous physical activity guideline . Participants randomly assign control group receive information intervention kind ask complete outcome questionnaire . Regardless group assignment , participant complete measure post-intervention ( i.e. , questionnaire measure sedentary-related pre-intentional motivational construct [ RP , OE , SE ] intention [ GI ] ) . However , participant attention-control experimental group FIRST receive information form slide show view part oral presentation deliver one two researcher . The first question assess outcome expectancy ( OE ) respect reduce daily sit time ; second question ass risk perception ( RP ) relate sit time diabetes risk ; question 3-12 assess self-efficacy ( SE ) relate reduce sedentary behaviour ; question 13-22 assess intention ( GI ) relate reduce sedentary behaviour . Question 23 ask participant AGAIN provide email address . The post-intervention outcome questionnaire administer hard copy immediately follow intervention delivery ( exception control group solely complete questionnaire ) . All response completely confidential email address destroy file study complete .</detailed_description>
