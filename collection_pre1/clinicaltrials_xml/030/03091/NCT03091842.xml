	<brief_title>Exercise Intervention Targeting Adiposity Inflammation With Movement Improve Prognosis Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect 4-month circuit , interval-based aerobic resistance exercise ( CARE ) intervention obesity-associated chronic inflammation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect 4-month CARE intervention sarcopenic obesity . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect 4-month CARE intervention breast cancer prognosis ass whether reduction chronic inflammation associate breast cancer prognosis . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 group . GROUP I : Patients undergo supervise CARE program 50 minute comprise warm 5 minute , moderate vigorous aerobic resistance exercise 40 minute , cool 5 minute 3 day per week 16 week . GROUP II : Patients undergo supervised traditional aerobic resistance exercise ( TARE ) program 80 minute comprise warm 5 minute , aerobic exercise 15 minute , resistance exercise 55 minute , cool 5 minute 3 day per week 16 week . GROUP III : Patients undergo home-based stretch program comprise one set 3-4 static stretching exercise hold 30 second 3 day per week 16 week . Patients receive instructional digital video disc ( DVD ) booklet flexibility exercise . Patients also complete weekly activity log . After completion stretch program , patient may optionally undergo CARE program group I . After completion study , patient follow week 34 , 8 12 month , every year 8 year .</detailed_description>
