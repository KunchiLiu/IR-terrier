	<detailed_description>1.0 INTRODUCTION The association parathyroidectomy cardiovascular status improvement still inconclusive . There evidence suggest primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHPT ) associate hypertension , whereas study show hypertension reverse surgical care . Moreover , leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) consider linearly associate parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) independent hypertension . In addition , inflammatory change cardiovascular system , expect occur parathyroidectomy , evaluate assessing level inflammation biomarkers , high-sensitivity C reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) , increased level associate high cardiovascular event rate . The investigator evaluate cardiovascular system parathyroidectomy appraising level hs-CRP , measure Left Ventricular Mass Index ( LVMI ) monitoring patient ' blood pressure ( BP ) 24 hour . Primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHPT ) also associate neuromuscular abnormality . The typical symptom proximal muscle weakness muscle atrophy , especially type II fiber . Other symptom generalize fatigue , reduce well-being , hyperreflexia , abnormal gait tongue fasciculation . Although , nowadays , symptom patient present mild completely absent probably PHPT detect preclinical stage . On hand , many `` asymptomatic '' patient preoperatively , report subjective amelioration surgery , respect muscle strength function . The investigator conduct clinical examination , focus neuromuscular status , assess motor nerve conduction velocity , use electroneurography ( ENG ) muscle strength , use isokinetic dynamometer . Moreover , investigator evaluate neuromuscular junction help electrodiagnostic technique , electromyography ( EMG ) . Finally , due fact stapedius muscle small skeletal muscle human body , investigator tend measure stapedius reflex order test hypothesis association acoustic reflex improvement parathyroidectomy PHPT . 2.0 OBJECTIVES To detect compare change functional characteristic muscle , occur patient undergo surgery primary hyperparathyroidism compare patient primary hyperparathyroidism conservative treatment , patient undergo thyroid surgery healthy subject . 3.0 DESIGN AND STUDY POPULATION The study design prospective , multi-center , observational study . Any patient indication parathyroidectomy , therapeutic intervention , due primary hyperparathyroidism consider eligible . 3.1 Duration study The study conduct subject category include . It estimate take 12 month enroll patient additional 12 month obtain follow-up information 4.0 STUDY PROCEDURE 4.1 Pre-Surgery Procedures perform routine hospital examination , antibiotic prophylactic treatment , anticoagulant treatment diet accord standard management protocol record study . The following pre-surgery information record : 1 . Demographic information include : name , age , gender , ethnicity 2 . Height , weight , BMI American Society Anesthesiologists physical status classification system ( I-VI ) 3 . Behavioral history ( Smoking , alcohol drug use ) 4 . Blood Pressure Ultra Sound measurement Left Ventricular Mass Index ( LVMI ) 5 . Neurological clinical examination 6 . Hearing stapedius reflex assessment 7 . Electromyography electroneurography 8 . Muscle strength status 9 . Preoperative lab [ white blood cell ( WBC ) , hematocrit ( Ht ) , hemoglobin ( Hgb ) , serum calcium ( Ca2+ ) , free triiodothyronine ( fT3 ) , free thyroxine ( fT4 ) , thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , PTH , vitamin D ( VitD ) , creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , hs-CRP ] 10 . Diagnosis include clinical observation previous image result 11 . Pre-operative characteristic adenoma 12 . Medications 13 . Questionnaire assess subject ' physical activity 14 . Current past history surgical medical comorbidities 4.2 Intra-operative The surgeon perform preplanned operation . The following intraoperative variable record patient : 1 . Surgery date 2 . Duration surgery 3 . Operation perform 4 . Procedure related comment 5 . Intraoperative frozen section 6 . Quick intraoperative parathyroid assay ( intact PTH intra-operative value ) 4.3 Pathology data form The following pathology data record patient : 1 . Post-operative diagnosis include pathology report 2 . Weight adenoma 3 . Dimensions adenoma 4.4 Postoperative follow-up Follow-up evaluation perform hospitalization , 3rd , 6th 12th month . The following information record : 1 . Postoperative lab ( WBC , Ht , Hgb , Ca2+ , fT3 , fT4 , TSH , PTH , VitD , CPK , LDH , Hs- CRP ) 2 . Blood Pressure Ultra Sound measurement Left Ventricular Mass Index ( LVMI ) 3 . Neurological clinical examination 4 . Hearing stapedius reflex assessment 5 . Electromyography electroneurography 6 . Muscle strength status 7 . Questionnaire assess subject ' physical activity 8 . Comments 5.0 COMPLICATIONS AND ADVERSE EVENTS The investigator require notify Ethics Committee serious adverse event , accord local regulation requirement . Serious Adverse Events include : 1 . Death regardless cause 2 . Any-life-threatening event 3 . Any hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization 4 . Any event result persistent significant disability incapacity patient . 6.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The objective study detect compare change functional characteristic muscle , occur patient undergo surgery primary hyperparathyroidism compare patient , patient undergo thyroid surgery healthy subject . All subject match race , gender age . Four group form : 1 . Group A , include patient PHPT , undergo parathyroidectomy , therapeutic intervention . 2 . Group B , include patient PHPT , undergo parathyroidectomy receive conservative treatment . This group consider control group . 3 . Group C , include patient undergo thyroid surgery due nontoxic multinodular goiter solitary nontoxic thyroid adenoma . This group consider control group . 4 . Group D , include healthy subject . This group consider control group . In order efficiently evaluate contribution parathyroidectomy PHPT functional alteration occur , investigator search significant statistical difference pre- postoperative alteration muscle ' functional characteristic Group A , use repeat measure ANOVA continuous variable Cochran 's Q test categorical data . Furthermore , differences functional characteristic muscle four group explore use ANOVA continuous data Fischer 's Exact Test categorical data . Baseline characteristic summarize use appropriate descriptive statistic . Statistical significance set 0.05 . Since study pre-specified hypothesis statistical analysis exploratory interpretation result within context . 7.0 DATA MONITORING PLAN The investigator go monitor data accrual . Furthermore , investigator review progress clinical trial include safety data ensure possible conduct , record report accordance protocol , good clinical practice applicable regulatory requirement . 8.0 DATA CONFIDENTIALITY Each patient identify his/her initial unique patient identification number . Source data store source document . Only personnel responsible collect data transcribe case report form access data . Records remain site secure area . 9.0 FUNDING No additional funding execution present protocol necessary . The investigator willing execute present study without additional reimbursement . 10.0 ETHICS Prior study institution review board ( IRB ) approval obtain . Any change study protocol , informed consent form , investigator must re-approved IRB . All patient enrol study provide consent prior enter study . An informed consent form shall sign dated patient . The investigator retain form part study record . This study execute accordance Declaration Helsinki , agreement guideline conduct clinical investigation accordance principle ICH ( International Conference Harmonization ) GCP ( Good Clinical Practice ) outline E6 document . By sign present protocol , participant study commit carry accordance local legal requirement . 11.0 INFORMED CONSENT All eligible patient capacity provide inform consent . The described inclusion exclusion criterion design ensure entry appropriate population patient study approve local IRB . Screening criterion conduct coordinator . Eligible patient educate research proposal study investigator . To determine whether patient understood issue , he/she ask describe research entail whether question . All question address prior enrollment . The patient refuse participation study time . A write informed consent form generate . For patient , case report form ( CRF ) complete , provide general medical information history .</detailed_description>
