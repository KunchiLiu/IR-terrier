	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study change dynamic perfusion compute tomography image , , stereotactic body radiation therapy patient stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer spread part body . Diagnostic imaging procedure , dynamic perfusion compute tomography , measure blood flow tumor . Stereotactic body radiation therapy specialize radiation therapy send x-ray directly tumor use small dos several day may cause less damage normal tissue . Giving dynamic perfusion compute tomography image , , stereotactic body radiation therapy may help good understand radiation therapy work stop tumor growth patient non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe perfusion compute tomography ( CT ) parameter change non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) tumor prior , , 1 month , 3 month stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate tumor perfusion parameter clinical tumor response follow per standard care . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate change serum level deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) clinical response rate perfusion parameter . OUTLINE : Patients undergo dynamic perfusion compute tomography ( DPCT ) baseline , SBRT ( 2 3 fraction 3 5 fraction ) , 1 3 month post stereotactic body radiation therapy . After completion study , patient follow 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month .</detailed_description>
