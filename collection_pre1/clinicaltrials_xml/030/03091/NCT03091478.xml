	<brief_summary>This open-label phase II study pembrolizumab patient advance solid tumor leptomeningeal carcinomatosis ( LMD ) . Patients may receive number prior therapy respective solid tumor , must receive prior anti-PD-1 therapy develop progressive disease . Approximately 18 subject study receive pembrolizumab dose 200mg intravenously ( IV ) every 3 week ( Q3W ) 4 dos . In patient derive clinical benefit therapy , pembrolizumab may continue documented disease progression , unacceptable adverse event ( ) , intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment , investigator 's decision withdraw subject , subject withdrawal consent , noncompliance trial treatment procedure requirement , administrative reason .</brief_summary>

Cytologically confirm LMD radiologically detectable LMD define either/or : A measurable lesion contrastenhanced MRI either Brain Total Spine great 3mm radiate within last 3 month prior commencement study therapy . Positive CSF cytology 5 . Patients may newly diagnose receive number line prior anti cancer therapy . However , patient require receive available therapy primary disease , deem appropriate treating investigator . 6 . Non escalate steroid requirement time consent study drug initiation treatment CNS symptom . 7 . Local radiation therapy ( RT ) allow need manage symptom appropriately , long remain measurable lesion CNS . 8 . Whole brain RT may use , without predefined washout period , prior commencement study therapy lesion radiate sole measurable lesion , patient eligible base positive CSF cytology . 9 . Patients may continue therapy target agent CNS disease develop receive agent , define regimen deem safe combine anti PD 1 therapy . 10 . Be willing provide tissue archival tissue specimen select patient , available . 11 . Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale . 12 . Demonstrate adequate organ function define Table 3 , screen lab perform within 10 day treatment initiation . Table 3 . 13 . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . 14 . Female subject childbearing potential ( Section 4.8.2 ) must willing use adequate method contraception outline Section 4.8.2 Contraception , course study 120 day last dose study medication . Note : Abstinence acceptable usual lifestyle prefer contraception subject . 15 . Male subject childbearing potential ( Section 4.8.2 ) must agree use adequate method contraception outline Section 4.8.2 Contraception , start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . Note : Abstinence acceptable usual lifestyle prefer contraception subject . 1 . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week 5 half life first dose treatment , whichever short . 2 . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . 3 . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) 4 . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . 5 . Has prior anti cancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 6 . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy pre specify allow agent detailed section 4.2.6 , recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . 7 . All major surgery include prior surgery brain within 3 week commencement study therapy . 8 . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . 9 . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide use escalate steroid brain metastasis time trial consent study drug initiation , remain measurable lesion CNS , per section 4.2.6 . 10 . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( e.g . thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . 11 . Has history ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid , evidence interstitial lung disease active , noninfectious pneumonitis . 12 . Has active infection require systemic therapy . 13 . Prior disease progression antiPD1 therapy 14 .
