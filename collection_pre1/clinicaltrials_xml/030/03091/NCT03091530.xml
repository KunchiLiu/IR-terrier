	<brief_title>Glenohumeral Rotation After Throwing : RCT Comparing Sleeper Stretch 90/90 Hip Lift With Balloon Blow Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Study : The primary purpose study determine loss internal rotation follow throw session best restore soft tissue stretch sleeper stretch scapular reposition 90/90 hip lift balloon blow exercise . This study progress body research relate internal rotation deficit regard baseball thrower . The research relevant clinicians treat patient baseball player internal rotation loss . Specific Aim : To determine glenohumeral internal rotation deficit ( GIRD ) effectively restore follow throw session perform sleeper stretch ( SS ) 90/90 hip lift balloon blow exercise ( BBE ) . Hypothesis : BBE improve GIRD effectively quickly SS . This prospective randomize trial compare efficacy two exercise design improve shoulder internal rotation . Subjects meet study criterion randomly allocate group show follow CONSORT allocation diagram . Randomization perform via random number generator . Each subject participate two week-long intervention least one week separate two intervention week . During week intervention , subject baseline IR measure . He instruct perform single exercise design improve internal rotation range motion . Approximately half subject perform Sleeper Stretch first week , Balloon Blow Exercise second week . The remain group subject perform Balloon Blow Exercise first week , Sleeper Stretch second week . Both exercise instruct physical therapist commonly prescribe exercise clinical setting . A write handout detail exercise instruction , frequency , duration stretch provide subject ' reference ( submit IRB application ) . The subject perform exercise throughout week direct study personnel . Baseline measure glenohumeral internal rotation ( IR ) shoulder position 90 degree abduction scapular plane obtain use goniometer , describe Manske . These measurement repeat initiation intervention exercise follow interval : 2 hour , 1 day , 2 day , 3 day 4 day . All measure IR take 3 time average three measure use data analysis . The investigator perform measure blind participant group assignment . When subject complete intervention week , ask personal preference either exercise .</detailed_description>
