	<detailed_description>IBD Pregnancy : Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) chronic inflammatory disorder gastrointestinal tract comprise two subtypes , Crohn 's disease ( CD ) Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) , Canada among high report incidence CD UC world , high 20.2 19.5 per 100,000 , respectively . Because risk IBD great third decade life , great impact woman reproductive year . In comparison general population , woman IBD significantly high risk pregnancy related complication . IBD Disease Activity Outcomes : Active IBD symptom pregnancy significantly increase risk preterm birth . Furthermore , woman IBD suffer relapse pregnancy , require hospitalization , likely asymptomatic counterpart delivery preterm birth low birth weight newborn . More two-thirds woman active disease time conception continue worsened symptom pregnancy . In contrast , woman asymptomatic conception half likely active disease pregnancy . This data underscore importance achieve disease remission prior conception aggressively treat relapse pregnancy . Medication Adherence During Pregnancy : Despite safety IBD medication , pregnant woman IBD exhibit low medication adherence rate . Medication non-compliance often link concern IBD medication may confer unnecessary harm fetus . Most woman report would rather endure symptom IBD rather confer risk fetus , without realize active IBD strongly associate adverse pregnancy outcome . Consequently , woman decrease dosage stop medication without inform treat physician , thus comprise treatment . Motivational Interviewing Adherence : Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) refer patient-centered process health care provider employ specific communication skill strategy facilitate patient confidence decision making , emphasise respect autonomy . A key feature MI counsel process induces behavioural change trigger channel patient 's internal motivation change . Previous clinical trial demonstrate effectiveness MI improve medication adherence various chronic condition , include diabetes , hypertension , obesity HIV . In small study IBD subject , MI associate positive patient perception physician-patient relationship . In another pilot study , nurse-administered MI UC patient associated medication adherence high 90 % . Rationale : Pregnancy especially vulnerable time woman IBD . During critical window time , even brief lapse medication adherence lead sub optimal control IBD disease activity lead life-threatening complication mother fetus . Adverse outcome preterm delivery long-term implication child mother IBD . Out misguide concern fetus , many woman may stop lifesaving medication . Educating pregnant woman IBD important step improve adherence rate , tool motivational interview proven much powerful . As primary objective study ass , multi-center clinical trial , whether patient-centered counsel incorporate motivational interview telemedicine-based follow-up IBD nurse lead improved medication adherence pregnancy improve pregnancy outcome . The investigator hypothesize patient-centered counselling result high medication adherence rate improved pregnancy outcome . Design : The investigator conduct multi-center randomize controlled clinical trial include 3 University Toronto affiliate hospital ( Mount Sinai Hospital , University Health Network , Women 's College Hospital ) University Calgary . Study Population : The investigator enroll 150 pregnant woman see : obstetrician maternal fetal specialist Mount Sinai Hospital University Calgary ; gastroenterologist Mount Sinai Hospital , University Health Network , Women 's College , University Calgary meet inclusion criterion . Significance : This clinical intervention potential directly impact inflammatory bowel disease patient reduce complication disease pregnancy . Motivational interview potentially improve adherence optimize impact IBD medical therapy . Most tertiary center already clinical IBD nurse . The structured training IBD nurse counsel pregnant woman motivational interview reproducible intervention use tertiary center throughout country . Because poor disease control lead preterm delivery , associate lifelong chronic illness , patient-centered counselling would ameliorate IBD health mother , also improve life child . Improved pregnancy outcome would also lead decrease health care utilization associate health care . Findings study would also allow physician lobby provincial health ministry request fund IBD nurse counsellor .</detailed_description>
