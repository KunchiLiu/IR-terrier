	<brief_summary>Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) improve health 18 million people infected HIV control viral replication , AIDS non-AIDS event , reduce risk transmission . However , existence latent viral reservoir long-lived memory CD4 T cell remain hurdle cure HIV infection ; consequently patient must remain ART rest life . Recently , realistic approach limelight identify strategy lead functional cure , define natural control viral reservoir host . Use recombinant human growth hormone show improve immune function several mechanism . This study hypothesize treatment recombinant human growth hormone decrease size replication competent HIV reservoir HIV-infected immune-reconstituted individual . The specific study objective include : - To evaluate effect recombinant human growth hormone administration 48 week size replication competent HIV reservoir - To evaluate safety tolerability recombinant human growth hormone administration 48 week HIV-infected individual suppressive ART . For purpose , investigator add recombinant human growth hormone treatment patient receive stable ART . Approximately 22 participant enrol study Chronic Viral Illness Service McGill University Health Centre ( Montreal , Canada ) , last 52 week . Participants treat recombinant human growth hormone total 48 week . The initial recombinant human growth hormone dose 3 mg/day ( 30-40 µg/kg/d ) 24 week administer subcutaneous injection outpatient basis , follow dose reduction 1.5 mg/day final 24 week treatment period , also conduct outpatient basis . The study inclusion criterion include male female participant , ≥18 &lt; 40 year age , undetectable viral load ( quantity HIV virus blood must less 50 copies/ml ) last 24 month CD4 T-cell count ≥350 cells/mm3 obtain within 30 day prior study entry . The finding study contribute development novel strategy eradicate HIV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) dramatically reduce death rate AIDS improve quality life many HIV-infected individual . However , ART eradicate HIV demonstrate rapid return viremia whenever treatment interrupt . The possible long-term toxicity associate ART , viral resistance , stigma cost contribute necessity find cure . A sterilizing cure , virus completely eradicate , would require elimination replication-competent virus throughout body . An alternative approach , probably realistic , would aim kind `` cancer model '' cure , individual would enjoy long-term health absence ART , disease `` remission '' , might achieve reduce amount residual HIV ART ( `` reservoir '' ) level immune system effectively control . This commonly referred functional cure viral reservoir naturally control host . Both form cure ( sterilize functional ) would require eliminating , least reducing , reservoirs HIV infection . Different type cell carry persistent HIV virally suppress individual . Although myeloid cell may also contribute HIV persistence , well establish majority replication competent viral genome persist memory CD4 T cell ART . In contrast , naïve CD4 T cell rarely infect virally suppressed individual . As result low infection rate , frequency naïve cell negatively correlate size viral reservoir . Therefore , increase frequency naïve cell may actively reduce size latent HIV reservoir . The thymic activity gradually decrease age . The production recent thymic emigrant ( RTEs ) drastically reduce elderly , result decrease proportion new naïve cell CD4 compartment , compensate proliferation naïve cell periphery . Thus , stability naïve cell pool ensure different mechanism young elderly , major contribution thymus young people . The study investigator preliminary data indicate size reservoir measure integrated DNA strongly correlate age virally suppressed individual , young individual display small reservoir ) . Although mechanism underlie remarkable association unknown likely multi-factorial , continued generation naïve CD4 T cell ART could lead time replenishment infected memory cell new uninfected memory cell . Recombinant human growth hormone ( rhGH ) administer ART-treated HIV infected individual find reverse thymic involution , increase total naïve CD4 T cell count reduce expression activation apoptosis marker . Reconstitution thymus immunosuppressed adult rhGH hormone treatment restore HIV-specific cellular antibody response . Altogether , observation suggest administration rhGH may reduce size latent HIV reservoir 1 ) increase frequency naïve cell 2 ) reducing level immune activation 3 ) restore HIV specific immune response , three parameter associate size latent HIV reservoir . In clinical trial conduct date use pharmacologic dos GH , common adverse effect arthralgia edema , occur approximately 35 % patient ; myalgia , observe 30 % patient GH . Other less common effect believe related GH treatment include increase blood pressure , headache , hyperglycemia diabetes , enlargement male breast tissue , carpal tunnel syndrome , pancreatitis . Other , extremely rare , potential side effect may relate GH allergic reaction GH , idiopathic intracranial hypertension , hypothyroidism , leukemia . There conflict evidence whether GH increase occurrence lymphoma cancer patient infected HIV . While participant enrol trial might benefit directly strategy , expect trial provide useful information relate directly status study participant ( HIV infection HIV reservoir , immunotherapeutic approach etc. ) . In addition , study participant enrol trial receive compensation , clinical monitoring , laboratory monitoring continue adherence counseling . The investigator ' primary hypothesis treatment recombinant human growth hormone result decrease size replication competent HIV reservoir HIV-infected immune-reconstituted individual . A reduction size HIV reservoir unlikely direct clinical benefit participant . However , may contribute , association therapy , development novel strategy eradicate HIV future .</detailed_description>
