	<brief_summary>This non-randomized , single-blind post market clinical follow-up study 50 patient imaged Judy Dan Research Treatment Centre present chronic receive standard wound care treatment . The : X image device visualizes fluoresce bacteria real-time . The device use adjunctive tool assessment wound use guide targeted sample wound ( curettage scrap ) . The overall objective work evaluate positive predictive value ( PPV ) MolecuLight : X Imaging Device predict presence bacteria chronic wound . The presence bacteria determine micro-biologically semi-quantitative culture analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post Market Clinical Followup MolecuLight : X 's PPV Predict Presence Bacteria Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MolecuLight Inc. ( Toronto , Canada ) recently introduce Canadian market innovative imaging device , MolecuLight : Xâ„¢ Imaging Device , offer real-time detection important biological molecular information chronic wound , could significant impact improve conventional wound care management . The MolecuLight : X Imaging Device intend assist clinician care management patient chronic wound screen presence potentially harmful bacteria level . The device capture document either image video chronic wound presence fluorescent bacteria appear violet light illumination . This information use guide clinician inspect , sample , debride evaluate area within around wound fluorescent bacteria present . Though MolecuLight : X Imaging Device show effective control setting , study deploy device large population evaluate ability MolecuLight : X device positively predict presence bacteria chronic wound . The overall objective work evaluate MolecuLight : X Imaging Device screen chronic wound presence bacteria . The device intend guide clinician inspect , sample , debride evaluate area within around wound fluorescent bacteria present . All image perform MolecuLight : X Imaging Device appropriate distance wound interest ( 8 - 12 cm ) , indicate range finder LED . Illumination provide two violet ( 405 nm ) LEDs produce bright , clinically safe , uniform illumination . Fluorescence image perform camera real-time device fluorescence mode room light turn . If room ambient light eliminate acceptable level ( indicated ambient light sensor ) , MolecuLight drape must use achieve dark environment . A standard measurement sticker place adjacent wound within field view act reference size . All microbiological analysis perform per clinic standard practice . Tissue sample analyzed culture sensitivity , yield specie bacteria present sample ( ) , susceptibility various antibiotic measure bacterial load .</detailed_description>
