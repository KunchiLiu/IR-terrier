	<detailed_description>Intubation ventilation lifesaving intervention neonatal intensive care unit ( ICU ) , especially among preterm , low birth weight baby . However , timely extubation also necessary , order prevent adverse effect prolong intubation , iatrogenic pneumothorax , superadded bacterial infection colonization , subglottic injury bronchopulmonary dysplasia1,2 . For extubation successful , baby maintain hemodynamic stability O2 saturation least 48 hour post-extubation . So far standard guideline , especially low resource country , predict successful extubation . The decision extubate usually depend clinical judgement , appropriate blood gas prior extubation low ventilator parameters3 . Intensivists may vary experience training , result large variation time outcome extubation . Research high income setting indicate approximately 40 % baby extubated criterion require re-intubation , suggest current method predict extubation failure insufficient.3 Readiness extubation objectively measure observe pulmonary function , respiratory muscle strength , respiratory drive , ventilator flow volume gas exchange.5,6 Re-intubation cause prolong hospital stay , adversely effect family , result undesirable effect neonate4 . Therefore accurate prediction extubation failure neonates high priority . Spontaneous breathe trial ( SBT ) predominantly use infant child access readiness extubation . Few study premature neonate also show good sensitivity specificity predict extubation sucess7.However significance population yet determine . We aim use preterm term baby result significant plan include routine pre extubation criterion . Primary Objective : To evaluate usefulness SBT , predict extubation failure among neonate admit NICU tertiary care hospital Karachi , Pakistan . Secondary Objective : 1 . To evaluate usefulness ratio spontaneous expire minute ventilation ( VE ) ET CPAP VE mechanical ventilation ( V˙E ratio , ) predict extubation failure among neonate admit NICU tertiary care hospital Karachi , Pakistan . 2 . To evaluate usefulness VE ETCPAP , predict extubation failure among neonate admit NICU tertiary care hospital Karachi , Pakistan . Study Design : Prospective validation study Study Setting : NICU , AKU Duration study : 12 month Study Population : Neonates admit tertiary care NICU low resource set Operational definition : 1 . Expired Tidal volume ( Vte ) : volume gas ( ml ) move lung breath . 2 . Spontaneous Expired Minute ventilation ( VE ) : amount gas spontaneously exhale lung one minute . This product Vte respiratory rate . It display real time SLE 5000 ventilator . Normal value full term baby 200-400 ml/kg/min whereas 200-300 ml /kg/min preterm baby . 3 . VE Ratio : Et cpapVE/Vent VE Sampling technique : Consecutive sample Sample size : Assuming SBT 95 % sensitivity 73 % specificity predict extubation sucess7 , presume 30 % neonate fail extubation , require 45 neonate group obtain 95 % CIs ±3 % . The sample size inflate 20 % accommodate difference re-intubation practice . Therefore 55 neonate group enrol study . This sample size sufficient also detect difference 1 SD mean VE group fail extubation , assume overall mean VE 300ml/kg/min ( power 80 % twotail αof 0.05 ) . Study Methods : Identification recruitment neonate : An NICU fellow involve clinical management baby maintain log neonate plan extubated . Eligibility assessment do fellow approach neonate 's family consent . Care take ensure consent voluntary . Refusal consent lead change management . A baseline questionnaire fill , include demographic information post -natal age , gender , gestational age , current weight etc . Information related clinical indication extubation , medication give record . Eligible candidate divide two group &lt; 1.5kg weight &gt; 1.5kg weight . Separate log maintain group . Total 55 enrolment make group . Data collection : Will accord SOP . Questionnaires attach . Index Maneuver : After enrolment , Nicu SBT study fellow observe record clinical data patient demographic predefined proforma . Vitals , include heart rate , respiratory rate , ventilator parameter respiratory volume record observer 3 minute 30 second interval . After 3 minute baby shift ET CPAP mode ventilator parameter rerecorded 30 sec interval 3 minute do previously . A regularly service authorized stop watch use monitor time parameter record Mindray ( IPM12 ) monitor SLE 5000 ventilator . The clinical team care patient present maneuver baby extubated per primary team plan . Criteria stop index maneuver : Bradycardia ( Heart rate &lt; 100bpm ) &gt; 15 second and/or oxygen Saturation &lt; 85 % even 15 % increase Fi02 baseline . Follow-up outcome : Outcomes extubation record separately 48 hour . The reason re-intubation also record . Blinding : SBT maneuver perform fellow involved clinical team . The clinical team blind result SBT . The success failure SBT determine principal investigator , blind outcome extubation , completion study SBT Results : SBT label fail criterion stop index maneuver apply . Analysis plan : Descriptive analysis group perform continuous variable like age , weight , gestational age , chronological age use mean SD median interquartile range appropriate . For categorical variable e.g . gender , frequency proportion report . Multiple logistic regression do identify factor predict SBT failure group . P value &lt; 0.05 take significant.. Sensitivity , specificity , PPV , NPV , LR calculate use area curve ( AUC ) . Subgroup analysis secondary outcome perform different gestational age weight category . Continuous outcome compare use student 's test normally distribute Mann-whitney U test skew . Categorical data assess use chi square test fisher two tail exact test indicate . The ability outcome ( SBT , VE , VE ratio ) variables accurately discriminate successful fail extubation assess use receiver operate curve ( ROC ) . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Informed Consent The informed consent confirm signature thumbprint parent authorize guardian child . In absence signature , witness ( member research team obtain consent ) ask sign . Finally , member research team obtain consent sign form . Safety Risks There potential risk transient hemodynamic instability perform SBT . That , safety net place record heart rate O2 saturation every 30 second . A trained nurse neonatal fellow train NRP available bedside procedure . The fellow performing procedure year two NRP certification . He train immediately revert ventilation mode HR &lt; 100 beat per minute &gt; 15 second increase Oxygen requirement O2 . This practice another study NICU PG Davis et al 2006 show adverse effects7 . Vulnerable Populations Study population neonate study involve optimize NICU care neonate . Consent take Urdu ensure potential participant understand research . Extra protection place ensure voluntary participation . It explain participation voluntary terminate participant time without reason without penalty . If potential participant question , answer native language ensure understand research potential role . The study personnel influence clinical team 's decision care neonate . Confidentiality To ensure privacy , interview take place separate room . Hard copy study-related form store locked cabinet storage room supervision principal investigator . Only approve study personnel access information . After completion study , identifier information strip study IDs use analysis . All identifier information delinked identifier information store lock key .</detailed_description>
