	<brief_title>Long-term Consequences Necrotizing Enterocolitis Newborn Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Knowledge long-term complication relate necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) neonatal period essential , clinician counsel parent risk complication follow NEC . When decide upon follow-up strategy infant discharge , knowledge also crucial . If infant increase risk complication later life , close follow important assure proper handle complication . So far , definite conclusion regard long-term complication NEC make . A systematic review include ten study , show significantly increase risk neurodevelopmental impairment NEC child . However , median follow-up time exceed two year may reflect true long-term complication . The ORACLE Children Study investigate neurodevelopmental impairment child history NEC 7,5 year follow-up find increase risk . No review publish regard growth impairment far , available study less three year follow-up period report conflict result . Gastrointestinal morbidity even less investigated report association NEC within three year follow-up . However , ORACLE Children Study find increase risk bowel problem 7,5 year follow-up child history NEC . The Oracle Children Study Roze et al report behavioural problem 30 % child history NEC school age , statistic significance find compare control-group . Further study investigate outcome NEC-children school age need . Objectives The investigator plan conduct retrospective parental-questionnare study , determine long-term complication related diagnosis NEC school age ( 5-15 year age ) . Methods This case-control study . Case-group include survive child bear Denmark 1st January 2002 31st December 2011 international classification disease ( ICD-10 ) diagnosis NEC discharge . Matching child history NEC two child history NEC gestational age , year birth birthweight form control group . Matching criterion 's choose balance prematurity age follow-up case control-group . Parental follow-up questionnaire regard complication send parent case control . Clinical data child , regard birth neonatal history , obtain use mixed regression model adjust possible confounders . Primary outcome Abnormal borderline 'total difficulty score ' strenghts-and-difficulties-questionnaire assess parent . Secondary outcomes 1 . Severe cerebral palsy ( GMFCS III-IV ) 2 . Head circumference measure parent 3 . Height measure parent 4 . Abdominal symptom result significant absence school report parent 5 . Diarrhoea within last six month 6 . Constipation within last six month Power calculation The sample size case group estimate include 200 child NEC ( no-response drop 20 % ) control group 300 child without NEC , 1:2 match ratio assumption response rate lower control group. , i.e . 250 parent child NEC 500 parent control child contact . SDQ total score Assuming 30 % prevalence abnormal borderline score 'total difficulty ' strength-and-difficulties-questionnaire NEC-survivors , compare assume 20 % control ( 19 ) , study detect difference power 72 % 5 % significance level . Severe cerebral palsy ( GMFCS score III-V ) Assuming 20 % prevalence ( 9 ) severe cerebral palsy NEC-survivors compare assume 10 % control ( 22 ) study detect difference power 87 % 5 % significance level . Head circumference The power calculation cohort show , 5 % significance level , detect difference mean head circumference 0.3 standard-deviations , power 90 % . Analysis plan Primary outcome : p-value &lt; 0.05 consider significant . To determine difference SDQ-scores case- control group , Chi-squared test Fischer 's Exact test use appropriate . Secondary outcome : p-value &lt; 0.01 consider significant . Differences 'height ' , 'head circumference ' 'absence school due abdominal symptom ' investigate t-test Mann-Whitney 's test appropriate . 'Severe cerebral palsy ' , 'diarrhoea ' 'constipation ' analyze Chi-squared test FischerÂ´s Exact test appropriate . At first , unadjusted analysis perform investigate difference primary secondary outcome . Secondly , mixed regression model use adjust possible confounders</detailed_description>
