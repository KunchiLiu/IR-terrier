	<brief_title>Music-listening During Deep Brain Stimulation Relieve Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While conscious neurosurgical intervention generally well-tolerated , often cause measure pain anxiety . Patients report suffer recur distress recollection , dream , surgery post-operative , Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder-like sequela . High anxiety surgery correlate post-operative psychological disturbance . Notably , listen music reduces anxiety patient undergo awake surgical procedure . Nonetheless , DBS typically perform without music ambient noise typically interfere interpretation neuronal recording . Recording objective subjective measure stress DBS provide unique opportunity determine effect music intra-operative patient anxiety level patient listen music compare non-music listen control patient . We hypothesize play music improve intra-operative anxiety measure objective subjective measure stress , include blood pressure , heart rate , cortisol level anxiety questionnaire . Additionally , previous data lab demonstrate subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) respond melodic music decrease average frequency neuronal firing . Our pilot study also suggest STN thalamic neuron respond differently melodic music ; neuron STN increase synchrony firing , neuron thalamus decrease synchrony fire course music clip . We , therefore , aim characterize neuronal firing pattern change patient undergo awake DBS procedure great detail , draw large sample size .</detailed_description>
