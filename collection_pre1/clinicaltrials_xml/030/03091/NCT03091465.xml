	<brief_summary>This nation-wide retrospective observational study perform 50 centre Spain , geographically representative region , least 5 patient treat first-line pazopanib mRCC daily clinical practice since April 2011 ( date approval pazopanib Spain ) , January 2016 . Pazopanib one standard tyrosine-kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) first-line treatment metastatic renal cell carcinoma . In previous SPAZO study , Spanish Oncologic Genitourinary Group ( SOGUG ) validate IMDC prognostic classification patient receive first-line pazopanib , demonstrate effectiveness drug routine clinical practice . However , series 278 patient , could obtain enough information effectiveness pazopanib special subpopulation non-clear cell histology , others subgroup , due small simple size subpopulation . On hand , result RECORD-1 AXIS trial , switch everolimus axitinib current approach patient progress first-line TKI . However , pivotal study include patient treat first-line pazopanib study drug available time . The result SPAZO study also suggest effectiveness second-line target therapy ( TT ) pazopanib routine clinical practice similar observe clinical trial sunitinib , sorafenib bevacizumab . In addition , preliminary result indicate meaningful difference effectiveness TKI mTOR inhibitor pazopanib , result adjust IMDC prognostic classification . However , IMDC prognostic classification second-line TT yet validate patient receive pazopanib first-line . In addition sample size large enough make comparison effectiveness mTOR inhibitor antiVEGF prognostic subgroup IMDC . Based , Spanish Oncologic Genitourinary Group decide launch SPAZO-2 study , intend prolong follow patient include SPAZO , increase sample size new patient new centre , order obtain large sample subpopulation interest , objective obtain information question .</brief_summary>
