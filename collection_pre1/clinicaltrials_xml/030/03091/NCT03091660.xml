	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study Tokyo-172 strain bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) solution without vaccination use Tokyo-172 strain BCG see well work compare TICE BCG solution treat patient bladder cancer spread muscle . BCG non-infectious bacteria instill bladder may stimulate immune system fight bladder cancer . Giving different version BCG vaccine therapy may prevent bladder cancer returning .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Different Strains BCG With Without Vaccine High Grade Non- Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare whether time high grade recurrence ( TTHGR ) patient BCG-naïve , non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) receive Tokyo-172 BCG strain ( Arm II ) non-inferior patient receive TICE BCG strain ( Arm I ) . II . To test whether TTHGR patient BCG-naïve , NMIBC receive intradermal Tokyo-172 BCG vaccination follow intravesical Tokyo-172 BCG instillation ( Arm III ) superior patient receive intravesical Tokyo-172BCG instillation without prior intradermal BCG vaccination ( Arm II ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare time recurrence ( TTR ) any-grade ( AG ) bladder cancer patient receive Tokyo-172 versus TICE BCG strain . II . To compare TTR AG bladder cancer patient receive intradermal + intravesical versus intravesical Tokyo-172 BCG . III . To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient receive Tokyo-172 versus TICE BCG strain . IV . To compare PFS patient receive intradermal + intravesical versus intravesical Tokyo-172 BCG . V. To compare 6-month complete response patient carcinoma situ ( CIS ) without Ta T1 cancer present baseline receive Tokyo-172 versus TICE BCG strain . VI . To compare 6-month complete response patient CIS without Ta T1 cancer present baseline receive intradermal + intravesical versus intravesical Tokyo-172 BCG . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test hypothesis purify protein derivative ( PPD ) test conversion ( positive PPD 3 6 month ) follow BCG immunotherapy predict time high grade recurrence ( TTHGR ) . II . To test hypothesis urinary cytokine level follow BCG immunotherapy predict time high grade recurrence ( TTHGR ) . III . To test hypothesis tumor neoantigen burden T lymphocyte infiltration associate BCG response . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : INDUCTION : Patients receive TICE BCG solution intravesically week 6 week . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive TICE BCG solution week 3 consecutive week month 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 7 dos . ARM II : INDUCTION : Patients receive Tokyo-172 strain BCG solution intravesically week 6 week . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive Tokyo-172 strain BCG solution week 3 consecutive week month 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 7 dos . ARM III : PRIME : Patients receive Tokyo-172 strain BCG vaccine intradermally ( ID ) . INDUCTION : Within 21 day , patient receive Tokyo-172 strain BCG solution Arm II . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive Tokyo-172 strain BCG solution Arm II . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
