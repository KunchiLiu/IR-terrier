	<brief_summary>The primary objective study match sensitivity , specificity , negative predicate value positive predictive value Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound ( CEUS ) , Shear Wave Elastography ( SWE ) combination detect clinically significant prostate carcinoma foki . Conventional ultrasound insufficient safely display prostate carcinoma . Therefore , image agent recently add improve detection tumor focus . These include innovative image ultrasound method multiparametric MRI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiparametric Ultrasound-Study Detection Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient schedule radical prostatectomy Martini-Klinik admit day prior surgery . In case patient give informed consent mpUS ( multiparametric Ultrasound ) scan perform day prior surgery , day admittance . The patient prepare intravenous access administer contrast agent . Ultrasound Scanning perform left-lateral decubitus position start regular B-mode scanning volumetry . A base apex sweep leave right sweep acquire allow building 3D reconstruction prostate . The image protocol start SWE . Stiffness tissue measure Shear modulus ( kPa ) visualize color scale . SWE result record late interpretation analysis . Then 2 minute recording CEUS image make follow administration 2.4ml bolus contrast agent SonoVue® ( Bracco , Geneva ) intravenous canula . A maximum four recording make . For every record new bolus contrast agent administer . In way , plane contrast inflow record . Data store transported image processing system dispersion analysis . On system dispersion ( CUDI ) parametric map construct acquire CEUS record . At time interpretation image result score separately standard prostate sextant , base leave , base right , mid leave , mid right , apex leave apex right . The radical prostatectomy perform accordance institution standard . This procedure alter trial . In many case mean frozen section take intraoperatively lateral side prostate . These frozen section process separately resection specimen pathology lab . Following radical prostatectomy resection specimen fixate accord institution standard . This mean specimen photograph location orientation coupe record . This enable allocate pathology finding standard prostate sextant describe earlier .</detailed_description>
