	<detailed_description>The burden smoking tobacco Canadian public well-documented . Typically , two third Canadian smoker consider quit attempt next six month . When individual addict nicotine stop administer psycho-stimulate cognitive deficit tobacco craving arise forefront unsuccessful quit attempt . Studies show smoke nicotine administration enhances alert orient attention , short-term episodic memory , work memory smoker deprive minimally deprive nicotine . Moderate intensity exercise show increase many cognitive function brain non-smokers . Moderate intensity exercise also show increase cognition nicotine non-smoking population . Research regard effect moderate exercise cognition non- deprive , well nicotine- deprive smoker unknown . The study begin April 2017 . The main purpose project examine exercise could pragmatic alternative smoking cognitive deficit arise quit attempt . Thirsty four adult smoker follow protocol list : Stage I utilize within subject counter-balanced design . Previous arrival phase I participants asked keep consumption coffee half cup day test , abstain alcohol drug least 18 hour prior test , smoke cigarette choice 30 minute prior arrival ( standardization ) . Participants urge arrive time visit . Upon arrival Exercise Health Psychology lab ( locate room 408 Arthur Sonia Labatt Health Science Building Western University ) participant verified smoker ( base reading piCO+ Smokerlyzer great 10 P.P.M . ) , give letter information sign inform consent form . Participants also ask complete demographic survey , smoke history questionnaire , PAR-Q readiness exercise , Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire , Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence , pre nicotine pre exercise questionnaire . Vitals ( heart rate blood pressure ) assess follow completion questionnaire well post intervention seat position . Prior evaluation N-back task ( cognitive memory task describe ) practice stage conduct participant consistently score 75 % high three consecutive trial eliminate learn effect . After establish familiarity baseline cognition score conduct . The subject give 5 minute break ( i.e. , use lavatory ) . Following break participant randomize either exercise nicotine inhalation group . The intervention follow ; Moderate Intensity Exercise persist 20-minute bout moderate intensity aerobic exercise . Exercise consist 2-minute warm-up , follow 15 min walk rate , allow reach 2/3 max heart rate , 3-minute cool treadmill equal 20 minute . The Nicotine inhalation group smoke cigarette completion choice , 20 minute time period allocate . During time participant refrain conversation . The post intervention assessment begin within two minute completion either intervention . The second visit phase I take place follow day time ( possible ) . During second visit participant 's complete pre nicotine pre exercise questionnaire vitals monitor pre post intervention . The participant participate intervention receive first visit ( example , participant receive nicotine inhalation first visit participant receive moderate intensity aerobic exercise second visit ) . Within two minute completion post treatment N-back task assessment begin . Previous arrival stage II participant ask keep consumption coffee half cup day test , abstain alcohol drug least 18 hour prior test , abstain smoke least 12 hour ( overnight abstinence ) . Stage II utilize participant phase I examine nicotine-deprived state ( 12 hour ) baseline N-back score randomize nicotine inhalation group exercise treatment group post intervention N-back score obtain . Pre nicotine pre exercise questionnaire complete vitals ( heart rate blood pressure ) assess pre post intervention . Smoking abstinence validate piCO+ Smokerlyzer reading le 10 P.P.M . This study ( ) provide information cognition non-deprived smoker nicotine deprive smoker ( b ) demonstrate moderate intensity exercise would pragmatic alternative nicotine replenish work memory deficit population ( c ) add literature moderate intensity exercise valid aid smoker attempt real quit attempt ( ) assist development new cessation program involve exercise .</detailed_description>
