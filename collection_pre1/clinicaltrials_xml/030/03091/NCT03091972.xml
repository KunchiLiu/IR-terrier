	<brief_title>Liner Ablation Using Contact-force Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter ablation currently accept treatment option symptomatic atrial fibrillation . Linear ablation frequently use procedure persistent atrial fibrillation . Multiple study show benefit linear ablation . However , limitation technical difficulty . Incomplete block common important cause atrial tachycardia . Contact-force ( CF ) monitoring procedure recently available . This technology appear significantly decrease procedure time short term reconnection incidence pulmonary vein ( PV ) isolation . It also help resolve cause PV reconnection . Some report demonstrate association reconnection lower CF value . Linear ablation variation interrupt block reconnection often PV isolation . The association CF value successful linear block reveal yet . In addition , investigator aim effectiveness safety linear ablation use CF sense catheter .</detailed_description>
