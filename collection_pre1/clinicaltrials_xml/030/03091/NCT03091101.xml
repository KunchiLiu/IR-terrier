	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate change corneal innervation scleral contact lens wear keratoconic population . Specifically , change corneal sensitivity nerve fiber density baseline central mid-peripheral corneal location measure 6-month lens wear period . An additional aim study investigate impact scleral lens wear corneal inflammation within study group . This achieve compare dendritic cell density change baseline study period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Scleral Contact Lens Wear Corneal Nerves Keratoconus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The human cornea densely innervated tissue provide high level sensitivity foreign object noxious substance . The innervation cornea also play important role tropic maintenance repair corneal surface . Any alteration normal innervation cornea lessen ability detect foreign object could damage ocular surface , also reduce wound heal ability . Previous study show rigid contact lens wear reduces corneal sensitivity nerve fiber density keratoconic subject . Scleral contact lenses large diameter rigid gas permeable lens rest sclera vault cornea fluid reservoir . The use scleral contact lenses become one current standard nonsurgical management corneal dystrophy keratoconus , mainly due improve comfort vision quality compare conventional rigid lens . Despite patient benefit , little known impact scleral contact lens wear corneal sensitivity nerve morphology keratoconus . The purpose study investigate change corneal innervation scleral contact lens wear keratoconic population . Specifically , change corneal sensitivity nerve fiber density baseline central mid-peripheral corneal location measure 6-month lens wear period . An additional aim study investigate impact scleral lens wear corneal inflammation within study group . This achieve compare dendritic cell density change baseline study period . The investigator propose take sample keratoconic participant fit scleral lens : 1 . Measure corneal sensitivity two corneal location 1-month , 3-months 6-months scleral lens wear . 2 . Capture image sub-basal nerve plexus vivo use laser-scanning confocal microscopy similar corneal location study visit . 3 . Calculate nerve morphology parameter dendritic cell density capture image . Up 15 participant enrol .</detailed_description>
