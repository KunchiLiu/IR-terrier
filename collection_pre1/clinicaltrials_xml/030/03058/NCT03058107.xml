	<brief_summary>Cancer worldwide spread disease high prevalence incidence , often poor prognosis typically diagnose advanced stage . Another reason prognosis presence malnutrition , one hand diminish intake ( due anorexia ) , hand tumor-induced hypercatabolism . The result pathological state body call `` cachexia '' , generally define weight loss &gt; 5 % last 6 month diagnosis . It already demonstrate correct nutrition patient limit morbidity , promote progression-free survival well well-being . The pilot study , previously perform investigator , first suggest Nutrition Therapy , base ESPEN guideline rest energy expenditure measure indirect calorimetry , promote overall survival . The aim project validate preliminary result large RCT ( randomize control double-blind trial ) , promote Nutrition Therapy novel modality right treatment cancer , rather merely supportive .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tight Caloric Control Cachectic Oncologic Patient ( TiCaCONCO CaCoS CoCoN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In investigator ' pilot trial , 20 patient randomize , 10 receive regular counseling regular oncodietitians , 10 others receive nutrition therapy . In latter group , assessment biophysical parameter make ( include Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis BIA body composition ) , patient ' Energy Expenditure assess use indirect calorimetry . Afterwards , patient receive nutrition therapy accord ESPEN ( European Society Parenteral Enteral Nutrition ) guideline . Supplementary intervention make match caloric intake energy expenditure ( 'Tight Caloric ' approach ) , use enteral parenteral nutrition indicate , intensive coach follow-up continue nutrition strategy ( dietician even `` call '' hour ) . While study follow-up last 2 year , nutrition therapy perform first 3 month . The result striking : apart keep body weight balance , patient nutrition therapy group count much less unexpected hospitalisation day clearly live much longer . This project target validation result large scale . For study , patient either colorectal adenocarcinoma non-small cell lung carcinoma , due high incidence well high prevalence cachexia patient include . Patients randomize , study intend double-blinded , although difficult maintain practice due nature treatment . The recruitment phase last 2 year , keep refusal dropout mind . Follow-up last 1 year inclusion , although actual nutrition therapy last 3 month : period active oncological treatment . An intermediate analysis already make 6 month follow-up . In case survival already statistically significant , trial stop ethical reason . In case positive result , investigator want implement nutrition therapy standard treatment cachectic cancer patient Belgium . In case positive outcome ( i.e . mere confirmation publish result ) , major advantage nutrition therapy relatively low cost still affect morbidity mortality significantly . This practically achieve redefine dietician 's task . The patient 's active participation decision make process important surplus well-being overall treatment . In combination decrease morbidity mortality benefit patient find every level .</detailed_description>
