	<brief_summary>To ascertain whether home-based nocturnal TLA usage 12 month period reduce exacerbation improve asthma control quality life compare placebo , whilst cost-effective acceptable adult poorly-controlled , severe allergic asthma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laminar Airflow Severe Asthma Exacerbation Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We include 222 adult , half give TLA device work , half give device inactivate ( filter process switch , although participant able tell occur ) . Which participant receive work deactivate device decide random process unknown researcher participant . An engineering team manufacturer install device participant ' home beginning study available throughout study period deal query . All participant continue receive usual treatment . Participants study 12 month , report asthma attack trial team whenever occur period . In addition , visit trial team 4 time ( 3 , 6 , 9 12 month ) assess asthma control quality life . At end trial , invite participant site join group discussion researcher explore participant 's thought TLA device . At end participation trial , participant use device 6 month , regardless initial study group , offer opportunity keep active device home free charge four year .</detailed_description>
