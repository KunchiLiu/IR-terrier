	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Bioavailability Study Arbaclofen Placarbil Modified Release Formulations Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For Parts 1 , 2 3 , participant attend clinical unit screen visit 28 day dose . For treatment period , eligible subject admit clinical unit even dosing ( Day -1 ) . Participants receive regimen morning Day 1 remain site 48 h post-dose . There minimum washout period 7 day administration regimen . Where interim decision occur , interval period sufficient permit decision process . Arbaclofen Placarbil MR Prototype Tablets administer Part 1 one prototype select development Part 2 release rate modify release ( MR ) prototype formulation optimise use design space concept ( fix low dose ) . A select MR prototype formulation Part 2 may administer Part 3 4 different dose level ( low , mid-low , mid-high , high ) . The suggested dos Part 3 may modify base emerge safety PK data Part 2 study . In Parts 2 3 , option dose select Arbaclofen Placarbil MR Prototype Tablets feed state .</detailed_description>
