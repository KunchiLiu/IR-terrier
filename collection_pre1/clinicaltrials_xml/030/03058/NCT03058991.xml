	<brief_summary>The purpose current proposal investigate extent intervention design improve cognitive ( work memory ) emotional ( distress tolerance ) regulatory process enhance effectiveness standard no-smoking informational intervention . Emotional cognitive dysregulation increase likelihood smoking make particularly challenging benefit standard intervention . Working memory associate deficit make difficult individual utilize information intervention , make judicious decision regard cost benefit smoke , resist target advertising . In addition , disruption emotion regulatory capacity increase probability use cigarette cop mechanism self-regulate negative affect stress . Individuals affective disturbance smoke high rate difficulty quit , likely smoke way reduce negative affect . The goal current project generate new insight new approach smoke prevention among low-SES youth investigating ( 1 ) influence know SES-related deficit work memory affect regulation proximal measure smoke risk , ( 2 ) potential target intervention reverse risk . Specifically , investigator examine influence work memory training distress tolerance ( mindfulness ) intervention cognitive/affective target place individual risk smoke initiation maintenance . The specific aim study therefore investigate : 1 . The feasibility acceptability school- community-based brief intervention target work memory distress tolerance diverse sample low SES adolescent . 2 . The effect work memory distress tolerance intervention , relative standard informational intervention alone , specific cognitive-affective targetsâ€”delay discounting distress tolerance -- relevant cigarette smoke initiation maintenance . 3 . The impact cognitive /affective target activation proximal measure smoke risk/behavior relate health outcome follow intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overview . The investigator target high-risk ( low SES adolescent ) population highly relevant period ( high school ) smoking onset . The study design call block randomization 150 non-smoking adolescent one three intervention condition : ( 1 ) control condition offer health education combine smoke prevention informational intervention ( C+SPII ) , ( 2 ) Working Memory intervention deliver prior smoke prevention informational intervention ( WM+SPII ) , ( 3 ) Distress Tolerance Intervention deliver prior smoke prevention informational intervention ( DT+SPII ) . Smoking risk proximal outcome assess smoke propensity self-report , delay discounting , implicit association smoke ; smoke behavior assess one-month follow-up . Research material consist participant self-report smoking , peer smoking , parental smoking well self-report personality characteristic ( e.g . sensation seek ) associate risk behavior . Biological data ( exhalation ) also sample analysis CO , confirm non-smoking status . Location Interventions : At writing , investigator await funding confirmation decide among three option provide intervention high school . The investigator think plan follow three possibility : ( 1 ) school-time intervention select classroom space specific randomize intervention , ( 2 ) afterschool intervention open classroom space , ( 3 ) afterschool intervention community center . The investigator prefer option descend order ( 1 3 ) , final negotiation space pending ability confirm sit investigator indeed project ( obtained funding ) . For example , note application , `` headmaster Fenway High School , Peggy Kemp , extremely supportive work , plan provide institutional social support endeavor . '' In investigator ' meeting , suggest investigator try provide intervention school week ; noting intervention fit instructional demand either home room PE time . Use in-school instructional slot would require approval school superintendent , process obtain approval necessarily await confirmation funding . The letter support investigator obtain document unable realize option # 1 option # 2 , still realize project demand utilizing option # 3 . Interventions : Participants randomize ( use random number table utilizing variable block size ) 1 3 study condition accord two block randomization factor : sex parental smoking status . Each intervention deliver eight consecutive week . Interventions lead Project Director , Dr. Eugenia Gorlin , ongoing supervision Drs . Otto Doan . All intervention deliver group . Each study intervention deliver twice week eight consecutive week . The school year target high school student lend 8 wave intervention . With 30 individual per wave ( randomize 10 intervention give wave ) , investigator anticipate achieve full subject pool 5 wave . Group nest account analytic plan . The Smoking Prevention Informational Intervention ( SPII ) common randomize condition study . The investigator select intervention brief primary-care base intervention follow National Institutes Health U.S. Public Health Service Tobacco Use Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline . Youth provide age-appropriate education norm health consequence smoking , affirmation non-smoking status , help develop personalized strategy maintain abstinence . Additionally , investigator incorporate motivational interviewing component . Many element consistent element use youth MI program adolescent smoker Colby et al . ( 2005 ) . The investigator incorporate SPII intervention Colby associate ' guide imagery future smoking/non-smoking life status , initiation group session open-ended exploration perceive like dislike smoking , , 4 session , provision videotape vignette develop Massachusetts Department Public Health stimulate discussion four content area : health effect , social consequence , addiction , financial cost . The SPII deliver follow 3 specific intervention condition describe `` Study Arms '' section . All group 8 week training session , session schedule twice per week last 1 hour . Snacks serve training session . In addition , participant ask practice class skill ( e.g. , 20 min practice 3 time week ) outside session approximately 1 hour per week ( memory program , include scheduling time computer room provide study ) . Data Analysis Overview : The follow data analytic procedure plan current writing , may modify incorporate new , rigorous statistical modeling approach become available . 1 . The feasibility/ acceptability school- community-based brief intervention assess recruitment attendance rate across study period ; acceptability ( attendance 80 % intervention 70 % randomized sample ) assess across 3 condition . 2 . The investigator hypothesize WM+SPII DT+SPII intervention , relative C+SPII , lead high WM high DT , respectively . Further , investigator expect WM high WM+SPII DT+SPII , DT high DT+SPII WM+SPII . The latter contrast indicate two active treatment differ WM and/or DT ; perform latter analysis , investigator replace dummy variable contrast WM+SPII C+SPII , dummy variable compare WM+SPII DT+SPII . 3 . To evaluate impact cognitive/affective target activation proximal smoking risk/behavior follow intervention , WM DT add ( simultaneously ) time-varying predictor outcome MLM model 3 measure smoke risk ( susceptibility smoking , implicit attitude toward smoking , delay discount ) actual smoking behavior ( smoke behavior dichotomous , analyzed use GLMM logistic link function ) . The regression coefficient WM DT predict outcome model indicate degree relate smoking risk , control parallel change time variable outcomes . This approach calculate relation WN DT proximal measure smoke risk within subject time . The Benjamini-Hochberg method use correct multiple statistical test .</detailed_description>
