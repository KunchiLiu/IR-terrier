	<brief_summary>Physical activity intervention older adult improve brain health ; however intervention perform gym-like setting reach small sector senior population . Since everyone access gym , important study whether brisk walk real world environment also help brain health . This study use mobile health device help old adult independently walk brain health , thus represent critical step towards dissemination physical activity intervention program aim preserve cognitive function age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Physical activity intervention conduct supervised setting ( laboratory group setting ) old adult consistently show improved cardiovascular cerebrovascular health improve cognitive function . What lack development intervention take place real world environment take advantage new technology help objectively track real time physical activity behavior . Real world physical activity intervention potential reach large segment population enhance maintenance intervention period end . This study develop novel physical activity intervention use mobile health technology promote physical activity level likely affect cerebral blood flow cognition real world environment cognitively normal old adult . A randomized control trial conduct 30 participant assign mobile health physical activity condition ( walk free-living environment track via mobile health technology ) another 30 education control condition ( home reading healthy age material ) 3 month .</detailed_description>
