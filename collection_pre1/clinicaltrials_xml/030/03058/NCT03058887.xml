	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) multisystem connective tissue disease characterise vascular abnormality fibrosis , include skin categorise either Limited cutaneous scleroderma Diffuse cutaneous scleroderma . It estimate 90 % patient SSc experience Raynaud 's phenomenon ( RP ) regular interval course disease . Approximately 50 % patient SSc develop severe digital ischaemia and/or ulceration seem painful , difficult heal , susceptible infection heavily influence quality life increase SSc-related disability . Medical treatment commonly use effective first line approach NHS policy uncontrolled RP attack emerge . However , consider short-term side effect ( oedema , headache , heart palpitation , dizziness constipation ) also long-term side effect nifedipine ( heart dysfunction increase cardiovascular risk ) well financial cost approach , alternative approach less side effect less cost implication warrant . An alternative approach would implement programme therapeutic exercise would suitable patient group . To investigator knowledge efficacy exercise microcirculation RP previously examine . In regard , high intensity interval training ( HIIT ) come prominence last year effectiveness induce great improvement vascular function moderate intensity continuous training . Due variation HIIT protocols evidence limited support protocol effective SSc patient . Moreover , note chief aim research project encourage long-term adherence physical activity rehabilitation program patient might beneficial vascular function . A short HIIT protocol ( 30seconds/passive recovery ) may elicit favourable patient report satisfaction /enjoyment level compare longer exercise duration protocol . A short HIIT protocol ( 30seconds/passive recovery ) demonstrate well tolerate , prefer protocol low perception effort , patient comfort long time spend high percentage VÌ‡O2peak long HIIT protocol active recovery phase chronic heart failure patient . More recent evidence support notion ; enjoyment level overweight/obese cohort examine short HIIT protocol . Although know HIIT capable improve vascular function potentially microcirculatory parameter , evidence scarce regard mode exercise effective digital microcirculation RP attack present SSc patient . Assumptions could make utilise upper-body exercise would potentially beneficial digital microcirculation rather lower-body exercise work muscle promote blood flow low limb . Hence , differential effect may occur upper- lower-limb exercise digital microcirculation SSc patient examine . Resistance training ( RT ) alone show significant improvement function vasculature ; moreover , combination aerobic RT show past recently important enhances vascular function microcirculation . However , limited number study investigate effect RT vasculature bespeak lack concrete evidence . Moreover , investigator knowledge effect combine exercise ( RT aerobic exercise ) utilise HIIT protocol RT microcirculation yet examine . Aims : The primary aim present study examine feasibility exercise patient Systemic Sclerosis experience Raynaud 's Phenomenon .</brief_summary>
