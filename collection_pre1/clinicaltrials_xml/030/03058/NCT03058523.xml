	<detailed_description>Foods tend reject child include great importance later health fruit vegetable . Eating behaviour acceptance new taste , texture flavour young child influence plethora biological environmental factor . Infants inborn preference sweet umami flavour dislike sour bitter , evidence sensory experience begin early development positively modify preference favour ultimately healthy food choice . Babies first expose flavour swallowing amniotic fluid utero later breast formula milk . There evidence variety specie , include human , show manipulate particularly late pregnancy influence subsequent liking consumption individual food specific high intensity flavour potentially . However , lack prospective study evaluate impact increase maternal fruit vegetable intake late pregnancy child 's subsequent acceptance fruit vegetable , particularly bitter taste . The hypothesis intervention increase maternal intake fruit vegetable late pregnancy , woman normally struggle achieve 5-a-day , enhance fetal flavour exposure make infant likely accept wide variety fruit vegetable childhood . Before test hypothesis design main study , investigator need ensure component part feasible : central evaluate general acceptance taste profile fruit vegetable ( F &amp; V ) format intend offer mother . A range innovative presentation format variety pungent fruit vegetable currently develop . These include soup , sauce , crispbreads , muffin smoothy incorporate vegetable and/or fruit generally consider bitter sour tasting . A recent scoping survey woman childbearing age confirm prior observation sex vegetable bitter profile less preferred / likely never try , compare sweet variety . The survey also reveal vegetable largely consume cooked part meal . Accordingly F &amp; V format evaluate predominantly pre-cooked design warm microwave avoid destruction leach flavour zealous cooking . Although survey reveal low consumption vegetable smoothie form snack , may due lack easy availability hence number include potentially increase diversity dietary format flavour exposure . This application primarily palatability trial establish taste profile general acceptability diverse F &amp; V presentation format two group : non-pregnant woman childbearing age , follow pregnant woman . As perception taste ( particularly bitter , sweet umami ) may vary individual depend genetic variation certain taste receptor gene , propose characterise relevant genotype buccal sample relate habitual diet F &amp; V preference . The utility non-invasive sample route measure expression gene involve taste perception also determine use tongue swab desirable feature potentially scrutinising impact propose intervention taste perception mother infant also require assessed ahead design main intervention study .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>For nonpregnant cohort : woman childbearing age major health issue currently struggle meet recommend 5 portion fruit vegetable per day . For pregnant cohort : woman &gt; 16 &lt; 32 week pregnant ( major health issue ) currently struggle meet recommend 5 portion fruit vegetable per day . Men anyone unable understand participant information sheet and/or speak , read understand English language ( investigator resource translate material ) Women know food allergies/intolerances smoker , vegetarian vegans Anyone use medication know impact taste perception e.g . asthma inhaler Anyone hormone imbalance metabolic disease impact ability taste Anyone history eat disorder Pregnant woman history recur miscarriage diagnosis hyperemesis gravidarium ( severe nausea vomit ) , gestational diabetes gestational hypertension major pregnancy complication .</criteria>
