	<brief_summary>This study evaluate intratumoral administration escalate dos novel , experimental drug , INT230-6 . The study conduct patient several type refractory cancer include surface skin ( melanoma , head neck , lymphoma , breast ) tumor within body ( pancreatic , colon , liver , lung , etc. ) . Sponsor also plan test INT230-6 combination anti-PD-1 antibody .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2 Safety Study Intratumorally Dosed INT230-6</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INT230-6 comprise 3 agent fix ratio - cell permeation enhancer two , potent anti-cancer payload ( cisplatin vinblastine sulfate ) . The penetration enhancer facilitate dispersion two drug throughout injected tumor enables increase diffusion cancer cell . ( Nonclinical safety study show finding follow drug injection healthy tissue . ) Historically physicians administer two active drug comprise INT230-6 intravenous ( IV ) infusion achieve systemic blood level limit tolerability . The objective destroy visible tumor unseen circulate cancer cell ( micro-metastases ) . Unfortunately , dose drug IV delivers small amount low concentration tumor site . This approach especially late stage cancer highly effective often quite toxic patient . Attempts direct intratumoral injection chemotherapeutic agent show ability treat injected tumor , non-injected tumor micro-metastases . This lack efficacy local administration due possibly poor dispersion lack cell uptake agent . Due use novel cell penetration enhance agent INT230-6 treatment demonstrate strong efficacy animal large tumor . The Sponsor 's vivo , non-clinical data show INT230-6 thoroughly saturate kill injected tumor . In addition , drug induces adaptive ( T-cell mediate ) immune response attack inject tumor , non-injected tumor unseen micro-metastases . Cured animals become permanently immunized type cancer INT230-6 eliminate . Clinical trial IT-01 thus seek determine safety potential efficacy dose INT230-6 directly several different type cancer . In addition animal study show strong synergy INT230-6 immune modulation agent . Thus part study IT-01 Sponsor seek understand safety efficacy INT230-6 administer combination immuno-therapeutic agent antibody target Programmed Cell Death ( PD-1 anti-PD-1 ) receptor . This study seek understand whether tumor regression achieve patient outcomes improve .</detailed_description>
