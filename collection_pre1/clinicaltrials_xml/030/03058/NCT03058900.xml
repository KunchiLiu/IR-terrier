	<detailed_description>Recent year see grow recognition complexity role microbiota shape immune system potential effect health disease . In particular , gut bacteria composition associate pathogenesis autoimmune inflammatory disease . Intriguingly , presence intestinal inflammation psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) patient document several study . Also , genetically predispose patient reactive arthritis , share clinical manifestation PsA , trigger certain type bacterial gut infection . Furthermore , recent study report several intestinal bacteria include Akkermansia Ruminoccocus , know play important role maintain gut homeostasis , practically absent PsA patient . Mechanisms microbiota may involve pathogenesis PsA include abnormal activation gut-associated lymphoid tissue ( GALT ) and/or alter mucosal permeability thus compromise capacity intestine provide adequate containment luminal microorganism molecule . By conduct double-blinded , randomize , placebo-controlled trial non-related donor fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) infuse small intestine , study reveal whether FMT effective identically appear placebo ( saline ) reduce disease activity psoriatic arthritis patient present minimum three swollen joint despite least three month s.c. methotrexate treatment ( maximal tolerable dosis ≥ 15 mg/week ) . All patient throughout study continue individual treatment weekly s.c. methotrexate .</detailed_description>
