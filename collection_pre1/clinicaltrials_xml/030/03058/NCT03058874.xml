	<brief_summary>The common co-morbidity accompany Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) hypertension , appear approximately 80 % patient renal dysfunction , whereas prevalence general population remarkably lower appear approximately 30 % adults.Defining hypertension ESRD patient maintenance dialysis challenging procedure . Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) consider `` gold standard '' diagnosis hypertension hemodialysis patient last year . The major pathophysiologic mechanism underlie hypertension development patient ESRD hemodialysis water sodium overload . Identifying accurate objective method dry weight evaluation matter intensive nephrology research two decade . Assessment water balance hemodialysis patient basis common clinical criterion ( e.g . leg face swell sign lung congestion ) subjective method limited reliability , despite widespread use . Recently , novel technique develop quantify water excess conduct ultrasound lung scan . Pilot study show significant change lung water hemodialysis patient accord body weight change interdialytic day dialysis session . Moreover , result previous study indicate significant benefit dry weight probe regard blood pressure ( BP ) . The clinical application lung-ultrasound-based volume control strategy hemodialysis patient currently test randomize study entitle `` Lung water ultrasound guide treatment prevent death cardiovascular complication high risk end stage renal disease patient cardiomyopathy ( The LUST Study ) '' . This clinical trial aim evaluate whether use number US-B line could use biomarker guide per-protocol intensification ultrafiltration ( UF ) order reduce volume overload , improve cardiac function prolong survival . Cardiovascular disease patient CKD attribute spectrum structural functional alteration large small branch arterial tree . The important process patient advance CKD arteriosclerosis , develop parallel atherosclerosis typically associate impaired cushioning function aorta large conduit artery . Accelerated arterial stiffen involve development isolate systolic hypertension , leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , predispose arrhythmia sudden cardiac death . In context phenomenon `` aortic-to-brachial BP amplification '' , systolic BP ( SBP ) pulse pressure ( PP ) conventionally measure level brachial artery higher relevant pressure ascend aorta . Due extreme elevation arterial stiffness , BP amplification disturb patient ESRD . Prospective cohort study demonstrate elevated central PP , wave reflection arterial stiffness , well , reduce PP amplification represent strong independent predictor all-cause cardiovascular mortality hemodialysis patient . On basis , estimation central BP index appear important tool towards optimisation cardiovascular risk stratification ESRD well diseased population . Until recently , available device ABPM evaluate BP level level brachial artery . The newly develop Mobil-O-Graph NG ( IEM , Stolberg , Germany ) provide ability monitor central aortic pressure index vascular resistance , wave reflection ( augmentation index , AIx ) arterial stiffness ( pulse wave velocity , PWV ) .This device recently validate hemodialysis patient show comparable performance widely use tonometric SphygmoCor device ( ArtCor , Sydney , Australia ) . Accumulated evidence central BP PWV hemodialysis patient derive mostly study include static pre-dialysis post-dialysis measurement . However , variation BP level intra- interdialytic interval combine superiority aortic BP measurement , analyse , indicate ambulatory monitor central BP best available method . This study aim first time evaluate outcome treatment strategy dry weight probe , base volume overload quantification lung ultrasound , 24-hour aortic systolic BP arterial stiffness hemodialysis hypertensive patient . This Lust Sub-Study . Additional information find : NCT02310061 .</brief_summary>
