	<detailed_description>Surgical trauma cause release damage-associated molecular pattern ( DAMPs ) alarmines ( e.g . HMGB-1 ) target receptor local cell innate immune system , macrophage . This cellular response trauma follow rapid release array inflammatory mediator ( e.g . TNFα , IL-1B , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 ) dependent intracellular activation nuclear factor NF-kB . Until recently believe brain protect cascade inflammatory mediator primarily due intact blood-brain-barrier ( BBB ) . However , grow body evidence long term impairment brain function associate trauma-induced activation brain innate immune system subsequent impairment higher cognitive process risk later permanent dementia . Yet , link systemic inflammation cognitive impairment fully understood . Recent study map periphery-to-brain-signaling surgical trauma impact major surgical trauma human brain serial PET-imaging . In series surgical patient , profound biphasic change brain immune activity surgery demonstrate major abdominal surgery sign early depression follow increase immune activity 3 month postoperatively . These biphasic change brain immunity seem align simultaneous change whole blood immune reactivity LPS suggest close link brain peripheral immune system regulation acute inflammation immune response . Preclinical work surgical animal model indicate disruption BBB migration peripheral macrophage brain pathway potential importance . Evidence orthopedic surgery model mice trauma-induced altered hippocampal neuro-immune activity raise question whether peripheral marker neurodegeneration ( S100b , neurofilament light NFL , ptau , beta-amyloid ) associate POCD . The immune-regulatory role brain via cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex pathway ( mediated vagal nerve ) identify potential target immune-modulatory treatment strategy systemic inflammation . We moreover demonstrate distinct release human carotid body inflammatory mediator hypoxia gene expression relate inflammatory mediator , suggest potential role human carotid body periphery-to-brain immune-signaling . Modulation vagal nerve-derived inflammatory reflex pathway electrical stimulation recently successfully apply treatment chronic inflammation among patient rheumatoid arthritis . The hypothesis vagal nerve activity modulate systemic inflammation patient major surgery modulation associate cognitive performance postoperative period . With comprehensive understand immune-to-brain signal surgical trauma biphasic inflammatory response pattern regulate cellular neuronal component , impact immune modulation key process behind surgery-induced brain dysfunction explore , possible neural humoral target relevant anti-inflammatory treatment establish . In abdominal surgery patient map inflammatory periphery-to-brain communication description temporal association brain regulation peripheral immunity ( i.e. , temporal change vagal nerve activity measure serial measurement heart rate variability ) , repeat blood reactivity LPS serial ex vivo LPS challenge simultaneous plasma/serum-borne CNS inflammatory brain injury biomarkers explore impact change systemic brain immune function surgery long-term cognitive performance .</detailed_description>
