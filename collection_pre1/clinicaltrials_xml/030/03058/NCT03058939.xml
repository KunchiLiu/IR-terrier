	<brief_summary>This two-stage phase II study single arm design . It conduct woman breast cancer stag IIA IIIC ( define AJCC 2009 classification ) histological subtypes . All patient receive 16 dos paclitaxel ; three breast ultrasound test tumor pathologic response evaluation use assess response treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each patient assign one follow group : 1 ) complete response , 2 ) partial response , 3 ) stable disease , 4 ) progressive disease , 5 ) early death malignant disease , 6 ) early death toxicity , 7 ) early death cause , 8 ) unknown ( assessable , insufficient data ) . Patients good response 8 dos paclitaxel ( complete response partial response operable ) receive additional 8 course paclitaxel chemotherapy surgery radiotherapy . The overall response patient assess ultrasonography total 16 week Taxol therapy . Patients poor response ( define stable disease progressive disease partial response inoperable ) best response eight weekly course paclitaxel receive 8 cycle weekly PC . The overall response patient also assess ultrasonography 8 course PC therapy . Patients poor response 8 course paclitaxel follow 8 course PC base ultrasound assessment regard fail respond treatment . These patient receive 4 cycle 3-weekly FEC follow . Patients response group 4-8 consider failing respond treatment . All conclusion base eligible patient . The schema study present Figures 4-1 , 4-2 4-3 . Patients global deterioration health status require discontinuation treatment without objective evidence disease progression time classify `` symptomatic deterioration '' . Every effort make document objective progression even discontinuation treatment . All Premenopausal patient receive LHRH agonist two year contraception fertility preservation . Hormone-receptor positive patient receive hormonal therapy tamoxifen letrozole surgery , radiotherapy LHRH agonist accord expression hormone receptor ER PgR ( see glossary section 10.3 ) accord state primary menopause ( see glossary ) onset study . Patients HER2-positive disease ( see glossary section 10.3 ) receive 5 threeweekly course trastuzumab ( Herceptin SC ) pertuzumab ( Perjeta ) . After pt continue receive trastuzumab complete total 18 dos within 1 year treatment . The study design estimate RR breast cancer patient weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy determine RR weekly PC combination chemotherapy patient resistant poor response ( include early progression ) weekly single agent paclitaxel .</detailed_description>
