	<brief_title>Sensorimotor Retraining Chronic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Somatosensory deficit common symptom stroke , affect high percentage survivor ( 50-80 % ) . These impairment long-term influence somatosensory capacity , motor ability functional performance . Although several author study effect sensorimotor retrain recovery paretic upper limb , investigated effect paretic low limb . Furthermore , do acute subacute phase stroke . Thus , field lack study high methodological quality provide effective physiotherapeutic intervention , especially chronic stroke . On hand , importance motor recovery paretic low limb order achieve good balance , gait independence activity daily live well establish . In regard , sensory loss foot may difficult effective motor function recovery due impact upon ambulatory activity . After stroke , sensory dysfunction lower limb related reduction static dynamic balance well gait speed symmetry . Therefore , successful recovery sensory function stroke may allow appropriate integration sensory input order maintain balance adapt change environmental demand gait . Since current evidence indicates may recovery sensory loss chronic phase stroke , present study aim evaluate effect sensorimotor retrain program sensory functional recovery paretic low limb chronic stroke . The investigator hypothesize stroke survivor receive somatosensory training program would demonstrate significantly great improvement sensation , static dynamic balance gait pattern comparison control intervention . To cope objective study , prospective randomize double-blind clinical trial conduct . By mean advertisement support group , rehabilitation facility external consultation various hospital , subject meet inclusion criterion recruit . After screen give signed consent , participant randomly allocate intervention group control group . In addition usual physical activity , participant complete fifteen 40-minute session sensorimotor retrain ( intervention group ) Jacobson relaxation ( control group ) 5-week period . Participants assess prior treatment completion treatment .</detailed_description>
