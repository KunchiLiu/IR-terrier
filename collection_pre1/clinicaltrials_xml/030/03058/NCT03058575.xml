	<detailed_description>The human body home trillion microbe , show play important role many aspect human biology , immune function metabolism . Research area primarily focus role dietary factor modulate gastrointestinal ( GI ) microbiota associate change host health parameter . Specifically , dietary microbiota accessible carbohydrate ( MACs ) , include compound resistant starch dietary fiber typically resistant digestion , show serve primary source energy distal gut microbiota . Metabolism MACs GI microbiota important shape microbial ecosystem . A Western diet , typically low MAC content ( e.g. , dietary fiber ) , associate marked reduction microbial diversity depletion specific type potentially beneficial microbe . Until recently , bulk microbiota study conduct animal , human study GI microbiota focus primarily delineate gut bacterial composition correspond change taxonomy response particular dietary intervention ( e.g. , prebiotics ) . Additionally , investigation dietary factor influence skin ( scalp ) oral cavity microbiomes recently garner attention . Human intervention study increase consumption dietary MACs need well understand change composition function bacteria influence host parameter .</detailed_description>
