	<detailed_description>The frequency twin pregnancy increase significantly , especially assist reproduction advance maternal age conception . The twin pregnancy responsible 25 % preterm birth . Consequently , twin pregnancy associate perinatal mortality morbidity compare single pregnancy . Additionally , short cervix ( &lt; 25 mm ) singleton twin pregnancy associate significantly increase preterm birth . Randomized controlled trial singleton pregnancy report profilatic cervical cerclage vaginal progesterone reduce significantly rate early preterm birth . In twin pregnancy , vaginal progesterone profilatic cerclage show ineffective prevention preterm birth . However , two individual pacient data meta-analyses report subgroup woman twin pregancies short cervix , vaginal progesterone reduce significantly adverse neonatal outcome . Nowadays , effet cervical pessary contraditory , mainly woman short cervix . This randomized prospective trial SÃ£o Paulo University Medical School . This trial involve 312 woman twin pregnancy short cervix 16 27 week 6 day gestacional age . Women twin pregnancy short cervix ( define accord gestacional age ) assign randomly daily vaginal progesterone ( 400mg ) combine insertion cervical pessary , isolate use daily vaginal progesterone ( 400mg ) isolate insertion cervical pessary expectant management ( intervention ) . The primary outcome compare rate spontaneous delivery &lt; 34 week gestacion groups.The secondary outcome compare neonatal adverse outcome group . The aim study test hypothesis insertion cervical pessary combine vaginal progesterone , twin pregnancy short cervix would reduce spontaneus preterm birth &lt; 34 week ' gestation .</detailed_description>
