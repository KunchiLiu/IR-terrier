	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bifurcation lesion common lesion subset PCI account 15-20 % total number intervention ( 1 ) . Treatment coronary artery bifurcation lesion represent challenge area interventional cardiology ( 2 ) . When compare non-bifurcation intervention , bifurcation intervention low rate procedural success , high procedural cost , long hospitalization higher clinical angiographic restenosis ( 3 ) . Factors contribute adverse outcome include limitation angiography assessment side-branch ( SB ) disease severity lack establish angiographic predictor SB patency lumen compromise . Better understand underlie plaque morphology plaque composition may facilitate effective treatment bifurcation lesion . Heavy calcification within coronary atherosclerotic plaque adversely influence clinical procedural success percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) ( 4,5 ) . The use drug-eluting stent ( DES ) calcify lesion pose special challenge . Atherectomy facilitate successful stent delivery expansion calcify lesion . Orbital atherectomy ( OA ) newly FDA approve device treatment severely calcify coronary lesion work principle elliptical burr movement . The ORBIT I II clinical trial evaluate safety OA de novo calcified coronary lesion demonstrate complication rate comparable historical control rotational atherectomy ( 6 ) . Intravascular image provide new understanding mechanism associate SB compromise follow bifurcation PCI ( 7-9 ) . Plaque shift traditionally consider principal mechanism side-branch compromise main vessel intervention ( 9 ) , however recent intravascular imaging study provide new insight suggest carina shift major mechanism implicate side-branch closure ( 7 ) . Intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) use guidance bifurcation lesion , aid visualization plaque morphology main vessel side-branches help selection stent size length well selection stenting strategy . However , due low spatial resolution IVUS , attempt three-dimensional visualization focus visualization luminal contour vessel morphology vessel-stent interaction . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) ~10 time high resolution IVUS allow precise evaluation microstructure vessel wall include lipid pool , fibrous cap , calcification , thrombus ( 10 ) . In addition , provide immediate automate measurement lumen dimension treatment precise evaluation strut apposition stent expansion stenting , particular interest bifurcation PCI , since 's associate high number malapposed stent strut frequent stent underexpansion lead high incidence stent thrombosis restenosis . OCT show constitute valuable tool PCI guidance also utility three-dimensional ( 3D ) rendering assess mechanism side-branch compromise follow intervention bifurcation lesion . ( 11,12 ) . The recent development OCT online 3D reconstruction allows operator obtain 3D visualization lesion may provide unique tool guidance complex bifurcation PCI potentially improve stenting result ( 12 ) . 3D OCT use visualize jailed side branch implantation bioresorbable scaffold main branch develop new classification system base number SB compartment ( 13 ) . In addition , potential clinical application guide rewire distal compartment SB ostium ( jailed stent strut MB stenting ) minimize risk float strut demonstrate . The aim study analyze outcome main vessel stenting side branch calcify bifurcation lesion identify preprocedural predictor side branch complication utilize two-dimensional ( 2D ) three-dimensional ( 3D ) frequency domain optical coherence tomography ( FD-OCT ) . Thirty consecutive patient calcify lesion require PCI main vessel drug elute stent implantation treatment stable CAD include study . All potential subject sign separate Mount Sinai surgical/procedure inform consent Cardiac Catheterization procedure day hospital visit . Patients undergo coronary angiogram . OCT perform analyze plaque morphology , extent location calcification , side branch size , angle , ostial involvement . Patients undergo PCI stent implantation accord current standard care . Lesion preparation include lesion pre-dilation , use atherectomy protection device perform operator 's discretion , follow MV stenting . The operator also decide length size implanted stent . Procedural optimization , post-dilation additional stent implantation perform base angiographic finding , accord discretion operator . Coronary angiogram another OCT pullback perform PCI .</detailed_description>
