Briefly , full length CETA include 12 weekly treatment session comprise cognitive behavioral element . In last year , researcher identify mental health intervention successfully reduce burden symptom client low-resource setting , push develop intervention model scalable . One barrier scalability may duration treatment , client may complete treatment many session , counselor may limit number client treat course year client require session . However , trade-off potential reduction treatment efficacy evaluate shortened- versus standard-length treatment model efficacious intervention . This study begin address test see long short version CETA effective compare wait-control condition . Community provider three trial site ( Kyiv , Kharkiv , Zaporizhia ) begin ongoing training CETA counselor local supervisor . This study conduct 3-armed randomized control trial . Adult IDPs , Ukrainian military veteran , family member 3 Ukrainian city , Kyiv , Kharkiv , Zaporizhia , recruit rolling basis screen identify elevate depression and/or posttraumatic stress ( PTS ) symptom impair function use locally validate assessment instrument . Local non-governmental organization ( NGOs ) exist service provider provide locally validate short clinical assessment instrument ( develop previous phase current research ) . As part regular service , organization use instrument ass clientele need specific clinical service . If assessment suggest person need service person agree seek help refer study 's monitoring evaluation ( M &amp; E ) staff meet potential participant conduct repeat screen ensure trial eligibility . Those meet eligibility criterion second screen consent study . All eligible consent adult randomly allocate either wait-list control condition , Brief CETA model , Full CETA model . After randomization , allocate either CETA arm refer one local counselor supervisor , train version CETA ( Brief Full ) . purpose blind allocate CETA arm ( counselor ) aware whether receive full CETA ( 12 session ) short CETA ( 5 session ) . This information reveal provider client 4 session , plan either end treatment 5th session continue . All study participant 3 arm assess monthly basis 6 month post-baseline . After completion participation trial assign wait-control condition able receive CETA service . At 1st monthly data collection point post treatment completion , study participant short CETA long CETA intervention arm also interview use Client Dissemination Implementation Research ( D &amp; I ) instrument explore aspects program implementation client perspective . In addition , first 30 participant ( total N=60 ) complete version CETA also ask provide qualitative interview upon completion treatment explore unexpected effect program , positive negative . Data D &amp; I interview use improve program . Data qualitative interview also use generate additional locally important item add study impact assessment instrument . This expanded version instrument complete later study participant . CETA provider ( counselor supervisor ) interview 6 month provide CETA service use Provider Dissemination Implementation ( D &amp; I ) instrument qualitative interview . The purpose provider D &amp; I instrument similar client , provider perspective ( i.e. , identify aspect program implementation change order improve program ) . The purpose qualitative interview D &amp; I instrument identify unknown factor affect implementation refer instrument . important local information latter add D &amp; I instrument included report qualitative data . Primary Aim : 1 . To determine effectiveness 2 version CETA ( brief : 5 session ; full : 12 session ) comparison wait-list control condition reduce severity depression posttraumatic stress symptom improve daily function experience IDPs veteran Ukraine . Secondary Aims : 2 . To explore effectiveness version CETA comparison wait-list control condition reduce anxiety symptom severity reduce substance abuse ( alcohol drug ) among IDPs veteran Ukraine . 3 . To explore provider participant level factor affect CETA implementation .</detailed_description>
