	<brief_title>Henry Ford Heart Score Randomized Trial : Rapid Discharge Patients Evaluated Possible Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized , control trial conduct February 2014 May 2015 design quantify reduction cost length stay early discharge emergency department patient evaluate acute myocardial infarction , deem low risk base modified HEART score . Our study enrol deem low risk , patient believe best served utilization HEART score decision aid . A total 105 patient evaluate AMI ED modify HEART score â‰¤ 3 ( include cardiac troponin I &lt; 0.04 ng/ml 0 3 hour ) randomize immediate discharge ( n = 53 ) v management observation unit stress test ( n = 52 ) . The primary endpoint 30-day total cost length stay . Secondary endpoint all-cause death , nonfatal AMI , rehospitalization evaluation possible AMI , coronary revascularization 30 day . That early discharge strategy would decrease cost length stay intuitively expect ; goal quantify reduction .</detailed_description>
