	<brief_summary>On Intensive Care Unit doctor give lot fluid patient order improve blood pressure , amount urine make let doctor stop drug need keep blood pressure . Doctors normally give patient 500ml fluid 25 minute standard , however difficult know give fluid much fluid help ( others ) . If person get much fluid also cause problem fluid lung , poor kidney function , swell limb . The LidCo Rapid monitor let Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) team know amount blood heart push beat ( Stroke volume ) . It work follow trace arterial line ( Blood pressure monitor ) insert part standard care patient ICU . It need invasive procedure drug administration work . This study use monitor see identify method improve administration intravenous fluid Intensive Care Unit . The study look see identify whether give small amount fluid first identifies people benefit fluid wo n't .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adult patient Consultant Intensivist decides receive fluid challenge part standard care order improve haemodynamic parameter approach . Reasons fluid administration include evidence inadequate tissue perfusion raise blood lactate poor urine output , hypotension attempt wean vasopressor dose . Patients identify suitable inclusion Consultant Responsible Intensive Care Unit day . As fluid responsiveness transient phenomenon disappear significant fluid resuscitation propose patient immediately enter study study contain mix fluid responsive non-responsive patient order get time critical data require may lose significant delay study entry . Informed consent seek patient , incapacitated critical illness , relative approach assent soon possible within 48 hour study enrollment . This line recommendation Research involve emergency treatment . The LiDCOrapid machine connect manner LiDCOplus machine , currently use ICU , order obtain stroke volume measurement . A smartcard insert patient detail enter . Monitoring continue fluid clinically indicate . Patients give fluid bolus via either peripheral central venous catheter . The following data collect patient : Age , Gender , Height , Weight , diagnosis require ICU admission , location venous arterial catheter , APACHE II score , Cumulative fluid balance time bolus administration , Ventilation status ( self-ventilating , non-invasive ventilation , invasive ventilation mode appropriate ) , tidal volume measure , drug infuse ( sedative , inotropes , vasoactive drug , diuretic , muscle relaxant , etc ) , presence renal replacement therapy . Fluid administration protocol : Patients monitor prior infusion hemodynamic stability , Standard practice administer bolus 500ml give via infusion pump rate 1200mL/hour ( 25min ) . For study patient first 250ml give 50ml bolus use 50ml syringe . Each bolus give approximately 1 minute study measurement record follow wait response 1 minute . This repeated subsequent bolus 250ml give ( i.e . 5 bolus ) . The remain 250ml give via standard infusion pump method rate 1000ml/hour complete 15 minute . In total , 500ml give 25 minute . At end bolus Stroke volume , cardiac output , heart rate , blood pressure determine . Up 2 set data per patient per day collect . The majority patient routinely stay ICU 2 day , small group , much longer . A maximum 4 data set collect per patient . The fluid boluses administer discretion treat physician believe improve clinical condition patient . The study team influence timing .</detailed_description>
