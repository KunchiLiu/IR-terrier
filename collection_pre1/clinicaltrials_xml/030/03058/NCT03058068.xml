	<detailed_description>Primary objective demonstrate safety Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSCs ) intravenously administer subject cystic fibrosis . Secondary Objective explore MSCs improve symptom cystic fibrosis , include lung function , rate pulmonary exacerbation , systemic local inflammation symptom-related quality life . The Safety Run-In perform evaluate safety MSC infusion subject cystic fibrosis . 3 subject participate receive single administration allogeneic MSCs give intravenous infusion . In randomized phase subject randomize ratio 1:1:1 3 cohort receive infusion . There total 15 subject 3 cohort . The total duration subject infusion 12 month , plus additional 2 month Screening Baseline Visits . Approximately 9 visit total .</detailed_description>
