	<brief_summary>When infection strike , body 's immune system react produce chemical bloodstream change white blood cell attack infect organism ( bacteria , virus organisms ) prevent spread . This term 'inflammatory response ' . Though beneficial fight infection , response sometimes excessive , cause harmful effect body organs . This termed 'systemic inflammatory response syndrome ' link infection term 'sepsis ' . Previous research show patient sepsis , small blood vessel supply oxygen nutrient muscle organ ( microcirculation ) become abnormal function would health . However , difficult ass function microcirculation clinical practice , want find new , easy way . The aim study test new method assess function small blood vessel , directly visualise use highly sensitive microscope , size pen , place tongue . By understand flow blood vessel healthy individual , gain well understanding vessel affect illness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Establishing Normal Ranges Microcirculatory Function Determined CytoCam-IDF Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Sepsis highly heterogeneous disease state bring dysregulated host response systemic infection , uncontrolled pro- anti-inflammatory process lead collateral tissue injury immune suppression . Sepsis pose significant health burden worldwide , death attribute UK estimate approximately 44,000 per annum . Prompt treatment direct internationally agree management guideline improve outcomes sepsis . However early diagnosis sepsis remain difficult , current diagnostic criterion rely presence organ dysfunction derangement macro haemodynamic variable . At point diagnosis , mortality excess 10 % . At present specific criterion diagnosis sepsis base underlying pathophysiological abnormality , specifically assessment microcirculation . The microcirculation sepsis The microcirculation consist dense network arteriole , capillary venule , whose diameter le 150 um . Its function supply nutrient oxygen aerobic metabolism reduce cellular waste product . Sepsis affect element microcirculation , microcirculatory dysfunction play important role pathophysiology severe sepsis septic shock . Sepsis associate decreased capillary density increase perfusion heterogeneity lead decrease oxygen delivery , tissue hypoxia subsequently organ dysfunction . Changes microcirculatory function may precede traditional diagnostic feature sepsis , provide early information patient go develop severe sepsis multi-organ failure . Recognition sepsis early stage would allow prompt treatment , aim restore homeostasis microcirculation , therefore alter disease progression . A number study demonstrate improvement microcirculatory function follow early resuscitation associate decrease organ dysfunction , patient whose microcirculations fail improve follow resuscitation poorer outcome . Despite recognition importance microcirculation sepsis , current goal-directed end point rely monitor restoration global measure cardiovascular/organ function ( e.g . heart rate , blood pressure , urine output , lactate ) , partly microcirculation difficult monitor clinical practice . However , improvement macro haemodynamic variable guarantee restoration microcirculatory homeostasis . Clinical assessment microcirculatory function presently inferred measurement by-product generate due impaired oxygenation/metabolism lactate carbon dioxide . Video microscopic technique assessment microcirculation Video microscopic technique provide in-vivo visualisation microcirculation , allow direct measurement capillary density , perfusion flow dynamic . Until recently , technique include Orthogonal Polarization Spectral ( OPS ) image Sidestream Dark Field ( SDF ) imaging , clinically inaccessible owe bulky nature , operator dependant output time-consuming offline analysis requirement . A third-generation handheld microscope recently develop ( CytoCam-IDF , Braedius Medical , NL ) , utilise Incident Dark Field ( IDF ) illumination . The device incorporate real-time automated digital image analysis , combine high resolution lenses computer control image sensor improve resolution . The CytoCam also feature novel quantitative focusing mechanism integrate distance measure system , whereby focus depth establish specific patient , serial measurement make without manually readjust focus , improve speed ease measurement . This new device performs well compare previous device , provide improve contrast image sharpness allow increased number microvessels visualise . Crucially , CytoCam equip bespoke software allow image store analyse automatically point acquisition . Microcirculatory monitor new technique , combination user friendly ergonomics , accurate image acquisition automate analysis open potentially useful direct measurement microcirculatory function bedside clinical practice . Analysis sublingual microcirculation A round table discussion 2006 expert field , seek clarify feature include microcirculatory analysis , conclude assessment microcirculation include measure vascular density , assessment capillary perfusion heterogeneity index ( vessel &lt; 20 micrometres diameter ) . These measured variable : Microvascular Flow Index ( MFI ) - Perfusion quality Image divide quadrant . A number assign quadrant accord predominant flow type ( 0 = flow , 1 = intermittent , 2 = sluggish , 3 = continuous ) . The MFI result mean 4 value . Total Vessel Density ( TVD ) Vessel density - The total length vessel divide total surface area analyse area . Perfused Vessel Density ( PVD ) - Functional vessel density Total length perfuse vessel ( MFI score 2/3 ) divide analysed area . Proportional Perfused Vessels ( PPV ) - Perfusion quality 100 x number perfuse vessel divide total number vessel Heterogeneity Index ( HI ) Measure heterogeneity flow vessel . Highest MFI - low MFI divide mean MFI across site analyse Compared healthy volunteer , patient sepsis display low value PVD , PPV MFI , along increase heterogeneity index , irrespective macro haemodynamic condition . Total capillary density appear unaffected sepsis . These finding corroborate International Study Microcirculatory Shock Occurrence Acutely Ill Patients ( microSOAP ) study . The microSOAP study date large trial investigate significance microcirculatory alteration heterogeneous ICU population ( i.e . sepsis ) . Using previous generation similar technology , investigator find 501 patient included analysis , 86 ( 17 % ) abnormal MFI ( define priori &lt; 2.6 ) . Of abnormal MFI , HI increase decrease PPV PVD . Total vessel density affect . Abnormal MFI conjunction tachycardia associate increased mortality ( OR 3.24 ) . CytoCam Tools automate analysis CytoCam Tools proprietary software supply aforementioned microcirculatory monitor . It utilise new analysis technique term Capillary Network Analysis ( CNA ) whereby microcirculation analyse automatically user-independent nature two-stage process include automatic vessel detection ( depend diameter visualise vessel ) , follow assessment speed red blood cell vessel identify . The following microcirculatory variable automatically determine . - Total Vessel Density ( TVD ) - Total length detect vessel divide processed area . - Speed Index ( SI ) - Relative number derive intensity variation along centreline vessel , describes speed detect vessel . - Perfused Speed Index ( PSI ) - SI vessel SI high perfusion threshold ( PT ) . - Average Perfused Speed Indicator ( APSI ) - Sum PSI value divide total number perfuse vessel . - Proportion perfuse vessel ( PPV ) - Total length vessel SI high PT , divide total length detect vessel x 100 , - Perfused Vessel Density ( PVD ) - Total length vessel SI high PT divide processed area . - Average Perfused Speed Indicator Heterogeneity Index ( APSI HI ) - Image divide quadrant APSI derive quadrant . APSI high minus low APSI divide mean APSI quadrant . The assessment PPV PVD relies automate analysis red blood cell speed identify vessel . In order achieve predetermine Perfusion Threshold ( PT ) set . The PT describe state flow within identify vessel range 0 infinite . Manufacture assessment determine PT 1 consistent `` perfused condition '' subdivide follow : Perfusion threshold State flow 0 - 1 = No flow 1 - 5 = Sluggish 5 great = Good flow Normal range automatically measure variable health currently unknown . Understanding normal range would allow u utilise technique future study concern early diagnosis septic illness . Identification patient early stage pathophysiological process sepsis development traditionally diagnostic macro-circulatory abnormality may allow early implementation treatment . Rationale The CytoCam system may represent step towards user-friendly , reproducible , clinically applicable approach measuring , act upon change microvascular function improve clinical outcome . However , normal range measurement know , without study take place . This study identify normal range automatically determine measurement derive CytoCam system healthy subject , open new opportunity study , anticipate aim early identification patient microcirculatory dysfunction ( find sepsis ) ; whose microcirculatory parameter fall outside newly define range . This first step move towards routine bedside microcirculatory monitoring intensive care unit . This work build project currently progress within Diagnostic Development Unit ( DDU ) base Leicester Royal Infirmary . The DDU University Leicester inter-collegiate project Medicine , Space Science Atmospheric Chemistry , explore use novel non-invasive monitor Emergency Medicine Critical Care . Population study OBJECTIVE To identify normal range automatically measure microcirculatory variable determine CytoCam system different adult age group .</detailed_description>
