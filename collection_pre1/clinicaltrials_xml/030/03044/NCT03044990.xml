	<brief_summary>Several epidemiologic study report patient renal insufficiency might increase cardiovascular disease-related mortality rate Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . The increase risk population may relate less use standard guideline-based treatment result inability perform PCI effectively . Recently , technology improvement progress clinical trial , Chinese guideline make new recommendation patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) different state renal function . However , scant epidemiologic information exists prognosis patient , especially Henan . And still uncertainty whether patient use late guideline recommend treatment . This multicenter , prospective , observational study aim evaluate long prognosis patient acute coronary syndrome complicate renal insufficiency , analysis related factor influence outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Henan institute cardiology epidemiology responsible design , data quality control statistical analysis . 2 . Data collect use uniformed Case Report Form ( CRF ) train staff hospital . 3 . Sample size estimation : Based retrospective observational cohort ACS patient , 1-year mortality normal renal function renal disfunction 2.8 % 7.9 % , respectively . To achieve precision 15 % α 0.05 , loss ratio following-up 10 % .The investigator would need sample 2000 . 4 . Statistical analysis plan : investigator report summary statistic patient characteristic , renal function status , comorbidities , treatment strategy outcomes . investigator also undertake follow prespecified subgroup analysis : age , sex , STE-ACS NSTE-ACS , history diabetes , history hypertension , smoke Syntax score . 5 . Quality assurance plan 1 ) Diagnosis ACS accord third universal definition.2 ) Before registry , train program study objective , data collection , ACS management give primary investigator related staff participate center.3 ) Henan institute cardiology epidemiology regularly monitor least 10 % CRFs accuracy medical record . If CRFs complete 98 % accuracy , CRFs consider unqualified staff retrained.4 ) Before enter computer , data query invalid illogical value research staff Henan institute cardiology epidemiology . Participating centre high error rate data , change 6 month shall deem abandon automatically ; participate centre high quality data issue certificate reward.5 ) Investigator meet annually hold conclude progress , solve exist problem strengthen program training .</detailed_description>
