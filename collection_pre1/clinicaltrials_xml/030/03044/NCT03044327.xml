	<brief_title>Development Novel Non-invasive Inflammometry Following Lipopolysaccharide , Endotoxin ( LPS ) Challenge Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis project local inflammatory change lung induce LPS capture gas-enhanced Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) analysis exhale breath . While MRI able provide localize information inflammatory process , exhale breath analysis capture integral information time . Assuming novel technique correlate cellular measure inflammation , repetitive measurement investigate onset duration action investigational new drug make possible . The evaluation whether LPS induce change lung capture monitor MRI perform correlation multiple endpoint describe cellular composition airway variable derive MRI breath analysis .</detailed_description>
