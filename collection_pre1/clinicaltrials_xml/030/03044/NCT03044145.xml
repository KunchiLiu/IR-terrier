	<brief_summary>This study consist two project : Project 1 : The study team create refine CFI-EA enrol 3 clinician 9-12 patient test CFI-EA 's feasibility acceptability patient clinician feedback pre-pilot trial . The study team first train clinician CFI-EA read CFI-EA treatment manual practicing use behavioral simulation , check whether participant think ( feasibility ) like ( acceptability ) standard measure . Following study team revise CFI-EA base feedback comparative open trial Phase 2 . Project 2 : The study team test revise CFI-EA treatment usual pilot trial . 3 clinician 12-15 patient enrol arm . As , study team first train clinician revise CFI-EA read CFI-EA treatment manual practicing use behavioral simulation . Then , study team check whether participant think ( feasibility ) like ( acceptability ) standard measure , addition also explore initial effect communication behavior among patient clinician treatment engagement base treatment retention . The specific aim : For Project 1 : 1 . To pretest CFI-EA intervention mental health set pre-pilot open trial explores communication mechanism action term communication behavior cultural content , 2 . To revise CFI-EA intervention base patient clinician feedback feasibility acceptability . As real-world community stakeholder CFI-EA develop , patient clinician provide helpful perspective CFI-EA help clinician tailor treatment plan around patient cultural view treatment preference keep patient care . The CFI-EA revise around area maximal agreement among patient clinician help health disparity communication expert . For Project 2 : 1 . To test revise CFI-EA 's feasibility acceptability among patient clinician pilot open trial treatment usual , 2 . To explore relationship revise CFI-EA 's effect patient-clinician communication treatment engagement . The study team hypothesize clinician use revise CFI-EA show positive communication behavior compare clinician deliver treatment usual CFI-EA patient stay treatment longer . Communication behavior assess communication analysis technique Roter Interaction Analysis System .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Members underserved racial/ethnic minority group participate actively treatment process almost three time odds stay treatment follow appointment compare standard treatment . Improving patient-clinician communication may therefore improve treatment engagement , start participate treatment actively maintain treatment successful resolution symptom improvement quality life . Interventions enhance communication behavior ask patient cultural view , use open-ended question , establish rapport , use patient term increase patient participation satisfaction . Interventions expose clinician cultural content ask patient preference treatment , barrier access service , role support family friend , encourage information exchange also improve treatment engagement . The goal study develop communication intervention improve treatment engagement member underserved racial ethnic minority group improve clinician communication behavior expose patient cultural content . Here , culture understood dynamic process mean make patient clinician . This intervention design patient belong specific racial ethnic group , improve general communication patient clinician . The intervention improve communication make communication behavior cultural content topic explicit conversation rather allow clinician make cultural assumption take grant . We focus racial ethnic minority significant evidence document disparity health communication care . In session 1 , clinician full CFI DSM-5 ( ~15 minute ) complete full standard intake information already obtain CFI ( ~35 minute ) . In session 2 3 , clinician integrate CFI-EA ( ~5 minute ) within regular care standard appointment . At JHMC , Session 2 last 60 minute treatment initiation . Session 3 last 20-30 minute check treatment continuation . Because grant train develop mental health intervention , study team follow NIMH model know Stage Model Intervention Development . The first project create intervention patient clinician feedback JHMC expert consensus K23 mentoring team . The second project test intervention trial compare CFI-EA treatment usual . Patients Project 1 recruited sample convenience among patient access care day research assistant wait area . For project 2 , patient sample consecutively JHMC 's intake coordinator time project start target enrollment reach . The intake coordinator keep record patient agree agree enroll study . Patients agree enrol Project 2 recruit research assistant wait area assign randomly either CFI-EA clinician treatment-as-usual clinician base random number generator . The study team use study measure project examine whether revision CFI-EA conduct end Project 1 show improvement outcomes Project 2 .</detailed_description>
