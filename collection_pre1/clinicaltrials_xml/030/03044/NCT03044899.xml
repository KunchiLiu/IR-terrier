	<brief_summary>STUDY OBJECTIVE To confirm incidence in-hospital postoperative complication adult surgical patient Africa . STUDY DESIGN Seven day , African national multi-centre prospective observational cohort study adult ( ≥18 year ) patient undergo surgery . Patients follow maximum 30 day . We follow original International Surgical Outcomes Study ( ISOS ) study design . The primary outcome in-hospital postoperative complication adult surgical patient Africa . Secondary outcome include in-hospital mortality relationship postoperative complication postoperative mortality . The intention present representative sample surgical outcome across African country . This study run February March 2016 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research question Primary objective To confirm incidence in-hospital postoperative complication adult surgical patient Africa Secondary objectives 1 . To confirm rate mortality day surgery patient undergo surgery Africa . 2 . To confirm in-hospital mortality rate patient undergo surgery Africa . 3 . To describe relationship postoperative complication postoperative mortality . 4 . To describe proportional contribution communicable , non-communicable disease traumatic injury in-hospital mortality critical care admission Africa . Methods Seven day , African national multi-centre cohort study adult ( ≥18 year ) patient undergo surgery . This study register ClinicalTrials.gov . Inclusion criteria All consecutive patient admit participate centre undergo elective non-elective surgery commence seven day study cohort period plan overnight hospital stay follow surgery . The recruitment week run February March 2016 . Exclusion criteria Patients undergoing plan day-case surgery radiological procedure require anaesthesia . Centres Our plan recruit many centre possible international basis ask include eligible patient study . Number centre . We plan recruit many centre country participation . Countries expect contribute data least 10 centre . Where country less 10 centre perform surgery nationally , least 50 % surgical centre need contribute data ASOS . Number patient Only centre provide patient data least 90 % eligible surgical case recruitment week include data analysis . The select recruitment week country decide National Leader . Ethics approval The requirement patient consent expect vary accord regulation participate nation . The national leader ensure ethic approval obtain respective country centre . Centres permit record data unless ethic approval equivalent waiver place . This study effect large scale clinical audit . We expect , every country , requirement individual patient consent data anonymised already record part routine clinical care . This international precedent already set , original European Surgical Outcomes Study ( EuSOS ) , consent waive 27 28 European country participate , seven eight ethic committee South African Surgical Outcomes Study ( SASOS ) . Data collection collation Data collect individual centre paper case record form ( CRFs ) every patient recruit . Paper CRFs store within lock office centre include identifiable patient data order allow follow-up clinical outcome . Data pseudo-anonymised generation unique numeric code transcribe local investigator onto internet base electronic CRF . Each patient identify electronic CRF numeric code ; thus co-ordinating study team trace data back individual patient without contact local team . A participant ( patient ) list use centre match identifier code database individual patient order record clinical outcome supply miss data point . Access data entry system protect username password deliver registration process individual local investigator . All electronic data transfer participate centre co-ordinating centre encrypt use secure protocol . Where individual centre unable access internet base case record form , pseudo-anonymised ( cod ) facsimile ( fax ) data transfer available secure , dedicate fax machine co-ordinating office . Pseudo-anonymised ( cod ) data may also send mail coordinate centre necessary . Each centre complete screen log report number eligible surgical patient surgery recruitment week centre . Each centre maintain secure trial file include protocol , local investigator delegation log , ethic approval documentation patient list . Once local co-ordinator confirms data entry complete hospital receive spreadsheet raw ( un-cleaned ) data , allow check data completeness accuracy . Dataset A realistic data set fundamental success investigation , confirm EuSOS study nearly complete data available 46 000 patient , similarly SASOS study . We therefore adopt core data variable EuSOS , International Surgical Outcomes Study ( ISOS ) SASOS study order achieve study objective . We believe key data point encourage centre participate excessive burden data collection . Centre co-ordinators may request addition limited number data point support additional country specific data collection subsequent regional analysis . All additional data point must discuss co-principal investigator necessary steer committee . Centre specific data collect hospital include : university non-university hospital , number hospital bed , number operating room , number level critical care bed detail reimbursement status hospital . An ASOS case record form ( CRF ) complete every eligible patient undergoes surgery seven day cohort period ( appendix 1 ) . Patients follow hospital discharge . This censored thirty day i.e . patient follow discharge thirty day whichever short period . Sample size calculation Our plan recruit many centre possible participate country ask include eligible patient study . A minimum ten centre country require participation ( exception country less 10 centre perform surgery nationally , circumstance least 50 % surgical centre need contribute data ASOS ) . Only centre include data least 90 % eligible patient include data analysis . We specific sample size statistical model adapt event rate provide sample recruit . Statistical analysis Data present national level follow geographical region : Northern , Western , Central , Eastern Southern Africa . All institutional level data anonymised prior publication . Categorical variable describe proportion compare use chi-square test . Continuous variable describe mean standard deviation normally distributed median inter-quartile range normally distribute . Comparisons continuous variable group perform use t-tests , one-way ANOVA equivalent non parametric test appropriate . Univariate analysis perform test factor associate postoperative complication , critical care admission in-hospital death . Single-level hierarchical multi-level logistic regression model construct identify factor independently associate outcomes adjust difference confound factor . Factors enter model base univariate relation outcome ( p &lt; 0.05 ) , biological plausibility low rate miss data . Results logistic regression report adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) 95 % confidence interval . The model assess use sensitivity analysis explore possible interact factor examine effect result . A single final analysis plan end study . Primary outcome measure Incidence in-hospital postoperative complication adult surgical patient Africa . Secondary outcome measure 1 . Rate mortality day surgery patient undergo surgery Africa . 2 . The in-hospital mortality rate patient undergo surgery Africa . Organisation The Steering Committee chair Bruce Biccard ( BB ) Thandinkosi Madiba ( TM ) . The study management team appoint Steering Committee lead BB TM . The duty team include administration project task , communication project partner ( include funders , steer committee member , national local co-ordinators , etc . ) , data collation management preparation report individual study site . The Steering Committee responsible scientific conduct consistency project . The Steering Committee ensure communication funder ( ) , study management team co-ordinators necessary . Country co-ordinators Country co-ordinators appoint steer committee lead project within individual country : - Identify local co-ordinators participate hospital - Assist translation study paperwork require - Ensure distribution research manual , CRF material - Ensure necessary regulatory approval place prior start date - Ensure good communication participate site his/her country Local co-ordinators Local co-ordinators individual institution follow responsibility : - Provide leadership study institution - Ensure relevant regulatory approval place institution - Ensure adequate training relevant staff prior data collection - Supervise daily data collection assist problem solve - Act guarantor integrity quality data collect - Ensure timely completion CRFs - Communicate relevant national coordinator</detailed_description>
