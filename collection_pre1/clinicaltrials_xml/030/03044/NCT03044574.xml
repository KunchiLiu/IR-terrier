	<brief_title>Intermittent Pneumatic Compression Surgical Patients Extremely-high Risk Venous Thromboembolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) common complication major surgery , especially high-risk patient . But high-risk group inhomogeneous . Some patient include group extremely high prevalence postoperative venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism , standard complex prophylaxis elastic compression standard anticoagulation less effective . This particularly , patient Caprini score 11 , background standard prophylaxis postoperative DVT 10 time higher . This group patient need effective protocol VTE prevention . Sequential compression device ( SCD ) combine graduate elastic compression stocking ( GCS ) without find effective prevention VTE high-risk patient , especially neurosurgical intervention , even without administration anticoagulant . However , efficacy patient `` extremely high risk '' , 11+ Caprini score assess yet . The aim current study evaluate efficacy safety VTE prophylaxis combination graduate compression stocking ( GCS ) , standard dose low-molecular-weight heparin ( LMWH ) sequential compression device ( SCD ) mix group surgical patient high extremely high risk venous thromboembolism The expect outcome study reduction asymptomatic postoperative venous thrombosis rate hospital reduction VTE 6 month discharge .</detailed_description>
