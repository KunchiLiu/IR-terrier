Since 2009 , DICER 1 mutation research propose systematically family . PPB symptom usually non-specific . Diagnostic evoke imaging work show bubble solid lesion , confirm pathological analysis . However diagnosis difficult proximity congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation . The French society paediatric oncology recommend surgery first instance . PPB type 1 remains problem still misdiagnosed CCAM , benign lesion . Chemotherapy depend PPB type quality resection . There real interest analyse French series . The prognosis type 2 3 low 5 year survival rate 45-60 % , whereas type 1 survival rate 91 % . The French experience report 100 % survival rate type 1 48 % type 2 3 . Other prognostic factor initial size tumour , extra pulmonary invasion quality surgery . Early local relapse possible late one concern often type 2 3 cerebral metastasis . In 2009 , french case collect , update perform since . The aim retrospective review case since 2000 , audit care PPB patient France update French rare tumour database . Evoking PPB diagnosis difficult imaging show neonatal cystic lesion . There radiologic criterion literature differentiate congenital pulmonary cystic lesion PPB type 1 . Radiological presentation however overlap . Another aim study look predictive sign type 1 PPB .</brief_summary>
