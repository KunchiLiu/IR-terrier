	<brief_summary>This study design identify best tolerated dos [ 131 ] Iodine-MIBG [ 90 ] Yttrium-DOTATOC co-administered treat midgut neuroendocrine tumor . These drug ( 131I-MIBG , 90Y-DOTATOC ) radioactive drug , know radionuclide therapy . Currently , safe best tolerate dos drug ( combine together ) unknown .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Safety Combining Two Radionuclide Therapies Treat Mid-gut Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>[ 131 ] Iodine-MIBG [ 90 ] Yttrium-DOTATOC radioactive drug design treat specific tumor cell . These drug combination radiation ( 131-Iodine , 90-Yttrium ) protein target tumor cell ( MIBG DOTATOC ) . Because protein attract , stick , tumor , radiation center tumor . This kill tumor cell minimize radiation-damage healthy tissue , like heart lung . Two organ still absorb radiation , though : bone marrow kidney . These organ limit much radiation give tumor , n't know much radiation much . Too much radiation bone marrow result anemia . Too much radiation kidney result kidney failure . From prior radiation therapy , general idea much radiation give safely . 131I-MIBG 90Y-DOTATOC never give together . We want give together many time , tumor actually group different type cell . This mean , cell respond therapy way . If tumor cell survive therapy , tumor continue grow eventually come back . We know mid-gut neuroendocrine tumor ( NETs ) target DOTATOC mid-gut NETs target MIBG . We also identify people mid-gut NETs different tumor : target MIBG target DOTATOC . For people , mean treat 131I-MIBG 90Y-DOTATOC enough treat cancer . They need radioactive drug . Because combine radioactive drug , study know first-in-man study . We also use special imaging help u estimate radiation dose bone marrow kidney . This decide final dose 131I-MIBG 90Y-DOTATOC . Before receive therapy , participant ask undergo image verify MIBG DOTATOC tumor type : - participant give small dos radioactive drug - special camera ( SPECT/CT ) collect image ( scan ) - imaging ( scan ) do 3 calendar day - blood sample take time , , measure circulate amount tracer dose If scan show participant MIBG DOTATOC tumor , therapy give : - customize dose 90Y-DOTATOC give day 1 treatment cycle . This give outpatient . - customize dose 131I-MIBG give day 2 treatment cycle . This give inpatient ( admitted hospital ) . - participant monitor blood test identify side effect therapy . Each participant 2 cycle therapy . The cycle 12 week apart . The dos 90Y-DOTATOC 131I-MIBG decide base radiation bone marrow radiation kidney . Doses decide well participant do study . Participants life long follow-up study . This important , study like do .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A 2step eligibility utilize study . STEP 1 : A pathologically confirm ( histology cytology ) malignant neoplasm determine welldifferentiated neuroendocrine tumor ( i.e . grade 1 grade 2 ) . The primary tumor location know believe midgut . Disease amenable curative intent treatment ( primarily surgery ) addition show either clinical radiographic progression available therapy know confer clinical benefit . Nuclear medicine scan utilize 111InDTPAPhe3Octreotide ( Octreoscan™ ) 68GaDOTAtyr3Octreotide within 12 month prior anticipate C1D1 demonstrate SSTR positive tumor site : ≥1 tumor site must demonstrate uptake equal great normal liver document nuclear scan image ≥1 evaluable site disease measure ≥ 1.5 cm diameter CT MRI measure per RECIST ≥ 18 70 year time study drug administration . Karnofsky Performance Status least 70 % Agrees contraception . Ability understand willingness provide inform consent . Exclusion criterion : Women pregnant breast feeding . Surgery , radiation chemotherapy within 4 week propose step 1 start date . Investigational drug within 4 week propose step 1 start date . More one concurrent , malignant disease . History congestive heart failure cardiac ejection fraction ≤ 40 % . Patients , opinion physician , 24hour discontinuation somatostatin analogue therapy represent health risk . Patients unable discontinue medication know affect MIBG uptake Proteinuria , grade 2 ( i.e. , ≥ 2+proteinuria ) . Longacting somatostatin analogue treatment within 14 day propose step 1 start date . Prior external beam radiation involve kidney ( scatter dose &lt; 500 cGy single kidney radiation &lt; 50 % single kidney acceptable ) . Prior external beam radiation ( include brachytherapy ) involve 25 % bone marrow ( exclude scatter dos ≤ 5 Gy ) . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition 90YDOTAtyr3Octreotide , Octreoscan® , 68GaOctreotide , 131IMIBG . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . If subject meet STEP 1 criterion , serial SPECT scan perform dosimetry . Step 2 criterion must meet verified prior therapy initiation . Subjects must demonstrate least one following : One MIBG+ DOTATOC tumor addition one DOTATOC+ tumor One tumor sit calculate `` safe '' radiation tumor dose high least 25 % combination 131IMIBG 90YDOTATOC 90Y DOTATOC alone . Within 2 week study drug administration therapeutic intent , patient must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥ 2000 cells/mm3 platelet ≥100,000 cells/mm3 total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN age weight AST ( SGOT ) ≤ 2.5 x institutional ULN ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x institutional ULN eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2</criteria>
