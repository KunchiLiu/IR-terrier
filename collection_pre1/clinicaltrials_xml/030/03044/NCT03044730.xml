	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether combination two different drug - pembrolizumab capecitabine - safe , might effective treat triple negative hormone-refractory breast cancer . Pembrolizumab type drug contain antibody . Antibodies part immune system find thing n't belong body , bacteria virus . The antibody pembrolizumab find block protein , allow immune system target destroy cancer cell . Pembrolizumab Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve types cancer . It approve breast cancer , mean `` experimental '' `` investigational '' treatment . Capecitabine type chemotherapy pill standard treatment FDA-approved breast cancer . It stop cancer cell able multiply .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Capecitabine Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Triple Negative Hormone-Refractory Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate median progression-free survival ( median PFS ) participant receive pembrolizumab capecitabine treatment locally advance metastatic triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) hormone-refractory metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe objective response rate ( ORR ) participant receive pembrolizumab capecitabine treatment locally advance metastatic TNBC hormone-refractory MBC . II . To describe safety tolerability combination pembrolizumab capecitabine treatment locally advance metastatic TNBC hormone-refractory MBC . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Analysis expression program cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) immunohistochemical ( IHC ) analysis . II . To assess circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) . III . To evaluate ORR median-PFS use immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( irRECIST ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
