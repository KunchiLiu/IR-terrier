	<brief_title>Therapeutic Efficacy Safety Mirabegron Treatment Patients With Overactive Bladder Syndrome Taiwan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder syndrome ( OAB ) define symptom syndrome frequency , urgency without urgency incontinence . OAB affect 400 million people worldwide estimate affect around 16 % adult population across Europe USA . In Asian country , prevalence OAB report 6 % men woman age ≥18 year China ; 12.2 % men woman Korea ; 12.4 % men woman age ≥40 year Japan ; 21 25 % woman 16.9 % community dwell adult Taiwan . Another study report prevalence OAB among adult men across 11 Asian country ( India , Indonesia , Malaysia , Pakistan , Philippines , Singapore , South Korea , Taiwan , China , Hong Kong Thailand ) 29.9 % . Antimuscarinics first line pharmacotherapy OAB . However , patient suboptimal response antimuscarinics may experience adverse effect , dry mouth constipation . Therefore , high proportion patient discontinue antimuscarinic therapy , few 25 % remain treatment 1 year . There unmet need develop new drug OAB without bothersome adverse effect antimuscarinic agent . β3-adrenergic receptor know promote urine storage bladder induce detrusor relaxation animal human bladder . In human , β3-adrenoceptor predominant β-receptor subtype urinary bladder . β3-adrenoceptor agonist relax detrusor smooth muscle bladder storage phase increase bladder capacity without accompany change micturition pressure , residual volume void contraction . Mirabegron first β3-adrenoceptor agonist approve treatment OAB . Pooled safety data indicate dry mouth , chief cause treatment discontinuation antimuscarinic agent , occurs low incidence mirabegronc . Hence , mirabegron may valuable treatment option patient OAB . Recent phase III trial confirm efficacy safety mirabegron treatment OAB Europeans , Australians , North Americans , Japanese Asians . Whether mirabegron 25mg 50mg use first line treatment OAB determine yet . The dose effectiveness relationship 25mg 50mg mirabegron also investigate yet . Hence , investigator conduct post-marketing study order evaluate efficacy safety mirabegron 25mg 50mg Taiwanese people symptom OAB . Materials Methods Study Title : Therapeutic Efficacy Safety Mirabegron , β3-Adrenoceptor Agonist , Patients Overactive Bladder Syndrome Taiwan Primary objective : evaluate efficacy Mirabegron 50 mg v 25 mg Taiwanese patient Secondary objective : ass safety tolerability Mirabegron 50 mg v 25 mg Taiwanese patient Other objective : investigate potential predictive factor treatment outcome use baseline demographic ( ex . Comorbidity , age , etc . ) urodynamic study finding . Randomization accomplish use computer-generated randomization scheme ( Cenduit GmbH , Allshwil , Switzerland ) stratification site ; allocation treatment group site accomplish via interactive response system study coordinator . Study visit take place Week 0 ( Visit 1 ; confirmation eligibility criterion ) ; Weeks 4 , 8 12 ( Visits 2 , 3 4 ) . The study approve institutional review board study site conduct accordance ethical principle origin Declaration Helsinki , Good Clinical Practice , International Conference Harmonisation guideline , applicable law regulation . Efficacy End-points : Primary endpoint ( ) : The percentage patient change baseline final visit urgency episodes per 24 hour 2 great . Secondary endpoint ( ) : 1 . Secondary efficacy end-points change baseline final visit OABSS score , Patient Perception Intensity Urgency Scale ( PPIUS ) , mean number frequency episode , urinary incontinence episode , urgency incontinence episode nocturia episode per 24 hour , mean volume void per micturition . Change baseline study visit efficacy variable also measure . An additional secondary end-point change baseline final visit Patient Perception ladder Condition ( PPBC ) ass patient ' subjective satisfaction treatment drug bladder condition . Paper diary use trial . 2 . Adverse event ( AEs ) assess visit . Safety endpoint incidence severity AEs , change baseline end-of-treatment vital sign ( heart rate , systolic diastolic blood pressure ) laboratory test ( hematology , biochemistry urinalysis ) . 3 . To determine predictive factor treatment outcome use baseline demographic ( ex . comorbidity , age , etc . ) urodynamic study finding . PPIUS ( Patient Perception Intensity Urgency Scale ) : 0 . No urgency , I felt need empty bladder , reason . 1 . Mild urgency , I could postpone void long necessary , without fear wetting . 2 . Moderate urgency , I could postpone void short , without fear wetting . 3 . Severe urgency , I could postpone void , rush toilet order wet . 4 . Urge incontinence , I leak reach toilet . Patient Perception ladder Condition ( PPBC ) : Which follow statement describes bladder condition best moment ? 0 : My bladder condition cause problem . 1 . My bladder condition cause minor problem . 2 . My bladder condition cause minor problem . 3 . My bladder condition cause ( ) moderate problem . 4 . My bladder condition cause severe problem . 5 . My bladder condition cause many severe problem . Safety Assessment : Safety assessment include report adverse event ( AEs , unfavorable sign symptom observe start run-in period end follow-up period ) . Exacerbation symptom OAB define AE clinical study . Sample size : 574 patient within two year Justification : The sample size study base result 12-week Phase III study ( 178-CL-074 ) . In 074 study , responder analysis reduction urgency episodes minimum important difference 1.54 episode 47.1 % M25 group 57.7 % M50 group . In ISR , primary efficacy end-point percentage patient change baseline final visit urgency episodes per 24 hour 2 great . The respond rate assume 60 % M50 group 45 % M25 group . The number patient per group necessary demonstrate superiority first group ( mirabegron 25mg 12 week ) would 244 two-sided significance level 5 % power 90 % . Assuming dropout rate 15 % treatment period , 287 subject per group enrol randomization . Expected Results : The result study demonstrate : 1 . Mirabegron 25mg once-daily 12 week effective safe treatment patient OAB ( group 1 ) . 2 . Mirabegron 50mg effective improve OAB symptom therapeutic efficacy dose 25mg mirabegron 4 week suboptimal ( group 2 ) 3 . Investigators try search predictive factor responder mirabegron 25mg alone , escalate mirabegron 50mg , base baseline demographic urodynamic study finding ,</detailed_description>
