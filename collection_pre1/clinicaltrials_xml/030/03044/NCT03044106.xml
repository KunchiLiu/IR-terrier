	<detailed_description>First Visit . The research staff schedule study visit Neurophysiology Lab appropriate site UNC Healthcare system medical school . The baseline phase first visit include review inclusion/exclusion criterion component study . Those wish sign consent complete brief questionnaire activity level , history hamstring injury , perceive hamstring tightness . Randomization/Random Allocation . Subjects meet inclusion criterion give consent randomize one follow first treatment period : 1 ) active CLRT ; 2 ) sham laser . At first intervention visit , research assistant enter subject 's assigned ID online computer program ( select study biostatistician ) determine assignment one two period . The study biostatistician use computer-generated random number generate allocation sequence use random block random size . The program document treatment assignment un-editable form include date stamp . Post Randomization . After randomization , subject ask complete three functional hamstring test : KEA , HHD , PPT . Subjects direct contact investigator research assistant visit facilitate adverse event reporting . Assessments . KEA : The 90-90 Knee Extension Angle test functional assessment design ass low extremity flexibility consider gold standard hamstring length . The participant supine position treatment table . The tested extremity ( right leg subject ) place 90° hip 90° knee position contralateral low extremity place flat table . A digital inclinometer consistently place level medial malleoli superior pole patella . The examiner maintain 90° hip flexion . Pelvic position monitor palpation anterior superior iliac spine lumbar spinous process maintain neutral pelvic position . The examiner passively extend knee point `` strong , tolerable stretch , '' report subject . The examiner read angle inclinometer record mean value three attempt . A great angle indicate great degree flexibility . Hand hold Dynamometry ( HHD ) currently consider reliable valid measurement peak muscle contraction . The subject prone table right leg bent 90° . The tester place dynamometer ( microFET2 ; Hoggan Health Industries , Salt Lake City , UT ) heel participant apply force heel , gradually increase 3 5 second . Participants instructed resist apply force maximally contract hamstring muscle HHD device . The test end longer able resist force leg begin move ( break point ) . The investigator record mean value three attempt . Pain Pressure Threshold ( PPT ) reliable , accurate valid method measure muscle pain sensitivity response treatment . The digital algometer ( FDX , Wagner Instruments , Greenwich , CT ) hand-held muscle tester range 0-100 lbf consist pad disc diameter 0.5 '' attach microprocessor-control unit measure peak force ( pound kilogram ) . The unit digital readout peak-applied pressure provide built-in calibration routine verifies valid calibration . In order determine PPT , researcher apply tip algometer tender spot participant 's hamstring increase amount pressure participant verbally inform researcher sensation pressure become pain . At point algometer remove peak force record . The mean three repeat measure report . Intervention : Cranial Laser Reflex Technique ( CLRT ) novel complementary alternative ( CAM ) medicine intervention musculoskeletal condition incorporate principle laser acupuncture chiropractic cranial reflexology ( 26 ) . Developed 2006 Dr. Nick Wise ( PI ) , CLRT incorporate clinical practice hundred practitioner around world . It involve non-invasive laser stimulation distinct cranial microsystem discover chiropractor . It postulate cranial reflex similar nature acupuncture point would likewise respond photobiomodulation ( PBM ) low level laser . Clinical experience PI others confirm cranial reflex indeed responsive low dos ( 0.5-5 J/cm2 ) laser light : length , strength , pain specific muscle could improve rapidly , even case chronic post-stroke muscle spasm . Procedure : Subject protective eyewear remain prone position . The hamstring reflex two line posterior portion top head , approximately 2 cm long 2 cm apart , run parallel sagittal suture ( fig . 1 ) . The posterior end reflex locate find vertex , CZ point standardize 10-20 EEG system , move laterally approximately 1 cm . Sequence : In order determine optimal direction stimulation , investigator first perform brief manual muscle test hamstring . The subject bend knee 90 degree . The investigator quickly drag finger along cranial reflex extremity test moderate pressure , swipe first anterior posterior ( a-b ) . The subject ask contract hamstring resist investigator 's attempt straighten leg 2 second . Then investigator swipe quickly opposite direction ( b-a ) repeat muscle test . The direction provide strong response determine investigator use laser stimulation subject . If a-b direction chosen , aperture laser probe place point ( ) , turn move point ( b ) speed approximately 2 cm/s . The laser turn quickly return point ( ) , turn move point ( b ) . This repeat total 30 time . If manual muscle test response equivocal , laser leave powered probe move total 15 pass direction . The probe make light contact scalp power laser pas , move aside much hair possible . Device : The treatment device use study Class IIIB 810nm 200mW near-infrared GAAlAS diode laser ( THOR Photomedicine Ltd , Great Britain ) currently market US . The laser probe FDA-cleared classify non-significant risk device . The spot size 0.0364 cm2 , treatment time 30 second . Current best-practice recommendation laser acupuncture ( 35 ) recommend dosage 1-4 J/cm2 per point . Since CRP line 2 cm , purpose calculate dosage , treat series 10 connected point diameter 2mm . With scan rate 2cm/s , `` point '' line receive 1/10 pas , total 3 ( 30 total ) exposure time per point . The dose per point intervention calculate approximately 1.65 J/cm2 . There one-week washout subject return second treatment period . Primary Outcome : 90-90 Knee Extension Angle Test . KEA functional test design ass low extremity flexibility consider gold standard test assess hamstring length ( 53 ) . Results record degree knee flexion angle . A clinically significant effect size increase 5 degree . Secondary Outcomes Handheld Dynamometry . HHD currently consider reliable valid measurement peak muscle contraction . The subject prone table right leg bend 90° maximally contract hamstring muscle 4-5 second HHD device . The investigator record mean value three attempt . Pain Pressure Threshold . PPT reliable , accurate valid method measure muscle pain sensitivity response treatment ( 54 ) . In order determine PPT , researcher apply tip algometer tender spot participant 's hamstring increase amount pressure participant verbally inform researcher sensation pressure become pain . At point algometer remove peak force record . The mean three repeat measure report . An increase PPT signify increase pain tolerance . Additional Variables Age , gender , activity level , perceive hamstring tightness , perceive hamstring flexibility perceive hamstring strength assess baseline subsequent follow visit . Sample Size Power : Based previously publish result ( 55 ) , would consider mean increase 5º KEA ( e.g. , 135º 140º ) clinically meaningful , assume common standard deviation 15º . We assume correlation repeat measurement individual least 0.75 ( likely conservative assumption ) . Under assumption , enrol 38 participant would provide least 80 % power use two-sided test 0.05 level .</detailed_description>
