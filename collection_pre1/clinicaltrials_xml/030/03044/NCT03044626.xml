Subject willing able comply protocol duration study include undergoing treatment schedule visit examination include follow . 3 . Age &gt; 18 year time study entry . 4 . ECOG performance status 01 . 5 . Expected life expectancy ≥ 6 month . 6 . Patients measurable disease ( least one unidimensionally measurable target lesion CTscan MRI ) accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST 1.1 ) eligible . For patient Group A , nonmeasurable measurable lesion may choose irradiation . However , order allow evaluation abscopal effect , patient Group A must least one measurable lesion beside lesion plan irradiate . Lesions plan irradiated may define measurable target lesion . Radiographic tumor assessment must perform within 28 day initiation study treatment . 7 . Target Lesions may locate previously irradiate field document ( radiographic ) disease progression site . 8 . Patients metastatic nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer 2ndline 3rdline treatment : 1. necessity radiotherapy 2. necessity radiotherapy metastatic bone lesion soft tissue lesion . Patients intrathoracic metastasis intrathoracic progressive disease include radiotherapy lung parenchyma NOT required Subjects symptomatic brain metastasis eligible metastasis treat magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evidence progression 12 week treatment complete within 28 day prior first dose nivolumab administration . There must also requirement immunosuppressive dos systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 2 week prior study drug administration . Moreover , patient stable ( asymptomatic ) brain metastasis require local therapy WBI ( whole brain irradiation ) include . 9 . Patients receive study therapy acceptable prior therapy specify eligible : ) Patients receive study therapy 2ndline 3rdline treatment : • Patients must experience disease recurrence progression one prior platinum doubletbased chemotherapy regimen advance metastatic disease . First line therapy define therapy use treat advanced disease . Each subsequent line therapy precede disease progression . A switch agent within regimen order manage toxicity define start new line therapy . Subjects must receive least 2 cycle platinum doublet base chemotherapy discontinuation toxicity . Experimental therapy give separate regimen consider separate line therapy . Maintenance therapy follow platinum doubletbased chemotherapy consider separate regimen therapy could comprise continuation one agent use firstline therapy regimen switch another non crossresistant agent . The initiation maintenance therapy require lack progressive disease frontline therapy . Treatment give locally advanced disease consider line therapy advance disease . Subjects recurrent disease &gt; 6 month platinumcontaining adjuvant , neoadjuvant definitive chemoradiation therapy give locally advanced disease , also subsequently progress platinum doubletbased regimen give treat recurrence , eligible . • Patients receive platinumcontaining adjuvant , neoadjuvant definitive chemoradiation therapy give locally advanced disease , develop recurrent ( local metastatic ) disease within 6 month complete therapy eligible . Adjuvant neoadjuvant platinumdoublet chemotherapy ( surgery and/or radiation therapy ) follow recurrent metastatic disease within 6 month complete therapy consider first line therapy advance disease . 10 .

Men receive nivolumab sexually active WOCBP instruct adhere contraception period 31 week last dose investigational product . Women childbearing potential ( ie , postmenopausal surgically sterile well azoospermic men require contraception ) . 1 . Previous malignancy ( NSCLC ) , either progress require active treatment . Subjects previous malignancy ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer , follow situ cancer : bladder , gastric , colon , cervical/dysplasia , endometrial , melanoma , breast ) exclude unless complete remission achieve least 2 year prior study entry AND additional therapy require anticipate required study period . 2 . Brain metastasis mandate active treatment term WBI ( whole brain irradiation ) . Subjects brain metastasis eligible metastasis treat magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evidence progression 12 week treatment complete within 28 day prior first dose nivolumab administration . There must also requirement immunosuppressive dos systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 2 week prior study drug administration . 3 . Known activate EGFR mutation know ALK translocation . 4 . Prior therapy antitumor vaccine immunostimulatory antitumor agent . 5 . Patients symptomatic interstitial lung disease . 6 . Any previous treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCTLA4 antibody , antibody drug specifically target T‑cell costimulation immune checkpoint pathways 7 . All toxicity attribute prior anticancer therapy alopecia fatigue must resolve grade 1 ( NCI CTCAE version 4 ) baseline administration study drug . 8 . Patients exclude active , know suspected autoimmune disease . NOTE : Subjects permit enroll vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger 9 . Patients exclude condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration .
