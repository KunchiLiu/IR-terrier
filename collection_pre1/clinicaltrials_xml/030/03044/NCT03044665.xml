	<brief_summary>The clinical efficacy LDL-lowering therapy proven strong evidence emphasize . However , also grow concern high-intensity statin would relate increased risk adverse effect . In addition , inconsistency efficacy statin accord ethnic population . Asian population show profound LDL reduction high potent statin moderate low potent statin . Conventional strategy lower LDL-cholesterol focus statin , therefore double previously describe dose statin would common way patient inadequate lower LDL-cholesterol level . Additive ezetimibe also alternative strategy lower LDL-cholesterol level also reduce need dosage high-intensity statin fulfill sufficient LDL-cholesterol lowering effect . We evaluate whether additive ezetimibe rosuvastatin comparable clinical efficacy term clinical outcome goal attainment LDL-C compare rosuvastatin monotherapy .</brief_summary>
