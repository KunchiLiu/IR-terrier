	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop measurement system assess adjustment mechanical circulatory support ( MCS ) ( also refer ventricular assist device [ VAD ] ) health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) patient advanced heart failure receive VAD . This investigator refer measurement system Mechanical Circulatory Support : Adjustment Quality Life ( MCS A-QOL ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanical Support Measures Adjustment QOL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate 5.1 million U.S. adult heart failure , incidence 825,000 new case annually . The prevalence heart failure expect increase 46 % 2012 2030 . Mechanical circulatory support ( MCS ) develop bridge heart transplantation permanent support ( i.e. , destination therapy ) . MCS device help heart pump blood body . Left ventricular assist device ( LVADs ) , type MCS , support leave heart . Health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) important outcome advance heart failure patient care make health care decision , include consider surgical treatment option , heart transplantation mechanical circulatory support . Currently available HRQOL questionnaires assess unique burden MCS , change power source driveline exit site dressing ; safety precaution ( e.g. , immersion water , need MCS-trained caregiver ) ; troubleshoot VAD alarm ; MCS-specific complication , often associate frequent hospitalization . Since questionnaire focus issue concern MCS patient , lack sensitivity precision measure potentially wide-ranging impact MCS HRQOL . Guided investigator empirically support MCS A-QOL conceptual model , investigator use state-of-the-science psychometric measurement method create `` item bank '' ( set item comprise carefully calibrate question define quantify common theme ) investigator exist MCS A-QOL item pool ( library relevant item ) . Using calibrated item bank , investigator develop computer adaptive test ( CATs ) fixed-length short form reduce respondent burden enhance measurement precision . The investigator assess reliability , validity , responsiveness change , clinically important difference MCS A-QOL measure . The investigator explore way enhance patient care use MCS A-QOL clinically . The investigator develop test mobile CAT app use patient health care provider . A printed computer-generated summary interpretation measure share patient health care provider clinic visit . They also participate semi-structured interview ass user experience ( i.e. , understandability , usability , acceptability ) mobile app print report .</detailed_description>
