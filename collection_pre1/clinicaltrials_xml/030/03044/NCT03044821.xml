	<brief_summary>Spina bifida neurological abnormality characterize open skin exposure spinal cord back baby time birth . The complete closure separation spinal cord skin occur first month pregnancy . This form spina bifida associate leg weakness , sensation loss , bowel bladder incontinence . The majority patient ( &gt; 80 % ) also develop increased fluid brain , call hydrocephalus , require additional surgery treat problem . Standard treatment myelomeningocele ( MMC ) involve close open back within first 3 day life . The surgery release spinal cord skin bring skin edge together prevent infection injury expose nerve . Of note , type surgery improve function . The investigator want study open in-utero fetal surgery technique patient candidate standard open fetal repair technique pre-pregnancy BMI 35.0-40.0 . The latter reason exclusion open fetal repair center United States .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Myelomeningocele Repair With High Maternal BMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research conduct follow location ( ) : Baylor College Medicine Texas Children 's Hospital- Women 's Pavilion . About 15 subject enrol study . In order eligible study , participant must meet established criterion open fetal MMC surgery also BMI 35.0-40.0 . PREOPERATIVE AND INTRAOPERATIVE CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS : The participant receive two dose 12 mg betamethasone , 24 hour apart , fetal lung maturation gestational age great 23 week . The participant also receive prophylactic tocolysis ( medication prevent preterm contraction ) indomethacin 50 mg prior surgery , 25-50 mg every six eight hour 24-48 hour follow surgery , longer clinically indicate . Magnesium sulfate may also use intraoperatively - 6 gram IV load dose follow 2 gram/hour continuous infusion 24 - 72 hour . In addition , medically indicate , nifedipine ( 10mg orally ) terbutaline ( 0.25mg subcuticularly ) may substitute indomethacin magnesium sulfate base condition medical judgment . Prophylactic antibiotic also administer participant prior procedure use cefazolin , azithromycin , and/or metronidazole , medical history contraindicates use cefazolin , clindamycin , azithromycin , gentamicin administer . A solution nafcillin lactate ringer inject amniotic cavity conclusion procedure . Additional medication , include therapeutic antibiotic , may use part standard care medical team . MATERNAL-FETAL ANESTHESIA : The participant lumbar epidural catheter place prior surgery postoperative analgesia . The procedure perform general anesthesia follow rapid sequence intubation propofol succinylcholine . Anesthesia maintain 2-3 time MAC ( Minimal anesthetic concentration ) volatile anesthetic agent . This high concentration anesthetic agent provide adequate uterine relaxation surgery . After defect repair closure skin incision begin , local anesthetic administer epidural catheter participant start continuous epidural infusion local anesthetic opioid combination . The participant receive medication via epidural pump approximately 3-4 day follow surgery . The epidural pump capability patient self-administering intermittent boluses medication top continuous infusion rate participant become uncomfortable post-operative period . The fetus receive intramuscular injection opioid ( fentanyl 5-10 mcg/kg ) , anticholinergic ( atropine 20 mcg/kg ) , muscle relaxant ( vecuronium 0.3 mg/kg ) buttock extremity use 22G needle pass port order provide muscle relaxation , sedation , analgesia . The drug dosage adjust estimate fetal weight . The fetus receive injection prior start CO2 gas insufflation uterus continue receive combo injection approximately every 45 - 60 minute throughout remainder procedure deem necessary medical team . Subsequent combo injection administer pass 22G needle one uterine port . General maternal anesthesia anesthetic gas know provide fetal anesthesia . The combination injection provide muscle relaxation additional analgesia fetus . This combination medication routinely administer fetus open fetal surgery find adequately sedate fetus fetal intervention procedure . SURGICAL REPAIR : The investigator either make low transverse incision ( also call 'bikini cut ' ) midline vertical incision gain access uterus . The incision size ( 8-10 inch ) need typical cesarean section procedure . Once uterus expose ultrasound perform determine position fetus surgery cardiac function monitor . If necessary , fetus gently reposition outside uterus fetal back face upwards . Ultrasound use help surgical team determine position fetus time . The fetus receive anesthesia injection buttock thigh prior start repair . The anesthesia injection combination medication block pain help relax muscle . In addition , maternal anesthesia also know provide anesthesia fetus . When defect clearly identify , spinal cord release attachment skin . The skin edge sew together use absorbable suture repair technique similar standard technique woman BMI &lt; 35.0 . Sometimes might good use one type style suture ( surgical thread ) surgery . While generally one patient next , may participate mother 's fetus 's best interest change suture suture technique adapt surgery perform . All pre- post-operative care follow-up visit open procedure consider standard care ; therefore , participant responsible cost relate research study normal co-pays deductible . Following participant 's discharge hospital , participant need stay within 30-minute drive Texas Children 's Hospital Pavilion Women allow medical care operation . The participant responsible accommodation cost Houston . POSTOPERATIVE FOLLOW-UP : The investigator collect clinical information participant 's medical chart standard clinical care . In addition , investigator collect clinical information participate child he/she turn 5 year old . The following information collect clinical record participate mom child : 1 . Demographics ( age , parity , height , weight , BMI , use drug alcohol , smoking , clinical disease , medication , medical history ) ; 2 . Prenatal data ( gestational age , ultrasound MRI finding , result amniocentesis , vital sign ) 3 . Fetal intervention ( surgery information , gestational age , complication , post-procedure follow-up include ultrasound ) ; 4 . Intra-partum data ( ultrasound MRI finding , gestational age delivery , type labor , mode delivery , indication complication , status port site cesarean delivery ) ; 5 . Immediate neonatal period data ( birth weight , Apgar score , physical exam finding , hydrocephalus assessment , repair site condition , imaging , need surgery shunt placement , image result ) ; 6 . Long-term follow-up every 3-4 month first year , Year 1 , Year 2 , Year 3 , Year 4 , Year 5 ( physical exam finding , image result , hydrocephalus assessment ) . Like child spina bifida , participate child take care pediatric neurosurgery service birth . Follow-up visit occur Spina Bifida Clinic Texas Children 's Hospital . All follow visit consider standard care occur follow : After baby bear , leave hospital , physical exam , assessment hydrocephalus , urinary orthopedic evaluation , image brain . In first year , child visit every 3-4 month physical exam urinary orthopedic evaluation do . Year 1 Year 2 visit include : physical exam , developmental assessment , urinary orthopedic evaluation , assessment hydrocephalus . The Year 1 visit also include image child 's brain spine ( may repeat needed point ) . At Year 3 Year 4 , physical exam urinary orthopedic evaluation do . Year 5 end participation study . This visit include : physical exam , developmental assessment , assessment hydrocephalus image child 's spine head . After Year 5 , routine annual follow visit . If participant move away Texas , investigator attempt follow review mom child medical record The participant ask sign medical record release , every year need , allow occur . The participant may contact study staff regard change study ask sign new inform consent form . The participant may contact phone study staff medical release form change study .</detailed_description>
