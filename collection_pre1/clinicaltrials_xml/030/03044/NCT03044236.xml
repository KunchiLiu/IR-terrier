	<brief_title>Effect Novel Stretching Technique Shoulder Range Motion Voluntary Contraction Overhead Athletes With Glenohumeral Internal Rotation Deficits `` GIRD ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To examine compare effect novel stretching technique traditional stretch glenohumeral range motion , strength , maximum voluntary contraction , pain , subject satisfaction overhead athletes glenohumeral internal rotation deficit randomize clinical study . The investigator hypothesize type novel intervention help subject GIRD restore range motion , experience less pain maintain strength motor unit recruitment follow novel intervention . This help u assess potential beneficial effect intervention fill gap knowledge help health care professional adequately select right treatment modality . Independent Variable 1 . Type Intervention : - Traditional Stretching ( Modified Sleep Stretch ) . VS - Novel Stretching ( Active Shoulder Internal Rotation Bridging ) 2 . Time - Pre VS post intervention Dependent Variables 1 . Glenohumeral internal rotation ROM 2 . Maximal glenohumeral external rotation isometric strength . 3 . Mean motor unit recruitment ( EMG ) glenohumeral external rotator ( infraspinatus ) internal rotators ( pectoralis major latissumus dorsi ) 4 . Pain 5 . Subject satisfaction Instrumentation : 1 . Glenohumeral internal &amp; external rotation ROM : measure baseline week four-post intervention participant . We use digital inclinometer . Research ( Kolber et al.,2011 ) show instrument reliable intra-rater ICC =0.87 inter-rater ICC =0.93 2 . Electronic push/pull dynamometer : At end feel ROM , ROM measure , therapist apply amount pressure subject ensure reliable/ valid ROM measurement . 3 . Maximal Glenohumeral External Rotation Isometric Strength measure use MicroFET2 handheld digital dynamometer . This device show reliable intra-rater ICC =0.85 inter-rater ICC =0.85 . 4 . Maximum Voluntary Contraction : measure use 44 Delsys Bagnoli portable surface electromyography ( sEMG ) system . 5 . Pain : measure use Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) . The NPRS show valid , reliable appropriate use clinical practice Procedures : All participant perform static stretching ( SS ) condition . The two stretch technique home-based program .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Participants must age 18 45 . Perform overhead sport activity past 3 month . Participants require display ≥ 20° less glenohumeral internal rotation ROM dominant shoulder compare non dominate shoulder . Participants include without pain shoulder activity . Will exclude participant still recover previous surgery shoulder elbow complex past 3 month , currently receive medical intervention shoulder .</criteria>
