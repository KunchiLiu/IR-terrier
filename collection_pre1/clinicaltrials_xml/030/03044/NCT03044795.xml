	<brief_summary>In tumor defect homologous recombination ( HR ) pathway , double-strand break repair partly impaired . Patients HR deficient tumor benefit therapy induce DNA lesion require HR repair . These therapy include platinum compound inhibitor enzyme PARP-1 . At moment , selection PARP inhibitor treatment relies detection germ-line somatic mutation HR pathway gene BRCA1 BRCA2 . However , HR deficient tumor BRCA gene mutation , BRCA gene also silence promoter methylation . Moreover , HR pathway defective due mutation HR gene . In addition , presence BRCA gene mutation guarantee defective HR since mutation gene ( e.g . TP53BP1 ) restore HR despite presence BRCA1 mutation . Since patient tumor HR deficient may benefit PARP inhibition , good tool require identify patient . Recently , functional ex vivo test HR deficiency ( RAD51 assay ) become available clinical use . The RAD51 assay identify patient functional defect HR-repair may predict cancer patient likely benefit PARP inhibition . The purpose study investigate whether RAD51 assay select patient benefit treatment PARP-inhibitor veliparib .</brief_summary>
