	<brief_title>Focused Assessed Echocardiography Predict Fluid Responsiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As different strategy perioperative fluid management discussion choice liberal restrictive one occurs ? Individualized infusion therapy goal . The investigator hypothesize extended hemodynamic monitoring base focused transthoracic echocardiography enable differentiate cause hypotension carefully fluid overload avoid major abdominal surgery . The goal study : - To conduct one group hypotensive patient major abdominal surgery . To divide group responder nonresponders fluid challenge . - To evaluate feasibility echocardiography monitor postoperative unit ( mind restrain supine position , postoperative pain , bandage etc . ) - To compare evaluation fluid responsiveness clinical sign focus assessed echocardiography data . - To identify best focused echocardiography parameter prognosis fluid responsiveness . - To determine extended hemodynamic monitoring change postoperative fluid management .</detailed_description>
