	<brief_title>Treatment Breast Fibroadenoma Targeted Tissue With HIFU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Echopulse specially design , manufacture CE mark treat breast fibroadenoma . HIFU completely alternative surgery utilizes high-energy ultrasound deliver large amount sound energy focal point rapidly induce tissue heat 85-90°C.This initiate tissue coagulation follow tissue necrosis ablate targeted area .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Female patient 18 year old diagnose breast fibroadenoma present least one fibroadenoma . 2 . Diagnosis fibroadenoma must base : 1 . Clinical examination 2 . Ultrasound image alone patient 35 year old . For woman old 35 year , mammogram perform addition ultrasound . The BIRADS score mammogram must 2 3 . BIRADS score 4 eligible biopsy indicate fibroadenoma concordance . 3 . Histologic confirmation core needle biopsy . 3 . Patient candidate surgery . 4 . The fibroadenoma treatment volume must least 5 mm 26 mm skin . This criterion evaluate immediately prior treatment , breast immobilize potentially compress . 5 . The rib cage prefocal ultrasound path behind target fibroadenoma ( minimum distance posterior wall fibroadenoma must least 10 mm ) . This criterion shall evaluate immediately prior treatment , breast immobilize potentially compress . 6 . The fibroadenoma 1 cm great large dimension le 7.5 mm anteriorposterior dimension ( measure ultrasound ) . Focal point HIFU treatment must also least 3 mm border fibroadenoma . 7 . Patient 's fibroadenoma size great equal 0.2 cc less 10 cc volume ( measure ultrasound day procedure ) . 8 . Fibroadenoma palpable . 9 . Pain ≥ 30mm/100mm measure VAS maximum level last 30 day 10 . Anxiety ≥ 30mm/100mm measure VAS maximum level last 30 day 11 . Patient sign write informed consent . 1 . Patient pregnant nursing . 2 . Presence calcify fibroadenoma . Calcification determine mammography . In woman &gt; 35 year old , diagnostic mammogram evaluate calcification . In woman ≤ 35 year old , single view mammogram affect breast sufficient evaluation calcification . Women ≤ 35 year old exclude base finding calcification single view mammogram . 3 . Patient history breast cancer history laser radiation therapy target breast . 4 . Patient breast implant target breast . 5 . Patient breast cyst within fibroadenoma treat . 6 . Patient 's fibroadenoma clearly visible ultrasound image ( B mode ) inclusion visit . 7 . Patient participate another clinical trial involve investigational drug , device biologic .</criteria>
