	<brief_summary>The Primary Objectives present study : - To Evaluate effect platelet rich fibrin matrix ( PRFM ) peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cell ( PBMSCs ) implant stability . - To Compare effect platelet rich fibrin matrix ( PRFM ) alone peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cell ( PBMSCs ) embed platelet rich fibrin matrix ( PRFM ) implant stability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Platelet Rich Fibrin Matrix With Without Peripheral Blood Mesenchymal Stem Cells Implant Stability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The addition molecules growth factor implant surface approach enhance bone implant contact ( BIC ) .1 Platelet rich fibrin matrix ( PRFM ) autologous concentrate platelet-rich thrombin free fibrin matrix , prepare two step centrifugation blood . Platelets isolate , remain intact retain growth factor compliment . This allow effective , sustain release growth factor wound site follow PRFM application.2 During second spin , cross-linking fibrin take place , result formation dense fibrin matrix , within concentration viable platelet find . Having organize fibrin matrix start heal accelerates speed vascular ingres wound compare non-accelerated healing , require long time fibrin formation development vascularity . The early vascularity establish , fast migration bone-forming cell wound site initiation bone formation . Therapeutic application platelet-rich product lead improved bone regeneration faster titanium implant osseointegration , improve stability maintenance dental implant increase BIC.1 Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) multipotent stromal cell prominent regenerative function . MSCs first identify isolated bone marrow find various tissue include umbilical cord , adipose tissue peripheral blood . Among source peripheral blood MSCs draw increase attention share similar biological characteristic MSCs derive bone marrow adipose tissue . Bone marrow derive mesenchymal stem cell ( BMMSCs ) multipotent cell capable differentiate osteoblast , chondrocytes , adipocytes , fibroblast , tenocytes , myoblasts , consider cell source various tissue repair regenerate bone defects.3 The requirement aspiration bone marrow patient cause pain morbidity donor site . It convenient peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cell ( PBMSCs ) could harvest expand enough number , osteogenic capacity maintain clinical permitted period . The literature search show human clinical trial conduct till date ass regenerative potential new modality i.e . PRFM peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cell . This study therefore aim evaluation PRFM PBMSCs regenerative material implant stability .</detailed_description>
