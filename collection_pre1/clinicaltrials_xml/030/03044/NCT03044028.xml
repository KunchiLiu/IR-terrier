	<brief_summary>The current standard rehabilitation TKA consist guide exercise therapy 12 week surgery . This include inpatient , home , outpatient therapy . The surgery rehabilitation highly successful reduce eliminate pain experience preoperatively . However , QFM strength , overall function , knee range motion often worse preoperative level long 6 month surgery case may persist many year . Such quadriceps strength impairment TKA largely attribute voluntary activation deficit lead decrease functional performance decrease gait speed , decrease balance lead fall , decrease stair climb &amp; chair rise ability . Since therapy alone adequately restore improve upon preoperative functional capability consistent timely manner , suggest NMES use adjunctively postoperative rehabilitation alleviate quadriceps muscle activation deficit . Early NMES use TKA show : reduce knee extensor lag , increase walk speed , improve QFM strength , knee range motion , function . However , NMES initiate one month TKA lead improve QFM strength function beyond standard benefit gain exercise alone , thus suggest time NMES application TKA important . It previously show preoperative QFM strength predictive postoperative function [ 6 ] benefit prehabilitation remain question . To date , one pilot study assess benefit NMES initiate preoperatively . This study include 14 patient ( 9 NMES , 5 control ) able show preoperative NMES usage may lead great QFM strength gain TKA . Therefore , important ass benefit NMES preoperatively postoperatively order determine beneficial TKA patient .</brief_summary>
