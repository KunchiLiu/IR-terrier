	<criteria>Men woman age ≥ 18 year old Histologically proven ( squamous cell adenocarcinoma ) esophageal gastro esophageal junction cancer ( core biopsy require ) . Stage II/III disease per AJCC stag 7.0 Baseline image FDGPET scan endoscopic ultrasound within 28 day prior registration ECOG performance status 01 ( see Appendix B ) . Adequate oral intake/nutritional status without need enteral parenteral feed chemoradiation preoperative period Adequate organ function follow : Leukocytes ≥ 2,000/mm3 Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Bilirubin ( total ) within normal institutional limit ( except subject Gilbert Syndrome must total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL ) AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal PT international normalize ratio ( INR ) ≤ 1.5 ( inrange INR , usually 2 3 , patient stable dose therapeutic warfarin PTT ≤ upper limit normal Adequate cardiac function define : evidence PR prolongation AV block baseline electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Radiation oncology consultation within 28 day confirm disease encompass radiotherapy field normal tissue constraint meet . Subjects must adequate lung function permit surgical resection determine preenrollment pulmonary function test include DLCO follow : DLCO≥70 % predict OR DLCO &lt; 70 % ≥55 % VO2 max ≥10L/min/kg ( assess cardiopulmonary exercise test ) 6 minute walk test ≥500 meter Subjects DLCO &lt; 55 % exclude study . Subjects must baseline O2 saturation pulse oximetry ≥ 92 % rest walking , supplemental oxygen Esophagogastrectomies perform via laparotomy right thoracotomy enbloc removal perigastric , celiac , periesophageal subcarinal lymph node . Esophagogastric reconstruction perform level azygocaval junction use EEA staple device . Either formalin fixed paraffin block minimum ten 5micron tissue section 's ( slide ) tumor biopsy sample must available biomarker evaluation baseline repeat EGD . The effect nivolumab , develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation 5 month last dose nivolumab . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Sexually active fertile men must use effective barrier birth control partner WOCBP 7 month last dose nivolumab . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within two week registration . Patient understand study regimen , requirement , risk discomfort able willing sign inform consent form . Voluntary sign dated IRB/IEC approve write informed consent form accordance regulatory institutional guideline must obtain performance protocol relate procedure part normal patient care . Subjects must competent report AEs , understand drug dosing schedule use medication control AEs . Patient active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune thyroiditis require hormone replacement , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . Esophageal tumor locate mid esophagus high i.e . involve distal esophagus GE junction . Tumors whose proximal end high level carina Biopsy proven involvement supraclavicular lymph node Tumors must extend 5cm stomach Patient condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day first dose . Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement steroid dos permit absence active autoimmune disease . Subjects previous malignancy ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ bladder , gastric , breast , colon cervical cancers/dysplasia ) exclude unless complete remission achieve least 1 year prior study entry additional therapy ( adjuvant hormonal therapy breast cancer ) require anticipate required study period . Subjects brain metastasis exclude study patient brain imaging ( either MRI brain CT brain contrast ) prior enrollment . Subjects history interstitial lung disease . Active systemic infection require therapy , positive test Hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) . Known positive history positive test Human Immunodeficiency Virus Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . History allergy study drug component . Women pregnant nursing . WOBP Men female partner ( WOCBP ) willing use contraception . Prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCTLA4 antibody ( antibody target T cell coregulatory pathway ) . Underlying medical condition , Investigator 's opinion , make administration study drug hazardous obscure interpretation toxicity adverse event .
