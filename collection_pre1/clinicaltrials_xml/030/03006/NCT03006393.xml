	<brief_summary>The main purpose study examine effect infliximab measure relate depression symptom . Infliximab also know brand name Remicade . Infliximab , Remicade , give intravenous ( IV ) needle currently use treat rheumatoid arthritis Crohn 's disease . Infliximab think help condition reduce inflammation body . Infliximab ( Remicade ) reduce inflammation block chemical body call tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha . This chemical produce inflammation . Inflammatory chemical body like TNF-alpha appear increase people major depression . Researchers believe drug like infliximab , block TNF-alpha , may helpful treat depression .

	<detailed_description>The main purpose study examine effect infliximab measure relate depression symptom . Infliximab also know brand name Remicade . Infliximab , Remicade , give intravenous ( IV ) needle currently use treat rheumatoid arthritis Crohn 's disease . Infliximab think help condition reduce inflammation body . Infliximab ( Remicade ) reduce inflammation block chemical body call tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha . This chemical produce inflammation . Inflammatory chemical body like TNF-alpha appear increase people major depression . Researchers believe drug like infliximab , block TNF-alpha , may helpful treat depression . This double-blind , placebo-controlled study participant randomize receive one infusion infliximab placebo . This study ass neuroimaging measure corticostriatal circuitry placebo-controlled pharmacologic blockade inflammation 80 depressed patient ( n = 40 per group ) recruit ensure high level peripheral inflammation ( CRP &gt; 3mg/L ) . Primary aim evaluate whether 1 ) corticostriatal function reward motivation anticipation associate change peripheral inflammation follow pharmacologic blockade relative placebo 2 ) temporal dynamic change inflammation , gene- expression , reward motivation reinforcement learn behavior motivational symptom assess baseline , 24 hour , 3 day , 1 week two week post infliximab infusion , 3 ) test integrative multi- level path model determine whether change corticostriatal circuitry follow inflammation blockade mediates relationship change inflammation change motivational anhedonia symptom . These data provide validation inflammatory cytokine therapeutic target motivational symptom depression define symptom target biomarkers response future study .</detailed_description>
