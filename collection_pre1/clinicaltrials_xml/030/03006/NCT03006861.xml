	<brief_title>Delivra Topical Creatine Combined With Oral Creatine Improving Muscular Power</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Creatine monohydrate popular nutritional supplement athlete involve sport involve strength power . When creatine orally ingest combine inorganic phosphate form phorylcreatine ( PCr ) skeletal muscle . Adenosine Triphosphate ( ATP ) immediate source energy muscle - exercise ATP break Adenosine Diphosphate ( ADP ) inorganic phosphate . Duration high-intensity exercise limit second base limited ATP store muscle . PCr act re-phosphorylate ADP form ATP muscle contraction continue high intensity . After creatine monohydrate ingest , high-intensity exercise capacity increase increased PCr store muscle . Traditionally , creatine consume orally supplement . Delivra Inc. develop topical cream contain creatine design penetrate skin . The study purpose determine whether topically-applied creatine additive orally-ingested creatine improve muscular strength power . The hypothesis topically-applied creatine additive orally-ingested creatine improve muscular performance . The study involve double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group design . Participants ( n=132 ) randomize receive either oral creatine supplementation placebo ( 21 g/d ) 7 day . One leg participant randomize receive topical creatine ( 3.5 mL/d ) opposite leg placebo 7 day . The baseline assessment involve measure muscular power 5 set 15 repetition knee extension dynamometer , set separate 1 minute rest , leg test separately . Additional measure include assessment body composition body water content . Participants receive either oral creatine ( 21 g/d ) placebo 7 day . One leg participant randomize receive topical creatine ( 3.5 mL/d ) opposite leg placebo 7 day . The assessment do baseline repeat 7 day creatine supplementation . The primary outcome average peak power output .</detailed_description>
