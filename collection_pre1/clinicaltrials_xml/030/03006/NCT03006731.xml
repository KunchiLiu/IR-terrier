	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effect exercise training strategy call high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) moderate intensity continuous exercise ( MICE ) , walk function cardiovascular fitness stroke patient . Hypothesis : HIIT result significantly great benefit fitness mobility MICE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Intensity Interval Training People With Stroke Deficits</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using randomize design , study evaluate effect 3 HIT session combine 2 MICE session per week cardiovascular fitness mobility compare MICE train 5 days/week . Participants post-stroke randomly assign either MICE ( 5 day per week ( d∙wk-1 ) ) combine HIIT ( 3 d∙wk-1 ) MICE ( 2 d∙wk-1 ) . Both group exercise 5 time per week ( walk treadmill harness fall protection ) ; 3 time centre 2 time home . Outcome measure conduct 24 week training .</detailed_description>
