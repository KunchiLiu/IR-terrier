	<brief_summary>Despite increase interest emergency manual ( EMs ) , relatively little known effectiveness limitation perioperative setting . Prior study limit evaluated EMs use crisis tailor-made match one chapter , minimal participation attend surgeon experience personnel . The Investigators ' preliminary experience suggest less-than-expected EM use suboptimal usage , may due simulation scenario fall `` halfway '' two different chapter EM , raise question whether limitation due EM content , team dynamic , inadequate training EM use . In randomized , prospective , two-center simulation-based study , investigator utilize clinical scenario specifically design observe pattern use test limitation EMs . The hypothesis EMs may improve , may even worsen , clinical performance situation exactly match specific chapter EM , EM usage pattern identify strengths limitation tool implementation . The participate healthcare provider consist experienced surgeon , anesthesiologist , nurse randomize four experimental group , expose either `` specific '' `` non-specific '' simulation scenario , along without availability EM . The major experimental endpoint many `` critical action '' team performs , score percentage action take pre-determined list . The goal study improve EM content use understanding limitation interprofessional team-training simulation study whether EMs enhance detract clinical performance . This especially concern situation exactly match specific chapter EM , case vague represent multi-factorial diagnostic dilemma hypotension hypoxemia . The ultimate goal strengthen patient safety provide guidance improve EM content , use , training protocol .</brief_summary>
