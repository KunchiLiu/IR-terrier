	<brief_title>Comparison 3 Modes Genetic Counseling High-Risk Public Hospital Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims . The specific aim mixed method study : Aim 1 . Compare effectiveness 3 mode genetic counseling diverse sample patient high risk HBOC 3 public hospital . Conduct multicenter partially randomize preference noninferiority trial high-risk patient assign ( ) randomization three counsel mode : in-person , phone , video conference ; ( b ) patients´ preference . Utilize validated measure study outcomes adapt need literacy language . Recognizing potential participant may strong preference one counseling mode , explain study design obtain informed consent , participant ask preference . Those offer mode , randomize . Randomization stratify accord hospital personal history breast cancer order ensure imbalance important factor may associate outcome . Aim 2 . Explore inductively qualitatively variation patient ' genetic counseling experience understanding , genetic counselor satisfaction perception , counsel session similarity difference , implication organizational context across three mode genetic counseling . Aim 3 employs inductive , qualitative method explore depth case 30 patient use pre- post-counseling survey response , audio tape counsel session , in-depth interview explore question common respondent specific learn individual data source . In-depth interview also conduct genetic counselor . Study Design : Using mixed method , investigator conduct multicenter partially randomize preference noninferiority trial high-risk English- , Spanish- , Cantonese-speaking patient assign ( 1 ) patients´ preference ( 2 ) randomization three counsel mode : ( ) in-person ; ( b ) phone ; ( c ) video conference . A total 600 patient complete counsel 540 complete final survey . Baseline post-counseling survey use validated measure ( adapt literacy language ) study outcome . All counseling session audio-taped . A sample 90 tape analyze counsel content identify 30 participant in-depth interview analysis triangulate form data . Genetic counselor interview depth elicit perception strengths limitation counsel mode . Investigators ' mixed method combine multicenter partially randomize preference noninferiority trial inductive method embed research real world public health system patient . This practice-based research , design emphasize external validity , ( relevance generalizability enhance translation actual use ) , well internal validity . The purpose non-inferiority trial compare intervention active control standard treatment intervention expect superior efficacy , benefit , e.g. , great convenience few side effect . In case genetic counseling , in- person counsel standard care , well-documented efficacy.4 Since video telephone counsel offer personalize approach pertinent content in-person counseling , seem unlikely either mode would produce superior psychosocial outcome great knowledge gain ; similarly , investigator expect telephone counsel efficacious video counseling . The gold standard assess effectiveness intervention randomize clinical trial ; yet patient strong preference one intervention condition may decline participate , threat external validity , ( randomize ) participate half-heartedly drop , threaten internal validity . Investigators address issue partially randomize preference trial patient strong preference assign preferred treatment ( i.e. , intervention condition ) without strong preference randomize . This study design enable comparison treatment outcome among patient receive preferred treatment ( desire real world situation ) ascertainment effect preference—as well evaluation treatment outcomes randomized trial . However , comparison involve preference participant subject confounding , since patient prefer particular treatment may differ way affect outcome . In analysis involve preference participant possible reduce confound substantially use covariate adjustment . Nevertheless , residual confounding may present , preference participant outcome consider observational data . Investigators blend qualitative quantitative , deductive inductive method use varied form data in-depth interview , survey , audio tap observation . This allow u address central question different perspective triangulate analysis rich understand patient-counselor- institution relationship complex describe use one dimension alone ( e.g. , cognitive understanding capture survey ) . While randomized trial gold standard comparative effectiveness , answer question counsel interaction reassure anxiety-provoking patient ? technique enable patient recall important point ? conversation preclude recall ? It embed survey data open-ended inductive exploration audio observation investigator determine counselor provide much information low-literacy patient , alternatively use plain language emphasize key point , check frequently patient comprehension . Importantly , counselor able well phone video ? Thus , mixed method illuminate important dynamic informant may consciously aware .</detailed_description>
