STUDY METHODS Randomisation blind Randomisation determine use computerised random number generator equal randomisation intervention attention control , block randomisation design ensure equal number participant condition roll recruitment . The allocation sequence hold administrative member staff two researcher call person obtain group allocation enrol participant study . Participants blind arm study . Both group receive train session similar length , one focus specifically sound word offer general advice read child . The researcher enrol training participant obviously know group participant . However , post-intervention assessment carry different researcher blind group allocation . Assessments train Assessments train take place one name researcher , either family home University accord room availability family preference . The assessment questionnaire complete listed ( require child 's involvement ) . It may possible complete everything one long visit ( estimate two hour ) .

The intervention study power check effect intervention compare control check whether , participant intervention condition , socio-economic status ( SES ) explain intervention effect . To test , 55 participant per group need ( compare mean difference score intervention control condition independent t-test , run regression model difference score outcome measure SES continuous predictor ) .
