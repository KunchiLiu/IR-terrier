	<brief_summary>Understanding Daily Fluctuations Self-Regulation , also know Digital Marshmallow Test ( DMT ) , collaboration Northwell Health , Cornell Tech , Sage Bionetworks . Funded Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , pioneer study advance science identify help individual act short-term temptation , despite long-term consequence . Using Apple 's ResearchKit ( ™ ) Android 's ResearchStack application , Digital Marshmallow Test leverage powerful capability smartphone examine impulsivity use range game-like task sensor capability within mobile phone . Across study , impulsive individual significantly likely suffer obesity , Type II Diabetes , substance abuse , gamble problem , suicidal behavior , increase criminality among many problem . Early self-report study reveal relationship inability delay gratification different pattern mobile phone use . This first study develop non-invasive mobile method identify help great risk impulsive respond serious problem occur .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Poor self-regulation impulsivity underlie symptom numerous mental health problem obesity , substance abuse , Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) , gamble , binge eating , bipolar disorder , borderline personality disorder , suicidal behavior . This make one important personal public health intervention target . The classic Marshmallow Test do Mischel colleague determine inability delay gratification childhood predictive low Scholastic Aptitude Test ( SAT ) score high BMI adulthood . However , assessment impulsivity poor self-regulation rarely include routine medical care time financial constraint . The mobile phone change ability ass intervene individual remotely , provide avenue ambulatory diagnostic test just-in-time adaptive intervention access billion people . Newer method assessment use mobile phone , include Apple 's ResearchKit , provide opportunity powerful assessment impulsivity beyond simple self-report . To date , measure impulsivity integrate ResearchKit mobile application , aside beta version investigator recently build , research community explore possibility passive impulsivity assessment use mobile analytics embed phone . There preliminary evidence mobile analytics , latency respond text , predict personality trait associate impulsivity extroversion neuroticism , self-report study reveal direct relationship inability delay gratification different pattern mobile phone use . These study highlight potential power mobile phenotyping ubiquitous measure health determinant billion people use passive data n't require user participation . However , foundational research need validate assessment , build adaptive tool , include individual difference self-regulation capacity well intervention improve regulation discussion . The investigator propose test new diagnostic self-regulation mobile assessment tool app . The application build Apple 's ResearchKit ( ™ ) Android 's ResearchStack ( ™ ) include self-report assessment , three continuous performance task , passive data collection develop in-person use . The goal differentiate high low impulsive people use mobile assessment tool , investigator identify great risk self-regulation problem . Individuals higher impulsivity less self-control faced short-term temptation regardless knowledge consequence choice . This would first step develop completely remote measurement tool purpose . The primary goal exploratory project develop validate mobile application test impulsivity remotely , test self-report indicator impulsivity via mobile assessment correlate objective impulsivity test mobile phone . Because exploratory study , investigator look often participant use mobile app real-world task perform time leave laboratory . In addition , investigator test validity measure time .</detailed_description>
