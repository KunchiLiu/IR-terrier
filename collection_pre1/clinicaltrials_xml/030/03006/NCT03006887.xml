	<criteria>Histologically and/or cytologically confirm select solid tumor type progress treatment standard therapy appropriate therapy available . If nivolumab pembrolizumab approve therapy participant 's tumor type , participant treat , investigator may enroll participant study . The selected tumor type : nonsmall cell lung cancer , predominantly clear cell renal cell carcinoma , endometrial carcinoma , urothelial carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma head neck , melanoma ( exclude uveal melanoma ) At least 1 measurable target lesion accord modify Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 Participants must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status ( PS ) 0 1 . Adequately control blood pressure ( BP ) without antihypertensive medication , define BP ≤150/90 millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) Screening change antihypertensive medication within 1 week prior Cycle 1/Day 1 ( C1D1 ) Adequate renal function define creatinine ≤1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) calculate creatinine clearance ≥40 milliliter per minute ( mL/min ) per Cockcroft Gault formula creatinine level &gt; 1.5×ULN Adequate bone marrow function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1500/mm^3 ( ≥1.5×10^3/microliters [ μL ] ) Platelets ≥100,000/mm^3 ( ≥100×10^9/liters [ L ] ) Hemoglobin ≥9.0 gram per deciliter ( g/dL ) Adequate blood coagulation function evidence International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) ≤1.5 Adequate liver function evidence bilirubin ≤1.5×ULN alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤3×ULN ( case liver metastasis ≤5×ULN ) . In case ALP &gt; 3×ULN ( absence liver metastasis ) &gt; 5×ULN ( presence liver metastasis ) AND participant also know bone metastasis , liverspecific ALP must separate total use ass liver function instead total ALP . Males females age ≥20 year time inform consent Life expectancy 12 week Participants know brain metastasis eligible complete primary brain therapy ( whole brain radiotherapy , stereotactic radiosurgery , complete surgical resection ) remain clinically stable , asymptomatic , steroid least 28 day . Voluntary agreement provide write informed consent willingness ability comply aspects protocol Archival tumor tissue newly obtain biopsy must available prior first dose study drug biomarker analysis . Participants inaccessible tumor biopsy specimen enrol without biopsy upon consultation agreement sponsor . Note : In case submit unstained cut slide , freshly cut slide submit test laboratory within 14 day slide cut . Prior anticancer treatment within 28 day ( 5 time halflife time , whichever short ) investigational agent within 28 day prior first dose study drug . All toxicity relate prior treatment must resolve Grade ≤1 ( except alopecia ) . Note : Refer inclusion criterion regard hypertension . Biologic response modifier ( e.g. , granulocyte colonystimulating factor ) within 4 week study entry . Chronic erythropoietin therapy permit provide dose adjustment make within 2 month first dose study treatment . Prior treatment lenvatinib antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent , exclude cancer type melanoma nonsmall cell lung cancer prior treatment one antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent allow Participants must recover adequately complication major surgery prior start therapy . Participants ≥2+ proteinuria urinalysis undergo 24hour urine collection quantitative assessment proteinuria . Participants urine protein ≥1 g/24 hour ineligible . Gastrointestinal malabsorption , gastrointestinal anastomosis , condition might affect absorption lenvatinib New York Heart Association congestive heart failure grade II , unstable angina , myocardial infarction within past 6 month , serious cardiac arrhythmia associate significant cardiovascular impairment within past 6 month Prolongation QTc ( Fridericia formula ) interval &gt; 480 millisecond ( m ) Active hemoptysis ( bright red blood least 0.5 teaspoon ) within 3 week prior first dose study drug Bleeding thrombotic disorder participant risk severe hemorrhage . The degree tumor invasion/infiltration major blood vessel ( e.g. , carotid artery ) consider potential risk severe hemorrhage associate tumor shrinkage/necrosis follow lenvatinib therapy . Active infection ( infection require systemic treatment ) Participant know positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture Known intolerance either study drug ( excipients ) History organ allograft Any medical condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation clinical trial Excluding primary tumor lead enrollment study , active malignancy ( except definitively treat melanoma insitu , basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma insitu bladder cervix ) within past 24 month Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose study treatment . The use physiologic dos corticosteroid ( 7.5 milligram per day [ mg/d ] prednisone equivalent ) may approve consultation sponsor . Active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e. , use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( e.g. , thyroxine [ T4 ] , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Has history ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid current pneumonitis , history interstitial lung disease Has receive livevirus vaccination within 30 day plan treatment start . Seasonal flu vaccine contain live virus permit . Females breastfeed pregnant Screening Baseline ( document positive betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [ βhCG ] human chorionic gonadotropin [ hCG ] test minimum sensitivity 25 International unit per liter [ IU/L ] equivalent unit βhCG [ hCG ] ) . A separate baseline assessment require negative screening pregnancy test obtain 72 hour first dose study drug . Females childbearing potential : agree use highly effective method contraception entire study period 120 day study drug discontinuation , i.e . : total abstinence ( preferred usual lifestyle ) intrauterine device ( IUD ) hormone release system ( intrauterine system [ IUS ] ) contraceptive implant oral contraceptive ( additional barrier method ) ; vasectomize partner confirm azoospermia . For site outside European Union ( EU ) , permissible highly effective method contraception appropriate acceptable participant , participant must agree use medically acceptable method contraception , ie double barrier method contraception condom plus diaphragm cervical/vault cap spermicide . NOTES : All female consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal ( amenorrheic least 12 consecutive month , appropriate age group , without know suspected cause ) sterilize surgically ( i.e. , bilateral tubal ligation , total hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , surgery least 1 month dose ) . Participants must stable dose oral hormonal contraceptive product least 4 week dose study drug duration study . Male participant partner woman childbearing potential must use condom plus spermicide , female partner , childbearing potential , must use highly effective method contraception ( see method describe Exclusion Criterion # 23 ) begin least 1 menstrual cycle prior start study drug ( ) , throughout entire study period , 120 day last dose study drug , unless male participant totally sexually abstinent undergone successful vasectomy confirm azoospermia unless female partner sterilize surgically otherwise proven sterile .</criteria>
