	<brief_summary>Autoimmune PAP rare lung disease affect less 5,000 individual US FDA-approved pharmacologic therapy . Results `` off-label '' use case report clinical study complete outside US indicate inhale rhGM-CSF may safe effective thera-py autoimmune PAP . Preliminary clinical trial inhale rhGM-CSF autoimmune PAP patient show promising result , 62 % -96 % therapeutic response rate without identifiable drug-related adverse effect least 73 autoimmune PAP patient . However , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) , optimal dose , treatment duration maximize efficacy unknown . The goal begin address knowledge gap inhale sargramostim autoimmune PAP patient pilot safety PK/PD study ( TPSC-110 ) . TPSC-110 , PharmPAP , self-controlled open-label , phase I study evaluate safety , PK , PD inhale sargra-mostim autoimmune PAP patient . These result impact field 1 ) confirm exist publish data , 2 ) monitoring local effect inhale sargramostim autoimmune PAP patient , 3 ) potentially demonstrate safe start dose later trial evaluate therapeutic efficacy inhale sargramostim autoimmune PAP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PAP rare syndrome surfactant accumulation result hypoxemic respiratory failure occur number disease classify pathogenically three group : primary PAP ( cause disruption GM-CSF signal - autoimmune PAP , hereditary PAP ) , secondary PAP ( cause reduction alveolar macrophage number and/or function ) , surfactant dysfunction-related PAP ( cause mutation gene require normal surfactant production ) . In current clinical practice , PAP diagnose base lung biopsy ; approach able identify etiology PAP . Current therapy involve physical removal surfactant procedure lung repeatedly fill saline empty - whole lung lavage , invasive , inefficient , widely available , especially child . Importantly , research advance elucidate pathogenesis disease cause PAP patient identify new diagnostic therapeutic approach . Simple blood-based research test identify PAP-causing disease 95 % patient . Further , several promise potential disease-specific therapy currently development . Preliminary clinical trial inhale rhGM-CSF autoimmune PAP patient show promising result , 62 % -96 % therapeutic response rate two dos ( 250 500 mcg/day ) without identify safety concern . At least 73 people autoimmune PAP report receive inhaled sargramostim identify drug-related adverse effect . However , PK , PD , optimal dose , treatment duration need maximize efficacy unknown . The short-term goal address knowledge gap inhale sargramostim autoimmune PAP patient follow clinical study : pilot safety PK/PD study ( TPSC-110 ) . A major goal protocol evaluate local systemic safety , PK , PD one dose inhale sargramostim autoimmune PAP . The central hypothesis patient autoimmune PAP , aerosol inhalation sargramostim well-tolerated safe GM-CSF autoantibody limit detection free GM-CSF thereby prevent local systemic toxicity . The specific objective study : 1 ) evaluate safety profile one dose inhale sargramostim patient autoimmune PAP 2 ) estimate PK profile inhale sargramostim follow single dose administration patient autoimmune PAP 3 ) measure PD effect inhale sargramostim follow single dose administration patient autoimmune PAP . The target population adult autoimmune PAP measurable , clinically significant disease satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion . The study design involve recruitment , screening , enrollment participant phase I , open-label , multi-site study . Sargramostim administer autoimmune PAP patient via aerosol inhalation one time dose 125 mcg 250 mcg . Adverse event ( AEs ) , serious AEs ( SAEs ) , PK , PD parameter evaluate ( see Appendix 3 Schedule Events ) . The experimental approach evaluate 1 ) safety inhale sargramostim document occurrence treatment-emergent AEs SAEs , 2 ) PK profile GM-CSF serum BAL fluid , 3 ) local systemic PD effect inhale GM-CSF 4 ) effect inhale GM-CSF quality life participant . Anticipated result determine safety profile inhale sargramostim patient autoimmune PAP , evaluate total free GM-CSF level blood lung , effect sargramostim blood BAL cell count , differential , baseline- GM-CSF-responsiveness blood leukocyte BAL cell , biomarkers PAP patient autoimmune PAP single dose administration . These result impact field 1 ) confirm exist publish data , 2 ) monitoring local effect inhale sargramostim autoimmune PAP patient , 3 ) demonstrate safe start dose evaluate efficacy inhale sargramostim autoimmune PAP .</detailed_description>
