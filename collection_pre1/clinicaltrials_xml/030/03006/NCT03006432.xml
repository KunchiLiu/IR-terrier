	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer fourth common cancer second large cause mortality cancer . Surgical resection localise form gastric cancer offer chance cure . The vast majority patient , however , present advance disease outset ( locally advance metastatic ) recurrent resection localise form . For metastatic locally advanced stage gastric gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma , combination 2 chemotherapy drug ( dual therapy ) compare monotherapy chemotherapy , make possible improve tumour response patient survival . Dual therapy comprise cisplatin + fluoropyrimidine ( CF protocol ) consider one first-line chemotherapy treatment standard . The addition docetaxel CF regime ( refer DCF protocol ) make possible improve tumour response rate , time tumour progression overall survival randomise phase III trial . This improvement treatment efficacy achieve , however , expense significant increase grade 3-4 toxicity , include diarrhoea , neutropenia , neutropenia complication . Although DCF consider therapeutic standard advance form gastric cancer , use limit clinical practice due high toxicity . Oxaliplatin show usefulness treatment oesophagogastric cancer , efficacy least equal cisplatin . Peripheral sensory neuropathy less common 5FU-cisplatin arm . In term treatment efficacy , 5FU-oxaliplatin versus 5FU-cisplatin associate non-significant improvement median progression free survival rate , overall survival . All data thus suggest 5FU-oxaliplatin least efficacious well tolerate 5FU-cisplatin , also docetaxel-5FU-cisplatin efficacious 5FU-cisplatin , limited use due high toxicity . In logical continuation development chemotherapy protocol metastatic gastric cancer , question therefore arise usefulness add docetaxel 5FU-oxaliplatin , term efficacy also tolerance . In France , chemotherapy FOLFOX use extensively first line treatment advance gastric cancer , progression-free survival median survival rate still low , poor response rate . The use docetaxel dose 50 mg/m2 every 2 week combination FOLFOX ( TFOX protocol ) show interesting result phase II study term efficacy tolerability , worth confirm phase III randomise trial . In fact , result confirm phase III , TFOX could become new first-line therapeutic standard advance gastric cancer , limit toxicity preserve patient ' quality life , could become reference treatment accompany target therapy currently develop disease . The primary objective randomise phase III trial compare progression-free survival dual therapy 5FU-oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX protocol ) triple therapy 5FU-oxaliplatin-docetaxel ( TFOX protocol ) treatment advance form gastric oesophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma . The secondary objective overall survival , tumour response rate , toxicity , quality life therapeutic index , define ratio median progression-free survival febrile neutropenia rate .</brief_summary>
