	<detailed_description>Epidemiological study show bad posture poor body control occur puberty , forward head posture ( FHP ) round shoulder common biomechanical deviation sagittal plane . The FHP define anterior displacement head hyperextension cervical spine associate reduction length upper portion trapezius , posterior portion cervical extensor muscle , sternocleidomastoid levator scapula . FHP evaluate measure craniovertebral angle ( CVA ) define angle horizontal line pass C7 line extend tragus ear C7 . CVA , small 50 degree , constitute criterion abnormal posture cervical spine , suggest FHP . People FHP present incomplete balance control , thereby affect position center gravity motor control body . The establishment alter motor control strategy could lead balance disorder , neck muscle imbalance , chronic neck pain even respiratory dysfunction . Despite effort researcher create effective treatment program base strength train stretching exercise , positive long-term result problem FHP correction . For reason , re-education posture body alignment , exercise program base motor learning , cognitive element ( attention , motivation , feedback , reason ) , could prove effective therapeutic strategy .</detailed_description>
