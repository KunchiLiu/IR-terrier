	<brief_title>SCD-PROMIS : A Software Platform Enhance Self-efficacy Patient-provider Engagement Patients With Sickle Cell Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain main reason SCD patient admit readmitted hospital . In fact , readmission rate SCD patient higher asthmatic diabetic . In order reduce 30-day hospital readmission rate improve patient care quality , Affordable Care Act Centers Medicare Medicaid Services establish Readmissions Reduction Program . In keep effort , investigator propose methodology support technology potential change way SCD patient monitor hospital discharge turn , decrease readmission rate . This methodology also potential enhance quality life SCD patient improve patient reporting , self-efficacy , increase patient/provider engagement worsen pain increase admission/readmission risk . This software platform use validate Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) measure remotely monitor SCD patient ' pain relate outcome hospital discharge . With initial study , investigator propose use monitor platform identify predictor readmission , develop readmission prediction engine , design next version app build intervention address readmission risk . This monitoring platform could also increase healthcare provider engagement worsen patient ' pain and/or increase risk readmission . In order build optimize monitoring platform , investigator assemble team engineer , hematologist , pain researcher , statistician work together , collectively expertise develop test feasibility predictive value application large population SCD patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Participants Sickle Cell Disease ( SCD ) ( HbSS , HbSC , HbSβ0 thalassemia , HbSβ+ thalassemia , HbSOArab ) admit hospital vasoocclusive crisis ( VOE ) relate pain within age range 8 21 year . 2 . Ability provide inform consent/assent , comply study related procedure , evaluation , followup . In event patient smart mobile device ( i.e. , one support study application ) , one provide patient . Patients young age 11 year may use parent phone one . If patient smart mobile device parent want use device study , patient may use parent 's phone instead . 3 . Parent participant SCD ( HbSS , HbSC , HbSβ0 thalassemia , HbSβ+ thalassemia HbSOArab ) admit hospital vasoocclusive crisis ( VOE ) relate pain within age range 8 17 year assent participate study . 4 . Ability provide inform consent , comply study related procedure , evaluation , followup . In event parent mobile device , one provide duration study . 1 . Inability give inform consent/assent determine investigator 2 . Patients SCD admit reason VOErelated pain 3 . Parents patient SCD admit reason VOErelated pain assent participate</criteria>
