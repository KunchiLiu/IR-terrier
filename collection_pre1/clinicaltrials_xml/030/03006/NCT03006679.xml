	<criteria>1 . Willingness comply study procedure provide sign write informed consent prior studyspecific procedure ; however , unable , participant 's legally authorize representative may provide write consent approve institutionalspecific guideline . Participants unconscious consider investigator clinically unable consent Screening enter study consent legally authorize representative , provide write informed consent continue participate study soon possible recovery , applicable accordance local regulation . 2 . Hospitalized male female participant , ≥18 year age . 3 . Females must surgically sterile least 2 year postmenopausal , childbearing potential , negative screen urine pregnancy test willing practice sexual abstinence use accept form contraception partner ( example , barrier hormonal method ) treatment least 28 day last dose study drug . 4 . Expectation , opinion Investigator , participant 's infection require treatment IV antibiotic minimum 7 day . 5 . Have confirm diagnosis HABP VABP require antibiotic therapy meeting clinical , microbiological , radiographic criterion define follow : For HABP participant : To meet study definition HABP , participant must meet following clinical , microbiological , radiographic criterion : 1 . A chest radiograph ( chest Xray [ CXR ] , magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] compute tomography [ CT ] ) reveal presence new progressive pulmonary infiltrate ( ) consistent bacterial pneumonia within 48 hour prior randomization . 2 . Onset symptoms least 48 hour hospitalization within 7 day discharge inpatient acute chronic care facility ( example , longterm care , rehabilitation center , hospital , skilled nursing home ) . 3 . Have least one following : 1 . Temperature ≥38.0 degree Celsius ( 100.4 degree Fahrenheit ) ≤35 degree Celsius ( 95.0 degree Fahrenheit ) . 2 . Peripheral white blood cell ( WBC ) count ≥10,000 cells/cubic millimeter ( mm^3 ) ≤4,500 cells/mm^3 . 3 . ≥15 percent immature neutrophil ( band form ) regardless total WBC count . 4 . Have least one following : 1 . New onset cough expectorate sputum production ( worsen baseline cough ) . 2 . Auscultatory finding pulmonary examination consistent bacterial pneumonia pulmonary consolidation ( example , rale , dullness percussion , bronchial breath sound , ego phony ) . 3 . Dyspnea tachypnea ( , respiratory rate great 25 breaths/minute ) . 4 . Hypoxemia ( O2 saturation ≤90 percent pO2 ≤60 millimeter mercury [ mmHg ] breathing room air , worsen O2 saturation/FiO2 ) . 5 . New onset need mechanical ventilation . 6 . A deep respiratory secretion specimen collect within 48 hour prior randomization development clinical sign symptom HABP ( ideally prior administration systemic antimicrobial therapy ) . This obtained via sputum sample ( expectorated sputum ) , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) ( include protect BAL miniBAL ) , protect specimen brush ( PSB ) , endotracheal tube aspirate ( ETA ) , pleural fluid , lung parenchyma ( openlung , transthoracic , transbronchial biopsy ) . 7 . This deep respiratory secretion sample must meet adequacy criterion test , send local regional laboratory Gram stain culture ( result Gram stain culture available enrollment ) . For VABP participant : To meet study definition VABP , participant must meet following clinical , microbiological , radiographic criterion : 1 . A chest radiograph ( CXR , MRI CT ) reveal presence new progressive pulmonary infiltrate ( ) consistent bacterial pneumonia within 48 hour prior randomization . 2 . Receiving mechanical ventilation via endotracheal intubation tracheostomy great equal 48 hour . 3 . Have least one following : 1 . Temperature ≥38.0 degree Celsius ( 100.4 degree Fahrenheit ) ≤35 degree Celsius ( 95.0 degree Fahrenheit ) . 2 . Peripheral white blood cell ( WBC ) count ≥10,000 cells/mm^3 ≤4,500 cells/mm^3 . 3 . ≥15 percent immature neutrophil ( band form ) regardless total WBC count . 4 . Have least one following : 1 . New onset purulent respiratory secretion lungs new onset increase need respiratory secretion suction . 2 . Auscultatory finding pulmonary examination consistent bacterial pneumonia pulmonary consolidation ( example , rale , dullness percussion , bronchial breath sound , egophony ) . 3 . Worsening gas exchange ( ratio partial pressure arterial oxygen fraction inspire oxygen [ PaO2/FiO2 ] ≤240 PaO2 ≤60 mmHg ) lead acute change ventilator support system ( minimum daily FiO2 value increase least 0.20 daily minimum FiO2 precede 48 hour , minimum daily positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) value increase least 3 centimeter ( cm ) H2O daily minimum PEEP precede 48 hour ) . 5 . A deep respiratory secretion specimen must collect within 48 hour prior randomization development clinical sign symptom VABP ( ideally prior administration systemic antimicrobial therapy ) . This obtained via BAL ( include protect BAL miniBAL ) , PSB , ETA , pleural fluid , lung parenchyma ( openlung , transthoracic , transbronchial biopsy ) . 6 . The deep respiratory secretion sample must meet adequacy criterion test send local regional laboratory Gram stain culture ( result Gram stain culture available enrollment ) . Participants meet follow exclusion criterion enrol study : 1 . History severe hypersensitivity betalactam antibiotic ( example , cephalosporin , penicillin , carbapenems ) . 2 . History severe allergic reaction would preclude use either aminoglycosides adjunctive grampositive antimicrobial ( , allergy glycopeptides oxazolidinones ) . 3 . Requirement anticipate need additional systemic antibiotic ( study drug ) antifungal , include prophylactic antimicrobial antifungal . 4 . Requirement anticipate need 14 day systemic antimicrobial therapy treat HABP VABP . 5 . Known deeptissue infection ( include undrained abscess , meningitis , endocarditis , osteomyelitis ) within 7 day prior randomization . 6 . Participant receive 24 hour potentially effective systemic antibacterial therapy current episode HABP VABP within 72 hour randomization . Exceptions : 1 . Evidence clinical failure current episode HABP VABP ( example , worsen sign symptom ) follow least 48 hour prior systemic antimicrobial therapy ( participant evidence clinical failure piperacillin/tazobactam eligible inclusion ) , 2 . The clinical symptom sign current episode HABP VABP start least 48 hour prior antibacterial therapy initiate . 7 . Pulmonary disease precludes evaluation therapeutic response ( include , limited , lung cancer , active tuberculosis , cystic fibrosis , granulomatous disease , fungal pulmonary infection , pulmonary embolism , lung abscess , pleural empyema , post obstructive pneumonia ) . 8 . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positivity meet acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) define illness document CD4 count &lt; 200/ microliter ( μL ) within past year . 9 . Treatment within 30 day prior enrollment bonemarrow suppressive chemotherapy ( nonbone marrow suppressive chemotherapy permit ) , high dose steroid , immunosuppressive medication transplantation , medication rejection transplantation . 10 . Fulminant hepatitis ; current cirrhosis clinical manifestation endstage liver disease ( example , ascites hepatic encephalopathy ) ; acute hepatic failure acute decompensation chronic hepatic failure ; aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) level great 5fold upper limit normal total bilirubin great 3fold upper limit normal use local regional laboratory reference value . 11 . Requirement peritoneal dialysis continuous renal replacement therapy ( include continuous venovenous hemofiltration [ CVVH ] , continuous venovenous hemodialysis [ CVVHD ] , continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration [ CVVHDF ] ) ( Note , standard intermittent hemodialysis exclusionary ) . 12 . Females pregnant breastfeeding . 13 . Participation study involve administration investigational agent device within 30 day prior randomization study previous participation current study study vaborbactam meropenem vaborbactam . 14 . Any condition would make participant , opinion Investigator , unsuitable study ( example , would place participant risk compromise quality data ) , include participant high likelihood death within 72 hour randomization despite adequate antimicrobial therapy HABP VABP participants `` resuscitate '' order . 15 .
