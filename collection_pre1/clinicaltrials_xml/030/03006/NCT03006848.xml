	<brief_summary>This clinical trial seek determine avelumab effective facilitating removal gross tumor event relapse osteosarcoma pediatric patient . Avelumab evaluate use dose previously determine adult study . Primary Objectives : - To estimate response rate 4 cycle avelumab patient recurrent progressive osteosarcoma . - To estimate 16-week progression free survival patient recurrent progressive osteosarcoma treatment avelumab . Secondary Objective : - To describe toxicity associate administration avelumab patient recurrent progressive osteosarcoma . Exploratory Objectives : - To explore factor associate response patient treat avelumab recurrent progressive osteosarcoma ( e.g . tumor PD-L1 expression ) . - To measure parameter immune activation include subset peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) serum marker immune activation . - To evaluate role T-cells immune checkpoint blockade via measure cell proliferation , co-inhibitory receptor expression CD8 T cell , T cell repertoire , epigenetic programming .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Avelumab Patients With Recurrent Progressive Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 study use traditional Simon two-stage design . Patients 12 year great recurrent/refractory osteosarcoma administer avelumab dose 10 mg/kg intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 15 cycle , cycle last 28 day . Patients receive avelumab every 2 week cycle 28 day 24 month , 26 cycle . Progression free survival response therapy 4 cycle treatment assess . In addition , toxicity profile avelumab population closely monitor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must &gt; 12 year age &lt; 50 year age time enrollment . Patients must diagnosis recurrent progressive osteosarcoma . Patients must histologic verification osteosarcoma initial diagnosis . Patients must evidence recurrence progressive disease document within 2 week entry onto study . Patients must measurable disease , document clinical , radiographic histologic criterion . Disease must bidimensionally measurable computed tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Patients must performance status ≥ 50 use Karnofsky scale patient &gt; 16 year age Lansky scale patient ≤ 16 year age . Patients must life expectancy ≥ 6 week . Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study . 1 . Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : must receive within 3 week entry onto study . 2 . Biologic ( antineoplastic agent ) : least 7 day since completion therapy biologic agent . 3 . Immunotherapies : least 42 day must elapse since prior therapy include monoclonal antibody type immunotherapy ( e.g . chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T cell therapy ) . 4 . Radiation therapy ( RT ) : ≥ 2 week local palliative RT ( small port ) ; ≥ 6 month must elapse prior craniospinal RT ≥ 50 % radiation pelvis ; ≥ 6 week must elapse substantial bone marrow ( BM ) radiation . Organ Function Requirements : 1 . Adequate bone marrow function define : Peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 ( transfusion independent ) Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL ( may receive RBC transfusion ) 2 . Adequate renal function define : Creatinine clearance radioisotope GFR ≥70 mL/min/1.73m2 OR Serum creatinine base age/gender follow : ( threshold creatinine value derive Schwartz formula estimate GFR ) . Age : 12 &lt; 13 year , maximum creatinine 1.2 mg/DL male female . Age : 13 &lt; 16 year , maximum creatinine 1.5 mg/DL male 1.4 mg/DL female . Age : ≥16 year , maximum creatinine 1.7 mg/DL male 1.4 mg/DL female . 3 . Adequate liver function define : Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5x institutional upper limit normal ( IULN ) age ALT ( SGPT ) AST ( SGOT ) &lt; 2.5 x IULN age ( &lt; 5 x IULN patient document metastatic disease liver ) Serum albumin &gt; 2 g/dL 4 . Serum lipase ≤ upper limit normal ( IULN ) . 5 . Patients must document pulse oximetry ≥ 92 % room air . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day enrollment . Male female patient sexually active reproductive potential must agree use effective contraceptive method throughout study least 60 day last avelumab treatment administration . Abstinence acceptable form contraception . Patients must currently use investigational agent . Patients must currently use anticancer agent . Patients must able comply safety monitoring study opinion investigator . Written , inform consent assent follow Institutional Review Board , NCI , FDA OHRP guideline . Central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases . Current use immunosuppressive medication , EXCEPT follow : a. intranasal , inhale , topical steroid , local steroid injection ( e.g. , intraarticular injection ) ; b . Systemic corticosteroid physiologic dos ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ; c. Steroids premedication hypersensitivity reaction ( e.g. , CT scan premedication ) . Active autoimmune disease might deteriorate receive immunostimulatory agent . Patients diabetes type I , vitiligo , psoriasis , hypo hyperthyroid diseases require immunosuppressive treatment eligible . Active infection require systemic therapy . Known history test positive HIV know acquire immunodeficiency syndrome . Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection screen ( positive HBV surface antigen HCV RNA antiHCV antibody screen test positive ) . Patient receive vaccination within 4 week first dose avelumab trial prohibit except administration inactivate vaccine . Known prior severe hypersensitivity investigational product component formulation , include know severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody ( NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade ≥ 3 ) . Clinically significant ( i.e. , active ) cardiovascular disease : cerebral vascular accident/stroke ( &lt; 6 month prior enrollment ) , myocardial infarction ( &lt; 6 month prior enrollment ) , unstable angina , congestive heart failure ( ≥ New York Heart Association Classification Class II , see Appendix II ) , serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication . Persisting toxicity relate prior therapy ( NCI CTCAE v. 4.03 Grade &gt; 1 ) ; however , alopecia , sensory neuropathy Grade ≤ 2 , Grade ≤ 2 constitute safety risk base investigator 's judgment acceptable Other severe acute chronic medical condition include colitis , inflammatory bowel disease , pneumonitis , pulmonary fibrosis psychiatric condition include recent ( within past year ) active suicidal ideation behavior ; laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study treatment administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study . Patients active diarrhea &gt; CTCAE v4.03 Grade 2 . Patients previously receive prior organ transplantation , include allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Female patient pregnant actively breastfeed . Patients previously receive antiPD1 antiPDL1 therapy . Patients previously receive antiCTLA4 therapy ( e.g . ipilimumab ) eligible study .</criteria>
