	<brief_summary>The WHISH-2-Prevent Heart Failure ( HF ) study ancillary study Women 's Health Initiative Strong Healthy ( WHISH ) exercise pragmatic trial . The WHISH-2-Prevent HF trial examines intervention effect physical activity ( PA ) incident HF HF burden ( recurrent HF CVD death HF ) cost effective manner elderly woman . In addition , allow dose-finding analysis well understand type , intensity frequency PA lead reduce risk burden HF . The focus parent WHISH trial atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease heart failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A recently fund large pragmatic PA trial , Women 's Health Initiative Strong Healthy ( WHISH ) trial base upon two decade PA intervention experience use enhanced communication behavioral technique , randomize 49,936 elderly woman ( average age 79 ) evaluate intervention effect risk atherosclerotic CVD . This translational intervention aim reduce sedentary time achieve maintain aerobic strength enhance PA level currently recommend cardiovascular benefit . The WHISH-2-Prevent HF , represent first large primary prevention exercise trial ever perform focus HF examine intervention effect PA , incident HF HF burden ( recurrent HF CVD death HF ) cost effective manner elderly woman . In addition , allow dose-finding analysis well understand type , intensity frequency PA lead reduce risk burden HF . Aim 1 : Test whether old woman initially free HF randomize translational PA intervention reduce rate incident HF compare randomize translational PA intervention . H1 : Women free HF randomize PA intervention reduce rate incident HF compare randomize . Aim 2 : Test whether old woman without HF baseline randomize translational PA intervention reduce HF burden ( number acute HF hospitalization CVD death antecedent HF ) compare randomized translational PA intervention . H2 : Women randomize PA intervention reduce HF Burden compare randomize Exploratory Aim 3 : Analyze type , intensity frequency physical activity include skeletal muscle strengthen associate reduced risk HF HF burden elderly woman . H3 : Women low level sedentary behavior either increase maintain light intensity moderate intensity physical activity reduce rate HF compare woman remain sedentary . Those add skeletal muscle strengthen additional benefit .</detailed_description>
