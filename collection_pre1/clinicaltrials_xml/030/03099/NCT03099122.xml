	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To investigate efficacy standard dose Thymoglobuline® induction therapy prevent acute rejection ( AR ) transplantation among recipient Donated Cardiac Death ( DCD ) kidney transplant . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate delay graft function ( DGF ) , graft patient survival kidney transplant . - To evaluate adverse event Thymoglobuline® throughout study . - To explore possible risk factor AR DGF patient DCD kidney transplant . - To evaluate AR DGF different risk stratification explore description optimal induction therapy regimen recipient DCD kidney transplant .</brief_summary>
