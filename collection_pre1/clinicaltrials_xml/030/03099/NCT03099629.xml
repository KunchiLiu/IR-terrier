	<brief_title>Efficacy Inspiratory Muscle Training Respiratory Performance Patients With Esophageal Cancer Receiving Combined Modality Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Purpose : Incidence rate esophageal cancer remain high Eastern Asia . In 2012 , esophageal cancer 9th lead cause cancer death Taiwan . Whether surgical resection possible , combined modality therapy usually require treatment esophageal cancer . In clinical observation , patient underwent combined modality therapy usually demonstrate respiratory muscle dysfunction might impair physical activity quality life . The purpose study investigate effectiveness inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) respiratory performance patient esophageal cancer combine modality therapy . Methods : This prospective interventional study design . A total 45 patient newly diagnose esophageal cancer recruit Mackay Memorial Hospital . All test perform baseline ( prior cancer treatment ) , weekly treatment , prior surgery , one month surgery . Tests include demographic data collection , respiratory muscle performance ( maximal inspiratory expiratory pressure test combine diaphragmatic surface electromyography , pulmonary functional test ) , dyspnea , functional exercise test ( 6-min walk test ) . IMT start intensity 30 % maximal inspiratory pressure , 15 times/set , 3 sets/day , 7 days/week training continue surgery schedule 2 week completion treatment surgery suitable . Repeated measure ANOVA use analyze difference parameter among various time point . Clinical relevance : The result study help good understand clinical beneficial effect ( e.g. , good functional capacity ) add inspiratory muscle training combine modality therapy patient esophageal cancer .</detailed_description>
