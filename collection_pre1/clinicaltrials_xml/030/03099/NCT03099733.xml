	<brief_summary>This prospective study implementation real-time assessment intervention text message tool mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) patient post-discharge emergency department .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concussion Texting Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) important cause morbidity mortality child , result estimate 173,000 emergency department ( ED ) visit 14,000 hospitalization year US . The estimated rate TBI visit increase 57 % 2001-2009 , 2010 2.5 million TBI-related ED visit . Most patient discharge ED diagnose closed head injury , minor head injury , concussion , unspecified head injury . After discharge , patient , family member , care partner may report certain mTBI symptom may lead unnecessary utilization healthcare service . Novel , effective , cost-effective solution mTBI symptom management post ED discharge need improve patient 's understanding symptom discharge . Use mobile technology interact mTBI patient may : 1 ) extend reach clinician , 2 ) offer patient diagnose mTBI form ongoing tailor clinical support , 3 ) contribute improve health outcome optimization health care utilization . Previous research show high compliance text-message base intervention , measurable change behavior , prolong adherence clinical guidance . A recent randomized trial mTBI patient show high-compliance text-message assessment follow ED discharge , trend towards few less severe post-mTBI symptom intervention group . The investigator propose develop pilot novel mobile phone text-messaging platform perform real-time assessment intervention mTBI patient discharge ED . This intervention empower patient actively participate management condition . Use technology mTBI patient population feasible cost-effective . Over 90 % Americans cell phone smartphone , 80 % send receive text-messages . The first objective research study develop pilot novel use exist technology , mobile phone text-messaging , perform real-time assessment feedback regard symptom mTBI patient post-discharge ED . A second objective ass effect brief , real-time , tailor intervention design impact patient caregiver understand mTBI relate symptom . The overarch goal proposal build work Dr. Hirsch , et al . find : 1 ) mTBI patient report poor understanding concussion ; 2 ) mTBI patient report insufficient communication clinician regard symptom follow ED discharge ( e.g. , balance sleep ) ; 3 ) mTBI patient report poor care coordination , poor follow-up , limited access specialist physicians post-discharge . Hypothesis : Based prior work , implementation text-based tool assessment intervention mTBI patient post-discharge CMC-Main &amp; LCH EDs improve patient engagement relate mTBI . It anticipate 50 % potential study subject elect receive text message difference characteristic enrol participant versus non-participants statistically significant . It anticipate &gt; 75 % participant respond/comply symptom assessment message .</detailed_description>
