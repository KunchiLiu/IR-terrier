	<brief_summary>This open-label multi-center trial design evaluate efficacy well safety combine pembrolizumab Yttrium-90 ( Y90 ) radioembolization subject poor prognosis ( high risk ) HCC eligible liver transplant surgical resection well compensate liver function . Treatment consist pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 week conjunction Y90 radioembolization perform one week first dose pembrolizumab . If bilobar disease present , second Y90 radioembolization perform later 4 week first procedure contralateral hepatic lobe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Plus Y90 Radioembolization HCC Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If second Y90 radioembolization treatment require bilobar disease , occur within 4 week initial procedure ( Cycles 2 3 pembrolizumab ) . The next dose pembrolizumab separate Y90 radioembolization least one week . Imaging obtain every 9 week ( every 3 pembrolizumab treatment ) ass tumor response evaluate progression . Subjects remain treatment documented tumor progression , unacceptable toxicity , study withdrawal death . Screening Angiography ( shunt study ) : During screen , subject undergo angiography use technetium-99-labeled macroaggregated albumin detect uptake outside liver via measurement hepatopulmonary shunting . Prior angiography , local anesthetic ( numb area prior catheter insertion ) sedation administer subject , per institutional standard . This procedure standard care subject prior Y90 radioembolization , perform per institutional site standard . Hepatopulmonary shunting must &lt; 20 % subject meet eligibility criterion . Subjects undergo mandatory tumor biopsy day screen angiography . Prior administration first dose pembrolizumab ( i.e. , Day 1 Cycle 1 ) , repeat laboratory test obtain ensure subject still meet eligibility criterion . Pembrolizumab 200mg IV ( IV 30 minute ) every 3 week Day 1 per 21 day cycle ( 3 week ) . Prior administration subsequent pembrolizumab dos , follow criterion must meet : ALT AST : - Among subject baseline ( screen ) ALT/AST &lt; 2×ULN : ALT/AST &lt; 5×ULN - Among subject baseline ( screen ) ALT/AST ≥2×ULN : ALT/AST &lt; 3× baseline level - ALT/AST ≤ 500 U/L regardless baseline level Total bilirubin : - Among subject baseline level &lt; 1.5 mg/dL : value &lt; 2.0 mg/dL - Among subject baseline level ≥ 1.5 mg/dL : value &lt; 2× baseline level - Total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL regardless baseline level Y90 radioembolization perform standard care via institutional standard . To eligible Y90 radioembolization , follow criterion must meet : ALT AST : - Among subject baseline ( screen ) ALT/AST &lt; 2×ULN : ALT/AST &lt; 5×ULN - Among subject baseline ( screen ) ALT/AST ≥ 2×ULN : ALT/AST &lt; 3× baseline level - ALT/AST ≤ 500 U/L regardless baseline level Total bilirubin : - Among subject baseline level &lt; 1.5 mg/dL : value &lt; 2.0 mg/dL - Among subject baseline level ≥ 1.5 mg/dL : value &lt; 2× baseline level - Total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL regardless baseline level In addition , non-hepatic toxicity prior dose ( ) pembrolizumab must resolve Grade ≤ 2 .</detailed_description>
