Caregivers member social network active smoker randomize receive standard smoke cessation strategy ( n=25 triad ) without financial incentive ( n=25 triad ) . SHSe measure directly use salivary cotinine level child home air nicotine level . Caregiver social network member smoking behavior measure nicotine biomarkers ; test result basis incentive payment .
