	<brief_summary>Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) cause blockage leg artery . PAD limit patient ' walk ability quality life . For patient PAD , home exercise program improve walk ability quality life . In many patient population , walk 5,000 step day associate well health . Currently , benefit walk 5,000 step day patient PAD well study . The purpose clinical trial compare two different home exercise program patient PAD : walking least 5,000 step day help fitness monitor vs. walk 45 consecutive minute 3 5 day week ( common exercise prescription PAD ) . This study potential demonstrate , help fitness monitor , walk least 5,000 step day improve walk ability quality life patient PAD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) third lead cause cardiovascular morbidity , follow coronary artery disease stroke . Symptoms PAD include claudication , decrease exercise capacity , progressive functional impairment , decrease quality life . Structured exercise therapy cornerstone treat symptomatic PAD . Guidelines recommend symptom-based exercise program use claudication moderate walking session . Home exercise program demonstrate efficacy improve walk ability quality life symptomatic PAD patient . In general population patient certain chronic disease , walk 5,000 step day associate well health . The efficacy walk 5,000 step day well study symptomatic PAD patient . The EASY FIT Trial single-center prospective randomize control trial compare effectiveness daily step-based exercise program ( walk least 5,000 step day ) vs. guideline-recommended symptom-based exercise program ( walk 45 consecutive minute 3 5 day week ) , improve walk ability quality life patient symptomatic PAD . The study enroll randomize 40 patient symptomatic PAD ( 20 exercise program ) .The result study potential create effective , safe , feasible , sustainable exercise program help PAD patient great walk ability well quality life .</detailed_description>
