	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVE : To determine quality life ( QOL ) clinical outcome conservative therapy , embolization ( proximal versus distal ) surgery patient traumatic splenic injury . Secondary aim : ( I ) examine therapy-related complication , ( II ) establish necessity additional therapy , ( III ) assessment splenic function relate splenic morphology ( MR image ) embolization ( IV ) find prognostic factor failure non-operative management ( NOM ) patient splenic injury . Finally , acquire data study patient-oriented protocol provide management traumatic splenic injury . HYPOTHESIS : The investigator expect NOM superior surgery regard QOL , clinical outcome splenic function . Embolization need additional therapy . Splenic morphology relate splenic immune function . Expected prognostic factor age 40 , ISS &gt; 25 splenic injury grade 3 high . STUDY DESIGN : A combination retrospective prospective multicentre cohort study . This protocol involve prospective part study . STUDY POPULATION/DATASET : Patients enter participate hospital March 2017 July 2018 splenic injury ask participate . The follow-up period one year regard QOL , clinical symptom image . INTERVENTION : All patient complete number questionnaire different time point . The patient treat splenic artery embolization ( SAE ) undergo MRI one month one year treatment . OUTCOME MEASURES : Primary outcome QOL . Secondary outcomes clinical symptom image . SAMPLE SIZE : Approximately 100 patient include per year inclusion phase . DATA ANALYSIS : With regard prospective data linear model perform . COLLABORATION/CONNECTION : Tilburg University , Erasmus medical center Rotterdam , Maasstad hospital Rotterdam , Albert Schweitzer hospital Dordrecht , Amphia hospital Breda . TIME SCHEDULE : Year 1 : literature search conduct retrospective study analysis . Years 1-3 : inclusion prospective study follow-up patient .
