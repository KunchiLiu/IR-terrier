	<brief_summary>Recurrent myocardial infarction ( reinfarctions ) due recurrence original treatment site , presence untreated lesion elsewhere , progressive lesion . There scarce publish data describe localization ( affected vessel/s ) severity ( NSTE-ACS/STE-ACS ) reinfarction ( ) compare index MI ( e.g proportion recurrent infarction previously diseased vessel ) large unselected patient population . If reinfarctions generally severe index MI/recurrent MI ( ) , might implications choice treatment treatment length . Moreover , data unselected patient population overall incidence pattern/rate patient experience multiple reinfarctions sparse . Patients experience multiple ischemic event may subset patient poor responder therapy . There also possibility patient multiple event less likely receive evidence-based therapy coronary stenting , novel effective antithrombotics modern lipid lower treatment initial event . Poor adherence secondary prevention measure ( e.g . low compliance medication adherence cardiac rehabilitation program ) may also increase risk recurrent event . Therefore identification baseline characteristic , include treatment decision strategy set myocardial infarction , among subject may allow modification clinical management strategy prior occurrence subsequent ischemic event . Such modification could include provide intensive additional therapy certain patient group find strategy improve patient adherence drug compliance . A patient reinfarctions require hospitalization , treatment , laboratory test , out-patient visit , result overall increase cost . From patient perspective , recurrent event result high mortality worsen quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study combine SWEDEHEART registries RIKS-HIA ( Registry Information Knowledge Swedish Heart Intensive care Admissions ) , SCAAR ( Swedish Coronary Angiography Angioplasty Registry ) SEPHIA ( registry secondary prevention follow coronary intensive care ) ; Swedish National Population Registry ( obtain data regard vital status date death ) , Swedish Cause Death Register ( separate fatal non-fatal MI ) , Swedish Patient Registry ( obtain data prior medical history ) Swedish Drug Registry ( obtain prescribed medical treatment fill prescription ) . The RIKS-HIA database cover acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) patient treated heart intensive care unit Sweden SCAAR entail PCI procedure perform across center Sweden . In study investigator include patient first time ever NSTE-ACS STE-ACS receive care cardiac intensive care unit enter SWEDEHEART registry 1 July 2006 31 December 2014 . Baseline in-hospital characteristic obtain , include peri-procedural anti-thrombotic treatment . To assess incidence rate fatality reinfarctions contemporary unselected MI cohort To characterize patient one multiple reinfarctions observation period vs. without .
