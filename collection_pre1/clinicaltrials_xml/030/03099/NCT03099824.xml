	<detailed_description>GTO-003 Phase 1 , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , single ascend dose study conduct Australia compare safety pharmacokinetics orally administer GC4711 Intravenously administer GC4419 , assessment food effect . The study conduct healthy adult volunteer , two part . In Part 1 , standard , placebo-controlled , single ascend dose study perform . In Part 2 , conduct contingent result Part 1 , food effect cohort study investigate effect food absorption . Consenting subject undergo screening procedure within 28 day start dose . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ( parent drug major metabolite ) assess plasma urine subject . Part 1 : GC4711 match placebo administer mouth single dose escalate dos start one capsule ( 82 mg ) escalate 5 capsule ( 410 mg ) . The oral GC4711 drug product enteric-coated size 0 Capsugel Vcap Plus hard gel capsule contain GC4711 liquid formulation . It anticipate least 5 dose cohort test depend safety PK outcome , additional serial cohort may add . Subjects cohorts receive single dose oral GC4711 placebo 48 hour single dose IV GC4419 administer 60 minute . For cohort , 8 subject per cohort enrol , randomize 6:2 active GC4711 match placebo . All cohort include sentinel cohort consist two subject , one randomize oral GC4711 one match placebo observe 24 hour safety data review treat investigator dose 6 additional subject full cohort ( 5 active : 1 placebo ) . After cohort , safety PK data review Principal Investigator internal Galera study team proceed next cohort . Depending inter-subject variability oral bioavailability , additional subject may add one dose cohort additional cohort may add . Subjects also undergo electrocardiogram ( ECG ) monitoring select PK time point , include estimate Tmax , ( anticipate 2-4 hour dose GC4711 ) , assess relationship drug exposure GC4419/GC4711 effect QT interval . Part 2 : After completion single-ascending dose portion study , separate cohort subject receive single dose GC4711 ( dose high previously find acceptable safety profile ) , fast fed condition , follow , 7-day washout period , second single dose oral GC4711 , dose , opposite condition ( fed fasting ) . In food effect cohort , subject randomly assign 1:1 fed-fasted sequence ( i.e. , either fed-first fasted-first ) . For fed condition , subject receive standard meal . There placebo dose IV GC4419 dose food effect cohort . Approximately 58 health adult volunteer enrol study : 40 Part 1 18 Part 2 . For cohort , study consist Screening period , Baseline visit Active Phase . The duration individual subject depend assignment study part .</detailed_description>
