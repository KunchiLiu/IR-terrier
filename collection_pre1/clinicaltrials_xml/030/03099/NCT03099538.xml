	<brief_summary>Recently , Interleukin ( IL ) -17 identify key driver chronic inflammation Bullous Pemphigoid ( BP ) . Ixekizumab recombinant high-affinity fully human monoclonal antibody target IL-17A Immunoglobulin gamma-1 ( IgG1 ) /kappa-class . The purpose study determine effect Ixekizumab BP patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BP common auto-immune blistering disease skin cause significant morbidity . BP disproportionally affect elderly population current , non-specific immunosuppressive therapy , addition patient comorbidities , associate high risk infection relate mortality . Neutrophils proteases show play major role cleavage Bullous Pemphigoid 180 Antigen ( BP180 ) BP . Mast cell cellular mediator also contribute pro-inflammatory environment within surround blister BP . However , prior target mast cell basophil result unpredictable disease control . Recently , IL-17 identify key driver chronic inflammation BP . With increase age population United States , BP increase prevalence development target approach necessary decrease morbidity mortality . IL-17 inhibition Ixekizumab may target , disease-modifying effect BP . The primary objective test effect Ixekizumab treatment autoimmune blister disease , BP .</detailed_description>
