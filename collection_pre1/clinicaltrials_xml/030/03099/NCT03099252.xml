	<detailed_description>Background : Newborn infant blood work procedure newborn screen bilirubin test first day life cause pain , distress physiological change . Breastfeeding ( BF ) , skin skin care ( SSC ) , give small amount sweet solution ( sucrose glucose ) without pacifier , effectively safely reduce pain distress newborn infant painful procedure . However , study neonatal pain management practice Ontario throughout Canada demonstrate inconsistent use strategy . There clear need develop test acceptable parent-targeted intervention , alongside health care provider-targeted knowledge translation ( KT ) intervention , support parent ' involvement comfort infant painful procedure . To address knowledge action ( KTA ) gap , Denise Harrison 's Be Sweet Babies team develop BSweet2Babies video , demonstrate effectiveness BF , SSC , sucrose infant bloodwork parent use advocate pain management strategy . Objectives : To evaluate effectiveness parent-targeted mediate KT strategy , BSweet2Babies video , show parent newborn prior newborn screen bilirubin testing , subsequent use three pain reduction strategy blood test . Study design method : This study two-armed cluster RCT enroll hospital Ontario provide Level 1 Level 2 maternal/newborn care contribute data BORN Information System ( BIS ) birth volume least 50 per year . The target sample size 20 hospital involve BIS pain data approximately 15,000 newborn . Following consent , hospital randomize accord plan stratification one two group : intervention group ( show parent BSweet2Babies video prior baby 's newborn screening blood test ) control group ( education information provide ) . Hospitals intervention group show parent 5 minute BSweet2Babies video newborn bloodwork . BIS data subsequently analyze evaluate use BF , SSC sweet solution . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome proportion newborn screen bilirubin test BF , SSC sucrose use . These data systematically collect newborn enter BIS along BORN Ontario maternal newborn data . The secondary outcome number unsatisfactory newborn screening sample , systematically collect BIS . Statistical Analysis : All data analysis primary outcome conduct BORN Ontario data analyst consultation CoI Taljaard . Descriptive statistic use compare characteristic sit birth study arm , include unit type , size hospital , infant sex , parity . Analysis primary outcome perform use marginal logistic regression generalize estimate equation ( GEE ) exchangeable correlation structure account cluster hospital . The identity link function use express effect intervention risk difference scale . Fixed effect model study arm ( control compare intervention ) , type size hospital hospital-level summary measure primary outcome 6 month pre-intervention . All analyse intention-to-treat . Subgroup analyse : To examine intervention differential effect depend : - Type maternal/newborn organization ( Level 1 compare Level 2 ) ; - Sex newborn ; - Parity ( first-born baby compare second subsequent bear baby ) ; - Gestational age birth - Maternal age time birth - Hospital location ( LHIN ) - Hospital volume - Type birth - Maternal hospital length stay - Maternal mental health concern Subgroup analyse perform use interaction term regression model .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criterion hospital include : Hospitals provide Level 1 Level 2 maternal/newborn care contribute data BIS A birth volume least 50 per year Hospitals exclude : Already &gt; 85 % use pain management ( BF , SSC , sucrose ) newborn screen bilirubin sampling , per BIS data These hospital exclude avoid ceiling effect . Have &gt; 50 % miss data pain management data element BIS . The primary outcome study base pain management data BIS thus sit able enter data exclude . Fifty percent data entry data element consider sufficient show site already data entry system already place data element . In addition , two hospital exclude ( Headwaters Health Care Centre St Thomas Elgin General Hospital ) 'model ' Level 1 2 hospital . Our health care representative hospital , Gilmore McCullough , collaboration local interdisciplinary team , advise aspect delivery video unit parent , thus optimize intervention deliver plan ( fidelity intervention ) .</criteria>
