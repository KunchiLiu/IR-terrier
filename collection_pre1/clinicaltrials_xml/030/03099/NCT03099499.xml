	<brief_summary>ONC201 small molecule selectively target G protein-coupled receptor DRD2 . Downstream target engagement , ONC201 activate integrated stress response ( ISR ) tumor cell lead inactivation Akt extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) signal well induction TRAIL pathway . ONC201 also inhibit dopamine receptor 2 ( DRD2 ) , result anti-tumor response preclinical model . Single agent ONC201 examine open-label Phase I study patient advance , treatment refractory solid malignancy . Due differential anti-proliferative pro-apoptotic response tumor cell , treatment overall well tolerate , recommend phase II dose ONC201 set 625mg every three week . An additional dose-escalation phase I study ( NCT02609230 ) evaluate weekly versus three week dose patient advance solid tumor multiple myeloma . Preliminary data phase I study suggest possible clinical benefit patient advance , chemo-refractory endometrial cancer , least one mixed response note patient clear cell histology . Hypothesis : Single agent ONC201 demonstrate clinical benefit woman recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer , especially woman alteration Phosphoinositide 3 kinase ( PI3K ) /Akt/mammalian target Rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway .</brief_summary>
