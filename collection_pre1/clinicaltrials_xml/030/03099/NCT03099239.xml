	<detailed_description>This study phase I , prospective , open-label trial design ass safety one , two , three intravenous dos hCT-MSC young child ASD . Children age two 11 year ASD eligible participate . All participant receive intravenous infusion ( ) CTCs . The first cohort three patient receive single dose . If safety concern , second cohort three patient receive two dos , give two month apart . The third cohort consist six patient , receive three hCT-MSC infusion two-month interval dos . All participant initial clinical evaluation verify diagnosis ASD confirm protocol eligibility . The main endpoint safety , acute infusion reaction incidence infection assess .
