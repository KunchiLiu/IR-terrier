	<brief_summary>Each year , million Americans admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) . For half , ICU admission initiate cascade decision treatment end-of-life care.This particularly case patient chronic critical illness , life-limiting syndrome . Most ( 74 % -82 % ) ICU patient require mechanical ventilation transient persistent cognitive impairment precludes make healthcare decision . Among ICU patient , chronically critically ill ( CCI ) high risk cognitive impairment thus require surrogate decision maker ( SDM ) , usually family member . SDMs critically ill often describe high state psychological stress associate uncertainty patient 's condition decision make role . The purpose study test effectiveness two decision support intervention end-of-life care deliver SDMs CCI patient . This first study test intervention tailor unique need SDMs CCI patient deliver use interactive avatar base format .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decision Support Among Surrogate Decision Makers Chronically Critically Ill ( INVOLVE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct three-arm unblinded clinical trial use pre- post-tests evaluate efficacy two electronic decision-support intervention , Interactive Virtual Decision Support End-of-Life Palliative Care ( INVOLVE ) Informational Support ( IS ) , compare usual care ( UC ) among 270 SDMs cognitively impair CCI patient . This design allow investigator prospectively compare efficacy experiential avatar-based decision support tool ( INVOLVE ) information-only condition UC . Subjects assign experimental condition ( INVOLVE IS ) receive two dos intervention , enrollment 1 day later . After second dose , subject access assign condition subsequent self-administered dos , electronically capture patient 's ICU discharge death . Data collect ( T1 ) baseline ( Day 3 4 patient 's ICU stay ) , Days 1 , 3 , 7 90 post-baseline The investigator aim : 1 . Identify essential element graphical user interface educational content need revise INVOLVE prototype set common end-of-life decision occur ICU . 2 . Evaluate difference decision make readiness decision make quality subject expose INVOLVE , IS , UC Days 1 , 3 , 7 day post-baseline accounting covariates ( prior SDM experience , SDM knowledge patient 's preference , SDM 's religious belief ) . 3 . Determine difference post-decision outcome SDMs CCI patient study condition accounting covariates 90 day post-baseline .</detailed_description>
