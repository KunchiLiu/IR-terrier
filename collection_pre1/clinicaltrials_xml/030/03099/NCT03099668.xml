	<detailed_description>Hypotheses 1 . Holistic review multidisciplinary team lead improve outcome improved disease activity , physical function quality life ( QOL ) patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . 2 . These improve outcome likely mediate via improvement medication adherence , cop , disease specific knowledge improve self-efficacy . 3 . A `` One Stop Arthritis Clinic '' ( OSAC ) patient see multidisciplinary team co-located time space , effective solution deliver multidisciplinary care . Specific aim Primary : To determine whether multidisciplinary review , compare routine review treat rheumatologist , lead improved QOL measure European Quality Life-5 Dimension 3 Level ( EQ-5D ) index 6 month patient RA deem stable disease activity . Secondary : 1 . To examine effect multidisciplinary review , compare routine rheumatologist review RA disease activity ( measure use disease activity score 28 joint , DAS28 ) , pain ( measure use 100mm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , physical function ( measure use modify Health Assessment Questionnaire , mHAQ ) . 2 . To examine effect multidisciplinary review , compare routine rheumatologist review several secondary measure include self-efficacy ( measure use Rheumatoid Arthritis Self Efficacy , RASE ) , Disease Specific Knowledge ( DSK ) use Patient Knowledge Questionnaire ( PKC ) , cop medication adherence ( use MARS questionnaire , pill count adherence proportion percentage ) 3 . To examine effect multidisciplinary review , compare routine rheumatologist review patient experience Background Significance Burden disease : Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic disease affect approximately 0.5 -0.7 % population ; common working-age adult . Inadequately treated RA lead cause disability , work loss productivity loss due irreversible joint damage relatively young group population , prime productive work-life . `` Treat Target '' ( T2T ) approach : It clearly show , T2T approach , therapy escalate regular interval accord pre-determined protocol drive consistent measurement disease activity , superior routine care achieve remission , T2T standard care . A validated , clinically sensitive composite disease activity measure , DAS28 routinely use measure disease activity , good predictor disability . DAS28 value &lt; 2.6 define remission . About 50 % patient early RA treat NUH rheumatology clinic achieve remission 6 month ( unpublished data , Singapore Early Arthritis Cohort ) . Multidisciplinary care : The multidisciplinary team ( MDT ) concept increasingly gain popularity traction , show improve outcome complex cancer care . Several rheumatology society quality standard recommend patient RA access multidisciplinary team consist , minimum , specialist nurse , physiotherapist ( PT ) , occupational therapist ( OT ) podiatrist . This base result several randomize controlled trial show benefit occupational therapy grip strength , physiotherapy physical function cardiovascular fitness RA . The multidisciplinary `` One Stop Arthritis Clinic '' ( OSAC ) National University Hospital ( NUH ) , Singapore . An OSAC set specialist outpatient clinic ( SOC ) National University Hospital ( NUH ) January 2016 aim provide point care access MDT care . Prior OSAC , MDT care RA patient sporadic , . Most patient treat solely physician ( rheumatologist ) , referral member MDT `` need '' basis , appointment make different day , different location . Many patient decline appointment due inconvenience separate visit often perceive unnecessary . The OSAC team currently consist 6 member , namely rheumatologist , specialist nurse , PT , OT , podiatrist medical social worker . Existing RA patient follow NUH may refer , discretion rheumatologist , OSAC . Consenting patient see OSAC next review , lieu routine rheumatologist review . Preliminary patient survey report excellent patient experience . As previously report , per experience , early success come careful plan logistics organization clinic , along full equal participation stake-holders share egalitarian value , thus avoid conflict . However , barrier OSAC referral , namely : ( ) Cost : As outpatient specialist consultation Singapore typically pay pocket , vary amount government subsidization , patient pay anywhere twice 3 time consultation fee attend OSAC compare routine rheumatologist review . Therefore , cost patient play major role health care decision . ( ii ) Poor uptake part patient : A survey among patient reveal poor general awareness ally health service . This possibly Asian culture traditionally tend adopt doctor-centred care delivery , especially old patient experience doctor-led consultation life . Gaps knowledge : . Although individual benefit OT PT intervention clearly show , mostly limited intensive regimen involve multiple session close supervision.17-20 The recommend `` annual MDT review '' never show control trial improve outcome . The recommendation annual MDT review base mainly observational study expert opinion . ii . Most trial OT PT perform prior treat target ( T2T ) era . It remain see , whether current effective treatment , MDT review confer additive benefit . Our study aim fill gap randomly assign patient either OSAC routine rheumatologist care , comprehensively study outcomes group . Methods Study design : Single centre , randomise , single-blind , controlled trial . Recruitment : Patients recruit rheumatology outpatient clinic NUH , inform consent take patient agreeable participate . Consented patient randomise via random number sequence generate Stata® statistical software place seal envelope . Study visit : The study visit 0 , 3 6 month , time coincide routine rheumatology clinic visit . The baseline visit approximately 3 month randomisation visit . Patients randomise intervention arm see OSAC , follow visit routine rheumatology clinic month 3 6 . Patients control arm see routine rheumatology clinic visit ( 0 , 3 6 month ) . Data collection follow-up : Patients follow 6 month baseline visit ( approximately 9 month randomisation ) . Data collect self-administered questionnaire face face interview administer trained research nurse intervention control arm blood draw potential future research participant baseline visit . Data demographic , disease severity ( seropositivity , presence erosion ) disease activity use DAS28 collect use standard case report form ( CRF ) baseline 6 month . Joint count perform either ML , PC , AS research nurse baseline visit . At 3 month 6-month visit , joint count perform independent assessor ( second research nurse ) , blind study arm . A standardisation session conduct improve inter-rater reliability various joint count assessor prior commencement study . Physical function assess accord mHAQ HR-QOL measure use EQ-5D instrument baseline 6 month . Pain score , self-efficacy , cop , adherence disease specific knowledge measure baseline , 3 month 6 month use VAS pain , RASE , cop , MARS Hennel patient knowledge questionnaire ( PKC ) respectively foot pain measure use Manchester Foot Disability Index ( MFI ) . In addition , data comorbidities , exercise frequency , smoking , alcohol , traditional medication use , vaccination status adherence recommend cancer screening collect . Laboratory test image do part routine clinical care patient RA relevant data abstract electronic medical record . Treatment change visit record . Resource utilisation form number clinic visit ( include separate visit see allied healthcare professional ) , laboratory test , imaging , prescription procedure abstract hospital billing database . Utilisation specialist nurse helpline record . Work status number day work patient caregiver ( ) also collect . Data patient experience abstract hospital electronic patient experience survey , administer patient baseline visit . Primary outcome measure : European Quality Life-5 Dimension 3 Level ( EQ-5D ) index 6 month Secondary outcome measure : . Proportion patient clinical remission low RA disease activity ( measure use disease activity score 28 joint , DAS28 ) ( remission = DAS28 ≤ 2.6 , low disease activity = DAS28 &gt; 2.6 &amp; ≤ 3.2 ) ii . Pain ( measure use 100mm visual analogue ( VAS ) scale iii . Physical function ( measure use modify Health Assessment Questionnaire , mHAQ ) . iv . Self-efficacy ( measure use Rheumatoid Arthritis Self Efficacy , RASE ) v. Disease Specific Knowledge ( DSK ) use Patient Knowledge Questionnaire ( PKC ) vi . Coping vii . Medication adherence ( use MARS questionnaire pill count calculate medication adherence proportion percentage ) viii . Patient experience ( use standard hospital electronic patient experience survey , e-PES ) ix . Foot pain ( use Manchester foot disability index , MFI ) x . Proportion patient achieve adherence guideline vaccination xi . Proportion patient achieve adherence guideline cardiovascular risk management xii . Proportion patient achieve adherence guideline bone health optimisation xiii . Proportion patient achieve adherence guideline cancer screen xiv . Utilisation healthcare resource ( clinic visit , laboratory , image , procedure , prescription , call nurse helpline ) xv . Days work ( patient ) xvi . Days work ( caregiver ) xvii . Hours per week productive pay unpaid work ( patient ) xviii . Hours per week productive pay unpaid work ( caregiver ) Sample size calculation feasibility : Using baseline value patient see OSAC , mean baseline EQ-5D index ( descriptive ) 0.722 standard deviation ( SD ) 0.156 . Allowing alpha error 5 % , 95 % power demonstrate minimal clinically important improvement 0.1 EQ-5D index , would need sample size 128 1:1 randomisation ( 64 arm ) . After allow 10 % dropout rate , plan recruit 140 patient ( 70 arm ) study . Approximately 60 patient RA see weekly NUH . The OSAC run week capacity 6 patient per clinic session . If randomize 8 patient per week ( half would randomize intervention arm , see OSAC ) , would able recruit adequate number subject 18 week . The consultation fee study participant ' baseline visit ( OSAC routine rheumatology review ) would pay grant funding ; thus provide incentive patient participate , also overcome cost barrier referral OSAC . Follow patient would complete 9 month last patient recruit ; thus study complete 14 month . Statistical analysis : All analysis do use Stata® statistical software . The mean EQ-5D index 6 month patient intervention control group compare use Student 's t-test . Logistic regression use calculate odds achieve minimal clinically important difference QOL ( measure 0.1 increase EQ-5D index ) intervention vs. control group control confounders age , gender , disease duration , disease severity ( seropositivity , presence erosion baseline ) , disease activity ( DAS28 ) mHAQ baseline . We determine whether self-efficacy , cop , adherence DSK improve prediction QOL add regression model . Strengths limitation This randomize control study , thus control bias term allocation patient MDT care . Disease activity outcomes blind ; joint count perform blind assessor . The case report form design comprehensive , possible outcome importance collect . Though cost-effectiveness one outcomes study , data collect adequate cost -effectiveness analysis necessary . The main limitation study patient blind intervention ( MDT care ) . This inherent nature intervention . In addition , outcome assessor blind several outcome , determine patient report questionnaire ; thus may bias favour MDT care . Radiographic outcome term joint space narrow erosion collect part study , typically change need time ( ≥ 1 year ) relatively insensitive subtle intervention . However , increasingly outcomes important patient think prefer outcome study , show predictive radiographic damage .</detailed_description>
