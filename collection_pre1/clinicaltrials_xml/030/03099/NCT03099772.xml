	<brief_summary>Generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) condition characterize chronic excessive worry anxiety . Over past 15 year , investigator develop cognitive-behavioural treatment lead remission GAD approximately 60 % 75 % affected individual . Although number encourage , remain considerable proportion patient fully benefit treatment . With goal improve treatment efficacy , investigator recently carry series relate study way individual GAD high worrier process uncertain ambiguous information environment . The finding show individual display bias attention , appraisal , uncertain ambiguous information . Specifically , individual GAD high worrier preferentially allocate attention uncertainty-related stimulus appraise ambiguous information threaten manner . In study , investigator examine impact information processing bias , measure intake , efficacy cognitive-behavioural treatment GAD . The investigator also examine impact residual information processing bias , measure posttreatment , maintenance treatment gain 18 month follow treatment . The main hypothesis ( 1 ) high level pretreatment bias predict poor outcome immediately follow therapy , ( 2 ) high level posttreatment bias predict relapse 18 month follow therapy . If , expect , information processing bias predict poor short- long-term treatment outcome individual GAD , investigator expand treatment integrate strategy directly target bias order increase efficacy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CBT GAD : Impact Cognitive Processing Treatment Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The investigator develop cognitive model generalize anxiety disorder ( GAD ) intolerance uncertainty central component . Based model , devise cognitive-behavioural treatment ( CBT ) GAD help affect individual recognize , accept , deal uncertainty everyday life . Although treatment lead positive outcome patient , significant minority treat individual attain full remission . One potential avenue improve treatment GAD identify disorder-specific mode cognitive processing ( information processing ) directly target mode process therapy . Accordingly , investigator carry series relate study examine relationship cognitive processing GAD . The finding study show individual clinical subclinical GAD ( 1 ) preferentially allocate attention uncertainty-related stimulus , ( 2 ) make threatening appraisal ambiguous information . Further , data show tendency make threatening appraisal ambiguous information mediates relationship intolerance uncertainty symptom GAD . This latter find consistent cognitive theory , assert information processing mediate influence cognitive vulnerability expression symptom emotional disorder . This study aim extend line research investigate impact cognitive processing bias treatment outcome patient GAD . Goals hypothesis : The main goal study examine impact bias cognitive process short- long-term outcome cognitive-behavioural therapy individual GAD . The study 's main hypothesis : ( 1 ) preferential allocation attention uncertainty-related stimulus , assess pretreatment , predict poor response treatment ; ( 2 ) tendency appraise ambiguous information threaten manner , assessed pretreatment , predict poor response treatment ; ( 3 ) preferential allocation attention uncertainty-related stimulus , assess posttreatment , predict relapse follow-up ; ( 4 ) tendency appraise ambiguous information threaten manner , assessed posttreatment , predict relapse follow-up . Method : The final sample consist 80 adult patient principal diagnosis GAD , recruit Anxiety Disorders Clinic Sacré-Cœur Hospital Montreal . Participants assess 9 measurement time : pretreatment , midtreatment , posttreatment , 3- , 6- , 9- , 12- , 15- 18-month follow-up . Assessments include Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule DSM-IV , cognitive processing task ( Ambiguous/Unambiguous Situations Diary ) , battery standardized self-report measure . Treatment consist empirically support CBT protocol GAD , administer 16 weekly session use session-by-session treatment manual develop early study . Growth curve analysis multilevel model main analytic strategy use determine relationship cognitive processing change range outcome variable control relevant clinical sociodemographic variable . Implications : The study important theoretical clinical implication . In term theory , begin bridge gap considerable knowledge role cognitive processing anxiety lack knowledge impact cognitive processing treatment outcomes . Surprisingly , although role cognitive processing anxiety intensely study , impact cognitive processing GAD psychotherapy outcomes never examine . The propose study also inform clinical practice importance ( 1 ) systematically assess cognitive processing , ( 2 ) integrate treatment intervention specifically target biased cognitive processing current GAD treatment protocol .</detailed_description>
