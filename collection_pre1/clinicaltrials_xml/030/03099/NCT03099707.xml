	<brief_title>The Treatment Ambassador Program : A Pilot Intervention Increase Treatment Initiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Global HIV treatment initiative focus increase access antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , goal create `` AIDS-free generation . '' There grow evidence , however , treatment availability alone insufficient stop spread disease . Countries HIV hyperendemic , South Africa , achieve population-level reduction HIV incident infection dramatically reduce lifetime , people live HIV ( PLWH ) long wait start treatment symptom advance AIDS . As South Africa expand ART eligibility people live HIV , remain unclear promote earlier ART initiation lead widespread uptake . These operational reality raise two fundamental question : close gap 3.4 million PLWH currently ART treat seven million people need care ; portend future Treatment Prevention South Africa ? The investigator ' prior research suggest optimize ART initiation PLWH South Africa require intervention reduce individual barrier start ART , promote social support , enhance linkage healthcare system . In proposed study , investigator build upon prior research pilot test socio-behavioral multi-component peer intervention , ensure South Africans live HIV initiate sustain treatment . Investigators test intervention pilot randomized-controlled trial . This multi-component intervention design address barrier ART initiation identify prior qualitative research , frame Theory Triadic Influence ( TTI ) . TTI focus upon three `` streams influence '' impact health behavior individual- , social- , structural-levels . The intervention deliver `` Treatment Ambassadors , '' PLWH function multiple capacity , receive intensive train motivational interviewing ( MI ) , peer-support , peer navigation . They provide intervention eight session 8-14 week . The intervention individually tailor address three streams influence patient decision-making follow : MI address individual perceive risk ambivalence decision-making ; peer-support target interpersonal social factor ; patient navigation promote ART initiation counter structural barrier . Investigators enroll 90 participant ( 45 arm ) goal assess feasibility acceptability . In addition , preliminary efficacy assess follow measure : Primary Outcome Measure : Timely ART initiation ( initiation within 3 month enrollment ) ( assessed National Health Laboratory Service , pharmacy record , medical chart abstraction ) . Secondary Outcomes Measures : 1 ) HIV-1 RNA Suppression within first year study enrollment ( assessed National Health Laboratory Service ) . 2 ) Behavioral Factors associate failure initiate ART timely manner .</detailed_description>
