	<brief_summary>Surgical resection potentially curative treatment patient pancreatic cancer . Patients BRPC tumor close contact vasculature extent resection prohibit . Nonetheless , retrospective study show immediate resection patient associate increased risk positive margin , margin positive resection improve survival patient unresectable disease . Moreover , even patient successful resection achieve , high rate early metastatic progression suggest micrometastatic disease often present diagnosis . Therefore neoadjuvant therapy likely improve outcome patient BRPC increase likelihood achieve margin negative resection , provide early control occult micrometastatic disease , select patient without systemic progression would benefit surgical resection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Modified FOLFIRINOX Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given superior outcome FOLFIRINOX potential improve local response SBRT , investigator propose evaluate efficacy pre-operative modify FOLFIRINOX follow SBRT patient borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma . The investigator hypothesize pre-operative modify FOLFIRINOX follow SBRT improve rate R0 resection compare historical control treat standard gemcitabine-based chemotherapy fractionate radiation prior surgery .</detailed_description>
