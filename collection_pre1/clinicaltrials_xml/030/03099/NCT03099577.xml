	<brief_title>PET/CT-directed Hyperfractionated Radiation Dose Escalation Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Concurrent chemoradiotherapy standard care unresectable stage III NSCLC base result phase III randomise trial . The current standard radiation therapy dose remain 60- Gy -2 Gy/fraction nearly four decade ( 60Gy ) , local disease control rate approximately 50 % median overall survival 18 months.These result suboptimal effective treatment regimen need . We hypothesize hyperfractionated radiation dose escalation residual tumor volume standard chemoradiotherapy define positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) would improve local control overall survival reduce acute late normal tissue toxicity .</detailed_description>
