	<brief_title>Exploratory Trial Evaluating Cosentyx ( Secukinumab ) Patients With Moderate-to-Severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secukinumab antibody inhibit Interleukin-17A , IL-17 promote neutrophil activity . Neutrophils find large number HS . The expression inflammatory cytokine IL-17 , IL-1β , TNF-α enhance lesional skin HS patient . Prior study demonstrate improvement HS biologic medication tumor necrosis factor inhibitor adalimumab infliximab . Studies show conflict data regard efficacy etanercept HS success anakinra . This initial pilot study secukinumab purpose studying may alter HS disease symptom . This study intend alter indication drug use may inform design efficacy study may alter FDA label change future . There limitation study arise single-arm clinical trial small number subject . These limitation include limited generalizability knowledge study due lack active comparator . However , data obtain study potentially use support design large future randomize placebo control study .</detailed_description>
