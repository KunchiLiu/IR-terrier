	<brief_summary>In France , Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) affect 1 450 birth . It result lesion brain , , , shortly birth . These non-progressive lesion cause muscle impairment , responsible activity limitation . These muscle impairment include muscle stiffness , muscle weakness . Children Unilateral CP ( UCP ) impairments one side body . To compensate activity limitation impair arm , child over-use non-impaired arm . The objective constraint-induced therapy ( CIT ) minimize asymmetry deteriorates mobility impaired side , force child use impaired arm several hour day several week therapy . It know use clinical test therapy improve overall motor function impair arm . However , underlie mechanism yet unknown . An understanding mechanism would suggest way maximize effectiveness therapy , require significant commitment child family . The investigaors propose project quantitative objective evaluation effect CIT movement impair arm child UCP . The investogators focus analysis muscle activation , assess aspect muscle impairment modify CIT . To end , investigator use sensor identical already use clinic Quantified Gait Analysis child CP , recognize since 2006 Haute Autorité de Santé provide key supplementary data evaluation complex gait disorder . Results study provide lead optimize CIT . Some child could example benefit CIT paired treatment reduce muscle stiffness strengthen muscle</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensitivity Upper Limb Motion Analysis Protocol Changes Kinematics Muscle Activity After Constraint Induced Therapy Children With Hemiplegia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Quantitative objective evaluation upper limb movement take place motion analysis laboratory take place follow : - A clinical exam participant perform physician collect maximal passive joint amplitude goniometer anatomical measure ( length , circumference ) upper limb . - The participant equip surface electromyographic electrode measure activation superficial muscle , retroreflective marker place anatomical landmark thorax , shoulder , arm , measure upper limb kinematics 3D motion capture system compose 8 VICON camera . - Maximal force elbow pronosupination flexion-extension measure portable dynamometer . - The participant place height adjustable bench , center laboratory . He ask perform upper limb movement : - A movement measure , familiarize equipment ; - Recorded movement : trial compose consecutive cycle movement elbow flexion-extension . A trial usually last 10seconds . A seconds-time rest impose trial . The required movement follow : elbow flexion-extension , elbow pronosupination , `` hand mouth '' . - Finally , participant ask lie exam table rest relax , order measure electromyographic signal muscle rest . Duration protocol 1h30 , less 30seconds effort , minute perform simple upper limb movement .</detailed_description>
