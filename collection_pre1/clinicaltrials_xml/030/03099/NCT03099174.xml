	<brief_summary>For dose finding cohort ( A , B , C D ) : The primary objective dose find cohort determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) / recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) xentuzumab combination abemaciclib without hormonal therapy ( letrozole , anastrozole , fulvestrant ) . Dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) assess first treatment cycle ass MTD/RP2D . In case MTD reach RP2D dose determine take account safety data available information . This agree Steering Committee . For expansion cohort ( E F ) : The objective expansion cohort ass anti-tumour activity xentuzumab combination abemaciclib patient non-small cell lung cancer ( cohort E ) . Tentatively cohort F may open assess anti-tumour activity triplet combination xentuzumab / abemaciclib fulvestrant single-arm expansion group patient locally advance / metastatic hormone receptor positive ( HR+ ) breast cancer progress follow prior aromatase inhibitor therapy prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment . Cohort F open indicated emerge data ongoing clinical trial .</brief_summary>
