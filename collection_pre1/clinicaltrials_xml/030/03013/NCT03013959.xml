	<brief_summary>As report , NSAIDs ( pranoprofen , bromfenac ) eye drop suppress herpes simplex virus（HSV-1） reactivation reduce inflammatory reaction vitro vivo . In Clinical , risk corneal tissue melting , glaucoma , cataract topical application NSAIDs . To explore effective clinical treatment viral keratitis patient control inflammatory damage , save visual function reduce recurrence virus , observe effect anti-inflammatory inhibition recurrence herpes simplex virus topical NSAIDs administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Viral keratitis become high incidence severe-caused blindness corneal disease worldwide , superior bacterial keratitis fungal keratitis . At present , clinical treatment mainly depend local systematic use antiviral drug viral keratitis , inhibit replication virus corneal tissue directly damage viral action . However , basal study viral keratitis suggest pathological immune injury produce body also play important role formation corneal ulcer , damage visual function patient , necrotic stromal inflammation phase , endotheliitis phase even serious combination iridocyclitis phase viral keratitis . There , however , large controversy hormone therapy disease clearly cause pathological immune injury medical world . Patients infectious keratitis cause viral infection , receive hormone treatment , may cause viral replication enhance control , hormone could also cause spontaneous corneal tissue fusion ; hence , treatment combine hormone certain risk . In clinical treatment , permanent corneal opacity cause corneal inflammation response cause patient permanent visual acuity loss , patient ' corneal lesion control simple use antiviral drug . Another important reason high incidence blindness cause viral keratitis : herpesvirus , herpes simplex virus herpes zoster virus , involve trigeminal ganglion hide primary infection , repeatedly recur stimulation excessive drinking , menstruation , take cold operation etc.. Viral keratitis often cause patient severe visual impairment initial onset . But , viruses patient herpes simplex virus keratitis show extremely high recurrence rate . As suggested epidemiologic study Euro-American country , recurrence rate could 30 % first year , 46 % second year . In case , transparent corneal tissue develop nephelium even macular nebula opacity repeat recur , patient eventually lose visual acuity , become people blindness disability . Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug , pranoprofen bromfenac sodium , show significant inhibition virus recurrence relief corneal inflammation response experiment vitro animal experiment , indicate previous study . In clinical , local application nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug result spontaneous corneal tissue fusion , drug-induced glaucoma , drug-induced cataract risk . In order seek effective clinical treatment viral keratitis patient term control inflammation injury , preserve visual function reduce virus recurrence , study observe pranoprofen , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug , inhibit pathological immune injury viral keratitis prevents disease recurring , accord basal research background viral keratitis .</detailed_description>
