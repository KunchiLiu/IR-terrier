	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose brentuximab vedotin cyclosporine give together verapamil treat patient Hodgkin lymphoma come back respond treatment . Monoclonal antibody , brentuximab vedotin , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Immunosuppressive therapy , cyclosporine , may improve bone marrow function increase blood cell count . Verapamil may increase effectiveness brentuximab vedotin overcome drug resistance cancer cell . Giving brentuximab vedotin , cyclosporine , verapamil may work well treat patient Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin , Cyclosporine , Verapamil Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety tolerability combination brentuximab vedotin ( BV ) plus MDR1 inhibitor cyclosporine ( CsA ) /verapamil ( VRP ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Obtain estimate overall response rate ( ORR ) , complete response ( CR ) rate , response duration patient treat combination BV plus CsA/VRP . II . Estimate overall progression-free survival patient treat combination BV plus CsA/VRP . III . Characterize pharmacokinetics plasma MMAE cycle 1 ( expansion cohort ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study brentuximab vedotin cyclosporine . Patients receive cyclosporine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-10 , verapamil PO four time daily ( QID ) day 1-10 , brentuximab vedotin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
