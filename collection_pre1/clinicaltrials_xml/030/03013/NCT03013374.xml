	<detailed_description>Nutritional management preterm infant aim approximate tissue growth body composition foetus postconceptional age . The adequacy quality protein supply could influence rate relative composition weight gain . Aim study investigate protein balance accord feed regimen association exclusive human milk feed fat free mass content term correct age cohort low birth weight infant . A prospective observational study . Infants include accord inclusion criterion . Enrollment perform hospital discharge . Infants divide two group ( exclusively human milk exclusively formula ) accord mother 's milk availability . At enrollment macronutrients ' intake protein balance determine . Anthropometric measurement body composition also assess . Nutritional composition human milk calculate infrared spectroscopy ( MIRIS® AB , Uppsala , Sweden ) . Protein balance determine accord nitrogen balance standard method . Body composition assess air-displacement plethysmography system system ( PEA POD Infant Body Composition System , COSMED SRL , Roma , Italy ) . At term correct age anthropometry body composition assessment repeat .</detailed_description>
