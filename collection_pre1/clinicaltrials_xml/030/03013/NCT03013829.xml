	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness target educational approach design increase knowledge risk benefit live donation generally KPD ( Kidney Paired Donation ) specifically , enhance KPD self-efficacy , reduce KPD concern , facilitate inform decision make KPD among incompatible cross-match positive donor-recipient pair .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Kidney Paired Donation Video-Based Education Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) examine effectiveness video-based KPD education intervention improve knowledge , self-efficacy , concern , inform decision-making KPD incompatible potential living kidney donor ( LKDs ) intend transplant recipient . There equal allocation LKDs intend recipient KPD education condition : ( 1 ) Usual Care ( UC ) group ( 2 ) UC plus video-based KPD education group . All enrol LKDs intend recipient complete baseline survey another survey 2 week post-intervention . Additionally , follow-up data gather KPD decision-making , participation , reason non-participation 3 month post-intervention . Settings target population . The study conduct two kidney transplant program United States : Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ; Boston , MA ) Medical University South Carolina ( MUSC ; Charleston , SC ) . This study target potential LKDs intend recipient whose histocompatibility test determine incompatible . Randomization . Random assignment education group occur immediately follow completion baseline survey . Randomization do LKD , randomize group match intend recipient . The randomized group LKD-recipient pair reduce risk contamination , critical threat internal validity type study . For instance , LKD assign KPD video-based education group intend recipient assign UC ( Usual Care ) group , real possibility would diffusion treatment LKD discuss element intervention recipient , turn , may influence recipient 's living donation KPD knowledge , concern , decision-making process . A simple unrestricted random allocation sequence use . REDCap use generate randomization sequence , accessible site coordinator transplant educator . The PI Co-Investigators blind subject ' allocation assignment . Interventions . Usual Care ( UC ) Living Donation KPD Education . Incompatible potential LKDs recipient receive live donation KPD-specific education usually BIDMC MUSC kidney transplant program . As noted previously , potential LKDs inform incompatibility phone call donor nurse coordinator . At time , KPD option describe potential LKD provide live donation information link UNOS ( United Network Organ Sharing ) KPD website ( https : //www.unos.org/donation/kidney-paired-donation/ ) , include write description KPD . This information available English Spanish . For internet access , write educational material mail . The potential LKD advise call donor nurse coordinator question KPD and/or initiate full donation evaluation . An identical KPD educational process occur intend recipient , although do transplant nurse coordinator potential donor decides initiate full donation evaluation . Incompatible LKDs recipient assign UC group send email randomization , include reminder visit UNOS website link provide email . Video-Based KPD Education . Incompatible LKDs recipient assign video-based KPD education group receive live donation KPD educational material UC group . Also , UC group , encourage site coordinator review educational material . In addition , follow randomization group , participant send email encouraging watch embed KPD education video . This video professionally design highlight operational feature KPD address specific barrier highlight formative research . The primary goal session increase live donation KPD knowledge risk benefit reduce specific concern base inaccurate information . The intent persuade LKDs recipient pursue live donation KPD , ensure sufficient information make informed choice consistent value preference . Assessment Time-points . Study data collect participant three different time point . Baseline . Participants complete 30-minute online assessment via REDCap follow email consent prior randomization . The questionnaire assessment gather sociodemographic information , ass primary secondary outcome , measure important covariates . Post-Intervention . Two week randomization , participant complete 20-minute REDCap assessment primary secondary outcome , uptake write video educational element , discussion others live donation KPD , educational intervention process evaluation , step take pursue donation evaluation . The rationale timing assessment re-assess primary secondary outcome close proximity delivery live donation KPD-specific education yet provide sufficient time participant assimilate consider information acquire . Follow-up . Three month follow live donation KPD-specific education , participant complete brief REDCap assessment learn final decision regard living donation factor contribute . The rationale timing follow-up assessment vast majority incompatible potential LKDs recipient offer KPD achieve final disposition within time period .</detailed_description>
