	<criteria>1 . Rare genetic disease patient genetically confirm diagnosis ( may confirm test Screening ) : 1 . Homozygous compound heterozygous ( different gene mutation allele ) LepR mutation 2 . Heterozygous POMC ( +/ ) mutation 3 . POMC hypermethylation ( epigenetic ) variant ( &gt; 51.92 % POMC methylation intensity specific analyze POMC region ) 4 . BardetBiedl Syndrome 5 . Alström Syndrome 2 . Age 12 year . 3 . If adult age ≥18 year , obesity body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 30 kg/m2 ; adolescent , obesity weight &gt; 97th percentile age growth chart assessment . 4 . Study participant and/or parent guardian able communicate well investigator , understand comply requirement study , able understand sign write informed consent/assent . 5 . Female participant childbearing potential must confirm nonpregnant , agree use contraception outline protocol . Female participant nonchildbearing potential , define surgically sterile ( status post hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral tubal ligation ) , postmenopausal least 12 month ( confirm screen FSH level postmenopausal lab range ) , failure progress Tanner Stage V and/or failure achieve menarche , require contraception study . 6 . Male participant female partner childbearing potential must agree double barrier method become sexually active study . Male patient must donate sperm 90 day follow participation study . 1 . Recent intensive ( within 2 month ) diet and/or exercise regimen without use weight loss agent include herbal medication , result weight loss . Patients may reconsider approximately 1 month cessation intensive regimen . 2 . Recent ( within 1 month ) participation another clinical trial would confound result study . 3 . Prior gastric bypass surgery result &gt; 10 % weight loss durably maintain baseline preoperative weight evidence weight regain . Specifically , patient may consider surgery successful , result &lt; 10 % weight loss compare preoperative baseline weight clear evidence weight regain initial response bariatric surgery . All patient history bariatric surgery must discuss , receive approval Rhythm prior enrollment . 4 . Diagnosis schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , personality disorder Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSMIII ) disorder investigator believe interfere significantly study compliance . Neurocognitive disorder affect ability consent disqualify long appropriate guardian able give consent appoint . 5 . A Patient Health Questionnaire9 ( PHQ9 ) score ≥ 15 , subject significant neurocognitive deficit . 6 . Any suicidal ideation type 4 5 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( CSSRS ) . Any lifetime history suicide attempt , suicidal behavior last month , patient without evidence significant neurocognitive impairment . 7 . Current , clinically significant pulmonary , cardiac , oncologic disease , severe enough interfere study and/or would confound result . Any patient discuss sponsor prior inclusion . 8 . History significant liver disease liver injury , current liver assessment cause abnormal liver test [ indicate abnormal liver function test , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , alkaline phosphatase , serum bilirubin ( &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) test ) ] etiology nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . Thus , underlie etiology besides NAFLD , include diagnose nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , cause hepatitis , history hepatic cirrhosis exclusionary , presence NAFLD would exclusionary . 9 . History presence impair renal function indicate clinically significant abnormal creatinine , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , urinary constituent ( e.g. , albuminuria ) moderate severe renal dysfunction define Cockroft Gault equation &lt; 30 mL/min . 10 . History close family history ( parent sibling ) skin cancer melanoma , patient history ocularcutaneous albinism . 11 . Significant dermatologic finding relate melanoma premelanoma skin lesion , determine part screen comprehensive skin evaluation perform qualified dermatologist . Any concern lesion identify screening period biopsied result know benign prior enrollment . If pretreatment biopsy result concern , patient may need exclude study . 12 . Volunteer , opinion Study Investigator , suitable participate study . 13 . Participation clinical study investigational drug/device within 3 month prior first day dose . 14 . Significant hypersensitivity study drug . 15 . Inability comply QD injection regimen . Inclusion criteria extension 3 month treatment : 1. write informed consent continue treatment 2 . Patient complete initial ~3 month treatment period without evidence severe clinically relevant adverse event , change vital sign , change safety laboratory ECGs 3 . Patient lose ~5 kg weight treatment period</criteria>
