	<brief_title>A Novel Surgical Method Treatment Unstable Vitiligo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitiligo , common depigmenting disorder 'idiopathic ' , acquire pigmentary disorder cause loss functional melanocyte epidermis . The course disease unpredictable often progressive phase stabilize depigmentation . It usually begin childhood young adulthood . Approximately one third one half patient develop disease age 20 year . The presence vitiligo expose area body lead social embarrassment , psychological turmoil , cosmetic disfigurement affect . Its prevalence 1 % , range 0.1 &gt; 8.8 % different country globe . Both sex equally affect although great number report among female probably due great social consequence woman girl affected condition . Treatment option A number therapeutic option vitiligo available still need treatment promptly effective . There curative treatment condition . Management vitiligo real challenge dermatologist . Medical therapy : Corticosteroids ( Topical , intralesional systemic ) , Oral mini pulse , PUVA ( topical systemic ) , NBUVB , calcipotriol tacrolimus use widely . Some less commonly use medical modality include phenylalanine , khellin , topical minoxidil , levamisole melagenina . Recently oral minocycline show effective treating vitiligo . Most therapy aim restore melanocyte function anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory action prevent melanocyte auto destruction normal skin appearance function restore . Surgical therapy : All patient vitiligo initially treat medical method . Surgical method important solution stable vitiligo refractory medical treatment . High repigmentation rate obtain procedure far describe anatomic location , little help acral area bony prominence . Unilateral vitiligo clinical form best response graft transplant method , good proportion patient stable bilateral disease also respond adequately . Nevertheless , appropriate patient selection important achieve maximal results.However none surgical modality develop far uniformly effective patient body site need constant research innovation well surgical therapeutic option vitiligo . Aims various surgical procedure : A ) Camouflage Tattooing : Introduction artificial pigment lesion permanent camouflage . B ) Excision : Removal depigmented area , e.g . excision primary closure cover thin Thiersch 's graft . C ) Melanocyte transplantation : commonly use method autologous transplant melanocyte Tissue graft : 1 . Thin ultra-thin split thickness graft ( STSG ) 2 . Suction blister epidermal graft ( SBEG ) 3 . Mini punch graft ( MPG ) 4 . Hair follicular graft ( HFG ) Cellular graft : 5 . Noncultured epidermal cell suspension ( NCES ) 6 . Cultured `` pure '' melanocyte ( CM ) 7 . Cultured epithelial graft ( CE ) 8 . Autologous noncultured extracted hair follicle outer root sheath cell suspension also call follicular cell suspension ( FCS ) D ) Therapeutically wound lesion stimulate melanocytes periphery black hair follicle proliferate , migrate re-pigment lesion , e.g . therapeutic dermabrasion , laser ablation , cryosurgery ( liquid nitrogen spray ) , needle local application phenol trichloroacetic acid . Every method advantage disadvantage . As specific data available prospective study field , easy recommend surgical approach vitiligo offer best result . 'Vitiligo global issue consensus conference , 2011 ' convene Vitiligo European Task Force ( VETF ) , conclude assessment 'overall ' stability inaccurate unreliable , whereas individual lesion stability reliable , especially use context surgical intervention . Methods Size Lesions : Depending size treat area , method may vary . Simple method mini punch graft suction epidermal graft useful small medium size lesion . On contrary , extensive depigmented defect , cellular transplant may require . Age : Because invasive nature surgical procedure , recommend child ; nevertheless , highly motivated adolescent treat sedation general anesthesia . Also , surprise see patient beyond age 50 year may interested surgical repigmentation . Psychological Aspects : Some patient high emotional trauma depigmentation may seek advice invasive procedure . However , psychological evaluation may need ascertain real need surgical treatment . Photographic Record : Illustrations recommend help determine percentage improvement , quality repigmentation possible side effect . Patient 's Expectations : Repigmentation always comparable normally pigment skin final result vary considerably patient patient . However , individual please achieve result ; minor imperfection far less important noticeable repigmentation vitiliginous skin , mainly ethnic skin patient dark complexion ; sometimes surgical repigmentation may look even well observe many patient medical therapy . Method Donor Site : Appropriate training specific method important prerequisite surgical therapy . Donor site hidden possible gluteal region may suitable purpose patient . Success rate different surgical option : Among procedure , suction blister epidermal graft thin ultra-thin split-thickness graft seem effective procedure , overall success rate 80.3 % ( CI 76.4-84.2 % ) 77.9 % ( CI 72.2-83.6 % ) respectively . But , recent randomize study directly compare NCES SBEG show NCES significantly good SBEG . Among cellular graft , technique seem equally effective success rate 61.1 % ( CI 56.1-66.1 % ) , 63.6 % ( CI 57.2-70 % ) , 63.6 % ( CI 55.8-70.6 % ) noncultured epidermal cell suspension , culture melanocyte culture epidermis respectively . The mean repigmentation noncultured extracted outer root sheath cell suspension 65.7 % ) . NONCULTURED EPIDERMAL CELL SUSPENSION The technique noncultured epidermal suspension pioneer Gauthier et al . The suspension prepare incubate donor skin obtain scalp trypsin 0.25 % 18 hr . The suspension inject blister raise cryotherapy . Eight 12 patient treat &gt; 70 % repigmentation vitiligo site . It propose presence keratinocytes suspension supply essential growth factor melanocyte growth . They state technique could emerge simple effective alternative costly culture melanocyte transplantation technique . NON-CULTURED DERMAL CELL SUSPENSION Dermal mesenchymal cell originally isolate dermis juvenile adult mouse Toma et al. , afterwards , group identify cell population human skin . Georg Bartsch firstly identify characterize dermal mesenchymal cell ( DMCs ) . DMCs multi-lineage differentiation potential adipocytes , osteocytes chondrocytes . The surface antigenic profile DMCs positive CD90 differs regard negativity CD34 . Zhou et al investigated factor determine efficiency autologous melanocyte transplantation vitiligo patient focus perilesional skin home CD8+ T lymphocytes , study potential effect dermal mesenchymal cell ( DMCs ) CD8+ T cell activity vitro . The patient high number perilesional CD8+ T cell associate poor repigmentation rate significant less number CD8+ T cell infiltrate patient excellent good re-pigmentation response . Also , skin home CD8+ T cell proliferation significantly inhibit co-culture DMCs 1:1 ratio percentage proliferative CD8+ T cell drop 94.72 % 39.50 % ( p,0.05 ) DMCs co-culture . In co-culture system , DMCs significantly inhibit skin homing CD8+ T proliferation induce cell apoptosis . These data confirm DMCs induces significant immunosuppressive ability skin home CD8+ T lymphocytes may help improve efficacy melanocyte transplantation . Non-cultured Dermal Cell Suspension ( NDCS ) novel method increase efficacy non-cultured epidermal cell suspension ( NCES ) .</detailed_description>
