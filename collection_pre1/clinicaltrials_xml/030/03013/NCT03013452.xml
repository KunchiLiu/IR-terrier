	<brief_summary>In study , investigate two mode chest physiotherapy lung clearance index ( LCI ) , 50 patient bronchiectasis randomize either oPEP autogenic drainage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oscillating PEP v Autogenic Drainage People With Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One fundamental treatment management bronchiectasis airway clearance , effectively rid airway mucus prevent secondary infection inflammation . While effective airway clearance widely accept first line treatment , choice airway clearance method complicate lack evidence base . One obstacles establish evidence efficacy airway clearance technique device limitation choice endpoint . Aerobika ( Trudell medical international , Canada ) oscillate positive expiratory pressure ( oPEP ) device , design develop effective clearance secretion people suppurative lung disease . It test find safe effective chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) - chronic bronchitis . The lung clearance index ( LCI ) measure multiple breath washout ( MBW ) measure ventilation inhomogeneity show sensitive lung function test early lung disease . Its usefulness demonstrate cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , particularly child adult mild disease . LCI assess bronchiectasis find significantly different normal subject , correlate Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) . The aim study test long term effect daily lung clearance LCI , quality life exacerbation use Aerobika oPEP device versus autogenic drainage ( AD ) people bronchiectasis . 50 patient confirm bronchiectasis enrol study . Participants randomize daily physiotherapy either Aerobika Autogenic drainage . Change LCI , measure one month , primary endpoint study .</detailed_description>
