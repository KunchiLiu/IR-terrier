	<brief_summary>Rationale : Cystoscopy cytology , current 'gold standard ' detection follow-up primary recurrent bladder cancer limitation . CLE , high resolution imaging technique , use combined endo-urological procedure , seem promise improve diagnosis bladder cancer . The diagnostic accuracy cystoscopic apply confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE ) still define . Objective : To directly correlate CLE image histopathology , identify define CLE characteristic normal urothelium , benign bladder urothelium , bladder tumor ( low-grade , high-grade carcinoma situ ( CIS ) ) low urinary tract . Primary objective : develop descriptive image interpretation criterion classification CLE image bladder tissue review prospectively obtain CLE video bladder tissue correlate histopathology . Secondary objective : - Assessing procedure related adverse event CLE - Assessing technical feasibility CLE - To develop CLE image atlas urothelium low urinary tract ( normal , benign , low-grade high-grade CIS )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicenter , observational study ; investigator establish sensitivity specificity CLE ex vivo vivo , diagnosis bladder carcinoma . Eligible patient diagnose bladder tumor outpatient clinic schedule transurethral resection bladder tumor ( TURB ) . In total investigator want include 60 patient . Yearly approximately 70 patient diagnosed primary recurrent bladder carcinoma Academic Medical Center ( AMC ) undergo TURB . Their Urologist inform patient diagnose bladder tumor schedule treatment mean TURB study . Information study provide orally write form . CLE image record use probe-based system ( Cellvizio 100 series , Mauna Kea Technologies , Paris , France ) . The probe ( Cystoflex UHD-R , Mauna Kea Technologies , Paris , France ) outer diameter 2.8 mm , field view 240 µm resolution 1 µm . Images collect scan rate 12 frame per second . Using Cellvizio Viewer system , investigator observe mucosal microarchitecture increase field view mosaic post processing . This system also enable virtual stain mucosal structure enhance tissue contrast . A fluorescent contrast agent need obtain CLE image . Fluorescein ( fluoresceinedisodium , Fresenius Kabi , Zeist , Netherlands ) , non-toxic commonly use fluorescent dye administer intravesical ( 300-400 mL 0.1 % fluorescein dilute saline ) leave indwell 5 minute stain extracellular matrix . The study consist three CLE measurement , one vivo prior tumor resection , second ex vivo resect specimen , last measurement ex vivo fixating tumor formaldehyde . In case multiple tumor , multiple CLE measurement do . The measurement per-operatively add approximately 15 minute operate time . In ex vivo set , additional image acquire use Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) . During tumor resection , small chip normal urothelium resect additionally act control . Resected bladder tissue fix laminate pathology department , correlate CLE image .</detailed_description>
