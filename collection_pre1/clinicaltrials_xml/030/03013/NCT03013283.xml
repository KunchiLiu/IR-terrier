	<detailed_description>Home ventilation technique consist mainly two technique , Continuous Positive Airway Pressure CPAP ( level pressure deliver constant ) Non Invasive Ventilation NIV ( pressure level varies expiratory pressure inspiratory pressure ) . Whether CPAP NIV , pressure deliver patient via interface . Many manufacturer produce interface interface subject regular technological innovation introduction market new product range . Because lack dedicate actualized study , poor evidence base difference old new interface , also poor evidence base difference manufacturer product . The efficacy CPAP NIV condition part observance patient device . Because comfort degree satisfaction patient interface key factor observance , side-effects satisfaction patient need continuously evaluate available interface CPAP NIV treat patient . The purpose research evaluation interface side-effects degree satisfaction home care patient treat least three month CPAP NIV . A visual analog scale use assess patient perception interface . A measure quality life home care technician evaluation perform simultaneously . Using device manufacturer software , measure observance , level pressure leak realise .</detailed_description>
