	<brief_summary>Physical inactivity result reduction glucose tolerance less sensitivity insulin . If inactivity last long enough result insulin resistance type 2 diabetes . A high protein diet reduce elevate glucose level individual type 2 diabetes . Thus investigator interested establish period inactivity diet modification minimize glucose change normally observe inactivity . The objective project determine short-term high protein ( HP ) feed protects change glucose level normally observe physical inactivity . The investigator also examine measure blood vessel function , blood lipid blood pressure . Twelve subject complete two 10 day study period reduce physical activity study study period . For test subject follow measurement : postprandial glucose response mixed meal , 24 h free living blood pressure control acute physical inactivity , blood lipid , change body composition , change circadian rhythm use skin temperature ( ibutton ) , measurement aerobic capacity ( VO2 max ) , blood vessel responsiveness ( flow mediate dilation -FMD ) change free live glucose level ( continuous glucose monitor system ( CGMS ) . Subjects complete two condition ( high protein -HP v normal protein - NP diet ) randomize cross-over design . In inactive phase subject reduce step &amp; lt ; 5,000 steps/d consume either HP NP diet . Completion study take 8-10 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It well know insulin resistance increase risk cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes , substantially impact mortality morbidity present significant economic burden . Energy restriction without exercise demonstrate attenuate/reverse development insulin resistance reduce risk cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes . Indeed , accumulate evidence suggest diet high protein may possess additional protection development insulin resistance energy restriction . Layman et al . find high protein diet ( HP ) ( PRO 125 g/d ) compare isocaloric high carbohydrate diet ( HCHO ) ( PRO 68 g/d ) result great reduction fast glucose 2 h postprandial insulin level 16 week energy restriction overweight woman . Similarly , hypocaloric high protein diet ( PRO 45 % vs 20 % ; 21 diet treatment ) increase glucose oxidation improve insulin sensitivity compare isocaloric high carbohydrate diet euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp procedure . In addition , marker inflammation , β-cell function , postprandial glucose insulin level improve addition increase rest energy expenditure 6 month hypocaloric HP compare HCHO diet premenopausal woman independent weight loss . The increase REE improvement adipose tissue function may potential mechanism HP diet improve β-cell function since NEFAs low , may reduce lipotoxicity pancreas . It evident physical inactivity ( highlight bed rest study ) impair glucose tolerance , insulin sensitivity , vascular function , muscle protein synthesis healthy obese individual . This model inactivity , however , extreme recapitulate physical inactivity paradigm see natural human environment . Consequently , less extreme reduction daily physical activity ( &gt; 10,000 steps/d ~1,500 steps/d ) result significant reduction insulin sensitivity , glucose tolerance , insulin-stimulated muscle Akt phosphorylation , suggest impairment insulin sensitivity glucose tolerance precede change body composition . A reduction ambulatory activity highly valid translatable model study role inactivity development metabolic disease , individual go period inactivity , show reduction daily step decrease insulin sensitivity increase visceral adiposity . To date , study test effect diet composition perturbation physical inactivity . It important know increase protein intake mitigates negative perturbation reduce ambulatory activity . Thus , overall objective project determine extent short-term high protein ( HP ) feeding may protect metabolic perturbation physical inactivity ( i.e . PPG , hyperinsulinemia , insulin sensitivity ) . The investigator also examine measure vascular function free living blood pressure addition lipemic response ( i.e . FFAs , triglyceride , cholesterol , lipoprotein ) determine HP diet impact vascular function lipemic response short term physical inactivity . Trial Objectives Purpose The specific aim project include follow : Specific Aim 1 : To determine HP diet period low physical activity lower insulin response meal , help maintain insulin sensitivity β-cell function laboratory base mixed meal test ( MMT ) stable isotope tracer . Specific Aim 2 : To determine HP diet period low physical activity maintain glycemic control measure continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) healthy , recreationally active , young individual .</detailed_description>
