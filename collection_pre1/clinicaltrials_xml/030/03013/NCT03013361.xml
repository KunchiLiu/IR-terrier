	<detailed_description>Functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS ) minimally invasive safe technique treatment sinonasal disease . Although minimally invasive less traumatic procedure , usually associate pain mild moderate intensity reach maximum level first postoperative hour . However , even low-level postoperative pain may associate delayed functional recovery frequently contribute dissatisfaction procedure delay return work readmission surgery . Postoperative analgesia FESS achieve opioids , NSAIDs , topical infiltration local anaesthetic regional technique like sphenopalatine ganglion ( SPG ) block , infraorbital nerve block nasociliary block . As sensory innervation SPG supply nasal turbinate , nasopharynx palate , SPG block expect provide perioperative analgesia FESS . Integration regional anaesthesia general anaesthesia technique provide good hemodynamic control , less perioperative opioid use , less bleed high level patient ' satisfaction . Reduction surgical bleeding FESS improve surgical field also surgeon ' satisfaction reduce opioid use may translate less postoperative nausea &amp; vomiting , rapid recovery early hospital discharge . But , current evidence regard benefit SPG block FESS controversial . In randomized controlled trial , efficacy sphenopalatine ganglion block evaluate use bupivacaine ropivacaine local anaesthetic adult patient undergo FESS general anaesthesia .</detailed_description>
