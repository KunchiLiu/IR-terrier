	<brief_summary>Although incidence gastric cancer substantially decline several decade , still sixth common cancer fourth frequent cause cancer death worldwide . Surgery still curative option gastric cancer . However , patient unable undergo surgery late stage , unresectable disease . The prognosis patient poor . Although Magic trial show perioperative chemotherapy increase rate curative surgery significantly improve overall survival patient operable gastric low esophageal adenocarcinoma , pCR event report trial . The intervention arm PREACT consist pre-operative chemotherapy , pre-operative radiochemotherapy , surgery post-operative chemotherapy . The control arm consist pre-operative chemotherapy , surgery , post-operative chemotherapy . The primary purpose PREACT investigate whether addition radiochemotherapy chemotherapy superior chemotherapy alone pre-operative set improve disease free survival patient locally advance gastric esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma .</brief_summary>
