	<brief_title>Reducing Eating Disorder Risk Factors Among College-Aged Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND &amp; PURPOSE The current project seek examine acceptability efficacy cognitive dissonance-based ( DB ) eat disorder prevention program college-aged men body image concern . Eating disorder represent public health problem efficacious , disseminable treatment largely remain unknown , particularly male . Epidemiological data support increase prevalence eat disorder body image concern among men ; however , program develop address concern relevant men , many men feel uncomfortable program identify eat disorder `` female '' problem . Given eat disorder particularly difficult treat , disseminable intervention target high-risk group prior eat disorder onset may best way reduce public health burden associate eat disorder . As body image concern represent potent consistent risk factor develop eat disorder male female , men body image concern represent one high-risk , underserved , group . Recent prevention research use DB principle challenge thin-ideal internalization decrease likelihood develop eat disorder female youth . Additionally , investigator recently adapt evaluated DB program gay male ( The PRIDE Body Project ) , represent another high-risk group among men . Dissonance theory state individual engage counter-attitudinal behavior experience psychological discomfort , lead alter attitude congruent behavior . Several study support efficacy DB program reduce eat disorder risk among female result The PRIDE Body Project extend efficacy program gay male . These DB intervention utilized peer co-leaders , capitalize importance peer influence eat behavior among college-aged female male . To date , The PRIDE Body Project , study examine eat disorder prevention intervention high-risk group male . Notably , success The PRIDE Body Project several line research support adapt DB program may also helpful reduce eat disorder risk among young men body image concern . First , internalization mesomorphic ideal play central role risk develop eat pathology male . Thus , intervention target internalization body ideal may particularly helpful male . Second , study support peer influence body dissatisfaction disorder eating male concurrently prospectively socialization . This suggest men , regardless sexual orientation , may benefit peer-led DB program address body image concern . This work could fill critical gap care provide grow demographic among suffer eat disorder . Thus , aim present study determine acceptability efficacy adapt cognitive DB intervention use college-aged men body image concern . 112 men body image concern recruit participate randomize control trial ( RCT ) , randomize either DB intervention ( n=52 ) wait list control ( WL ) condition ( n=60 ) . The investigator hypothesize : ( 1 ) The men DB group would show significantly great reduction measure compare men WL group ; ( 2 ) Differences group would maintain 4-week follow-up . DESIGN Participants Participants ( n=112 ) recruit introductory upper division psychology class Florida State University ( FSU ) , psychology research participant pool , advertisement around campus local community . Based retention rate The PRIDE Body Project , investigator estimate 75 % retention rate . Analyses support expect sample size provide sufficient power detect group difference , base effect size previous DB study . Procedure All participant first complete eligibility phone screen determine whether met study eligibility criterion . Participants qualify interested participate study direct complete online consent form . This intervention adapt two-session DB intervention investigator develop gay men , originally adapt woman address risk factor specific male body image concern , regardless sexual orientation . Participants complete baseline measure assess eat disorder muscle dysmorphia risk factor , select base demonstrated reliability validity previous study , particularly use men . The two , 2-hour intervention session space one week apart . Intervention group include 4-10 member take place FSU psychology building . The investigator undergraduate peer co-leader facilitate intervention group . During Session 1 , participant : ( ) define male `` body-ideal '' , ( b ) discuss origin/perpetuation `` body-ideal '' , ( c ) brainstorm cost pursue `` ideal '' , ( ) participate verbal challenge counter `` body-ideal '' message , ( e ) assign homework assignment . In Session 2 participant : ( ) review homework , ( b ) engage role play counter pursuit `` body-ideal '' ( c ) discuss way challenge avoid negative `` body talk '' ( ) list way resist pressure pursue ideal individually university level ( term `` body activism '' ) ( e ) select exit exercise practice positive body talk . All intervention session audiotaped ensure facilitator adherence protocol . Baseline measure repeat condition immediately post-intervention/after one-week interval 4-weeks post-intervention/after five-week interval , assess immediate longer-term effect . Data Analytic Plan The data analytic approach utilized hierarchical linear modeling ( HLM ) , control repeat assessment participant nest within group .</detailed_description>
