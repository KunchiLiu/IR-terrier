In operating room , intravenous access obtain , central venous catheterisation pulmonary artery catheterisation do per institutional protocol . Once Transthoracic echocardiogram ( TTE ) perform patient induced opioids , intravenous inhalational agent , muscle relaxant accord patient clinical hemodynamic condition . Once patient airway secure tracheal tube , transesophageal echocardiogram ( TEE ) perform bypass , routine patient undergo cardiac surgery institution . Echocardiographic image analyse two separate echocardiographers detect inter-individual variability . Patient blood pressure heart rate maintain within 20 % baseline value throughout surgery . Based patient condition end surgery , extubation do operating room intensive care unit ( ICU ) period elective ventilation .</detailed_description>
