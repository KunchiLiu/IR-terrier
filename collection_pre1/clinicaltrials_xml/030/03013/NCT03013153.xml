	<brief_title>Low High Ligation IMA With Apical Lymph Node Dissection Rectal Cancer Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According report World Health Organization 2015 , morbility mortality colorectal cancer ( CRC ) rise world . Although technique get great approval CRC surgical treatment recent year , TME protocol , neoadjuvant laparoscopy technique , complication anastomosis leakage nerve damage still solve . Laparoscopy colon surgery accept worldwide recent year . But still argument effect laparoscopy rectal surgery . Laparoscopy advantage show inferior mesenteric artery , protection autonomic nerve , low rectal anastomosis , total mesorectum excision . However , debate best level IMA ligation whether splenic flexure debonded never end . This study go give clear definite answer surgeon deal IMA laparoscopy rectal surgery . The ligation level IMA affect hypogastric pelvic nerve , lead disorder sexual urination function . What 's , also affection apical lymph node ( No.253 ) harvest blood supplement proximal colon . Former study prove blood supplement tension anastomosis lead leakage surgery . Meanwhile , ligation level IMA key point . The former study come sixth affiliated hospital find mistake ligation level IMA happen poor touch explosion laparoscopy . The distance root IMA leave colic artery ( DRL ) vary 19mm 64mm . When surgeon make mistake ligation , lead insufficient resection apical lymph node . Further , affect long-term survival . Besides , 4 different type IMA accord relationship leave colic artery , sigmoid artery superior rectal artery . These branch confuse surgeon deal . 3D reconstruction abdominal pelvic CT able show length DRL , IMA type apical lymph node clearly . With technique , investigator preserve leave colic artery resect apical lymph node precisely . In past study , high low ligation take advantage side . But none come retrospective clinical trail . Some author believe high ligation well resection apical lymph node , release tension anastomosis , provide precise tumor stag . On side , author consider high ligation may cut blood supplement , rise incident anastomosis leakage ( AL ) . prefer low ligation high . Some study show long term survival difference high low ligation IMA laparoscopy rectal resection . So whether high ligation necessary , still prove . For local advanced rectal cancer , neoadjuvant chemotherapy lesson tumor size , reduce recurrence , preserve annual good rise long-term survival . National Comprehensive Cancer Network command chemotherapy surgery ( Total Mesorectal Excision TME ) standard rectal cancer since 2005 . Another randomize control trial ( RCT ) name Neoadjuvant FOLFOX6 Chemotherapy With Without Radiation Rectal Cancer ( FOWARC ) NCT01211210 prove recent positive result . In case , positive metastasis apical lymph node appear less 5 % ( 5/116 ) case . On side , incident AL 7 % ( 8/116 ) . This phenomenon discover maybe low ligation apical lymph node dissection get treatment effect decrease AL happening .</detailed_description>
