	<brief_summary>The PeriAPPAC trial prospective randomise study compare interval laparoscopic appendectomy follow-up MRI patient initially successfully treat periappendicular abscess . Periappendicular abscess generally initially treat conservatively antibiotic therapy necessary , drainage . Operative treatment acute abscess phase associate increased morbidity thus complicate appendicitis periappendicular abscess initially treat conservatively . However , debate whether interval appendectomy require . After initial successful conservative treatment CT- MRI-diagnosed periappendicular abscess , patient enrol PeriAPPAC study randomise either interval appendectomy follow-up MRI two month initial treatment . All patient also undergo colonoscopy , appendectomy patient prior surgery MRI patient MRI ( outpatient visit endoscopy unit information MRI ) . The primary endpoint treatment success treatment arm . In interval appendectomy evaluate possible morbidity relate appendectomy follow-up treatment arm possible recurrence appendicitis and/or abscess one-year follow-up .
