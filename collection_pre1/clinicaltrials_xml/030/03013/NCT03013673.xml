	<brief_title>Predicting Visceral Leishmaniasis HIV Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV co-infection drastically increase risk develop active VL . Clinical outcome dire immune-compromised patient even best available treatment , relapse frequent . The incubation period may provide important window opportunity pre-emptive `` screen treat '' approach HIV co-infected patient prevent progression infection active disease . However , recommendation exist date due lack solid evidence . It known patient high risk disease progression , role parasite/host/HIV factor play asymptomatic infection phase , diagnostic value exist Leishmania infection marker . Such information need develop prognostic clinical tool detection HIV patient high risk develop active VL . Therefore , aim study asymptomatic period precede onset active VL HIV‐infected individual VL endemic region Ethiopia avenue develop evidence‐based screen treat strategy prevent progression active VL . This prospective cohort study two year follow-up patient remain VL free . Patients develop active VL study period follow one year disease onset .</detailed_description>
