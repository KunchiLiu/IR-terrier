	<brief_summary>Tendon adhesion hand remain ubiquitous problem face hand surgeon hand therapist alike . Despite commonality , consensus exist best mean prevent adhesion , ideal method treat occur . The purpose study compare patient outcomes standard operative tenolysis perform adhesion hand outcomes tenolysis use allograft human amniotic membrane .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amniotic Membrane Wrapping Tenolysis Versus Tenolysis Alone Treatment Tendon Adhesions Hand/Wrist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients schedule undergo operative tenolysis flexor and/or extensor tendon hand recruit . Our target enrollment 40 patient ( 20 control plus 20 experimental ) , base power analysis detail next paragraph . Enrolled patient randomize either standard operative tenolysis , tenolysis placement AlloWrap . Randomization perform computerized random number generator . All surgery perform one senior fellowship-trained hand surgeon . Baseline measurement total active motion ( TAM ) , passive range motion ( PROM ) , survey score Quick Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand ( QuickDASH ) Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation ( PRWE ) record pre-operatively . In addition , patient ' pain level assess use visual analog scale ( VAS ) rest , examination . These value re-evaluated post-operative follow-up visit 2 week , 1 month , 3 month 6 month . PROM also evaluate intra-operatively surgeon , document .</detailed_description>
