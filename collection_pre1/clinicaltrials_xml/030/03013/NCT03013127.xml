	<brief_title>A Study Pembrolizumab Patients With Relapsed Or Metastatic Osteosarcoma Not Eligible Curative Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients osteosarcoma , eligible surgery curative intent complete least one line systemic therapy , consider treatment pembrolizumab . Patients consider medically unfit chemotherapy treatment option believe major benefit may also consider . Patients receive pembrolizumab 35 cycle . Patients , receive 35 cycle pembrolizumab discontinue study treatment another reason progression , follow-up period assess safety treatment-related toxicity ( 90 day ) , progression survival . Patients achieve clinically meaningful response 35 cycle pembrolizumab , define complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) assess Investigator use RECIST , v1.1 , experience clinically significant toxicity study treatment , may consider reintroduction pembrolizumab , progression detect &gt; 8 week cycle 35 . Due low incidence osteosarcoma , inclusion rate expect low , thus Simon 's two-stage design suggest . Evaluation efficacy safety stage one perform first 12 patient treat 18 week : - In case ≤2 responder ; trial end . - If ≥3 responder , trial continue stage II total number 25 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically confirm osteosarcoma . 2 . Disease relapse progression least one line systemic treatment . 1 . Firstline systemic treatment include cytotoxic chemotherapy accord local practice . 2 . The patient eligible he/she consider medically unfit chemotherapy , assess sarcoma centre charge patient 's treatment . 3 . Surgical resection curative intent possible . 4 . Be willing able provide write informed consent/assent trial . 5 . Be &gt; 18 year age day sign informed consent . 6 . Have measurable disease base RECIST , version 1.1 . 7 . Be willing provide tissue newly obtain core excisional biopsy tumor lesion . Newlyobtained defined specimen obtain 6 week ( 42 day ) prior initiation treatment Day 1 . Subjects newlyobtained sample provide ( e.g . inaccessible subject safety concern ) may submit archived specimen . 8 . Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale . 9 . Demonstrate adequate organ function define Table 1 , screen lab perform within 10 day treatment initiation . 10 . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . 11 . Female subject childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication ( Reference Section 5.7.2 ) . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . 12 . Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . 1 . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . 2 . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . 3 . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) 4 . Has history ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid current pneumonitis . 5 . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . 6 . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 7 . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . 8 . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . 9 . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or sarcomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include sarcomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . 10 . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . 11 . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . 12 . Has active infection require systemic therapy . 13 .
