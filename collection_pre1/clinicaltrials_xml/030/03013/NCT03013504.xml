	<brief_title>A Phase III Trial Compare HD201 Combination With Docetaxel Herceptin® Combination With Docetaxel Patients With HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomise , double-blind , parallel group , equivalence , multicentre Phase III study . 560 patient HER2+ metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) randomise ( 1:1 ) receive either HD201 combination docetaxel ( n=280 ) Herceptin® combination docetaxel ( n=280 ) . HD201 Herceptin® concomitant docetaxel administer every 3 week end 8th cycle , disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , noncompliance withdrawal consent patient , investigator decides discontinue treatment , whichever come first . Patients without disease progression 8th cycle continue receive HD201 Herceptin® without docetaxel total 12 month first treatment administration . Continued treatment docetaxel discretion treat physician . Patients complete first 12 month treatment discontinue study attend End Study visit 4 week last administration study medication . After last administration study medication patient treat accord physician 's discretion . These patient follow every 3 month additional 12 month death , whichever occur first , collect data cardiac safety disease status . All procedure perform investigator discretion . All patient withdraw study end first 12 month treatment follow least 12 month death , whichever occur first . Patients attend study visit every 3 week ( +/- 3 day ) . At visit , patient undergo complete physical examination , vital sign , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , weight , performance status , clinical laboratory test , adverse event ( AEs ) , concomitant medication patient compliance . Tumor response evaluate screen every 3 treatment cycle , use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours ( RECIST ) . The image technique use throughout entire duration study . Cardiac safety assess screen every 3 treatment cycle throughout study use echocardiography multi gate acquisition ( MUGA ) scan evaluate leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) . The primary efficacy endpoint , ORR , define proportion patient whose best overall response either complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) accord RECIST . The best overall response best response record start study treatment end 8th cycle . Sparse sample perform subset patient ( 75 per treatment group ) facilitate population-based pharmacokinetic ( PK ) approach use nonlinear mixed-effects model . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee act advisory capacity monitor patient safety efficacy PK data trial . The member select basis relevant experience understand clinical research issue specific therapeutic area , well previous data monitoring committee experience .</detailed_description>
