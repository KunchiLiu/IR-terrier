	<brief_title>A Phase Ib Study NVX-508 Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) genetic disorder hemoglobin affect million individual worldwide , sub-Saharan Africa bearing great burden disease . The leading cause hospitalization death individual sickle cell disease painful VOE ( associate tissue injury reduce oxygen supply ) `` acute chest syndrome '' respectively . Acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) form acute lung injury unique SCD arise de novo course painful VOE . A safe , reliable therapeutic deploy early course painful VOE ( without ACS ) restore oxygen supply tissue , could potentially attenuate tissue injury , resolve pain improve patient outcomes . NVX-508 liquid fluorocarbon transport oxygen . Stoichiometrically , NVX-508 200 time oxygen carry capacity human hemoglobin.Oxygen take NVX-508 circulate alveolar capillary bed lung release blood tissue low oxygen content . Consequently , administer intravenously ( IV ) pass lungs patient , would take oxygen , increase oxygen concentration blood dose-dependent manner release tissue low oxygen . The active component NVX-508 originally develop ultrasound contrast agent . It test 2200 patient safely administer bolus IV injection.The pharmacokinetics NVX-508 human exhibit biphasic decline iv bolus dose ; rapid initial decline follow slow terminal phase . The terminal phase t1/2 ( half- life ) range 81-99.5 min dose 0.15-0.35 ml/kg . NVX-508 metabolized human , remove body unchanged breath ( expired air ) . The rationale study NVX-508 SCD base data preclinical study mouse model ACS . NVX-508 use rescue therapy mouse model , restore oxygen saturation baseline mouse experience hypoxemia , 100 % survival . NVX-508 reduce pulmonary vascular congestion SCD mouse experience ACS . Hypothesis : Intravenous delivery 4 dose NVX-508 0.17 ml/kg per dose , infuse 30 minute well tolerate . Experimental design : Dose-ranging study adult diagnosis SCD ( SS , SC , S-Beta + thalassemia , S-Beta0 thalassemia , SS/S-Hemoglobin D ( SD ) S combination another variant hemoglobin ) , steady state ( painful episode , hospitalization blood transfusion precede 4 week ) recruit single institution ( Ghana Institute Clinical Genetics , Korle-Bu , Accra , Ghana ) participate study . The study 3 + 3 design . The first cohort 3 subject enrol study shall administer one dose ( 0.05 mL/kg ) NVX-508 , next cohort 3 treat use two dos NVX-508 0.05 mL/kg subsequent cohort assign four dos NVX-508 . Higher dose 0.1ml/kg 0.17ml/kg administer Intra-patient dose escalation allow . Each dose shall administer slow IV push 5-10 minute next dose administer less 90 minute cessation prior infusion , 120 minute later . Within cohort , first subject treat , 72 hour observation interval next two subject treat dose . Study Procedures A maximum 24 adult sickle cell disease age 18 year recruit study . Screening - After give informed consent , potential study participant undergo screen comprises standardized history physical examination , lab test ( blood count , serum chemistry ) electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . Eligible participant return within week enrol study . Intervention - Study participant go designated staffed phase I center administration study drug . They baseline evaluation ( arterial blood gas evaluation , hemoglobin EKG ) do prior administration study drug . They receive 1 , 2 4 dos study drug depend They continuously monitor medical research staff principal investigator prior , 4 hour observation period post intervention , physical examination , lab ( complete blood count , serum chemistry , coagulation profile blood sample draw pharmacokinetic study ) EKGs . Subjects discharge clinical trial facility 4 hour observation period adverse event require clinical management . There one week post-intervention observation period dose-limiting toxicity subject , end follow visit . Follow - 1 week administration NVX-508 , subject follow-up visit clinical trial facility include history , physical exam lab . If adverse event problem require continue clinical care monitoring , subject exit study lab clinical data visit completely review .</detailed_description>
