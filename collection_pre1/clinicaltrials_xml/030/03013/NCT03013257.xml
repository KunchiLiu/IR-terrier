	<detailed_description>Graves ' disease ( GD ) autoimmune thyroid disorder cause stimulating auto-antibodies thyrotrophin ( thyroid stimulate hormone [ TSH ] ) receptor thyroid follicular cell . It common cause hyperthyroidism approximately 3 % woman 0.5 % men develop GD lifetime1 . In locality , like Europe Japan , antithyroid drug ( ATDs ) carbimazole propylthiouracil prefer radioactive iodine ( RAI ) surgery initial treatment GD2-4 . This ATDs relatively easy administer , could induce disease remission ( 30-70 % ) avoid life-long thyroid hormone replacement , operative risk radioactivity2-4 . However , possible side-effects , recommend period 12 18 month . Taking ATDs long period seem increase chance remission5 . Therefore , currently , disease relapse 18-month ATD treatment , definitive treatment modality like RAI surgery indicate . Regarding preferable , surgery usually advise patient large compressive goiter ( &gt; 80g ) , suspect documented thyroid malignancy , plan become pregnant within 6 month moderate severe Graves ' ophthalmopathy ( GO ) 2-4 . As result , patient without condition consider RAI2-4 . RAI show cost-effective safe therapy patient GD4,6,7 . In North America , clinical endocrinologist favor RAI initial treatment GD2-4 . However , since RAI usually prescribe outpatient basis , necessary consider nearby individual ' exposure dose formulate radiation precaution carefully8 . Other disadvantage include slow induction euthyroidism , potential worsening GO deferral pregnancy2-4 . Although various dose technique describe ensure adequate radiation delivery thyroid gland , simplest effective method administer fix dose RAI2 . However , due local regulation densely-populated area , administer high RAI dos ( &gt; 400MBq ) permit outpatient basis9 . As result , usual RAI dose usually range 185 370MBq ( i.e . 10mci ) 10 . In addition , despite proven efficacy safety , many patient wish undergo RAI radiation fear prefer either continue ATDs surgery11 . High-intensity focus ultrasound ( HIFU ) non-invasive procedure involve application high-energy focus beam thermal tissue ablation within target zone . It apply variety medical condition include uterine fibroid prostate , breast , pancreatic , liver tumors12 . Unlike ablation device ( like radiofrequency laser ablation ) , HIFU require needle puncture consider safe less operator-dependent13 . Single HIFU treatment show reduce size benign thyroid nodules13,14 . Histologic examination confirm HIFU induce complete tissue necrosis within target area13 . Similar principle RAI ( i.e . use ionize radiation ablate thyroid parenchyma cause GD remission ) , postulate heat energy generate HIFU could also use ablate thyroid parenchyma cause GD remission . The idea use heat energy ablate thyroid parenchyma minimally invasively recently report use radiofrequency ablation15 knowledge , one first ( first ) group propose use HIFU energy ablate thyroid parenchyma definitive treatment relapse GD . Having obtain ethical approval , pilot study conduct examine efficacy safety HIFU treatment relapse GD . Over 2-month period , 20 patient underwent single HIFU treatment relapse GD . The treatment involve ablate entire right , leave central ( isthmic ) lob HIFU pulse . To avoid inadvertent injury heat-sensitive structure like recurrent laryngeal nerve , parathyroid gland , trachea esophagus , deliberately leave 2-3ml thyroid parenchyma non-ablated close trachea-esophageal groove side . The reason leave large amount non-ablated parenchyma experience subtotal thyroidectomy , leave &gt; 6ml normal parenchyma may diminish long-term remission rate16 . In pilot study , patient underwent safe successful HIFU ablation relapse GD . By ultrasound ( USG ) volumetry , mean pre-ablation total thyroid volume 18.5 ± 6.4ml . The average treatment time 72.7 ± 31.0 min total energy deliver patient 21.4 ± 5.9 KJ . No patient suffer major complication afterwards except 2 patient ( 10.0 % ) minor neck redness first week . By 4-week , patient either biochemically euthyroid ( n=15 ) ( without ATDs ) biochemically hypothyroid ( require thyroxine replacement ) ( n=5 ) . At 6-month , 15 ( 75.0 % ) patient remain biochemically euthyroid hypothyroid without ATDs ( i.e . remission ) 5 patient ( 25.0 % ) biochemical hyperthyroidism . However , , 3 require ATDs 2 keep observe . Based result pilot study , hypothesize single HIFU treatment thyroid gland may effective standard outpatient fixed-dose RAI ( 370MBq ) cause remission GD 6-month . If hypothesis turn true , HIFU could become treatment option patient indicate RAI wish one reason another . Apart benefit outpatient treatment , HIFU appear induce fast disease remission lessen need defer pregnancy radiation precaution absence radioactivity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . A diagnosis GD base standard clinical criterion ( elevate thyroid hormone level , suppress TSH , positive TSHR autoantibody , diffuse goiter ± high RAI uptake ) . 2 . Aged 18 70 year old time inform consent 3 . Have least one GD relapse . A relapse define recurrent persistent hyperthyroidism despite complete continued course ATDs 18 month . 4 . Indicated RAI treatment 5 . Valid consent obtain 1 . Prefer clear indication surgery ( large compressive goiter , suspect documented thyroid malignancy , wish become pregnant within 6 month moderate severe GO ) . 2 . Have preexist vocal cord palsy 3 . Are unable move extend neck 4 . Have either right , leave central ( isthmic ) lobe measure &gt; 30ml volume pretreatment USG volumetry ( see later ) 5 . Have concomitant thyroid nodule either indeterminate , suspicious malignancy proven malignant fine needle aspiration cytology ( FNAC ) . 6 . Have active severe Graves ophthalmopathy ( GO ) 7 .
