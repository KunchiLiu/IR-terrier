	<brief_summary>Despite grow public awareness recent progress multimodality therapy colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , CRC still rank high list common deadly cancer Taiwan . The cause CRC mortality due mainly occurrence distant metastasis . Several report suggest circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) highly associate metastasis suggest target CTCs may offer unprecedented opportunity prevent development metastasis . Early detection characterization CTCs therefore important potential strategy monitor progression CRC . The current proposal focus detect CTCs peripheral blood CRC patient use Miselect R system . We monitor amount CTCs correlate CRC progression prognosis .</brief_summary>
