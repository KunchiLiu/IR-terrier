	<brief_summary>Rationale : Initial evaluation usually consist cross sectional imaging urinary tract . When suspect lesion see , ureterorenoscopy plan visualize lesion collect tissue histopathology . These technique consider gold standard diagnosis UTUC . CLE , high resolution imaging technique use combination endo-urological procedure , seem promise improve diagnosis urothelial cancer . CLE image characteristic UTUC still define . Objective : With IDEAL stage 2b explorative pilot study investigator aim assess in-vivo CLE image characteristic normal urothelium , benign urothelium urothelial carcinoma ( low-grade , high-grade CIS ) upper urinary tract qualitatively compare CLE image histopathology diagnostic biopsy pathology therapeutic radical nephroureterectomy . Secondary objective development image atlas assess technical feasibility procedure related adverse event CLE .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study prospective , mono-center observational human , vivo pilot study ass in-vivo CLE characteristic normal urothelium , benign urothelium urothelial carcinoma ( low-grade , high-grade CIS ) upper urinary tract . Eligible patient suspect tumour upper urinary tract schedule diagnostic URS . Eligible patient inform study urologist . Information study provide verbally write form . CLE image record use probe-based system ( Cellvizio 100 series , Mauna Kea Technologies , Paris , France ) . The probe diameter 0,85 mm , hereby enable passage work channel ureterorenoscope . It depth tissue penetration 50 µm , field view 320 µm resolution 3,5 µm . Images collect scan rate 12 frame per second . Using Cellvizio Viewer system , observe mucosal microarchitecture increase field view mosaic post processing . This system also enable virtual stain mucosal structure enhance tissue contrast . A fluorescent contrast agent need obtain CLE image . Fluorescein ( fluoresceinedinatrium , Fresenius Kabi , Zeist , Nederland ) , non-toxic commonly use fluorescent dye administer work channel ureterorenoscope pyelocaliceal system ( 3 - 5 mL 0.1 % fluorescein dilute saline ) leave indwell 5 minute stain extracellular matrix . In study patient undergo one CLE measurement plan diagnostic URS . We measure average 2 region interest per patient . If patient multiple tumour multiple measurement . The measurement duration per patient add maximally 10 minute URS . At later stage two independent non-blinded observer review CLE image . The CLE image diagnostic URS qualitatively compare histopathology diagnostic biopsy , perform also pathology therapeutic nephroureterectomy . Based UTUC diagnosis diagnostic URS , general one third patient indicate therapeutic radical nephroureterectomy . The two third UTUC patient treated endoscopic treatment . If patient undergo several ureterorenoscopies , may approach CLE measurement consecutive ureterorenoscopies .</detailed_description>
