	<brief_summary>Primary immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) disorder cause autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction decrease platelet production . It report refractory ITP closely related long-lived plasma cell ( PCs ) , resistant glucocorticoid , conventional immunosuppressive cytotoxic drug , irradiation B-cell depletion therapy . Proteasome inhibition bortezomib one promising therapeutic approach target PCs , since strategy show efficiently eliminate multiple myeloma cell , , transform PCs . It also successfully use SLE-like mouse , experimental autoimmune MG rat experimental hemophilia-A mouse develop anti-factor VIII antibody preclinical model deplete short-lived long-lived PCs . Additionally , treatment bortezomib result rapid clinical response patient refractory thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura associate depletion inhibitory autoantibody ADAMTS13 , metalloproteinase cleaves von Wille-brand factor , produce plasma cell . Hence , elimination autoreactive PCs proteasome inhibitor might represent new treatment strategy autoantibody-mediated disease . To date , refractory ITP lack effective treatment finding encourage u conduct study bortezomib management ITP high anti-platelet antibody level . Data study may provide idea bortezomib treatment ITP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single-center Clinical Trial Bortezomib Management Immune Thrombocytopenia ( ITP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator undertake single-center , single-arm study 20 primary ITP adult patient Shandong University Qilu Hospital . All participant select receive bortezomib treatment ( give intravenously dose 1.3mg/m2 day 1,4,8,11 ) . Platelet count , bleed symptom evaluate treatment . Adverse event also record throughout study .</detailed_description>
