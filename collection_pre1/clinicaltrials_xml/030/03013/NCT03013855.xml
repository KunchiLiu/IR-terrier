	<brief_summary>This study investigate use digital rectal exam ( DRE ) obtain stool sample fecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) patient due screen colonoscopy pre-operative patient know colorectal cancer . FIT currently FDA-approved spontaneous stool DRE , however , sample commonly obtain DRE . In addition , clinician remain skeptical accuracy FIT use stool obtain DRE . This study aim assess correlation FIT use stool sample DRE ( FIT-DRE ) standard care FIT ( FIT-SOC ) . If good correlation show , investigator may able demonstrate efficacy FIT use DRE clinic setting . This may help avoid logistical barrier , well improve compliance adherence colon cancer screen outpatient setting , eventually lead improve quality care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Fecal Immunochemical Test Using Digital Rectal Exam</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fecal immunochemical testing ( FIT ) FDA-approved stool-based screening test colorectal cancer . It offer less invasive colorectal cancer screen option patient agreeable colonoscopy measure level Ab-globin complex stool without direct interference diet medication . FIT show selective colorectal bleeding , globin upper GI tract digest proteolytic enzyme . A meta-analysis study analyze FIT show pooled sensitivity 0.79 ( 95 % CI 0.69-0.86 ) specificity 0.94 ( CI 0.92-0.95 ) . In large study compare FIT another stool-based screening test , gFOBT , sensitivity FIT find 0.53-0.73 CRC 0.20-0.25 advance neoplasia compare gFOBT , show 33.3 % CRC 8.6 % advanced neoplasia . In addition , FIT require few stool sample lack dietary medication modification . As result , compliance likely higher , crucial cancer detection . A challenge inherent stool-based screening test compliance sample submission patient . FIT mean improve logistical barrier screen one sample need , however , compliance rate standard care FIT ( FIT-SOC ) approximately 50 % . FIT use stool digital rectal exam ( DRE ) perform clinic visit may effective screen tool patient prefer stool-based screening . FIT FDA-approved test spontaneously pass stool , well stool collect DRE . Manufacturers FIT claim DRE provide sufficient amount stool sampling , however , validated study knowledge demonstrate adequate efficacy . As result , FIT use DRE commonly do clinical practice . This study aim assess correlation FIT use DRE ( FIT-DRE ) standard care FIT ( FIT-SOC ) method obtain stool sample .</detailed_description>
