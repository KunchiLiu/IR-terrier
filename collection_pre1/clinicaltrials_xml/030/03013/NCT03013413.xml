	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study ultrasound-based imaging procedure call elastography use Aixplorer system diagnose prostate cancer patient undergo biopsy . Ultrasound non-invasive imaging technique use high-frequency sound wave produce image internal structure . Elastography use ultrasound image technique examine stiffness elasticity tissue may enhance detection prostate cancer . It yet know whether elastography image use Aixplorer system work well standard ultrasound image detect prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate detection prostate cancer elastography use Aixplorer scanner . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain quantitative data elastic property normal malignant tissue prostate patient refer ultrasound guide biopsy . II . To compare Gleason grade prostate cancer detect elastography Gleason grade tumor detect conventional systematic biopsy .</detailed_description>
