	<brief_title>Daily Consumption Well-Cooked Broccoli May Affect Glucosinolate Metabolites Inflammatory Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consumption Brassica vegetables inversely associate incidence several cancer , include cancer lung , stomach , liver , colon , rectum , breast , endometrium , ovary . Brassica vegetables good source many nutrient , unique characteristic Brassicas ( Broccoli particular ) rich content glucosinolates . Glucosinolates sulfur-containing compound convert isothiocyanate ( ITC ) enzyme plant call myrosinase , release vesicle contain myrosinase rupture chew cut . The isothiocyanate consider active agent cancer prevention . Some mechanism isothiocyanate likely inhibit cancer include modulation cytochrome P450 enzymes , induction phase II enzymes , apoptosis . The aim study investigate daily consumption broccoli myrosinase inactivate cooking influence glucosinolate metabolism absorption , consequent regulation inflammatory marker .</detailed_description>
