	<brief_title>Nivolumab Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Who Have Progresses During After Prior Systemic Anti-angiogenic Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study carry patient suffer refractory metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma . The overall study population consist 450 adult patient . In France , 10600 patient diagnosed kidney cancer 2010 . At time diagnosis , approximately 30 % patient present metastatic disease , 90 95 % metastatic disease clear-cell histology . The present study multicenter , open-label , non-controlled , phase II safety study patient suffer metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma progress one prior systemic anti-angiogenic treatment . Patients intolerant prior systemic anti-angiogenic treatment also eligible . The dose schedule nivolumab study 3 mg/kg every 2 week . Nivolumab administer every 2 week death , disease progression , unacceptable toxicity withdrawal inform consent . 450 patient include period 1 year</detailed_description>
