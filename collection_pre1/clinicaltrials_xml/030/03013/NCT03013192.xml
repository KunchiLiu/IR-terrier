	<detailed_description>Patient compliance prescribe physical therapy ( PT ) exercise report 22-40 % various study . Further , Vasey et al . find 8 % patient even schedule follow PT appointment prescribed . Low adherence present problem since long term completion prescribe home exercise correlate improved health outcome . Sluijs et al . find low adherence PT exercise primarily attribute three factor : ( 1 ) barrier patient perceive encounter , ( 2 ) lack positive feedback , ( 3 ) degree helplessness . An automate phone/texting system help three point increase positive feedback , increase compliance , monitor patient progress . The system continually remind patient end goal possible , decrease feeling helplessness condition . Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) score create unique measurement allow cross study comparison multiple medical discipline . PROMIS attempt measure physical , mental , social health individual chronic condition . PROMIS validate cross study/discipline tool multiple study . PROMIS- Upper Extremity subcategory PROMIS Physical Function focus activity require use upper extremity include shoulder , arm , hand activity . Examples include write , use button , open container . Using PROMIS- Upper Extremities measure upper extremity physical function validate DÃ¶ring et al . Hays et al . While PROMIS- Upper Extremity use monitor shoulder function PT intervention literature , PROMIS score use monitor ankle , foot , knee function rehabilitation . Telemedicine show promise improve outcome orthopedic intervention . Medication adherence patient outcomes show improve intervention include reminder . Also , adoption cell phone nearly ubiquitous worldwide vast majority cell phone user text message , text-message-based intervention seem particularly promising . Many study show SMS text messaging increase treatment compliance . PT adherence prescribed exercise seem limited compliance , Epharmix along several orthopedic surgeon set develop intervention . The result , EpxPhysicalTherapy ( EpxPT ) , automated system ensure patient scheduled physical therapy appointment perform home exercise . It also send motivational text message patient encourage participant perform exercise since lack positive reinforcement correlate decreased compliance . When patient identifies unable schedule PT appointment complete exercise multiple day row , alert sent healthcare team . The system design deliver either voice text-based automated message patient way avoids additional burden healthcare team . EpxPT offer numerous advantage strictly app-based text message-based system old underprivileged patient population . Older patient , may comfortable voice message , option , patient without smartphone still able receive intervention . Patients identify eligible study consent randomly assign one two group : Group 1 receive standard care alone ( control ) Group 2 receive EpxPT intervention . In Group 2 , EpxPT remind patient schedule first PT appointment . Group 2 patient also ask complete prescribed PT exercise every day . They send motivational text message voice call order highlight importance complete PT regimen . Group 2 patient compliance track text response record Epharmix database . Both Group 1 Group 2 patient see follow appointment month three month . At appointment , patient group ask PT compliance ( measurement compliance Group 1 ) , range motion PROMIS- Upper Extremity CAT score measure . - Aim 1 : To compare control intervention group compliance prescribe physical therapy home exercise regimen - Aim 2 : To compare control intervention group shoulder range motion 3 month intervention - Aim 3 : To compare control intervention group PROMIS- Upper Extremity CAT score 3 month intervention</detailed_description>
