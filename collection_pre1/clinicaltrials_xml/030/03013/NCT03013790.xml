	<detailed_description>Summary Melatonin naturally produce hormone involve synchronization circadian rhythm sleep-wake cycle human . It often give sleep aid generally well tolerate , drug-drug interaction . Recent study show marginal benefit increase amount sleep , proven benefit decrease delirium elderly patient medical ward . Delirium serious problem hospital Intensive-Care Units ( ICUs ) , contribute long hospital stay well morbidity mortality . Studies show additional day delirium increase mortality 10 % 1 . It estimate delirium cost US healthcare system $ 38- $ 152 billion annually , cost treat delirious patient 2.5 time higher treat one without delirium . It estimate one third case delirium preventable . Additionally , many medication give ICU worsen delirium , include narcotic , antipsychotic , benzodiazepine . Treatment delirium consist mostly prevention , frequently re-orienting individual , let much natural light possible , frequent touching , provide quiet place rest . Pharmacological treatment consist mostly antipsychotic , often adverse effect worsen delirium . Incidents delirium much high elderly patient , 80 % cohort , well ICU patient . Multiple theory exist , include lack true rest time night , multiple sedative affect sleep-wake cycle , large amount noise . It also know elderly patient less total sleep nighttime arousal , ICUs particular quite loud , especially night . The increase ambient noise pair frequent interruption sleep monitor blood draw exacerbate problem likely lead delirious state . To knowledge , study look melatonin 's effect elderly , non-ventilated patient ICU , group risk develop delirium . Recent study indicate delirium decrease melatonin use simulate ICU environment.2 This randomize , control study would aim confirm result actual ICU environment . Additionally , unknown dos effective treatment delirium . Literature show improvement 3 mg 5 mg , recent meta-analysis show benefit one . 3 Participants Multiple study do critically ill , non-ventilated patient ICU show incidence delirium least 60 % , case 80 % 4 . At Parkview , high incidence record 55 % , patient . It likely percentage much high elderly . Assuming average incidence 70 % , assume would want able detect 20 % decrease incidence intervention , would aim enroll 600 patient ( 200 arm ) , interim analysis do 300 patient asses harm efficacy . This do analyze primary outcome P-value &lt; 0.05 . Exclusion Criteria Patients head trauma Neurosurgical intervention Patients &lt; 65 year age Patients expected life expectancy &lt; 48 hour Blind patient Patients seizure history Patients uncontrolled hypertension Patients supratheraputic ( &gt; 3.0 ) INR Patients strong CYP1A2 inhibitor : ciprofloxacin , fluvoxamine , methoxsalen , ofloxacin , primaquine Patients speak English Spanish Design Upon admission ICU , consecutive , eligible patient POA present informed consent describe trial ( Appendix A ) . All patient 65 screen . Attending physician well Critical Care Fellows allow consent patient . At point decide join trial , order put computer `` melatonin protocol '' . At point , pharmacy assign patient either placebo , 3mg , 5mg arm study 1:1:1 fashion . Physicians , pharmacist , nurse staff blind protocol . Melatonin dosages 3 5mg use study , recent work high dose show `` carryover '' effect follow day . The placebo pill small white tablet similar size 3 5mg tablet melatonin . It sucrose regulated FDA safe human consumption . Either placebo melatonin administer 9pm evening medication . The treatment group give either assign dose placebo nightly . Either PO PT would acceptable . The protocol run patient discharge hospital . Delirium assess use CAM-ICU evaluation tool ICU bCAM floor accord pre-existing protocol . These assess every 12 hour per protocol already place . These tool widely use US , multiple study show reliable detection delirium . The CAM scale attach reference . If patient deteriorates ICU require intubation , continue protocol . Melatonin generally well-tolerated5 , two common side effect headaches confusion . We hope mitigate confusion use low dose melatonin . Incidence headache track , deem necessary attending physician , melatonin therapy stop . Melatonin minor interaction Warfarin dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker , patient 's INR ( Warfarin ) BP track routinely . Melatonin metabolize CYP1A2 system , patient medication potent inhibitor enzyme also exclude study . There interaction Melatonin Olanzipine , sometimes used treatment delirium . There potential increase sedation combination , patient monitor ICU set receive medication . Primary outcome incidence delirium ( use CAM-ICU bCAM score ) study population Secondary outcome : ICU day Total Hospital day 30 90-day mortality Use anti-psychotic medication treatment delirium ( Haloperidol , Ziprasidone , Olanzapine , Quetiapine ) Average Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ( RASS ) score delirium assess Hypothesis Our hypothesis use melatonin significantly decrease incidence delirium elderly , non-ventilated patient . We use accepted P-value &lt; 0.05 determine significance . If p-value n't meet significance , null hypothesis melatonin decrease incidence delirium elderly non-ventilated patient accept . Collection/Retention information : Patients ' CAM-ICU score already document Meditech . Other variable ( patient move floor , patient discharge ) already routinely document . Following completion , variable place database de-identified . The data keep additional 3 year allow analysis require . Nursing staff well house staff undergo brief in-service study principle well reminder use CAM-ICU score . Confidentiality : Only PI see patient 's identify information deidentifying . To ensure patient privacy , informed consent discussion happen patient 's private room Risks : Melatonin proven safe every patient population multiple study . A consensus statement World Sleep Foundation 2000 confirm significant side-effects healthy adult . Specifically , use melatonin seizure disorder controversial , data show detriment showing benefit . For reason , patient seizure disorder exclude study . We use USP ( United States Pharmacopeia ) - certify melatonin well . USP non-profit organization regulate over-the-counter ( OTC ) supplement US . Its seal verifies manufacturer adheres good manufacturing practice . The attend physician case choose withdraw patient study time feel participation adversely affect patient . Compensation : There compensation provide participation study . Benefits : Considering multiple study suggest safety efficacy , critically ill patient stand benefit lack delirium possibly shorter hospital stay . This would benefit Parkview Medical Center well .</detailed_description>
