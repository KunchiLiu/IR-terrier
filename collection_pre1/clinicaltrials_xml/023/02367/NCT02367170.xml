	<brief_summary>Investigators assess effect exercise marker inflammation protein catabolism . This research study understand treat Chronic Critical illness ( CCI ) - related respiratory muscle weakness strength training improve muscle function , also potentially blunt inflammation catabolism Peristent Inflammation/Immunosuppression Catabolism ( PICS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Project 4A : Inspiratory Muscle Training Diaphragm Strength</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In research study , investigator assign study participant two group : high intensity inspiratory muscle training low intensity inspiratory muscle train group . This research study last 28 day 24 mechanically ventilated patient CCI . The goal determine research participant respond train program improve wean outcome ventilator . This determined measurement breathe muscle strength magnetic stimulation , measurement diaphragm thickness ultrasound , inspiratory muscle training , blood urine sample .</detailed_description>
