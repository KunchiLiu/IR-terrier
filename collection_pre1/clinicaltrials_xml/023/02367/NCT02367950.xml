	<detailed_description>Objectives - To evaluate feasibility exercise intervention endometrial cancer survivor term recruitment , adherence , response rate , follow-up rate . - To evaluate feasibility individual component exercise programme within study population . - To evaluate outcome measure use evaluate quality life outcomes psychological distress , fatigue pain endometrial cancer survivor appropriate . - To evaluate outcome measure use evaluate physical fitness appropriate . - To evaluate acceptability exercise intervention endometrial cancer survivor improve quality life outcome . General research design Single-arm prospective feasibility study In addition conduct qualitative evaluation purposively select subgroup maximum variation population . Study population All woman diagnose Royal Cornwall Hospital endometrial cancer complete surgical treatment . Number participant Every year approximately 90 woman diagnose endometrial cancer Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro , approximately 80 woman receive primary surgical treatment . We estimate 50 % 60 % consent participation study ; therefore anticipate sample size study duration 12 month approximately 40 48 woman . As feasibility study , perform power analysis . Setting Single centre study Royal Cornwall Hospital , Truro . Selection identification Women confirm diagnosis endometrial cancer introduce study member clinical team post-operatively admission surgery . Identification potential participant perform member clinical care team ( consist three gynaecological oncologist , Clinical Nurse Specialist ( CNS ) clinical research fellow ) . This perform review medical record use case note electronic clinical database system ( MAXIMS ) , start gynaecological oncologist clinic multidisciplinary gynaecological oncology team meeting . Recruitment Potential participant introduce study clinical care team admission surgical treatment study information sheet give . Potential participant ask member clinical team contact telephone , one week discharge home , discus study detail possible participation . Following telephone call , woman express interest participating study approach next outpatient clinic appointment ( 6 week post-operative ) . Informed consent study seek patient 's clinical visit , occur approximately 6 week operation . During process gynaecological oncologist , CNS clinical research fellow explain detail study , risk , burden possible benefit , answer additional question patient may . Intervention In study , intervention deliver male Cancer Exercise Specialist , fund local charity 'Active Pants ' , provide post-treatment rehabilitation programme cancer patient . The programme objective improve health status promote healthy lifestyle , base specific national guideline ( 27-29 ) . Prior start programme , participant receive health physical fitness assessment Cancer Exercise Specialist . The health assessment include current health physical activity level accord patient , medical condition medical history , restriction patient may experience term exercise . The physical fitness assessment include measure weight height , waist circumference , body fat percentage , muscle percentage rest metabolism 6-minute walk test . In addition , personal goal patient identify . This take approximately 30 minute . The exercise programme consist 60-min individualised ( one-on-one ) personal training session , week , 10 week .

The programme tailor individual patient Cancer Exercise Specialist , take consideration current health status , comorbidities medical history . A personal Cancer Exercise Specialist experience various cancer area supervise exercise programme one one participant , give specific set exercise session , tailor individual patient . After completion 10-week supervised exercise programme , participant give opportunity continue train weekly group session free , supervise Exercise Specialist . The Exercise Specialist document attendance rate participant participant complete 10 exercise session . The 6-min walk test perform completion 10th session programme ass possible change physical fitness compare baseline physical fitness . In addition Exercise Specialist document individual response participant component exercise session tolerate . Follow-up Follow-up take place completion exercise session standard clinical visit gynaecological oncology team , 3 4 month post-operative ( 6 week ) visit . Patients come back 3 month . Data management Data collect clinical care team ( gynaecological oncologist , CNS , clinical research fellow ) patient attend routine outpatient appointment . The data anonymised prior analysed clinical research fellow password secure NHS computer Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro . Data remain password secure file computer transfer onto another medium outside hospital Trust . The manual file include questionnaire store locked office within Royal Cornwall Hospital .

The SMG meet often study set-up less frequently study underway minute circulate SMG member . The sponsor , Royal Cornwall Hospital , arrangements place monitor audit conduct study part sponsor 's obligation Department Health 's Research Governance Framework . The purpose audit inspection systematically independently examine study related activity document determine whether activity conduct , data record , analyse , accurately report accord protocol , Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) , ICH guideline , applicable regulatory requirement .</detailed_description>
