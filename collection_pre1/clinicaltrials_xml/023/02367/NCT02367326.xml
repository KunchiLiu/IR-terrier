	<brief_summary>Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) group together Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . Its prevalence high represent approximately 0.4 % population . The peak incidence disease range 2 30 year age second peak CD recently report 60 . These disease develop time complication require 2/3 case surgical resection procedure CD colectomy 20 % case . Cohort data recently show early use azathioprine first year would decrease need surgery . Aside biologics , azathioprine widely use immunosuppressant IBD management . Its metabolism highly variable overall population since 10 % patient slow metabolizers 15 % fast metabolizers . This explain partly treatment failure side effect thiopurines . A lot research show metabolite measurement azathioprine ( 6-TGN end methylated derivative ) could use clinically even result remain controversial . In fact , positive predicative value ( PPV ) clinical response exceed 60 % . This costly test do everywhere , reimburse national health service , may use country . It , however , key order optimize drug time two anti-TNFs possible event failure thiopurines . Older study show MCV lymphonenia could markers thiopurine impregnation . Recently , American study provide mathematic formula enable achieve 80 % PPV clinical response AZA calculation need confirm , moreover , patent ( costly ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Scores Associated With Favorable Clinical Response With Thiopurines IBD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We suggest develop predictive score clinical thiopurines IBD base routine lab data obtain monitoring patient thiopurines . This initial work enable identify clinical and/or lab factor order develop score base international , multicenter , cross-section study . Two hundred patient treatment failure thiopurines include least many clinical remission thiopurines . A subsequent longitudinal study , recruit center enable validate score . Finally , prospective study assess clinical impact optimization score patient sustain treatment failure thiopurines . This score - confirm - subsequently additional cost management patient thiopurines .</detailed_description>
