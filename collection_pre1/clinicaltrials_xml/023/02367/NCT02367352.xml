	<brief_title>Alisertib ( MLN8237 ) Combination With Weekly Paclitaxel East Asian Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call alisertib . Alisertib combination paclitaxel test find safe well-tolerated dose East Asian patient . The study consist 2 part : dose escalation phase determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) define recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) alisertib plus paclitaxel combination East Asian patient advance solid tumor ; second part expansion cohort RP2D alisertib plus paclitaxel East Asian patient either ovarian cancer small cell lung cancer . This study look safety ( lab result side effect ) pharmacokinetic property ( drug move throughout body ) . This open label study enroll 30 participant . Dose Escalation Phase : Alisertib tablet start dose 15 mg , orally , twice daily , 3 day on/4 day 3 week 28 day cycle combination paclitaxel , 60 mg/m^2 intravenous Cohort 1 escalate dose 25 mg alisertib , orally , twice daily 3 day on/4 day 3 week 28 day cycle Cohort 2 . If ≥ 2 participant experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) dose alisertib decrease 20 mg . Expansion Cohort : alisertib tablet determine RP2D dose orally , twice daily 3 day on/4 day 3 week 28 day cycle combination paclitaxel , 60 mg/m^2 intravenous . Treatment continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Alisertib 15 mg 25 mg tablet - Paclitaxel 60 mg/m^2 intravenous solution This multi-centre trial conduct Japan , Korea , Taiwan . The overall time participate study 24 month .</detailed_description>
