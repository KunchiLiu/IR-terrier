	<detailed_description>Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( NV AMD ) remain leading cause vision loss among people 65 . Intravitreal injection drug block VEGF , major protein mediator angiogenesis vascular leakage , revolutionize treatment NV AMD . However , less 40 % treated patient clinically significant improvement vision . Further , spite continuous monthly anti-VEGF therapy , 40-50 % patient demonstrate sustain persistent disease activity ( PDA ) , define ( 1 ) unresolved intraretinal , subretinal , sub-retinal pigment epithelium fluid ; ( 2 ) progressive lesion enlargement fibrosis ; and/or ( 3 ) persistent new hemorrhage , assess either load dose therapy sustain treatment anti-VEGF . Since affected patient increase risk long-term vision loss , PDA remain vital clinical unmet need . We interested relationship NV lesion morphology response therapy . Specifically , hypothesize specific NV morphologic subtypes frequently associate PDA , base preliminary retrospective analysis indocyanine green ( ICG ) image data NV AMD patient Duke Medical Retina practice . We observe eye Capillary pattern , see discrete homogenous focus microvessels , highly responsive anti-VEGF therapy rarely exhibit PDA ( &lt; 20 % case ) . In contrast , eye Arteriolar pattern ( large-caliber feeding artery , many branching arteriole , minimal capillary component ) eye polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy ( variably size number , discrete saccular dilation choroidal vasculature ) , demonstrate PDA 70 % case . A third subtype , choroidal leak syndrome , visible choroidal hyperpermeability leakage , manifest PDA 60 % case . These data suggest complex NV lesion morphology primary cause PDA , anti-VEGF therapy alone insufficient patient . However , relative frequency subtypes association PDA NV lesion morphology , treatment-naive population free selection bias , unknown . In study , determine relative frequency NV subtypes two group : ( ) representative , treatment-na√Øve NV AMD patient population , ( ii ) population patient develop recurrent NVAMD activity treatment ass frequency PDA accord specific NV morphologic subtypes . This information clarify scope PDA problem , identify patient PDA may benefit additional therapeutic strategy .</detailed_description>
