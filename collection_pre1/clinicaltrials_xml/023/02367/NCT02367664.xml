In order evaluate immunogenicity safety Vero cell-derived inactivated Japanese Encephalitis vaccine produce Shandong Hengye Biotech Co. , Ltd. single-centre phase III clinical trial plan conduct healthy infant age 6-11 month China . There two immunization program . 600 healthy infant age 6-11 month randomly assign ( 1:1 ) receive experimental vaccine positive control vaccine day 0,7 . Another 300 healthy infant age 6-11 month recruit receive experimental vaccine day 0,28 . All receive third dose booster vaccination 12 month later .</detailed_description>
