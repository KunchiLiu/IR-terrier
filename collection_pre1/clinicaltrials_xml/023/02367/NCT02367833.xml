	<detailed_description>This study preclinical , multi-site trial ( Penn State University Purdue University ) determine whether negative effect combine oral contraceptive ( COC ) therapy bone turnover dependent route administration attenuation effect observe comparable dose non-oral transdermal contraceptive ( TDC ) therapy contraceptive vaginal ring ( CVR ) therapy also test . Millions woman use COC therapy birth control purpose regulation menstrual cycle . TDC CVR therapy relatively new FDA-approved contraceptive alternative COC . The purpose propose project address potential mechanism ( ) oral ethinyl estradiol ( EE ) may negatively impair bone via `` first pas '' effect liver compare effect transdermally-administered vaginally-administered EE young woman . We assess mechanistic effect way 2-day serial sample insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-1 ) generation test . The IGF-1 generation test develop 20 year ago currently use diagnose growth hormone ( GH ) insensitivity . IGF-1 generation test may also use amplify effect observable assessment fast serial concentration systemic IGF-1 ( secrete liver ) associate bind protein . This study first study examine physiological mechanism whereby route estrogen administration affect GH/IGF-1 axis bone turnover young woman . The overall purpose study explore difference liver metabolism bone turnover oral versus transdermal vaginal contraceptive therapy . In effort expose route-dependent effect oral versus transdermal vaginal contraceptive therapy liver bone metabolism , examine effect ethinyl estradiol serially-assessed fasting concentration GH/IGF-1 axis bone turnover explore physiological mechanism underlie hepatic responsiveness oral versus transdermal vaginal contraceptive therapy use IGF-1 Generation Test probe .</detailed_description>
