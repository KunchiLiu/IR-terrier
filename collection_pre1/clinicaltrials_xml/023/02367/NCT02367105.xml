	<detailed_description>Obesity highly prevalent among Americans , even among Veterans use VA medical facility . Failure assist Veterans manage weight sedentary lifestyle affect current treatment increase future demand VA health care service . Decreased muscle mass age need carry extra mass due obesity make particularly difficult obese old Veterans function independently result frailty lead increased nursing home admission increase morbidity mortality . Data preliminary study show lifestyle therapy result weight loss understudied population improve physical function ameliorate frailty . However , improvement physical function modest best obese old adult remain physically frail . More importantly , concern lifestyle therapy may exacerbate underlie sarcopenia osteopenia weight loss- induced loss lean body mass bone mineral density ( BMD ) . As result , geriatrician reluctant recommend lifestyle therapy include weight loss obese frail elderly patient although combination weight loss exercise recommend part standard care obese patient general . Thus , surprise among Veterans , MOVE ( Managing Overweight/Obese Veterans ) program guideline eligible Veterans 70 old . In addition overeat lack exercise , age-related decline anabolic hormone ( i.e . testosterone ) may contribute sarcopenia osteopenia , turn exacerbate obesity . Indeed , preliminary study discover obese old men markedly low level serum testosterone baseline remain low throughout duration lifestyle therapy . Because testosterone replacement therapy show increase muscle mass BMD , therefore likely concomitant testosterone replacement lifestyle therapy obese old adult would preserve lean body mass BMD , reverse frailty . Accordingly , optimal management problem sarcopenic obesity frailty might require comprehensive approach combination lifestyle intervention correction anabolic hormone deficiency . Therefore , primary goal proposal conduct randomize , comparative efficacy , double-blind , placebo-controlled ( testosterone ) trial effect 1 ) lifestyle therapy ( 1 % diet-induced weight loss exercise training ) + testosterone replacement therapy versus 2 ) lifestyle therapy without testosterone replacement ( testosterone placebo ) obese ( BMI e 30 kg/m2 ) old ( age e 65 yr ) male Veterans . The investigator hypothesize 1 ) lifestyle therapy + testosterone replacement cause great improvement physical function lifestyle therapy without concomitant testosterone replacement ; 2 ) lifestyle therapy + testosterone replacement cause great preservation fat-free mass thigh muscle volume lifestyle therapy without testosterone replacement , 3 ) lifestyle therapy + testosterone replacement cause great preservation BMD bone quality lifestyle therapy without testosterone replacement , 4 ) lifestyle therapy + testosterone replacement cause great reduction intramuscular proinflammatory cytokine lifestyle therapy without testosterone replacement . The overarch hypothesis across aim multifactorial intervention mean lifestyle therapy plus testosterone replacement effective approach reverse sarcopenic obesity frailty obese old male adult , mediate additive effect suppress chronic inflammation , stimulate muscle bone anabolism . Obesity old adult , include many age Veterans , major public health problem . In fact , public health success occur recent year could danger lifestyle old adult neglect . The novel health outcome mechanistic-based data generate propose randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) important ramification standard care rapidly increase segment age Veteran population .</detailed_description>
