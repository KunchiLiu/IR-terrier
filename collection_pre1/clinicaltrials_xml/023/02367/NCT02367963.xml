	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease lead cause death Spain worldwide . Interventions target dietary pattern , weight reduction new physical activity habit often result impressive rate initial behavior change , frequently translate long term maintenance . We hypothesize peer-group intervention , address multiple facet cardiovascular disease risk factor successfully implement improve adherence participant healthy habit . A multicenter , randomize control trial scheme adopt . A peer-group base intervention approach community member support promote health-enhancing change choose . Around 600 participant 7 Spanish municipality receive 12h initial training randomly allocate intervention control group 12-month peer intervention . Baseline measurement take place initial training . Follow-up measurement take end intervention 1 2 year end study . The primary outcome improvement newly define score combine 5 individual variable . Secondary outcomes 1 , 2 3 year variation anthropometric parameter and/or healthy behavior . The project seek empowerment subject 25 50 year age improve overall health habit self-control risk factor peer education . The initiative develop cooperation Spanish Agency Consumer Affairs , Food Safety Nutrition ( AECOSAN ) . This study allow economic feasibility evaluation intervention , enable policy maker consider potential wider implementation real community-based intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease lead cause death Spain worldwide . Obesity , smoking , physical inactivity high blood pressure act major risk factor . Although major risk factor necessarily eliminate develop healthy habit behavior reduce possibility heart attack . The hypothesis project focus think adult train , among peer , provide new knowledge , skill attitude healthy lifestyle cardiovascular health self-control risk factor improve . The main objective comprehensive intervention explore evolution multiple cardiovascular disease , risk factor include blood pressure , body mass index ( BMI ) waist circumference . The project pilot study community intervention , multicenter , randomize , control longitudinal nature period 15 month , last intervention 12 month . Besides , project entail follow-up 2 year . The overall approach study follow : 1 . Recruitment : For participant recruitment , town council representative contact management team strategy design publicity project among town population . A representative town council design coordinator local municipality work close collaboration project team . Once potential subject identify , recruit meeting hold overall project objective present . 2 . Inclusion : Volunteers express interest participate program examine inclusion criterion . Eligible participant age 25-50 present least one follow cardiovascular risk factor and/or lifestyle-related risk factor : hypertension ( ≥140/90 ≤140/90 treatment ) , overweight obesity ( BMI ≥25 ) , smoke ( Smoker ) , physical inactivity ( ≤150min/week ) . Those acceptable included register program 's website . A detailed in-depth explanation program give select subject second meeting . Afterwards subject invite sign inform consent acknowledge program 's objective . 3 . Baseline Assessment ( A1 ) : physical annotation subject carry . Variables weight , height , waist perimeter blood pressure calculation BMI measure . Additionally information relate eat habit , smoking , physical activity , quality life , socio-demographic data collect use online questionnaire . All participant follow training period consist six workshops education health habit encouragement reduce risk factor promote . Workshops address rigorous , accurate effective technical information tailor general public ensure subject become aware importance change overall health . 4 . Assessment 2 ( A2 ) : two month workshop ' completion , contact detail reassure non-occurrence exclusion criterion confirm , repeat measure body weight , waist perimeter , blood pressure survey habit assess . After train period , attend workshop second assessment exclude study . The remain accepted participant randomize either control interventional group use sex stratification factor ensure group balance sex . To promote reduction cardiovascular disease risk , Fifty-Fifty program use evidenced-based recommendation cardiovascular disease prevention . The intervention design promote active participation subject healthcare . The ultimate goal program , specifically intervention , reinforce self-accountability subject nurture self-care . The approach health promotion peer education , community member support promote health-enhancing change among peer . The participant randomly assign subgroup intervention . The intervention initiate health , education psychology professional help recruit two volunteer subgroup serve peer educator leader . For select leader , subgroup go preset group-dynamics education direct expert psychologist , assess group member leadership , availability role clear understanding intervention . For prepare chosen leader peer educator , train 3-hour session relevant health health-promotion information , leadership communication skill . Twelve peer-group meeting hold monthly basis meeting last 60-90 minute . The activity involve group dynamic include , choice , group discussion , role-playing , brainstorming , relaxation technique , menu design , joint sportive activity , others . These activity directly stimulate incorporation healthy habit participant enhance confidence ability manage risk factor problem arise healthy habit . At meeting , participant address emotion management , problem resolution , relapse prevention , diet control physical activity engagement . Through reflection participant propose affordable goal improve life style . As fundamental instrument increase awareness healthy habit self-control cardiovascular disease risk factor , participant provide health handbook register health parameter record immediate goal group meeting . Progress new goal discuss context whole group . An important aspect program empower individual self- monitoring blood pressure . Blood pressure main target intervention directly relate healthy habit specifically target study . Automated blood pressure measure device donate participant use appropriate training use device provide . Through action participant directly control fundamental aspect cardiovascular disease risk . Due special relevance , specific blood pressure registry card provide follow participant blood pressure whole study . In addition , increase awareness situation evolution , participant receive copy score card objective evaluation cardiovascular disease risk factor determine . 5 . Assessment end 12-month intervention ( A3 ) : assessment carry upon 15-month duration study . Again contact detail reconfirm repeated measure body weight , waist perimeter , blood pressure survey habit collect . 6 . Assessment ( A4 ) : assessment carry one year intervention . 7 . Final assessment ( A5 ) : assessment carry two year intervention . Data obtain : 1 . Anthropometric data : blood pressure , weight , height waist circumference . 2 . Healthy habit collect standardized questionnaire 3 . Self-controlled blood pressure ( BP ) data also obtain intervention group . A frequency self-measures ( 2 per day —2 day per week — 2 week per month ) intend generate total 96 measure . Data registry : SHE Foundation own project database . It register Spanish Agency Data Protection name Fifty-Fifty Program . A responsible database coordinate management data arise study monitor quality control . Personal data introduce subject time registration . Once data include web application subject select research team , computer system send code password ensure anonymity assessment data arise study . If subject trouble access database information responsible facilitate his/her accessibility . The data physical assessment—weight , height , waist perimeter , blood pressure—will collect trained purpose , uploaded system ; , ensure high standard confidentiality security . The data collect verified responsible database . An essential part study data anonymization comply current regulation legislation . At moment subject enters study , system assign him/her identification ( ID ) number unique exclusive subject . Each subject 's visit record code associate his/her ID number . This guarantee information appear list anonymous credit specific individual . The processing data conform provision Organic Law 15/1999 , December , 13 , regard protection personal data . Access subject information restrict limited part staff involve study , always maintain absolute confidentiality thereof comply current legislation therefrom . The website database contain study information include data different exploration , survey information data progress score initial longitudinal phase study . The database centralize unique avoid redundancy inconsistency . The information contain database follow rigorous quality control . Ethical concern : Informed write consent participation require participant become part study . The write consent specifies purpose study intervention , test measure go take . Participants also notify withdrawal time immediate without consequence . We assure confidentiality data submit measure take participant . The information collect treated accord organic law 215/1999 protection personal data . Ethical approval receive committee reference . Statistical analysis : The percentage individual intervention control group substantially improve health habit estimate . Based power calculation , difference least 15 % intervention control group detect . Assuming approximate 10 % loss follow-up and/or refusal participate , minimum number subject need group detect change 250 participant . A descriptive analysis population base select variable carry baseline follow . The prevalence overweight , obesity , hypertension , smoking , physical inactivity adherence Mediterranean diet group sex age ( 25 34 35 50 year ) 3 assessment calculate . Total Fuster-BEWAT score ( combination 5 variable : blood pressure , exercise , weight , alimentation tobacco ) value compute . The percentages subject increase total score begin program completion determine . A comparison test proportion independent sample use assess whether significant change occur total score various dimension score , assume statistical significance value p &lt; 0.05 . Student 's t-test use ass whether average score end program significantly different intervention control group .</detailed_description>
