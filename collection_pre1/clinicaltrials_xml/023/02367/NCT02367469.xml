	<brief_summary>The main purpose study determine potential clinical utility PET image use radiotracer [ C-11 ] alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan diagnosis , differentiation monitoring various brain tumor , initial treatment . We also study mechanism clinical significance abnormal brain tumor tryptophan metabolism use resected tumor tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If agree take part research study , ask : 1. PET scan , 2. brief clinical questionnaire , 3. biochemical study blood tumor tissue . You may also second PET scan later , undergo therapy ( surgery and/or brain radiation ) , determine PET sign tumor . Your ability participate study base , part , result magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) medical chart earlier clinical procedure . Once receive result PET scan , compare MRI order help u analyze whether tryptophan uptake tell u anything type tumor brain . It take 3 hour complete PET scan ; include completion questionnaire , preparation scanning . The actual scanning time 70 minute . If female child-bearing age , need small urine sample start PET scan procedure make absolutely sure unknown pregnancy radiation exposure might harmful . 1 . The PET scan use measure accumulation inject radioactive tracer AMT brain . To make measurement accurate , use clinically obtain MRI scan ( ) , use diagnose tumor , identify exact location extent tumor . For PET scan , intravenous catheter ( small tube place vein ) insert injection AMT PET scan . It tracer PET scanner `` see '' perform scan . The amount tracer , give small ( 5 ml , volume teaspoon ) , therefore side effect expect tracer . A second intravenous catheter insert collect blood sample scan ; total le 2 teaspoon blood collect . Participants may sedate ( put sleep medicine ) unable remain still scan period . 2 . On day PET scan , ask fill brief clinical questionnaire , also additional multiple-choice questionnaire screen potential mood problem ( often coincide brain tumor ) . Participants potential speech ( comprehension ) problem also administer brief speech test . The goal test identify various clinical problem associate brain tumor affect abnormal tryptophan metabolism measure PET scan . 3 . If surgery remove tumor , portion remove tissue use biochemical study . The doctor remove tissue need care . The blood ( obtain PET scan ) tumor tissue ( obtain surgery ) process analysis store locked container freezer laboratory . In addition , review clinical pathology report , correlate PET result type grade tumor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Clinical MRI diagnosis intracranial lesion suspicious brain tumor , include primary metastatic tumor , possible residual recurrent brain tumor ( base clinical imaging ) ; history glioma treatment chemoradiation , even definite progression find clinical MRI . 2 . Age â‰¥13 year . 1 . Severe increase intracranial pressure , status epilepticus , symptom require emergency urgent intervention . 2 . Resective surgery within 2 month prior PET scan ( acute/subacute postsurgical inflammatory change may cause false positive increase AMT PET ) . 3 . Positive pregnancy test ( radiation involve PET scan ) .</criteria>
