	<brief_summary>Lifestyle modification include diet high fibre may lower risk develop type 2 diabetes ( CDA , 2013 ) . In context , presence soluble dietary fibre carbohydrate rich food widely recognize effect post-prandial glucose response ( PPGR ) . Among , oat barley derive β-glucan receive tremendous attention biological effect , include ability reduce PPGR wide variety food matrix ( Poppitt et al , 2007 ) . A health claim PPGR would increase market demand food grade barley , help want limit rise blood sugar meal choose product meet goal , several gap literature need fill submission Health Canada successful : 1 ) test food appropriate serve size ; 2 ) test glucose insulin response ; 3 ) include reference product match total fibre , macronutrient , energy profile ; 4 ) perform dose response . The propose study design address gaps current literature take consideration Health Canada 's guidance document health claim relate reduction PPGR , set criteria validity claim assess . Hypothesis : Barley β-glucan reduce PPGR healthy participant dose dependent manner . Specific objective : 1 . To determine minimum effective dose barley β-glucan quick bread PPGR insulin response cross-over , randomize , control clinical trial . 2 . To assess effect barley β-glucan quick bread appetite-related sensation use visual analog scale . 3 . To demonstrate whether test reference product like disliked similarly participant . 4 . To assess gastrointestinal side effect eat test product</brief_summary>
