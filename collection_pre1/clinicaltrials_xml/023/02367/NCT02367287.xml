	<brief_summary>Although diet US population meet exceed recommended intake level essential nutrient , quality diet consume many Americans sub-optimal due excessive intake add sugar , solid fat , refine grain , sodium . The foundation outcomes healthy vs. unhealthy eat habit activity level complex involve interaction environment innate physiologic/genetic background . For instance , emerge research implicate chronic acute stress response perturbation Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis trigger obesity-promoting metabolic change poor food choice . In addition , development many chronic disease , include cardiovascular disease , diabetes , cancer , asthma autoimmune disease , result overactive immune response host tissue environmental antigen ( e.g . inhaled allergen ) . A great understanding need distribution key environment-physiology interaction drive overconsumption , create positive energy balance , put health risk . Researchers USDA Western Human Nutrition Research Center seek volunteer study participant cross-sectional `` metabolic phenotyping '' study healthy people general population . Observational measurement include interaction habitual diet metabolic response food intake , production key hormone , conversion food energy : metabolism fat , protein , carbohydrate , characteristic immune system , stress response , gut microbiota ( bacteria intestinal tract ) , cardiovascular health . Most outcomes measure response mixed macronutrient/high fat challenge meal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many inflammatory response modulate specific dietary component . For example , cardiovascular disease , macrophages T-cells react oxidize LDL ( endogenous modify antigen ) produce arterial plaque subsequent blockage coronary artery . High intake saturate fat ( simple sugar drive synthesis saturate fatty acid ) may promote inflammation affect macrophage T-cells . Conversely , increase intake omega-3 fatty acid may decrease inflammation suppression macrophage T-cell pro-inflammatory activity . Long-term sub-clinical inflammation cause intestinal bacteria link development Irritable Bowel Disease relate disorder . Low intake fruit , vegetable , whole grain high intake saturate fat may promote sub-clinical gut inflammation promote dysbiosis gut microbiota . Allergic asthma develops predispose individual result overactive allergic-type immune response inhale environmental allergen . Dietary factor vitamin D omega-3 fatty acid may diminish pro-inflammatory response environmental allergen promote development T-regulatory cell anti-inflammatory factor . Individual variability chronic disease risk well recognize . For example , excess adiposity lead disease individual others ? The nature fat tissue rather abundance , may impact cross-talk metabolically-relevant tissue affect disease risk . It important characterize healthy vs. unhealthy phenotype across various tissue understand micro- macro-nutrients interact molecular metabolic pathway support healthy body weight . Our study bring together scientist expertise nutritional science , immunology , analytical chemistry , physiology , neuroendocrinology , behavior understand diet impact metabolism disease risk interplay coordination signal metabolites arise multiple organ system . The overall objective characterize phenotypic profile participant accord immunologic , physiologic , neuroendocrine , metabolic response dietary challenge physical fitness challenge address specific aim list . Specific Aim 1 : To determine diet quality independently associate systemic immune activation , inflammation , oxidative stress differentiate : 1. pro-inflammatory T-helper cell ( Th1 , Th2 , Th17 cell ) relate cytokine 2. anti-inflammatory T-regulatory cell relate cytokine 3. dysbiosis gut microbiota marker gut inflammation ( e.g . neopterin myeloperoxidase ) a. evaluate association dysbiosis gut microbiota , gut inflammation , systemic immune activation 4. plasma metabolomic response mixed macronutrient challenge meal ( include diet quality physical activity independent variable ) 5. endothelial ( dy ) function vascular reactivity Specific Aim 2 : To determine high fat/sugar challenge meal induce differential effect time ( 0-6h postprandial ) accord habitual diet characteristic , physical activity level , stress level , age , sex , BMI : 1. postprandial monocyte activation 2. plasma lipid metabolomic response include non-esterified fatty acid , phospholipid , triacylglycerols , red blood cell fatty acid , endocannabinoids , bile acid , eicosanoids relate oxylipins , ceramides , sphingoid base , acylcarnitines 3. plasma amino acid metabolomics 4. glucose metabolism metabolic flexibility ( i.e . ability switch glucose lipid oxidation energy source ) 5. change endocrinology self-report hunger satiety 6. postprandial free cortisol Specific Aim 3 : To determine mechanism : 1. postprandial monocyte activation 2. suppression challenge-meal induce monocyte activation docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) ( ex vivo experiment use subset sample ) Specific Aim 4 : To evaluate association eat behavior , physical activity , and/or anthropometry outcome : 1. endocrinology hunger satiety 2. plasma metabolomic responses 3. vulnerability resistance stress 4. endothelial ( dy ) function vascular reactivity 5. prediction insulin sensitivity</detailed_description>
