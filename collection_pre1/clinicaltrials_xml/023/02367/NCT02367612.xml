	<brief_summary>Respiratory gastrointestinal infection common child age 4 year , especially start school . These condition facilitate still incomplete functional maturation immune system anatomical structure function respiratory gastrointestinal tract still develop . The frequency duration condition involve high discomfort significant cost , relation medical appointment , take medication , need hospitalization , day absence school work day lose parent . Functional food derive fermentation cow 's milk probiotic strain propose prevention infectious disease child . Several product investigate , sometimes conflict result . Diversity experimental design , population evaluate , bacterial strain use preparation ferment product probably responsible discrepancy . Recently start study approve Ethics Committee Biomedical Activities `` Carlo Romano '' University Naples `` Federico II '' ( protocol number 210/12 ) evaluate effectiveness food ferment Lactobacillus paracasei CBA-L74 prevention common winter infection school child age 12 48 month . Studies pre-clinical phase show anti-inflammatory activity milk ferment strain Lactobacillus paracasei L74-CBA term stimulation production cytokine IL-10 decrease synthesis IL-12 , also response stimulation Salmonella typhimurium . The data obtain vitro study dendritic cell ex vivo intestinal biopsy well test healthy mouse mouse model experimental colitis . A preliminary analysis data find subject treat fermented milk show few infectious episode , well low incidence respiratory tract infection gastrointestinal , statistically significant difference study group . It also observe significant increase level α- β- defensins , LL-37 secretory IgA group subject treat fermented milk compare subject treat fermented rice placebo . Therefore , decide extend period study five additional month , order perform evaluation effectiveness ferment milk ( effective ) v placebo .</brief_summary>
