	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether copanlisib combination rituximab superior placebo combination rituximab prolong progression free survival ( PFS ) patient relapse iNHL receive one line treatment , include rituximab . Purpose study also evaluate safety tolerability copanlisib . Approximately 567 patient randomly assign blind treatment arm copanlisib plus rituximab placebo plus rituximab . Copanlisib administer Days 1 , 8 15 28-day cycle . Placebo dose administered day copanlisib . Rituximab dose administer weekly Cycle 1 Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 , Day 1 Cycles 3 , 5 , 7 9 . The maximum administration rituximab 8 time . Copanlisib placebo treatment continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , another criterion meet withdrawal study treatment . Following end treatment visit , patient enter either Safety follow-up Active follow-up period . The efficacy measure duration progression-free survival ( time randomization onset progression disease , death cause ) . Progression disease determine radiologic tumor assessment perform screening , well active follow period tumor assessment every 8 week Year 1 , every 12 week Year 2 , every 24 week Year 3 . Blood sample collect safety analysis pharmacokinetic analysis . Archival tumor tissue blood sample collect biomarker analysis central pathology review , fresh biopsy tissue bone marrow collect mandatory .</brief_summary>
