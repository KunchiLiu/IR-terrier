	<brief_title>A Randomized , Double-blind , Study Explore Effect GED-0301 Subjects With Active Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 51 subject randomize 1:1:1 ratio receive 1 3 treatment regimen 12-week Induction Phase : GED-0301 160 mg Once Daily ( QD ) 12 week GED-0301 160 mg Once Daily ( QD ) 8 week follow 4 week placebo GED-0301 160 mg Once Daily ( QD ) 4 week follow 8 week placebo Treatment assignment baseline stratify via Interactive Voice Response System ( IVRS ) /or Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ) base previous exposure TNF-α blocker ( yes/no ) disease location ( disease restrict terminal ileum and/or mid transverse colon , disease involve least 1 ulcerated segment distal mid transverse colon ) . The number subject previous exposure TNF-α blocker target approximately 40 % . The number subject disease involve distal mid transverse colon target comprise approximately 50 % study population . The study consist 5 phase : Screening Phase - 4 week Induction Phase - 12 week Eligible subject enter Induction Phase Baseline Visit ( Week 0/Induction Visit 1 ) . Subjects assign randomly receive IP described . At Induction Week 12 , subject ( responder ) achieve clinical remission , define CDAI score &lt; 150 , clinical response , define decrease baseline ≥ 100 point Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) score , follow Induction Visits ( Weeks 4 , 8 and/or Week 12 ) enter Observation Phase . The Observation Phase duration 52 week . Subjects unable achieve clinical remission clinical response ( responder ) follow Induction Visits ( Weeks 4 , 8 Week 12 ) , discontinue study . Subjects enter Observation Phase receive corticosteroid baseline start taper corticosteroid end Induction Phase ( Induction Week 12 ) . Observation Phase - 52 week Subjects enter Observation Phase evaluate CDAI score every 4 week . Subjects receive investigational product ( IP ) Observation Phase . Subjects experience partial loss response unable taper corticosteroid Observation Phase enter Extension Phase . Partial loss response define 2 consecutive visit CDAI score ≥ 150 increase CDAI score ≥ 50 point CDAI score visit subject first responder Induction Phase . Partial loss response must confirm 2 4 week post initial identification partial loss response . Subjects experience partial loss response Observation Week 52 end-of-study visit . Extension Phase -24 week Subjects enter Extension Phase receive GED-0301 40 mg QD 4-week , alternate dose schedule ( 4 week treatment GED-0301 , follow 4 week without GED-0301 treatment ) 24 week . Follow-up Phase - 4 week Subjects complete Extension Week 24 Visit 2 option : - Subjects Follow-up Visit choose enter Long-Term Extension Study initiate - Subjects may proceed Long-Term Extension Study , provide study initiated time subject complete study GED-0301-CD-001 subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion Long-Term Extension Study . Subjects prematurely discontinue study , reason , enter Follow-up Phase , 4-week period last study visit .</detailed_description>
