	<brief_summary>The trial randomize , double-blind First Human trial evaluate safety tolerability ZP4207 healthy volunteer ( HV ) insulin-induced hypoglycemic T1D ( type 1 diabetes ) subject compare native glucagon . The trial include two part . Part 1 include dose escalation ZP4207 cohorts 8 subject . In cohort , subject randomize 3:1 receive either single ascending dose ZP4207 ( 6 subject ) single fix dose ( SD ) native glucagon ( 2 subject ) . The dos administer s.c. 4-5 cohort i.m . 3 cohort . Part 2 include two sequence group 10 hypoglycemic T1D subject . The subject treat fixed single dos ZP4207 native glucagon s.c. sequential cross-over design randomize treatment order .</brief_summary>
