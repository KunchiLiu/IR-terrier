	<brief_summary>Pazopanib monotherapy approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , European Medicines Agency , regulatory authority worldwide treatment patient advance renal cell carcinoma patient advance soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) receive prior chemotherapy . Based improved progression-free survival sustain response observe pivotal Phase 3 , randomize , placebo-controlled study , hypothesize pazopanib may role maintenance set STS maintain initial response chemotherapy delay need treatment relapse associate toxicity impact health-related quality-of-life . This Phase 2 , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate maintenance therapy pazopanib versus placebo subject advance metastatic STS progress 4 6 cycle first-line anthracycline-based chemotherapy . Approximately 188 eligible subject randomize 1:1 ratio treatment pazopanib 800 milligram ( mg ) daily placebo . Study completion point 70 % randomized subject die . Once subject objective evidence disease progression , subject manage per standard practice physician . Subjects continue follow second progression , health relate quality life , survival study completion , withdrawal consent , early termination study .</brief_summary>
