	<brief_summary>Globally , cervical cancer second common cancer woman kill approximately 250,000 woman every year , annual number death expect increase 410,000 2030 . The majority ( 88 % ) death occur low- middle-income country ( LMICs ) screen prevention service limit . Prevention cervical cancer identification treatment cervical cancer precursor key , since treatment resource invasive disease scarce . A cervical cancer screen program effective unless link proven intervention prevent development cervical cancer . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recently release WHO guideline screen treatment precancerous lesion cervical cancer prevention , recommend screen-and-treat approach cervical cancer prevention , cryotherapy first choice treatment woman positive screen . However , program still slow implemented part due current high cost low efficiency cryotherapy equipment often prone break . Jhpiego , affiliate Johns Hopkins University , develop new cryotherapy device , CryoPop , one tenth cost current equipment also ten time efficient . Once proven safe , feasible effective , CryoPop could save ten thousand live low- middle-income country year prevent cervical cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recently release WHO guideline screen treatment precancerous lesion cervical cancer prevention23 recommend screenand- treat approach cervical cancer prevention ( CECAP ) , cryotherapy first choice treatment woman positive screen . Cryotherapy use nitrous oxide ( N2O ) carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) induce cryonecrosis dysplastic tissue follow regeneration normal cervical epithelium common intervention use LMICs simple safe enough mid-level provider nurse midwife operate , perform without anesthesia electricity . CO2 often use N2O due wider availability low cost . Mid-level provider train successfully perform cryotherapy safely high degree acceptability.24,25,26 Adverse effect cryotherapy relatively uncommon generally minor , report 1-2 % woman . A recent meta-analysis effectiveness cryotherapy find cure rate 85 % 92 % , respectively , CIN 2 CIN 3 . An alternative cryotherapy , loop electrosurgical excisional procedure ( LEEP ) largely supplanted cryotherapy well-resourced setting , provide surgical specimen pathologic assessment use large lesion ineligible cryotherapy . However , LEEP require electricity , costly , require high level training associate high rate complication , complicate routine use LMICs . While LEEP may available national referral center , WHO recommend cryotherapy setting available . Cost , reliability , durability reparability factor prohibit scale-up necessary current cryotherapy method match volume population-based screening need achieve mark decrease cervical cancer morbidity mortality . Each cryotherapy unit cost approximately $ 2,000 , result approximately 80 % treatment cost cryotherapy directly attribute equipment cost . Additionally , design involve many custom part available manufacturer , base U.S. Europe . This prohibit local repair limit life product one two year ( even less spare part available ) . Cryoguns initially develop use N2O use CO2 . CO2 approximately one fifth cost N2O ; however CO2 , various usage , recreational medical grade , less regulated often variable purity concentrationâ€”leading equipment failure . Last least , design equipment make inefficient use CO2 gas , increase cost miss opportunity gas cylinder refill central gas supply depot . In LMICs , mean send gas cylinder capital city . On average , single 50lb CO2 tank treat 10 15 woman . The subject proposal , CryoPop , new technology specifically design LMIC setting appropriate support see-and-treat effort low cost durability . The CryoPop device currently expect cost one tenth price current device also use one tenth CO2 supply , thereby substantially reduce purchase price couple far great efficiency use CO2 , make CryoPop attractive investment . Moreover , device design minimum move component time inexpensive replace easy repair in-situ provider . Finally , CryoPop tether gas canister procedure , add safely process concern tank gas line placement . The goal device frontline screen happen provide unique opportunity minimize preventing loss follow-up screen-positive woman . This accelerate access cervical cancer prevention treatment service enable implementation SVA rural , underdeveloped region , never CECAP program .</detailed_description>
