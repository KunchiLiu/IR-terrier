	<detailed_description>1 . Background Lung cancer common malignancy Poland . In 2013 , annual lung cancer incidence Poland 175/100 000 men 95/100 000 woman , substantially high EU value . Poland UK first country Europe , mortality lung cancer overtake mortality breast cancer become first cause mortality cancer woman . Thus besides problem prevention , efficient rational economical point view treatment lung cancer one crucial problem Polish healthcare system . Prolongation overall treatment time deleterious patient locally advance ( LA ) - non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) even radio-chemotherapy ( RT-CHT ) use . Current standard treatment LA-NSCLC concurrent radio-chemotherapy ( RT-CHT ) , survival benefit increase esophageal toxicity demonstrate meta-analysis . Acceleration radiotherapy ( RT ) via hyperfractionation result survival benefit show also meta-analysis expense high esophageal toxicity Hyperfractionated RT schedule use low-doses CHT , fear accumulation acute toxicity Hyperfractionation represent additional burden equipment , staff health care system routinely realize , especially limited .resources set . For patient , also associate high treatment cost , i.e . payment cost transport twice day . Alternative acceleration RT time use hypofractionated RT schedule . Such radiation schedule routine use country . However , hypofractionation often consider palliative approach even limit resource country still rarely propose curatively treated patient . In three 36 ( 8 % ) analyse Eastern Central European centre respond IAEA pattern care survey , hypofractionation use curative treatment LA-NSCLC . We also data prospective study report concomitant hypofractionated RTwith full dose CHT . The RTOG 0117 study arm use slightly hypofractionated RT schedule dose escalation ( 75.25 Gy 2.15 Gy fractional dose ) concomitant full-dose CHT interrupt excessive toxicity . However , total dose escalation use study might reason failure approach . Recently , concept dose escalation concomitant CHT compromise LA-NSCLC . When use hypofractionation , total radiation dose probably adapt correspond biological dos around 66 Gy , report confrm safety schedule . In opposite dose escalation use hypofractionation central tumor lead excessive long-term toxicity due bronchial tree stenosis perforation . In center Poland , hypofractionated RT total dose 58.8 Gy 21 fraction ( 4 week ; third week 6 fraction give ) follow two cycle CHT RT alone routinely use . Safety efficacy approach establish phase II prospective trial . A question arise RT schedule may use concurrently CHT . Given proven benefit concurrent RT- ( full dose ) CHT stage III NSCLC , data value overall treatment time order spare RT resource decide conduct phase I/II trial concomitant RT- ( full dose ) CHT use accelerated hypofractionation schedule currently routine use Poland sequential combination RT alone . Confirmation toxicity outcome term local control overall survival similar observe contemporary series conventionally fractionate RT-CHT lead incorporation schedule routine practice Poland . Such schedule shorten overall treatment time via hypofractionation contribute essential sparing RT resource , still insufficient Poland . Positive outcome study may also basis future conduction phase III study compare conventionally fractionate RT-CHT accelearated hypofractionated RT-CHT stage III NSCLC . 2 . Objectives study : To estimate toxicity efficacy accelerate hypofractionated RT combine concurrent full-dose CHT locally advance NSCLC . STUDY HYPOTHESIS : RTOG/EORTC grade III high esophageal pulmonary acute toxicity higher conventionally fractionate concurrent RT-CHT i.e . 25 % . And Two-year overall survival rate least 40 % median overall survival high 20 month . 2.1 . Main endpoint : A . To estimate rate RTOG/EORTC grade III high esophageal pulmonary toxicity grade IV high CTCAE version 3.0 hematological toxicity within 6 month start treatment . B . To estimate overall survival two year start RT-CHT . 2.2 . Secondary endpoint : A . Rate two-year local control . B . All type toxicity ( esophagus , lung , skin , kidney , heart ) within two year start RT-CHT . C. Feasibility study ( percentage completion plan cycle CHT full dose plan CHT delivery ; completion plan RT , break treatment prolongation overall treatment time ) . 3 .

Radiotherapy planning : CT plan do therapeutic patient 's position immobilization thoracic localization department . Scan thickness 3 mm . The i.v . contrast use plan mandatory . Dose prescribe ICRU point ; energy 6 ( exceptionally 15 ) MV photon use . Dose per fraction : 2.8 Gy , RT day , 5 time week 1st , 2nd 4th week RT ; 6 time week 3rd week RT ( treatment Saturday ) . Total dose : 58.8 Gy Dose homogeneity criterion : 95-107 % prescribed dose ; minimum dose 90 % also allow PTV ( point dose ) . Doses critical structure : Spinal cord : maximum dose - 45 Gy ; 40 Gy length &lt; 5 cm . Lung : mean dose ≤20 Gy ( less depend individual physician decision respiratory reserve patient limit ) ; 35 % total lung volume receive ≤20 Gy Heart : 50 % heart volume receive less 40 Gy ; avoidance hot-spot within organ Esophagus : recommend mean dose &lt; 34 Gy ; avoidance hot-spots within organ . 7.2 . Radiotherapy delivery : Physician present first RT session . The set-up verification KV portal do portal imaging therapeutic portal do fuse respective DRR first RT session . MV cone beam verification possible request physician , mandatory . Next KV set-up verification realize least weak . On-line off-line QA procedure wo n't differ curative treatment RT Department . 8 . Toxicity evaluation Early lung esophageal toxicity score accord RTOG/EORTC scale week radiotherapy , next one month completion RT , third sixth month treatment . During follow-up visit type toxicity organ , like skin , heart score accord scale [ 15 ] . Late radiation toxicity evaluate 6 month follow-up every three month within two year every six month thereafter accord RTOG/EORTC scale . Hematological toxicity evaluate accord CTCAE v 3.0 [ 17 ] interval esophageal pulmonary toxicity radiotherapy thereafter , often clinically indicate . Other type CHT toxicity also report accord CTCAE scale , occur . 9 . Evaluation outcome RT-CHT CT chest do one month treatment completion . Then CT chest well physical examination blood test do follow-up visit . Other radiological examination prescribe clinically indicate . Overall survival estimate accord Kaplan-Meier method calculate first day RT-CHT . Actual risk loco-regional failure also estimate use Kaplan-Meier method . Distant metastasis occurrence site score report . 10 . Number patient study duration Study conduct one institution . Ethic Committee agreement study conduction require . It plan include 100 patient first three year ; minimum follow-up require inclusion last patient one year . Thus plan time study conduction four year , meant time submission publication report outcome . Before , publication interim analysis allow judge clinically scientifically relevant investigator . 11 . Predefined rule study early halt termination Study earlier terminate appropriately modify Investigators Meeting consultation Ethical Committee : - After completion 6 month follow-up first 10 included patient , CTCAE hematological toxicity grade IV high occur 3 patient and/or grade III high RTOG/EORTC pulmonary esophageal toxicity occur 3 patient , also two toxic deaths* report . - After completion 6 month follow-up first 30 included patient , CTCAE hematological toxicity grade IV high occur ≥30 % patient and/or grade III high RTOG/EORTC pulmonary esophageal toxicity occur ≥30 % patient , also three toxic deaths* report . - Every toxic death lead extra meeting study investigator order ascertain immediate study modification necessary . Every death score unknown reason require undertaking necessary step find circumstance qualify high possible probability cause . 12 . Expected outcomes study We expect confirm prospectively safety efficacy study approach , meant esophageal pulmonary toxicity high overall survival lower observe contemporary series conventionally fractionated concurrent RT-CHT . After confirmation study hypothesis , phase III study compare study schedule conventionally fractionate RT-CHT justified . The studied accelerated hypofractionated RT-CHT schedule may become routine treatment protocol stage III NSCLC patient reduce treatment cost enable well spar accessible RT technological resource .</detailed_description>
