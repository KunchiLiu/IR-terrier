	<brief_summary>Rivaroxaban substance develop use treatment blood coagulation disorders.Thrombosis ( blood clot ) occur result excessive coagulation activity blood vessel . Excessive coagulation activity occur child well , rivaroxaban therefore develop treatment thromboembolic event child adolescent . As small child often unable swallow tablet , oral suspension ( mixture liquid contain finely distribute solid ) develop allows dose accord body weight.The objective trial compare bioavailability ( proportion substance remain available unchanged blood circulation ) new oral suspension rivaroxaban previously use oral suspension rivaroxaban tablet approve treatment . In order evaluate potential influence food , new oral suspension contain 20 mg rivaroxaban take consume food . In addition , pharmacokinetics ( concentration drug breakdown product ( metabolite ) blood ) , safety tolerability assess .</brief_summary>
