	<brief_summary>Background : - Ryanodine receptor type 1-related myopathy ( RYR1-RM ) common muscle disease people bear U.S . They affect development , muscle , walk . Researchers want test new drug help people disease . Objectives : - To see drug N-acetylcysteine decrease muscle damage people RYR1-RM . To see improves exercise tolerance . Eligibility : - People age 7 old confirm genetic diagnosis RYR1 clinical diagnosis RYR1 family member confirm genetic diagnosis . Design : - Participants screen checklist criterion . They muscle biopsy . A needle remove tiny piece muscle low leg . - Study visit take several day . - Visit 1 : - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood , urine , saliva test - Questions symptoms quality life - Heart , lung , walk test - Muscle Oxygenation Capacity Test . A blood pressure cuff around thigh tighten 10 minute . - Biodex testing , stretch leg resistance - Muscle ultrasound . A probe move skin . - Participants may photograph videotaped procedure . - They may muscle biopsy . - Six month later , visit 2 repeat visit 1 . Participants start take study drug dissolve water placebo three time day 6 month . - Participants stay NIH 2 day start study drug . - Participants keep online pill diary daily contact phone study . - Six month start study drug , study visit 3 repeat visit 1 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although genetic disorder muscle present birth rare , RYR1-related myopathy comprise common non-dystrophic congenital myopathy United States , prevalence approximately 1/90,000 people ( Amburgey et al , 2011 ) . Causative mutation ryanodine receptor gene skeletal muscle , RYR1 , find several myopathy subtypes , include central core disease centronuclear myopathy . These mutation result defective excitation-contraction coupling increase mitochondrial oxidative stress . Most patient present childhood delay motor milestone , extremity muscle weakness , impaired ambulation , joint contracture , progressive scoliosis , case eye movement paralysis , respiratory failure , susceptibility malignant hyperthermia , allelic condition . Despite important morbidity risk early mortality , treatment exist date . RYR1 encode homotetrameric transmembrane ion channel , RyR1 , reside terminal sarcoplasmic reticulum close proximity T-tubule . By release calcium sarcoplasmic reticulum cytosol response muscle fiber stimulation motor neuron neuromuscular junction , mediate excitation-contraction couple function regulator cellular calcium concentration redox homeostasis . Dowling et al . ( 2012 ) recently elucidate latter mechanism zebrafish patient myotubes , show RYR1 mutation result increase oxidative stress rescue model treatment N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , know anti-oxidant . NAC function precursor glutathione , endogenous antioxidant becomes deficient oxidative stress . This substantiate cystic fibrosis clinical trial low glutathione level neutrophil undergo oxidative stress significantly increase NAC administration . Dowling et al . ( 2012 ) find significant change post NAC treatment include increase travel distance ( endurance ) zebrafish complete protection cell death induce experimentally increase oxidative stress myotubes . Thus NAC successful treatment ex vivo vivo model system . Based result , plan perform randomize , double-blinded , placebo control clinical trial NAC subgroup RYR1-related myopathy patient , central core disease , first pathophysiologically base treatment devastate disorder . The objective study determine NAC reduces oxidative stress , fatigability , fatigue study population patient RYR1-RM . The study population include male females 7 year age old . The study design two phase . The first 6-month phase use validate select outcome measure RYR1 congenital myopathy . The second 6-month phase randomize , double-blinded , placebo control drug intervention trial . The primary outcome measure blood glutathione oxidative stress six minute walk test fatigability . Healthy volunteer evaluate determine normal value biomarkers , muscle ultrasound , near infrared spectroscopy rare disease , order develop comparison healthy RYR1-RM individual .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA PATIENTS : Have confirm genetic diagnosis RYR1related myopathy , include congenital myopathy , OR clinical diagnosis RYR1related myopathy family member confirm genetic diagnosis RYR1related myopathy . Ambulatory . 7 year age old . Preferred : The affected subject previous muscle biopsy available report confirm RYR1related myopathy histopathology . INCLUSION CRITERIA HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : Ages 7 older ( 1525 712 year old , 1525 1317 year old , 1525 1840 year old , 1525 41 old ) without medical condition result complaint muscle weakness and/or fatigue . The ability provide consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA PATIENTS : Adults provide consent pediatric participant parent able provide consent . Patients history liver disease ( Liver Function Tests collect baseline precautionary measure prior enrollment ) . Patients history peptic ulcer , gag reflex depression , esophageal varix . Patients severe pulmonary dysfunction ( FEV1 &lt; 40 % predict ) evidence pulmonary exacerbation . Pulmonary exacerbation refer acute worsen respiratory symptom result decline lung function . Participants may present increase coughing , increase dyspnea , increase haemoptysis , increase fatigue , decrease pulmonary function min 10 % , change sputum color . Pregnant breastfeed woman . Consumption antioxidant [ include NAC , GSH , melatonin , Immunocal ( Immunotac Research , VandreuilDorion , QC , Canada ) , Nacystelyn ( Galephar , Brussels ) ] 4 week recruitment . Daily use acetaminophen , nitroglycerine , carbamazepine past 7 day . Current use Angiotensinconverting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor Angiotensin Receptor Blockers ( ARBs ) . Patients ever use Beta2adrenergic agonist tablet , purpose increase muscle mass ( albuterol tablet ) . For muscle biopsy procedure ( second third visit , applicable ) : Patients take Aspirin , Ibuprofen , Advil , Motrin , Aleve within 3 day prior muscle biopsy procedure , and/or patient take Plavix , fresh garlic , gingko , ginseng 5 day prior muscle biopsy . Participation trial therapeutic investigational drug simultaneously 4 week recruitment . EXCLUSION CRITERIA HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : Diagnosis RYR1related myopathy neurological disorder ( neurological exam , genetic testing , muscle biopsy Complaints fatigue weakness Consumption antioxidant [ include NAC , GSH , melatonin , Immunocal ( Immunotac Research , VandreuilDorion , QC , Canada ) , Nacystelyn ( Galephar , Brussels ) ] 4 week recruitment . Use Beta2adrenergic agonist .</criteria>
