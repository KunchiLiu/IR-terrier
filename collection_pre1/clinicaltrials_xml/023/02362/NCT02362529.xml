	<detailed_description>There three Phases study . Only MDE subject invite continue Phase 2 3 . Subjects invite continue subsequent Phase give meet entry criterion describe : Phase 1 : The investigator evaluate whether TSPO elevate individual current MDE compare healthy control . Eligible participant receive one [ 18F ] FEPPA PET scan one MRI scan . Other measure include urine sample , blood sample genetic peripheral biomarker analysis , neurocognitive battery , mood scale questionnaire . Phase 2 : Participants elevate TSPO VT Phase 1 agreeable receive minocycline invite participate Phase 2 . Based previous result participant consider candidate Phase 2 TSPO VT ≥ 10.5 ( HAB ) ≥8.5 ( MAB ) primary region interest ( prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate cortex insula ) . Eligible participant invite participate randomize , double blind , placebo control trial , receive either minocycline placebo . After eight week treatment , participant receive one [ 18F ] FEPPA PET scan . Other measure include urine sample , blood sample , mood scale questionnaire . Phase 3 : If , initial eight week treatment period either minocycline placebo , participant continue depressive symptom ( 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score ≥ 8 ) invite participate eight week open label trial celecoxib .
