	<brief_title>A Study Assess Safety HIV Hep C Vaccine Candidates When Given Separately Combination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C HIV widespread pathogen . By end 2010 , 2.3 million people Europe live HIV , half coinfected Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . Although vaccination optimal method prevent infection , prove extremely difficult develop effective vaccine HIV HCV due enormous variation strain around world . This cause extraordinary ability virus change genetic material . Researchers University Oxford develop novel candidate vaccine HIV ( 'HIV.consv ' ) HCV ( 'NSmut ' ) . These vaccine insert carrier virus Chimpanzee Adenovirus ( ChAd AdCh ) modify vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) , excellent safety record . The aim study test first time response immune system vaccine HIV HCV give together . During study , 32 healthy adult age 18 50 year recruit one three group receive either two four intramuscular injection period two month . All participant follow six month ( 12 visit total ) .</detailed_description>
