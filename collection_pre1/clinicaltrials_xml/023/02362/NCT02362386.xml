	<brief_title>Feasibility Obtaining ADRCs From Discarded Thermal Burn Eschar Tissue Using Investigational Celution® System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study non-interventional clinical study . Adipose tissue excise part usual care burn wound would otherwise discard collected processing analysis . Target population include patient burn injury require surgery fat excision approximately 100 g ( ) anticipate . The scope study include : - Fat tissue collect tangential fascial excision manually prepared processing within investigational Celution® System - Adipose tissue process use investigational Celution® System . ADRC yield viability evaluate use NucleoCounter® device - Age , gender , weight , height , location/severity/ % TBSA burn , time/date burn injury , current stage health collect - Operational detail start stop time tissue excision , adipose tissue preparation Celution® processing , cell count dose preparation collect . In addition , weight excise tissue prior preparation , weight adipose tissue process Celution Device ADRC yield viability record . - Several sample collect sent central microbiology laboratory microbiological testing .</detailed_description>
