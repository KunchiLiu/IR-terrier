	<detailed_description>Some study demonstrate even trastuzumab pretreated patient HER-2 positive breast cancer , might benefit treatment trastuzumab . However , small benefit patient short disease-free survival adjuvant trastuzumab short progression-free survival first-line trastuzumab-based therapy . In clinical practice , investigator also find fact . And investigator scientific rationale clinical test lapatinib plus chemotherapy patient trastuzumab-refractory , metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer .</detailed_description>
