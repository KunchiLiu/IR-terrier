	<brief_title>Investigating Novel Treatments Concussion : Impact Compression Vest Rehabilitation Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) , concussion , induces significant impairment patient 's mobility tolerance daily living activity symptoms include decreased balance , dizziness , confusion , headache , visual auditory sensitivity . If recognize promptly , many injury respond well immediate rest standard rehabilitation strategy . However , approximately 10-30 % patient experience persistent symptom beyond ~2 week period spontaneous healing . The persistent symptom point neural damage , disrupt neural network brain , actual mechanism nature neural damage remain elucidate . The brain 's neural activity must support rapid adjustment , optimal distribution , blood flow . However , cerebrovascular control remain poorly study context persistent concussion symptom , particularly reactivity element flow control fast recovers drop blood pressure one stand sit posture . Cerebrovascular damage mTBI appear affect mostly autoregulatory adjustment change brain perfusion pressure ( i.e. , lie stand ) ( Len et al. , 2013 ; Junger et al. , 1997 ) . The investigator study impact mTBI acute persistent stage cerebrovascular adjustment metabolic pressure-dependent stimulus . Currently , decision regard rate completeness heal remain subjective lead earlier-than-optimal return patient inappropriate level activity , work school . Improved cost-effective marker rate completeness brain healing need obtain clinic . One challenge might emphasis previous investigation search single biomarker damage highly integrated system . Rather , investigator believe may effective employ holistic perspective ; focus comprehensive neural outcome might provide enhance insight severity damage rate completion recovery . Previously , several investigator establish heart rate variability ( HRV ) sensitive marker abnormal brain function TBI ( traumatic brain injury ) case adult child ( Goldstein et al. , 1998 ; Goldstein et al. , 1996 ) . Moreover , study imply autonomic nervous system control heart rate disrupt proportion degree neurologic insult . Thus , heart rate power spectral analysis may prove useful adjunct determine severity neurologic injury prognosis recovery . Despite many study outline relationship mTBI HRV ( Ryan et al. , 2011 ; Goldstein et al. , 1998 ; Goldstein et al. , 1996 ; Papaioannou et al. , 2008 ; La Fountaine et al. , 2009 ) follow-up research conduct establish method ( cost-effective , non-invasive , comprehensive easily-obtained ) routine assessment TBI severity , rehabilitative efficacy . An additional neural network associate cardiac function baroreflex sensitivity neural network ( baroreflex sensitivity ; BRS ) study non-invasive measure heart rate blood pressure . In past currently lab use method HRV BRS safely effectively ( Zamir et al. , 2013 ; Kiviniemi et al. , 2010 ; Kiviniemi et al. , 2011 ; Shoemaker et al. , 2012 ) . This current study assess feasibility impact routine measurement cardiac dynamic sensitive marker severity persistence `` overall '' brain damage mTBI patient . Based 30 fail clinical trial , single pharmacological agent prescribe minimize TBI-induced brain damage , despite efficacy show several agent rodent study ( see ( Kabadi &amp; Faden , 2014 ) review ) . In contrast , non-pharmacological approach rodent , show pathophysiological change neurological impairment experimental TBI attenuate physical activity ( Griesbach et al. , 2004 ; Griesbach et al. , 2009 ) . Thus , value consider application `` appropriate '' exercise soon possible mTBI patient , soon value exercise rodent model observe applied acute stage ( Griesbach et al. , 2007 ; Piao et al. , 2013 ) . Therefore , study also examine impact add prescriptive exercise addition usual clinical care rate concussion recovery . Enabling patient receive benefit enhance level physical activity treatment concussion may limit concussion symptom . Nonetheless , recent anecdotal evidence Parkwood group illustrate remarkable benefit many patient persistent symptom provide wear compression vest ( HSREB # 103325 # 104865 ) . Briefly , weight compression vest ( 5 % individual 's body mass ) individualize fit subject ensure snug impede one 's respiration ( similar bulletproof vest ) . The noted benefit compression vest include instant improvement balance gait , reduce anxiety stair climb . Since adaptive method treatment appear exert powerful effect enhance patient 's ability perform exercise , consistent personalize medicine approach ( like exercise intervention ) , investigation effect compression vest concussion symptom rehabilitation viable area research . To date impact compression vest intervention yet examine patient acute TBI phase young individual . Thus , aim next phase study establish whether intervention weight compression vest enhance exercise tolerance patient acute persistent phase TBI , exploration possible mechanistic link cerebrovascular , cardiovascular neural outcome . If , new evidence support use compression vest could change clinical practice , importantly , improve long-term health outcome many patient . In review , purpose investigation determine efficacy novel method mild traumatic brain injury rehabilitation addition usual concussion rehabilitation program . Concussed participant complete longitudinal study randomly allocate one three rehabilitation group : 1 ) usual care 2 ) usual care + exercise 3 ) usual care + exercise + compression vest . The efficacy rehabilitation group primarily quantify via change routine cardiac dynamic measurement ( HRV , BRS , change blood flow change posture ) .</detailed_description>
