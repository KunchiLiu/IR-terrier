	<brief_summary>Current opinion regard use steroid treatment chronic subdural hematoma mostly base observational study . Here present data prospective randomize pilot study twenty chronic subdural hematoma ( CSDH ) patient treat dexamethasone placebo 30 day . Twenty patient compute tomography ( CT ) - magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -confirmed CSDH recruit single center randomize order receive dexamethasone placebo conservative treatment . Patients affect treatment group receive oral dexamethasone 12mg/day three week follow taper . These patient follow 6 month rate success conservative treatment versus placebo measure . Parameters hematoma thickness global impression change also compare treatment chi-square test . Adverse event complication document .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Dexamethasone Conservative Treatment Chronic Subdural Hematoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Recruitment single-center double-blind randomize placebo-controlled study perform January 2007 May 2009 . Patients enrol base follow inclusion criterion : 18 year old evidence subacute chronic supratentorial subdural hematoma CT ( computerized tomography ) scan MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) classify 0 2 use Markwalder grade scale ( 17 ) ( Grade 0 normal neurological status , grade 1 neurological deficit mild symptom , grade 2 focal variable neurological deficit , grade 3 several focal neurological sign , grade 4 comatose ) . Exclusion criterion include contraindication intolerance corticosteroid therapy patient already undergo steroid treatment indication , previous neurological surgery one year prior consider study , concomitant cerebral pathology neoplastic presume infectious origin , anticoagulant therapy could stop 6 month refusal participate study . If time , patient develop sudden increase hematoma volume , midline displacement great 1cm deterioration level consciousness , remove conservative study protocol order undergo surgery . This study approve research ethic board Centre Hospitalier Universitaire ( CHU ) de Quebec . Written fully inform consent obtain participant . Randomization Allocation group do 1:1 ratio block size range 4 6 , one two arm ; treatment arm participant receive dexamethasone accord protocol , control group receive placebo . Randomization perform via web-based service pharmacist , involve part study . Both investigator participant blind treatment allocation . Treatment Participants allocate treatment group receive daily dosage 12mg ( 4mg three time day ) dexamethasone three week . Corticosteroid treatment taper next week ( 8mg 48 hr , 4mg 48 hr , 2mg 48 hr 1mg 24 hr ) . Identical oral capsule fill lactose administer control ( placebo ) group 28 day . Participants return home blister pack contain medication day trial ask return empty pack ensure compliance assign treatment . The treatment ( placebo dexamethasone ) discontinue patient require surgical drainage hematoma suffer significant side effect . Evaluation follow-up The primary outcome pilot study determine efficacy dexamethasone compare placebo reduce rate surgical intervention CSDH grade 0 2 Markwalder grade scale ( Grade 0 normal neurological status , grade 1 neurological deficit mild symptom , grade 2 focal variable neurological deficit , grade 3 several focal neurological sign , grade 4 comatose ) . Eligible patient consent study underwent routine standard care . This include 1 ) complete medical history review neurological physical exam ; 2 ) head computerize tomography ( CT ) MRI measurement maximal hematoma thickness ( mm ) , midline shift ; 3 ) check blood vital parameter . In addition , patient ask complete detailed questionnaire measure symptom typically associated subdural hematoma . Follow-up appointment schedule 2 week , 1 , 2 6 month initiation treatment . At visit , three component clinical evaluation describe repeat . Moreover , seven point categorical scale use evaluate patient 's global impression change relative initial state ( unchanged , much improve , much improve , minimally improve , minimally bad , much bad , much bad ) . Treatment-related side effect also inquire collect . The rate success conservative management define percentage patient require surgery treatment group 6 month follow enrollment . Radiological progression hematoma term thickness magnitude midline shift , hematoma-related symptom medication-related side effect carefully collect . Statistical analysis Demographical characteristic , baseline neurological status hematoma size location compare group use Mann-Whitney test continuous variable χ2 test categorical variable . To compare rate success , categorical frequency comparison Fisher 's exact test use . For outcome measure use Mann-Whitney U test Student 's t-test normally distribute variable χ2 Fisher 's exact test categorical frequency . All statistical test do Statistical package Social Sciences software version 16.0 significance threshold set p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
