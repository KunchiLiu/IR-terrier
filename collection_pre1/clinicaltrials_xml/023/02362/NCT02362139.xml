	<detailed_description>Cervical dilatation rate duration delivery key issue management labor . Protracted labor know associated range potential maternal neonatal complication , include high rate post partum hemorrhage ( PPH ) , cesarean section , instrumental delivery , maternal neonatal infection neonatal pulmonary asphyxia [ 1,2,3 ] . Thus , rationale reduce duration labor order reduce adverse pregnancy outcome . Active management labor demonstrate O'driscoll et al . find effective shorten duration delivery [ 1 , 4 ] . There variety mechanical medical method labor induction augmentation . Mechanical method include artificial rupture membrane ( amniotomy ) , without use Pitocin [ 5 , 6 ] , manual sweeping amniotic membrane promotes release prostaglandins [ 7 ] , extra-amniotic balloon [ 8 ] . Medical method prostaglandins Pitocin well study find reduce duration labor . Papaverine derivative study ninety last century find effective reduce duration first stage labor [ 9 , 10 , 11 ] . Drotaverine hydrochloride analog Papaverine selective inhibitor phosphodiesterase 4 . It find effective accelerate cervical dilatation smooth muscle relaxation . In prospective randomize controlled trial include 146 woman spontaneous vaginal delivery , Madhu et al . show woman treat Drotaverine latent phase labor , significantly short duration time administration medication delivery fetus , compare woman treat placebo ( 182 minute compare 245 minute placebo ) . Moreover , cervical dilatation rate Drotaverine group significantly high placebo group ( 3 centimeter per hour ( cm\Hr ) compare 1.4 cm\Hr ) [ 9 ] . These finding agreement Shmara et al . also demonstrate significant reduction duration labor significant acceleration cervical dilatation rate Drotaverine administration compare placebo . In study 100 % woman treat Drotaverine latent phase labor deliver 6 hour administration , compare 46 % placebo group [ 10 ] . Only previous study address influence Papaverine administration duration labor [ 9-12 ] , study limit small sample size , different administration protocol . Moreover , part study , use Papaverine separate use method labor augmentation amniotomy Pitocin administration , could bias result . In investigator institution , wide use Papaverine delivery room , use optional , left discretion physician . The aim investigator study prospectively evaluate influence Papaverine administration latent phase labor , duration labor .</detailed_description>
