	<brief_summary>Background : - Men continue elevate rise prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level primary prostate cancer treatment increase risk cancer progress . The time take progress highly variable . One way predict progression base change PSA level time . This call PSA double time ( PSADT ) . Researchers want test vaccine men Stage D0 prostate cancer . Stage D0 mean PSA become detectable start rise primary treatment , spread organ . Objectives : - To test vaccine effectiveness rate PSA increase use PSADT tumor growth rate . Eligibility : - Men Stage D0 prostate cancer PSADT 3 15 month . Design : - Participants screen blood test , scan , physical exam , medical history . Their prostate cancer confirm . - Participants undergo apheresis . Blood remove needle one arm . A machine separate white blood cell . The blood , minus white cell , return needle arm . - Participants 14 visit . At visit , physical exam blood test . They discuss side effect . - Participants get injection either vaccine placebo week 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 24 . Both make participant cell . - Participants select randomly receive either active vaccine placebo . For every two participant assign active vaccine , one participant assign placebo vaccine . - Participants get Vaccine Report Card complete receive vaccine . - The study last 96 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-Epitope TARP Peptide Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccination Men With Stage D0 Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TARP - T-cell receptor g alternate reading frame protein ( TARP ) 58 amino acid protein express normal malignant prostate cancer tissue ; 95 % prostate cancer specimens positive TARP expression . TARP highly express prostate cancer Gleason type , primary well metastatic disease , hormone sensitive castrate resistant prostate cancer . Therefore , TARP ideal tumor antigen target vaccine . - A prospective , randomize pilot study 1st generation TARP Peptide vaccination ( NCI 09-C-0139 ) utilize TARP WT 27-35 EE29-37-9V peptide conduct HLA-A 0201positive men stage D0 prostate cancer ( PSA biochemical recurrence ) PSA double time ( PSADT ) great equal 3 month less equal 15 month . TARP vaccination find immunogenic , safe well tolerate , adverse event limited injection site reaction less equal Grade 2 . TARP vaccination also associate decrease slope log PSA compare pre-vaccination baseline 72 % subject reach 24 week 74 % reach 48 week ( p=0.0012 p=0.0004 overall change slope log PSA , respectively ) ; TARP vaccination also result 50 % decrease calculate tumor growth rate constant : pre-vaccine g = 0.0042/day , post-vaccine g = 0.0021/day ( p=0.003 ) ; TARP-specific IFN-g ELISPOT response detect majority subject correlate decrease slope log ( PSA ) . Multi-Epitope ( ME ) TARP Vaccine - The vaccine platform include original two 9-mer HLA-A*0201 binding TARP peptide epitope ( WT27-35 EE29-37-9V ) utilize NCI 09-C-0139 well additional five 20-mer TARP peptide overlap 10 amino acid total 7 peptide span amino acid sequence entire TARP protein . - The advantage multi-epitope TARP peptide vaccine platform overlap epitope cover entire TARP protein , result potential induction multi-valent anti-TARP response . In addition , longer synthetic peptide include TARP-specific MHC class II CD4+ T cell helper epitopes allow generation well CD8+ T cell response improve functional avidity longevity well humoral anti-TARP antibody response . Study Objectives : Primary : -To ass difference slope log ( PSA ) Weeks3-24 minus form 12 month prior enrollment study ( refer slope324 pre-slope ) well slope log ( PSA ) week 3-48 versus pre-treatment slope log ( PSA ) ( refer slope 348 preslope ) patient na ( SqrRoot ) TARP vaccination receive active , multi-epitope TARP vaccination vs. placebo . Eligibility : - Males great equal 18 year age histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate . - Stage D0 disease document biochemical progression document rise PSA evidence metastatic disease physical examination , CT scan bone scan . - PSADT great equal 3 month less equal 15 month : -- -- Patients must great equal 3 PSA measurement great equal 3 month . -- - The interval PSA measurement must great equal 4 week . - Performance Status : ECOG 0-1 life expectancy great equal 1 year . - No concurrent anticancer therapy prior prostate cancer vaccine express TARP . Study Design : - Phase II , prospective , single-blinded , randomize , placebo control study 96 week duration men Stage D0 prostate cancer . Men PSADT great equal 3 month less equal 15 month randomize 2:1 receive ME TARP autologous DC vaccination control eleutriated monocyte vaccine placebo . - An initial lead-in 6 patientswill enrol allow preliminary assessment safety ME TARP vaccine platform 12 week enrollment prospectively randomized subject blind treatment assignment begin . - All patient receive total 6 dos vaccine ( 20 x10 ( 6 ) viable cells/dose ) deliver intradermally Weeks 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 24 . All patient undergo 15-18L apheresis Week 0 restaging Weeks 48 96 confirm maintenance Stage D0 disease . Sample size : N = 72 ( 6 lead-in patient safety assessment , 2:1 randomization : TARP N = 44 ; placebo N =22 ) .</detailed_description>
