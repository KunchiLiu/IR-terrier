	<brief_summary>The purpose observational registry compare safety efficacy antithrombotic regimen comprise one single antiplatelet agent plus oral anti-thrombotic versus consist DAPT alone DAPT plus oral antithrombotic therapy . This registry ass whether antithrombotic therapy intensity vary positively physician perceive ischemic risk time percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , whether inverse association observe perceived bleeding risk . This study also evaluate physician use objective benefit-risk assessment score influence prescription antithrombotic therapy atrial fibrillation ( AF ) patient undergo PCI . Additionally study investigate whether patient perceive relevance accessibility anti-platelet anticoagulant treatment regiment predict treatment adherence whether non-adherence independently influence outcome . Approximately 2500 subject non-valvular AF undergo all-comer PCI stenting enrol North America Europe , sit determined . Follow-up do via telephone train research coordinator participate site 30 day , 6 month 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antithrombotic Strategy Variability In ATrial Fibrillation Obstructive Coronary Disease Revascularized With PCI - The AVIATOR 2 Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current AHA guideline AF patient undergo PCI non-specific recommend `` low-dose aspirin ( le 100 mg per ) and/or clopidogrel ( 75 mg per ) , may give concurrently anticoagulation prevent myocardial ischemic event , strategy thoroughly evaluate associate increase risk bleeding . Finding right balance minimizes bleed risk maintains anti-ischemic efficacy remain complex controversial clinical dilemma unique patient . The arrival novel antiplatelet agent antithrombotics scene lead exponential increase combination may employ clinician real-life situation . The sheer number combination mean best APT OAC combination base RCT data know many year . It therefore become imperative investigator strive create well method gauge comparative safety efficacy various antiplatelet antithrombotic combination strategy AF patient undergo PCI . To best investigator knowledge , contemporary prospective registry real-life patient AF undergo PCI exists initiate date . Additionally , factor influence physician choice treatment strategy well factor predict patient adherence population largely unknown . This multi-center , multinational , observational prospective registry prospective analysis 2500 patient non-valvular AF undergo all-comer PCI stenting 50 Northern American European center . Patients follow 12 month follow implantation stent . Data collect prospectively . All-antiplatelet anti-thrombotic treatment regimen physician ' discretion . The investigator study various combination antiplatelet antithrombotic therapy , characterize bleed ischemic risk patient atrial fibrillation undergo PCI determine physician patient center factor influence prescription pattern patient adherence . Patients non-valvular atrial fibrillation undergone successful PCI enrol soon possible post procedure later discharge index admission . The treat physician ( interventional non-interventional cardiologist ) prescribe anti-platelet or/and anticoagulant therapy must complete physician questionnaire . A different , patient center questionnaire complete patient . The Principal Investigator designee provide instruction enrol subject physician use hand hold electronic device complete paper questionnaire clarify question questionnaire . The enrolled subject physicians enter response questionnaire electronic hand hold device paper questionnaire . Only patient complete questionnaire consider enrolled . Treatment accord physician .</detailed_description>
