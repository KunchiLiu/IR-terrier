	<brief_summary>Background : - Few study literature available long-term safety repeat peptide vaccination people period time . Long-term vaccination may need control tumor . Researchers give group men series vaccine injection 2 year . Now want give men new version vaccine . They want see produce different type immune response also ensure repeated vaccination safe . &lt; TAB &gt; Objectives : - To find long-term safety repeat TARP peptide vaccination . Eligibility : - Men take part NCI protocol 09-C-0139 . Design : - Participants screen blood test , scan , physical exam , medical history , evaluation well perform everyday activity . - Participants apheresis . Blood remove needle one arm . A machine separate white blood cell . The blood , minus white cell , return needle arm . - Participants 14 visit . At visit , physical exam blood test . They discuss side effect . - Participants get vaccine injection week 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 24 . The vaccine make participant cell . - Participants get Vaccine Report Card complete receive vaccine . - The study last 96 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TARP - T-cell receptor &gt; = alternate reading frame protein ( TARP ) amino acid protein express normal malignant prostate cancer tissue ; 95 % prostate cancer specimens positive TARP expression . TARP highly express prostate cancer Gleason type , primary well metastatic disease , hormone sensitive castrate resistant prostate cancer . Therefore , TARP ideal tumor antigen target vaccine . - A prospective , randomize pilot study 1st generation TARP Peptide vaccination ( NCI 09-C- 0139 ) utilize TARP WT 27-35 EE29-37-9V peptide conduct HLAA* 0201positive men stage D0 prostate cancer ( PSA biochemical recurrence ) PSA double time ( PSADT ) great equal 3 month less equal 15 month . TARP vaccination find immunogenic , safe well tolerate , adverse event limited injection site reaction less equal Grade 2 . TARP vaccination also associate decrease slope log PSA compare pre-vaccination baseline 72 % subject reach 24 week 74 % reach 48 week ( p=0.0012 p=0.0004 overall change slope log PSA , respectively ) ; TARP vaccination also result 50 % decrease calculate tumor growth rate constant : prevaccine g = 0.0042/day , post-vaccine g = 0.0021/day ( p=0.003 ) ; TARP-specific IFN- &gt; = ELISPOT response detect majority subject correlate decrease slope log ( PSA ) . Multi-Epitope ( ME ) TARP Vaccine - The vaccine platform include original two 9-mer HLA-A*0201 binding TARP peptide epitope ( WT27-35 EE29-37-9V ) utilize NCI 09-C-0139 well additional five 20-mer TARP peptide overlap 10 amino acid total 7 peptide span amino acid sequence entire TARP protein . - The advantage multi-epitope TARP peptide vaccine platform overlap epitope cover entire TARP protein , result potential induction multi-valent anti-TARP response . In addition , longer synthetic peptide include TARP-specific MHC class II CD4+ T cell helper epitopes allow generation well CD8+ T cell response improve functional avidity longevity well humoral anti-TARP antibody response . Study Objectives Primary Objective : -To ass long-term safety repeat TARP peptide vaccination follow use 1st generation bivalent ( 09-C-0139 ) 2nd generation ME TARP peptide vaccine . Specifically , document le 10 % enrolled patient experience vaccine-related Grade 3 adverse event ( local injection site reaction systemic reaction ) . Eligibility Criteria All Patients - Males great equal 18 year age histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate . - Prior enrollment NCI protocol 09-C-0139 receipt least 5 dos TARP peptide vaccine ( i.e . completion primary vaccination series ) . - Performance Status : ECOG 0-1 life expectancy great equal 1 year . - Hemoglobin great equal 10.0 gm/dL , WBC great equal 2,500/mm3 , ALC great equal 500/ mm3 , ANC great equal 1,000/mm3 , platelet count great equal 100,000/mm3 , PT/PTT le equal 1.5X ULN unless receive clinically indicate anticoagulant therapy ; SGPT/SGOT le equal 2.5X ULN , total bilirubin less equal 1.5X ULN ; creatinine le equal 1.5X ULN estimate GFR ( eGFR ) great equal 60 ml/min . - Hepatitis B C negative ( unless result consistent prior vaccination prior infection full recovery ) ; HIV negative . - No use investigational agent within 4 week study enrollment use immunosuppressive immunomodulating agent within 8 week study entry . - Standard care medical management current prostate cancer disease status patient local oncologist e.g . androgen deprivation therapy allow . - Must able/willing adhere protocol requirement vaccination timeline . Exclusion Criteria All Patients - Patients active infection significant uncontrolled medical illness . Patients remote history asthma active mild asthma may participate . - Patients immunosuppressive therapy include systemic corticosteroid therapy reason . Patients receive inhaled topical corticosteroid may participate . - Patients , opinion Principal Investigator , significant medical psychosocial problem warrant exclusion . Study Design - Open label , prospective , non-randomized , long-term follow-up pilot study 96 week assess long-term safety repeat TARP vaccination patient already receive first generation TARP vaccine . Sample size : N equal 40 maximum . - All patient undergo 18L apheresis mononuclear cell collection Week 0 . - All patient receive total 6 dos autologous ME TARP peptide DC vaccine : 20 x106 viable cells/dose ) deliver intradermally Weeks 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 24 .</detailed_description>
