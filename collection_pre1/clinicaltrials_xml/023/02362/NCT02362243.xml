	<brief_summary>Purpose Aims : The purpose study assess clinical effectiveness back core exercise intervention low back injury prevention firefighter . Aim 1 . Compare effectiveness 2 worksite exercise intervention ( supervise , web-based ) relative control reduce lose work day relate low back injury illness firefighter . Relevance : Low back injury one common disable disorder firefighter . Thus , novel intervention need counteract adverse consequence disorder impact firefighter safety . Methods : A cluster randomize control trial conduct career , full active duty firefighter ( n = 345 ) randomly assign ( fire station ) 1 3 intervention group - 1 ) supervise exercise ( n = 115 ) , 2 ) web-based exercise ( n = 115 ) , 3 ) control ( n = 115 ) . Participants supervise web-based exercise group perform back core exercise previously test recent FEMA-funded grant ( EMW-2009-FP-00418 ) , twice per week 12 month duty , addition usual physical fitness routine - The supervised group perform exercise direct supervision certify exercise specialist , web-based group utilize web-based exercise system . The control group perform back core exercise , continue usual physical fitness routine receive brief education general exercise physical activity principle . Outcome measure include low back injury illness data obtain cross-checked various source , standard clinical outcome measure low back pain disability , validate physical fitness test . Anticipated Outcomes : We hypothesize supervised web-based intervention reduce lose work day relate low back injury illness 40 % compare control . Assuming positive result , study deliver evidence-based exercise intervention low back injury prevention specifically design firefighter assess full-scale randomized control trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Low back injury one common disable disorder firefighter ( IAFF , 2008 ) . Thus , novel intervention need counteract adverse consequence disorder impact firefighter safety . Our long-term research objective develop test intervention reduce incidence , morbidity , economic , adverse consequence low back injury illness firefighter . Our previous study fund FEMA Assistance Firefighters Grant Program demonstrate : 1 ) relationship exist poor back muscular endurance increase prevalence low back pain firefighter ( Verna , 2010 ) ; 2 ) worksite intervention include back core exercise training safe effective improve back core muscular endurance firefighter ( Mayer , 2015 ) . The purpose current study , build upon previous work , assess clinical effectiveness back core exercise intervention low back injury prevention firefighter . Specific Aims ( Purpose ) Aim 1 . Compare effectiveness 2 worksite exercise intervention ( supervise , web-based ) relative control reduce lose work day relate low back injury illness firefighter . Hypotheses : Primary - The supervised exercise intervention reduce number lose work day relate low back injury illness 12-month intervention period 40 % compare control . Secondary - The web-based exercise intervention reduce number lose work day relate low back injury illness 12-month intervention period 40 % compare control . No difference supervise web-based exercise intervention lose work day observe . To test hypothesis , 3-arm , cluster randomize control trial conduct career , full active duty firefighter 76 station 3 fire rescue department Tampa Bay region Florida . Firefighters ( n = 345 ) randomly assign ( fire station ) 1 3 exercise intervention group - 1 ) supervise , ( n = 115 ) , 2 ) web-based ( n = 115 ) , 3 ) control ( n = 115 ) . Participants supervise web-based exercise group perform back core exercise previously test recent FEMA-funded grant ( EMW-2009-FP-00418 ) , twice per week 12 month , addition usual physical fitness routine . All participant give fire station receive intervention intervention complete normal shift hour fire station . The supervised group perform back core exercise on-site , 1-on-1 , direct supervision certify exercise specialist ( e.g . peer fitness trainer partner fire department ) exercise session use identical strategy previous study . The web-based group provide interactive web-based delivery , guidance , monitoring system back core exercise use technology develop group partner , along remote interaction guidance exercise specialist . The control group perform back core exercise , continue usual physical fitness routine receive brief education general exercise physical activity principle . Outcome measure test hypothesis include low back injury illness data obtain cross-checked various source , include administrative data ( primary outcome ) , report fire department worker ' compensation data , participant self-reported questionnaire accordance departmental , Occupational Safety Health Administration ( OSHA ) , fire service standard . Numerous clinically relevant measure low back pain injury illness , comorbidities , risk factor , prognosis also collect analyzed , incidence , frequency , severity , chronicity/duration , physical function , psychological measure ( e.g . fear avoidance ) , back core muscular endurance , body mass index , Functional Movement Screen , physical activity exercise measure , cost-effectiveness . In order inform implementation effort throughout fire service , conduct health economic analysis , cost effectiveness , collect data gain good understand context implementation exercise intervention . Potential impact firefighter health safety . The propose study provide pivotal evidence dissemination implementation throughout fire service . Assuming positive result , study deliver evidence-based exercise intervention low back injury prevention specifically firefighter assess full-scale randomized control trial.. The innovative , efficient , effective exercise intervention reduce adverse consequence low back injury illness firefighter , ready national implementation throughout fire service fire department similar characteristic test . If successfully implement , low back injury prevention program improve firefighter safety health order enhance resilience preparedness , effectively carry duty protect community . Further , low back injury prevention program help improve off-duty long-term quality life firefighter . Unique contribution body knowledge . Knowledge gap exist evidence-based approach low back injury prevention firefighter , particularly regard intervention clinical effectiveness , cost , implementation . The propose study ass intervention , responsive 4 health wellness priority 2011 National Fire Service Research Agenda ( NFFF , 2011 ) : 1.0 : Health disease relate firefighter wellness fitness ; 3.0 : Implementation / translational research ; 7.0 : Optimization performance reduce risk ; 8.0 : Cost effectiveness health safety system .</detailed_description>
