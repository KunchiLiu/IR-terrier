	<brief_summary>This phase II study design determine clinical efficacy PD-1 blockade , use anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) , administer consolidation therapy autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) , patient relapse refractory ( R/R ) Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , classical Hodgkin Lymphoma ( cHL ) peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) 1st remission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab After ASCT Hodgkin Lymphoma , DLBCL T-NHL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pembrolizumab antibody drug block molecule call PD-1 . PD-1 receptor molecule surface immune cell use turn immune response . Some cancer use way turn immune response . Blocking PD-1 pembrolizumabmay restore effective immune attack lymphoma cell . On study , patient undergo ASCT R/R cHL , DLBCL PTCL 1st remission receive pembrolizumab dose 200mg intravenously every 3 week 8 cycle , begin within week ASCT .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• Histologically confirm diagnosis review diagnostic pathology specimen one participate institution . Eligible histology : Arm A : Diffuse large B cell lymphoma ; patient prior history indolent Bcell NHL eligible , long histologically confirm DLBCL prior pretransplant salvage treatment . Patients mediastinal large B cell lymphoma also eligible . Arm B : Classical Hodgkin lymphoma ( patient nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma [ NLPHL ] NOT eligible ) Arm C : Peripheral T cell lymphoma eligible subtypes include PTCL , NOS ; AITL ; ALKnegative ALCL . Patients PTCL histology , include ALKpositive PTCL , cutaneous Tcell lymphoma eligible.. Age ≥ 18 time enrollment . For arm A B , participant must relapse refractory firstline chemotherapy , i.e. , must fail achieve CR firstline therapy must relapse subsequently achieve CR . For arm C , participant eligible transplant perform consolidation first remission ( partial complete ) . Participants must plan receive receive autologous stem cell transplantation . Participants must chemosensitive disease prior ASCT , define achieve least partial remission ( determine PET image ) salvage treatment . Participants cHL DLBCL ( arm A B ) transplant 1st remission one line treatment eligible . Participants PTCL ( arm C ) transplant beyond 1st remission also eligible . No 1 line anthracyclinecontaining chemotherapy prior ASCT , 3 line therapy total prior ASCT arm A B ; 1 line therapy prior ASCT arm C. Participants receive antineoplastic therapy ( include radiotherapy , chemotherapy immunotherapy ) ASCT Participants must PETCT restaging salvage therapy ASCT . Participants must begin study treatment later 21 day postASCT discharge . Additionally , must recover ASCT toxicity time first study treatment . ECOG performance status ≤2 Participants must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcL platelet ≥ 50,000/mcL Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dl total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) , direct bilirubin ≤ ULN patient Gilbert 's syndrome AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 × ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 Resting ambulatory oxygen saturation ≥ 94 % room air FEV1 DLCO ( adjust Hemoglobin ) ≥ 50 % predict Willigness use contraception Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Exclusion criteria Participants receive investigational agent ASCT . Participants active CNS involvement exclude . History active autoimmune disease , syndrome require systemic steroid autoimmune agent . Participants vitiligo , resolve childhood asthma atopy , hypothyroidism , Sjogren 's syndrome , well participant require intranasal steroid , intermittent use bronchodilator , local steroid injection , physiologic replacement dose prednisone ( ≤ 10 mg/d ) exclude study . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition pembrolizumab . Prior hypersensitivity reaction antiCD20 therapy antiCD30 therapy exclusion criterion . Has history ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid current pneumonitis . Receipt &gt; 600 mg/m2 total dose BCNU prior treatment include transplant conditioning regimen . Uncontrolled illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement pose excess risk participant opinion treat clinician.. Pregnant lactate woman . HIVpositive . Participants active viral hepatitis ( positive HepB sAg , positive HepB core Ab positive HepB viral load , positive HepC antibody positive HepC viral load ) . Receipt live vaccine within 30 day start treatment . Examples measles , mumps , rubella , varicella , yellow fever , rabies , BCG , oral polio vaccine , oral typhoid vaccine . Prior treatment anti PD1 , anti PDL1 , anti CTLA4 agent . Participants enter clinical remission one agent proceed ASCT without intervene relapse may eligible discussion Study Chair . Note patient enter remission checkpoint blockade therapy , count towards 3 line prior therapy .</criteria>
