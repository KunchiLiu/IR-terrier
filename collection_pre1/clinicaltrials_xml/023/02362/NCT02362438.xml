	<brief_summary>Background : - The Gigaxonin gene let body make protein chemical call Gigaxonin . Nerves need Gigaxonin work properly . Giant Axonal Neuropathy ( GAN ) cause shortage functional Gigaxonin . Nerves stop work normally people GAN . This cause problem walk sometimes eat , breathe , many activity . GAN cure . Over time , GAN shorten person life . Researchers want see gene transfer treatment may help people GAN . Objectives : - To see gene transfer safe show potential help people GAN . Eligibility : - People age 5 old GAN . Design : - For 2 month participant must live full-time within 100 mile NIH . - Participants screen phone person . They take many test . Some list . Their medical record review . Their caregiver may contact . - Participants total 30 visit , weekly , monthly , yearly 15 year . They include many test . - Physical nervous system exam . - Blood , urine , stool sample . - Nerve , lung , heart , eye test . - Questionnaires . - MRI scan , nerve biopsy , spinal tap . Participants sedate test . - Speech , memory , muscle , mobility test . - Skin biopsy ( small sample remove ) . - Participants take many medicine . Some require intravenous line . - Participants get gene transfer injection spinal tap cerebrospinal fluid , flow around brain spinal cord . The gene pack modified virus carry gene cell body . Participants safety guarantee .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This non-randomized , phase I , escalate single dose study assess safety gene transfer vector scAAV9/JeT-GAN intrathecal delivery brain spinal cord patient Giant Axonal Neuropathy ( GAN , OMIM No.256850 ) . The primary objective study assess safety vector follow intrathecal delivery 6-8 GAN patient least one missense change , five year age older ; well single GAN patient , 5 year old missense change GAN gene ( 'null mutation patient ' ) . Secondary objective study 1 ) ass motor sensory disease symptom pre- post-treatment , 2 ) examine neuropathology peripheral nerve biopsy response treatment , 3 ) examine cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) conduct CSF study assess response treatment , 4 ) ass vector shed follow vector administration . The first eligible missense patient genetic diagnosis giant axonal neuropathy , seven year age old , force vital capacity great equal 50 percent predict value pulmonary function test . This study first-in-human trial intrathecal delivery scAAV9/JeT-GAN . The primary endpoint safety , base upon adverse event standard laboratory safety evaluation . Secondary endpoint include clinical physiological assessment motor sensory function , possible rescue disease pathology peripheral nerve , examination CSF response treatment , assessment vector shed follow administration . GAN chronic neurodegenerative autosomal recessive disease pathologically characterize enlarged axon disorder microtubule intermediate filament . The disease pathology due loss-of-function mutation GAN gene , encode protein gigaxonin . Gigaxonin play major role maintenance orderly functional intermediate filament ( IF ) architecture , critical axonal function . Onset symptom , usually 3-4 year age , generally manifest slightly awkward gait ( sensory ataxia ) . In peripheral nervous system disease progressively affect predominantly sensory motor nerve . By end 2nd decade life , patient typically wheelchair dependent limit use arm little use leg . During 2nd decade tracheostomy mean ventilation , well feed tube , often necessary . Death normally occur 2nd 3rd decade life . There statistic incidence disease , consider extremely rare effective treatment disease . Intrathecal delivery gene transfer vector carry normal copy GAN Gene spinal cord brain offer potentially effective treatment GAN .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : In order participate study , subject must meet following criterion : 1 . Age 5 year old ; however , first patient young 7 year age . 2 . Genetic diagnosis GAN : Identified mutation ( ) copy GAN gene . If mutation find previously report , predictive software tool utilized order determine degree certainty mutation predict pathogenic ( disease cause ) . This also evaluate context clinical pathological phenotype ( see ) . 3 . Onset clinical sign symptom consistent GAN , include least abnormal gait , well physical examination finding include least abnormal gait , abnormal sensation ( proprioceptive and/ vibration sensation and/or positive Romberg ) , quantifiable weakness manual muscle test examination ( score &lt; 5/5 strength least one tested muscle ) . 4 . Men capable fathering child must agree use barrier contraception ( combination condom spermicide ) limit activity postmenopausal , surgically sterilize , contraceptionpracticing partner , 6 month administration investigational product . Women girls childbearing potential ( parents/ guardian minor &lt; 18 ) must agree urine human chorionic gonadotropin test perform rule possibility pregnancy visit . Those woman sexually active must also agree use barrier contraception well limit activity surgically sterilize contraceptionpracticing partner 36 month administration investigational product . This limitation set unknown risk associate administration vector genome offspring . There know risk sexual transmission vector . 5 . Willing able give inform consent &gt; 17 year age assent &gt; 7 year age . For patient age 717 , parent legal guardian must also consent child participation study . Adults lack capacity consent appropriate surrogate may include . 6 . Willingness undergo nerve biopsy baseline 12 month treatment . 7 . Agree reside within 100 mile study site least 2 month follow treatment ( may include housing NIH campus ) . EXCLUSION/DEFERRAL CRITERIA : In order participate study , patient MUST NOT follow characteristic : 1 . Pregnant lactate patient 2 . Forced vital capacity &lt; 50 % predict value 3 . Ventilator dependence include daytime use assist ventilation 4 . Current clinically significant infection include require systemic treatment include limited Human immunodeficiency virus , Hepatitis A , B , C , Varicella zoster virus , HTLV1 5 . Prior history bacterial meningitis 6 . Unwilling undergo lumbar puncture baseline 2 3 time follow first year treatment . 7 . Clinically significant echocardiogram abnormality per PI , anesthesiologist , cardiologist 8 . Clinically significant electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormality per PI , anesthesiologist , cardiologist 9 . History brain spinal cord disease would interfere LP procedure , CSF circulation , safety assessment 10 . Presence implant shunt drainage CSF implant CNS catheter 11 . Any prior participation study gene therapy vector stem cell transplantation administer avoid ambiguity safety assessment result linger effect previous treatment . 12 . Participation IND , IDE , equivalent clinical study past six month . 13 . History current chemotherapy , radiotherapy immunosuppressive therapy within past 30 day . Corticosteroid treatment may permit discretion PI . 14 . Immunizations kind month prior study avoid linger immune effect could confuse safety assessment trial . 15 . Current use medication ( e.g. , levothyroxine , vitamin A supplementation , oral contraceptive use , tetracycline , Diamox ) could potentially lead change intracranial pressure 16 . Known sensitivity adverse reaction anesthetic medication likely use perioperative period per anesthesiologist evaluation 17 . GAN subject without quantifiable weakness functional loss 18 . Evidence cardiomyopathy history , exam , additional testing ( echocardiogram electrocardiogram ) cardiac disease opinion investigator would deem subject unsafe participate trial 19 . History diabetes clinically significant abnormality glucose tolerance test , fast blood sugar 20 . Positive purified protein derivative test tuberculosis 21 . Abnormal laboratory value consider clinically significant per investigator : 1 . Platelet count &lt; 100,000 / mm3 2 .
