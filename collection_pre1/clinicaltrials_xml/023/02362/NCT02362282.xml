	<brief_summary>Recent research gait train stroke survivor show coordinated gait component best restore use follow intervention together : coordination exercise , ground gait training , body weight support treadmill training ( BWSTT ) . These result important , investigator ' knowledge , report restoration coordinate gait component persistent gait deficit ( &gt; 6 month stroke ) . However , remain problem restore coordinated gait movement measure laboratory generalize many subject everyday environment . The confluence several factor cause lack generalization . First , dual task performance ( gait cognitive attention task ) degrade gait attention ability , even healthy adult . Second , stroke impair attention . Third , walk everyday environment , attention require order safely process normally occur stimulus . Therefore , give success new gait training protocol lab setting , important address problem remain generalization recover coordinated gait pattern everyday environment . The primary hypothesis study great gain gait speed produce combined motor cognitive training versus motor train alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Cognitive Gait Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1 , Hypothesis Ia : Comparison combine motor cognitive training v motor train alone . For Aim 1 , Hypothesis Ia , randomize , control study . For two group , 38 subject enrol randomize either : A ) Motor + Cognitive Training ; B ) Motor Training alone . Subjects first stratify accord coordination gait deficit severity , describe . After stratification , subject randomize one two intervention group Hypothesis Ia . All subject receive treatment 5 times/week , 3hrs/session , 12 week total 60 treatment session . Group A receive combine motor cognitive training ; Table 2 ( ) show graduate approach provide combined gait cognitive training . Data collection week 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 ( i.e. , , mid-treatment treatment , 3 month end treatment protocol . Comparison make two group determine whether additive effectiveness cognitive training . Aim 2 , Hypotheses IIa-d : Pre/post-treatment comparison within Group A , receive combine motor cognitive training . For Aim 2 , Hypotheses IIa-d , single cohort pre/post-treatment comparison within Group A receiving combine motor cognitive training . Aim 3 , Hypotheses IIIa-d : Pre/post-treatment comparison within Group B , receive motor train alone . For Aim 3 , Hypotheses IIIa-d , single cohort pre/post-treatment comparison within Group B , receive motor train alone .</detailed_description>
