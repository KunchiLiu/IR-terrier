	<brief_title>The Effect Urban Sanitation Intervention Child Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We design control , before-and-after ( CBA ) effectiveness study estimate health impact urban sanitation intervention informal neighborhood Maputo , Mozambique , include assessment whether exposure health outcome vary localize population density . The intervention consist private pour-flush latrine ( septic tank ) share multiple household compound household cluster . We measure objective health outcome approximately 1000 child ( 500 child household access intervention , 500 control use exist share private latrine poor sanitary condition ) , two time point : immediately intervention follow-up 12 month . The primary outcome combine prevalence enteric infection among child 5 year age . Secondary outcome measure include soil transmit helminth ( STH ) re-infection child follow baseline de-worming prevalence report gastrointestinal illness . We use exposure assessment , fecal source tracking , microbial transmission model examine whether route exposure diarrheagenic pathogen STHs vary transmission impact pathogens follow introduction effective sanitation . Our analysis focus specifically impact localize population density potential modifier sanitation-related exposure .</detailed_description>
