	<detailed_description>Evaluating Cancer Survivorship Care Models Study Overview Research Design Cancer complex disease require complex treatment cause lasting impact treatment end . Some patient face last physical , psychosocial , spiritual and/or practical challenge adjust life cancer . Fortunately , health care clinicians begin focus consequence cancer treatment actively work cancer survivor manage post-treatment need care . The Evaluating Cancer Survivorship Care Models project groundbreaking 3-year comparative effectiveness research ( CER ) study examines best deliver follow-up care cancer survivor . This project lead George Washington University fund Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute . A key component project use stakeholder Advisory Board chair cancer survivor serve senior advisor research team . The Advisory Board include survivor , survivor advocate , clinician , health care professional advisor stakeholder across myriad facet cancer care , include Cancer Support Community , LIVESTRONG , Commission Cancer , American Cancer Society . These organization critical success project . The study innovative focus patient-centered outcome . The first phase project employ mixed method approach include secondary analysis exist data 4 national survey , focus group cancer survivor , environmental scan exist survivorship program national survey cancer survivor develop outcomes tool prospective observational CER study . Based result first phase , study team George Washington University ( GW ) develop patient-prioritized index identify service component care patient equate high quality survivorship care . Three model survivorship care Commission Cancer-accredited institution identify environmental scan . In CER phase study , survivorship care model serve comparator two model . Patients CER study population adult diagnose non-metastatic breast , prostate colorectal cancer complete active treatment . Patient-reported outcome assess three point project : baseline ( immediately prior immediately follow post-treatment survivorship visit ) , 3 month post-visit 6 month post-visit . Multivariable analysis include repeated measure mixed-effect regression model use control systematic difference across group , would increase validity result . Using newly-developed index , comparative effectiveness study measure quality program accord patient identify important . The investigator launch CER phase study enrol high-performing survivorship program . Our pool invite participant consist Commission Cancer-accredited sit clinical survivorship care program meet follow eligibility criterion : - Provide service survivor breast , prostate colorectal cancer - Have demonstrate high performance level incorporate element survivorship care clinical care delivery - See least 60 new survivor yearly - Includes common characteristic related delivery survivorship care During CER study , data gather survivorship program administrator , patient survivorship care clinician . Survivorship program administrator complete interview survey examine survivorship program organize identify key characteristic program determine factor influential deliver high quality post-treatment survivorship care . Patients complete survey measure patient-centered outcome : health-related quality life ; self-efficacy ; satisfaction ; health care utilization newly develop measure quality survivorship care prioritized patient . Clinicians complete survey service offer participate patient ' initial post-treatment survivorship visit . Together , data allow GW study team understand successful strategy transform care delivery system responsive patient need . In third final phase , project generate critical data variety decision-makers related care post-treatment cancer survivor result evidence-based guidance organize deliver post-treatment care . The GW study team seek provide recommendation survivorship care delivery best practice ; develop tool improve survivorship program care delivery clinician patient perspective ; widely disseminate finding variety stakeholder , include survivor family , clinician , survivorship care program leader , payer , policymakers others .</detailed_description>
