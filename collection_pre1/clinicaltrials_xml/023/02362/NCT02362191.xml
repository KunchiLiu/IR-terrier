	<brief_summary>Purpose : Using transcranial alternate current stimulation ( tACS ) , investigator study attempt treat mood dysregulation woman premenstrual dysphoric disorder ( PMDD ) . Participants : Women age 18-45 diagnosis PMDD confirm participation PMDD diagnostic study ( IRB # 05-3000 ) . Procedures ( method ) : After re-screening consent appointment , eligible participant begin daily rating baseline EEG perform follicular luteal phase . Following luteal phase EEG , patient receive , double blind cross-over fashion , 5 day tACS , 40 minutes/session , perform two successive month . On first fifth day treatment , EEG perform . Patients ' symptom assess end session daily mood rating .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder ( PMDD ) describe cyclic appearance affective symptom resultant impairment luteal phase menstrual cycle . The objective application determine transcranial alternate current electrical stimulation ( tACS ) reverse dysphoric mood state experience woman disorder . The central hypothesis application , subgroup susceptible woman , reproductive steroid-induced alteration cortical dynamic result sustain appearance dysphoric mood state . The cause PMDD unknown , morbidity substantial , identified treatment limited effectiveness , since 40 % PMDD woman non-responders selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) many additional woman intolerant antidepressant induced side effect . The importance understanding basis affective dysregulation PMDD twofold : 1 ) The disorder prevalent ( 6-8 % woman reproductive age ) , attend substantial morbidity , hence significant public health problem . Indeed , World Health Calculations , PMDD associate 4.5 million Disability Adjusted Life Years US alone ; 2 ) PMDD serve model illuminate pathophysiology affective state change thereby inform understand affective disorder . The rationale test efficacy tACS PMDD follow : 1 ) Role Hormones : While little evidence ovarian dysfunction PMDD , role reproductive hormone clearly implicate , since many trial show suppression ovarian function result complete remission symptom majority woman PMDD , add back gonadal hormone result return symptoms woman PMDD , symptom see control . Both estradiol progesterone appear capable precipitate mood destabilization paradigm . Recently complete study demonstrate continuous administration hormone longer one month result sustain symptom remission subsequent initial precipitate episode . Thus , dysphoric mood state PMDD appear induce normal change gonadal hormone rather exposure elevate hormone level ( i.e. , woman PMDD differentially sensitive mood dysregulatory effect reproductive steroid ) . Differential Effects Cortical Activity : Although substantial literature demonstrate effect reproductive steroid , extension , menstrual cycle cortical activity , usually describe effect disturbed woman PMDD . Examples include follow : 1 ) normal woman , activation medial orbitofrontal cortex diminish luteal phase affective valence stimulus responds reverse ( i.e. , respond negative stimulus rather positive stimulus , occur follicular phase ) . These change absent woman PMDD . 2 ) normal woman luteal phase , increase cortical inhibition - presumed effect gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) receptor activate effect progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone . This effect absent woman PMDD . Both animal human data suggest role disturbed cortical response progesterone-derived neurosteroids PMDD . Thus , sudden change level allopregnanolone ( occurs start luteal phase increase level progesterone ) result subcortical excitability irritability rodent , elimination change progesterone-derived neurosteroids ( neurosteroid synthesis inhibition ) successfully prevent emergence dysphoric state PMDD . Differential Network Activation : Psychiatric disorder characterize dysregulation affective state -depression PMDD - increasingly recognize `` network disorder '' aberrant electric signal large-scale neuronal network mediate clinical symptom . Recent study document impaired balance activation leave right prefrontal cortex patient PMDD . In particular , similar major depressive disorder , balance alpha oscillation power leave right hemisphere shift towards leave patient PMDD . The presence alpha oscillation correspond relative decrease neuronal activity ( inverse relationship ) . Therefore , left-shifted alpha asymmetry indicative hypoactivation leave hemisphere - common find imaging study patient MDD . Since asymmetry exacerbate luteal follicular phase ( corresponding time course symptom presentation PMDD ) , investigator hypothesize normalization alpha oscillation across hemisphere would reduce symptom presentation patient PMDD . This network level intervention accomplish brain stimulation application weak electric current , non-invasive approach modulate intrinsic cortical network dynamic . The advantage approach twofold : non-pharmacologic thus avoids otherwise attendant side effect ; provide system level insight pathophysiology underlie mood state dysregulation . Brain stimulation constant electric current apply scalp ( tDCs ) modulate neuronal excitability human . Transcranial current stimulation sine-wave stimulation waveform ( transcranial alternate current stimulation , tACS ) likely enhance cortical oscillation frequency specific manner . The mechanisms weak electric field generate tDCS tACS previously demonstrate interact cortical network activity alter temporal activity structure electric signal cortex . This study test hypothesis enhance bilateral alpha synchronization ( 8-12 Hz ) reduce severity primary symptom PMDD : irritability , depression , mood swing , anxiety . The rationale stimulation know deficit overall structure cortical activity frequency band patient mood disorder previously demonstrate clinical benefit tDCS treatment mood disorder . Renormalization activity pattern may therefore provide therapeutic modulation measurable clinical improvement . This study use target stimulation waveform employ bilateral tACS instead tDCS . The investigator hypothesize choice sophisticated waveform directly enhance synchronization two hemisphere may decrease symptom . tDCS modulate overall activity level target cortical area non-specific manner . Here , however , propose evaluate specific stimulation modality , tACS , ( 10 Hz stimulation frequency ) show selectively enhance cortical alpha rhythm . Since target patient population exhibit specific deficit alpha frequency band , stimulation approach provide target therefore possibly effective manipulation . Furthermore , investigator expect able correlate treatment outcomes EEG signal measure stimulation . Please note investigator several ongoing complete IRB-approved study ( 12-0022 , 12-1607,13-2995 , 13-3385 ) employ tDCS and/or tACS , include clinical trial register clinicaltrials.gov ( # NCT01963676 ) .</detailed_description>
