	<brief_summary>Pancreatitis important complication ERCP . The severity condition varies mild severe lead prolong hospitalization , surgical intervention , even death . Several patient-related procedure relate factor identify associate high risk post-ERCP pancreatitis . So far , several method propose avoid pancreatitis patient high risk complication . Several study show different drug therapy ( indomethacin suppository , sublingual nitrate tablet administration intravenous Ringer 's solution ) may reduce incidence post-ERCP pancreatitis . All drug therapy safe , cheap easy administer . Several study show pancreatic duct stenting ( placement plastic tube pancreatic duct ) effective intervention prevent reduce severity post-ERCP pancreatitis , especially high-risk group . However , still drawbacks consider pancreatic duct stenting : difficulty insertion PD stent , associate need radiological follow-up and/or repeat endoscopy removal , high cost small important risk complication ( e.g . stent migration ) . Most clinical trial pancreatic duct stenting perform , result trial drug therapy available . Moreover , RCT ( investigator knowledge ) compare efficacy pancreatic duct stenting patient already receive combination drug therapy prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis high-risk patient . The purpose study determine noninferiority combination drug therapy relation pancreatic duct stenting prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis high-risk patient .</brief_summary>
