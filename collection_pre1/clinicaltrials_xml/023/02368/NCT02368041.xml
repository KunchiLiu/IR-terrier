	<brief_summary>This single-center , non-randomized study.The study staff use InSpectraTM tissue oxygen saturation ( StO2 ) monitor manufacture Hutchinson Technology measure baseline StO2 level apply noninvasive probe thenar eminence . After stable reading obtain , blood pressure cuff inflate 40 mmHg obtain systolic pressure rate desaturation ( Rdes ; % × sec-1 ) record . After 3 minute StO2 level come zero ( whichever earlier ) , cuff pressure release rate reperfusion ( Rres ; % × sec-1 ) measure . The investigator hypothesize heart failure child cause baseline lower thenar tissue oxygen saturation ( StO2 ) , faster rate desaturation ( Rdes ) prolong rate reperfusion ( Rres ) . The investigator also hypothesize change correlate severity heart failure . The result study provide groundwork study look correlation therapy modification base combination thenar StO2 clinical presentation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heart failure patient see Pediatric Cardiology Congenital Heart Center enrol study obtain informed consent day evaluation . The primary pediatric cardiologist follow patient evaluate need regular investigation like blood work , electrocardiogram echocardiogram . The study staff use InSpectraTM tissue oxygen saturation ( StO2 ) monitor manufacture Hutchinson Technology measure baseline StO2 level apply noninvasive probe thenar eminence . After stable reading obtain blood pressure cuff inflate 40 mmHg obtain systolic pressure rate desaturation ( Rdes ; % × sec-1 ) record . After 3 minute StO2 level come zero ( whichever earlier ) , cuff pressure release rate reperfusion ( Rres ; % × sec-1 ) measure . Similar measurement obtain otherwise healthy cohort child present Pediatric Cardiology Congenital Heart Center evaluation heart murmur chest pain . The patient 's treating physician care provider blind study test result . All clinical care discretion patient 's treating physician . Only StO2 level obtain use non-invasive probe place thenar eminence purpose study .</detailed_description>
