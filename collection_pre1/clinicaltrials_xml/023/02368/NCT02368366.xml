	<detailed_description>Background : Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) common cause acquire disability youth source significant morbidity family burden . Novel behavior problem among common problematic consequence , yet many youth fail receive need psychological service due lack identification access . Linking youth TBI effective treatment could improve functional outcome , reduce family burden , increase treatment satisfaction . Methods : The investigator overarch aim compare effectiveness , feasibility , acceptability three format family problem solve therapy ( F-PST ) improve functional outcome complicate mild severe adolescent TBI : therapist-guided , face-to-face ; therapist-guided online ; self-guided , online F-PST . The efficacy face-to-face online F-PST reduce behavior problem follow TBI establish . However , comparative acceptability effectiveness unknown unclear family could also benefit online F-PST without therapist support . To identify patient benefit intervention , participant stratify distance clinic patient live 20 mile 60 minute clinic randomize one two online arm others equally randomize among three arm . Patient-reported outcome pertain child , caregiver , family function along patient treatment preference assess : prior treatment initiation , treatment completion , follow-up 3 month later . Stakeholder input ( adolescent TBI caregiver ) guide measurement selection refinement treatment protocol . Each treatment modality consist 10-14 session address TBI education , problem-solving , self-regulation , family communication , varies nature extent therapist involvement . Participants include family 120 adolescent age 14-18 recruit four metropolitan TBI center . Mixed model analysis use examine group difference improvements child behavior/functioning , caregiver distress , family burden . Moderators comparative effectiveness include socioeconomic status , prior technology use , patient preference examine . Anticipated Impact : Results elucidate relative effectiveness face-to-face versus online self-directed versus therapist-supported online mode treatment include patient family preference . They also provide information program deliver disseminate exist head injury follow-up clinic . These data could potentially translate patient population youth psychological symptom arise neurological condition .</detailed_description>
