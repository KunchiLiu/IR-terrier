	<brief_summary>This project expand upon proof-of-concept work do pilot project order get Interventionaire© poise widespread use . Interventionaire© design deploy computerized interactive questionnaire patient physician wait room . The information gather intend conversation starter primary care provider patient ( may feel ease computer reveal health risk behavior , like alcohol abuse ) . Widespread use Interventionaire© could result substantial cost saving deliver wide reach highly acceptable prevention strategy integrate risky health behavior screen brief intervention mainstream medical practice.The investigator overall hypothesis participant receive computerized intervention great improvement receive attention control condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computerized Alcohol Misuse Intervention System Health Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcohol misuse continue pose major burden public health . Screening brief intervention alcohol misuse primary care setting recommend decade , evidence base support primary care robust . However , many primary care provider intervene alcohol misuse , often fail systematically accordance best-evidence standard . Computerization screen brief intervention alcohol misuse hold promise alleviate many barrier prevent adoption routine care , also offer new opportunity optimize effectiveness brief intervention . This Phase 2 Small Business Technology Transfer ( STTR ) project follow Research Circle Associates ' ( RCA ) successful proof-of-concept work do Phase 1 , lead development versatile software platform ( Interventionaire© ) support computerize alcohol misuse screen brief intervention use evidence base strategy include motivational interviewing normative feedback . The investigator ' computerize alcohol misuse intervention include normative feedback component unique micro-targeting alcohol use feedback base participant demographic characteristic ( race/ethnicity , gender , age ) , draw population normative data National Surveys Drug Use Health . This represent novel use epidemiological data inform clinical service . The Phase 2 project design answer number important research question prepare product successful commercialization . Specifically , Phase 2 investigator intend implement several refinement Interventionaire© platform increase usability streamline creation complex content tailor feedback . The investigator also upgrade software make compatible major electronic health record system use investigator ' clinical partner site . This increase reach product ensure maximum readiness deployment modern healthcare marketplace , dynamic rapidly evolve industry . The investigator also conduct study investigator ' clinical partner site use qualitative key informant , focus group , survey methodology investigate barrier adopt computerized alcohol screen brief intervention system . A critical question whether computerized alcohol misuse intervention effective change drink behavior . To answer question , investigator conduct cross-over randomized control trial examine short-term impact computerize alcohol misuse intervention micro-targeted normative feedback motivational messaging compare `` attention-control '' ( placebo ) generic health promotion message . This trial help establish short-term efficacy intervention set stage large trial adoption product healthcare setting . Finally , investigator conduct projection analysis economic health impact intervention variety assumption regard intervention effect size , target population , product penetration . Satisfying Phase 2 objective leave RCA well-poised deploy product commercially , leverage power market improve clinical service delivery promote public health .</detailed_description>
