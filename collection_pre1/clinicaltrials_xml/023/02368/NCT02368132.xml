In second intervention , care management tailor deliver individual CG , support , psychoeducation , skills training deliver ( also phone ) group format . This study allow u examine added benefit participate CG group provide mutual peer support feedback . The investigator also evaluate extent spousal vs. adult child CGs respond differently two intervention .

	<detailed_description>Background : Existing intervention informal caregiver ( CGs ) care recipient ( CRs ) dementia vary multiple dimension ( e.g. , content , administration time , mode delivery ) , finding indicate program effective improve CG CR outcomes . The investigator ' team develop evaluate two CG program unique relatively brief ( i.e. , 3 month ) rely solely telephone administration . The original program , Telehealth Education Program ( TEP ) , provide CG support , psychoeducation , skills train group format . The second program adapt original TEP deliver individual CGs include collaborative care management service .

Nonetheless , individually-delivered program lack benefit derive mutual peer support feedback provide group-based intervention . What remain determined , therefore , whether modify individually-delivered care management program deliver TEP group format effective individually-delivered program alone . Objectives : The objective project include : ) test comparative effectiveness 2 delivery model ( individual TEP + individual care management vs. group TEP + individual care management ) telephone-based , collaborative dementia care intervention CGs , b ) explore whether individual individual + group intervention effective/acceptable among spousal vs. adult child CGs . Methods : To meet objective , investigator use prospective , randomized control group , repeat measure ( i.e. , baseline , 3 , 6 , 12 month follow-up ) design . Participants include 405 CGs ( spouses child 18 year age old ) Veterans diagnose dementia receive routine clinical care two VA site . CGs recruit participation live and/or provide 4+ hour care/day . CGs randomly assign usual care , individual intervention , individual + group intervention . The main objective intervention facilitate resource connection provide education , psychosocial support , care management individual care Veterans dementia , thereby improve access use non-institutional service , rate guideline adherent care , CG/CR outcomes . In intervention , CGs receive education , continuous support , skill training , monitor Veterans ' medication adherence , symptom , service need . CGs ask complete assessment battery standardize measure CR- CG-characteristics . Veterans ' clinical medical record ( include cost data ) also evaluate screen clinical data collection purpose . Generalized estimate equation ( GEE ) primary method use analyze nested , longitudinal data .</detailed_description>
