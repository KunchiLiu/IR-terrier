	<brief_summary>Research design : This control prospective study . Methodology : Patients newly diagnose untreated OSA total apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) &gt; 5/h , control ( AHI &lt; 5/h ) recruit Long Beach VA sleep center . Controls subject without OSA sleep disorder sign pulmonary hypertension base echo . The investigator also measure pulmonary artery pressure 2D Echo exclude patient sign leave heart dysfunction . PH define RVSP &gt; 35 mmHg mean PA pressure &gt; 25 mmHg . The investigator recruit subject without PH OSA three separate group : 1. group one : OSA+ PH , 2. group two : normal individual OSA PH , 3. group three : OSA PH Pulmonary function test do exclude patient underlie lung disease . The inclusion criterion : Age &gt; 20 , AHI &gt; 5 , AHI &lt; 5 ( control ) , RVSP &gt; 35 mmHg OR Mean PA pressure &gt; 25 mmHg , RVSP &lt; 35 mmHg OR Mean PA pressure &lt; 25 mmHg ( control ) . Subjects exclude known peripheral vascular disease , liver disease , hemolytic anemia , inflammatory disease , active infection , pregnant , therapy OSA , chronic steroid treatment , young 20 year age , patient leave heart failure ( systolic diastolic ) , patient PH medication include sildenafil , active smoker , COPD asthma , active infection inflammatory disease collagen vascular disease . Nocturnal polysomnography perform scored accord American Academy Sleep Medicine . Exhaled Carbon monoxide ( CO ) measure calibrate fuel cell type electrochemical device sensor sensitivity 1 ppm . The mean three reproducible measurement record correct ambient CO. Exhaled Nitric Oxide ( NO ) measure . At test session , least three flow-regulated FENO measurement perform . The investigator repeat 2D Echo measurement factor 3 month CPAP treatment . The investigator also check patient 's compliance treatment download data CPAP device . Each subject inform experimental procedure , approve Human Investigation Committee VA-Long Beach . Finding : The investigator hypothesize HO pathway cause perturbation pulmonary endothelial function inhibition nitric oxide . Clinical significance : OSA associate PH , exact mechanism well know . In past , I show increase endogenous CO setting elevate NO concentration associate endothelial dysfunction patient OSA . Therefore , investigator seek investigate role HO NO pathways patient OSA associate PH . Impact/significance : It address fundamental gap understand OSA result increase pulmonary artery pressure substantiate , provide basis design test new approach prevention treatment OSA .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. participant must satisfy diagnostic criterion Obstructive sleep apnea . 2. evidence pulmonary hypertension disease base upon one following : RVSP &gt; 35 mmHg OR Mean PA pressure &gt; 25 mmHg , RVSP &lt; 35 mmHg OR Mean PA pressure &lt; 25 mmHg ( control ) . 3. age great equal 20 year . 4. significant alcohol use ( 7 few drink per week ) . 1. peripheral vascular disease 2. liver disease 3 . Pregnancy . A serum pregnancy test must perform negative woman child bear potential within 2 week prior enrollment . 4 . Any medical psychosocial condition , opinion investigator , could jeopardize subject 's participation , compliance study criterion . 5. hemolytic anemia 6. inflammatory disease 7. active infection , 8. therapy OSA , 9. chronic steroid treatment , 10. young 20 year age , 11. patient left heart failure ( systolic diastolic ) , 12. patient pulmonary hypertension medication include sildenafil , 13. active smoker , 14 . COPD asthma , 15. active infection inflammatory disease 16. collagen vascular disease .</criteria>
