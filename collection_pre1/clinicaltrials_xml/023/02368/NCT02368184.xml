	<brief_summary>The purpose study obtain observational data allow preliminary assessment utility noninvasive physiologic monitor monitoring patient congestive heart failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study CoVa™ Monitoring Patients With Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study propose utilize CoVa™ Monitoring System , novel body-worn sensor remotely monitor thoracic fluid , heart rate , heart rate variability , respiration rate , skin temperature , posture , , use transmitted waveform , stroke volume cardiac output evaluate system 's monitoring capability individual recently hospitalize congestive heart failure . The data acquire study play critical roll develop future interventional study allow patient HF potentially receive well timely treatment home setting , decrease hospitalization improve quality life .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults age 18 Have wireless internet access within home . Acute hospitalization primary diagnosis acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) diagnose basis following : 1 . Symptoms : Onset worsen dyspnea within past 2 week 2 . Physical exam ( least 1 present ) : Rales/ Crackles auscultation Elevated JVP &gt; 8 cmH2O Weight gain LE edema 3 . Diagnostic imaging/ lab ( least 1 present ) : Evidence pulmonary congestion edema chest Xray/ chest CT Elevated NTproBNP ( ageadjusted ) ( &gt; 1000 ) Patients particular interest already Medtronic Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy device OptiVol feature track transthoracic impedance . Allergy ECG electrodes Psychological social situation would make study difficult patient Inability consent Pregnant woman Pneumonia currently , within past 30 day Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema ( e.g . ARDS ) Interstitial lung disease Endstage renal disease hemodialysis For reason unable wear place CoVa™ device , e.g . pectus excavatum , fragile skin , severe arthritis .</criteria>
