This gap weight loss intervention science call adaptive intervention approach could provide `` right treatment right time right person '' . Adaptive intervention individualize treatment empirically-supported decision rule advise treatment unfold time maximize effectiveness . Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials ( SMART ) , develop explicitly build best adaptive intervention , use experimental design principle develop decision rule . The investigator use SMART systematically evaluate therapeutic approach timing difference intervene respond behavioral weight loss program . Self-regulation challenge identify major adherence barrier . Two attractive option address self-regulation difficulty : 1 ) supplement behavioral treatment Meal Replacements ( MR ) decrease need self-regulation ; 2 ) switch therapeutic approach use enhanced version behavioral weight loss therapy teach acceptance base behavioral skill boost capacity self-regulation . Additionally , two time point intervene non-responders evaluate : 1 ) 3 week , base current weight loss trial evidence ; 2 ) 7 week , base average time use exist step care literature . Adults ( n=500 ) recruit receive individual behavioral weight loss treatment ( BWL ) . Participants randomize either : 1 ) treatment response assessment 3 week 2 ) treatment response assessment 7 week . Subjects lose expected amount weight assessment point , continue traditional behavioral weight loss therapy . For lose expected amount weight , re-randomize either meal replacement addition traditional weight loss therapy enhance version behavioral weight loss therapy .</detailed_description>
