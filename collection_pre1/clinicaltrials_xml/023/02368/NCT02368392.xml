	<detailed_description>4 General objective To describe incidence `` in-hospital '' death , outcomes attempted cardiac arrest resuscitation availability resuscitation equipment Sri Lankan state Hospitals . 4.1 Specific objective - To describe incidence in-hospital death state sector Hospitals Sri Lanka . - To describe availability resource cardiac arrest management setting . - To describe incidence attempt resuscitation cardiac arrest . - To describe immediate outcome attempt resuscitation cardiac arrest . - To describe ICU , Hospital 30 day post discharge outcomes patient - To describe health related quality patient survive 1 year 5 Methodology 5.1 Study one 5.1.1 Study design One week cross-sectional study 5.1.2 Study set In state sector Hospitals ( Base Hospitals ) 5.1.3 Administrative process Once ethical review process complete , The Hospital Directors/Medical Superintendent ( Hospital Consultants ) officially inform study office Deputy Director General ( Education , Training Research ) ( DDG ET &amp; R ) Ministry Health . Medical Officers nominate study office . A small financial incentive provide Doctors study period ( ) . The investigator also seek permission Steering committee National Intensive Care Surveillance obtain ICU admission , outcome follow-up data IHCA patient NICS database . 5.1.4 Study population All patient die in-hospital CPR attempt within time period study . 5.1.4.1 Exclusions criterion - Dead arrival Hospital - Neonate ( less 28 day ) 5.1.5 Study sample Entire population 5.1.6 Study period One week period July/August 2014 5.1.7 Sample size One week period study 5.1.8 Sampling method Not applicable 5.1.9 Data collection tool During study period , nominate pre-trained medical officer Hospital complete questionnaire use online form daily basis . The data collector interview Ward Sister , House Officer senior nurse twice ( around 7 7 pm ) daily . Non- ward area operate theatre , emergency room also cover . This process pilot five hospital prior study fine tune process . 5.1.9.1 Data validation Death register ward/mortuary Matron 's office use validate data collect Hospital death discrepancies resolve . Random validation data collect Hospital level do centrally daily basis one-week period . ICU admission reason also collect ICUs period detect ICU admission due in-hospital cardiac arrest , also use method validation . 5.1.10 Study variables The following collected daily one week period - Number in-ward death - Number attempt resuscitation - Number successful resuscitation subsequent location - Number admit ICU ( name BHT number ) follow resuscitation location ICUs - Total number in-ward patient midnight , daily , study period . - In addition begin study period facility available resuscitation collect ward/theatre standard resuscitation council equipment checklist . The staff participation previous resuscitation training gather anonymously time . This information collect . 5.2 Study two 5.2.1 Study design Longitudinal study 5.2.2 Study set All Intensive Care Units patient successfully resuscitate admit . 5.2.3 Study period From begin study period study 1 , 30 day ICU discharge last patient admit ICU successful resuscitation , maximum 90 day start study period . 5.2.4 Sample size All patient admit ICU successful resuscitation study 1 , include . We unable estimate sample size study number patient admit cardiac arrest period know . The purpose part study actually know number patient admit ICU resuscitation outcome . No causative association propose product part study.We select one-week recruitment period national study feel feasible duration u . 5.2.5 Sampling method All patient successful resuscitation admit ICU study 1 , include . 5.2.6 Data collection tool The data gather , appropriate permission seek , , National Intensive Care Surveillance ( NICS ) database . No new data need gather ICUs . If ICU part NICS network , follow resuscitate patient non-NICS ICUs . Health related Quality Life , neurological disability status patient review use SF-12 , EQ-5Dand MRS survive 1 year . 5.2.7 Study variables The following data collect eligible patient use National Intensive Care Surveillance database ICU part network . - Outcomes ICU discharge - Outcomes Hospital discharge - Outcomes 30 day post discharge In non-NICS ICUs determine ICU outcomes contact ICUs least week . We also determine hospital 30 day outcome obtain contact telephone number patient next kin . This similar methodology currently employ patient admitted NICS ICUs . - Health related Quality Life , neurological disability status patient survive 6 month 1 year 6 Statistical analysis : Data analyze use Statistical Package Social Sciences 18 Stata 13 . Discrete variable express count ( percentage ) continuous variable mean ( Â± standard deviation ( SD ) median ( inter quartile range ( IQR ) ) . For description variable standard descriptive statistic use . For comparison continuous variable test use chi square use compare discrete variable . Multivariate logistic regression analysis use describe prevalence select factor antecedent contributory feature cardiac arrest . 7 Ethics 7.1 Consent : Permission take relevant Authorities Ministry Health Hospitals describe detail . Personal identifier data patient collect except Name , BHT number , address telephone number successfully resuscitate . The investigator data collector come direct contact patient except determine 30 day outcome . 7.2 Risks patient : There obvious risk patient . 7.3 Benefits : Potential benefit many individual patient level , Hospital level national level . The study enable quantification burden recognize cardiac arrest , outcome possible antecedent/contributory factor enable formulation concrete strategy improve care . 7.4 Confidentiality : Data extraction sheet complete nominated medical officer propose expert committee . Data store computer authorize personal access information information password protect back . 7.5 Dissemination information : The finding disseminate form abstract submit scientific session , journal article presentation . They may use local national guideline preparation . 7.6 Beneficiaries : There three main category beneficiary . The Ministry Health benefit information know ground situation able plan direct donor improvement need resource well capacity building . The staff benefit able identify area improvement service give IHCA resuscitation thus opportunity improve skill resuscitation . Thus data use develop service human resource improve IHCA management patient come .</detailed_description>
