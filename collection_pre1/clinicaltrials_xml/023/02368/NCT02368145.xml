	<detailed_description>Depression common long-term outcome acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) , impede recovery , increase stroke recurrence , influence mortality stroke . Based literature review , investigator propose novel over-arching hypothesis : post-stroke depression ( PSD ) occur patient show elevated production proinflammatory immune cytokine and/or stroke , time present reduced sensitivity immunosuppressive effect glucocorticoid , otherwise would expect down-regulated cytokine production .</detailed_description>
