	<brief_summary>Ebola virus cause infection know Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) . This generally severe disease also lead death . The 2014 outbreak EVD West Africa large ever . Researchers want develop vaccine prevent Ebola infection . This study ass safety single dose bivalent Ebola Zaire candidate vaccine VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP ( cAD3-EBO ) administer healthy Malian adult volunteer , age 18-65 year ( mostly health care worker front line worker [ e.g. , individual incinerate contaminate material ] ) , one 2 dosage level , 2.0 x 10 ( 10 ) vp 2 x 10 ( 11 ) vp . It impossible someone get Ebola infection vaccine . Heterologous booster dose allocation - Each participant offer opportunity include booster step study . After obtain consent additional review pertinent medical history , participant group randomize receive candidate booster vaccine , MVA-EbolaZ placebo . This first clinical trial Mali bivalent cAd3-based Ebola vaccine first dosage level contains &gt; 10 ( 11 ) vp . It follow completion Phase Ib trial Malian health care worker test three dosage level monovalent cAd3-EBO Z vaccine . The data generate West Africans ( Mali ) tolerability immunogenicity bivalent vaccine compare clinical immunologic response document parallel study East African subject ( Uganda ) North American subject ( NIH , Bethesda , MD , USA ) . Objectives : - To see Ebola vaccine safe study immune response . - To study effect MVA-EbolaZ booster immune response Eligibility : - Healthy adult age 18-65 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase 1B , double-blind , randomize study examine safety , tolerability immunogenicity two different dosage level investigational Ebola vaccine . The vaccine recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus Type 3-vectored Ebolavirus vaccine ( cAd3-EBO ) , VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP . The vaccine encode wild type ( WT ) glycoprotein ( GP ) Zaire Sudan specie Ebola virus . The primary objective ass safety single dose intramuscular injection bivalent vaccine one 2 dosage level , 2.0 X 10 ( 10 ) vp 2 x 10 ( 11 ) vp assess safety heterologous prime boost regimen cAd3-EBO follow MVA-EbolaZ Phosphate Buffered Saline ( PBS ) placebo . A secondary objective ass immunogenicity generate 2 different dosage level bivalent Ebola candidate vaccine . Enrolment Group 1 participant : The first 20 Malian volunteer vaccinate staggered fashion . For safety reason , first 10 Malian subject receive vaccine dose Group 1 vaccinate day 1 wait 24 hour vaccinate 10 subsequent volunteer . After 20 volunteer Group 1 vaccinate follow 7 day , interim safety review ( ISR1 ) perform DSMB . Enrolment subject Group 2 commence DSMB assess data indicate safe . Half Group 1 participant randomly assign receive low dose remain 10 randomized receive high dose . Enrolment Group 2 participant : The 40 subject Group 2 accrue rapidly possible . The 40 Malian volunteer Group 2 vaccinate several day limit wastage available dos cAd3 EBO . As result , propose scheme would 10 per vaccination day . This could adjust needed limit wastage 20 participant would vaccinate 1 day . After total 40 volunteer Group 2 vaccinate follow 7 day , interim safety review ( ISR2 ) perform DSMB . Prime Boost Vaccine Randomization 4-16 week prim dose : Each participant offer opportunity include booster step study . After obtain consent additional review pertinent medical history , participant group randomize receive candidate booster vaccine , MVA-EbolaZ PBS placebo</detailed_description>
