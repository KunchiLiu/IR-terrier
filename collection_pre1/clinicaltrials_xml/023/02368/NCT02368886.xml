	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well lower-dose compare standard dose regorafenib work treat patient colorectal cancer spread primary site ( place start ) place body respond treatment . Regorafenib may stop growth colorectal cancer block growth new blood vessel necessary tumor growth block enzyme need cell growth . It yet know whether lower-dose standard dose regorafenib effective treating patient colorectal cancer . Clobetasol propionate steroid cream commonly use treat variety skin condition may help prevent hand-foot skin reaction patient receive regorafenib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lower Standard Dose Regorafenib Treating Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate proportion patient arm complete 2 cycle treatment intend initiate cycle 3 progression note planned 8-week scan . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate outcome measure efficacy arm include progression free survival ( PFS ) , time progression ( TTP ) , time failure ( TTF ) overall survival ( OS ) . II . Compare arm cumulative dose receive within first two cycle . III . Evaluate proportion patient arm exhibit grade 3 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome ( PPES ) and/or fatigue , make comparison regorafenib dose strategy pre-emptive vs. reactive strategy address PPES . IV . Compare quality life ( QOL ) treatment arm ( regorafenib dosing strategy preemptive vs. reactive PPES strategy ) measure Hand Foot Syndrome ( HFS ) 14 , Brief Fatigue Inventory ( BFI ) , Linear Analogue Self-Assessment ( LASA ) questionnaires . V. Compare need topical oral ( PO ) analgesia treatment arm ( regorafenib dose strategy pre-emptive vs. reactive PPES strategy ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate compare trough minimum concentration ( Cmin ) pharmacokinetics ( PK ) first 2 treatment cycle regorafenib active metabolite M2 , M5 low dose ( dose escalation ) standard dose cohort , correlate toxicity profile . II . Evaluate correlation PK parameter tumor response/stable disease first two cycle . III . Evaluate correlation PK parameter PFS OS . IV . Evaluate trough ( Cmin ) concentration associate patient-specific factor ( - limit - age concomitant medication ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM A1 : Patients receive lower-dose regorafenib PO daily ( QD ) day 1-21 pre-emptive clobetasol propionate give topically twice daily ( BID ) 12 week , begin day 1 regorafenib . ARM A2 : Patients receive lower-dose regorafenib PO Arm A1 reactive clobetasol propionate give topically BID begin day 1 per physician discretion upon occurrence PPES grade &gt; = 1 . ARM B1 : Patients receive standard dose regorafenib PO QD day 1-21 pre-emptive clobetasol propionate Arm A1 . ARM B2 : Patients receive standard dose regorafenib PO Arm B1 reactive clobetasol propionate Arm A2 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2-6 month .</detailed_description>
