	<detailed_description>`` 1 . `` Background Significance Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remain number one global cause death , account 17.3 million death per year , number expect grow 23.6 million 2030 . 80 % death occur low- middle-income country . These death usually young age compare high income country . CVD lead cause death China , responsible approximately 3.5 million ( 41 % ) death 2012 . Reflecting major contribution cerebrovascular disease vascular disease burden China , high blood pressure lead modifiable risk factor cardiovascular disease importance great rural northern region high blood pressure , salt consumption incidence stroke high . Given background , China Rural Health Initiative , large-scale , factorial , cluster-randomized , controlled trial conduct 120 village select 5 Northern Provinces ( Liaoning , Hebei , Shanxi , Shaanxi Ningxia ) rural China 2010 2012 . CRHI aim develop , implement evaluate effective , low-cost , sustainable intervention cardiovascular disease prevention management suitable widespread implementation rural China . Two intervention evaluate CRHI . One standard disease management program individual high risk cardiovascular disease deliver Primary Care Providers ( village doctor ) ( 'PCP ' hereafter ) . Another one community-based Salt Reduction program deliver community health educator ( 'SRS ' hereafter ) . A stratified randomization use assign villages 4 group : PCP , SRS , PCP SRS , usual care ( neither PCP SRS ) . For entire study , 60 village 'PCP ' 60 village 'no PCP ' ( without SRS ) 60 village 'SRS ' 60 village 'no SRS ' ( without PCP ) . For PCP intervention , period intervention 2 year ; SRS , approximately 1.5 year . And intervention end November , 2012 . High risk individual define meet one follow criterion , regardless current medication use : - Physician-diagnosed history coronary heart disease stroke ; - Older age ( 50 year old men ; 60 year old woman - `` 50+/60+ '' hereafter ) history diabetes ; - Older age ( 50+/60+ ) measure SBPâ‰¥160 mmHg A baseline post-intervention random sample survey ( 2 independent sample ) old adult ( 50+/60+ ) , 4800 , conduct 120 village intervention 10 12 week respectively . In village survey , survey collect data 40 consent age-eligible adult , half men half woman . As matter fact , 5050 4887 old adult participate baseline post-intervention survey respectively . The main result CRHI show SRS intervention significantly reduce sodium intake intervention compare control village , PCP intervention program significantly improve clinical care high risk patient term use primary care , provision lifestyle advice , use antihypertensive treatment use aspirin . Previous study show life style behavior intervention could longer term effect end study design evaluate intervention . For example , Daqing study China show intervention effect exist 14 year active intervention . The follow Trial Hypertension Prevention ( TOHP ) I II study participant , 10-15 year sodium reduction intervention trial , find risk cardiovascular event 25 % low among intervention group ( relative risk 0.75 , P=0.04 ) , adjust trial , clinic , age , race , sex . CRHI study intervention , SRS PCP , end two year provide good opportunity u understand whether effect could prolong long term . `` 2 . `` Aims To evaluate effect CRHI intervention , SRS PCP , 2 year end CRHI . `` 3 . `` Study Design This cohort follow-up survey . The baseline cohort 5050 post-intervention cohort 4887 CRHI participant randomly select 120 village 5 northern province ( Liaoning , Hebei , Shanxi , Shaanxi Ningxia ) rural China recruit follow study . Except died CRHI baseline post-intervention survey , CRHI survey participant contact informed consent obtain . The reason contact response document . A questionnaire derive CRHI baseline post-intervention survey use collect data disease history , medication use , care seek pattern , lifestyle factor . Weight , height , blood pressure heart rate measure standard way . The `` train trainer '' model use train survey interviewer . Only interviewer pass test participate field investigation . The field investigation carry September 2014 February 2015 5 Northern Provinces . After confirm identity obtain informed consent participant , interviewer begin collect information . The standard operating procedure develop followed whole process . Outcomes The primary outcome mean systolic blood pressure level among participant high risk . Secondary outcome ( among participant high-risk patient ) include : - Proportion individual regularly visit village clinic - Proportion individual receive lifestyle advice - Proportion individual treat blood pressure lower agent - Proportion individual treat aspirin - Proportion individual knowledge salt reduction - Proportion individual use low sodium salt - Proportion individual adopt healthy behavior - Proportion individual develop CVD event `` 4 . `` Quality control Intensive discussion protocol standard operating procedure make design phase study . And interviewer pass test participant field investigation . Moreover , instrument include sphygmomanometer weight scale purchase calibrate centrally . In investigation field , interviewer apply standard questionnaire follow standard operating procedure . Double entry use data entry analysis validate independent data analyst . `` 5 . `` Ethics review human subject protection The project review Ethics Committee Peking University Health Science Center Beijing , China . Written consent obtain participant research . All participant free quit study time explanation require . The risk participate study minimal .</detailed_description>
