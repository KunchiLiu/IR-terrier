	<detailed_description>Following consent , surgery determine physician thereby determine group assignment- i.e laparoscopic surgery group oror robotic assisted surgery group . Both group undergo SLN map instillation injection . The Laparotomy/Laparoscopy Group Lymphazurin injection instillation methylene blue dye . The Robot Assisted Group ICG injection instillation methylene blue . Patients undergo total hysterectomy , bilateral salpingoophorectomy , pelvic paraaortic lymphadenectomy laparotomy , laparoscopic robotic assist surgery clinically determine attend physician . Subjects undergo surgery whether enrol study . Any clinically indicate uterine manipulator acceptable . Potential subject inform potential risk device may make informed decision participation study . However manipulator standard care study relate risk . Subjects agree study procedure monitor adverse event . The dye use study commercially available provide internal funding CTCA Gynecology/Oncology Department . Potential subject inform potential risk drug may make informed decision participation study . Subjects agree study procedure monitor adverse event . After administration anesthesia , intra-uterine uterine manipulator catheter insert use follow suggested instruction use ; • After standard care vaginal prep povidone-iodine surgeon preference cleanse solution , expose cervix use vaginal speculum . No additional preparation cervix need . Immediately follow exposure pf cervix speculum , introduction intra-uterine uterine manipulator catheter , 4ml total isosulfan 1 % blue ICG ( depend route surgery elect ) dye deliver cervical injection follow : - Using 20 22 gauge spinal needle , inject dye cervix 12 , 3 , 6 9 o'clock position . - Each site receive approximately 1ml dye ½ superficial mucosa remainder approximately 1cm deep prior injection . The 22 gauge needle commercially available provide routine clinical care . Potential subject inform potential risk injection may make informed decision participation study . Subjects agree study procedure monitor adverse event . • Introduce uterine manipulator catheter trans-cervically distal balloon position low portion uterus . This different routine clinical care . Immediately follow cervical injection placement uterine manipulator intra-abdominal , first step surgery occlude fallopian tube , typically do part surgery , use electrocautery device ( e.g . Ligasure ) seal tube . Immediately follow occlusion fallopian tube , comparator instillation dye instill uterine cavity pre-inserted intra-uterine uterine manipulator catheter follow : - Insert clinically select uterine manipulator per standard clinical practice . - Slowly inject dye center uterine cavity catheter access port. , Rapid injection dye could cause high intrauterine pressure result extravasation . Use slow constant pressure instill dye . This do surgical assistant operate surgeon via long extension tubing . It estimate may take 40 minute dyes absorb surround tissue take lymphatic vessel turn node blue green . During time surgery proceed without delay . These study procedure increase estimate total time perform surgery . The surgery proceed routine sentinel node dissection . Briefly , regular dissection , visual identification dye take node specific anatomical distribution document use anatomical documentation sheet . Visual detection methylene isosulfan blue dye do investigator 's naked eye . Visual detection ICG dye include use charge-coupled device ( CCD ) camera call Spycam equip 3 main component ( near-infrared sensitive image intensifier , 16-bit dynamic-range frame transfer CCD camera light-emitting diode [ LEDs ] mount robotic surgical instrument . The Spycam direct onto operative field illuminate fluoresce dye green . The camera connect monitor image display screen analyze use digital imaging processing . Using clock surgery room reference , member surgical team record exact time elapse ( minute ) administration visual detection dye make technique . Blue/green node label sentinel node non-blue/green node label non-sentinel . Blue/green node also label describe dye detect ( methylene , isosulfan ICG ) . Differences dye deposition/absorption method ( injection vs. instillation ) document either detect detect node channel use color photography surgical setting . Continuous monitor do adverse event surgery post operatively time patient discharge hospital . All node sample histopathologically examine Hematoxylin Eosin ( H &amp; E ) Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) stain detect micro-metastasis . Analysis compare result instillation technique cervical injection technique subject sensitivity SLN mapping , estimate false negative predictive value , time detect SLNs , anatomical distribution SLNs , differences dye absorption use technique .</detailed_description>
