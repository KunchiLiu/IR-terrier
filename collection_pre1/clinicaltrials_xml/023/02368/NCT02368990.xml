	<brief_summary>The aim study collect real world information patient locally advance metastatic non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) progress first line treatment approve Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor ( TKI ) , know T790M positive prescribe second line platinum-based chemotherapy ( Pemetrexed + Cisplatin /Carboplatin ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T790M Mutation Positive 2nd Line STandard cAre Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study observational prospective cohort study plan enroll approximately 200 patient worldwide . There Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) mutation know associated EGFR-targeted TKI sensitivity ( Ex19Del , L858R , L861Q , G719X ) . Further test biopsied tissue cytology progression treatment approve EGFR target TKI use determine positivity T790M mutation . Primary objective study : - To estimate overall survival - To estimate disease progression ( assess define physician ) - To estimate time treatment line therapy - To describe time subsequent therapy ( death ) - To describe healthcare resource utilization pattern - To capture patient report symptom , function , health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) data use European Organization Research Treatment Cancer Quality Life Questionnaire - Core 30 item ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ) European Organisation Research Treatment Cancer Quality Life Questionnaire - Lung Cancer 13 item ( EORTC QLQ-LC13 ) - To describe use pemetrexed + cisplatin/carboplatin 2nd line treatment - To describe treatment pattern 3rd line treatment beyond</detailed_description>
