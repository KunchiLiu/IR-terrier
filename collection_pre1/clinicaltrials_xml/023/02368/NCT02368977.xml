	<brief_title>Third Eye Panoramic Device Feasibility Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate feasibility use Third Eye Panoramic device along standard colonoscope mean enhance ability endoscopists view area hide view colonoscope . Colonoscopy generally agree best method detect remove cancer pre-cancerous adenomas colon . However , numerous study demonstrate 22 % 40 % adenoma miss standard colonoscopy . More importantly , 12 % large adenoma ( least 1 cm ) miss even expert endoscopists use meticulous technique best available equipment , large adenoma one likely transform cancer . Factors quality bowel cleanse time spend examine colonic mucosa show affect miss rate . However , comparison result CT colonography show 2/3 missed adenoma locate behind fold wall colon , area difficult see standard forward-viewing colonoscope . When clip onto tip standard colonoscope , Third Eye Panoramic device provide two additional miniature video camera light source offer view leave side right side colonoscope 's tip . These lateral view complement forward view colonoscope 's camera result `` panoramic '' view 300Â° . This extreme wide-angle view allows endoscopist examine area locate behind fold . In study , subject undergo colonoscopy procedure utilizing Third Eye Panoramic device along standard colonoscope . The investigator evaluate issue relate usability safety base experience impression , telephone follow-up subject assess post-procedural complication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The patient undergo colonoscopy screening , surveillance followup previous polypectomy diagnostic workup . 2 . The patient must understand provide write consent procedure . 1 . Patients &gt; 75 year age ; 2 . Patients history colonic resection ; 3 . Patients suspect chronic stricture potentially preclude complete colonoscopy ; 4 . Patients diverticulitis toxic megacolon ; 5 . Patients history radiation therapy abdomen pelvis ; 6 . Patients currently enrol another clinical investigation intervention might compromise safety patient 's participation study .</criteria>
