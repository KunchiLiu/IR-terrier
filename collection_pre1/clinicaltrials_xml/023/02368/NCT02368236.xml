	<brief_summary>This study adapt test touch-screen computer program evaluate cancer risk provide patient-tailored recommendation appropriate risk-based testing . This individually tailor intervention deliver right point primary care prior office visit , helpful non-obstructive adjunct clinical care . The primary aim project test whether tailor intervention promote risk-appropriate cancer test result increase participation compare simple non-tailored reminder reminder . The trial design determine extent Cancer Risk Intake System ( CRIS ) facilitate ( 1 ) participation risk-appropriate colorectal cancer testing , document electronic medical record audit ; ( 2 ) patient receipt risk-appropriate colorectal cancer test recommendation physician , document electronic medical record audit ; ( 3 ) change patient ' intent participate risk-appropriate colorectal cancer testing , document patient report . The Family Community Medicine General Internal Medicine clinic database use identify potentially eligible patient upcoming scheduled appointment . Because physician unit random assignment , patient cod study invitation potential participant intervention comparison group . A random sample eligible intervention comparison group patient select contact . Identified patient mail letter practice sign physician request participation . The letter describe `` study beliefs practice cancer prevention early detection '' provide toll-free number refuse contact . One week mailing , patient call refuse contact call study staff explain study , verify eligibility , patient agrees , arrange in-person meeting clinic 30 minute prior appointment . These call make trained research assistant follow standard call protocol . After consent , participant complete computerize data collection ( CRIS ) immediately prior schedule primary-care appointment . Intervention group patient physicians receive printout recommend risk-appropriate colorectal test way overcome perceived barrier test . A member research team hand patient printout deliver printout physician . Comparison group patient physicians receive non-tailored printout simple reminder test . The investigator also establish true no-contact control conduct retrospective chart review randomly select patient receive invitation participate study . This no-contact control establish baseline screen rate . The investigator conduct analysis comparison intervention group see individual participate CRIS high screen rate colorectal cancer compare non-contact group . These additional data help u good ass study Aims 1 2 .</brief_summary>
