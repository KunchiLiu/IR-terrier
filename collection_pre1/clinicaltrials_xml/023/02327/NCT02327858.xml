	<brief_summary>According World Health Organisation , depression problem drinking among leading cause disability worldwide . Most patient present problem drinking and/or depression poor quality life pose great economic burden society due high use health service . We seek develop new , enhanced , efficient , innovative cost effective treatment strategy aim reduce burden two mental condition impose sufferer , family well community health system . In recent pilot study supportive text message Ireland conduct Principal Applicant team researcher patient problem drink co-occurring depression , establish patient receive twice daily supportive text message three month significantly less depressive symptom receive message . There also trend patient receive supportive text message likely high alcohol free day receive supportive text messages.Our study limit small number participant examine impact text message health service utilization . Our study also examine effect supportive text message depression problem drinking .

	<brief_title>Supportive Text Messages Reduce Mood Symptoms Problem Drinking- Randomised Controlled Pilot Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression Alcohol Use Disorders ( AUDs ) lead cause disability worldwide associate significant treatment challenge especially occur concurrently ( 1 ) . Concurrent challenge include : Higher rate lifetime drug dependence ( 2 ) ; bad outcome among enter treatment alcohol drug misuse ( 3 ) ; high relapse follow AUD treatment among adolescent ( 4 ) adult ( 5 ) ; great severity suicidality adult ( 6 ) high likelihood suicide attempt ( 7 ) complete suicide ( 8 ) . Because seek develop complimentary enhance , efficient , innovative cost effective treatment strategy aim reduce burden disorder impose service user , care giver , community Alberta Health Services . Using mobile phone technology ( 9 ) . In pilot trial In Ireland , participant concurrent depression AUD complete in-patient dual diagnosis treatment program randomise receive twice daily supportive text message two weekly thank text message three month . That trial show supportive text message improve symptom depression ( Beck Depression Inventory score ) compare receive standard care . There also trend towards increase Cumulative Abstinence Duration ( CAD ) supportive text message group ( 10 ) . The pilot trial Ireland explore effect supportive text message individual disorder occur alone , although would reasonable assume would benefit equally . A recent study JAMA Psychiatry ( 11 ) ( randomise patient leave residential treatment alcohol use disorder receive either smart-phone application support recovery addition treatment usual treatment usual ) report 8 month intervention 4 month follow-up , patient smart phone application support group report significantly few risky drinking day patient control group . In review text message clinical healthy behaviour intervention , Wei et al . ( 2011 ) find among sixteen randomize controlled trial , ten report significant improvement intervention six report difference suggest positive trend ( 12 ) . Overall Aim : To conduct randomise controlled pilot trial determine effectiveness supportive text message reduce mood symptom problem drinking patient Depression and/or AUD respectively . Specific objective : 1 . To compare mean change Beck 's Depression Inventory ( BDI ) baseline patient Depression receive supportive text message receive supportive text message . 2 . To compare Cumulative Abstinence Duration ( CAD ) baseline patient AUD receive supportive text message receive supportive text messages.. Hypotheses : Supportive text message : 1 . Reduce change BDI score baseline patient Depression least mean 30 % patient intervention group compare control group . 2 . Increase CAD patient AUD least 30 % . Study design setting : This longitudinal , prospective , parallel design , two arm , placebo-controlled single-rater-blinded randomized clinical trial recruitment period 6 month observation period 3 month participant two stratum base primary diagnosis Major Depressive Disorder AUD . Patients AUD recruit complete Northern Addiction Residential Treatment programme locate Grande Prairie patient Depression recruit assessed wait-listing onto Cognitive Behaviour Therapy ( CBT ) program run Adult Mental Health Team Fort McMurray . Ethics approval seek participant provide inform write consent prior randomization . Recruitment : All patient complete Northern Addiction Residential Treatment programme locate Grande Prairie assess psychiatrist Fort McMurray fulfil inclusion criterion invite participate . This minimize source referral confounding factor . Information leaflets provide consenting recruit . The Structured Clinical Interview Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders { DSM-5 } ( SCID ) use screen confirm diagnosis study participant prior inclusion study . Randomisation blinding : Randomisation stratify primary diagnosis ( Depression AUD ) use permute block ensure balance ( 1:1 ) treatment control group within condition study . The randomisation code transmit independent statistician researcher send text message , immediately participant sign informed consent dedicate password protect phone line secure online backup message . The researcher send text message involve outcome assessment except contact receive supportive text message feedback benefit text message . Participants blind treatment allocation make explicit . Outcome assessor blind treatment group allocation . To ensure , treatment allocation conceal outcome assessor block access database contain randomization code , participant study ask reveal treatment allocation assessor . Outside assessment , outcome assessor participate discussion participant study forum . To test success blind ask assessor guess allocation group participant 3 month follow-up . Moreover , assessor also involve data analysis . After data collection complete data undergo blind review purpose finalize plan analysis . Every effort take avoid incomplete data method deal unanticipated miss data decide upon blind review data . Intervention : Patients intervention group receive twice daily supportive text message 3 month . The message tailor towards improve mood , compliance medication target abstinence alcohol accordance primary aim study . As far possible , majority text message reflect lesson patient usually learn CBT addiction counsel session . They send specify time centralised computer program set monitor one research assistant . Some sample text message outline Table 2 . To safeguard patient confidentiality identifiable patient information transmit via text message . The patient also receive phone call every two week research assistant treatment allocation confirm still receive text message also thank take part study . Patients control group receive text message also receive phone call researcher every two week thank take part study . The aim help increase retention rate study . Sample size : Consistent idea exploratory study , research use data elicit participant enrol within exist resource , principle describe Haynes et al . ( 2005 ) use `` patient I get '' ( 13 ) . The study therefore limit pilot trial sample size 120 , 30 patient two primary diagnosis ( Depression AUD ) base intervention group another 30 patient two primary diagnosis base nonintervention group . Follow-up assessment : At 3 month , blind researcher ( probably research psychologist ) contact patient phone assist complete range assessment tool relate primary secondary outcome measure . Administrative data relate cost health service utilisation day absent work patient also source compile . Those AUD also direct dedicated laboratory blood test relate secondary outcome measure . Statistical method : Analysis primary secondary outcome variable do intention-to-treat basis , use generalise linear mixed model ( GLMM ) . Patients withdraw study lose follow-up primary , endpoint administrative data include analysis per consent provide prior randomization unless consent explicitly withdraw . Missing data outcome variable adequately account use GLMM . Analyses stratify diagnosis group , provide evidence interaction treatment group diagnosis group ( i.e . effect treatment differs accord diagnosis group ) . Subsequent analysis examine difference two treatment group within quarterly period , use time 4 category variable , since effect time unlikely linear , use interaction treatment group time . Economic decision model approach use test sensitivity acceptability incremental cost cost-effectiveness result ( 14 , 16 ) .</detailed_description>
