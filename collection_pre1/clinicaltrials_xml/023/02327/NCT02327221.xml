	<detailed_description>During double-blinded phase , treatment consist 2 intravenous ( i.v . ) administrations antigen-specific autologous T regulatory cell placebo : - Group A : 1.10e4 cell 1.10e4 cell - Group B : 1.10e6 cell 1.10e6 cell - Group C : 1.10e7 cell 1.10e7 cell - Group D : Placebo Placebo During double-blinded phase , two i.v . administration study drug ( Ova-Treg ) administer , one week 0 another one week 8 group A , B C. Two injection Placebo administer , one week 0 ( V4 ) another one week 8 group D. During double-blinded phase , patient follow 16 week . This follow additional period 16 week patient expect receive two additional administration Ovasave 10e6 cell dose ( Open-label phase ) , except refuse patient recommend Investigator , represent follow-up phase . These third fourth administration perform group ( A , B , C D ) injection Ovasave 1.10e6 cell administer week 16 week 24 . A patient n't receive 2 first administration double-blinded phase receive third fourth administration Open-label phase .</detailed_description>
