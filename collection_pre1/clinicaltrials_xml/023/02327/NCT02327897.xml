	<brief_summary>Background : - Asthma serious clinical public health problem . Researchers want collect data well understand bacteria thing environment affect people 's asthma . Eligibility : - Nonsmoking adult age 18 - 60 moderate severe asthma pregnant breastfeeding . Design : - Partaicipants complete medical history form first visit . - Study visit include collect medical history , conduct physical exam , lung smoking test . Participants give blood , urine , stool , dust , saliva , sputum sample . - Participants take test measure breathe ability . They give saliva sample DNA study . They get kit collect stool dust sample home . They fill survey . - Participants visit every 6 month 5 year . They schedule sick visit , need , cost participant . For visit , asthma check-ups get treatment , cost participant . - Some participant may take part sub-study include one 4-hour visit . They medical history , physical exam , lung test . They urine test check pregnancy tobacco exposure . Then bronchoscopy . For , intravenous line place arm vein . The nose throat numb . A flexible fiber-optic tube insert airway nose . Their airway examine area lung wash . A small sample cell take .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NHALES ( Natural History Asthma With Longitudinal Environmental Sampling )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , longitudinal , observational , single-center , exploratory , natural history study collect sample data enable prospective exploration interaction environmental exposure disease progression time moderate-severe atopic asthmatic persistent disease , facilitate formation mechanistic hypothesis . Environmental body microbiome sample collect stored participant future correlation effect asthma symptom control . Samples blood , urine , DNA , saliva , sputum , stool , household dust collect approximately 200 participant , well quality life information use asthma symptom questionnaire . Additionally , sample collect airway approximately 20 participant enrol bronchoscopy sub-study . The sample survey information collect may use explore microbiological genetic influence atopic asthma . Data analyse sample survey response may evaluate context environmental exposure , clinical outcome ( symptom , exacerbation , quality life ) , response therapy . Male female participant age 18 60 year old moderate-severe , symptomatic atopic asthma enrol . Participants exclude enrollment history chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , cystic fibrosis , non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis , pulmonary fibrosis , pulmonary hypertension , emphysema , sarcoidosis , unstable angina . Additionally , participant exclude DVT , pulmonary embolism , class III IV congestive heart failure , malignancy treatment . Current smoker , individual allergic methacholine , woman pregnant breastfeeding , eligible enroll . Women become pregnant start breastfeed complete screen baseline visit assessment may continue participation study eligible participate bronchoscopy sub-study . Participants enrol five year receive standard care asthma therapy indicate . After initial screen baseline visit , participant return visit semi-annually sick visit need . Volunteers participate bronchoscopy sub-study additional single visit complete baseline visit . This cohort 200 participant form basis future asthma study recruitment , analysis collect sample data . Further expansion study beyond five year 200 participant desirable logistically possible .</detailed_description>
