	<brief_summary>Background : - Salivary gland around mouth throat make saliva . Salivary gland disorder affect person quality life . Studying people disease affect salivary gland ( ) may teach researcher disorder genetics . Objectives : - To study salivary gland diseases disorder . To collect data sample people salivary gland problem relatives . Eligibility : - People 4 year old suspect disease involve salivary gland . - Their relative 4 year old . - Healthy volunteer 18 year old . Design : - Participants may screen : - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood urine test - General oral dental history exam - Saliva collection - Eye exam test dry eye - Health questionnaire ( adult ) - Biopsy minor salivary gland . A small incision make inside low lip several tiny salivary gland remove . - Participants 2 3 visit . These may include : - Repeats screen test - Ultrasounds gland . Researchers put gel face , press smooth wand . - Adults may biopsies - A small catheter insert open parotid gland duct inside cheek . A saline solution ( syringe ) fill duct . - Swishing saltwater solution mouth 10 second spit cup - Scrapings collect teeth , tongue , cheek</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol intend allow disease-specific investigation subject presentation disease salivary gland involvement enable collection data , biological fluid tissue sample subject , family member normal control , order assist study understand salivary gland disease pathophysiology . The exocrine salivary gland , secrete saliva , play critical role homeostasis oral cavity , initial part gastrointestinal track . Several disease include Parkinson systemic amyloidosis diagnose biopsy easily accessible salivary gland . Moreover , several drug systemic disease cause salivary gland hypofunction unknown mechanism . We may evaluate participant complaint dry mouth determine cause severity salivary gland dysfunction possible eligibility NIDCR protocol . Salivary secretion antibacterial , lubricating , remineralizing , digestive , buffer cleanse property . Impaired function gland cause increase tooth decay ; variety oral hard soft tissue change , painful , burn ulcerated oral mucosa ; problem chew , swallow speaking ; diminish taste smell . This protocol provide u opportunity learn variety pathology involve directly indirectly salivary gland , expand knowledge disorder provide access patient interest research , teaching , clinical experience . Information obtain protocol may lead potential innovative therapeutic study . In addition role investigate individual interest Sj ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren syndrome ( SS ) Salivary Gland Dysfunction Unit MPTB NIDCR , protocol provide possible avenue enrol subject NIH program NIH protocol exhibit sign symptom associate salivary gland dysfunction .</detailed_description>
