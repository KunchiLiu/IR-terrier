	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) accelerate vascular stiffen related age . Arterial stiffness may evaluate measure carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) simply , recommend KDOQI , monitor pulse pressure ( PP ) . Both correlate survival incidence cardiovascular disease . PWV also estimate brachial artery use Mobil-O-Graph ; non-operator dependent automatic device . The aim analyse whether , dialysis population , PWV obtain Mobil-O-Graph ( MogPWV ) sensitive vascular age PP . A cohort 143 patient 4 dialysis unit follow measure MogPWV PP every 3 6 month compare control group non-CKD patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic hemodialysis patient arterial stiffness evaluate monthly use Pulse Pressure suggest KDOQI guideline [ 1 ] . This recommendation pursue dual goal since outline importance monitoring vascular stiffness hemodialysis patient [ 2-4 ] , time , emphasize fact Pulse Pressure provide valuable information tissue perfusion characteristic [ 5 ] . Arterial stiffen dialysis patient result age , non-specific End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) relate risk factor , medial calcification , volume overload , uraemia-related endothelial dysfunction , increase extracellular matrix intimal fibroelastic thickening [ 6 ] . Arterial stiffness aorta major branch evaluate measure Pulse Wave Velocity ( PWV ) - e.g . carotid-femoral Pulse Wave Velocity ( `` gold standard '' ) [ 7 ] - , alternatively , estimate Pulse Wave Analysis ( PWA ) peripheral site , usually brachial artery [ 8-11 ] . In first case , doppler ultrasound detector use together software tool data analysis . The second approach require use sphygmomanometer , Mobil-O-Graph , capable analyse pulse wave morphology calculate PWV [ 9-14 ] . The first methodology complex , operator-dependent routinely applicable , whereas second one potentially usable clinical practice [ 9 ] . The increase PWV relate above-mentioned risk factor also accelerate age [ 7 ] . Both PWV PP correlate mortality dialysis population [ 15-17 ] : PWV increase 1 m/s Blacher et al . find all-cause mortality-adjusted OR 1.39 ( 95 % CI , 1.19 1.62 ) [ 16 ] 10 mmHg increase PP , Tozawa et al . found increase all-cause mortality relative risk 8 % [ 17 ] . Risk factor age , hypertension , previous history heart diseases diabetes influence evolution Pulse Wave Velocity dialysis initiation whereas impact course dialysis yet demonstrate [ 18 ] . In regard , study publish 2013 Utescu et al . indicate risk factor significantly associate PWV progression level advance glycation end-product know pentosidine [ 18 ] . The result study confirm specific uraemia-related risk factor identify possibly quantify . In above-mentioned study , rate PWV progression ( +0.84 m/s per year ) surprisingly high , especially projected time function average life span ESRD patient dialysis . Another critical data point outline study discrepancy annual rate change carotid-femoral compare carotid-radial Pulse Wave Velocity , +0.84 m/s per year -0.66 m/s per year , respectively . The author study postulate discrepancy may due anatomical difference central ( elastic ) peripheral ( muscular ) artery latter could deploy adaptive response central aortic stiffening . Although interesting , data raise concern promise possibility use brachial artery site PWV estimation , even base non-operator dependent method . Furthermore , another limitation identify literature currently available prospective longitudinal study analyse PWV behaviour dialysis patient , lack control group make patient similar characteristic co-morbidities without kidney failure [ 2,16,18 ] . In light , decide test Mobil-O-Graph , simple device estimate PWV ( MogPWV ) modify sphygmomanometer brachial artery analyse baseline follow-up MogPWV value cohort dialysis patient control group risk factor without kidney failure . The aim study answer follow 4 question , also reflect primary secondary endpoint trial : 1 . Does PWV estimate Mobil-O-Graph brachial artery , sensitive vascular age good discriminate dialysis population control group pulse pressure ? ( primary endpoint ) ; 2 . Is MogPWV progression faster dialysis pre-dialysis setting ? ( secondary endpoint ) ; 3 . Are specific risk factor correlate MogPWV progression ? ( secondary endpoint ) ; 4 . Does mortality correlate MogPWV ? ( secondary endpoint ) .</detailed_description>
