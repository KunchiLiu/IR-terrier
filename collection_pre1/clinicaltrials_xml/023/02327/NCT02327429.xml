	<brief_summary>In Canada , fast-growing population diabetes , majority diabetes case type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . Diabetes complication , cardiovascular disease , eye disease foot disease , impair quality life life expectancy . Chinese second large visible minority Canada . The diabetes incidence increase much rapidly Canadian population Chinese origin compare European origin past decade . Cultural factor likely affect individual behaviour diabetes treatment . Both international Canadian diabetes organization recognize importance take account cultural background individual preference diabetes treatment . However , lack cultural relevant nutritional recommendation guideline Chinese Canadians except literally translate material may culturally relevant . In order fill gap , investigator develop Chinese menu plan include commonly consume Chinese dish nutrient breakdown cook tip provide guidance patient daily meal planning . This menu plan cultural translation Canadian nutritional guideline , urgently need among Chinese immigrant T2D Edmonton , accord previous need assessment . In pilot test , investigator examine feasibility effectiveness Chinese menu plan . Twenty Chinese T2D Edmonton recruit use menu plan 3 consecutive month relevant index T2D test indicator effectiveness .

	<detailed_description>1 . Objectives The objective study assess feasibility Chinese menu plan Chinese immigrant type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , assess effectiveness menu plan term nutrient intake , glycemic control , weight management biochemical index . 2 . Background 2.1 Prevalence diabetes According Statistics Canada , diabetes population 2010 increase 39.0 % compare 2005 , total population increase 4.8 % five year . Diabetes sixth lead cause death Canada bring complication cardiovascular , renal , foot eye disease , cause disability reduction life expectancy . T2D comprise 90 % diabetes population worldwide , largely result excess body weight physical inactivity . Ethnic Chinese second large visible minority Canada , comprise 3.9 % 5.2 % total population Canada Edmonton , respectively . It report Chinese Canadians high risk diabetes . This warrant attention diabetes management among ethnic Chinese Canada . 2.2 Importance culturally relevant intervention Self-care chronic disease well facilitate cultural competence congruency incorporate management approach . Both international Canadian guideline recognize importance individualize treatment base culture .

Exclusion criterion : severe gastrointestinal renal problem would preclude eat accord Nutrition Therapy Guidelines Diabetes . 3.1 Baseline assessment Before 12-week intervention , baseline assessment conduct participant , include measurement A1C , height , weight , waist circumference body composition . Fasting blood sample collect lipid profile measurement . Demographic characteristic , diabetes treatment , self-care activity , physical activity perceive dietary adherence assess use questionnaire . Participants three-day food record dietary intake analysis . 3.2 Adoption Participants ask follow menu plan 12 week keep weekly record use menu plan . Goal set applied facilitate adoption . During first four week , study coordinator hold one-on-one weekly interview participant provide feedback education menu plan . Obstacles strategy discuss . During last eight week , one interview per month schedule address problem participant may help monitor goal achievement . Participants ask complete another 3-day food record last week test . 3.3 Final assessment After study completion , A1C , weight , waist circumference body composition measure within 1 week . A fasting blood sample collect measure lipid profile . Some baseline questionnaire include diabetes treatment perceive dietary adherence repeat , exit survey complete . The final three-day food record collect participant . Focus group conduct gather information participant ' experience perceive benefit , barrier facilitator follow menu plan . Feedback collect one reference possible modification menu plan . 3.4 Follow-up Email telephone follow-up conduct 2 month study completion document whether participant continue use menu plan . This one indicator long-term feasibility menu plan .</detailed_description>
