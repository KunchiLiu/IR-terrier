	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial compare pharmacokinetic characteristic GLA5PR GLARS tablet 150mg Lyrica Capsule 75mg . GLA5PR GLARS tablet 150mg New Formulation make GL Pharm Tech . GLARS ( Geometrically Long Absorption Regulated System ) New Solution Sustained Absorption Extending Absorption Site . To overcome shortcoming currently exist sustain release drug delivery technology investigator recently develop novel drug delivery system enable drug dissolve irrespective surround environment absorb colon . The investigator coin `` Geometrically Long Absorption Regulated System ( GLARS ) '' .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Open-label , Single Dose , Parallel Study Evaluate Pharmacokinetics Dose Proportionality GLA5PR GLARS-NF1 Tablet Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basically , system triple-layered tablet , comprise upper low layer swell draw sufficient amount water , plus highly water - soluble middle layer rapidly draw water tablet core simultaneously . The water drawn tablet ( 3 4 time weight tablet ) function additional medium enable additional later drug release dosage form . This serve overcome shortage surround medium report one key reason mal-absorption drug colon . As middle layer induces rapid water draw tablet core , penetrated water also diffuse upper low layer , make tablet rapidly swell control drug release . At virtually time , swell upper low layer form surround lateral side middle layer , , turn , control drug release . This relatively rigid swollen matrix structure make drug release affect surround mechanical flux , provide relatively consistent vivo drug release irrespective degree gastrointestinal motility .</detailed_description>
