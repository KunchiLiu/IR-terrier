	<brief_summary>Chronic low back pain ( cLBP ) one common disable condition among US military Veterans . Although physical activity improve cLBP outcome , majority Veterans cLBP inactive . Therefore VA need effective program help old Veterans cLBP increase physical activity improve associate outcomes . This particularly relevant old Veterans cLBP great risk functional limitation . The propose project pilot study telephone-based physical activity program physical activity combine cognitive behavioral pain management old adult Veterans cLBP . Older Veterans particular interest prior study physical activity cLBP address vulnerable patient group . This study also inform VA whether certain patient cLBP , great pain sensitivity , may benefit treatment supplement physical activity program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic low back pain ( cLBP ) one common disable condition among US military Veterans , prevalence rise even rapidly chronic condition diabetes hypertension . Studies show physical activity ( PA ) improve outcome patient cLBP , major gap research lack study focus old adult ; patient sample primarily middle-aged include patient ' age 65 year . Therefore , investigator ' lack evidence base feasibility effectiveness PA intervention vulnerable group patient cLBP . This particularly important give accumulate evidence show old adult cLBP significant low extremity functional limitation , result difficulty perform necessary daily task . Another area limit investigation among old adult cLBP whether added benefit incorporate cognitive behavioral therapy pain management ( CBT-P ) skills PA intervention . CBT-P help restructure pain perception improve pace PA . Some patient cLBP respond favorably isolate PA intervention , possible heighten pain sensitization may underlie lack response patient . Since CBT-P show alter pain processing , old adult cLBP great pain sensitization may respond good program combine PA CBT-P ( vs. PA alone ) ; however , study . This information practical implication large trial determine whether subset patient great central pain sensitivity may need additional intervention supplement PA program . The investigator conduct pilot study 12-week home-based PA PA + CBT-P program , weekly telephone support , compare wait list control group . Participants 60 old Veterans ( age 65 ) cLBP . Enrollment participant occur via referral geriatric primary care clinic Durham VAMC . The PA program comprehensive , include stretching , strengthen , aerobic activity , specific type intensity activity gear toward old adult . The CBT-P program include five different skill , woven telephone-based session , specific application PA cLBP . Both intervention jointly deliver physical therapist exercise counselor , complementary area expertise ( e.g. , train clinical exercise prescription motivational interviewing skill encourage PA adherence , respectively ) . Telephone call involve patient-specific goal-setting address barrier PA CBT-P skill . Participants receive booklet instruction photograph stretch strengthening exercise , well exercise video appropriate old adult cLBP . Participants combine intervention also receive write audio instruction regard CBT-P skill . Feasibility measure include proportion complete intervention call , adherence home-based PA recommendation CBT-P skill use , participant feedback program . Outcomes assessed baseline 12-week follow-up . Primary measure efficacy assessment general physical function , objective self-reported ( PROMIS Health Assessment Questionnaire ) . Secondary outcome include measure cLBP-specific pain disability . Central pain sensitivity assess via Pain Pressure Threshold ( PPT ) test Central Sensitization Inventory ( CSI ) . Statistical analysis include comparison baseline follow-up outcome across study group , well examination potential trend differential intervention response accord baseline PPT CSI score .</detailed_description>
