	<brief_title>Age-related Changes Immune System Their Impact Elderly Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite high relevance ageing/immunosenescence frailty oncogeriatric practice , immuno-senescence marker far consider concert clinical tumor characteristic profile tumor infiltrate leukocyte . In proposed project , investigator examine immunosenescence marker blood characterize leukocyte infiltrate tumor microenvironment set elderly breast cancer . The main goal project thus investigate relation interaction follow 3 aspect : ( ) immune status host : chronological age immunosenescence peripheral blood ; ( ii ) tumor microenvironment : local immune response ( evaluated via assessment amount nature tumor infiltrate leukocyte [ TIL ] ) ; ( iii ) clinical tumor characteristic : tumor size , grade , receptor status , lymph node involvement . To realize project , investigator set prospective clinical study comprise three distinct age category breast cancer patient integrate variety immunosenescence marker . Different specific manifestation immune system age study : age-related pro-inflammatory status ( inflammageing ) , increased expression senescence marker p16INK4a T lymphocytes , shift subset composition PBMC pool , age-associated change expression immune-related gene PBMC alter abundance specific ageing-related plasma microRNAs . At tumor microenvironmental level , leukocyte infiltrate study detail . The profile tumor-infiltrating immune cell compare distinct age group correlate systemic marker ageing/immunosenescence ( blood ) tumor biology , particularly lymph node involvement . Concrete research question : - How different immunosenescence marker ( i.e . subset profile PBMC , pro-inflammatory marker plasma , lymphocyte senescence evidence p16INK4a expession T lymphocytes , expression immune-related gene PBMC abundance ageing-related circulate microRNAs ) correlate patient 's calendar age ? - Does local immune response tumor ( amount nature TIL ) correlate different immunosenescence marker ? - Is relationship tumor biology , particularly lymph node involvement , local immune response tumor ? With study , investigator intend improve fundamental understand age-related change general immune status tumor-specific immune response impact tumor progression . This may add recent advance newly emerge therapeutic strategy , immune-related approach . Due recent advance biology genomics , become possible personalize individual 's cancer treatment base molecular tumor characteristic . In elderly , however , host factor also become increasingly important may influence tumor behavior/progression therapy tolerance/response . Therefore , good understand biological mechanism underlie ageing/immunosenescence , association cancer potential prognostic/predictive information patient 's ageing/immunosenescence profile provide mandatory .</detailed_description>
