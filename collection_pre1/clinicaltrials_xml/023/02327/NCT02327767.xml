	<brief_summary>The goal project test device ( Zondervan et al , 2013 ) provide active assistance arm training people Vietnam severe moderate stroke , also simple rely powered actuator . The hypothesis individual severe chronic stroke , exercise mechanically passive rehabilitation device , improve arm movement ability without experience increase arm pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Mechanically Passive Rehabilitation Device Vietnam : Impact Upper Extremity Hemiparesis After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomize control trial design compare two arm , consist Resonating Arm Exerciser ( RAE ) standard Physical Therapy ( PT ) , subject receiving treatment . Randomization use determine order subject receive treatment ; i.e . RAE follow PT , PT follow RAE . At scheduled test period , purpose procedure study explain via medical translator employ hospital . The subject ask read sign two copy Bill Rights Informed Consent Form . The researcher retain one copy purpose research record second copy give subject . Interview score Mini Mental Status Exam determine subject 's inclusion , order participant 's cognitive state intact capability follow direction , give consent , participate , communicate directly indirectly translator investigator . Administration Upper Extremity-Fugl Meyer Assessment ( UE-FMA ) administer next subject eligibility . Any additional question ask subject answered testing begin . Translators researcher available assist survey administration completion , maximum time allot survey . Any subject meet inclusion criterion thank release study . Subjects meet criterion , continue Wong Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale ( WBFRPS ) Stroke Impact Scale ( SIS ) SIS proxy version subject unable read write independently . INTERVENTION Simple random sample use allocate 30 eligible participant either treatment group control group . The treatment group use RAE 3 week , whereas control group continue exist physical therapy treatment passive range motion ( PROM ) therapeutic exercise involve upper extremity hospital physical therapist . The treatment group participate supervise RAE group session 45 minute , three time week , total eight session three consecutive week . During treatment session , affect upper extremity use push lever RAE sagittal plane . Upon push pull lever , wheelchair move total 20 cm neutral position , indicated repetition count programed iphone . Researchers continuously monitor treatment group ensure compliance use RAE , refrain compensatory trunk movement address patient discomfort . After four session RAE , elastic band connect device stretch increased length , order increase stiffness continue use . At completion three week , participant control treatment group perform UE-FMA , SIS , WBFPRS post-treatment measurement . The continued presence medical translator utilize UE-FMA question participant might SIS WBFPRS . Following data collection , participant switch group . Subjects experimental group become control group receive normal physical therapy treatment hospital PT additional three week . The treatment group participate supervise RAE group session increments 45 minute , three time week , total eight session three consecutive week . They supervise two senior license physical therapist Hospital , train researcher study . Their training include proper use RAE data collection outcome measure . Intra-rater inter-rater reliability establish use UE-FMA , prior data collection . At conclusion six-week study , participant perform UE-FMA , SIS , WBFPRS . During six-week duration study , on-site medical professional on-site translator present , protect medical complication language barrier . Subjects able refuse drop point study without repercussion continue receive uninterrupted medical care hospital .</detailed_description>
