	<brief_title>A Comparison Bed Rest Versus Moderate Activity Preterm Premature Rupture Membranes ( PPROM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historically , bed rest consider beneficial treatment option patient high risk pregnancy . The definition bed rest varies provider , mean anything completely bed-bound month time ( sometimes call strict bed rest ) walk around within home time day ( sometimes call modify bed rest ) . Recent study highlight potential harmful effect bed rest . However , scientific study need carry compare effect bed rest moderate activity health mother baby . PPROM define rupture membrane prior 37 week gestation prior onset labor , affect approximately 3 % pregnancy Unites States . Women PPROM routinely manage inpatient setting time diagnosis delivery . Therefore , PPROM patient closely supervise easily accessible cohort woman . In study , participate patient PPROM randomize two group : bedrest moderate activity . Maternal mood muscle strength assess enrollment delivery determine whether significant difference outcomes two group .</detailed_description>
