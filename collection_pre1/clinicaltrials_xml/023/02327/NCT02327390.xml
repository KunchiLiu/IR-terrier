	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study safety best dose ex-vivo activate lymph node lymphocyte ( X-ACT ) well well immune system respond X-ACT treatment participant stage IIIC-IV melanoma . X-ACT treatment involve remove participant 's lymph node ( ) close melanoma tumor . These lymph node contain special kind cell ( call T cell ) activate ( get cell start certain response immune system ) outside body approve laboratory . The activated T cell inject back participant use i.v . help participant 's immune system target melanoma . The participant undergo regular blood test determine whether X-ACT treatment result change immune system also whether T cell give back patient persist blood stream time . In addition , effect X-ACT treatment growth shrinkage participant 's melanoma measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety toxicity profile repeat infusion ex-vivo activate tumor-draining lymphocyte ( X-ACT ) participant advance melanoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess feasibility multiple infusion X-ACT . II . Assess effect dose schedule immunologic parameter use two novel biomarkers . III . Observe clinical outcome participant receive X-ACT therapy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . STEP 1 : Participants undergo lymph node biopsy collection least one melanoma-draining lymph node ( MDLN ) . MDLN cell cryopreserved aliquot need generate activate T cell culture . STEP 2 : Cryopreserved lymph node cell thaw undergo activation anti-cluster differentiation ( CD ) 3/anti-CD28 microbeads . The culture undergo expansion 14-18 day presence recombinant human interleukin-2 anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody . The activated X-ACT cell transfer i.v . participant derive additional therapy .</detailed_description>
