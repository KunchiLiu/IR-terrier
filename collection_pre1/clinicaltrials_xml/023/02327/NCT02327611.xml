	<brief_summary>Postoperative renal failure significant risk factor early mortality elective surgical repair thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm ( TAAAs ) . To prevent damage relate kidney ischemia aortic crossclamping TAAA repair , recent guideline recommend use cold crystalloid blood perfusion . Since study crystalloid solution Ringer 's lactate solution , consider standard care evaluate effectiveness substrate . An histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate enriched crystalloid solution name Custodiol ( Dr. Franz Kohler Chemie GmbH , Bensheim , Germany ) currently use organ preservation transplantation cardioplegia open-heart surgery EU country . This solution may provide good grade renal protection ischemic damage standard crystalloid solution . A recent observational study publish group suggest low incidence postoperative renal kidney injury patient undergo open TAAA surgical repair use renal perfusion Custodiol , compare perfuse enriched Ringer 's lactate solution . Objective study confirmation promise finding effectiveness renal perfusion Custodiol repair TAAA compare crystalloid . The study prospective , single-center , randomize , double-blind , control trial , investigate Acute Kidney Injury patient undergo TAAA open repair use Custodiol renal perfusion versus enrich Ringer 's lactate solution . It expect enroll adult patient undergo elective TAAA open repair . Participants follow duration hospital stay , expect average 2 week .</brief_summary>
