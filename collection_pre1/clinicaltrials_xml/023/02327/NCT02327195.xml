	<brief_title>General Anesthesia Emergence Induced Methylphenidate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based significant arousal stimulatory effect , investigator hypothesize methylphenidate ( inhibitor dopamine norepinephrine transporter ) decrease emergence time isoflurane general anesthesia . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To assess whether methylphenidate affect time emergence isoflurane general anesthesia . Time emergence define time termination isoflurane extubation . After stop isoflurane infusion , patient breath spontaneously adequate tidal volume respiratory rate , trachea extubated time record . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To assess efficacy methylphenidate prevent post operative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) limit opioids consumption : PONV verbal response scale 0 10 verbally elicit scale : 0 ( nausea ) 10 ( nausea bad could ) - To assess efficacy methylphenidate prevent opioids dose escalation ( fast cognitive improvement efficient pain control -Postoperative Pain Numeric Rating Scale : O=None ; ( 1-3 ) =Mild ; ( 4-6 ) = Moderate ; ( 7-10 ) =Severe ) . Study Population : Adult patient Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center - Sports Medicine , age 18-65 year , American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status I ( normal healthy patient ) II ( patient mild systemic disease ; functional limitation ) schedule undergo hip arthroscopic surgery - day discharge - isoflurane general anesthesia . Single-center , prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial involve 54 subject schedule undergo arthroscopic orthopedic surgery isoflurane general anesthesia The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center ( OSUWMC ) - University Hospital East . Eligible subject provide voluntary write informed consent include study .</detailed_description>
