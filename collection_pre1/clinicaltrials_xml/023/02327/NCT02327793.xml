	<detailed_description>Objective : To elucidate inter-relationships blood pressure ( BP ) , cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) oxygen metabolism acute ischemic stroke order establish rational acute hypertension treatment threshold . Background : Management acute hypertension first 48 hour stroke controversial lends compete rationale . Early reduction BP may improve outcome reduce rate hemorrhagic transformation edema formation early infarct . Conversely , early BP reduction might reduce CBF extend infarct . Natural history study demonstrate patient higher BP presentation elevate early mortality rate , causality establish . Consensus-based guideline acute BP management base physiological data sound evidence . The investigator propose start address clinical dilemma non-randomized control study serial measurement CBF oxygen metabolism acute stroke patient 3 different level acute blood pressure represent 3 different potential treatment threshold . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize volume severity oligemia risk tissue increase BP reduction acute stroke patient . Specific Aims : 1 . Determine effect mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) decrease CBF . 2 . Determine relationship infarct volume change time MAP . 3 . Determine frequency hemorrhagic transformation relationship MAP . Study Design : A 3 group non-randomized control study . After informed consent , patient undergo MRI scan include diffusion perfusion-weighted imaging ( DWI PWI ) . Patients MAP &lt; 100 mmHg receive hypertension treatment . Patients moderate hypertension ( MAP 100-120 mmHg ) treat transdermal nitroglycerin ( 0.2 mg/h ) 48 hour . Patients severe hypertension ( MAP &gt; 120 mmHg ) also treat intravenous labetalol , target &lt; 120 mmHg . Two hour baseline scan , MRI repeat . Any clinical radiographic evidence exacerbate oligemia associate BP reduction result immediate discontinuation anti-hypertensive therapy . The effectiveness BP control evaluate use weighted mean average MAP 72 hour . All patient re-imaged MRI day 3 ass hemorrhagic transformation . The primary endpoint change objectively measure hypoperfused tissue volume baseline 2 hour scan . Hypoperfused tissue determine volume voxels CBF ≤18 ml/100g/min , previously validate measurement independent observer variability . Sample size base power calculation require detect 10 % change oligemic tissue volume ( would sufficient result exacerbation ischemic injury ) follow MAP reduction . Preliminary Work : First , investigator survey Canadian stroke neurologist current BP management practice . Indications acute BP therapy acute stroke vary 180 240 mmHg systolic , clinician even consider diastolic MAP treatment threshold . Physicians base generally conservative approach absence evidence . Second , investigator assess feasibility serial MRI MAP treatment protocol . To date , 9 patient imaged repeat MRI , within 2 hour initial exam , confirm CBF≤18 ml/100g/min measure risk tissue volume use monitor cerebral perfusion . Four patient treat BP management protocol image serially . MAP decrease 4 patient 2 hour treatment . Increases hypoperfused tissue volume ( CBF≤18 ml/100g/min ) follow MAP reduction generally mild ( &lt; 10 % ) . Of note , BP reduction , patient low initial MAP ( 96 mmHg ) mark decline CBF large increase volume risk tissue . Third , investigator determine decrease CBF always associate increase oxygen extraction , appear protect tissue infarct expansion DWI lesion volume remain stable . The variation current practice demonstration reduction MAP lead decrease CBF , potentially increase risk adverse stroke-related outcome justifies study determine appropriate treatment threshold . Significance : The precise relationship CBF MAP acute stroke must elucidate prior develop treatment threshold test large randomize controlled trial . A serial perfusion study , careful monitoring MAP critical step develop rational BP management protocol . These finding also help elucidate mechanism poor outcome patient high low MAP onset .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Acute ischemic stroke within 72 hour symptom onset . In case onset time establish , consider time patient last know well . 18 year old . Patients Partial Anterior Circulation Infarcts ( PACI ; Oxfordshire Stroke Classification Project ; OSCP ) include . Patients Posterior Circulation Infarcts ( POCI ) include evidence cortical infarction territory posterior cerebral artery branch , include occipital mesial temporal lobe . Patients contraindication BP lower protocol ( i.e . know extracranial/intracranial arterial stenosis , highgrade stenotic valvular heart disease , severe renal failure ) ineligible , definite indication BP reduction ( i.e . hypertensive encephalopathy , aortic dissection ) . Patients contraindication MRI exclude , include metallic implant past sensitivity gadolinium contrast medium . Due recent report nephrogenic systemic fibrosis associate gadolinium exposure individual preexist renal failure , patient Creatinine &gt; 160 μmol/l Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR ) &lt; 60 ml/min also exclude . Patients renal artery stenosis exclude study , irrespective renal function . Due possibility oxygen therapy may confound CBF measurement , patient require &gt; 4 lpm keep Sp02 ≥92 % nasal cannulae exclude . Patients suspect hemodynamic stroke mechanism ineligible . This include patient know suspected hypotensive period and/or watershed territory cerebral infarction see CT MRI . Due possibility increase susceptibility BP reduction patient raise intracerebral pressure ( ICP ) , evidence significant mass effect secondary acute infarction , include degree midline shift and/or ventricular compression ineligible . For reason , patient head eye deviation clinical evidence Total Anterior Circulation Infarct ( TACI ; OSCP ) also ineligible . Due technical difficulty associate PWI posterior fossa , patient brainstem cerebellar stroke exclude . Patients know sensitivity nitroglycerin/labetalol/adhesives nitroglycerin patches/ACE inhibitors/Angiotensin Receptor Blockers exclude . Amplification vasodilatory effect topical nitroglycerin phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil tadalafil result severe hypotension . Patients use either drug within 12 h initial assessment therefore exclude .</criteria>
