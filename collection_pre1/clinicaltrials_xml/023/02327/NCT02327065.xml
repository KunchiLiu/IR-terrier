	<brief_title>Prospective Multi-center , Single Blinded , Randomized , Controlled Trial EUS-FNB EUS-FNA Solid Occupying Lesion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study subject divide two group : EUS-FNA ( 22G EchoTip Ultra needle ) Group EUS-FNB group ( 22G EchoTip ProCore needle ) .Take malignant occupy lesion diagnosis accuracy research major indicator compare EUS-FNB group EUS-FNA group optimal efficiency test . Take class I error a=0.05 , class II error β=0.15 , power=0.85 . Suppose malignancy diagnosis accuracy 80 % , FNB 93 % . The two trial group randomly allocate 1:1 , suppose malignancy case take 70 % whole case , consider shed factor , extra 20 % case include . So estimated case number 204 case EUS-FNB group 204 case EUS-FNA group , totally 408 case trial . Done professional statistical people randomize block group method SAS 9.2 statistical software generate randomize serial number（001—408）for two group 1:1 manner . The serial number randomize group number trial patient , block capacity 8 , totally 51 randomized block . The randomized grouping generate duplicate copy seal . One copy send trial center patient allocating , another copy save trial applicant unit . Every trail center responsible screen qualified patient , rank visit time get randomize group number determine go EUS-FNA EUS-FNB.The research people patient trial center know randomize grouping number relevant group . The group name seal scratch card . Every trial patient get unique randomize number , change whole trial . Use inclusion exclusion criterion observe patient relative inspection , confirm patient qualified trial . Record result last time test treatment . Although good get inform consent kind observation test , reason , medical imaging examination complete , long image examination do within 3 week needle biopsy , still collect baseline data ( image examination do hospital , trial center issue new evaluation report 1 week patient join trial group ) ; lab test item do 2 week needle biopsy still collect baseline data pre-research use , test do trail center hospital guarantee data trace ability . The investigator needle pass 4 time : 1-2 needle pass Slow-Pull 3-4 needle pass Vacuum suction.If core tissue obtain operator/onsite pathologist determine insufficient specimen operation , remedy procedure do , operator use proper puncture method continue remedy biopsy.After first round needle biopsy , trial patient diagnose , get agreement patient , patient cross-over another trial group needle biopsy lesion 1 week later method mention above.Without know needle biopsy type , cytologist pathologist evaluate specimen quality make diagnosis . Every specimen independently evaluate diagnosed 2 expert . If 2 expert different judgment , two expert discuss together make final diagnose discussion . If sample 2 cytology smear slide , take high score slide result.Follow ( outpatient follow telephone follow ) patient 1 week , 12 week 36 week needle biopsy collect patient clinical data confirm final diagnosis . During trial , severe adverse event occurs , trialed center must take immediate action necessary guarantee trialed patient ' safety . Once severe adverse event occurs , researcher inform trial applicant trail center 's ethic committee within 24 hour researcher get know adverse event . And researcher also fax report State Food Drug Administration China local provincial food drug administration . After receive report , applicant inform clinical trial center within 24 hour . All severe adverse event file group leader medical center trial center . CRF ( Case Report Form ) fill researcher , every involved patient must CRF ( Case Report Form ) fill . This audited clinical monitor hand data administrator input manage data , first copy keep applicant , second copy go trial center , third copy keep trail researchers.The data input management take care specially assign person . In order guarantee data accuracy , data input do twice two independent data administrator , computerize manual verifying , hand data statistical expert blind check statistic analyzing.For question doubt within case report form , data administrator make DRQ via clinical monitor ask researcher . The researcher answer fee back soon possible . According researcher answer , data administrator data modifying , confirm inputting , necessary send DRQ again.After blind audition confirm establish data base correct , major researcher , applicant statistic analyze people lock data . The locked data change , data base hand statistical analyzer statistic analyze accord statistic analyzing plan . Problems find data lock modify statistic analyze procedure.This do specialize statistic analyze people accord predetermine statistic analyzing plan . The statistic analyze carry accord intention principle confirm full analysis set per-protocol set principle . After complete statistic analyzing , statistic analyzer issue statistic analysis report send major researcher write study report . Statistic analyzing plan : ⑴ General principle : ① statistic test use two-tailed-test method , P &lt; 0.05 think test difference statistical significance . ② quantitative indicator description calculate Mean Standard deviation . The classification indicator description describe case percentage type case . ⑵ Statistic analyze method : ① measurement data , compare baseline value selection period , use pair t-test symbol rank sum test compare before-after-difference within group.② count data , use x2 test compare group . ⑶ Shedding analysis : Comparison groups'total shed rate shed rate cause adverse event use x2 test Fisher 's exact test method . ⑷ The baseline value 's equilibrium analysis : Use group test x2 test compare demography info vital sign , disease history , basic treatment indicator baseline value , measure balance group . The baseline evaluation do FAS（full analysis set ) PPs ( per-protocol set ) . ⑸ Effectiveness analysis : The major indicator effectiveness analysis diagnostic accuracy malignant disease , indicator second effectiveness include percentage Grade A specimen complication rate etc . two group rate Youden index comparison use approximate normal Z test use central effect x2 test . ( 6 ) Safety analysis : Use x2 test Fisher 's exact test compare adverse event/adverse reaction ( include biopsy complication ) rate group . And use table describe adverse event trial project ; lab test result trial , normal/abnormal change condition relationship trial research abnormal change happen .</detailed_description>
