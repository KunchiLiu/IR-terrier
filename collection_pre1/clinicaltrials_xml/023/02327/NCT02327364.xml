	<detailed_description>All patient confirm Pearson Syndrome satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion offer enrollment study . Patients follow participate NAMDC clinical site enrol site . Patients follow participate NAMDC clinical site wish participate may contact one member sit directly local doctor may direct one member site . Both male female patient racial ethnic background satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion encourage participate . Children adult eligible enrol , expect patient population mostly child . Each patient Pearson Syndrome enroll NAMDC Clinical Registry encourage participate study . Each patient enrol study require enroll NAMDC Clinical Registry either prior upon enrol study . Demographic , medical history , biochemical , histological , genetic , clinical data registry incorporate study . Every effort make minimize inconvenience patient participate study . The studyâ€”related activity patient visit keep maximum one hour , , whenever possible , schedule coincide patient 's regular follow-up treating physician .
