	<brief_summary>This project pilot test intervention increase participation rate cardiac rehabilitation medication adherence among patient follow cardiovascular event . The intervention use educational video show referral cardiac rehabilitation ( hospital discharge ) , along brief , telephone-delivered counseling session increase motivation participate cardiac rehabilitation take cardiac medication prescribe ( follow hospital discharge ) . One hundred twenty patient experience cardiovascular event , eligible cardiac rehabilitation , recruit participate study . Three group participant ( 40 ) form : control group receive standard care , first experimental group see educational video receive motivational counsel attend cardiac rehabilitation , second experimental group receive motivational counseling adhere medication prescribe . It expect experimental group participant differ control group participant rate participation cardiac rehabilitation ( experimental group # 1 ) medication adherence ( experimental group # 2 ) . If successful , intervention could use hospital setting increase patient ' adherence behavior .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study test feasibility pilot intervention increase adherence behavior among patient eligible cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) . The intervention include two component . The first component educational video show pre-discharge , time referral CR make . The video , base social-cognitive principle , educate patient expect CR use actual CR patient . The second component intervention brief , telephone-delivered counseling session increase motivation adhere prescribe CR participation cardiac medication . The counseling session use well-established motivational interviewing technique . Three group form , 40 participant : control group receive standard care , experimental group # 1 receives educational video plus counsel session focus participate CR , experimental group # 2 receives counsel session focus take cardiac medication prescribe . Given pilot study sample size relatively small , statistically significant difference expect . However , follow hypothesis explore : - Experimental group # 1 differ control group rate participation CR . - Experimental group # 2 differ control group experimental group # 1 adherence prescribe medication . Participants recruit patient Truman Medical Center ( TMC ) eligible CR . Information receive daily new patient TMC eligible CR need refer . Investigators provide research team member information eligible patient approach study participation . A member research team visit patient TMC hospital room pre-discharge ask interested learning study . If indicate interest learning , brief summary study provide ( e.g. , `` The investigator interested learn health care provider best talk patient treatment recommendations. '' ) . Then , team member administer brief cognitive assessment determine whether patient able complete study determine inclusion criterion meet . If decline participation , correctly answer first two screen question , patient ask answer five brief demographic question thank time . These five demographic question ask investigator may compare final sample patient decline participation explore difference could limit generalizability finding . If patient correctly answer two screen question , continue interested learning study , research team member provide patient consent form TMC 's PHI authorization form . Upon completion consent form , patient also ask review pharmacy release form complete sign consent share prescription refill data investigator . Afterward , Time 1 ( baseline ) questionnaire administer via interview research team member . The interview take approximately 15 minute complete . Upon completion , research team member provide participant appointment reminder card $ 10 cash voucher use TMC Cash Office . At time , team member schedule next two interview complete telephone ( i.e. , Times 2 3 ) . Upon completion Time 1 questionnaire , team member complete form participant 's basic information provide CR nurse . In turn , CR nurse assign participant one three study group . Before recruitment begin , statistician create random number table group assignment stratify race heart failure diagnosis . The random number table use create seal envelope randomization information study participant . The envelope sequentially number provided CR nurse recruitment . Upon receive form team member , open next seal envelope reveal group participant assign . She note envelope number group assignment form . Then , form provide research team secure storage . Participants randomly assign one three group : A control group receive standard care . Standard care include visit CR nurse pre-discharge refer patient CR . This referral session include discussion heart health , CR benefit outcomes , literature prescribe medication . If possible , CR orientation appointment schedule patient . If possible schedule orientation session referral , CR staff member call patient day discharge schedule appointment . Reminder call make CR staff member day schedule appointment . The pharmacist also visit patient CR referral make review prescribed medication . Follow-up phone call make 2-3 day discharge pharmacy team answer medication question trouble-shoot problem . Experimental group # 1 : This group receive standard care ( detail ) , show educational video iPad CR nurse referral . The educational video base social-cognitive principle , goal educate prospective CR patient happen CR . The video approximately nine minute long , feature testimonial real CR patient . In addition , group call trained counselor approximately one week discharge . During call , counselor conduct brief counsel session , use motivational interviewing ( MI ) technique , focus increase motivation participate CR . During session , counselor help participant identify barrier benefit participate CR , thereby increase internal motivation participate . The counseling session take approximately 10 minute . Experimental group # 2 : This group receive standard care ( detail ) , plus counsel session focus medical adherence . Specifically , counselor conduct session improve internal motivation adhere cardiac medication prescribe pharmacist . The session take approximately 10 minute . As state , CR nurse note participant 's randomization information sheet , information share research team member participant discharged hospital . This information share team member prior Time 2 phone call ( group membership need determined call make plan , , counsel session complete ) . All participant take part Time 1 interview ( see ) , well telephone interview Time 2 ( approximately one week post-discharge ; immediately prior counsel session provide experimental group ) Time 3 ( approximately five week post-discharge ) . The Time 2 interview take approximately 20 minute Time 3 interview take approximately 30 minute . Therefore , control group take part 15-minute Time 1 in-person interview , 20-minute Time 2 telephone interview , 30-minute Time 3 telephone interview . Experimental group # 1 take part 15-minute Time 1 in-person interview , 20-minute Time 2 telephone interview , 10 minute counsel session immediately follow Time 2 interview , 30-minute Time 3 telephone interview . Experimental group # 3 take part 15-minute Time 1 in-person interview , 20-minute Time 2 telephone interview , 10-minute counseling session immediately follow Time 2 interview , 30-minute Time 3 telephone interview . The Time 1 ( baseline ) interview measure follow constructs/contains follow scale : - Demographic question - Confidence motivation change behavior - Knowledge cardiac rehabilitation - Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) - Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) - Subjective health status ( adapt BRFSS ) - Cardiac self-blame The Time 2 ( 1-week post-discharge ) interview measure follow constructs/contains follow scale : - Confidence motivation change behavior - Medication Adherence Self-Efficacy - Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire - Knowledge cardiac rehabilitation - Knowledge cardioprotective medication - Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) - Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) - Subjective health status ( adapt BRFSS ) - Medical Care Questionnaire - Medication Adherence - Feedback educational video ( control/experimental group # 2 ) The Time 3 ( 5-weeks post-discharge ) interview measure follow constructs/contains follow scale : - Confidence motivation change behavior - Medication Adherence Self-Efficacy - Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire - Knowledge cardiac rehabilitation - Knowledge cardioprotective medication - Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) - Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) - Subjective health status ( adapt BRFSS ) - Medical Care Questionnaire - Medication Adherence - Ratings counsel session ( control group )</detailed_description>
