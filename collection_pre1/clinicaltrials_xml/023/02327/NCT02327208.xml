	<brief_summary>The objective study : 1 ) determine effect prototype recovery food product provide supplemental energy whole-body protein balance , skeletal muscle mass , biomarkers physiological status strain winter military training , 2 ) determine extent vary macronutrient composition ( protein-based [ PRO ] versus carbohydrate-based [ CHO ] ) food product modulate physiological consequence strenuous military training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Up 120 Norwegian Soldiers 2nd Battalion , Brigade North , Norwegian Army station Skjold Garrison enrol 9-day , randomize control study . Using dietary analysis , body composition assessment , stable isotope methodology , basic biochemical technique , measure physiological strain , effect supplemental energy form carbohydrate protein index muscle mass physiological status assess . We hypothesize consume supplemental energy attenuate effect severe energy deficit inflammation , androgenic hormone , whole-body protein retention , thereby protect skeletal muscle mass . We expect consume PRO promote favorable recovery consume CHO , indicate measure increase whole-body protein synthesis great conservation skeletal muscle mass .</detailed_description>
