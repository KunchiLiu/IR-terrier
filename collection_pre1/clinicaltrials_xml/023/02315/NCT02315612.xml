	<brief_title>Anti-CD22 Chimeric Receptor T Cells Pediatric Young Adults With Recurrent Refractory CD22-expressing B Cell Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Adoptive cellular therapy T cell genetically modify use viral-basedvectors express chimeric antigen receptor target CD19 molecule demonstrate dramatic clinical response patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . However , patient respond CD19-negative escape observe follow CD19 CAR therapy , well anti-CD19/CD3 bispecific antibody therapy . Thus , additional target need . - CD22 B-lineage-restricted , transmembrane phosphoglycoprotein Ig superfamily widely express B-cell malignancy include 96 % 100 % pediatric Bprecursor ALL . Therefore , CD22 represent promising target . Encouraging response target CD22 antibody base immunoconjugate see patient , include child , recurrent refractory ALL . This first human test anti-CD22 CAR adoptive cell therapy . Objectives : - To determine feasibility produce anti-CD22 CAR cell meeting establish release criterion . - To assess safety administer escalate dos anti-CD22-CAR engineer T cell child young adult recurrent refractory CD22- expressing B cell malignancy follow cyclophosphamide/fludarabine preparative regimen . Eligibility : - Patients 1-30 year age , least 15 kg , CD22-expressing B-cell malignancy recur respond one standard regimens deem incurable standard therapy . Patients history allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation ( SCT ) meet eligibility criterion eligible participate . Patients previously treat anti-CD19 CAR engineer T cell also eligible . Design : - PBMC obtain leukapheresis , CD3+ cell enrich cultured presence anti-CD3/-CD28 bead follow lentiviral vector supernatant contain anti-CD22 ( M971BBz ) CAR . - On Day -4 ( cell infusion Day 0 ) , patient begin induction chemotherapy comprise fludarabine 25 mg/m2 Days -4 , -3 -2 cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2 day 2 . - The CD22-CAR cell infuse Day 0 , 72h delay allow infusion fresh cell 7 day delay cell cryopreserved , need resolution clinical toxicity , generate adequate cell number , facilitate scheduling . - A phase I cell dose escalation scheme perform use 4 dose level ( 3 x 105 transduce T cells/kg ; 1 x 106 transduce T cells/kg ; 3 x 106 transduce T cells/kg ; 1 x 107 transduce T cells/kg ( 20 % ) ) . If 2/6 patient DLT dose level 1 , safety evaluate de-escalated dose 1 x 105 transduced T cells/kg ( 20 % ) ) . Once maximum tolerate dose ( high level evaluate ) reach , enrollment expansion cohort total 17 patient MTD two stratum proceed provide additional information regard feasibility , safety efficacy treatment . Patients previously receive CD19 CAR T cell evaluate separate stratum CARna ( SqrRoot ) patient response may different two group . - Patients monitored toxicity , response T cell persistence well biologic correlate .</detailed_description>
