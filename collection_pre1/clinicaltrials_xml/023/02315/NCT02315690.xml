	<detailed_description>Title Evaluating effectiveness feasibility reactive focal mass drug administration ( fMDA ) vs. reactive case detection ( RACD ) community level intervention response passively identify index malaria case Swaziland Study design Cluster randomise control trial Aims Primary aim : To compare impact fMDA versus RACD malaria incidence . Secondary aim Effectiveness : 1 . To compare impact fMDA versus RACD seroprevalence . 2 . To compare impact fMDA versus RACD prevalence infection . Feasibility : 1 . To evaluate safety fMDA . 2 . To measure adherence DHAp use modify DOT regimen . 3 . To determine feasibility reach 80 % coverage fMDA . 4 . To compare acceptability fMDA . 5 . To compare cost cost-effectiveness fMDA versus RACD . Study site Eastern endemic region Swaziland , low endemic malaria elimination set . A total 287 health facility catchment area locate area . Time frame September 2015 - August 2017 Cluster unit randomisation At-risk localities randomize either fMDA RACD use block stratify randomization base risk rank population Target area Individuals reside within 200 ( fMDA arm ) 500 ( RACD arm ) index case detect passive surveillance , individual reside immediately beyond 200 fMDA arm include minimum 30 individual enrol within 200 m. Intervention All individual reside study locality receive vector control preventative measure per program . In fMDA arm , individual target area receive dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHAp ) daily 3 day first dose take later 5 week index case presentation ( goal within one week ) . Individuals RACD target area test RDT take near health facility treatment per program operating procedure . Evaluation methods The primary outcome measure incidence obtain routine surveillance data . Secondary outcome effectiveness measure study conclusion collect dried blood spot ( DBS ) resident target area arm . Prevalence infection measure loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP ) seroprevalence measure quantify marker recent malaria exposure . Secondary outcome feasibility measure follow : 1 . Safety : number serious adverse event deem possibly , probably , definitely related DHAp . 2 . Adherence : proportion individual complete three day therapy among individual initiate DHAp fMDA arm , assess pill count . 3 . Coverage : proportion individual reside within 200m ( fMDA locality ) 500m ( RACD locality ) index case consent participate complete initial procedure study arm ( initial dose DHAp fMDA arm finger prick RDT RACD arm ) . 4 . Acceptability : proportion eligible individual refuse take part study qualitative assessment subset individual fMDA arm . 5 . Cost : cost per index case-level intervention cost per case avert . Sample size The sample size base number study locality experience least one incident case malaria previous season . Within 77 randomized locality , expect 63 locality incident case malaria receive intervention . For primary objective , hypothesize mFDA effective RACD . At current sample size , study power detect difference cumulative incidence incidence fMDA arm reduce 50 % compare RACD arm . Incidence measure locality level among at-risk population , individual enumeration area ( EA ) least one case identify ( expect approximately 55,928 individual among total study population 211,189 , harmonic mean 656 per locality ( 41,328 effective population ) ) . Secondary outcome seroprevalence prevalence measure individual reside target area ( total N=5,400 ) harmonic mean 60 person receive intervention per locality ( 3,780 effective population ) . Primary outcome Incidence malaria case Secondary outcomes 1 . Seroprevalence ELISA 2 . Prevalence infection 3 . Coverage intervention : proportion target population receive finger prick RACD arm receive initial dose DHAp TPE arm ( intention treat analysis ) . 4 . Adherence DHAp TPE arm . 5 . Safety DHAp 6 . Acceptance 7 . Cost per intervention episode , per case avert</detailed_description>
