	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Combination With GA101 ( Obinutuzumab ) Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label phase IB/II clinical trial design determine safety clinical activity Ibrutinib combination GA101 - Obinutuzumab . Safety , tolerability dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) evaluate initial cycle treatment ( Cycle 1 ; Day 1-28 ) part phase Ib study ( safety run-in ) . In phase II response rate determine subject receive treatment . The study enroll 32 subject previously untreated active disease require treatment ( define IWCLL 2008 criterion initiation therapy ) . The study include Screening Phase , Treatment Phase , Follow-up Phase . The Screening Phase assessment perform within 28 day prior treatment . The Treatment Phase extend first dose completion plan cycle treatment ( # 6 ) study drug discontinuation . All subject receive Ibrutinib 420 mg ( 3 x 140-mg capsule ) orally daily 6 cycle . The treatment Ibrutinib continue cycle 6 follow 3 year disease progression , unacceptable toxicity reason treatment discontinuation . Subjects undergo response assessment two month completion study treatment . The initial follow-up evaluation make ( response assessment ) every 3 month 9 month later every 6 month initiation new treatment CLL , consent withdrawal death . During long-term follow-up phase , subject follow survival ( PFS , TFS OS ) . The long-term follow-up phase continue disease progression , death , loss follow , consent withdrawal , study end , whichever occur first . An evaluation End Study perform due initiation new treatment CLL withdrawal consent .</detailed_description>
