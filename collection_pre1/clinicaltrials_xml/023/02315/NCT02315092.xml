	<brief_summary>The current trial aim compare assessment diabetic foot ulcer fluorescence image guidance standard practice . The device use acquire fluorescence image diabetic foot ulcer : wound illuminated violet/blue light , pathogenic bacterial specie emit unique red fluorescence signal . The device intend used part clinical assessment process , may include visual assessment , sign heat high temperature , presence exudate , redness area . Images guide clinician inspect , sample evaluate area fluoresce bacteria present . This study allow u determine benefit fluorescence image-guided procedure compare standard clinical practice ass bacterial burden diabetic foot ulcer . Microbiological swab standard practice fluoresce-guided imaging perform order compare two technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Fluorescence-image Guided Wound Assessment vs. Standard Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic wound associate care burden patient health care system worldwide . Microbiological test wound sample often use identify quantify bacterial specie , latter may objective quantitative indicator infection predictive correlate healing . Microbiology report contain useful information microbial identity , antibiotic susceptibility , semi-quantitative bacterial growth rate , data typically represent bacterial load wound centre , often arrive 3-5 day later . There unmet clinical need improve microbiological sampling treatment wound infection . To address need , develop handheld portable imaging device obtain white light ( WL ) fluorescence ( FL ) image ( video ) normal skin wound high-resolution real-time , use point-of-care . It demonstrate previous study device1 ) provide image-guidance tissue sampling , detect clinically-significant level pathogenic bacteria wound infection otherwise overlook conventional sample 2 ) provide image-guidance wound treatment , accelerate wound closure compare conventional therapy quantitatively track long-term change bacterial bioburden distribution wound . The current trial aim compare assessment diabetic foot ulcer fluorescence image guidance standard practice . The device use acquire fluorescence image diabetic foot ulcer : wound illuminated violet/blue light , pathogenic bacterial specie emit unique red fluorescence signal . The device intend used part clinical assessment process , may include visual assessment , sign heat high temperature , presence exudate , redness area .

This study allow u determine benefit fluorescence image-guided procedure compare standard clinical practice ass bacterial burden diabetic foot ulcer .
