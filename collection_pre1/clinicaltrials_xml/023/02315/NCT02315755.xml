	<brief_title>Observational Study Evaluating The Efficacy And Effects On Quality Of Life Of Targeted Treatments Following TKIs In mRCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) common malignant tumour kidney . Targeted therapy , recently introduce treatment mRCC , become standard treatment patient [ 1 ] . With improved survival rate tolerable side effect profile , Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors ( TKIs ) largely replaced conventional immunotherapy worldwide . [ 2-3 ] In Turkey , due reimbursement condition define authority , cytokine ( interferon alpha ) treatment standard treatment first-line therapy [ 4 ] . Rationale : TKI therapy use interferon alpha Turkey due current reimbursement status . Therefore , data quality life ( QoL ) pivotal study standard TKI treatment reflect QoL status patient treat TKIs second third line treatment Turkey . In study , clinical outcome impact quality life target treatment follow TKIs explore . To knowledge , since similar reimbursement condition world place IFN first line standard treatment , first study evaluate QoL status target therapy use 3rd line treatment mRCC patient . Research Question Objectives Research Question : There data available literature explain effect target therapy use 3rd line treatment follow IFN TKIs metastatic renal cell carcinoma patient . Therefore , essential understand health-related quality life efficacy target therapy use 3rd line treatment due current reimbursement condition Turkey . Primary Objective : - Measurement health-related quality life target therapy use 3rd line treatment - Overall response rate end follow - Median progression free survival accord RECIST version 1.1 Secondary Objectives : - Overall survival rate - Effect quality life prognosis . - Adverse event 3rd line target treatment accord CTCAE.4.03 - Dose modification due adverse event - Correlation efficacy ( overall response rate month 12 median PFS ) dose modification due adverse event - Correlation efficacy ( overall response rate month 12 median PFS ) blood pressure Study Design : This multi-center , national , non-interventional/observational study . It define accord NUTS ( Nomenclature Territorial Units Statistics : Nomenclature d'unites Territoriales Statistiques , French ) criterion , regional classification , create order reduce interregional disparity socio-economic analysis region , produce data comparable European Union ( EU ) . Turkey divide 12 NUTS region depend economic , social , cultural , geographical aspect , population size . In study , patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma center 12 NUTS region Turkey include , meet inclusion criterion . In study , approximately 152 patient plan recruited 12 month followed-up 12 month . Additionally , every patient followed-up survival follow-up order ass overall survival site close visit . Survival follow-up perform via telephone visit site visit exist . Study Population : Metastatic renal cell carcinoma patient 3rd line target therapy follow 1st line interferon alpha 2nd line TKI . All patient â‰¥ 18 year old sign informed consent document . Variables : Age , gender , height , weight , vital sign blood pressure Socio-demographic characteristic ECOG performance status Concomitant diseases medication Medical history Histopathological finding Type surgical procedure Treatment history current treatment information Metastatic feature MSKCC risk factor Laboratory find The quality life questionnaire ( FKSI-15 , EQ5D-3L , FKSI-DRS ) visit . Blood pressure diary Other treatment follow-up , , dose duration Side effect ( treatment side effect , interruption treatment , dose reduction , dose-elevation ) PFS , OS ORR evaluation 3rd , 6th , 9th 12th month perform accord RECIST version 1.1 , additionally , every patient followed-up survival follow-up order ass overall survival site close visit . Survival follow-up perform via telephone visit site visit exist . ORR : The best overall response best response record start study treatment end treatment take account requirement confirmation . The patient 's best overall response assignment depend finding target non-target disease also take consideration appearance new lesion . Furthermore , depend nature study protocol requirement , may also require confirmatory measurement . PFS : The length time treatment disease , patient live disease get bad . In clinical trial , measure progression-free survival one way see well new treatment work . OS : 1 year Overall Survival ( OS ) , define time start 3rd line treatment death 1 year due cause ( measured end follow-up ) . Data Sources : The source data electronic write patient record participate center . The patient 's data access patient file . In center , system use conjunction . The data access use system . Sample Size : This multi-center , national , non-interventional/observational study . In study , patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma meet inclusion criterion include center 12 NUTS region Turkey . Since non-interventional observational study , specific follow-up protocol . In study , approximately 152 patient evaluate . According Turkish Statistical Institute data end 2013 population Turkey approximately 80 million [ 5 ] . In project Turkey Association Cancer Research Control name Cancer Record Incidence show cancer incidence 100-150 100.000 [ 6 ] 2 % new cancer renal cell carcinoma [ 7 ] . There would 1800 new RCC patient 1 year , accord OS disease , would 4000 RCC patient Turkey . 15 % metastatic time diagnosis 30-40 % metastatic period time [ 8 ] . Presuming 1800 patient metastatic renal carcinoma Turkey , minimum sample size 7,6 confidence interval , 95 % confidence level 80 % power calculate 152 . Data Analysis : Statistical analysis primarily explorative descriptive nature . Patients receive least one dose 3rd line therapy sufficient information whether adverse event valid safety analysis . Patients receive least one dose 3rd line therapy information regard efficacy therapy valid intent-to-treat efficacy analysis . Demographic data , baseline characteristic , diagnosis prior treatment RCC , concomitant disease , concomitant medication describe summary statistic mean , SD , minimum , 1 , 5 , 25 , 75 , 95 , 99 percent quartile , median , maximum continuous variable , category count frequency ( percentage ) categorical variable . Concomitant diseases case report form correspond MedDRA term . Concomitant medication cod use WHO 's drug dictionary . Descriptive summary Kaplan-Meier ( KM ) estimate ( include number fail , number censor , 25th 75th percentile respective 95 % confidence level median 95 % Confidence level ) KM curve present time-to-event efficacy variable ( PFS , TTP , time treatment failure ) . Mean , SD , minimum , 1 , 5 , 25 , 75 , 95 , 99 percent quartile , median , maximum produced duration treatment . Category count frequency ( percentage ) calculate tumor status different visit general subjective rating efficacy 3rd line therapy treat physician . Adverse event summarize use CTCAE.4.03 cod system . Event rate single adverse event calculate base total number patient valid safety . Adverse event categorize accord relation , seriousness , CTCAE grade ( version 4.03 ) , discontinuation therapy , action take outcome . Special attention pay serious adverse event unexpected unlisted ADRs . Category count frequency ( percentage ) calculate overall tolerability . Since enrollment initiation treatment , information collect analyzed retrospectively . The best overall response best response record start study treatment end treatment take account requirement confirmation .</detailed_description>
