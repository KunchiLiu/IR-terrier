	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) complicate 25 % cardiac surgical procedure increase mortality fourfold . The incidence AKI increasing , pathogenesis poorly understood , current diagnostic test lack specificity sensitivity , effective treatment . Improving outcomes patient risk AKI recently define NHS priority . The primary aim study determine plasma derive microvesicles ( MV ) specifically MV associate microRNAs ( miRNA ) regulate survival signal post cardiac surgery AKI . The study involve clinical experimental research project combine laboratory analysis circulate MV miRNA clinical study . The study specifically consider MV miRNA alter inflammatory signal kidney cardiac surgery , modify important clinical risk factor , whether may serve early biomarkers injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AKI characterise upregulation compete pro-survival pro- inflammatory/ apoptotic signaling pathway whereby process associate renal recovery ; tubular epithelial phenotypic change proliferation occur simultaneously associate diminished GFR , vascular inflammation , tubular dysfunction epithelial apoptosis . Protection AKI achieve alter balance pathway ; example upregulation pivotal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase - serine-threonine protein kinase B ( PI3K-Akt ) pro-survival pathway follow administration erythropoietin insulin like growth factor inhibit experimental AKI follow renal ischaemia reperfusion rodent swine . In work show post cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) AKI swine prevent administration either phosphodiesterase type 5 ( PDE-5 ) inhibitor promote cell survival endothelial homeostasis via augmentation endogenous nitric oxide ( NO ) signalling , inhibition endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) , important pro-inflammatory mediator promoter oxidative stress renal injury How compete pathway regulate patient risk AKI poorly understand however , belief identification process facilitate development new effective prevention treatment strategy AKI improve outcome patient</detailed_description>
