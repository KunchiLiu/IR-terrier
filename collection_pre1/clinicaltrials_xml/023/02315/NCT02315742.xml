	<detailed_description>By 2015 half person live HIV ( PLWH ) U.S. older 50 year age . Two factor contribute `` gray '' HIV epidemic . The overwhelming success antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) improve life expectancy dramatically change trajectory HIV ; complex chronic condition , often associate multiple comorbidities cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) cognitive impairment ( CI ) . Second , increase number middle-aged old adult become infected HIV . Clinicians , patient , society currently ill-prepared deal biomedical complexity unique medical psychosocial challenge associate grow age HIV population . Aerobic exercise exercise speed heart rate lower CVD risk , know improve physical mental function aging , well design study report use aerobic exercise intervention PLWH , study report whether exercise improve cognitive function high risk CI population . Regular aerobic exercise perform 5 time per week 150 minute also show improve aspect cognitive function community-dwelling older adult . Only one exercise study however , examine effect exercise cognition PLWH limit self-reported , unreliable indicator cognitive status ; study report whether exercise improve cognition population use objective assessment , examine potential mechanism involve . The home-based , 5 day per week moderate intensity walk intervention , 'Let 's Move Program , ' test effective lowering CVD risk old caregiver adult advance CVD . The propose pre-post test pilot study examine feasibility implement Lets Move Program among 40 PLWH 6-months . Participants enrol study ≥ 50 year age , sedentary , 2 CVD risk factor high blood pressure obesity demonstrate mild moderate CI use standardized test . Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) use promote exercise confidence optimize adherence intervention .</detailed_description>
