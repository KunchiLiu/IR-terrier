	<brief_title>Carfilzomib/Cyclophosphamide/Dexamethasone With Maintenance Carfilzomib Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Myeloma cancer bone marrow , patient young fit enough , disease usually treat chemotherapy ( sometimes call induction chemotherapy ) follow stem cell transplant use patient 's stem cell ( autograft Autologous Stem Cell Transplant ) . Unfortunately almost patient experience relapse point follow treatment . After relapse number treatment option eventually disease become resistant therapy . The use Autologous Stem Cell Transplant ( Transplant ) initial chemotherapy treatment show study increase amount time patient without symptom myeloma unfortunately disease relapse . However , recently effective induction chemotherapy regimen develop patient treat new regimen able achieve high deeper responses previously treat old regimen . Many also achieve complete good partial response , rare traditional chemotherapy regimen . So , investigator know give patient Autologous Stem Cell Transplant straight initial induction chemotherapy best thing . It may patient respond well new drug contain regimen obtain benefit stem cell stem cell frozen store , use disease relapse . In Cardamon trial , investigator directly compare outcome patient receive transplant , versus patient instead receive Consolidation therapy . After induction treatment stem cell harvest , patient randomly allocate receive either transplant receive consolidation therapy . Patients Cardamon trial also give maintenance treatment . This treatment give ongoing basis , transplant Consolidation therapy . The aim maintenance treatment prolong disease response delay time relapse . In summary purpose Cardamon study : 1. confirm high response rate new treatment regime include Carfilzomib plus 2 standard chemotherapy drug use treatment Multiple Myeloma , 2. investigate whether patient respond well new Carfilzomib-containing induction regimen able maintain long remission period without Autologous Stem Cell Transplant 'up-front ' , 3. find maintenance treatment Carfilzomib able reduce number remain myeloma cell bone marrow , use Minimal Residual Disease test .</detailed_description>
