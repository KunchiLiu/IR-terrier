	<brief_summary>With goal provide improved treatment patient overactive bladder symptom ( OAB ) , investigator seek apply new technology time-resolved ( cine ) MRI combine urodynamics ( UDS ) understand exact effect intravesical botulinum toxin bladder physiology . The investigator specifically aim assess physiological mechanism intravesical botulinum alleviates urgency urge incontinence symptom woman OAB refractory medical therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder ( OAB ) define International Continence Society urinary frequency urgency , without urge urinary incontinence . The burden OAB American public immense human financial term . Despite burden , lack effective diagnostic treatment modality OAB . Other two-dimensional video urodynamics , remain relatively unchanged decade , lack diagnostic modality allow investigator characterize subtypes OAB measure effect treatment bladder physiology . Newer image technique desperately need help guide treatment predict improve outcomes different treatment modality . Intravesical botulinum toxin minimally invasive treatment OAB refractory medical therapy . Despite widespread use intravesical botulinum toxin injection OAB refractory medical therapy , date optimal placement drug determine . Typically ten injection give , either disperse evenly across bladder two row five injection . However , remain unknown injection method optimize outcome reduce risk urinary retention Botox® . This lack knowledge direct result fact mechanism study effect Botox® bladder fill empty three-dimensional fashion . CineMRI-UDS provide mechanism , potential significantly improve care urologic education enhance understanding bladder physiology .</detailed_description>
