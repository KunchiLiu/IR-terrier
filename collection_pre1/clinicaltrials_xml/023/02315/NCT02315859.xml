	<detailed_description>Background 1 . Clinical Background : Heart failure widespread cause morbidity mortality worldwide . Despite similar clinical manifestation , systolic diastolic heart failure two distinct entity differ regard pathophysiology , diagnosis , prognosis treatment . Diastolic dysfunction occur early onset heart failure . In past , diastolic dysfunction often define per exclusionem heart failure absence evidence systolic dysfunction . This definition may appropriate clinical diagnosis concentric eccentric LV hypertrophy co-exists , physiologically mislead , since diastolic dysfunction continue persist even worsens onset systolic dysfunction . It consider symptom heart failure closely related diastolic systolic dysfunction . Furthermore , also prognosis heart failure seem closely related underlying degree diastolic rather systolic dysfunction . Despite clinical importance , however , large trial treatment outcome diastolic heart failure ( CHARM-preserved PEP-CHF trial ) scarce disappointing . Among numerous others , three important reason data scarcity : overestimation end-point event power analysis respective trial , lack therapeutic agent specifically target diastolic dysfunction , lack simple echocardiographic parameter capable measure diastolic function independently load condition . The latter address study present . As detailed , early-diastolic function inextricably link end-systolic condition ventricle . An echocardiographic parameter describe early-diastolic mechanical event therefore likely vary change end-systolic condition . The present study investigate new parameter early-diastolic function provoke contractility change . 1.2 Physiological Background : There doubt human heart suction-pump capable aspirate blood expel . There concept early-diastolic suction : systolic myocardial shorten believe store potential energy elastic fiber myocyte filament release early-diastole produce suction effect , thus contribute quick LV filling . In 1930 , Katz et al . first publish study describe suction phenomenon in-vitro preparation isolate beat turtle ventricle . They show early-diastolic volume increase ventricle coincide pressure fall , consistent concept suction . He conclude contraction relaxation alters elastic state ventricle two limit ( end-systolic -diastolic ) , propose suction effect produce elastic recoil . This view represent paradigm change , fill previously consider result atrial pressure . If suction define accord Katz , i.e . filling pressure decay , observe eject heart , regardless contractility , end-systolic volume fill pressure . This type suction corresponds early physiologist may call ventricular fill 'vis fronte ' : filling mechanism generate heart . It constitute suction effect relative filling reservoir . It occur result , elastic recoil relaxation . In physically stringent concept , suction define fill negative LV transmural pressure . According definition , ventricular wall performs work pull blood cavity . There two important condition suction event . First , end-systolic volume must lower volume elastic ventricular equilibrium , otherwise elastic energy would store . Second , early diastolic relaxation must quick enough allow restore force prevail vanish active force . The process suction last equilibrium volume reach . Atrial pressure stretch ventricle volume force balance filling pressure ventricular passive stress impedes flow ( diasthasis ) . Diasthasis volume probably higher elastic equilibrium volume , ventricular material property . Because LV fill quickly abolishes negative transmural pressure , equilibrium volume LV probably small , suction accord definition measure almost exclusively particular circumstance , nearly empty ventricle ( e.g . artificially low afterload ) , artificial absence filling , inotropic stimulation . 1.3 Concept Testing New Parameters : In current study , several step model reduction test . Each reduction intend allow non-invasive measurement become increasingly simple feasible reduce echo quality . The comparison gold standard reveal cost model reduction term precision predictive power . Since direct pressure measurement feasible non-invasively , simplification pump model mandatory . The useful reduce heart 1-dimensional , piston-like pump system move apico-basal direction ( longitudinal function ) . In model , contraction , also flow direction longitudinal . The 1-dimensional Euler equation use calculate instantaneous atrio-ventricular pressure gradient Color Doppler M-Mode echocardiogram . Similarly , apico-basal displacement 'piston ' easily measure M-Mode echocardiograms mitral annulus ( mitral annular plane systolic excursion , MAPSE ) . When combine , suction effect ventricle relative leave atrium assess . A simplification consist replace MAPSE widely use Doppler tissue imaging ( DTI ) -parameters systolic ( ' ) early-diastolic ( e ' ) velocity . The reference method study consist invasively measure suction work , new parameter directly compare . Objective The study perform prospectively test novel , non-invasive parameter early diastolic function respect ability quantify physiological phenomenon LV suction . Hypothesis : The follow parameter correlate significantly LV suction work , descend order magnitude ( r2 ) : absolute suction work pressure/MAPSE , relative suction work IVPG/MAPSE , e'/L0 , e'/s ' , ( rest Dobutamin ) . Methods Reference LV suction work : conductance-catheter introduce aortic valve place along longitudinal axis LV . Continuous conductance transform LV volume data simultaneous pressure measurement perform . Echo parameter : IVPG ( intraventricular pressure gradient ) calculate Color-Doppler M-Mode echocardiogram . This imaging modality produce color-coded , longitudinal forward-flow velocity profile ( y-axis ) time ( x-axis ) . Such velocity map process retrieve instantaneous pressure gradient two point longitudinal axis . MAPSE ( mitral annular plane systolic excursion ) perform M-Mode echocardiogram septal lateral mitral annulus . Tissue velocity : peak systolic velocity ( ' ) peak early-diastolic negative velocity ( e ' ) septal lateral mitral anulus measure pulsed-wave Doppler tissue imaging ( DTI ) .</detailed_description>
