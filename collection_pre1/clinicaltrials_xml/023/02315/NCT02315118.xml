	<brief_summary>Despite advancement chemotherapy , radiotherapy haematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) , recent introduction target therapy , substantial proportion patient B-cell malignancy , B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) still succumb malignancy . For CLL low-grade NHL , cure achievable HSCT aggressive approach justify initial therapy patient indolent disease ; disease progress , transplant either feasible ineffective . For high-grade B-cell NHL , availability Rituximab improve disease outcome treatment failure portend nearly inevitable death disease treatment-related complication . Thus , new , effective therapy patient B-cell malignancy urgently need . The present study translates recent laboratory finding clinical application . In patient B-cell malignancy receive anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab standard therapy , study aim assess feasibility safety , well explore efficacy , infuse autologous T-lymphocytes engineer express CD16-41BB-CD3zeta chimeric receptor mediate antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity . Receptor expression achieve electroporation mRNA .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Age : 6 month 80 year old . 2. ) Diagnosis aggressive CD20+ BNHL measurable tumor burden ( image , flow cytometry and/or PCR ) posttreatment . This include patient persistent disease follow 2 line chemotherapy , well patient relapse follow autologous transplantation , salvage therapy produce partial remission effective salvage therapy available . Patients bulky disease require immediate salvage therapy eligible . OR ii ) Diagnosis poor risk indolent CD20+ BNHL Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia . This include high risk CLL case early relapse ( &lt; 12 month follow purine analog contain treatment &lt; 24 month follow autologous transplant ) , 17p deletion need treatment , candidate ( refuse ) allogeneic transplantation . Patients advance progressive indolent BNHL relapse , refractory disease fail 2 line treatment ( include autologous transplantation ) may also consider . 3 . Shortening fraction great equal 25 % . 4 . Glomerular filtration rate great equal 50 ml/min/1.73 m2 . 5 . Pulse oximetry great equal 92 % room air . 6 . Direct bilirubin less equal 3.0 mg/dL ( 50 mmol/L ) . 7 . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) 2 time upper limit normal unless determine directly due disease . 8 .
