	<brief_summary>Study 1 cross-sectional investigation . Patients clinically stable bronchiectasis ( symptom , include cough frequency , sputum volume purulence , within normal daily variation ) undergo baseline assessment consist history taking , routine sputum culture , 16srRNA pyrosequencing , measurement sputum inflammatory marker , oxidative stress biomarkers MMPs , spirometry . Microbiota taxon compare bronchiectasis patient healthy subject . In study 2 , patient inform investigator upon symptom deterioration . Following diagnosis BEs , patient undergo aforementioned assessment soon possible . This entail antibiotic treatment , slightly modify protocol , base British Thoracic Society guideline [ 16 ] . At 1 week completion 14-day antibiotic therapy , patient undergo convalescence visit . Study 3 prospective 1-year follow-up scheme patient participate telephone hospital visit every 3 month . For individual visit , spirometry sputum culture perform , BEs meticulously capture clinical chart history inquiry , final decision adjudicate follow group discussion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis chronic airway disease characterize airway infection , inflammation destruction [ 1 ] . Bacteria frequently responsible vicious cycle see bronchiectasis . Clinically , potentially pathogenic microorganism ( PPMs ) primarily consist Hemophilus influenzae , Hemophilus parainfluenzae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ) , Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Streptococcus pneumoniae Moraxella catarrhalis [ 1 ] . These PPMs elicit airway inflammation [ 2-5 ] biofilm formation [ 6 ] lead oxidative stress [ 7,8 ] . However , different PPMs harbor vary effect bronchiectasis . For instance , P. aeruginosa link pronounced airway inflammation poorer lung function [ 9,10 ] . However , recognize routine sputum bacterial culture technique could effectively identify small proportion PPMs . The assay sensitivity specificity could significantly affect duration sample culture , culture medium environment . Pyrosequencing bacterial 16srRNA might offer comprehensive assessment airway microbiota . Based technique , Goleva associate [ 11 ] identify abundance gram-negative microbiota ( predominantly phylum proteobacteria ) might responsible corticosteroid insensitivity . The microbiome airway patient asthma [ 11,12 ] , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [ 13 ] bronchiectasis [ 14,15 ] also characterize . Furthermore , association `` core microbiota '' clinical parameter ( i.e. , FEV1 ) demonstrate . However , previous study suffer relatively small sample size lack comprehensive set clinical parameter analysis . Bronchiectasis exacerbation ( BEs ) characterize significantly worsen symptom ( ) sign warrant antibiotic therapy . The precise mechanism responsible trigger BEs fully elucidate , could relate virus infection increase bacterial virulence . However , recognize antibiotic , despite extensive bacterial resistance , remain effective BEs . This least partially suggest bacterial infection might play major role pathogenesis BEs . Therefore , assessment sputum microbiota steady-state , BEs convalescence may unravel insight dynamic variation microbiota composition principal microbiota phylum specie account BEs . In study , investigator seek perform 16srRNA pyrosequencing determine : 1 ) difference microbiota composition bronchiectasis patient healthy subject ; 2 ) association sputum microbiota composition clinical parameter , include systemic/airway inflammation , spirometry , disease severity , airway oxidative stress biomarkers matrix metalloproteinase ; 3 ) microbiota composition patient yield `` normal flora ( commensal ) '' , particular produce massive sputum daily ( &gt; 50ml/d ) ; 4 ) dynamic change microbiota composition BEs convalescence compare baseline level ; 5 ) utility predominant microbiota taxon predict lung function decline future risk BEs 1-year follow-up .</detailed_description>
