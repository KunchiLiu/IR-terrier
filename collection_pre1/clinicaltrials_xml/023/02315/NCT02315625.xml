	<brief_summary>Background : - Neuroendocrine tumor ( NETs ) come cell hormonal nervous system . Some people surgery shrink tumor . Sometimes tumor come back . Researchers think treatment drug base know defective gene might give good result . Objective : - To see drug select base defective gene result well tumor response . The drug sunitinib everolimus . Eligibility : - People age 18 old advance low- intermediate-grade gastrointestinal pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor . Design : - Participants screen : &lt; TAB &gt; - Medical history &lt; TAB &gt; - Physical exam &lt; TAB &gt; - Scans &lt; TAB &gt; - Blood , urine , lab test - The study team see participant surgery . - If yes , participant : - Sign separate consent - Have CT scan surgery - Have much tumor remove possible . A small piece test mutation type . - If , participant small piece tumor remove test . - If surgery might cure , participant leave study . The participant assign take either sunitinib everolimus . - Participants take drug mouth day . They keep medicine diary . Some keep track blood pressure least weekly . - Screening test may repeat study visit . Participants also may heart evaluate . - About 30 day last day study drug , participant follow-up visit repeat screen test . - Participants contact every 3 month visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Mutation-Targeted Therapy With Sunitinib Everolimus People With Advanced Low- Intermediate-Grade Neuroendocrine Tumors Gastrointestinal Tract Pancreas With Without Cytoreductive Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Neuroendocrine tumor ( NETs ) gastrointestinal tract pancreas rare heterogeneous group neoplasm unique tumor biology , natural history , clinical management issue . - Most NETs sporadic , part familial cancer syndromes multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( MEN1 ) , neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) Von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) syndrome . - Well-differentiated , low intermediate grade NETs heterogeneous natural history . - Surgery curative treatment option patient localize early stage NETs . - The optimal management strategy patient advanced NETs unknown . - The majority NETs somatic mutation MEN1 CDKN1B , gene involve PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway , and/or overexpression growth factor receptor VEGF , VEGFR , PDGF , PDGFR target therapy . - Survival patient NETs somatic mutation well patient wild type NETs . - Sunitinib ( multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) everolimus ( mTOR signal pathway inhibitor ) currently approve treatment progressive , unresectable , locally advanced metastatic pancreatic NETs . - However , mutation target therapy sunitinib everolimus study patient population . - It also unknown whether treatment beneficial patient advanced NETs cytoreductive surgery . - The present proposal aim determine mutation target therapy without surgery patient advance low- intermediate grade NETs effective historically expect result . Objectives : -To determine progression-free survival patient NETs gastrointestinal tract pancreas treat sunitinib everolimus base tumor genotyping without surgical resection . Eligibility : -Patients : - progressive , histologically cytologically diagnose low intermediate grade locally advance metastatic NETs . - Age great equal 18 year Design : - Pilot Phase II open label clinical trial . - Patients undergo surgical resection medically indicated tumor tissue procurement . - Tumor biopsy tumor genotyping perform patient surgical candidate MEN1 , VHL NF1 . - Patients somatic germline mutation MEN1/PDGFR/KIT/FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 treat sunitinib . - Patients somatic/germline mutation NF1/PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR/VHL treat everolimus . - Patients wildtype tumor treat sunitinib . - Patients disease-progression either sunitinib everolimus cross-over drug . - Treatment continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , consent withdrawal . - Up 120 patient accrue study . It anticipate 20-30 patient per year may enroll trial ; thus accrual may complete 4-5 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Progressive , histologically cytologically diagnose low intermediate grade , neuroendocrine tumor confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI . Disease progression define accord RECIST criterion progression disease new lesion see 68Gallium DOTATATE within 18 month prior enrolment . 2 . Age great equal 18 year , incidence prevalence metastatic pancreatic gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor pediatric patient population exceedingly rare ( child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial ) . 3 . Patients must measurable disease accord RECIST criterion anatomic imaging study ( CT scan MRI ) . 4 . Willingness undergo tumor biopsy patient know familial cancer syndrome ( MEN1 , VHL NF1 ) . Archival tissue , available , use fresh tumor biopsy option . 5 . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ) . 6 . Patients must normal organ bone marrow function define : hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL * leukocytes great equal 3,000/mcL * absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL * platelet great equal institutional low limit normal total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal ( less equal 5 time ULN patient liver metastasis ) creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) patient creatinine level institutional normal . INR le equal 2 ; If patient bone marrow function fall indicated value think related prior treatment hematology consult order . If Hematology deem patient safe proceed treatment allow enroll study . In case , patient absolute neutrophil count must great 1,000/mcl , hemoglobin must great 7.5 g/dL platelet count must &gt; 75,000 mcL . Each patient also see medical oncologist followup visit . 7 . Fasting serum cholesterol less equal 300 mg/dL OR le equal 7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride less equal 2.5x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lowering medication ; 8 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) partner WOCBP participate study must agree use highly effective contraception treatment least 8 week end treatment , effect sunitinib everolimus develop human fetus unknown .
