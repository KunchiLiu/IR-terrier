	<brief_summary>Background : - Gene therapy involve change gene inside body cell stop disease . It closely regulate . People therapy may problem month even year later . Researchers know long-term side effect , want study people therapy . They want study continue next 15 year . Objective : - To study time negative side effect genetically engineer cellular therapy . This studied people Pediatric Oncology Branch ( POB ) gene therapy trial . Eligibility : - People currently previously research study gene therapy National Cancer Institute POB . Design : - Participants blood test right get genetically change cell . They get cell part another study . - For next year , come back clinic see doctor home least every 3 month . They answer question health blood drawn . - For next 5 year , go clinic see doctor year . They physical exam blood drawn . - For 10 year , ask every year health information . - Participants keep contact information date researcher . They may phone health information . - If participant 18 year old give gene therapy turn 18 follow-up , ask sign new consent form turn 18 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Follow-Up Evaluation Gene-Therapy-Related Delayed Adverse Events After Participation Pediatric Oncology Branch Clinical Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Study subject expose gene therapy intervention may risk delay long term adverse consequence . The U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) issue Guidance Industry : Gene Therapy Clinical Trials Observing Participants Delayed Adverse Events , outline framework ass risk gene therapy-related delayed adverse event essential element appropriate conduct long-term follow observations1 . - Accordingly vector design ( i.e . use adenovirus ) , base duration persistence accompany cumulative preclinical clinical evidence , may require short period observation vector design ( i.e . use lentivirus ) . Objectives : - To conduct long term safety evaluation administration genetically engineer cellular therapy subject participate POB clinical trial . Eligibility : - Subjects receive least one dose genetically engineer cellular therapy POB gene therapy clinical trial eligible participate . - Examples POB clinical trial genetically engineer cellular therapy product include , limited : 12-C-0112/anti-CD19 CAR transduce T cell ; 11-C-0113/anti-NY-ESO-1 TCR transduce T cell ; 14-C-0059/anti-GD2 CAR transduce T cell . Design : - Subjects evaluate long term safety occurrence adverse event accord requirement establish POB gene therapy parent protocol , FDA guidance NIH Guidelines Research Involving Recombinant Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules ( NIH Guidelines ) , include : - Long term follow genetically engineer cellular therapy : - Post-cell infusion evaluation T-Cell persistence ( applicable ) - Monitoring replication-competent retrovirus ( RCR ) replication-competent lentivirus ( RCL ) - For 5 year : Physical examination medical history - For 10 additional year : Complete Questionnaire</detailed_description>
