	<brief_summary>Outpatient service Germany le control external quality assurance program . Comprehensive outcome data benchmarking health-care decision-making miss e.g . day case surgery . A quality-of-life instrument specific hernia repair mesh recently propose ( Carolinas Comfort Scale , CCS ) .This study evaluate integration CSS part multicentre quality assurance scheme day-case ( outpatient ) surgery.b.The Study Group `` Quality assurance ambulatory hernia surgery '' develop standardized Operation technique 3D Implants . As consequence , deviation must document standard . The extension center accord standardized protocol take place ( shadow learn operational standard , train documentation , Minimum quantity 30 intervention per year , etc . ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Rationale 1 . In care inguinal hernia exist considerable diversity method . Germany expect experience significant shift service delivery inpatient outpatient care within next year . As result , need quality-controlled procedure ambulatory use emerge . 2 . A first register phase open inguinal hernia design 2010 almost finish . After evaluation approximately 6,000 patient record , process consider extremely successful . 3 . As central result first register phase already state integration 3D mesh standardized process prove extremely effective open inguinal hernia . In examined relevant parameter , quality care well status quo could exhibit . 4 . This data quality unique hernia care Germany . In Contrast , result also achieve considerable international attention . Hence , work group receive Fruchaud prize present result American Hernia Society 2013 . ( see Annex , www.americanherniasociety.org ) - Objective . Since approach proven successful first register phase every respect , continue another two year order develop basis establish concept widespread ( outpatient ) standard . The central question investigate whether outstanding result register phase 1 also occur wide distribute application center . If prove , condition base worldwide unique scientific data ( methodology follow-up rate , see ) create establish standard surgical procedure central integration 3D mesh ( UPP UHS ) gold standard Lichtenstein method outpatient sector . - Design 1 . Prospective multicenter observational study online-based ( daily update ) record relevant pre- , peri-and postoperative data , include patient- well physician-specific follow . 2 . Analysis relevant patient-specific endpoint recurrence , pain quality life 4 , 12 52 week follow-up use psychometrically validate Carolina Comfort Scale ( anonymous tamper-resistant ) . 3 . Significant expansion participate center special comparison quality result newly add center center , proven already . 4 . Duration : 01/01/2014 - 12/31/2015 additional one-year follow-up 12/31/2016 .</detailed_description>
