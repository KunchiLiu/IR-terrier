	<brief_title>Comprehensive Patient Questionnaires Predicting Complications Older Patients With Gynecologic Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether preoperative geriatric assessment ( GA ) -gynecology ( GYN ) score associated major post-operative complication elderly patient undergo open primary cytoreduction surgery . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore association individual variable preoperative geriatric assessment major post-operative complication patient undergo open primary cytoreduction surgery . II . To assess association preoperative GA-GYN score cytoreducibility define extent residual disease patient undergo open primary cytoreduction surgery . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate whether preoperative GA-GYN score obtain neoadjuvant chemotherapy associate major postoperative complication elderly patient undergo open interval cytoreduction surgery . II . To describe reason surgeon center open cytoreduction surgery standard care choose perform interval surgery v primary surgery , explore association preoperative GA-GYN score decision perform primary surgery interval surgery surgery . III . To collect follow specific information elderly woman suspect ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma advance stage papillary serous uterine carcinoma treat center consider open cytoreduction surgery standard care : ( 1 ) percentage patient treat primary open cytoreduction vs. interval open cytoreduction vs. surgery ( 2 ) ascertain extent cytoreduction . IV . To determine whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy associate change GA-GYN score change compare GA-GYN score obtain neoadjuvant chemotherapy . V. To determine whether 30-day readmission rate cytoreductive surgery correlate GA-GYN score . OUTLINE : At time consent within 14 day surgery , patient complete pre-operative geriatric assessment evaluate functional status , comorbid medical condition , psychological state , social support , nutritional status . Post-operative complication also collect 6 week surgery date patient initiate restart chemotherapy whichever first .</detailed_description>
