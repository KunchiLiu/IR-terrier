	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify potential marker curve progression adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS ) . Despite prevalence impact child health , etiology AIS molecular mechanism underlie development progression remain poorly understood . Clinical criterion feature adequately predict child , diagnose mild disease , undergo subsequent curve progression require intervention . The investigator hypothesize alteration specific genetic marker correlate progression AIS curve time . Thus , marker could use future develop reliable , inexpensive relatively non-invasive cell base diagnostic test ( 1 ) predict spinal curve progression AIS , ( 2 ) select patient likely benefit early surgical intervention , ( 3 ) potentially screen asymptomatic child risk develop idiopathic scoliosis .</brief_summary>
