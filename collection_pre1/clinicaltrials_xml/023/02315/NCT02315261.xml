	<brief_title>Effectiveness Epidural Anesthesia Thoracic Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidural analgesia recommend perioperative analgesia patient major surgery order significantly reduce pain score , minimize patient distress accelerate postoperative recovery especially major operation This technique report provide good pain control less postoperative fatigue compare patient receive general anesthesia alone.Additionally , recommend patient major surgery allow patient mobilize quickly effective mobilization.This technique show highly efficient prevent postoperative ileus various complication . Moreover , epidural analgesic technique demonstrate safe few side effect use intravenous opioids alone . However , epidural technique universally successful number patient experience inadequate analgesia technique approximately 12-32 % . The failure epidural analgesia still frequent clinical problem need active management include new block analgesic medication order rescue postoperative pain . Previous study show incidence patient epidural analgesia postoperative moderate pain 20.9 % severe pain 7.8 % . In Siriraj Hospital , recent study show 19.6 % patient elective upper abdominal surgery general anesthesia combine epidural analgesia report severe first pain score post anesthetic care unit.27 As result severe pain , patient need number intervention management acute pain service , finally spend long time post anesthetic care unit . Inadequate pain control patient receive epidural analgesia frequently occur clinical practice number success rate failure rate report hospital . This study aim evaluate effectiveness epidural analgesia patient elective thoracic abdominal surgery general anesthesia combine epidural analgesia Siriraj Hospital .</detailed_description>
