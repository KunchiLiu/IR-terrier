	<brief_summary>Different study propose use zirconia abutment improve aesthetic outcome anterior sextant , however result inconclusive . A tendency towards well aesthetic result use zirconia instead titanium abutment observe , although technical complication also recorded.The use zirconia abutment anterior maxillary region show tendency towards well matching , although difference significant . In addition , abutment technical complication observe , increase cost time . More study large sample longer observation period need recommend use zirconia abutment clinical situation</brief_summary>
