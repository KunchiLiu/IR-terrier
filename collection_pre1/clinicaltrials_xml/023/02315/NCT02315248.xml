	<brief_summary>The purpose study validate human saliva sample analyzer technique design screen low bone density osteoporosis . The analyzer technique meant simple , noninvasive , easy-to-use , cost-effective , routine mean diagnose bone turnover use point-of-care device monitor salivary marker bone turnover screen patient population risk low bone density osteoporosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Salivary-based Bone Loss Marker Detection Platform Point-of-care Screening - Phase II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : To validate performance human saliva sample analyzer LFA technique bone density measure quantitative compute tomography ( QCT ) . Secondary objective : To validate performance human saliva sample analyzer LFA technique salivary ELISA method ( gold standard ) . Number sit : Single site University Mississippi Medical Center The purpose prospective Phase II observational study refine proprietary device test screen population compose woman 50 year age old risk low bone density osteoporosis ( N=200 ) . After screen inclusion exclusion criterion obtain informed consent , participant provide salivary sample undergo quantitative compute tomography ( QCT ) visit ( Visit 1 , Day 0 ) . No additional visit plan . Bone mineral density ( BMD ) measure diagnostic radiologist use QCT technique serve gold standard study . Salivary sample analyze lab UMMC concentration osteocalcin ( OC ) deoxypyridinoline ( DPD ) use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) technique , blind BMD measurement . De-identified cod salivary sample ship IOS measure concentration OC DPD use lateral flow assay ( LFA ) , blind BMD measurement .</detailed_description>
