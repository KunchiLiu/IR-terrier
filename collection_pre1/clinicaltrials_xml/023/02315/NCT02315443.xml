	<brief_title>Field Randomization NA-1 Therapy Early Responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NA-1 develop emergency drug aim reduce global disability patient acute cerebral ischemia administer early symptom onset . The primary objective determine efficacy NA-1 reduce global disability patient acute stroke . The secondary objective determine efficacy NA-1 reduce functional dependence , improve neurological outcome , increase proportion subject whose symptom fully return baseline function within 24 hour symptom onset , improve activity daily living.The lead safety objective determine effect administer target dose 2.60 mg/kg IV infusion NA-1 early symptom onset paramedic field serious adverse event 90-day mortality . This trial multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , single dose study initiate prehospital ambulance . It conduct use Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) Toronto Peel Region , ON Vancouver , BC , Canada . Subjects suspect acute stroke identify field train paramedic use approve stroke protocol use local EMS system , screen eligibility approval on-call trial physician . The paramedic administer study drug . Upon arrival emergency department , subject receive standard-of-care . The primary hypothesis test administration NA-1 result low proportion subject global disability Day 90 assess Modified Rankin Scale . An independent , central adjudication committee responsible arrive final diagnosis acute cerebral ischemia versus alternate diagnosis . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee perform safety review clinical data .</detailed_description>
