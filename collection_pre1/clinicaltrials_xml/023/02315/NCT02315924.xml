	<brief_summary>Intracranial atherosclerosis common vascular lesion Asian acute stroke patient intracranial atherosclerosis patient high rate coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Moreover , several study show obvious association CAD cerebrovascular stenosis , prove increase risk stroke coronary revascularization include coronary bypass surgery percutaneous coronary intervention . In addition , efficacy safety combine coronary cerebral intervention fully investigate . Hence , aim study evaluate prevalence characteristic coronary cerebrovascular arteriosclerosis measure combined coronary cerebral angiography , explore relationship inflammation , atherosclerosis-related marker coronary cerebral atherosclerosis compare efficacy safety simultaneous stag coronary cerebral interventional strategy Chinese Patients . The coronary angiography cerebrovascular angiography perform participant . The combined strategy coronary cerebrovascular angiography carry routinely investigator institution . Simultaneous strategy consider performed via access within day . Staged strategy intend perform within 7 day first procedure . The sequence angiography establish individual patient basis cardiovascular neurointerventional team accord clinical symptom patient coronary cerebrovascular angiography . After combined coronary cerebral angiography , simultaneous stag interventional strategy perform patient severe coronary cerebral stenosis . Blood sample obtain artery sheath perform coronary cerebral angiography . Lipid level , inflammation atherosclerosis-related marker measure study .</brief_summary>
