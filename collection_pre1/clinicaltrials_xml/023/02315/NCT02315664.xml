	<brief_summary>Physical activity essential first-line treatment patient knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) . However , 2013 systematic review find 13 % meet activity recommendation 150 minute per week . The primary goal randomize control trail ass efficacy physical activity counsel model , involve group education session , use Fitbit Flex ( wireless physical activity track device ) , online/telephone coach physiotherapist ( PT ) , improve physical activity reduce sedentary time patient knee OA . Engaging regular physical activity additional benefit improve cognitive functioning .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MONITOR-OA : Using Wearable Activity Trackers Improve Physical Activity Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project address Research Question : Can non-intrusive physical activity track tool , combine group education session advice physiotherapist ( PT ) , increase physical activity patient knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) ? The investigator focus knee OA common ( affect 1 10 ) debilitating . Being physically active improves pain , mobility quality life ; however , less half patient active . Combining best evidence OA care digital technology , investigator propose new model care improve physical activity patient OA . Our primary objective determine whether model involve 1 ) group education session , 2 ) use Fitbit Flex , commercially available physical activity tracker , 3 ) remote coach PT improve physical activity reduce sedentary time patient knee OA . This model care line goal Mary Pack Arthritis Program ( MPAP ) optimize activity independence OA patient MPAP 's available human resource . In proof-of-concept randomized control trial ( RCT ) , investigator hypothesize compare control group ( i.e . Delayed Intervention group ) , participant Immediate Intervention Group 1 ) increase moderate/vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) , 2 ) reduce sedentary time , 3 ) improve OA disease status , 4 ) improve self-efficacy OA management , 4 ) To examine whether individual Intervention Group show improve cognitive function intervention period compare control group , 5 ) To examine pre-intervention factor predict degree individual Intervention Group increase MVPA reduce sedentary time . The investigator use mixed-methods approach , involve RCT in-depth interview . The proof-of-concept study employ step wedge RCT design , whereby intervention sequentially roll participant number time period . The order individual receive intervention determine random . The strength design properly address efficacy question , avoid dilemma withhold intervention participant , parallel group design .</detailed_description>
