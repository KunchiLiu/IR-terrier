	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well cabozantinib-s-malate work treat patient ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cavity cancer come back grow , spread , get bad . Cabozantinib-s-malate may stop growth tumor cell block growth new blood vessel necessary tumor growth also block enzyme need cell growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib-S-Malate Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate anti-tumor activity cabozantinib ( XL184 ) ( cabozantinib-s-malate ) woman persistent recurrent clear cell ovarian cancer , base proportion patient survive progression-free least 6 month proportion objective tumor response ( complete partial ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine nature , frequency maximum degree toxicity assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) 4 cabozantinib ( XL184 ) . II . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient persistent recurrent clear cell ovarian cancer treat cabozantinib ( XL184 ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine expression phosphatase tensin homolog gene ( PTEN ) , phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( pAKT ) , cyclin E , meet proto-oncogene ( MET ) formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tumor . II . To examine MET amplification ( fluorescence situ hybridization ) tumor specimens relationship response . OUTLINE : Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
