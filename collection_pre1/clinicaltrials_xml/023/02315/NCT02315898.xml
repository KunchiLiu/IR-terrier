	<brief_summary>Plastic bronchitis ( PB ) rare , often pediatric disease characterize formation obstructive airway cast primarily compose fibrin . There presently FDA-approved pharmacotherapy PB , acute exacerbation illness often treat inhaled tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) . To date , do somewhat anecdotally safety efficacy test treatment . In addition , presently reliable surrogate marker adverse drug event . Nevertheless , absence inhale tPA treatment , PB-induced respiratory distress severe , often warrant urgent emergent bronchoscopy cast removal , sometimes result respiratory failure . As significant unmet need safety efficacy test inhaled tPA biomarkers drug response . Objectives Endpoints : The objective protocol : 1 ) test safety efficacy inhale tPA regimen child PB ; 2 ) identify potential candidate biomarkers inhale tPA drug response . Safety endpoint consist development new , active bleeding systemic and/or pulmonary and/or new hematuria ( define gross hematuria 2+ microscopic hematuria ) . Secondary endpoint efficacy also measure ( e.g. , frequency cast production ) . Urine blood also collect development potential biomarkers inhale tPA drug response .</brief_summary>
