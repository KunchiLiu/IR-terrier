	<brief_summary>Background : - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) chronic lung disease become bad time . There currently effective treatment . Researchers want study disease learn new way treat . Objectives : - To discover new pathway involve pulmonary fibrosis . To develop new drug may use treat pulmonary fibrosis . Eligibility : - People least 18 year old IPF . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year old . Design : - Participants screen medical history , questionnaire , physical exam . They blood , lung , walk test chest scan . - All participant 1 study visit , include : - Medical history physical exam . - Questions breathe . - Blood test . - Breathing test . - Six-minute walk test . - Pregnancy test . - Chest x-ray ( healthy volunteer ) chest CT scan ( people pulmonary fibrosis ) . - Small area skin may remove . - Genetic test blood skin sample . Participants probably inform finding . Samples may use make stem cell use research . Participants may contact future give consent research . - Some participant repeat visit many year , repeat many study test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization Apolipoprotein A-I Pathways Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) chronic progressive disease occur primarily old individual , 55 75 year age , median survival approximately 3 year time diagnosis . At present , effective treatment patient IPF . Levels apolipoprotein A-I ( apoA-I ) find reduced lung patient IPF , administration human apoA-I show reduce bleomycin-induced collagen deposition murine model . Here , would like ass whether apoA-I pathway modify lung cell biology patient IPF . This specimen procurement , clinical phenotyping genotyping protocol ass whether holo-apoA-I apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide , attenuate key pathogenic manifestation IPF , proliferation extracellular matrix generation pulmonary fibroblast , may serve evidence support future human clinical trial apoA-I treatment IPF . Furthermore , identification new apoA-I responsive gene pathway mediate fibroblast proliferation IPF may provide insight disease pathogenesis identify new therapeutic target . Lastly , induce pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cell successfully show model responsiveness lung cell apoA-I therapy , approach may expand goal provide personalized medicine analysis could future guide selection effective therapy individual patient .</detailed_description>
