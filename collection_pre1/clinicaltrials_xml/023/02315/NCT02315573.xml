	<brief_summary>This study focus compare patient ' pain score visual analogue scale ( VAS ) difference analgesic use post-operatively ( prescription define maximum frequency ) lidocaine epinephrine &amp; bupivacaine epinephrine local anesthetic wide-awake hand surgery . The investigator ' hypothesis state longer act local anesthetic agent ( bupivacaine ) would able provide good postoperative pain relief demonstrate low pain score VAS less analgesic use ( recorded patient 's log ) . This mainly obvious first 24 hour postoperative period pain usually maximum level start decline thereafter . If investigator ' hypothesis true , may potentially change practice many hand surgeon towards routine use longer act local anesthetic particularly wide-awake hand surgery , perhaps could extrapolate surgical specialty . Further , reduction postoperative analgesic use would paramount clinical importance , would reduce potential side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study well understand difference two commonly use local anesthetic carpal tunnel surgery . This study explore difference term patient satisfaction surgery ( measure VAS ) , pain surgery ( measure VAS ) , need pain medication surgery ( patient annotate log give time medication take needed analgesia ) . Wide awake hand surgery ( freeze limb fully awake ) recently popularize faster safer patient compare hand surgery general anesthesia sedation . Advantages include fast recovery risk general anesthesia . In order freeze wrist undergo carpal tunnel surgery , local anesthetic inject nerve wrist . Among commonly use anesthetic agent Lidocaine ( short duration anesthesia ) Bupivacaine ( long duration anesthesia ) . Until , enough evidence support use one anesthetic agent . Furthermore , previous study look perception pain patient 's perspective use different anesthetic agent . There NO change standard medical care patient receive whether patient decide participate study . Patients join study receive anesthetic agent use procedure patient decide participate . The difference collect clinical data participant ask participant complete two questionnaire regard surgical experience , perceive level pain two day follow surgery . As well , participant ask keep simple log pain medication consume two day surgery . Patients ' total participation time take 30 minute . Patients ' decision participate study help doctor future decide two used anesthetic agent ( Lidocaine Bupivacaine ) give patient best experience surgery . As well , help reduce pain patient experience surgery , well reduce need pain medication surgery .</detailed_description>
