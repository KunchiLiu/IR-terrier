	<detailed_description>Patients diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , especially long duration diabetes , insulin treatment chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) vulnerable patient exhibit high risk cardiac arrhythmia sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) [ 1 , 2 ] . Various factor presence coronary heart disease , diabetic cardiomyopathy well autonomic neuropathy underlie pathology associate development potentially fatal arrhythmias patient hypoglycemic event consider directly trigger arrhythmia . In 1991 , Tattersall colleague first describe phenomenon sudden nocturnal death young patient type 1 diabetes report many patient recent nocturnal hypoglycemia episode [ 3 ] . Therefore postulate severe hypoglycemia may lead cardiac arrhythmia , later summarize `` dead bed '' syndrome [ 4 ] . In addition , recent data large cardiovascular outcome trial patient type 2 diabetes suggest severe hypoglycemia associate increase risk cardiovascular event cardiovascular relate death [ 5 ] . Moreover , CKD markedly increase risk hypoglycemia even moderate impairment kidney function ( eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min ) associate significant increase SCD [ 6 ] . Various pathophysiological mechanism may contribute increase cardiovascular mortality hypoglycemia include hypoglycemia-induced release catecholamine , pro-arrhythmogenic ECG alteration , inflammatory change , direct effect vascular wall impaired endothelial function well abnormalities coagulation platelet function [ 7 , 8 ] . Morphological functional alteration heart occur CKD contribute mechanism . Several small study perform simultaneous glucose monitoring ECG recording address question whether spontaneous hypoglycemic event patient diabetes directly lead cardiac arrhythmias [ 9-11 ] , hitherto clear association find . These study limit short duration glucose ECG monitoring fact 3 lead Holter-ECGs use , thus allow assessment sophisticated ECG abnormality QT dispersion , T-wave alternans , late potential . Therefore clear data exist predict arrhythmia SCD relation hypoglycemia patient diabetes . Ideally , SCD risk score could identify characterize high-risk patient date little known hypoglycemia-associated ECG marker identification patient risk arrhythmias SCD . In general population , various ECG risk marker SCD identify heart rate , cardiac rhythm abnormality , AV block , QT length , QT dispersion , heart-rate variability ( HRV ) , T-wave alternans , late potential , well left- ( LBBB ) right-bundle branch block ( RBBB ) ( review [ 12 ] ) . In patient diabetes hypoglycemia , diabetic cardiomyopathy , well presence autonomic neuropathy may lead ECG abnormality . Under experimental condition ECG surrogate parameter study patient diabetes association hypoglycemia . As , clamp study reveal hypoglycemia prolongs QT interval increase QT dispersion ( difference long shortest QT interval 12-lead Holter ECG ) [ 10 , 13 ] , conjunction increase release catecholamine hypoglycemia may promote ventricular arrhythmia . In addition , control hypoglycemia patient type 1 diabetes alters cardiac repolarization change T-wave amplitude [ 11 ] . Sparse data exist effect spontaneous hypoglycemic episode change ECG parameter small study patient type 1 diabetes demonstrate nocturnal hypoglycemia associate decrease low-frequency component heart rate variability [ 14 ] . To date , sophisticated marker QT dispersion ( difference long shortest QT interval 12-lead Holter ECG ) , late potential , T-wave alternans ( periodic beat-to-beat variation morphology , amplitude time T wave ECGs ) examine `` real-life setting '' , likely marker require 12 lead ECG registration long duration . However , establishment risk algorithm prediction hypoglycemia-associated arrhythmias mandatory perform long duration simultaneous glucose monitor 12 lead ECG registration capture ECG risk marker SCD .</detailed_description>
