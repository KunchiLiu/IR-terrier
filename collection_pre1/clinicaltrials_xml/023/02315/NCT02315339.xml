	<brief_summary>The European Home Mechanical Ventilation Registry ( EHMVR ) enable thorough evaluation HMV document characteristic HMV patient treatment . This facilitate prospective , observational study identify primary indication HMV , describe pattern HMV use European country , characterize change initiation utilization HMV time . The registry target adult individual indication HMV . In EHMVR , patient data routine clinical care document use electronic case report form ( eCRF ) . The eCRF record : patient demographic data ; diagnostic information ( include primary diagnosis , 6-minute walk time , presence depression , quality life ) ; blood gas ; ventilation treatment ( include type ventilator , mode setting , interface use ) ; follow-up data ( include failure rate , side effect , technical issue ) . An initial Pilot Phase launch aim enrol least 200 patient 6-month period determine feasibility registry . Steering committee member institution main participant Pilot Phase . After completion Pilot Phase , registry expand across Europe goal enrol approximately 10,000 patient 5 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The data ( baseline follow-up ) collect part routine clinical care . In clinical practice , HMV initiation , first control examination ( follow-up number one ) nocturnal diagnostics take place within first 4-8 week . Annual follow-up require , recommended subsequent control visit perform 1-2 time year . Each patient include 5 year ( total duration registry ) .</detailed_description>
