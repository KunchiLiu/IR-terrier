	<detailed_description>This multicenter ( 1 hospital medical school team work study ) , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , parallel group ( group participant treat time ) , placebo-controlled ( study experimental treatment procedure compare pretend treatment drug test drug real effect ) , double-blind ( neither physician participant know treatment participant receives ) study . All eligible participant randomly assign receive 1 8 vaccine regimen . Participants receive study vaccine ( Ad26.Mos.HIV , MVA-Mosaic , gp140 DP , placebo ) 4 time per assign regimen . The study comprise Screening Period ( 4 week ) , Vaccination Period ( participant vaccinate Baseline ( Week 0 ) , Week 12 , Week 24 Week 48 ) , Follow-up Period ( 48 week ) . A long-term follow-up period ( approximately 2 year Week 96 ) continue participant randomize regimen subsequently select future study , base analysis Week 28 data . If Week 28 data inconclusive , Week 52 data consider regimen selection . If clear decision make , extend follow-up period could include participant 1 group assess durability immune response . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
