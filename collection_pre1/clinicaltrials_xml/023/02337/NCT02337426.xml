	<brief_summary>This phase 1 trial study side effect best dose dimethyl fumarate give together temozolomide radiation therapy ( RT ) treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . Dimethyl fumarate may help radiation therapy work well make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Giving dimethyl fumarate temozolomide radiation therapy may work well treat glioblastoma multiforme .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) dimethyl fumarate ( DMF ) combine standard concurrent temozolomide RT subject newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety , tolerance , toxicity DMF combine standard concurrent temozolomide RT subject newly diagnose GBM . II . To obtain preliminary estimate efficacy DMF combine standard concurrent temozolomide RT subject newly diagnose GBM . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study dimethyl fumarate . CONCOMITANT THERAPY : Between 21 day ( 3 week ) 42 day ( 6 week ) follow last surgical procedure , patient receive temozolomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 42-49 day dimethyl fumarate PO twice daily ( BID ) thrice daily ( TID ) continuously . Patients also undergo radiation therapy 5 day week 6 week total 30 fraction . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients continue receive dimethyl fumarate PO BID TID continuously . Four week complete concomitant temozolomide radiation therapy , patient also receive temozolomide PO QD day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 2 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
