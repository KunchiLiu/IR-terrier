	<brief_summary>In research study , investigator look determine effectiveness Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) give bevacizumab give alone treatment recurrent glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . This study also test safety tolerability Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) give alone bevacizumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab +/- Bevacizumab Recurrent GBM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) humanize monoclonal antibody . An antibody common type protein make body response foreign substance . Antibodies attack foreign substance protect infection . Antibodies also produce laboratory use treat patient , antibody make lab also know humanized monoclonal antibody . There several approve antibody therapy cancer disease . Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) study lab experiment type cancer . Information study suggest Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) may beneficial type cancer . Bevacizumab , also know Avastin , approve FDA treat recurrent GBM . Bevacizumab anti-angiogenic medicine , mean block blood vessel form could supply tumor nutrient oxygen . If participate study , `` randomize '' one two study group ; Cohort A Cohort B. Randomization mean put group chance . It like flip coin . Neither research doctor choose group . You approximately 60 % chance place Cohort A approximately 40 % chance place Cohort B . Study Groups : - Cohort A : study drug , Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) + bevacizumab - Cohort B : Study drug , Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 )</detailed_description>
