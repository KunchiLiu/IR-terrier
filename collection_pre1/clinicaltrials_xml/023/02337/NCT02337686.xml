	<brief_title>Pharmacodynamic Study Pembrolizumab Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute Days 1 21 42-day study cycle . On Day 22 Cycle 1 , surgery part routine care . After recover surgery ( may take around 14-21 day ) , start receive pembrolizumab Day 1 Cycle 2 . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test , check well blood clot , check thyroid function . This blood draw also include pregnancy test become pregnant . - Urine collect routine test . On Day 21 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - You MRI brain check status disease . On Day 22 Cycle 1 , surgery remove tumor . You sign separate consent form describe procedure risk . In addition surgery : - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - Blood ( 7 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . - Leftover tumor tissue surgery collect used biomarker test . As early possible surgery , MRI brain check status disease . The study staff let know do . On Days 1 21 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 3 , 6 , 9 , blood ( 7 tablespoon ) also draw biomarker test . On Day 1 Cycles 3 beyond , MRI brain check status disease . At time study , extra test may perform test may repeat study doctor think need . The study doctor tell extra test . Length Treatment : You may continue receive pembrolizumab 2 year . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 30 day last study drug dose , visit clinic . At visit : : You physical exam . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If stop study drug intolerable side effect , every 8 week last study drug dose , MRI brain check status disease . If disease get bad , blood ( 7 tablespoon ) draw biomarker test . Follow-Up : Every 3 month end-of-treatment visit , study staff call ask feel ask new cancer treatment may receive . These call take 5-10 minute time . This investigational study . Pembrolizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment type melanoma . Its use brain tumor study investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 20 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
