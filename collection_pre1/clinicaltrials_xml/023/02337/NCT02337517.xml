	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well vismodegib work treat patient chronic graft-versus-host disease respond previous steroid treatment . Chronic graft-versus-host disease cause build-up scar tissue skin lead symptom sclerodermatous skin change , dry mouth , dry eye , narrow esophagus , vaginal graft-versus-host disease . Vismodegib may work build-up scar tissue well treatment chronic graft-versus-host disease cause hematopoietic stem cell transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vismodegib Treating Patients With Steroid-Refractory Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical effect GDC-0449 ( vismodegib ) , steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety GDC-0449 patient steroid-refractory GVHD . II . To determine change National Institutes Health ( NIH ) consensus criterion ( CC ) global score chronic GVHD 6 12 month baseline . III . To determine one-year non relapse mortality ( NRM ) one-year relapse rate . IV . To determine one-year failure free survival ( FFS ) one-year overall survival ( OS ) . V. To determine baseline clinical characteristic may associate decreased FFS . OUTLINE : Patients receive vismodegib orally ( PO ) daily 6-12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 6 month .</detailed_description>
