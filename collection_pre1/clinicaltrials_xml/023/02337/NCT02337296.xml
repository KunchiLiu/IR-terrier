	<brief_summary>This study include novel intervention entitle `` ADHERE , '' include one semi-structured 30-minute face-to-face session three 10-minute weekly phone session 4 week , administer advanced practice nurse ( APRN ) promote management symptom adherence patient prescribed oral anti-cancer agent . Innovations cancer treatment change treatment delivery landscape . It project 2015 , 25 % treatment deliver pill form . This shift treatment paradigm place great responsibility patient . However , patient cancer know miss much one-third prescribed dose oral agent require treatment disease . Barriers oral agent adherence include symptom severity , low self-efficacy , depressive symptom , lack motivation , belief medicine help , age , regimen complexity . The therapeutic outcome take oral agent depend heavily ability patient adhere prescribe regimen . Thus , critical need exist test intervention promote adherence symptom management patient take oral agent . ADHERE provide systematic patient education ( PE ) investigator evidence-based Medication Management Symptom Management Toolkit ( Toolkit ) . This combined brief cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) focus thought beliefs influence action ; motivational interviewing ( MI ) elicit reason patient take action . The National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) , Oncology Nursing Society ( ONS ) make adherence oral agent priority .

	<detailed_description>Purpose/Aims : Over 50 oral agent pill form currently market , projection three year , 25 % cancer treatment deliver pill form patient assume responsibility self-management home . For oral agent achieve therapeutically effective level cancer treatment , patient must strictly adhere regimen . Adherence oral cancer agent often less 80 % , may inadequate treat cancer . The aim study refine determine feasibility preliminary efficacy intervention ( entitle `` ADHERE '' ) use motivational interviewing ( MI ) elicit reason adhere brief cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) mechanism goal-oriented systematic patient education ( PE ) promote adherence symptom management among cancer patient prescribed oral agent . Significance : This study target challenge clinical problem among patient life-threatening disease , assist adhere complete cancer treatment , impact symptom , quality life , longevity .

The model assert even well inform highly motivated patient difficulty achieve sustain optimal adherence lack skill require acquire self-manage feel incapable performing behavior . Main Variables : Adherence symptom severity . Methods : This practice-based study conduct use 4-week intervention ( ADHERE ) promote adherence symptom management patient newly prescribe oral agent two phase . Phase 1 use single-subject-design consecutively enrol 5-patients cancer center 4-weeks investigator use iterative process refine ADHERE practice-based setting . Phase 2 use 8-week quasi-experimental sequential design , enrol 60-patients ( 30 intervention &amp; 30 control ) 2-cancer center examine feasibility preliminary efficacy 4-week ADHERE intervention follow-up 4-weeks ass adherence symptom management . Descriptive statistic provide appropriate data collect , 95 % confidence interval provide use exact method outcome variable , : proportion patient enrol participate study among recruit ; proportion ADHERE receive patient four-week time period ; proportion patient report high satisfaction ADHERE . Exploratory analysis efficacy measure weekly proportion pill take compare prescribed . Implications : This study potential transformative impact oral agent adherence develop advanced practice register nurse-led strategy promote adherence among increase number cancer patient receive cancer treatment pill form . This intervention lead standardize care patient newly prescribe oral agent . Results study used inform development R01 application conduct large randomize trial test efficacy innovative intervention .</detailed_description>
