	<criteria>Patients must histologically and/or cytologically confirm nonsquamous , KRAS wildtype unknown , nonsmall cell lung cancer stage IIIB IV , metastatic unresectable standard curative measure exist . All patient must formalin fixed paraffin embed tumour block ( primary metastatic tumour ) available correlative study must provide informed consent release block correlative study . Patients must least one site disease unidimensionally measurable follow : Measurable disease define least one target lesion irradiate progressed radiation accurately measure least one dimension RECIST 1.1 criterion . Chest Xray ≥ 20 mm CT/MRI scan ( slice thickness &lt; 5 mm ) ≥ 10 mm &gt; long diameter Physical exam ( use caliper ) ≥ 10 mm Lymph node CT scan ≥ 15 mm &gt; measure short axis Presence clinically and/or radiologically document disease ( marker positive patient eligible ) . All radiology study must perform within 28 day prior randomization ( within 35 day negative ) . Age ≥ 18 year . ECOG performance status 0 1 Previous Therapy Surgery : Previous major surgery permit provide least 14 day prior patient randomization wound heal occur . Radiation : Prior external beam radiation permit provide minimum 4 week elapse last dose enrollment trial . Chemotherapy systemic therapy : Prior therapy ALK inhibitor permissible . Patients may receive prior MEK inhibitor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( include EGFR inhibitor kind ) . Patients may receive vaccine , immunotherapy agent MEK/tyrosine kinase inhibitor adjuvant set advance metastatic disease . Prior adjuvant platinumbased chemotherapy combine chemoradiotherapy curative intent permissible provide complete least one year prior enrollment . No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy advance / metastatic disease permissible . Laboratory Requirements ( must do within 7 day prior randomization ) Neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Biochemistry : Creatinine Clearance* ≥ 50 ml/min Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( liver metastasis ≤ 5x UNL permissible provide ALP also ≤ 6 x UNL ) * Creatinine clearance measure directly 24 hour urine sampling calculate appropriate formula : Females : GFR = 1.04 x ( 140age ) x weight kg/serum creatinine μmol/L Males : GFR = 1.23 x ( 140age ) x weight kg/serum creatinine μmol/L Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrollment trial document willingness participate Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients randomized trial must treat follow participate centre In accordance CCTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 2 work day patient randomization Patients history untreated malignancy malignancy require therapy within past 2 year No symptomatic brain metastasis spinal cord compression . Patients asymptomatic brain/spinal cord metastasis plan radiation , treat stable steroid ( decrease dose ) anticonvulsant eligible . Patients significant cardiac disease , include : factor increase risk QTc prolongation risk arrhythmic event ( e.g . heart failure , hypokalaemia , congenital long QT syndrome , family history long QT syndrome unexplained sudden death 40 year age ) mean rest correct QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 470 msec uncontrolled hypertension ( BP ≥ 150/95 mmHg despite medical therapy ) acute coronary syndrome within 6 month prior start treatment angina Canadian Cardiovascular Society Grade IIIV ( despite medical therapy ) symptomatic heart failure ( NYHA IIIV ) prior current cardiomyopathy atrial fibrillation ventricular rate &gt; 100 bpm rest severe valvular heart disease Patients cardiac disease , meet exclusion criterion , must baseline LVEF ≥ 50 % . Any evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease , active infection , active bleeding diatheses renal transplant , include patient know hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Patients neuropathy &gt; grade 1 condition preclude treatment standard chemotherapy regimen plan . Consult CCTG patient localised neuropathy patient may eligible . Patients significant gastrointestinal disease unable swallow capsule . Patients potent inhibitor inducer CYP3A4/5 , CYP2C19 CYP1A2 ( must discontinue within 2 week prior randomization 3 week St. John 's Wort ) . Patients agree avoid ingestion large amount grapefruit Seville orange ( product contain fruit , e.g . grapefruit juice marmalade ) take vitamin E supplement multivitamin supplement . Patients require oral anticoagulant ( Coumadin ) eligible provide increased vigilance respect INR monitoring upon initiation dose selumetinib . If medically appropriate treatment available , investigator consider switch patient LMW heparin . Patients current past history central serous retinopathy retinal vein occlusion , high intraocular pressure ( ≥ 21mm ) uncontrolled glaucoma ( irrespective IOP ) . Patients visual symptom undergo ophthalmologic examination prior randomization . Pregnant lactating woman . Women childbearing potential must urine pregnancy test proven negative within 7 day prior randomization . Men woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception Patients agree avoid excessive sun exposure use adequate sunscreen protection . Selumetinibspecific precaution patient Asian ethnicity : Plasma exposure selumetinib ( Cmax AUC ) high , population level , subject Asian descent approximately 1.5 2fold nonJapanese Asians Japanese subject , compare Western subject . However , overlap range exposure experience Asian Western subject high average plasma exposure associate change tolerability profile single dose selumetinib . Investigators make clinical judgment whether potential risk experience high selumetinib plasma exposure potential adverse event outweigh potential benefit treatment selumetinib .</criteria>
