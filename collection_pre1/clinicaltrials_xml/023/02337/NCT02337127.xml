	<brief_summary>Current treatment guideline indicate oral antiviral agent HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B virus infection ( CHB ) stop patient undergone HBeAg seroconversion HBV-DNA loss measure two consecutive occasion least 6 month apart ( primary treatment endpoint ) . Stopping treatment consider undetectable HBV-DNA document three separate occasion 6 month apart HBeAg-negative patient . However , oral antiviral drug currently approve treatment CHB relatively limit sustained long-term efficacy large proportion patient suffer HBV recurrence stop treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lamivudine Extending Therapy Chronic Hepatitis B Patients After 3-year Oral Antiviral Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study : 1 . To evaluate long-term efficacy Lamivudine extend therapy CHB patient receive least 3-year oral antiviral agent . 2 . To evaluate long-term outcome predictive factor Lamivudine extend therapy CHB patient receive least 3-year oral antiviral agent . A prospective , open-label , multicenter study enroll 500 treatment-na√Øve CHB patient receive least 3-year oral antiviral agent . With voluntary decision consultation , 250 patient receive Lamivudine extend therapy 5 year 250 patient receive follow-up serve control . The primary outcome measurement HBV DNA recurrence , whilst secondary outcome measurement liver-related outcome associate predictive factor</detailed_description>
