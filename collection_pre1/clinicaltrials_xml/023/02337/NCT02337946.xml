	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study mFOLFOX6 + Panitumumab Combination Therapy 5-FU/LV + Panitumumab Combination Therapy Patients With Chemotherapy-naïve Unresectable Advanced Recurrent Colorectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label study exploratorily examine efficacy safety 5-FU/LV + panitumumab combination therapy mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy patient chemotherapy-naïve unresectable , advanced/recurrent colorectal carcinoma KRAS wild-type treat 6 cycle [ 2 weeks/cycle ( site visit ) ] first-line mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy The study enroll approximately 100 patient . All patient receive 6 cycle Protocol Treatment [ 1 ] : mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy [ oxaliplatin ( OXA ) : 85 mg/m2/day 1 ; levofolinate calcium ( l-LV ) : 200 mg/m2/day 1 ; bolus 5-FU : 400 mg/m2/day 1 ; infusional 5-FU : 2400 mg/m2/day 1-3 ; panitumumab : 6 mg/kg ] every two week . Then randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one treatment group . - Group A ( 50 Patients ) : mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy , every two week [ oxaliplatin ( OXA ) : 85 mg/m2/day 1 ; levofolinate calcium ( l-LV ) : 200 mg/m2/day 1 ; bolus 5-FU : 400 mg/m2/day 1 ; infusional 5-FU : 2400 mg/m2/day 1-3 ; panitumumab : 6 mg/kg ] - Group B ( 50 patient ) : 5-FU/LV + panitumumab combination therapy , every two week [ levofolinate calcium ( l-LV ) : 200 mg/m2/day 1 ; bolus 5-FU : 400 mg/m2/day 1 ; infusional 5-FU : 2400 mg/m2/day 1-3 ; panitumumab : 6 mg/kg ] This multi-center trial conduct Japan . The overall time participate study approximately 12 month .</detailed_description>
