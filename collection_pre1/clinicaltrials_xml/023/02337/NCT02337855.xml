	<detailed_description>This Phase I , first-in-human study vaccine S. mansoni infection.The study recruit 72 healthy adult male non-pregnant female single clinical center test two formulation Sm-TSP-2 vaccine ( use Alhydrogel® , use Alhydrogel® plus GLA-AF ) , 3 different dos : 10ug , 30ug , 100ug . The study use dose-escalation cohort design , escalation next dose cohort determine base evaluation pre-defined escalation criterion require 7 day safety data examine subject current cohort receive first dose vaccine . For Cohort ( 1-3 ) , initial 5 subject ( 2 Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel® , 2 Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel®/GLA-AF , 1 placebo ) enrol , randomize , vaccinate , complete Visit 2 ( Day 3 ) , enrol rest cohort . As dose-escalation decision , evidence significant reactogenicity require review prior proceeding.Recruitment enrollment study occur ongoing basis , cohort recruit vaccinated sequence . All subject assign investigational vaccine placebo randomization , double-blind design use ( i.e. , neither subject investigator aware study product assign : Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel® , Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel®/GLA-AF , placebo ) . Each subject receive 3 vaccination Days 1 , 57 , 113 , follow total 12 month third dose . The study duration approximately 24 month , subject participation duration approximately 16 month . The primary objective ass safety reactogenicity ascend dos Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel® ( 10ug , 30ug , 100ug ) without GLA-AF vaccine give three dos administer Days 1 , 57 , 113 . The secondary objective include : ( 1 ) ass IgG antibody response use indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) Day 127 ; ( 2 ) ass IgG antibody response use indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) 14 day dose one two Day 203 293 ( 3 6 month third dose ) Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel® ( 10ug , 30ug , 100ug ) without GLA-AF ; ( 3 ) To assess duration IgG antibody response use indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) follow receipt three dose Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel® ( 10ug , 30ug , 100ug ) without GLA-AF .</detailed_description>
