	<detailed_description>Inhibitors PI3 kinase pathway demonstrated preclinical activity neuroblastoma . This activity may derive part destabilize Mycn protein , impede tumor angiogenesis , and/or effect . SF1126 novel inhibitor PI3 kinase mTOR include active moiety ( consist LY294002 ) link RGDS tetrapeptide target active agent integrin express tissue . In preclinical study , SF1126 result mark concentration LY294002 tumor . In adult phase 1 trial , maximum tolerate dose SF1126 identify dos 1110 mg/m2 administer intravenously twice weekly continuous schedule . In first pediatric phase 1 trial SF1126 , dose escalation follow 3+3 dose escalation design . Once recommended phase 2 pediatric dose identify , expansion cohort 10 patient tumor MYCN amplification , Mycn expression , Myc expression treat . All patient participate mandatory pharmacokinetic testing . Additional optional correlative study evaluate potential predictive marker potential pharmacodynamic marker , include PTEN PIK3CA aberration , Myc / Mycn expression , Myc / pS6 level peripheral blood mononuclear cell .</detailed_description>
