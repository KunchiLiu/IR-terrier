	<brief_summary>This double‐blind randomize clinical trial . Both patient podiatrist evaluate monitor study patient blind electrical stimulation application . The manufacturer unit ask inform patient receive unit . Each unit cod unique identification number , manufacturer unit reveal status , placebo electric stimulation , end data collection last patient . Subsequently , investigator could match status identification number correspond unit start analyze data . Patients receive activated electrical stimulation unit receive standard dose 50 volt describe . The investigator enroll cohort 80 diabetes ( type II ) patient peripheral neuropathy ( see section 6 sample size justification ) . The diagnosis diabetes mellitus base World Health Organization criterion . ( World‐Health‐Organization 1999 ) . The inclusion exclusion criterion describe table III . The clinical assessment describe table IV . The investigator discus study design , duration , risk potential subject ask participate . The participant provide consent form read leisure . The investigator available answer question provide explanation request potential participant family .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There total five study visit require patient . There one schedule visit baseline evaluation four additional visit 2 week , 4 week , 6 week treatment 8 week ( 2 week post stop treatment ) . The baseline visit involve completion standardize intake form , include pertinent demographic age , height , weight , education level , occupation , comorbidities study patient ( see Table IV ) . Several clinical assessment perform baseline well study visit evaluate severity neuropathy skin perfusion describe table IV . Clinical Assessments Baseline Medical History : This include : duration type diabetes , type diabetes medication ( insulin , oral , combination therapy , diet ) , previous history foot ulcer , previous history fall , amputation ( toe , foot ) , low extremity bypass , low extremity angioplasty , Coronary artery bypass surgery , cardiac angioplasty , arthritis , liver disease , osteoporosis , malignancy , bone tumor . The Kaplan co‐morbidity index use record disease severity . The New York Heart Association criterion use classify congestive heart failure , National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines chronic kidney disease stage kidney disease . Research staff document prescription over‐the‐counter medication . Research staff measure height weight determine body mass index ( BMI ) . Baseline Social Factors : Marital status , year education , type work , tobacco history ( pack year , current smoker , current use chewing tobacco , previous smoker , tobacco history ) , drug history ( current , previous history , drug history ) , education , occupation , alcohol history assess . Screening Test frailty assessment : Fried Frailty Criteria : Weight loss &gt; 10 pound precede year ; Grip strength ; Low level physical activity ; 15 foot walk time ; Exhaustion [ 13 ] Screening cognitive problem : MMSE score [ 15 ] Foot questionnaire foot exam Baseline &amp; 2‐ week follow‐up ( week 2 , week 4 , week 6 , week 8 ) : Peripheral Neuropathy : Research staff evaluate Vibration Perception Threshold ( VPT ) Testing evaluate large fiber neuropathy Semmes‐Weinstein monofilaments , Modified Neuropathy Disability Score . ( Armstrong Lawrence 1998 ) do . Research staff ass light touch pressure sensation nine site foot use 4 , 10 , 26 , 60 Semmes‐Weinstein gram monofilaments . ( Diamond , Mueller et al . 1989 ) The Modified Neuropathy Disability Score score clinical examination include Achilles deep tendon reflex , pressure , vibration sensation temperature sensation foot . Pain : Visual Analogue Scale Gait test : 8 sensor attach leg low back use comfortable strap ask walk 20 meter flat surface , two time . A third 20 meter walk perform additional distractive cognitive task ( count -1 ) . The 4th test fast walking . Walking performance ( e.g. , speed , cadence , stability ) spatio-temporal parameter gait ( e.g. , velocity , stride time , gait inter-cycle variability , double support , gait initiation ) measure . Balance test : The BalanSensTM kinematic sensor attach leg low back used measure variation subject 's center mass measure Romberg protocol include double stance , semi-tandem , full-tandem test . Patients ask stand straight , foot together , hand cross 30 second , 20 second , 15 second respectively double stance test , semi-tendem , full tandem test eye open close . Baseline 6 week follow-up Activity Monitoring : Spontaneous daily physical activity monitor home environment 2 day use PAMSysTM Removal log : participant ask note time , time , reason removal PAMSysTM remove 2 day collection period . Quality life questionnaire : SF12 Other assessment Fall log : participant receive log agree call study overseer event fall 4 week study period . Other patient information : available patient record include medical history , neurological exam result , physical examination may gather patient record authorization subject ( see form T504a ) . In addition , subject photograph video experiment may take subject 's authorization .</detailed_description>
