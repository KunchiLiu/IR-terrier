Current medication schizophrenia generally improve cognition , major contribution disability remain undertreated . Computerized cognitive remediation program , produce activity-dependent recruitment neural resource specifically enhance under-functioning brain system , effective improve cognition community function patient schizophrenia , effect still modest . Our preliminary work suggest training associate improvement visual memory , though visual memory cognitive area refractory cognitive training .
