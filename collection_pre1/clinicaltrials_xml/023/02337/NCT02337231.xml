	<detailed_description>The study randomize , control , cross-over clinical trial borage oil soybean oil determine whether metabolism and/or impact MC-PUFAs botanical oil supplement change relationship specific genotype SNP ( rs174537 ) strongly associate FADS1 activity PUFA metabolism . Subjects previously genotyped rs174537 give supplement blood PUFA ( serum erythrocyte membrane ) , urinary eicosanoids eicosanoid release whole blood ( leukocyte generation ) measure biochemical determinant genotype impact supplement metabolism . To evaluate effect genotype rs174537 locus metabolism MC-PUFAs borage soybean oil long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LC-PUFAs ) , include arachidonic acid , investigator utilize double blind , randomize , crossover design . There three study group base genotype healthy volunteer rs174537 . Individuals within genotype consent screen 8 week prior randomization start intervention . Subjects randomize begin 4 week either borage oil soybean oil follow 8 week washout period , another 4 week period take second oil . Study visit occur 0 , 2 , 4 week oil supplementation period , addition consent visit , total 7 visit study .</detailed_description>
