	<detailed_description>Voluntary Medical Male circumcision ( VMMC ) effective strategy reduce risk HIV acquisition heterosexual men . Observational data randomize control trail ( RCTs ) conduct Africa ( 1,2,3 ) suggest procedure reduces risk HIV acquisition 50-76 % heterosexual male . VMMC also show reduce incidence sexually transmit infection ( STI ) , include herpes simplex virus type 2 ( HSV-2 ) human papilloma virus ( HPV ) men ( 4 ) , Chlamydia ( 5 ) , trichomonas vaginalis ( TV ) , bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) HPV female partner ( 6 ) . The result RCT 's generate increased demand safe affordable MC service area moderate-to-high HIV prevalence MC rate low . Latin America region circumcision male uncommon ( 7 ) . In Dominican Republic ( DR ) , focus study , 2007 nationwide household survey find 13.7 % men age 15-59 circumcise ( 8 ) . AIDS lead cause death Caribbean basin among adult age 15-44 year . There approximately 240,000 people currently live disease , reside Dominican Republic ( DR ) Haiti ( 9 ) . The prevalence HIV infection DR approximately 0.8 % nationwide ( 8 ) high select high-risk population , among people live `` bateyes '' , small town surround sugar cane plantation , prevalence 3.2 % ( 10 ) . In pregnant woman seek prenatal care main hospital Altagracia province HIV seroprevalence 4.5 % ( 11 ) . One area high prevalence ( 1.2 % ) country Region V health , include province La Altagracia , El Seibo , Hato Mayor , La Romana San Pedro de Macor√≠s . Prevalence also high urban slum capital city , Santo Domingo . The public health impact introduce MC strategy prevent HIV/STI transmission area high HIV/STI prevalence low MC rate significant . In addition decrease rate HIV STI , intervention could indirectly help decrease rate HPV associate cervical cancer . The study propose develop , implement , monitor evaluate pilot MC service select site assess acceptability , uptake , safety demand service , use data develop , collaboration Dominican Ministry Health ( MoH ) , proposal National Institute Mental Health ( NIMH ) support operation research concern safety , uptake , efficacy MC intervention DR. 1 . Specific Aims : Based result numerous observational study three RCTs World Health Organization ( WHO ) Joint United Nations Programme HIV/AIDS ( UNAIDS ) endorse VMMC biomedical intervention HIV prevention . As , country high prevalence HIV population encourage examine feasibility offering MC service part portfolio HIV prevention strategy national level . The specific aim project : 1 . To develop culturally appropriate education material benefit VMMC client attend pilot healthcare center . 2 . To train core group provider proper surgical counseling technique provide comprehensive VMMC service . 3 . To determine acceptability , uptake demand MC service key area high HIV prevalence . H1 : The acceptability uptake among high risk men around 60 % . 4 . To assess safety adverse event perform circumcision resource constrain setting . H2 : VMMC result complication rate le 2 % . 5 . To assess sexual risk behavior , perception sexual function sexual pleasure men VMMC . H3 : difference risk behavior , sexual function pleasure VMMC . 6 . Estimate point prevalence common STI subset circumcise men preserve small sample blood test future scientific hypothesis and/or newer test technique become available . 7 . To build collaboration MoH partner DR UIC develop proposal NIMH operational research context large scale MC service provision . 2 . Background significance : b.1 . Male Circumcision Prevent HIV Transmission Male circumcision perhaps one old surgical procedure perform human . The millenary practice remove male foreskin cultural , religious medical dimension widely study . Around world , procedure mostly perform religious reason person Jewish Muslim faith . Medical indication MC include phimosis , paraphimosis balanitis , among others ( 12 ) . Early evidence relationship MC HIV infection come number small , mostly observational study , do Africa ( 13 ) . These historical data validate completion three large RCTs South Africa , Kenya Uganda , show overall decrease 50-76 % risk acquire HIV infection circumcise male compare control ( 1,2,3 ) . The pathogenesis initial infection level foreskin involve tissue macrophage , cell receptor moist , poorly keratinize inner prepuce . The first cellular target HIV virion human genitalia tissue dendritic cell lamina propria submucosa ( 14 ) . These cell express surface CD4 receptor CCR5 co-receptors HIV high affinity . In intact human skin , dendritic cell shield outer environment relatively thick layer keratin cover surface epithelium . Tissue study human foreskin show inner lining prepuce , expose penile erection , thin keratin layer susceptible microscopic abrasion expose tissue macrophage make vulnerable infection HIV ( 15 ) . b.2 . MC STI prevention : MC effective strategy decrease risk infection HIV STI heterosexual male . A beneficial effect also observe decrease risk STI female . The RCTs confirm VMMC decrease herpes simplex virus type 2 ( HSV-2 ) acquisition 29 % , HPV prevalence 34 % men ( 4 ) . Among female partner circumcise men , bacterial vaginosis reduce 40 % , trichomonas vaginalis infection reduce 48 % ( 6 ) . Genital ulcer disease also reduce among male female partner approximately half ( 16 ) . b.3 . HIV Caribbean Dominican Republic : The significant decrease rate HIV acquisition observe among circumcised male participate African RCT generating increase demand safe affordable VMMC service area high HIV prevalence procedure routinely perform . Latin America one area routine circumcision male uncommon ( 7 ) . In Dominican Republic , 13.7 % men age 15-59 year circumcise ( 8 ) . The Caribbean region world high HIV prevalence outside sub-Saharan Africa ( 1.0 % ) ( 9 ) . Approximately 240,000 individual currently live disease . Among Caribbean country , Dominican Republic Haiti report high prevalence region . According data recent In DR , prevalence HIV infection 0.8 % nationwide ( 8 ) , however , number higher select population certain geographic location . The Dominican healthcare system administratively divide 9 region , include country 's 31 province . Region 0 health include National District province Santo Domingo Monte Plata . The city Santo Domingo capital financial center DR . It estimate population 2.7 million people spread area 1,400 KM2 . 90 % population live urban set province ( 17 ) . The overall prevalence HIV around 0.7 % entire region higher vulnerable group commercial sex worker ( CSW ) ( 3.3 % ) , Men Have Sex Men ( MSM ) ( 5.9 % ) drug user ( 7.1 % ) ( 18 ) . Regions V VII report high prevalence HIV country , 1.2 % 1.5 % respectively ( 8 ) . Specific population within province rate HIV considerably high national average . For instance , prevalence 3.2 % bateyes , small community surround sugar cane plantation , mixed population Dominicans Haitian migrant worker cohabitate . Our team conduct preliminary study Altagracia Province , part Region V , since report high province-specific HIV rate low circumcision rate country . A survey pregnant woman seek prenatal care main hospital province find HIV seroprevalence 4.5 % 11 . The prevalence HIV 5.2 % CSW , 7.6 % MSM 8.5 % among drug user ( 18 ) . c ) Preliminary study : The parent study project RCT VMMC reduce HIV incidence Kisumu , Kenya whose principal investigator Prof. Robert C. Bailey , co-investigator current proposal ( 3 ) . The main objective trial ass effectiveness VMMC reduce HIV incidence young , sexually active men . The protective effect find intent-to-treat analysis 53 % treat analysis adjust cross-overs men find HIV seropositive baseline estimate protective effect 60 % . Adverse event related surgical procedure , 1.5 % . Behavioral disinhibition ( risk compensation ) part circumcise men small significant . Drs . Brito Bailey conduct feasibility study healthcare facility Altagracia province Dominican Republic June July 2007 . A total 37 healthcare facility survey . The study find facility lack appropriate equipment perform surgical procedure four ( 11 % ) surgical theater . 43 healthcare worker , majority physician ( 91 % ) , interview study . Only 23 % personnel experience perform MC significant number provider ( 76 % ) believe need comprehensive training procedure prior start MC program . Quantitative qualitative study assess acceptability MC among men , woman provider Altagracia Province conduct 2008 . In study , 73 % men think MC improve hygiene approximately one third know reduces risk penile cancer STI . Only small percentage ( 21 % ) know MC help prevent HIV infection . When first ask , 29 % participant report would willing circumcised procedure offer . However , educational session detail benefit procedure HIV STI prevention , acceptability increase 67 % . Such increment also observe previous study do Botswana ( 19 ) Thailand ( 20 ) acceptability increase 61 % 81 % 14 % 66 % , respectively , similar information session . In multivariate analysis , strong predictor men 's acceptability circumcision , information session , Haitian nationality ( OR=1.86 , 95 % CI 1.01-3.41 ) , think circumcision improve hygiene ( OR=2.78 , 95 % CI 1.29-6.0 ) believe circumcision decrease sexual pleasure ( OR=2.18 , 95 % CI 1.20-3.94 ) . These result publish ( 21 , 22 ) . We also conduct 13 focus group discussion ( FGD ) , 6 woman 7 men , consist 6-10 participant ( mean=7.9 , SD=1.3 ) . One additional FGD conduct six physician , two male four female , work rural clinic around province . Findings qualitative study show significant number participant might willing circumcise , agree circumcision partner , improve hygiene , prevent disease treat medical condition , phimosis , result pain intercourse . These result consistent quantitative study men 's acceptability MC . Perhaps one important finding FGD enthusiastic endorsement MC woman , fact potential implication successful implementation circumcision program country ( 22 ) . Overall , preliminary data suggest men willing circumcise provide receive information benefit procedure . Before recommend introduction VMMC service part comprehensive package HIV STI prevention strategy , finding need confirm study uptake VMMC among sexually active men select clinic serve client high prevalence area . In addition , need identify potential barrier offer MC service high risk community prior propose implement large-scale intervention . In order properly address concern , conduct pilot study provide necessary preliminary data design proposal NIMH conduct operational research around large-scale implementation project . ) Experimental design method : d.1 . Pilot study design The study conduct two site : STI clinic Instituto Dermatologico Cirugia de Piel ( IDCP ) Santo Domingo Cl√≠nica de Familia La Romana , Dominican Republic . These site select basis : 1 ) high number male client risk HIV STI infection community serve clinic ; 2 ) high level acceptability MC among men community serve clinic ( bateyes Altagracia ) ; 3 ) availability service provider willing train ; 4 ) availability equipment ; 5 ) availability infrastructure , include minor surgical theater , sterilization facility HIV voluntary counseling testing ( VCT ) STI management . During first phase study , culturally appropriate educational material create Spanish principal investigator local collaborator . Focus Group Discussions ( FGD ) in-depth interview conduct member community learn educational need community ass opinion best deliver information MC contain educational material . We plan conduct FGD community serve Instituto Dermatologico Clinica de Familia , two main study site . The plan assemble group 6-12 participant population live community . Community leader , health promoter , teacher primary care physician ask help identify invite volunteer respective community participate study . There difference recruitment process men woman . They recruit venue ( school , club , community center ) . Participants invited participate research personnel help local leader . These local leader may genders help recruit participant either gender . The focus group gender-specific . The moderator explain purpose study participant .

After informed consent sign , `` Locator Information Form '' contain confidential data subject 's name address complete . Only select research staff access information , file separate rest study form . A de-identified `` demographic information form behavioral questionnaire '' complete next . Testing HIV infection carry use rapid test . The test kit use synthetic peptide test , Determine HIV 1/2 , recombinant antigen test Unigold HIV 1/2 Recombinant . Results provide client , appropriate counseling , visit . Participants teach observe , read interpret test company counselor . Men positive result inform HIV status followed-up study clinic refer confirmatory HIV-ELISA , confirm , HIV treatment . Serologic test HSV-2 , hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBV ) , hepatitis C antibody ( HCV ) perform use ELISA test . A serum Rapid Plasma Reagin test ( RPR ) perform test syphilis . Chlamydia gonorrhea test perform urine use Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) assay . All participant test positive Chlamydia , syphilis gonorrhea offer treatment free charge . Participants test positive HSV-2 active genital lesion offer treatment free charge . Those test positive active lesion counsel safe sex practice risk transmission partner recommend treatment asymptomatic individual infect HSV-2 . HIV , HBV , HCV positive participant refer evaluation treatment Clinica de la Familia La Romana chronic disease require long term treatment usually covered government program . If participant find treatable STD return site , call study investigator use phone number provide participant enrolment ensure treatment provide . If temporary , medically curable condition present , would advisable defer potential surgery , participant treat asked return re-evaluation study eligibility cure . Men find STD HIV-positive refer immediate care . Once enrollment complete , participant give appointment surgery . Circumcision perform soon informed consent , preferably within day . All surgery do local anesthesia clinic train clinician , use standardize forceps-guided method describe Krieger colleague contain WHO MC manual ( 23 ) . Circumcised men counsel refrain sex six week post-surgery counsel risk HIV infection open wound heal process . They check complication ask sexual activity seven day procedure . Men without complication follow six month surgery behavioral risk assessment , HIV test counsel . Men may come study site unscheduled visit time 6 month follow-up . All men counsel enrollment follow-up visit reduce risk HIV infection consistent condom use , applicable , reduction number sex partner . Counselling condom use sexual risk reduction provide trained , experienced , native-speaking counsellor . MC service offer select two site 1 year . The estimated cost per circumcision $ 40 . We expect recruit five client per week site total convenience sample 575 subject one year . During second year project , continue assess behavioral risk factor first six month work analyze data last semester project . Circumcision Procedure Prior surgery , clinician obtain complete medical history perform physical exam . A brief description procedure follow . The patient lie back comfortable position . The pubic area shave clean disposable razor hair pick dressing tape . The surgeon scrub put 2 pair sterile glove . The client 's skin prepare Betadine solution , make sure inner surface prepuce glans clean skin dry . The outer pair gloves remove . The client drape two drape center `` O '' towel , , use 2 % lidocaine without epinephrine , dorsal nerve block field block special attention ventral nerve , perform . Normally , 10ml 2 % lidocaine use . The anesthetic effect nerve block check , revise necessary . The prepuce hold two mosquito forceps , one lateral aspect , curve mark make sterile disposable marking pen , outline plan surgical cut .
