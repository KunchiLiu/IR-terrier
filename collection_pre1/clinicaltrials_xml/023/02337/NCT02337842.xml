	<detailed_description>This phase I , double blind , placebo-controlled safety infectivity study experimental human Norovirus genogroup GII.4 administer healthy adult 18-49 year age . The unblinded pharmacist assign treatment . Subjects admit inpatient nursing unit , challenge live GII.4 Norovirus strain oral administration , remain unit least 4 day follow challenge follow post-challenge safety efficacy multiple clinical assessment collection blood stool specimen . Subjects susceptible human norovirus GII.4 challenge strain , CIN-1 ( i.e . presence functional FUT-2 gene ) , regardless ABO blood type , house Cincinnati Center Clinical Research ( CCCR ) inpatient facility challenge orally different dos virus . The challenge study conduct 2-3 cohort approximately 20 subject , initial cohort receive 103 RT-PCR unit placebo ( 9 `` challenge '' 1 `` placebo '' per 10 subject ) . Based illness rate acute gastroenteritis ( AGE ) initial cohort , second cohort enrol receive challenge dose base result previous study . Additional cohort may necessary . Illness define infection accompany vomit and/or diarrhea inpatient stay.Two three additional subject per cohort serve alternate event study subject unavailable become ineligible time inpatient study.Subjects remain inpatient facility least four day follow challenge assess daily clinical virologic evidence norovirus infection . Subjects return investigational site evaluation Day 6 ( 6-8 day ) 15 ( 14-16 day ) 30 day ( 28-35 day ) , 45 ( 40-45 day ) , ( 55-65 ) post challenge . The primary objective evaluate safety reactogenicity norovirus GII.4 ( CIN-1 ; 031693 ) challenge stock determine safe optimal challenge dose Norovirus GII.4 Challenge Stock norovirus achieve illness &gt; /=50 % subject . Illness define : diarrhea ( &gt; 3 loose liquid stool &gt; 300 gm loose liquid stool /24h ) , and/or vomit inpatient period , participant evidence infection . The secondary objective determine rate infection study participant ; virus detection stool Norovirus GII.4 Challenge Stock-specific qRT-PCR anti- Norovirus GII.4 Challenge Stock serum IgG ELISA ( &gt; /=4 fold rise baseline Day 30 ) , determine quantity duration virus shed stool qRT-PCR , conduct Time-to-event analysis estimate median time cessation shed use Kaplan-Meier method , determine modify Vesikari score measure gastroenteritis severity , determine Norovirus GII.4 Challenge Stock-specific immunoglobulin titer ELISA challenge ; Serum IgA IgG , Serum Blockade IgG , Salivary IgA , determine effect preexist Norovirus GII.4 Challenge Stock-specific Immunoglobulin serum saliva rate infection , determine total Norovirus GII.4 Challenge Stock-specific IgA- IgG-Secreting Cells circulation ELISpot assay .</detailed_description>
