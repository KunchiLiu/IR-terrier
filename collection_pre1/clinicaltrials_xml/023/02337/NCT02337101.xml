	<brief_summary>Background : Five - 15 % patient concussion continue experience impair physical , cognitive emotional symptom longer 3 month post-injury . Currently , standardise treatment available patient persistent post-concussional symptom ( PCS ) systematic treatment study remain limited . Aim : 1. develop early intervention programme base principle cognitive-behavioural therapy grade exercise young patient PCS last 3 month , 2. evaluate efficacy intervention PCS randomise , control trial . Methods : Patients age 15 - 30 year diagnose concussion hospital Central Denmark Region screen persistent symptom two month post-injury . Those impair symptom invite participate randomise controlled trial compare early intervention programme enhance usual care . We expect include 120 patient 2015-2016 . Treatment interdisciplinary begin approximately 3 - 5 month concussion . All patient complete self-report measure baseline 3 , 6 15 month randomisation . The primary outcome severity PCS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Concussion important public health concern . Debilitating persistent post-concussional symptom associate considerable long-term sickness markedly reduce health-related quality life industrialized country . In Denmark , approximately 25000 people diagnose concussion year . Although complete resolution typical post-concussional symptom headache , dizziness fatigue normally occur within first day week concussion , significant proportion correspond five to15 % patient continue experience symptom longer 3 month post-injury . These patient risk long-term sickness , reduce health-related quality life well permanently reduce work ability , particularly disastrous adolescent young adult . Currently , standardise treatment available patient persistent post-concussional symptom . The aetiology persistent post-concussional symptom partly elicit , consensus exist whether post-concussional symptom constitute true syndrome link neurobiological disturbance cause accident head trauma . Nevertheless , term post-concussional syndrome widely use describe set persistent somatic emotional symptom often observe concussed individual . We use abbreviation 'PCS ' purely descriptive term post-concussional symptom . The literature suggest , PCS best understood complex , multifactorial model , biological psychological factor contribute persistent symptom associate disability . Moreover , PCS overlap considerably symptoms trauma-related condition whiplash-associated disorder post-traumatic stress disorder . On background , number trial test effect various psychosocial intervention , include cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) , persistent PCS . Although preliminary , promising evidence treatment base cognitive-behavioural model may effective treat PCS prevent permanent suffer disability . Some cognitive - behavioural mechanism find play important role maintenance PCS unhelpful illness perception , maladaptive cop strategy all-or-nothing behaviour . The all-or-nothing behaviour refers behavioural response , patient overdo thing believe symptom abate spend prolong period recover symptom reappear . Other patient report gradual restriction activity time , fear worsening symptom . A promising avenue treatment seem focus make sustainable , gradual increase level activity ( intensity / duration ) time , avoid extreme oscillation . This often refer Graded Exercise Therapy ( GET ) , treatment effectively reduce impairment suffer chronic fatigue persistent pain provide physiotherapist hence deliver primary care municipality set . Currently , systematic study psychosocial intervention patient persistent PCS remain limited . A recent review conclude rigorous , large-scale randomise control trial ( RCT ) evaluate effectiveness CBT persistent PCS need . Aim : 1. develop early intervention programme base CBT GET principle young patient age 15 - 30 year PCS last three month , 2. evaluate efficacy intervention programme PCS RCT . Hypotheses Primary hypothesis Patients early intervention group 6 month randomisation report statistically clinically significantly great reduction post-concussional symptom compare patient receive enhance usual care . Secondary hypothesis 1 . Patients early intervention group 6 month randomisation report statistically clinically significantly high health relate quality life overall daily functioning compare patient receive enhance usual care . 2 . Patients early intervention group 12 month treatment less consumption health care ( base register-data ) less illness-related absence school work ( base self-reported data ) compare patient , receive enhance usual care .</detailed_description>
