	<brief_title>Recovery Enhancement From Traumatic Brain Injury Using Acceptance Commitment Therapy - Pilot Study .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A pilot study design initially assess feasibility acceptability ACT study protocol client group order inform future clinical trial . The methodology involve quantitative qualitative method involve inpatient Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust ( BIRT ) unit , staff involve day day care inpatient clinicians involved administration therapy . Quantitative method ( questionnaire ) choose assess possible change assessment measure . The measure choose previously use . They good validity ( ability answer question ask ) reliability , therefore practically suitable measure outcomes therapy . Qualitative method ( focus group ) also choose , owe pilot nature research , order obtain personal opinion acceptability intervention treatment protocol , participate . The intervention administer , alongside TAU , inpatient BIRT centre Glasgow compare comparison group receive TAU ( base BIRT centre either York and/or Leeds ) . The rational choosing BIRT centre Glasgow intervention group one convenience researcher involve study base Glasgow . This help facilitate data collection reduce cost . Given BIRT centre adhere similar philosophy care rehabilitation service user profile relatively similar , believe recruiting elsewhere purpose comparison would appropriate . Recruiting treatment comparison group separate centre also ensure client receive TAU learn ACT strategies accidentally discussion peer staff . If happen indication change could attribute difference treatment provide . Five participant group recruit : - client inpatient setting ( treatment group ) , - client inpatient setting ( comparison group ) , - care staff work directly client ( treatment group ) , - care staff work directly client ( comparison group ) - psychology staff involve administer intervention .

All recruitment , exception psychology staff convenient sample , conducted staff member involve direct write study . Further outcome measure focus group conduct researcher involve provision treatment . Psychology staff intervention centre complete training ACT inform study . If choose participate recruit client BIRT Glasgow , complete record form identify inclusion exclusion criterion meet . This form allow staff outline barrier difficulty encounter part process . Information sheet provide recruited client , addition care staff work . The study also explain head service comparison site , provide integrate protocol .

Further research task complete staff : Any observation part apply study protocol also document . For example , participant flow , drop rate , administration questionnaire , storage material ethical issue comment upon per objective overall pilot study . Guidelines report Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) pilot part study . In order establish base rate group , record keep SAE experience participant intervention comparison group . A checklist potential SAEs use time test treatment control group order establish whether SAEs occur .</detailed_description>
