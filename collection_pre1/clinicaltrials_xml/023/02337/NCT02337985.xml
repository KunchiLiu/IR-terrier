	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study gene therapy follow combination chemotherapy treat patient acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) -related non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Placing gene show laboratory inhibit growth spread immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) patient 's peripheral blood stem cell may improve body 's ability fight HIV . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving gene therapy combination chemotherapy may improve body 's ability fight HIV AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To demonstrate safety feasibility rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-treated hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ( HSPC ) ( lentivirus vector rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-transduced hematopoietic progenitor cell ) transplantation AIDS patient complete treatment non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect HIV infection presence gene-marked blood cell measure woodchuck post-transcriptional regulatory element ( WPRE ) deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) perform , , ATI . II . To demonstrate engraftment gene-modified progeny cell follow treatment . III . To determine selection gene-modified progeny cell occur analytical treatment interruption ( ATI ) combination anti-retroviral therapy ( cART ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive prednisone orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-5 ; rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 ; etoposide , doxorubicin hydrochloride vincristine sulfate IV 96 hour day 1-4 ; cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute day 5 . Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) daily ( QD ) begin day 6 continue absolute neutrophil count recovers . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive lentivirus vector rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-transduced hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell IV day 0 ( 48 hour final combination chemotherapy course ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 month , every 6 month 3 year , annually 10 year .</detailed_description>
