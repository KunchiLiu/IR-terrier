	<brief_title>Management Acute Preterm Labor : Nifedipen Alone Combined With Cildenafil Citrate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women randomly assign two study group use computerized random number table generator order get trial sequence hidden seal numbered opaque envelope . Each envelope contain single element ( assignment ) trial sequence . The statistician generated random allocation sequence , investigator enrol participant . Each patient undergo ultrasound examination prior randomization confirm GA , rule major fetal anomaly determine cervical measurement . Dexamethasone total dose 24 mg administer patient give previous admission . Eligible woman randomly assign two study group : Group I : ( combine nifedipine sildenafil citrate ) The protocol nifedipen unit consist 20 mg orally stat , follow 10 mg orally every 6-8 hour , time sildenafil citrate administer vaginally dose 25mg 8 hourly interval medication continue 48-72 hour indicate . Group II : ( nifedipine alone ) receive therapy nifedipine alone regimen duration describe . During therapy , maternal ( pulse rate , blood pressure , uterine contraction ) , well fetal ( heart rate ) monitoring perform every 15-30 minute first 4 hour follow start therapy every 2 hour rest treatment period . Patients whose contraction stop 48-72 hour observe additional 24 hour detect contraction appear remain stable , discharge ask come follow-up 1 week . As stated previous work ( 13 ) vaginal progesterone effective preventing recurrent PTL , thus discharge patient advise continue progesterone till complete 36 week ' gestation . In addition progesterone treatment , patient instruct undergo period bed rest , also educate symptom PTL . The provided antenatal care 2-weekly interval till delivery . At time preterm contraction appear re-admission repeat treatment use drug use . At delivery , data regard time labor onset , along maternal neonatal complication , document .</detailed_description>
