	<brief_title>Evaluation Distortion Correction Data Collection ( DCDC ) App Software</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study phase 1 clinical trial evaluate efficacy Distortion Correction Data Collection ( DCDC ) App computer tablet system . There two objective study . The primary objective evaluate functionality visual distortion app tablet computer . Patients draw distortion tablet screen , app record correct distortions.The second objective create distortion data repository ( DDR ) contain retinal map , data pertain anatomical functional aspect patient retinas distortion . This DDR use correlate retinal health distortions.The correlation key improve correction software app . Long term , app use create diagnostic tool improve image process retinal prosthesis system . Participating subject must least 55 year age old age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . After consent , chart review perform . At baseline visit , subject electroretinogram ( ERG ) . At single study visit , schedule within 2 week baseline visit , subject use DCDC app tablet computer trace visual distortion Amsler grid . Up 5 subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol . The duration study 2 hour baseline visit 1 hour study visit , within 2 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>55 year age great Diagnosed agerelated macular degeneration ( AMD ) . Best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) ( 20/40 20/200 Snellen equivalent ) . Visual distortion present least one eye , determine Amsler grid evaluation . Have follow imaging test complete within past three month part standard care : optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , scan laser ophthalmoscopy ( SLO ) , Fluorescein angiography ( FA ) . Capable understanding requirement study , willing follow study instruction , able provide write informed consent participate , willing comply study requirement . Women postmenopausal otherwise childbearing potential Visual field loss diseases AMD . Visual distortion follow condition AMD : epiretinal membrane , diabetic macular edema , central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO ) edema , cystoid macular edema . A medical condition , serious concurrent illness , extenuate circumstance would significantly decrease ability follow study instruction .</criteria>
