	<detailed_description>Study Population Experimental Design The study design randomize , prospective , split-mouth , control clinical trial . It conduct accordance guideline World Medical Association Declaration Helsinki ( version VI , 2002 ) , approval study design consent Faculty Medicine , Ethical Committee Medical Research , Federal Fluminense University ( Approval protocol CEP-HUAM/CCM 21/03 ) . Written inform consent obtain subject . Systemically healthy patient moderate advance chronic periodontitis refer Department Periodontology , Faculty Dentistry , Federal Fluminense University periodontal treatment advance periodontitis recruit treat study . Inclusion criterion study : ( ) adult subject chronic periodontitis presenting ( b ) radiographic evidence alveolar bone loss proximal aspect tooth , ( c ) intrabony defect deep 4mm , ( ) probe pocket depth &gt; 6 mm site , ( e ) unremarkable general health accord medical history clinical judgment , ( f ) medication take least six month antibiotic take twelve month begin study . Subjects quit habit smoke least one year beginning study consider non-smokers , include criterion meet , include present sample . Exclusion criterion study : ( ) subject `` early onset '' aggressive form periodontitis , ( b ) current smoker , ( c ) presence significant systemic disease ( i.e. , cancer , AIDS , diabetes ) , ( ) clinical evidence furcation defect , ( e ) presence apical radioleucency ( f ) previous lack cooperation maintenance program . Two defect select patient , randomly assign , immediately surgical appointment , computer generate random sequence allocation one two treatment modality employ : ( ) Control : open instrumentation root surface bone defect via flap modify papilla preservation flap ; ( b ) Test : open instrumentation root surface bone defect via flap modify papilla preservation flap application rhFGF-2/HA intrabony defect . Treatment allocation register allocation table sheet unavailable clinical examiner throughout study . Both control test site treat surgical appointment information treatment allocation provide patient . All surgical procedure perform single operator , become aware site allocation complete root planning conditioning , immediately application growth factor test site . A strict surgical protocol emphasize careful hard- soft-tissue management , root debridement , wound stability infection control employ ( Santana et al 2009 ; Miranda et al 2013 ) . Nonsurgical infection control perform context cause- related periodontal therapy consist oral hygiene instruction , scale root planing , tooth polish plaque control measure perform six month prior regenerative surgery . Patients re-evaluated three six month completion non-surgical cause-related periodontal therapy enrol follow late evaluation appointment . Clinical Recordings Clinical parameter assess use cemento-enamel junction ( CEJ ) , applicable , another define landmark , fix reference point . All measurement record use UNC # 15 periodontal probe ( PCP-UNC 15 , Hu-Friedy , Chicago , IL , USA ) blind , train calibrated examiner ( CMMS ) , unaware treatment provide baseline one year treatment . Measurements record near mm . Full mouth plaque score ( FMPS ) record dichotomously percentage total surface ( four site per tooth ) ( O'Leary et al . 1972 ) . BOP also assess dichotomously site , full mouth bleed score calculate . Recession ( REC ) measure distance CEJ gingival margin ( GM ) . Probing depth ( PD ) measure distance GM bottom gingival sulcus . PD REC use calculate vertical clinical attachment level ( PAL ) . Under local anesthesia , transgingival probe perform distance CEJ bottom defect ( distance CEJ-BD ) also record . Clinical measurement obtain baseline ( immediately surgery ) twelve month report . After debridement surgical site , bottom defect ( BD ) define distance cemento-enamel junction base defect . Bone crest level ( BC ) measure distance cementoenamel junction crest defect intra-bony defect depth ( INTRA ) measure subtraction BC BD measurement ( BD-BC ) . Moreover , depth three , two one-wall sub-components bony defect also measure . The primary secondary outcome variable present study , respectively , change PAL bone gain ( change distance CEJ-BD ) . In order ensure reproducibility consistency pre- post-intervention measurement , examiner calibration perform begin study . Fourteen sit , seven patient , probe depth &gt; 6 mm evaluate examiner two separate occasion , 48h apart . Flap Design Intracrevicular incision make buccal lingual mucoperiosteal flap , include least one tooth mesial another distal tooth treat , elevate blunt dissection . Extreme care take preserve marginal gingiva inter-dental tissue achieve good closure treat site . Thus , defect-associated inter-dental papilla access papilla preservation ﬂap technique ( Takey 1985 , Cortellini et al . 1995 , Cortellini et al . 1999 ) accord indication . A vertical releasing incision perform mesial aspect flap whenever necessary obtain optimized , tensionless , access surgical area . Root bone defect debridement The bone defect meticulously debrided surgical curette ultrasonic instrument special effort remove inflammatory granulation tissue , intention perforate cortical bone wall . Thorough root planing perform hand ( Hu-Friedy , IL , USA ) , rotary ( Intensiv , Grancia , Switzerland ) ultrasonic instrument ( Cavitron , Dentisply , USA ) , remove subgingival plaque calculus root surface attain hard glassy surface . During instrumentation , ﬂaps slightly elevate , carefully protect periosteal elevator , frequently irrigate saline . Root condition rhFGF-2 application After instrumentation , root surface wash saline solution remove remain detached fragment defect surgical field . Then , freshly prepared tetracycline hydrochloride paste saline apply gentle circular movement instrument dried root surface test control group three minute . After , defect area carefully rinse saline . Finally , experimental site , 0.2ml gel contain 4mg/ml rhFGF-2 sodium hyaluronate MW 1.3 x 106 applied dry root surface bone defect . The flap reposition tension-free primary flap closure obtain use internal mattress , single interrupt suture ( 5.0 Ethicon Sutures , Johnson &amp; Johnson , NJ , USA Gore-tex Sutures , W.L Gore , AZ , USA ) . Post-Operative Treatment The patient prescribe systemic antibiotic therapy consist 200mg doxycycline***** day surgery , follow 100 mg daily continue 20th day surgery . No surgical dressing use . The patient instruct continue regular home hygiene care , except operated area , clean mean gentle topical application 0.2 % chlorhexidine gluconate ( Perioxidin® , Lacer , Barcelona , Spain ) saturate cotton swab . Patients instruct brush ﬂoss surgical area 4 week , mechanical plaque control re-instituted . The suture remove two week surgery . Hyper-mobile teeth splint either immediately surgical procedure . Maintenance Schedule Patients enrol stringent post-operative supportive care programme follow surgery ( Santana et al 2009 ) . All patient see weekly first three month bi-weekly next three month . Thereafter , patient see monthly last six-month period study . After 1 year , patient recall re-instructed proper oral hygiene . Sites rescaled indicated . Radiographic assessment Radiographs take parallel , standardized , technique baseline ( Eickholz et al . 2004 ) . Radiographs digitize analyse use NIH Image Analysis software . The anatomical landmark study include cementum-enamel junction ( CEJ ) , alveolar crest ( AC ) base defect ( BD ) ( Schei et al . 1959 ) . Radiographic defect depth measure along root surface , parallel root axis , distance CEJ BD . Statistical Analyses Quantitative data record mean standard deviation . No data point miss . Sample size determine Power analysis , assume standard deviation difference 0.5 , indicate sample 20 subject , study would &gt; 90 % power detect 1-mm difference primary outcome measure PAL gain CEJ-BD reduction two group . In order verify normality data , kurtosis skewness curve use . Because data consider normal parameter analyse , Student 's paired t-test use intra-group ( baseline versus 12 month ) inter-group ( test versus control ) comparison . The level significance set 5 % use statistical comparison perform software ProStat ( Poly Software International , Pearl River , NY , USA ) .</detailed_description>
