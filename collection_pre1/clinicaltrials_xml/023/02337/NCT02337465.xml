	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study kilo-voltage cone beam compute tomography ( KV-CBCT ) ultrasound image work guide radiation therapy patient prostate , liver , pancreatic cancer . Computer system , KV-CBCT ultrasound imaging , allow doctor create 3-dimensional picture tumor may help plan radiation therapy may result tumor cell kill .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>KV-CBCT Ultrasound Imaging Guiding Radiation Therapy Patients With Prostate , Liver , Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate feasibility combine on-board cone beam compute tomography ( CBCT ) ultrasound image overcome shortcoming CBCT ultrasound image alone image guide radiotherapy delivery . OUTLINE : Patients undergo ultrasound image prior radiation therapy . Patients also undergo kilo-voltage cone beam compute tomography prior radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
