Milk thistle use range psychiatric disorder include methamphetamine abuse obsessive compulsive disorder , two psychiatric disorder similarity gamble disorder . The flavanoid complex silymarin preclinical study find increase serotonin level cortex , ameliorate decrease dopamine serotonin prefrontal cortex hippocampus associate methamphetamine abuse .

Studies show high cortical dopamine level associate improved frontal cortical cognitive performance . Cortical inhibition felt basis top-down control motivate behavior . A recent randomized control study milk thistle conduct Iran Thirty five participant moderate OCD randomly assign 200 mg milk thistle leaf extract 10 mg fluoxetine three time daily eight week .
