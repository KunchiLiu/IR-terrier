	<brief_summary>Tremendous effort resource expend global community ensure antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) available accessible need . Despite , less half Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) -infected patient require ART sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) receiving . Some significant barrier attain universal access ART region include large distance patient travel clinic , time spend access care significant shortage human resource . In order address challenge World Health Organization ( WHO ) advocate alternative care model especially incorporate task-shifting low cadre health care worker lay person . Unfortunately , alternative care model identify little data exist long-term outcome . With project develop assess alternative care model establish platform HIV-infected peer-group ( ART Co-op ) facilitate community health worker ( CHW 's ) . This model care intend decentralize ART service bring close patient . Specifically , : 1 . Develop acceptable sustainable model extend HIV care treatment community . 2 . Perform pilot study compare outcome patient enrol ART Co-ops program receive standard care . 3 . Determine cost saving cost effectiveness ART Co-ops .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Universal Access ART : Since 2003 concert international effort increase access ART HIV-infected individual live low middle income country . [ 1-6 ] Despite substantial increase number people receive ART SSA , end 2010 49 % 10,400,000 person need ART receive treatment . [ 7-8 ] This far short universal ART access goal ≥80 % need treatment . [ 2 ] Given SSA command 3 % world 's health care provider contribute 1 % global health care expenditures , significant barrier meeting goal profound shortage infrastructure resource , specifically , train medical personnel . [ 9-10 ] With regard Kenya , WHO estimate country able provide 25 % 240,000 physician need serve country 's population 2015 . [ 11 ] New initiative consideration `` Test Treat '' , Option B+ ( ART pregnant woman lifelong maintenance ) treatment index partner within HIV-discordant relationship tax already strain health care work force . [ 12-22 ] As , unless new care model develop require few health care provider resource maintain optimal patient outcome , goal universal access unachievable . Retention Care : The high program attrition rate SSA make achieve universal access even complex . A meta-analysis HIV-care program resource-constrained setting estimate one two-year attrition rate ( define death lose follow ( LTFU ) ) 22.6 % ( range 7-45 % ) 25 % ( 11-32 % ) , respectively . [ 23 ] Of approximately 41 % confirm dead 59 % LTFU . Patients LTFU represent heterogeneous outcome include death , care elsewhere , disengage care . [ 24 ] Patients disengage care high risk morbidity , mortality transmit HIV . [ 25-29 ] Despite desirability provide outreach patient LTFU , cost program frequently come expense expand ART access . Geographic accessibility ( distance clinic transportation cost ) shortages health care personnel ( excessive clinic wait time ) document barrier retention . [ 24-25,30-35 ] As , optimal ART care model resource constrain setting minimize LTFU reduction transport time cost well reduce clinic waiting time . Task Shifting : In response severe shortage health care worker SSA , WHO organizations advocate task shift low cadre health care worker lay individual , include person live HIV ( PLWHIV ) , order maximize patient ' access ART . [ 36-39 ] Such strategy decrease physician resource requirement , allow decentralize ART delivery , improve patient retention . [ 26,40-50 ] Médecins Sans Frontières ( MSF ) develop model care allow PLWHIV become active participant care care community member . [ 49 ] They successfully form Community ART Groups ( CAGs ) facilitate ART distribution , promote adherence , provide social support monitor clinical status . During monthly group meeting CAG member choose represent group clinic member 's status discuss group 's monthly ART supply pick . Retention exceptionally high 97.5 % patient remain care median follow-up period 12.9 month ( range 8.5-14 month ) . Cost Effectiveness : Site-level cost study HIV care service show human resource cost major determination treatment scale-up cost , , support recommendation task-shifting . [ 51-53 ] Despite , cost cost-effectiveness study assess alternative ART-delivery model . [ 54-59 ] Justification study : This study propose refine test HIV-care model utilizes CHWs PLWHIV participate care . The traditional ART-care model require patient attend monthly every 4 monthly clinic visit conduct physician , clinical officer ( CO ) nurse . This model utilize significant health worker patient time resource , patient monetary resource travel , care-model disconnect local community . This proposal shift paradigm intensive clinic-based supervision ART-delivery monitoring community-based cooperative group ( ART Co-ops ) . We believe innovative model will:1 ) decrease amount healthcare worker resource require provide HIV-care ; 2 ) decrease cost ; 3 ) improve retention care ; 4 ) increase access ART 5 ) maintain durability patient ART regimen limit health encounters.Given model utilizes system stakeholder already present community believe scalable resource constrain environments.ART Co-ops would provide logical gateway community HIV-clinics HIV-infected individual identify '' Test Treat '' initiatives community-based health resource HIV infected individual ( i.e. , index partner discordant relationship pregnant woman ) . Intended/potential use study finding : By achieve specific aim anticipate develop model HIV-care minimize number health care provider need deliver HIV care maximize patient outcome include durability ART regimen engagement retention care.We anticipate model scalable setting SSA resource necessary model exist community within region . Adoption model potential allow cost effective delivery ART-care resource-constrained setting . Study design/locations : We conduct formative research ( assessment secondary data , FGDs KIIs ) guide development refinement ART Co-ops model propose Specific Aim 1 . A randomized prospective trial compare outcomes subject enrol ART Co-ops Model receive standard care Specific Aim 3 . This study conduct AMPATH Partnership clinic Kitale , Kenya , part HIV care treatment program currently operate 108 clinic western Kenya [ 60-61 ] . The AMPATH clinic Kitale currently 19,000 patient enrol &gt; 12,000 ART . This one AMPATHs rapidly grow clinic population make ideal site study implement use community care model . Objectives : Our long term goal development successful implementation HIV care system facilitate achievement universal access maximize retention ART program SSA . The major objective proposal develop assess community-based ART delivery model establish platform HIV-infected peer-group ( ART Co-op ) facilitate CHWs . Our central hypothesis durability patient 's ART regimen ( require change second line failure ) remain equivalent see clinic regularly clinic outcome ( adherence visit ( clinic visit control group ART Co-ops intervention group ) , retention care ( receive care see ART Co-op group within 3 month last scheduled visit ) , adherence ART ( &gt; 90 % ART take time ) ) similar community-based model standard care . We base hypothesis previous study utilize task-shifting provide ART care well recent data Mozambique [ 49 ] use community ART-Groups . Aims/Hypotheses : SA1 : Develop acceptable model extend HIV care treatment community . H1 : Information gather FGDs KIIs allow refinement ART Co-op model promote community patient acceptance . SA2 : Develop sustainable model extend HIV care treatment community . H2 : ART Co-ops assemble manage assistance CHWs . SA3 : Perform pilot study compare outcome patient enrol ART Co-ops program receive standard care . H3a : Adherence HIV-care visit ( Co-op group meeting /or clinic visit ) retention care well ART Co-ops group . H3b : Adherence ART equivalent group . H3c : Durability ART regimen equivalent group . H3d : Patient perceive quality life well ART Co-op group participant . SA4 : Determine cost saving cost effectiveness ART Co-ops . H4a : ART Co-ops generate cost saving patient well HIV care program . H4b : ART Co-ops cost effective standard care view program perspective . General approach : A variety approach use Specific Aims respective hypothesis . Specific Aim 1 qualitative , utilize information gather KIIs FGDs inform refinement ART Co-op model necessary promote community patient acceptance prove ' sustainability within community . Specific Aim 2 process orient , allow assembly ART Co-ops . Specific Aim 3 comparative , allow assessment ART Co-op group compare standard care anticipate ability improve adherence HIV-care visit patient 's perceive quality life ( QOL ) , maintain equivalent level adherence durability ART regimen . Specific Aim 4 descriptive , evaluate intervention cost effectiveness .</detailed_description>
