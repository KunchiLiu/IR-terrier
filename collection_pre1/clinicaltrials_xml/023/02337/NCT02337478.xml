	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial study well vincristine sulfate liposome work treat patient acute myeloid leukemia return period improvement respond previous treatment . Drugs use chemotherapy , vincristine sulfate liposome , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Liposomal encapsulation prolongs bioavailability ( proportion drug enters circulation introduce body ) vincristine sulfate , may increase delivery cancer cell few side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vincristine Sulfate Liposome Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility administer vincristine sulfate liposome injection ( VSLI ) relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient fail , refuse candidate least one chemotherapy salvage regimen . II . To observe hematologic improvement-rate VSLI patient population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe overall survival patient treat VSLI . II . To observe response rate ( complete remission [ CR ] , complete remission incomplete count recovery [ CRi ] , partial response [ PR ] , morphologic leukemia free state [ MLFS ] ) VSLI patient population . OUTLINE : Patients receive vincristine sulfate liposome via injection day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
