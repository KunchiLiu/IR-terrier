	<brief_summary>The hemiparesis one important sequela stroke , generally great impairment upper limb ( UL ) contralateral brain injury . To obtain great amount use affect UL movement quality , study describe rehabilitation technique constraint Induced Therapy ( CIT ) . The objective study evaluate effect CIT severe hemiparetics patient quantity quality movement UL grip strength , relation scapular kinematics trunk quality movement measure clinically . Randomized crossover study systematic review AB mode , A baseline evaluation period 2 week without intervention B , two-week period intervention . One group start intervention period ( BA ) group period without intervention ( AB ) . The intervention 3 hour / day , 5x / week two week use wrist finger restriction UL unaffected . To evaluate quality quantity UL use real environment use Motor Activity Log ( MAL ) , quantify motor skill Wolf Motor Function Test ( WMFT ) , 3D movement scapula trunk arm elevation functional activity UL measure electromagnetic tracking system grip strength hand dynamometer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Constraint-induced Therapy Scapular Kinematics Patients With Severe Chronic Hemiparesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized crossover study systematic review AB mode , A baseline evaluation period 2 week without intervention B , two-week period intervention , develop Evaluation Laboratory complex intervention shoulder Federal University São Carlos ( UFSCar ) . Patients divide two group online tool www.randomization.com . One group start intervention period ( BA ) group period without intervention ( AB ) . As evaluator know distribution patient group , blind pre post intervention . The quantity variable , quality movement , time perform task grip strength UL measure MAL WMFT , evaluate five moment : baseline , end phase A , end phase B , monitor 1 3 month crossover period . The evaluation scapular kinematics trunk occur begin four-week period end . Measures shall perform principal investigator physiotherapist train Group Research Therapy Induced restrain University Alabama Birmingham 2008 , head Edward Taub ( creator technique ) David Morris . The intervention carry three physical therapist train . Thus , protocol base principle recommend Extremity Constraint-Induced Therapy Evaluation ( EXCITE ) , project involve seven center North American research . The sample size calculate main variable , quality movement measure LAM . The effect size consider clinically relevant MAL 1.0 scale 0 5 . The standard deviation variable population severe hemiparesis find study . With power 80 % α-probability error 5 % would require 16 patient total .</detailed_description>
