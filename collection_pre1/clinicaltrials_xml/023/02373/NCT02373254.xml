	<brief_title>NSAIDS Versus Opioids Acute SER II Ankle Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain management acute fracture challenge influenced several factor contribute pain perception . These factor include limited tissue damage local impact , mechanical stress fracture end , central perception noxious stimulus . Tissue damage mechanical stress lead inflammation local swelling . Swelling significant contributor pain development . Ideal pain management would attack pain development sit possible . The current clinical practice US apply derivate opioid analgesic combine acetaminophen , thereby influence pain development central perception opioid analgesic acetaminophen peripheral analgesic effect acetaminophen . The exact mechanism peripheral effect know . This clinical practice disregard positive effect medication influence peripheral inflammatory response , namely nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) . NSAIDs affect pain development block synthesis arachidonic acid metabolite , inhibit peripheral inflammatory response central pain perception . The major reason apply NSAIDs treatment acute fracture pain experimental animal study show decrease bone heal relation NSAID usage . However , clinical data thus far inconclusive , whether bone healing affect human whether NSAIDs avoid set bone fracture . This propose study give answer whether usage NSAIDs acute fracture negative effect bone healing .</detailed_description>
