	<brief_title>Impact Physical Therapy Program Mouthbreathing Children After Adenotonsillectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although oral breathe child study otolaryngologist , allergist , orthodontist , speech therapist physiotherapist prevalence mouth breathing range 26.6 % 53.3 % Brazilian study , physical , medical social problem arise Mouth Breathing Syndrome ( MB ) still recognize public health problem . Behavioral change sleep quality craniofacial development consequently quality life surgical , orthodontic multidisciplinary approach MB child known.However , little known effectiveness early physical therapy intervention , whereas postural abnormality characteristic mouth breathe child relevant postural pattern adopt may persist adulthood . SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES 1 . Compare linear measurement elevation , scapular abduction depression among MB child preoperative postoperative adenotonsillectomy . 2 . Compare angular measurement upper / low rotation , external / internal rotation , anterior / posterior tilt scapula thoracic kyphosis , protrusion retraction head shoulder protrusion retraction group MB child preoperative postoperative adenotonsillectomy 3 . Evaluate impact physical therapy intervention postoperatively . STUDY DESIGN : Cohort cross-sectional PARTICIPANTS : The sample size calculation base result Correa et al ( 2008 ) , report similar effect intervention propose study.45 child recruit Clinic MOUTH BREATHING ( ARO ) Federal University Minas Gerais ( UFMG ) . To ensure adequate statistical power case loss follow-up consider sample 55 child . ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : 45 male female mouthbreathing child belong racial group age 4-10 year complete INCLUSION CRITERIA : diagnosis upper airway obstruction endoscopy ( pharyngeal tonsil occupy 80 % nasopharynx / palatine tonsils 3 4 ) , history oral route access loss passive lip seal , display good understanding whose family sign consent form approve Ethics Committee Federal University Minas Gerais ( COEP ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : child neurological disorder , endocrine abnormality compromise normal development growth , presence ankylosis , severe lung disease , congenital heart defect , craniofacial abnormality syndromic unfit perform procedure propose study . PROCEDURES Assessment endoscopy hold ARO / UFMG child screen accord inclusion exclusion criterion study . After pass COEP , official accept participate study must sign Instrument Consent . The collection kinematic data hold Motion Analysis Laboratory , Department Physical Therapy . The physiotherapy intervention hold ARO , work regularly Thursdays period three month . STUDY PROTOCOL : Demographic clinical data collect participant . All measure propose obtain previously ( T0 ) three month surgery ( T1 ) . By complete measure base process randomisation perform patient divide 3 group : GROUP 1 ( G1 ) - without physical intervention , oral health education ; GROUP 2 ( G2 ) - guidance booklet home stretch exercise GROUP 3 ( G3 ) exercise -physiotherapy intervention proposal period three month . After three month allocation group G1 , G2 G3 new measure carry ( T2 ) . Those child identify persistent postural change forward continue specialize treatment.The G3 submit postural reeducation lengthen anterior muscle strengthen posterior muscle trunk sit position , ventral dorsal recumbency , include manual technique , stretch sternocleidomastoid scalene muscle . Exercises pelvic girdle position stretch hamstring muscle tibial sural triceps associate respiratory exercise . G2 family receive booklet guidance exercise perform home G3 receive target intervention . MEASURES : The kinematics shoulder girdle , cervical thoracic spine participant obtain System Qualysis ProReflex ® 3 time , regard reliability . This photogrammetry system base video four camera illumination stroboscopy produce group infrared reflector locate around lens camera . Infrared light design camera reflect passive marker place specific point anatomical point body participant . The reflection light passive marker capture camera generate two-dimensional ( 2D ) image respective position marker . The triangulation image least two camera , allow reconstruction three dimension ( 3D ) passive reflective brand . Data obtain process Track Manager software . Subsequently , data transfer Mat Lab program ( Matrix Laboratory ) software , angular measurement calculate use arc tangent function . For measurement orientation cervical spine , scapula , thoracic spine , sixteen reflective tag use , 15mm diameter . TITLE : The orientation scapula include three angular measurement ( low upper rotation / anterior / posterior tilt , internal rotation / external ) two linear measurement ( elevation abduction ) . Upward rotation ( U-Rot ) A : occur perpendicularly anterior—posterior axis corresponds lateralization inferior angle scapula relation spinal column frontal plane glenoid cavity orient upwardly . Angle A obtained intersection straight line pass C7 T7 marker , straight line pass medial edge scapula marker root spine marker inferior angle scapula.Scapular abduction ( S-Abd ) lateral shift scapula relation spinal column . Horizontal distance ( B ) millimeter centroid point scapula spinal column . Greater distance marker indicate great scapular abduction.Scapular elevation ( S-Ele ) : linear upward shift scapular thoracic cage . C obtain vertical distance millimeter marker position C7 centroid point scapula . Greater scapular elevation indicate less distance marker Measures kyphosis thoracic spine , protraction / retraction protraction head / shoulder retraction also undertaken . TIME FRAME : 3 month assessment safety issue INTERVENTION PROTOCOLS The G3 submit postural reeducation lengthen anterior muscle strengthen posterior muscle trunk sit position , ventral dorsal recumbency , include manual technique , stretch sternocleidomastoid scalene muscle . Exercises pelvic girdle position stretch hamstring muscle tibial sural triceps associate respiratory exercise . G2 family receive booklet guidance exercise perform home G1 group receive intervention .</detailed_description>
