	<brief_summary>This single-center clinical research study purpose evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) nalbuphine HCl ER ( extended release ) tablets end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient receive hemodialysis ( HD ) therapy reporting pruritus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study Nalbuphine HCl ER Tablets Hemodialysis Patients With Uremic Pruritus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PK nalbuphine hemodialysis ( HD ) patient unknown investigate controlled dialysis condition propose clinical PK study . Nalbuphine small molecular weight , water-soluble molecule low protein binding ( approximately 50 % ) large volume distribution . In addition , disposition perfusion-rate limited . In end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient HD , nalbuphine plasma clearance may impact , although predominantly hepatically cleared feces . A dose-escalation design select mimic nalbuphine use uremic pruritus ( UP ) patient subsequent clinical efficacy study whereby patient start low dose minimize AEs nausea vomit allow patient develop tolerance particular AEs .</detailed_description>
