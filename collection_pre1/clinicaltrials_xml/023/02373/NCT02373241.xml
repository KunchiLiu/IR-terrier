	<brief_summary>Untreated hypertension renal injury risk factor increase morbidity mortality sickle cell disease , yet early marker progressive disease identify therapy prevent development adverse cardiovascular outcome define . Circadian blood pressure , define 24 hour blood pressure monitoring , accurate clinic blood pressure define secondary hypertension abnormal nocturnal blood pressure dip nocturnal hypertension link progressive renal disease disease . Methodology/Aims : A randomized feasibility trial losartan conduct among adolescent HbSS SB0 thalassemia patient ( 11-19 year ) abnormal nocturnal blood pressure dip . During six month feasibility trial , two dose strategy losartan ( titrate keep clinic BP &lt; 95th percentile vs. &lt; 75th percentile ) analyze safety effect restore normal circadian blood pressure . A prospective cohort study among HbSS SB0 thalassemia patient ( 6-19 year ) also conduct evaluate incidence hypertension role monitor potential biomarkers kidney injury hypertension . Cohort participant undergo annual evaluation hypertension ( 24 hour blood pressure monitoring participant ≥ 11yrs , clinic BP participant ) marker kidney injury/hypertension . Expected Results : At completion feasibility trial , vital background information obtain design definitive multicenter trial hypertension sickle cell disease . At completion cohort study , incidence pediatric hypertension identify role monitor blood urine biomarkers well understood . As therapy patient renal failure dismal , imperative SCD patient risk identify early therapeutic trial conduct prevent progression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Feasibility Trial Losartan Correct Abnormal Circadian Blood Pressure . Cohort participant ( ) identify in-clinic hypertension abnormal nocturnal dip 24 hour ABPM ask participate feasibility trial losartan . Participants offer consultation Pediatric Nephrology prior study enrollment . Participants consent /assent undergo repeat 24 hour ABPM confirm abnormal circadian blood pressure prior receive losartan . At baseline , participant undergo evaluation biomarkers kidney injury hypertension . Participants start losartan 25mg losartan randomize titrate clinic BP &lt; 95th 75th percentile base NHLBI BP table . Participants follow monthly x 6 month receive standard care lab . ABPM blood/urine biomarkers kidney injury , buccal swab circadian gene , hypertension repeat 3 6 month . Participants undergo monthly evaluation adherence pill count questionnaire . Safety dose monitor internal review external review ( DSMB ) . Prospective Pediatric Cohort Evaluate Hypertension Kidney Injury . Patients HbSS SB0 thalassemia , age ≥ 6 year sign informed consent undergo clinic BP , annual ABPM biomarkers determine incidence HTN potential role biomarkers monitor development hypertension kidney injury/disease . Urine collect annually evaluate current know biomarkers kidney disease store future analysis relevant biomarkers . Uric acid process collect blood annually .</detailed_description>
