	<brief_summary>The objective clinical study test efficacy CACICOL20® ( RGTA OTR 4120 ) improve wound heal nerve regeneration anterior cornea , patient population undergo therapeutic laser treatment corneal dystrophy recurrent corneal erosion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cacicol20® Corneal Wound Healing Nerve Regeneration After Phototherapeutic Keratectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo various surgical treatment cornea often suffer neural deficit , due nerve sever remove completely surgery . This result pain , impaired epithelial wound healing , reduce tear production , symptom dry eye , loss ocular surface sensitivity/blink reflex . In addition , surgical wound heal accompany undesirable formation scar tissue , limit postoperative visual acuity . The investigator ' prior clinical experience patient undergone surgery anterior cornea neural recovery slow incomplete , certain situation scar tissue form limit visual recovery . In context , CACICOL20® , regenerative agent approve use heal corneal wound , present interest opportunity improve postoperative corneal nerve regeneration potentially rapid restoration extracellular matrix environment postoperatively , lead improve neural visual outcome . The investigator therefore evaluate efficacy CACICOL20® randomize , double-blinded clinical study , evaluate ability promote corneal nerve regeneration , epithelial wound healing , ocular surface recovery postoperatively . Upon inclusion signing informed consent , patient undergo preoperative examination . Upon satisfy study criterion , patient randomize either treatment placebo group . Group identity mask subject investigator ( double-blind ) . Subjects undergo therapeutic laser treatment cornea single clinic , follow instillation treatment placebo form 3 eye drop total ( give immediately surgery , 2 day surgery , final time 4 day surgery ) . Postoperative eye examination conduct day 2 7 month 6 12 . Examinations include clinical measurement various eye corneal wound heal parameter .</detailed_description>
