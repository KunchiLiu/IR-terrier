	<brief_summary>Nearly 50 % U.S. veterans report experience pain regular basis . This chronic pain often co-occurs disorder include post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , depression , anxiety insomnia . A common approach treat chronic pain opioid analgesic , always effective , increasingly associate abuse misuse . Thus , urgent need develop readily available , safe , practical complementary nonpharmacological approach manage chronic pain U.S. veteran . Chronic pain multidimensional phenomenon , inter-related many factor , include negative mood poor sleep . The central circadian clock , suprachiasmatic nucleus hypothalamus , well recognize regulate mood sleep , even small delay ( shift later ) circadian/sleep time associate depression disrupt sleep . These result suggest later circadian/sleep timing may modifiable risk factor pain . Thus , self-administered morning bright light treatment home may potentially efficacious adjunctive strategy manage chronic pain . This R34 grant develop morning bright light treatment help manage chronic pain improve PTSD symptom , depression , anxiety sleep U.S. veteran . Patients 7 baseline day home , follow baseline pain sensitivity assessment home circadian phase assessment ( dim light melatonin onset ) . Following instructional home visit , patient self-administer morning bright light treatment 6 day , follow reassessment pain sensitivity circadian phase . Assessments repeat another 7 day morning bright light treatment . Pain , mood sleep ( wrist actigraphy ) assess daily throughout baseline treatment . Pain , mood sleep also rat veteran daily 1 month follow cessation light treatment . This study determine feasibility , acceptability efficacy bright light treatment sample U.S. veteran experience chronic low back pain .</brief_summary>
