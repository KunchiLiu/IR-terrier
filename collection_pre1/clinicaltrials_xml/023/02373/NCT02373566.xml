	<brief_summary>In study efficacy acellular dermal template ( Novomaix ) , combine split thickness skin graft , use patient full thickness skin defect , test . Results compare intra-patient obtained conventional treatment split thickness skin graft . The investigator expect treatment provide good outcome regard scar quality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Acellular Dermal Template Treatment Full Thickness Skin Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using dermal substitute combination split-thickness skin graft ( STSG ) well acknowledge therapy burn reconstructive surgery . Nevertheless , ideal substitute available yet . We therefore want investigate use acellular dermal template ( Novomaix ) , combination STSG , treat defect . Patients full thickness skin defect include study . This phase II study aim investigate efficacy use dermal matrix , regard scar quality determine elasticity 3 month treatment . Moreover , graft take ( 5-7 day treatment ) , epithelialisation ( 5-7 day 2-3 week ) , scar quality ( 3 12 month treatment , determine elasticity , colour/pigmentation , use subjective scar assessment scale ) evaluate .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age ≥18 year ( Zurich : ≤ 18 year ) Full thickness skin defect configure way two comparable measurable area graft , minimally 3x3 cm ≤ 50 % TBSA full thickness skin defect time intervention Informed consent patient and/or legal representative . Patients infected wound Full thickness skin wound locate face and/or genitals include Pregnant breast feeding female Patients know concomitant medical condition may interfere normal wound healing ( e.g . immune deficiency , HIV , uncontrolled diabetes , treatment corticoid therapy , collagenoses , cancer ) Known allergy porcine collagen elastin Patients expect ( accord responsible medical doctor ) noncompliant study protocol .
