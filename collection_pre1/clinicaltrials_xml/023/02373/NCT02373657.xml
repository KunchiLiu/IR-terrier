	<brief_summary>Trachoma blind disease cause ocular strain Chlamydia trachomatis . The Carter Center Proctor Foundation jointly conduct trachoma research Goncha Siso Enese woreda Amhara past 8 year , series clinical trial . We find repeat mass administration oral azithromycin greatly reduce prevalence trachoma , mass antibiotic unable thus far eliminate infection . The World Health Organization recommend antibiotic control trachoma , entire SAFE strategy ( Surgery in-turned eyelid , Antibiotics , Facial hygiene promotion , Environmental improvement latrine water point ) . Trachoma common village households poor access water latrine , improve public health infrastructure think important limit transmission trachoma .
