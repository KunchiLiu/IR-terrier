	<brief_title>Sequence Variations Genes Estrogen Pathway Perinatal Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perinatal ( antenatal postnatal ) depression common complication childbearing , affect 10 20 % mother . In general , woman expose fluctuation estrogen level childbearing year , especially pregnancy follow childbirth . For subgroup woman genetic predisposition render sensitive change , pregnancy childbirth act trigger onset perinatal depression . A case control study conduct evaluate association variant estrogen receptor relate gene disorder population . Women attend antenatal postnatal clinic screen Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale case identify . DNA control well throughout antenatal postpartum period case meet DSM IV criterion depressive disorder genotyped various genetic variant . The distribution single nucleotide polymorphisms haplotype non-genetic risk factor compare case control within case group . The risk factor postnatal depression relation peripartum factor demographic , obstetric , anaesthetic pain outcomes investigated . As perinatal depression know contribute inadequate self-care poor compliance prenatal care , early diagnosis treatment intervention critical health well-being mother infant . In short term , identify genetic marker increase vulnerability puerperal trigger depression additional screening tool identify at-risk expectant mother early management critical period mother , infant , family . In long run , may lead identification new pathway treatment target common under-studied disorder .</detailed_description>
