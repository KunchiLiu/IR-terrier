	<brief_summary>Photoaging cause superposition chronic ultraviolet ( UV ) -induced damage intrinsic age process , account majority age-associated change skin appearance . Reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) play key role UV-induced skin damage diminish skin matrix protein level , lead skin age . Strategies utilize endogenous skin antioxidant well plant-derived synthetic compound examine . Astaxanthin mainly marine algae crustacean kind carotenoid well-known photo-protective agent strong antioxidant activity . Several study reveal supplementation astaxanthin effectively protect skin UV damage free radical . In addition , matrix metalloproteinase-1 induce UV irradiation important step toward skin age . Recently , many study point phytoestrogens exhibit agonistic antagonistic estrogen activity , suppress activity MMP-1 skin . Isoflavone kind phytoestrogen soybean mainly act skin bone , inhibit MMP-1 effectively . The present study design take isoflavone combine astaxanthin maximize anti-aging ability objectively measure effect mixture facial wrinkle , hydration , elasticity .</brief_summary>
