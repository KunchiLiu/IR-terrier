	<brief_summary>Treatment human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection require daily oral administration combination antiretroviral drug reduce patient 's HIV level . Dolutegravir ( DTG ) , HIV-1 integrase inhibitor ( INI ) , Rilpivirine ( RPV ) , non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) , approve treatment HIV infection . This study aim evaluate relative bioavailability food effect single dose several experimental fix dose combination ( FDC ) tablets Dolutegravir 50 milligram ( mg ) Rilpivirine 25 mg ( DTG/RPV 50 mg/25 mg ) relative co-administration single dose reference single entity product ( DTG 50 mg RPV 25 mg ) healthy adult subject . This 2-part study . Part 1 conducted randomize , open label , 3-way , crossover design 24 subject . Part 1 evaluate relative bioavailability 4 test formulation relative reference single entity product administer fed state . Part 2 conducted randomize , open-label , 3-way crossover design 3 distinct cohort 12 subject . Part 2 evaluate relative bioavailability 3 promising FDC formulation select Part 1 ( DTG/RPV FDC-1 , DTG/RPV FDC-2 , DTG/RPV FDC-3 ) administer fast fed state . Subjects also receive reference treatment Part 1 co-administered fasted condition . This study consist screen visit , three treatment period single dose study drug separate washout least 9 day follow-up visit . The total duration participation subject study approximately 10 week .</brief_summary>
