	<brief_summary>Preeclampsia important disease develop pregnancy one main contributor maternal fetal complication . The known definitive treatment delivery . Although delivery always appropriate mother , might best premature neonate . In case non-severe preeclampsia benefit delay delivery beyond 37 week . It also well established 34 week expectant management confers perinatal benefit minimum amount additional maternal risk . There area uncertainty 37 37 week . This period clinical need select high risk patient complication benefit labor induction , differentiate low risk patient manage expectantly 37 week . Placental growth factor ( PlGF ) angiogenic factor lower pregnant woman preeclampsia current evidence show predictor adverse pregnancy outcome requirement delivery . Circulating level PIGF 34 week could help identify woman may benefit labor induction delivery delay 37 week low risk maternal complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND The current definition pre-eclampsia new onset hypertension ( &gt; 140/90mmHg ) proteinuria ( &gt; 0'3g per 24 hour ) 20 week gestation . Pre-eclampsia affect 3 % 8 % pregnancy lead cause maternal neonatal morbidity mortality . It subclassified clinical severity severe non-severe gestational age diagnosis early late onset pre-eclampsia ( &gt; 34 week gestation ) . Pre-eclampsia associate abnormal placentation uterine angiogenesis . Pregnant woman preeclampsia show low circulating level placental growth factor ( PlGF ) , proangiogenic factor related placental angiogenesis , compare healthy pregnant woman . Moreover evidence find regard role PlGF predictor adverse pregnancy outcome requirement delivery . The definitive treatment disease delivery . In patient non-severe preeclampsia 34 37 week consensus regard ideal time delivery . AIM : The aim study ass whether circulate level PIGF 34 week could help identify woman may benefit labor induction delivery delay 37 week low risk maternal complication .</detailed_description>
