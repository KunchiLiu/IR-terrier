	<brief_title>The Effects Connective Tissue Manipulation Abdominal Massage Patients With Chronic Constipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic constipation disease symptom condition involve insufficient defecation whose definition vary person person . Health professional define constipation 3 time less per week defecation patient define sensation incomplete bowel evacuation , hard stool , strain , difficulty defecation . Chronic constipation common condition experience general public , reduce health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) negatively affect physical , mental , social well individual . In recent meta-analysis , global prevalence rate chronic constipation report 14 % ; also report incidence rate correlate increase age low-income level , common among female . Because underlie pathophysiology chronic constipation clearly identify , treatment difficult healthcare professional patient . Following elimination pathological secondary cause , treatment chronic constipation initiate non-pharmacological treatment method , lifestyle modification ( increase dietary fiber water intake well increased physical activity ) , defecation training , physiotherapy approach . If lifestyle modification conservative treatment method help patient , pharmacological treatment method , osmotic laxative , stimulant laxative , stool softener , lubricant , chloride channel activator , serotonin agent , may use . At final stage , pharmacological treatment successful patient slow-transit constipation , surgical treatment option , segmental , subtotal , total colectomy , consider . Conservative treatment method use patient chronic constipation may include abdominal massage , connective tissue manipulation ( CTM ) , chiropractic treatment , electrical stimulation , anorectal biofeedback exercise . CTM , one conservative treatment method chronic constipation , generate local mechanical effect mast cell connective tissue short long traction thus create vasodilation reduce sympathetic activity . Subsequently , parasympathetic effect increase improvement circulation promote heal process . But little research examine effectiveness constipation bowel function . In case report Holey et al. , report CTM well abdominal massage improve symptom constipation . Also , another study reveal combination pelvic exercise CTM play role heal bowel function woman immediately post cesarean delivery . Abdominal massage another treatment approach use management chronic constipation . The benefit physiotherapy treatment constipation include mechanical neurological effect . Mechanical effect include accelerate colonic motility , improve colonic transit time , coordinate muscle increase abdominal muscle tone . The neurological effect enhance activity parasympathetic nervous system .</detailed_description>
