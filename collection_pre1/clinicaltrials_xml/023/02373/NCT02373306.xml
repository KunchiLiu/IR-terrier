	<detailed_description>Some study show factor predict ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) recurrences consequently ICD intervention , include patient 's age , New York Heart Association class heart failure , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , presence atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , QRS complex width , status renal function . However , accuracy parameter limit variable may identify vulnerable patient seek . This may important clinical implication patient could receive aggressive antiarrhythmic therapy may undergo prophylactic ablation arrhythmia substrate prevent occurrence arrhythmias ICD discharge . Indeed , study suggest might worth perform prophylactic ablation VT patient previously implant ICD , however , approach enter daily clinical practice . One method risk stratification sudden cardiac death use many year , program ventricular stimulation ( PVS ) . This invasive study assess likelihood VT VF induce stimulation occur . This test also use order qualify prophylactic ICD implantation patient LVEF 31-40 % non-sustained VT ambulatory ECG . The primary disadvantage PVS invasiveness . Modern ICDs relatively complex device number function , include possibility perform NIPS implant electrode locate right ventricle . NIPS readily available , inexpensive , minimally burden ICD battery less disturbing patient , require invasive procedure . Some study suggest appropriate intervention occur frequently patient ventricular arrhythmia induce NIPS , prognostic significance NIPS yet determine . One first NIPS-related study demonstrate VF/VT inducibility test device help optimize ICD programming , however , predictive value NIPS study time . In another study , one first prognostic value NIPS , show induction monomorphic , especially relatively slow VT ( cycle length &gt; 280ms ) prognostic recurrence arrhythmia . This study relatively small , distribution etiology consider , result surprising , eg . previous myocardial infarction inferior wall , rather anterior wall , predict altered outcome , LVEF prognostic value . In addition , study carry many year ago , use primary angioplasty acute myocardial infarction low , therefore clinical characteristic patient group period different contemporary patient .</detailed_description>
