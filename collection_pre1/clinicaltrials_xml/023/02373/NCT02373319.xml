The objective study ( 1 ) validate self-screening method cardiovascular risk require supervision health professional ( include self-measurement blood pressure , lipid profile evaluate dry chemistry , self-administered questionnaire sex , age , diabetes , tobacco consumption ) . ( 2 ) From data , investigator generate personalize recommendation base best available evidence . The investigator also analyze whether innovative approach improve adherence preventive recommendation cardiovascular chronic disease . Cardiovascular risk measure self-screening method compare gold standard ( cardiovascular risk supervise health professional ) . Participants randomly assign intervention ( communication cardiovascular risk recommendation personalize preventive action ) control group ( communication cardiovascular risk ) . Subjects reexamine one year recruitment assess adherence preventive recommendation term improvement control cardiovascular risk factor .</detailed_description>
