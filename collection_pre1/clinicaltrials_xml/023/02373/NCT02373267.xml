	<brief_title>Screening TMA Patients f√ºr ADAMTS13 Activity ( Adamscreen )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective diagnostic analysis enrol 100 patient clinically suspect thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) basis laboratory finding thrombocytopenia , Coombs negative haemolytic anemia increase LDH increase schistozytes . As first step differential diagnosis , patient classify determine ADAMTS13 activity antigen concentration also analyze Shigatoxin Shigatoxin produce bacteria respectively . Primary objective determine relative incidence three major entity i.e . aHUS , STEC-HUS TTP consider distribution age gender well . Mean value ADAMTS13 activity antigen measure date first diagnosis consider line threshold value ADAMTS13 activity pronounce clinical apparent TMA . Furthermore present study intend characterize clinical presentation , clinical course outcome different TMA form particularly regard treatment procedure . Monitoring ADAMTS13 activity antigen change course disease response treatment particular concern study . Family history special clinical condition note identify potential genetic predisposition definite clinical trigger lead disease manifestation .</detailed_description>
