	<brief_title>Helium-oxygen Gas Mixtures Delivered High Flow Nasal Cannula Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory syncytial virus associate bronchiolitis lead cause global infant morbidity mortality [ 1 ] , yet care remain largely supportive . Several recent study show helium-oxygen gas mixture ( heliox ) improve outcomes child moderate severe bronchiolitis [ 2-5 , 7 ] . Heliox safe , inert gas biological effect low density [ 6 ] . By improve laminar flow , heliox improves gas exchange condition airway resistance increase , asthma , croup bronchiolitis [ 6 ] . Recent data show infant moderate severe bronchiolitis reduce length hospital stay heliox deliver via facemask CPAP , compare heliox via nasal cannula [ 2 ] . Limitations study include small number patient ( 84/319 [ 26 % ] ) tolerate facemask therapy fact nasal cannula heliox deliver low flow ( 3 LPM ) . Oxygen increasingly deliver heat , humidify , high flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) system infant moderate severe bronchiolitis PICU . To date , definitive randomize controlled trial show HFNC system effective treatment bronchiolitis . However , several retrospective , prospective pilot interventional study show clinical improvement patient population treat HFNC system [ 8-11 ] . We hypothesize deliver heliox via heat , humidify , high flow nasal cannula well tolerate , safe effective . Specific Aim # 1 : The aim prospective pilot study determine effect heliox deliver via proprietary calibrate heat humidified high flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) system ( Vapotherm Precision Flow Heliox ) child age 0-24 month severe bronchiolitis . Hypothesis # 1 : Clinical physiologic marker respiratory distress improve patient receive heliox via HFNC compare standard therapy follow separation mechanical ventilation .</detailed_description>
