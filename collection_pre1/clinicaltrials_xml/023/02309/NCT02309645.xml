	<brief_title>The Paediatric EVICEL® Neuro Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized , open-label , multi-center control study evaluate effectiveness EVICEL® adjunct suture dural closure compare control obtain intraoperative watertight dural closure . Paediatric subject , undergo elective urgent craniotomy/craniectomy pathological process posterior fossa ( benign malignant tumor , vascular malformation , Chiari 1 malformation ) supratentorial region demonstrate persistent cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) leakage follow primary attempt suture closure dural incision . Paediatric subject study classify : - Newborn infant ( birth 27 day . Pre-term newborn infant bear ≤ 37 week gestation include within group ) - Infants toddler ( 28 day &lt; 24 month ) - Children ( 2 11 year ) - Adolescents ( 12 &lt; 18 year ) 42 paediatric subject intra-operative cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) leak follow primary suture dura randomize 2:1 allocation ratio stratify surgical procedure , posterior fossa supratentorial either EVICEL® Fibrin Sealant ( Human ) additional dural suture . Subjects follow post-operatively discharge 30 day ( ±3 day ) post-surgery . The incidence CSF leak assess within 5 day ( ± 2 day ) 30 day ( ±3 day ) post-operatively detect following : clinical observation , diagnostic test need surgical intervention treat CSF leak pseudomeningocele .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient undergo elective urgent craniotomy/craniectomy pathological process posterior fossa ( benign malignant tumor , vascular malformation , Chiari 1 malformation ) supratentorial region demonstrate persistent CSF leakage follow primary attempt suture closure dural incision ; Administration perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis ; Patients le 18 year age ; Patients able willing comply procedure require protocol ; The subject 's parent/legal guardian must willing give permission subject participate trial , provide write informed consent subject . In addition , assent must obtain paediatric subject possess intellectual emotional ability comprehend concept involve trial . Surgical wound classification Class I ( refer Appendix II ) . Penetration mastoid air cell partial mastoidectomy permit ; The cuff native dura along craniotomy edge side wide enough base surgeon 's judgment facilitate suture allow sufficient surface area adherence investigational product . Subjects dura lesion recent surgery still potential CSF leakage ; Conditions treatment significantly compromise immune system ( AIDS ) ; Known hypersensitivity component ( human fibrinogen , arginine hydrochloride , glycine , sodium chloride , sodium citrate , calcium chloride , human thrombin , human albumin , mannitol sodium acetate ) investigational product ; Hydrocephalus , except occlusive hydrocephalus cause posterior fossa pathology treat . Existing CSF ( ventricular , etc . ) drain , shunt , Cushing/Dandy cannulation Burr hole damage dura ; Female subject childbearing potential positive urine serum pregnancy test within 24 hour prior surgery ; Female subject breastfeed intend become pregnant clinical study period ; Participation another clinical trial exposure another investigational drug device within 30 day prior enrollment expect study period ; Scheduled foreseeable surgery within followup period . Dura injury craniotomy/craniectomy eliminate widen craniotomy/craniectomy recreate native dura cuff ; Use implant make synthetic material come direct contact dura ( e.g. , PTFE patch , shunt , ventricular subdural drain ) ; Planned use dural patch primary suture closure dura ; Placement Gliadel Wafers ; Persistent sign increase brain turgor ; Patient gap durotomy edge great 2mm primary dural closure . Intersecting durotomy scar surgical path previous operation completely remove plan dura resection ; Two separate dura defect ; Major intraoperative complication require resuscitation deviation plan surgical procedure .</criteria>
