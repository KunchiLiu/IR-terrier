	<brief_summary>The overall aim prospective , randomize pilot study investigate whether acute coronary angiography ( within 120 minute ) predefined strategy revascularization , safe implement patient hospital cardiac arrest . The primary question issue whether early angiography ( within 120 minute ) predefined strategy revascularization percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) safe carry group patient . The patient randomize acute coronary angiography compare control group treat accord standard practice coronary angiography possible subsequent intervention accord current routine , usually occur within first three day cardiac arrest .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Direct Subacute Coronary Angiography Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study open prospective randomize multicenter study registry follow hospital cardiac arrest without ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) ECG randomize direct coronary angiography possible intervention usual care without acute coronary angiography . The study include 120 patient total , 80 patient without STEMI 40 patient STEMI successful resuscitation cardiac arrest . Randomization take place immediately ECG take conjunction first medical contact . First ECG take emergency room prehospital situation various reason permit enable ECG recording . Randomization occur emergency room . Coronary angiography do within 120 minute first medical contact treatment group . Randomization do via web base module.The group without STEMI randomize acute coronary angiography treat accord standard practice coronary angiography possible follow intervention competent cardiologist.The strategy avoid coronary angiography first 3 day unless urgent indication occur care process renew chest pain , renew STEMI circulatory instability cardiogenic shock . This also standard method currently practice Swedish international hospital . The group STEMI first ECG log follow , patient group study separately order describe evaluate frequency acute intervention group look survival data compare study population unselected STEMI material without cardiac arrest .</detailed_description>
