Biological therapy , lenalidomide , use substance make live organism may stimulate suppress immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Lenalidomide may also improve effectiveness pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine use prevent infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Improving Immune Response Vaccine Therapy Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia , Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma , Monoclonal B Cell Lymphocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess ability 6 week course low dose lenalidomide improve proportion patient monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis ( MBL ) chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) develop immune response pneumococcal vaccination measure proportion patient &gt; = 4-fold rise pre-vaccine ( day 15 ) &gt; = 2 3 serotypes measure 28 day post-vaccination opsonophagocytic activity ( OPA ) antibodies serum . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate disease status physical exam complete blood count patient participate arm study time 6 week assessment immune response . II . Evaluate time treatment progressive CLL patient study arm . III . Evaluate adverse event profile study arm . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess immune response pneumococcal vaccination measure fold-change pre-vaccine ( day 15 ) 28 day post-vaccination OPA geometric mean titer ( GMT ) antibodies serum . II . To assess immune response pneumococcal vaccination measure fold-change pre-vaccine ( day 15 ) 28 day post-vaccination quantitative Streptococcus pneumoniae immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) GMT antibodies serum . III . Evaluate effect 6 week low dose lenalidomide global immune function include T-cell repertoire , T-cell immune synapse , serum immunoglobulin level , absolute number T-cell natural killer ( NK ) cell . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-42 pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine intramuscularly ( IM ) day 15 . ARM II : Patients receive pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine IM day 15 . After completion study treatment , patient follow day 28 , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis : 1 . CLL accord National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) criteria 2 . Small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) criteria 3 . MBL accord consensus criterion This include previous documentation : Biopsyproven small lymphocytic lymphoma Diagnosis CLL MBL evidence follow : Clonal Bcell population peripheral blood immunophenotyping consistent CLL define : The population lymphocytes share Bcell antigens ( cluster differentiation [ CD ] 19 , CD20 [ typically dim expression ] , CD23 ) well CD5 absence panTcell marker ( CD3 , CD2 , etc ) Clonality evidence k ( kappa ) lambda light chain expression ( typically dim immunoglobulin expression ) genetic method ( e.g . immunoglobulin heavy chain variable [ IGHV ] analysis ) NOTE : splenomegaly , hepatomegaly , lymphadenopathy require diagnosis CLL Patients peripheral blood Bcell lymphocyte count &lt;
