	<brief_title>Visual Tactile Scanning Training Patients With Neglect After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient stroke , unilateral neglect predictor poor independency quality life . Current therapy lack progression intensity base clear criterion . In addition , therapy include rather analytical exercise transfer achieve function activity daily live remains difficult . Therefore , investigator develop criterion base system , investigator match intervention specific neglect relate deficit behaviour . The investigator plan randomise controlled trial ( stage 2 `` development concept trial '' ) evaluate whether Experimental Group 20 Sessions 30 minute visual tactile scan train personal , peripersonal extrapersonal space combine trunk rotation Control Group 20 Sessions 30 minute standard visual scanning programme result large improvement neglect behaviour activity daily life ( Catherine Bergego Scale ) . Sixteen stroke patient leave side neglect ( i.e . right brain lesion ) recruit inpatient rehabilitation set .</detailed_description>
