	<brief_summary>Diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) lead cause new case blindness people age 20 65 year worldwide . Patients DR may go develop severe form disease call Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy ( PDR ) , condition abnormal new blood vessel may rupture bleed inside eye . When advanced stage retinopathy occurs , pan-retinal photocoagulation ( laser treatment ) usually recommend . The purpose investigator study find treating patient use single session lower intensity laser ( Pascal® Pan Retinal Photo-Stimulation , P-RPhS ) early stage Diabetic Retinopathy ( severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy stage ) abnormal new vessel develop , prevent diabetic patient develop PDR . Patients include study randomize three arm ( randomization ) . In one arm patient treat normal parameter use Pascal® laser , second arm patient treat low intensity normal , use Endpoint management system ( new software Pascal® laser allow u decree intensity burn ( invisible burn ) show landmark normal intensity area treat view . And third arm patient observe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The publish evidence clinical trial literature demonstrate conventional PRP use 2000-2500 burn may use safely effectively PDR patient 2 3 session . A recent audit 313 Pascal laser treatment perform Manchester Royal Eye Hospital ( 2007-2008 ) demonstrate 1952 burn may use safely effectively routine ophthalmic practice PDR . A recent study ( PETER PAN study ) present Association Research Vision Ophthalmology ( ARVO ) 2011 Annual Meeting also submit publication ( Am J Ophthalmol ) show perform primary 20ms Pascal target retinal photocoagulation ( TRP ) reduce fluence/minimally-traumatic panretinal photocoagulation ( MT-PRP ) single session use 2,500 burn safe effective treating PDR , without negative effect visual field . Therefore , seem reasonable think single session 3000 burn 20ms Endpoint Management set 70 % fluence safe effective treat patient severe NPDR similar less total energy would deliver retina-RPE complex . Topcon 's Endpoint Management ( EM ) software base computational model retinal heating Arrhenius damage model determine optimal pulse duration laser power various level pulse energy . The algorithm vary power duration concurrently maximize margin visible sub-visible photocoagulation endpoint , provide linear control inherently nonlinear process coagulation . When utilise EM , user first titrate comfortable visible endpoint . Establishing titration endpoint important give consistent baseline , ensure repeatable result patient . With Endpoint Management option activate , laser output pattern percentage titration energy . Power duration modulate make energy adjustment , allow fine gradation laser dosage control treatment endpoint . The visible titration endpoint reference throughout course treatment enable Landmark feature , crate reference lesion titration dose corner pattern . This provide visible feedback dosage positioning treat area . Importantly , EM approach laser therapy allow physician consistently operate realm therapeutic relevance sub-visible treatment . When burn visible , big risk become lack therapeutic effect . The Arrhenius integral-based algorithm Endpoint Management adjust power duration provide best `` path '' endpoint , move smoothly ophthalmoscopically-visible titration point angiographically-only , OCT-only , sub-visible/ therapeutic regime . The Landmark feature allow user determine local effect titration dose , make adjustment uptake varies across treated area . The result predictable sub-visible laser delivery wide window safe , effective treatment . The Pascal® system EM utilize 577nm laser wavelength compare 532nm laser wavelength utilized previous Pascal® laser study . However , previous study able demonstrate clinical effectiveness dependent laser wavelength . In order reduce risk complication PRP whilst maintain clinical efficacy , optimal regime may utilize technique low intensity burn reduce power apply large number treatment burn cover retinal area . It may also important `` target '' laser treatment retinal area `` penumbra '' critically hypoxic retina base angiographic test . `` Ischaemic penumbra '' critically hypoxic tissue characterise Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) upregulation secretion angiogenic protein Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . In ischemic diabetic retinopathy , 3 theoretical/postulated location critically hypoxic inner retina : 1 . Along interface inner retinal area still oxygenate via retinal capillary ( peripheral ) area capillary non-perfusion , 2 . Alongside medium-sized retinal artery hyperoxaemic retinal vein form arterio-venous anastomosis traverse non-perfused inner retina ( `` Krogh secondary tissue cylinder '' ) , 3 . Mid-peripheral non-perfused inner retina obtain degree oxygenation choroid via O2 penetration `` metabolic O2 barrier '' form rod inner segment . Fundus autofluorescence Fourier-domain OCT image data suggest low burn intensity reduce fluence burn could achieve effective uptake within out retina.. confirm effective laser uptake use Pascal® multi-spot technique 10-20ms pulse duration ( Laser energy deliver tissue reduce either reduce intensity laser duration burn ) . Furthermore , analysis barely-visible laser titration burn show effective thermal destruction inner segment photoreceptors , highly energetic metabolism , principal tissue target laser photocoagulation . In treatment PDR , severity visual field loss may correlate burn density , long pulse duration , high fluence . The ETDRS recommend 1 burn-widths spot-spacing , however investigator aim maximize retinal laser coverage single sitting , also allow potential re-treatments safely place previous array burn thus prevent overlap laser burn nerve fiber layer defect . Visual acuity , visual field ( VF ) testing , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) important tool quantify degree visual dysfunction . Central ( 24 degree ) visual field measure diabetic patient show correlate well stage retinopathy accord ETDRS scale . Pan-retinal photocoagulation show marked effect upon central visual field measure global index ( Mean Deviation Pattern Standard Deviation ) point-by-point measure . OCT sensitive instrument diagnose monitor DMO , central retinal thickness ( CRT ) measure use clinical practice . In addition , multispectral camera use effectively recent study ( Manchester Targeted Retinal Photocoagulation Study , MTRAP ) , promise result produce may help explain clinical effect study laser treatment . ETDRS data show initiating scatter photocoagulation prior development high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy patient type I diabetes reduce risk severe visual loss . However , ETDRS analyse indicate patient type II diabetes , especially important consider scatter photocoagulation time development severe nonproliferative early proliferative retinopathy . Ferris also show patient type II diabetes , old patient diabetes , likely benefit early scatter photocoagulation patient type I diabetes . The recommendation Royal College Ophthalmologists consider PRP retinopathy reach proliferative stage . The reason scatter laser PRP generally recommend severe NPDR UK ( prevent progression PRD thereby ) include : ( ) uncertainty desirable clinical end-points treatment ( eg . whether moderate NPDR mild NPDR ) , ( ii ) likelihood complication PRP ( DMO visual field loss ) outweigh potential benefit early treatment . However , recommendation date base experience result use argon laser per EDTRS guideline . It important assess benefit Pascal single-session subthreshold scatter panretinal photocoagulation . As previously mention , previous attempt early PRP involve use argon laser system different treatment strategy : full retinal thickness burn , less number burn multiple treatment session . Laser treatment use parameter currently consider tissue ablative . It also possible , time , neither image much clarity investigator today area retinal ischaemic penumbra treat peripheral retina far anteriorly do today . The investigator show use Pascal20ms light burn allow tissue heal response show Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) Fundus Autofluorescence ( AF ) retinal imaging . The use minimally-traumatic high-burn dosimetry ( 3000 burn ) Pascal Pan Retinal Photo-Stimulation Pre-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy may implications term NHS diabetic eye care . Single session treatment Pascal retinal laser may significant cost save effect NHS department , treatment time significantly reduce well number require session outpatient clinic appointment . The Pascal system would allow large number patient safely treat per clinic session . Reducing number patient risk conversion proliferative disease could significant cost save effect NHS reducing frequency hospital visit cost treatment , importantly would offer significant overall benefit patient . Currently , Diabetic National Service Framework English National Screening Programme Diabetic Retinopathy outline target treat PDR within two week diagnosis eye clinic diabetic screening service . In current practice , target may achievable around 75 % patient . If clinical hypothesis achieve , high percentage would perhaps achievable number patient proliferative retinal diabetic disease require treatment would go . Novel P-RPhS Pascal treatment strategy may improve comfort safety patient 's laser journey , increase compliance laser treatment follow-up .</detailed_description>
