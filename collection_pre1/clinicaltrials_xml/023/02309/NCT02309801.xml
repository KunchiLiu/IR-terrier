	<brief_title>Interaction Between Natural Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2 ( ALDH2 ) Inhibitor Alcohol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Soybeans contain isoflavones , biologically active polyphenols know antioxidant phytoestrogens . These isoflavones include daidzin , daidzein , genistin glycitin , implicate beneficial effect soy consumption . Daidzin daidzein isoflavones contain soybean act natural inhibitor aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 . Animal study demonstrate soy isoflavones reduce auto-administration cocaine suggest might useful treat cocaine dependence . Aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor , disulfiram , currently use human treat alcohol dependence interfere ethanol metabolism ( specifically transformation acetaldehyde acetate . Alcohol intake disulfiram administration increase concentration acetaldehyde blood ( five 10 time high find metabolism amount alcohol alone ) . The combination produce acute symptom severe `` hangover '' ( name disulfiram-like reaction ) , patient may experience symptom flush skin , tachycardia , shortness breath , nausea , vomit , throb headache , visual disturbance , mental confusion , case severe reaction postural syncope , circulatory collapse . In addition , disulfiram demonstrate clinical efficacy cocaine dependence . The mechanism action effect related ability decrease dopamine degradation inhibit dopamine-beta-hydroxylase enzyme ( metabolizes dopamine norepinephrine ) , increase concentration area brain . The aim study ass whether soy extract contain isoflavones ( daidzin , daidzein genistein ) could interfere alcohol metabolism produce adverse effect human .</detailed_description>
