	<brief_summary>CT perfusion ( CTP ) brain innovative technique identify rapidly region partially insufficiently perfuse acute ischemic event . The differentiation core infarct still viable penumbra major clinical application . CTP help directly decision-making process event acute ischemic stroke increase potential success patient benefit thrombolytic/endovascular treatment . The use CTP patient selection thrombolytic/endovascular treatment never evaluate prospective randomize study . Yet , clinical experience well demonstrate good correlation size penumbra clinical outcome do early well late stage event . The importance identify penumbra acute phase ischemic stroke widely accept . But crucial evidence support predictive value CTP predict clinical anatomical/structural outcome late phase ( 90 day ) lack . Currently , use CTP base theoretical assumption expert opinion randomize prospective study validate use lacking . The current guideline restrict use CTP trial patient ca n't perform MRI scan .</brief_summary>
