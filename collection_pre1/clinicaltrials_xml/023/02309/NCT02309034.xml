	<detailed_description>Methods : The sample select intentionally 75 subject . Those agree participate study randomly allocate three group blind evaluator study , use online www.randomizer.org software follow : aqua + nutritional counseling , jump + nutritional counseling , group control ( nutritional counseling ) , 12-week duration . The study examine effect obtain three group outcomes cardiometabolic risk factor ( waist circumference , blood pressure , HDL-cholesterol , triglyceride , fast glucose ) , outcomes amount distribution body fat ( sum skinfolds - triceps subscapular , suprailiac , abdominal mid thigh - bioelectrical impedance body fat percentage waist / height ) , psychological variable ( quality life , body image mental health ) . In addition , nutritional counseling weekly session use control variable . Characterization data sample ( age , sex , weight , height , waist / height ) biochemical endpoint also comprise study ( total cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol , fast insulin , HOMA-IR , QUICK , high-sensitivity C- reactive protein collect ) . All measurement follow standard validate procedure population object study . To chronic effect analysis , blood sample collect two time , train period , 12 hour fast . To avoid acute effect exercise , measurement do 72 hour 12th week . A sample 5 ml blood per antecubital vein collect . The sample collect school experienced gatherer , take immediately laboratory order ensure analyzes perform day . The health-related quality life assess use questionnaire pediatric quality life PedsQL 4.0 , adolescent parent . For analysis body satisfaction instrument Body Shape Questionnaire BSQ use . To ascertain perception body image apply Scale Silhouettes Stunkard . Mental health assess use Strengths Difficulties Questionnaires SDQ . For classification maturational stage , hold assessment sexual maturation stage propose Tanner , determine self-assessment stage development pubic hair , avoid major constraint adolescent . Intervention exercise : The group perform physical training activity three time week school 12 week , interval training session vary intensity accord scale perceive exertion Borg , duration range 24 32 minute main part . Classes teach physical education teacher aid monitor , area student . Nutrition education class hold school , nutritionist , weekly , total 12 meeting . Training Protocol Both training conduct simultaneously group midst , order avoid possible interference voice command , ambient temperature , relative humidity time accomplishment training .</detailed_description>
