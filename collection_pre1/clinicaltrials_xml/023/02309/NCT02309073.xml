Furthermore , substantial difference pregnancy rate see woman start ART seemingly similar clinical start point information pregnancy/neonatal complication ART limit . For physicians patient would extremely valuable tool could develop individualised chance live birth development pregnancy/neonatal complication calculate . In addition , increase knowledge health risk associate subfertility particular polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) premature ovarian failure ( POF ) . An important void research date absence control group check important new finding . Objectives : The study protocol aim form cohort normo-ovulatory woman regular indication ART aid investigator principle line research : 1 . To study initial predictor ovarian response stimulation IVF 2 . To study predictor chance live birth repeat IVF cycle 3 . To assess role vascular health probability success ART treatment 4 . To study predictor pregnancy neonatal complication 5 . To form control group cycle disturbance study Study design : In part protocol , serum material DNA analysis collect ask patient 20 ml blood drawn routine blood withdrawal . This blood store Biobank UMC Utrecht -80 C. Study population : All woman start ART ask participate .
