	<brief_title>Cochlear Implantation After Labyrinthectomy Translabyrinthine Surgical Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment case vestibular schwannoma Meniere 's disease may require translabyrinthine surgical approach . This surgical approach result complete loss hear surgical ear , leave patient unilateral hearing loss . Though assistive hearing technology exist route signal poorer hear ear well hear ear , affected patient continue limitation localization speech perception noise . An alternative hearing device cochlear implant , would provide signal affected ear . This could potentially offer binaural cue , thus improve localization speech perception noise . Since surgical procedure translabyrinthine approach parallel cochlear implantation , insertion cochlear implant could occur within surgery . A vestibular schwannoma benign tumor cranial nerve VIII affect vestibular auditory system . Hearing loss side vestibular schwannoma may result degeneration hair cell spiral ganglion growth schwannoma cochlear space . Treatment option include observation routine imaging , radiation therapy , surgical removal tumor . Despite treatment vestibular schwannoma , auditory sensitivity may reduce affected side result radiation therapy compromise inner ear cranial nerve VIII surgical removal . Thus , case unilateral vestibular schwannoma patient often leave unilateral profound hear loss . Patients schedule undergo labyrinthectomy intractable Meniere 's disease second population result unilateral profound hearing loss . These patient typically non-functional hearing affect ear prior procedure . The main indication surgery intractable vertigo thus loss already non-functional hearing typically well accept . Though hear contralateral ear may within normal limit , unilateral hearing loss know result reduce speech perception noise , variable ability localization task , increase report hearing handicap , reduce quality life . Due severity hearing loss , patient population utilize conventional amplification would offer auditory input affect ear . The current hearing device option patient population include CROS ( contralateral rout signal ) hearing aid bone-conduction device . With CROS hear aid , microphone position near affected ear pick signal sends hear aid place contralateral ear present signal unaffected side . Bone-conduction device transmit signal affected ear contralateral ear via transcutaneous vibration . Though CROS hear aid bone-conduction device provide patient auditory information side , ability use binaural cue localization speech perception noise variable . It interest potential benefit cochlear implantation population consider profound hearing loss result surgical intervention . A cochlear implant two-part system , include internal electrode array external speech processor . The internal electrode array surgically implant affected cochlea . The external speech processor receive sound transmits signal internal portion . The electrode array present signal via electrical pulse within cochlear space , interpret brain sound . Cochlear implantation report viable treatment option case unilateral hearing loss , include sudden sensorineural hearing loss , severe tinnitus . Further , cochlear implantation show offer superior speech perception noise , localization ability , subjective report case unilateral sensorineural hearing loss compare CROS hear aid bone-conduction device . There limited evidence success cochlear implantation patient unilateral profound hear loss result vestibular schwannoma . One study report variable speech perception outcomes five cochlear implant recipient history vestibular schwannoma due NF2 sporadic growth . Limitations study subject underwent range treatment prior cochlear implantation case review profound hear loss ear . A second study report case study unilateral vestibular schwannoma removal simultaneous cochlear implantation . This subject reportedly experience improvement speech perception ability quality life postoperatively . Determining preferred treatment option patient suffer unilateral vestibular schwannoma still need . Further , limited evidence prefer treatment option patient suffer unilateral profound hearing loss undergo labyrinthectomy intractable Meniere 's disease . One study report patient underwent bilateral labyrinthectomies Meniere 's disease . They report improvement speech perception ability subjective benefit ; however , delay two surgery . Allowing wait period two surgery ideal cochlear ossification may occur , limit ability successfully insert electrode array . Another study also report successful outcome cochlear implantation subject bilateral Meniere 's disease . However , publish report investigate whether cochlear implantation improve speech perception and/or localization ability unilateral case Meniere 's disease . The goal project determine whether subject undergone labyrinthectomy translabyrinthine surgical approach treatment vestibular schwannoma Meniere 's disease benefit cochlear implantation speech perception localization task . If auditory nerve able transmit signal effectively , two population may able utilize combination electric ( affected ear ) acoustic ( non-affected ear ) information improve speech perception noise localization reportedly experience unilateral sensorineural hearing loss population .</detailed_description>
