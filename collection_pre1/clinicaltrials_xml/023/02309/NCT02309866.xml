	<brief_title>Identifying Genes Mutations Underlying Retinitis Pigmentosa Allied Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Retinitis Pigmentosa ( RP ) clinically genetically heterogeneous disease , cause visual loss due premature death retinal photoreceptors . Over 100 gene loci implicate RP . However , contribution gene overall prevalence RP relatively small , many yet find . These unidentified gene likely rare . The vast majority study genetics RP perform American European population . Based investigator experience , genetic makeup Israeli population unique , many genetic alteration identify Israeli patient novel . Working hypothesis aim : investigator work hypothesis Israeli population unique term identity relative contribution RP gene . Therefore , investigator aim perform comprehensive genetic analysis affect Israeli individual various ethnic background , order identify novel RP mutation gene . Methods : RP patient family member continuously recruit study Ophthalmology Department Hillel Yaffe Medical Center , Hadera , Israel . The relatively high proportion founder mutation Israeli population allow u perform quick efficient mutation screen identify cause disease large number newly recruit family . Patients negative relevant mutation study use whole exome sequencing . Bioinformatic analysis use identify possible pathogenic variant . Following verification , investigator check co-segregation disease entire family , frequency relevant population . Expected result : The immediate expect outcome include epidemiological overview RP distribution etiology Israeli population , identification novel causative gene mechanism . These gene expect play crucial role retinal development function , hence identification characterization contribute significantly investigator understand retinal structure function etiology RP . The main expected long-term outcome reduction frequency RP Israel . This achieved combination prevention ( genetic screening counseling among high-risk population ) , treatment ( identification patient group share genetic diagnosis , recruit clinical trial evaluation various treatment strategy ) .</detailed_description>
