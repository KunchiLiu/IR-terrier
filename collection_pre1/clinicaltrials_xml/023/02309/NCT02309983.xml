	<brief_summary>For many spinal cord injury ( SCI ) immobilization , muscle atrophy , bone loss , fracture risk transferring ( fall ) , risk secondary complication , increase attendance care cost . It important develop multi dimensional rehabilitation strategy people SCI enhance functional recovery towards walking , enhance increase muscle bone potentially prepare injure nervous system event cure . Locomotor training ( Stand retrain step training ) activity-based rehabilitative approach generates muscle activity provide weight bear joint contact kinetics , even individual unable stand step independently . Cross-sectional animal human SCI study demonstrate locomotor training ( LT ) ( stand retrain step retrain use body weight support treadmill train ) improve capacity stand independently walk fast speed . Neuromuscular stimulation ( NMS ) electrical stimulation ( ES ) train rehabilitative approach generates muscle activity , alternate leg extension flexion even individual unable stand step independently . NMS study individual SCI show improvement bone density muscle strength cycle resistance training . The main purpose study address whether stand retrain NMS compare stand retrain alone NMS alone increase neural musculoskeletal gain provide great functional recovery towards independent stand . This project complete two site : Kessler Foundation Research Center ( grant PI site ) Frazier Rehabilitation Institute , University Louisville , Kentucky .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There three group study . Each group receive 1.25 hr intervention per session , total 60 session ( 3 - 4 x week , 15- 20 week ) . Participants Group 1 receive 1hr ES lie chair follow 15 min overground training . Group 2 receive stand retrain use BWS follow 15 minute overground training . Group 3 receive stand retrain ES , follow 15 min overground training . Participants complete study 20 week training . The participant able miss 8 consecutive training session drop study . PRIMARY AIMS Specific Aim 1 : To examine effectiveness stand retrain ES alteration muscle volume ( MV ) BMD low limb : Hypothesis 1.1 . SRT ES compare SRT alone ES alone increase muscle volume ( MV ) muscle cross sectional area ( MCSA ) potential muscle torque ( PMT ) hip , knee ankle joint ( compare baseline ) . Hypothesis 1.2 . SRT ES compare SRT alone ES alone increase absolute BMD low limb ( compare baseline ) Hypothesis 1.3 . SRT ES compare SRT alone ES alone increase marker bone formation decrease marker bone resorption commensurate observe increase BMD ( compare baseline ) SECONDARY AIMS Specific Aim 2 To examine effectiveness stand ES improvement functional outcome alteration EMG low limb . Hypothesis 2.1 . SRT ES compare SRT alone ES alone improve functional performance ( measure standing time treadmill overground ) Hypothesis 2.2 . SRT ES compare SRT alone ES alone experience great increase electromyography ( EMG ) amplitude leg muscle examine ( compare baseline ) standing . Hypothesis 2.3 . LT ES compare SRT alone ES alone experience significantly great cardiac output ( CO ) and/or stroke volume SV ( compare baseline ) .</detailed_description>
