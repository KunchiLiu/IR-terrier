	<brief_title>Comparison Two Screening Strategies Gestational Diabetes ( GDM2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Impaired glucose metabolism ( gestational diabetes ( GDM ) mild hyperglycemia ) occur pregnancy associate increase risk pregnancy complication also early indication long-term metabolic dysfunction lead diabetes cardiovascular disease . In US , GDM diagnose use two-step screening diagnostic approach . The International Association Diabetes Pregnancy Study Group ( IADPSG ) propose one-step diagnostic approach broaden definition GDM lower cutoff value include woman milder form hyperglycemia , would screen normal current two-step approach . The goal recommendation well identification woman risk pregnancy complication long-term metabolic dysfunction , result significant increase prevalence GDM . The NIH GDM Consensus Development Conference committee recommend change current two-step screening/diagnostic approach IADPSG one-step diagnostic approach without trial demonstrate increase number woman diagnose GDM result well outcomes . We aim 1 ) conduct `` real world '' randomize control trial ( RCT ) determine difference short-term perinatal health outcome two predominant GDM screening approach , 2 ) prospectively follow mother examine metabolic risk profile growth infant 1 year postpartum . Based pilot study , propose single site blind RCT 920 pregnant woman age 18-45 year without diagnosis diabetes , singleton pregnancy ( 18-24 wks gestation ) . Participants non-fasting 1 hour 50 gm glucose challenge test ( GCT ) perform 24-28 week ' gestation . Women 50 gm GCT result &lt; 200 mg/dL randomize receive either fast 2 hour 75 gm oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) 3 hour 100 gm OGTT . GDM diagnose use IADPSG criterion woman receive 75 gm OGTT Carpenter-Coustan criterion woman receive 100 gm . Participants physician informed diagnosis GDM , blind specific test result diagnostic criterion . Participants GDM receive treatment primary provider . Questionnaires use assess participant ' physician ' view GDM test . Metabolic profile assess randomization year postpartum . The primary outcome measure large-for-gestational age fetal growth . The rationale RCT unique opportunity compare two method . At end study , know whether woman diagnose low glucose level IADPSG criterion likely adverse perinatal outcome . We hypothesize use IADPSG diagnostic criterion result great detection woman impair glucose metabolism treat woman reduce adverse perinatal outcome prevent long-term metabolic dysfunction . This study provide level A data endorse universal screen guideline GDM major organization implementation clinical care .</detailed_description>
