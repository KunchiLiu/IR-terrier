	<brief_summary>Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) rare type leukemia . Because rare , many doctor experience treat . APL show curable time . Unfortunately , patient die early become sick APL , sometimes even start treatment . The early period time diagnosis first treatment disease . This approximately 30 day . Early death often due complication cause effect leukemia treatment . These complication may notice quickly doctor n't much experience manage APL . The purpose study collect information diagnosis management APL patient review medical record . This information store central database Emory University . This data analyze discover impact increase physician knowledge recommend management APL . The goal reduce event early death APL patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Simplified Patient Care Strategy Decrease Early Deaths Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia ( APL ) Maintaining Database</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose collect data patient APL treat predominantly across state Georgia South Carolina also extend cover patient neighboring state . The treatment per treat physician would standard care new drug change standard care propose educate treat physician . This multi-center study . At lead site , patient sign consent form data collect respective site . The site outside Emory center catchment area treat leukemia . The lead investigator available around clock co-manage APL patient . The objective study collect data ass improvement mortality primary center well local treatment center . This change mortality would depend educate community physician nursing staff require regular visit physician nurse coordinator . The community hematologists/oncologists catchment area educate send email investigator 3 month interval inform high early death rate associate APL . In addition , brief pamphlet mail every 3 month reminder . The lead investigator state make presentation regional meeting , visit practice , also call local practice . In addition , nurse coordinator instrumental call upon nurse staff outlying hospital catchment area apprise early death APL also make aware study resource available . This do aggressively first 6 month prior initiate trial continue three-year study period .</detailed_description>
