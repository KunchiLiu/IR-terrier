	<brief_summary>Title : Intravitreal aflibercept ( VEGF Trap-Eye ) neovascular age-related macular degeneration limit response ranibizumab Purpose : The purpose investigator initiate study identify duration treatment effect intravitreal aflibercept sub- intraretinal fluid best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) choroidal neovascularizations ( CNV ) due age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) guide treatment interval fail extend 6 week interval treat extend regimen . Objectives : The primary objective evaluate mean maximum recurrence-free treatment interval ( Imax week ) aflibercept treatment 24 month study peroid ( explanation see section Objectives ) . The individual maximum recurrence-free treatment interval ( week ) 24 week define maximum extension interval reach study follow-up period without show CNV activity ( intra-or subretinal fluid OCT new retinal hemorrhage ) . This measure reflect duration aflibercept effect lesion limit response ranibizumab . Key secondary Outcome Measures mean change BCVA score 24 week baseline ( Δ BCVAscore ) , mean change CRT ( µm ) 24 week baseline ( Δ CRT ) , mean number treatment need 24 week study follow-up , number participant adverse event serious adverse event ( outcome measure see section Objectives ) . Population : This outpatient study population consist representative group 33 male female patient ≥ 50 year age . The study population include patient subfoveal CNV secondary AMD pre-treated intravitreal ranibizumab treat extend regimen fail extended 6-weeks interval without show CNV activity ( information see section Criteria ) . Interventions : 1-arm interventional study 2mg aflibercept intravitreally 4-weekly . The first treatment interval aflibercept 4 week correspond treat extend regime interval increase 2-weeks-steps long CNV activity ( intra-or subretinal fluid OCT new retinal hemorrhage ) occur . In case occur CNV activity interval shorten 4 week minimum treatment interval 4 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Title study : Intravitreal aflibercept ( VEGF Trap-Eye ) neovascular age-related macular degeneration limit response ranibizumab Study purpose : The purpose investigator initiate study identify duration treatment effect intravitreal aflibercept ( VEGF Trap-Eye ) sub- intraretinal fluid best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) choroidal neovascularizations ( CNV ) due age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) guide treatment interval fail extend 6 week interval treat extend regimen . Objectives : The primary objective evaluate mean maximum recurrence-free treatment interval ( Imax week ) intravitreal aflibercept treatment OCT- fundus examination- guide treat extend regimen within 24 week study period . The individual maximum recurrence-free treatment interval ( week ) 24 week define maximum extension interval reach study follow-up period without show CNV activity ( intra-or subretinal fluid OCT new retinal hemorrhage ) .
