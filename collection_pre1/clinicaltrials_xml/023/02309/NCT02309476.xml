	<brief_title>Sub-threshold Photocoagulation Diabetic Macular Oedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic macular oedema ( DMO ) remain common cause visual loss diabetic patient affect around 29 % diabetic patient 20 year disease . The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) demonstrate significant benefit laser photocoagulation treatment clinically significant macular oedema , reduce incidence vision loss approximately 50 % 3 year ' follow-up . The original ETDRS photocoagulation technique adopt throughout world gradually modified year . Despite great improvement , loss central vision , paracentral scotoma decrease color vision adverse event still occur , mostly cause progressive enlargement laser scar consequent visible burn conventional laser photocoagulation . New strategy develop laser treatment minimize chorioretinal damage maintain least similar treatment efficacy . And numerous clinical study conduct subvisible laser treatment . However , lack visible endpoint make difficult treat physician know retinal area treat order avoid retreatment also confident desire target tissue treat . Topcon 's Endpoint Management ( EM ) new software Pascal® laser allow u decrease intensity burn ( invisible burn ) show landmark normal intensity investigator see area treat . The Pascal® system EM utilize 577nm laser wavelength compare 532nm laser wavelength utilized previous Pascal® laser study . This study aim demonstrate 577nm Pascal® EM efficacy effectiveness 532nm Pascal® .</detailed_description>
