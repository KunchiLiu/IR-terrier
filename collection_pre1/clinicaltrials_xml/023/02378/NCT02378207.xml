	<brief_title>Phase 1b Safety Immunogenicity Trial BCG Revaccination , H4 : IC31 , H56 : IC31 Healthy , HIV-1-Uninfected Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study propose evaluate safety immunogenicity H4 : IC31 , H56 : IC31 , BCG revaccination . The study conduct previously BCG vaccinate healthy adolescent , entail thorough immunogenicity evaluation regimens incorporate unbiased system vaccinology approach novel assessment baseline elicit response may impact vaccine response . A major goal study generate immunological data wide range immune response use variety approach include validated assessment , unbiased strategy , novel exploratory assay increase likelihood detect response correlate risk protection prevention infection study . Investigators contribute propose study participate correlate analysis HIV vaccine exhibit modest efficacy 2 correlate risk identify . An additional aim study explore factor affect vaccine induce response may also impact efficacy . For example , hypothesize exposure environmental mycobacteria may alter protection provide BCG vaccination . Reagents evaluate level exposure environmental mycobacteria development part concurrent collaborative study . An exploratory objective trial apply reagent examine whether exposure influence immune response elicit regimen .</detailed_description>
