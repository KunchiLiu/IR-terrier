	<brief_summary>Because atrial fibrillation occur frequently heart surgery patient , overall hypothesis systematic closing leave atrial appendage surgery reduce cerebral embolism come thrombus formation leave atrium . The specific hypothesis seek tested closure leave atrial appendage connection elective CABG / valve surgery lead few stroke micro cerebral infarct measure MRI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Left Atrial Appendage Closure During Open Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients include prior surgery . An MRI perform baseline . At day surgery , patient randomize closure/left open leave atrial appendage . During surgery , maximum 15 ml blood right atrium biopsy take analysis . Additionally , biopsy leave atrium appendage collect group patient randomized closure . The study group recommend double closure . After discharge second MRI perform final MRI perform minimum six month . The final contact patient do one year surgery early . Where clinical interview do phone patient clinical record screen cerebral ischaemic event atrial fibrillation . During study period , patient elect bicycle stress test test level neurohormone , elect monitoring Holter . There also perform transesophageal echocardiography interested patient order test quality surgical closure .</detailed_description>
