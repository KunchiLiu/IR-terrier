	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize , open-label study compare QoL subject end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) require PD conventional in-center HD treatment . Primary Objective : The primary objective demonstrate non-inferiority peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) treatment compare hemodialysis ( HD ) treatment approximately 1 year therapy use Kidney Disease Quality Life-Short Form ( KDQoL-SF ) questionnaire domain burden kidney disease . Secondary Objectives : The secondary objective observe summarize follow parameter subject receive PD HD treatment except remain domain QoL instrument KDQoL-SF™ ( version 1.3 ) 2 individual QoL item score single item , compare 2 treatment group : - Mortality rate - Switch ( PD HD HD PD ) - Transplantation rate - Cause death - Dialysis adequacy ( ie , urea clearance time normalized total body water , volume distribution urea [ Kt/V urea ] determine proportion subject meeting standard care dialysis adequacy ) . - 24-hour urine volume - Change hemoglobin S-phosphate level , percentages subject value within target range - Change serum albumin - Frequency adverse event ( AEs ) serious AEs ( SAEs ) , include abnormal laboratory test finding clinical significance</brief_summary>
