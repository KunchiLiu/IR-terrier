	<brief_summary>The motivation study come desire improve mortality patient sepsis . Oxygen cheap , readily available included current United Kingdom Emergency Department guideline , may also harmful patient sepsis - important know case . This study pilot study also assess feasibility deliver large adequately power study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Hyperoxic O2 Therapy vs. Normoxic O2 Therapy Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently consensus use oxygen therapy sepsis resuscitation . Uncertainty exist whether increase oxygen physiological level ( hyperoxia ) maintain physiological oxygen concentration ( normoxia ) confers benefit patient . By indicate whether hyperoxia beneficial , study hope increase effectiveness sepsis resuscitation . In patient sepsis convincing , coherent pathophysiological evidence-based justification support normoxia hyperoxia . Why normoxia may benefit patient sepsis : Enhanced oxidative nitrosative stress result increase formation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) reactive nitrogen specie ( RNS ) occur sepsis assume major importance development shock-related hypotension , impairment microcirculatory perfusion , mitochondrial dysfunction , tissue injury . It well establish increase inhale fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) lead increase ROS production . The negative effect hyperoxia human well demonstrate number pathological condition include stroke , myocardial infarction lung disease . The pathological process behind condition different sepsis . In small observational study ( 88 patient ) patient sepsis , hyperoxic patient , 8 % die hospital versus 6 % normoxia . Further prospective control trial require . The deleterious effect hyperoxia also demonstrate rat model . Why hyperoxia may benefit patient sepsis : Underlying cellular hypoxia , may difficult detect , suggest major cause morbidity mortality sepsis - may reverse attenuated high flow oxygen . Hyperoxia may reverse arterial hypotension exert anti-inflammatory antiapoptotic property . The beneficial effect hyperoxia demonstrate rat pig model increase survival reduce inflammation . One study rat show benefit survival oxygen administration oxygen administer first 4 hour trial , additional benefit beyond time . A study ( also rat ) demonstrate 6 hour oxygen per 24 hour first 48 hour follow introduction sepsis beneficial anti-inflammatory effect .</detailed_description>
