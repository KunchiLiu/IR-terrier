	<brief_title>Rituximab ( RTX ) Therapy Patients With Active TAO</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diffuse autoimmune hyperthyroidism Graves ' disease ( GD ) common condition mainly affect woman 2-3 % prevalence The increase production thyroid hormone GD driven autoantibody direct thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) receptor ( TRab ) . In case , autoimmunity also affect tissue , orbital tissue mechanism fully understood -Thyroid Associate Ophthalmopathy ( TAO ) . Symptoms sign mild ( grittiness , dry eye , periorbital swollen , chemosis , redness ) -moderate ( double eye vision , exophthalmia severe ( optic nerve compression , corneal ulcer ) . Serious-moderate ocular engagement TAO see approximately 10 % patient GD . Not hyperthyroidism mark impact mental health , presence TAO additional negative impact well-being patient , even many year successful treatment hyperthyroidism . It suggest smoke stress negative prognostic factor course TAO indicate vicious circle . MRI may detect early change CT use predict course TAO . The aims treatment retain euthyroidism achieve anti thyrostatic drug ( ATD ) , radioiodine treatment surgery ( patient pre-treated ATD ) avoid TAO long possible . If moderate-severe TAO occurs , high dose intravenous glucocorticoid ( GC ) gold standard consider side effect . However , many patient non-steroid responder treatment except acute orbital decompression , retro bulbar irradiation later reconstructive surgery offer . When patient relapse immediately steroid often per oral steroid give although recommended literature . Rituximab ( RTX ) mouse-human chimeric antibody design towards pre B mature B lymphocytes block B-cells activation without affect regenerate B cell stem cell plasma cell immunoglobulin production . TAO B- lymphocyte mediate disease two study RTX inhibits active phase TAO . In study Khanna et al positive effect RTX observe six steroid resistant patient TAO decrease inflammation orbit , even though effect strabismus proptosis observe . In another study Salvi et al , RTX treatment compare steroid first line treatment TAO 30 week follow unrandomised study design . RTX decrease activity severity significantly compare steroid group . No relapse observe RTX group steroid group ( 10 % ) . In RTX patient improve , steroid group 65 % . There side-effects steroid group . Selection criterion All patient indication i.v GC evaluate study . The patient recruit consecutively region tertial referral center iv steroid TAO give local hospitals.. Patients study design All patient age 18-70 year western region Sweden TAO indication iv GC ( CAS ≥4 ) evaluate prospective open study RTX+MTX GC non-responders . If GC respondent relapse 12 week iv GC treatment , patient randomize RTX+MTX per oral GC+MTX . If non respondent 4 week intravenous steroid infusion patient eligible RTX treatment Patients see ophthalmological endocrine investigation baseline , 4 , 12 , 18 , 32 , 44 , 56 68 week . At similar occasion anthropometric measurement , immunological marker measure GC effect ( ACTH test , body composition ( occasion ) ) perform . At baseline 30 week high quality MRI Gallium ( GA ) -PET perform . Patients undergo Ga-PET another study focus pituitary imaging ( principle investigator HFN ) serve control orbital muscle . The aim RTX study recruit least 10 patient RTX arm probably 40-50 patient include . No study design previously publish . The present situation offer patient respond GC relapse iv GC infusion effective treatment . If RTX prove safe effective future non-respondent patient able get treatment . In small study RTX good effect TAO , sometimes even well GC less side-effects . It also lay ground future study compare RTX GC randomise study design first line treatment . If GA-PET show useful management patient TAO may become routine investigation .</detailed_description>
