	<brief_summary>The aim study measure urinary milk iodine concentration ( MIC ) , iodine concentration ( UIC ) , thyroid hormone ( TSH , FT4 ) thyroperoxidase antibody ( TPOab ) breast-feeding woman , UIC nursing infant determine level adequate , see influenced 150 ug daily iodine supplementation breast-feeding woman . The hypothesis relative iodine deficiency sub-population - lactate woman nurse children- , influenced iodine supplementation . Adequate thyroid hormone iodine level important small child , plasticity brain great . This prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled study 221 mother infant . In parallel , 90 age-matched healthy non-pregnant woman recruit . Mothers randomize 150 µg/day iodide supplementation placebo . Pregnant woman ask participation visit pregnancy week 37 , mother health care ( MVC ) Mölnlycke Skövde . The study run approximately 3 month individual begin sample A ( UIC , TSH , FT4 , TPOab ) week 37 pregnancy , mother also get randomize 150 µg iodine placebo . New sample B ( UIC , TSH , FT4 , MIC ) collect baby 3 month old . Thereafter study complete . In parallel , 90 healthy non-pregnant , non-lactating woman age range recruit follow UIC , TSH , FT4 , TPOab 6 month control group .

	<detailed_description>Are mother treat 150 µg iodide per day lactation guarantee normal intake iodine breast-milk ( MIC ) normal urinary iodine concentration ( UIC ) off-spring ? Purpose Aim This prospective , placebo-controlled study focus question whether lactate mother shall add 150 µg iodide po guarantee normal MIC UIC level child , current iodinate program guarantee normal level subgroups - Primary aim : To compare MIC UIC child lactate mother receive 150 µg iodide receive placebo compare WHO recommendations . - Secondary aim : To study UIC mother lactation compare control . To study frequency thyroid dysfunction lactate woman whether differs among patient 150 µg placebo . If UIC concentration child breast fed mother receive placebo lower recommend level WHO level normalize 150 µg iodide mother study supportive study national authority Sweden , Europe world recommend lactate mother add 150 µg breast feed even country judge iodine sufficient . Survey field Iodine deficiency nature affect thyroid function The supply iodine varies different part world , mainly vary level iodine ground water , different soil plant , different distribution sea-food , dissimilar diary food consumption . In many area deplete soil long distance sea , iodine deficiency ( ID ) still major health problem . Adequate dietary iodine intake essential production thyroid hormone . Low iodine intake result development hypothyroidism goiter . Impaired production thyroid hormone pregnancy affect growth brain development progeny . Iodine deficiency school-age child impair somatic growth , cognitive performance motor function . Iodine insufficiency outside Sweden Iodine deficiency remain public health problem 47 country worldwide . Although country worldwide implement universal salt iodization , country like Australia , New Zealand several European country report reoccurring iodine deficiency . Changes food consumption pattern , legislation cover process food decrease salt consumption impose new challenge ensure adequate iodine nutrition population . Iodine sufficiency Sweden In Sweden , goitre first describe Carl von Linné 1747 , begin 20th century , goitre detect 60 % case certain area ( 19 ) 18 % total population . A national survey conduct 1929 confirmed endemic goitre region locate inner eastern part country : iodine deficient area know `` goitre-belt '' . These observation contribute initiation Swedish national iodine fortification program salt 1936 . Initially , 10 mg potassium iodide ( KI ) add every kilogram salt . In 1966 , increase current level 50 mg/kg salt , goitre still prevalent region country . The first national evaluation iodine status Sweden perform group accord recommendation World Health Organization ( WHO ) . Urinary iodine concentration ( UIC ) measure representative national sample child age 6-12 year : national median UIC 125 μg/L , indicate optimal iodine nutrition . However , thyroid volume higher Swedish school child international reference study , may effect genetic environmental factor . Iodine intake consider optimal Sweden . These finding underline importance regular monitoring iodine intake , especially concern decrease intake table salt likely follow health campaign patient high need iodine may risk . Iodine demand increase pregnancy lactate The need iodine increase pregnancy lactate increase thyroid hormone production enrichment iodine breast-milk . An intake iodide pregnancy breast feed 250 µg recommend compare 150 µg/day normal population . Severe iodine deficiency new-borne result cretinism . The critical period except prenatal period child two first year life brain still develop . An enhanced risk period first 6 month life child breast-feeding . During period child depend iodine concentration milk , direct consequence mother iodine nutrition . When infant start eat , iodide supply food . Numerous study measure thyroid hormone MIC woman live iodine sufficient insufficient region , summarize three review . Three study evaluate iodine nutrition infant longitudinally , whereas recent New Zealand long ; 6 month maternal infant iodine status measure . In world community thyroid disease question debate whether iodide shall give pregnant woman . American thyroid Association ( ATA ) make strong recommendation fear even mild iodine deficiency small child may affect brain development negatively . WHO modify guideline supplementation whether nation regard iodine sufficient , include sufficient level pregnant lactate woman ( category 1 ) , iodide supplementation need , sufficient . The latter group divide two ; one group patient , &lt; 90 % , eat iodinate salt UIC &lt; 100 ( category 2 ) one group similarly low UIC iodize salt scarcely use ( category 3 ) . An iodine supplement 150 µg recommendation country . However , 2010 Mulrine et al perform placebo control study first 6 month postpartum . The mother iodine deficient , New Zealand implement iodize program , supplement 75 150 µg/day . Both mother child UIC MIC low recommend WHO . The author encourage study do circumstance iodine sufficiency nation . Data pregnant lactating woman Sweden scare . Two small local study report median UIC 145-178 µg/dag 89 µg/l pregnancy . More knowledge need judge Swedish woman shall iodine supplementation 150 µg/day vulnerable period life child . Project description Study design This prospective , double-blinded placebo-controlled trial 221 lactate woman child . Mothers randomize 150 µg/day iodine supplementation placebo 15 week . In parallel 90 healthy female control recruit community stratify age smoke habit . Patients include week 36 pregnancy midwife urinary iodine concentration ( UIC ) , thyroid hormone level thyroperoxidase antibody ( TPO-ab ) assess simple questionnaire fill pregnant woman . Placebo/iodine start visit ( allocation 1:1 ) . At visit 13 ( 13±1 ) week postpartum UIC , thyroid hormone level thyroperoxidase antibody ( TPO-ab ) assess mother simple questionnaire fill . MIC measure still breast-feed . UIC measure baby . At occasion blood specimen take , blood also frozen future analysis . Weight length register postnatal child . Study population Patients At antenatal care unit Mölnlycke Skövde Health Care center 221 pregnant woman age 18-40 year collect consecutively accord inclusion exclusion criterion . Inclusion criterion : Pregnant ≥36 week , Singleton pregnancy , Aged 18-40 year , Intend breast-feed , Agree take iodine contain supplement study postpartum except study medication , No current thyroid disease Exclusion criterion : Patient may attend protocol accord investiga¬tor 's opinion , Plans another pregnancy within first 6 month postpartum , Vegans Controls Controls collect randomized sample attain Swedish Tax Agency premenopausal woman Mölnlycke community . Controls age patient contact mail participation study smoke habit agree correspond patient come inclusion visit . If interested , control tell stop iodine contain supplement 1 week first visit . If answer , remind letter send two week . Inclusion criterion : Aged 18-40 year , Agree take iodine contain supplement study postpartum . No current thyroid disease Exclusion criterion : Controls may attend protocol accord investiga¬tor 's opinion , Plans pregnancy within next 6 month , Vegans Significance If study prove supplement 150 µg iodine mother guarantee normal iodine intake newborn child contact take National Food Agency , National Board Health Social welfare government lobby general directive iodine supplementation lactate woman .</detailed_description>
