	<brief_summary>This small pilot allow surgeon perform wireless breast lumpectomy use new magnetic technology . This continuation previous project test technology , breast surgeon comfort level use new technology . The aim project develop new technique surgical excision lesion either surgical biopsy lumpectomy . The current standard care involve place needle slender wire lesion image guidance radiologist . The surgeon remove lesion use wire guide . This new technique would place magnet lesion image guidance radiologist . The surgeon would use MagneProbe operate room locate magnet remove lesion . This new technique would eliminate use wire protrude patient 's breast . This wire usually place day surgery , prior procedure . The goal new technique eliminate wire placement increase patient comfort throughout day surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pilot II : Before embark pivotal efficacy study , propose pilot II study address ease transition use MagneWire fully implant MagneMarkers . Before embark pivotal study , compare wireless MagneMarker standard breast localization wire , propose open label single arm pilot II study . In pilot II study surgeon ( n=3 ) treat 14 case MagneMarker use magnetic localization alone . The outcome study : 1 . Completeness excision . 2 . Time biopsy . Overview : The goal MagneMark system replace use wire use fully implanted MagneMarkers . In Pilot II trial patient localize morning surgery comparable timeline utilized traditional wire localization procedure . Eligibility surgeon : Experienced breast surgeon practice Maimonides Medical Center full proficiency standard wire localize excision well sentinel lymph node biopsy complete required number MagneWire guide excision train MagneMark system . Because single arm pilot blind surgeon involve . Eligibility patient : Eligible patient single non-palpable breast cancer ( invasive DCIS ) require preoperative needle localization single wire . Lesions may include discrete solitary mammographically sonographically identify target definitively identify specimen image , include previously biopsied lesion mark biopsy site marker . All patient eligible consented label use MagneMarker system randomization , blind stratification patient . Study Location : All procedure complete Maimonides Medical Center . Localizations happen radiology suite Maimonides Breast Center excision happen Ambulatory Surgery Center Maimonides Medical Center . Duration : For enrolled patient participation trial limited amount time localization excision procedure take , approximately 5 hour . To enroll enough patient three surgeon complete fourteen surgery anticipate recruitment continue one calendar year . Description device : The MagneJector use insert 1x20mm Arnokrome MagneMarker anchor position center anchor center target . Sonographic guide localization perform MagneJector hand hold mammographic guided localization perform dedicated prone stereo table MagneJector mount rail . The Arnokrome component MagneMarker coat Parylene , plastic polymer meeting International Organization Standardization 10993 standard biocompatibility . Administration : move MagneMark study procedure day . 1 . On day localization procedure , patient go one three radiologist involve project . 2 . The radiologist insert study device use MagneJector . 3 . The patient transport surgical suite excision . 4 . Surgery perform ambulatory surgery suite Maimonides Medical Center . 5 . The surgeon use MagneProbe identify location MagneMarker well lesion , remove MagneMarker lesion . Data endpoint : rate successful excision target lesion , size weight specimens remove presence absence positive tumor margin serve primary endpoint . Secondary endpoint include length stay day surgery hypothesis length stay significantly reduce . Additional endpoint include comparison accuracy precision center marker center lesion .</detailed_description>
