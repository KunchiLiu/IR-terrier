	<brief_summary>The hereditary type IV collagen disease Alport syndrome inevitably lead end-stage renal disease . Currently therapies know improve outcome . Our non-interventional , observational study investigates , medication ACE-inhibitors ( 1 ) delay time dialysis ( 2 ) improve life-expectancy within three generation Alport-families Europe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>European Alport Therapy Registry - European Initiative Towards Delaying Renal Failure Alport Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early diagnosis child Alport syndrome ( AS ) isolate hematuria open `` window opportunity '' early intervention . Currently causal therapeutic option prove delay renal failure AS . ACE-inhibition ( ACEi ) show reduce proteinuria Alport patient delay renal failure Alport-mice suggesting may value effective treatment delay renal failure human . To test establish European Alport Registry collect data several generation Alport family across Europe . Small child AS first develop microscopic hematuria , proceed microalbuminuria , overt proteinuria , impaired renal function end end stage renal disease . These different step disease enable u assess early introduction ACE-inhibition earlier degrees disease effective later therapy delay time dialysis improve life-expectancy . Heterozygous COL4A3/COL4A4 mutation result phenotype `` familial benign hematuria '' `` thin basement membrane nephropathy '' ( TBMN ) . Affected subject typically present hematuria . Having longtime regard `` benign '' familial hematuria , patient might increase risk develop severe renal impairment - comparable finding female XLAS carrier ( see ) . TBMN rare disease , least 1 % population affect . For first time , present study compare risk renal impairment , end stage renal disease premature death heterozygous carrier XLAS ARAS mutation . Additionally , nephroprotective effect RAAS-blockade patient heterozygous Alport-mutations evaluate .</detailed_description>
