	<brief_summary>THE ULTIMATE GOAL project answer question `` In MILD IODINE DEFICIENCY ( ID ) , 150 μg iodine/day administer pregnant woman normal diet , attain normal cognitive development fetus cognitive deficit mild ID extra iodine need ? '' . To answer question , investigator plan randomize , placebo-controlled trial iodine supplementation pregnancy Sweden ( SWIDDICH ) follow-up childrens ' COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT 18 month , 3.5 , 7 14 year . Iodine deficiency ( ID ) associate thyroid morbidity , especially child , impair cognitive development . Sweden introduce iodine fortification table salt 1936 mental retardation due severe ID eradicate . Is mild ID pregnancy also eradicate ? If , importance ? A national study perform investigator 2007 show iodine sufficiency general population , pregnancy data . Local study raise concern mild ID pregnancy Sweden trans-sectional national study currently ongoing . The burn question Sweden whole world : mild ID pregnancy importance develop brain fetus ? Two large observational study show association mild ID pregnancy lower verbal IQ educational performance school-aged child . The world need randomize placebo-controlled trial ( RTC ) compare cognitive outcome child expose mild ID fetal life child expose normal iodine level fetal life . Our HYPOTHESIS pregnant woman Sweden mild ID child expose mild ID fetal life lower cognitive development , compare child mother take 150 ug iodine supplementation pregnancy . The MAIN AIM SWIDDICH trial determine child expose mild iodine deficiency ( ID ) fetal life achieve bad cognitive development compare child expose normal iodine status reach maternal iodine supplementation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Swedish Iodine Pregnancy Development Children ( SWIDDICH ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIMS - To determine child expose mild iodine deficiency ( ID ) fetal life achieve bad cognitive development compare child expose normal iodine status reach maternal iodine supplementation . - To compare urinary iodine concentration ( UIC ) , thyroglobulin ( Tg ) , free tetraiodothyronine ( FT4 ) thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) pregnant woman 150 µg iodine placebo - To compare milk iodine concentration ( MIC ) colostrum , TSH first 200 newborn child pregnant woman receive 150 µg iodine placebo BACKGROUND Iodine deficiency increase risk hypothyroidism goiter pregnancy abortion cognitive abnormality baby . According WHO recommendation , UIC pregnancy 150-249 ug/L . In 2007 national study show iodine sufficiency Swedish general population . It debate whether iodine shall give pregnant woman iodine sufficient population . The research group start randomize iodine intervention pregnant woman 2012 . The first hypothesis iodine supplementation 150 µg/day need pregnancy Sweden order ensure normal iodine thyroid hormone status mother newborn child pregnant woman Sweden suffer mild iodine deficiency ( ID ) . There substantial gap knowledge regard whether mild ID fetal life entail negative consequence cognition . Two large observational study show association mild ID pregnancy lower IQ educational performance school-children . The two randomize placebo-controlled trial ( RCTs ) study mild ID pregnancy either small safe conclusion draw ( Brucker-Davis et al , n=86 ) , manage separate group base iodine level ( MITCH study , Melse-Boonstra et al , n=839 ) . The need RCT sufficient sample size remain . This lead research team form second hypothesis within trial : child expose mild ID fetal life lower cognitive development compare child mother take 150 ug iodine supplementation pregnancy . The decision expand trial make target number participant recruit increase 200 1275 order reach enough power follow-up childrens ' cognitive development . METHODS Design This prospective placebo-controlled trial child whose mother get iodine supplement 150 µg/day placebo ( multivitamin preparation without iodine ) pregnancy ( week 10±2 delivery ) . The target number participant pregnancy 1275 enable sufficient power child follow-up ( n=788 ) . The main outcome intelligence quotient ( IQ ) 7 year age . Cognitive development child also assess 18 month , 3.5 , 14 year . Pregnancy part Pregnant woman ten maternity care center Sweden randomize daily receive multivitamin tablet 150 µg iodine placebo ( multivitamin without iodine ) . The intervention start pregnancy week 8-12 end directly post-partum first 200 woman pregnancy week 36±2weeks remain participant . This time point may adjust local circumstance , depend third trimester routine visit maternity care center take place . Participants include first visit midwife . Urine sample UIC U-creatinine , blood sample thyroid hormone , thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) , thyroglobuline ( Tg ) thyroperoxidase antibody ( TPO-ab ) collect simple questionnaire fill week 10±2 week pregnancy placebo/iodine start . Selenium iron also measure . The measurement collect week 25±1 week week 36±2 week . Directly delivery ( within 5 day ) , MIC UIC first 200 mother well UIC TSH newborn child collect simple questionnaire fill . Weight , length APGAR child pregnancy complication register . Blood also freeze future analysis access medical file accept . In parallel 90 healthy female control Skaraborg area stratify age smoking habit collect randomized sample attain Swedish Tax Agency . UIC , u-creatinine , FT4 , TSH , Tg , TPO-ab , sample frozen collect questionnaire fill . Selenium iron analyze blood sample first 200 pregnant woman control . The primary purpose control population ascertain normal population area Skaraborg iodine sufficient . Children follow-up At 18 month ± 1 month psychomotor development assess mean ASQ ( Ages Stages Questionnaire ) . At 3,5 year ± 2 month IQ measure ( WPPSI-IV ) , behavior assess ( CBCL questionnaire ) urine collect UIC measurement . At 7 year ± 3 month follow assess : IQ ( WISC IV ) , motor development ( Movement ABC ) , behavior ( CBCL ) , symptom related attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD , 5-15 Nordic questionnaire ) . Additionally , 7 year ± 3 month urine collect UIC measurement , blood sample take thyreoglobulin ( Tg ) , thyroid hormone deiodinases , MRI brain perform subsample . At 14 year ± 6 month , except Movement ABC , repeat . On occasion information socio-economic status possible confounders collect mean questionnaire fill parent child ( 14 year ) .</detailed_description>
