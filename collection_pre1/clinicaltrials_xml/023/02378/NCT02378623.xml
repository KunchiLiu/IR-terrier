	<brief_title>Patients With Patent Foramen Ovale Endocardial Device Leads Apixaban Prevention Paradoxical Emboli</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , randomize control trial ( RCT ) . 400 patient meet study eligibility criterion consent enrollment randomize 1:1 ratio intervention apixaban control group placebo . The randomization perform computer generate block randomization protocol . The majority patient begin intervention Apixaban placebo time cardiac device placement ( n approximately 300 ) , least quarter randomize patient ( n ≥100 ) include preexist CIED ( ≥6 month ) place . Each patient undergo baseline MRI comprehensive cognitive screen examination . Repeat MRI cognitive assessment perform follow-up period two year date randomization ( less clinical stroke/TIA occur prior follow-up period ) . All subject receive phone call 6 month , 12 month , 18 month post-randomization assess endpoint adverse event , well change clinical status , medication , ass study medication compliance .</detailed_description>
