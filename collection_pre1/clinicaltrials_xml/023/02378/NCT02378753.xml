	<detailed_description>The Ebola outbreak confirm March 2014 widespread intense transmission Guinea , Liberia , Sierra Leone . While U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved pharmaceutical prevent treat Ebola , two candidate vaccine test human dose , tolerability , safety . This study evaluate monovalent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus Ebola vaccine remain replication competent ( rVSVΔG-ZEBOV ) Sierra Leone . The high infectivity blood secretion , lack appropriate personal protective equipment ( PPE ) challenge follow infection control prevention protocol put healthcare worker high risk outbreak , direct contact body decease Ebola victim also sustain community transmission . This unblinded , randomized trial evaluate vaccine efficacy ( VE ) safety phase vaccine introduction target population . Participation study voluntary open adult 18 year age old high risk exposure Ebola infection daily work work select study area . This include : 1 ) personnel work healthcare facility care provide Ebola patient ; 2 ) personnel work non-Ebola healthcare facility may exposure undiagnosed Ebola-infected individual ; 3 ) personnel work one follow job category : surveillance team , ambulance team , laboratory worker responsible swabbing deceased person . Staff member involve study also eligible receive vaccine protocol ; study staff follow 6 month post-vaccination monitor safety rVSVΔG-ZEBOV . Eligible participant within healthcare facility frontline team enrol individually randomize either immediate deferred vaccination . A single dose rVSVΔG-ZEBOV administer intramuscularly . Immediate vaccination define vaccination within 7 day enrollment defer vaccination define vaccination end 18-24 week follow-up period . Participants blind randomized assignment immediate defer vaccination . All enrol participant opportunity receive rVSVΔG-ZEBOV end study . Enrollment vaccination phase time . Ebola event occur 18-24 week post-enrollment include VE analysis , immediate vaccination arm contributing vaccinate follow-up time defer vaccination arm contributing unvaccinated follow-up time . All participant , regardless randomized assignment , follow 6 month vaccination monitor safety rVSVΔG-ZEBOV .</detailed_description>
