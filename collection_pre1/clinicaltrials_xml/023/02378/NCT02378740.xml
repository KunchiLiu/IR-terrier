	<brief_summary>Ketamine IV anesthetic non-opioid analgesic property show reduce pain also decrease intraoperative postoperative opioid requirement use subanesthetic dos variety surgical procedures.1 It non-competitive antagonist N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor , mechanism ketamine believe block development central sensitization wind-up phenomenon,2,3 may helpful prevent acute chronic pain repetitive insult . In systematic review ketamine adjuvant opioid analgesia , low-dose ketamine find useful addition standard postoperative pain management practice opioids 54 % studies.1 The study show significant effect patient population low opioid requirement . Therefore , suggest future clinical trial focus patient population significant post-operative pain , spine surgery major orthopedic surgery amenable regional analgesia , postoperative pain patient chronic preoperative opioid therapy.1 There study examine outcome ketamine perioperative period spine surgery . Loftus et al randomized patient history chronic preoperative opioid use ( i.e. , daily opiate use least 6 week ) intraoperative ketamine versus placebo find 30 % reduction morphine consumption 48 hour approximately 25 % reduction visual analog scale ( VAS ) pain score post anesthesia care unit 6 weeks.4 Although study provide evidence may reduction long-term postoperative pain , additional study need provide evidence effect sustain beyond 6-week period . We interested examine ketamine closely spine surgery patient population experience significant postoperative pain may difficult control due preoperative opioid use ( i.e. , opioid tolerance ) . The investigator choose study ACDF patient specifically common spine procedure throughout United States patient significant opioid requirement postoperatively . In study examine effect low dose ketamine postoperative IV PCA fentanyl cervical lumbar surgery , patient placebo group ( thus receive fentanyl PCA ) report mean VAS score 4-5 movement receive opioids.5 Further , previous study show opioid-sparing effect ketamine measure opioid consumption decrease pain measure VAS score , study knowledge examine quality recovery intraoperative ketamine infusion . The Quality recovery ( QoR-40 ) score develop Myles et al ass quality recovery anesthesia base forty question five dimensions,6 score show reliable valid outcome patient undergoing spine cranial surgery.7 QoR-40 also interest able provide global assessment possible benefit harm use ketamine patient simultaneously characterize detrimental side effect well positive benefit ketamine use infusion subanesthetic level ( study thus far show minimal side effect hallucination ) .1,4 Significance : Previous study show opioid-sparing effect ketamine , however research warrant patient whose pain may difficult control whether effect sustain . ACDF patient experience significant pain post-operatively , ketamine may improve quality recovery due opioid-sparing effect prevention chronic pain . Further , patient center outcome measure QoR-40 report literature ketamine , opioid spar anesthetic , administer . This study determine `` moderate '' dose ketamine beneficial detrimental recovery patient also whether improve long term patient function , presumably decrease central pain sensitization . In addition , study set stage RCT 's examine analgesic strategy cervical spine surgery patient ( i.e. , intraoperative lidocaine infusion , volatile anesthetic vs. propofol primary hypnotic , COX-2 inhibitor , pregabalin , etc. ) . The overall goal would develop multi-faceted regimen decrease postoperative inpatient opioid requirement patient may facilitate long term recovery . The research question : Does ketamine improve quality recovery 24 hour anterior cervical discectomy fusion ( ACDF ) ? The hypothesis : investigator hypothesize ketamine improve quality recovery ACDF surgery</brief_summary>
