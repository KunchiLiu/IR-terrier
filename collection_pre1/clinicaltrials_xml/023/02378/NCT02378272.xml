Design A cluster randomize control trial two group ( intervention control ) . Randomization level primary care center ( PCCs ) . Population study Patients age 18 visit one 20 different urban rural PCCs . Randomization All PCCs participate region without employ onsite mental health professional invite participate study . Around twenty practice match 10 block depression treatment practice , thereafter 1 practice block randomly assign receive care manager intervention program . Intervention At intervention practice , district nurse apply around 15-25 % work time care coordinator management care patient depression . Before patient recruitment begin , physician nurse/district nurse ( care manager ) participate session train provide clinical service ( patient information education patient 's preferred treatment , assessment patient 's depressive symptom regular telephone contact , follow visit etc ) .

BDI-II , EuroQoL-5D , Work Ability Instrument ( WAI ) Karasek Job strain Model , medication , treatment ( psychological , counsel , ) .

Outcome criterion Change : depression symptom ( BDI-II ) , work ability index ( WAI ) , Job strain ( Karasek ) , EQ-5D , QALYs baseline 3 6 month . Amount sick listing ( day , % ) , day labour lose . Statistical analysis Analysis covariance , control baseline value , use estimate overall treatment effectiveness ( difference score ) final follow-up . Subgroup analysis gender well age adjustment also perform . Power calculation The primary variable level depression ( measure BDI-II ) analyze ANCOVA model repeat measure . In order detect effect 3 unit difference two group , power 80 % significance level 10 % ( two-sided ) 200 patient need group ( 9 ) . The underlie assumption standard deviation group 10 unit , within-subject correlation 0.4 , within-cluster-correlation 0.1 , i.e . design effect 1.9 correct cluster analysis . Cost-effectiveness analysis A cost- effectiveness analysis ( CEA ) quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) measure effect perform . The region Västra Götaland proclaim interest study , financially support study .</detailed_description>
