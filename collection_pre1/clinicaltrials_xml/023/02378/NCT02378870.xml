	<brief_summary>This phase IIb study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled multi-center study evaluate efficacy tolerability Osteodex patient metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . Osteodex poly-bisphosphonate containing three know substance ; dextran , alendronate guanidine . The objective study evaluate relative change response marker bone metabolism ( B-ALP S-P1NP ) The follow objective also evaluate : overall survival , PSA response , response marker related bone metabolism ( S-CTX osteocalcin ) , safety , tolerability , pain quality life .</brief_summary>
