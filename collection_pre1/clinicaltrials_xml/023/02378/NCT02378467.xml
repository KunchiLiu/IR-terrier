	<detailed_description>A grow body evidence support importance intervention cystic fibrosis ( CF ) lung disease early childhood , order potentially delay prevent irreversible lung damage . Yet , aside antimicrobial therapy , CF community clinical trial evidence base guide chronic pulmonary therapy preschool child . Hypertonic saline ( HS ) attractive chronic maintenance therapy investigate preschool child address defective mucociliary clearance , early step cascade event lead CF lung disease expect abnormal prior onset airway infection inflammation . Based several study , HS appear safe child le 6 year age , effectiveness difficult measure . In previous study ( ISIS ) , child le 6 year old receive HS number lung infection child receive control treatment . However , investigator think child young need sensitive test , lung function testing , see HS work prevent lung damage . Multiple Breath Washout ( MBW ) relatively easy lung function test perform preschool child . It calculate measurement call Lung Clearance Index ( LCI ) , sensitive measure airway inhomogeneity . In sub-study ISIS study 25 child , LCI improve child inhale HS twice daily 48 week . This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , control , parallel group trial assess LCI child CF age 3 5 enrollment . Participants randomize 1:1 receive 7 % HS ( treatment arm ) vs. 0.9 % isotonic saline ( control arm ) administer twice daily via jet nebulizer 48 week . Study visit occur Screening , Enrollment , Weeks 12 , 24 , 36 48 . Contact parent legal guardian ass adherence interim medical history occur 1 , 4 8 week enrollment quarterly subsequent study visit . Except screen visit , study visit occur quarterly basis . Total duration participation 52 week . As enrollment occur approximately 18 month , total duration study expect 30 month ( 18 month enrollment plus 12 month last participant complete study participation ) .</detailed_description>
