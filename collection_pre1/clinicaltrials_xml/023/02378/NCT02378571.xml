	<brief_title>Medication Adherence Telemonitoring Reduce Heart Failure Readmissions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately one four patient hospitalized heart failure readmitted within 30 day discharge 50 % readmitted within 6 month discharge . Heart failure admission major contributor enormous health care cost associate heart failure . Thus far , identification effective intervention prevent unnecessary readmission remain elusive . As result , press need identify novel , cost-effective approach reduce heart failure readmission . A grow body research suggest poor adherence heart failure medication major reason preventable heart failure readmission . In particular , loop diuretic medication essential prevent cardiopulmonary system become overload . Patients recently hospitalize may especially vulnerable adherence problem result stress recent hospitalization commonly induce sleep deprivation , nutritional deficiency , physical deconditioning , cognitive impairment , even delirium . Recent advance wireless health enable u remotely , unobtrusively , objectively monitor adherence heart failure medication post-discharge period . Early identification non-adherence loop diuretic medication prevention prevent volume overload state lead heart failure readmission . As patient non-adherent loop diuretic may also non-adherent recommended self-management behavior , early identification medication nonadherence may provide context identify gap self-management . To test hypothesis feasible conduct randomize trial wireless , medication adherence monitoring feedback patient clinician , investigator enroll 40 patient hospitalized heart failure discharge diuretic medication . Patients randomize 1 ) usual heart failure care + telemonitoring adherence diuretic medication ( INT ) ; N=20 2 ) usual heart failure care ( CTR ) ; N=20 . All patient ask take diuretic medication standard pill bottle cover electronic pill cap ( GlowCap ) , patient assign intervention arm adherence telemonitored study clinician real-time . Patients adherence medication measure fashion 30 day discharge . Patients contact 30 day determine hospitalize collect self-reported outcome data .</detailed_description>
