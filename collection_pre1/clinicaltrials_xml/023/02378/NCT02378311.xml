	<brief_title>Handlebar Grip Related Injury Prevention ( GRIP ) Study : Are Exposed Metal Handlebar Ends Risk Factor Injury ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Injuries common cause death child age 1-14 year European Union [ 11 ] . In United States cyclist injury 3rd common mechanism injury 7-13 year old , motor vehicle collision ( MVC ) fall [ 1 ] . Bicycle injury remain one common cause paediatric abdominal trauma 60 year [ 2,3 ] . The vast majority ( 95-98 % ) child cyclist admit due abdominal trauma 5 year old [ 2,3 ] . As mechanisms injury , boys injure frequently girl . Around three quarter injured child cyclist boys [ 12 ] . In recent UK study , handlebar end impact mechanism frequently result major intra-abdominal trauma child . Impact handlebar end implicate 29 % case . This ahead fall ( 20 % ) , pedestrian ( 8 % ) MVC occupant ( 8 % ) [ 3 ] . A study conduct Australia find 15 % child cyclist injury involve impact handlebar , 10 % child cyclist injury abdominal handlebar injury [ 4 ] . A study Philadelphia find 8 % paediatric bicycle-related trauma admission involve handlebar impact abdomen result injury Abbreviated Injury Scale ( AIS ) score 2 great [ 13 ] . The majority handlebar injury case series report literature relate child 's abdominal injury . The peak incidence occur 6 14 year age [ 4 ] . However , adult also sustain serious handlebar relate injury [ 14-16 ] 36 % handlebar injured patient sustain extra-abdominal injury [ 4 ] . It pedal cyclist risk injury . Incidents also involve non-motorized kick scooter , moto-cross bike , motorbike quad bike [ 3,4 ] . Crash investigation find serious handlebar injury often occur apparently minor incident ; unique rider perform stunt rid BMX bike [ 5,6 ] . There typical sequence event common many handlebar injury [ 5 ] . The child lose control bike begin fall . The front wheel rotate 90 degree perpendicular child 's body . The child continue fall forward , land upturned handlebar end . Children 's bike scooter often damage rubber grip expose metal handlebar end . This occur day-to-day use . Each time child drop bike scooter side , handlebar end contact ground . When , metal tube inside rubber grip cut rubber . With time , circle cut rubber end , expose metal pipe within . Handlebar end injury occur handlebar end expose intact . Two study 1990s look condition handlebar end implicate injury [ 5,6 ] . Acton et al publish series 21 patient report handlebar impact cause injury . Re-interview find metal handlebar end expose bike 10 child sustain major abdominal injury , whilst expose handlebar end present one bike 8 respondent minor abdominal injury [ 6 ] . Winston et al include detailed analysis 4 rider sustain serious abdominal injury due land handlebar end . They find serious injury occur 3 rider despite presence protective rubber cover handlebar end . The rider impact exposed metal handlebar end , however , particularly serious injury . He 6-year-old boy sustain life threaten liver laceration [ 5 ] . Identifying association condition handlebar grip likelihood sustain injury ultimate aim main GRIP study . This feasibility study aim test intend methodology prior roll nationwide multicentre study . The feasibility study allow power calculation perform nationwide study . The primary outcome nationwide study address whether child fall onto expose metal handlebar end great risk sustain injury fall onto handlebar intact rubber grip . A sub-study explore whether relationship injury severity grip condition . Our clinical experience tell u serious handlebar injury occur even handlebar grip intact . The investigator also know anecdotes rider fall onto handlebar end never attend hospital injury minor injury sustain . The case present tertiary paediatric unit represent 'tip iceberg ' . A study accurately identify number child fall onto handlebar present hospital unlikely feasible . This investigator design case-controlled study . If nationwide multicentre GRIP study reject null hypothesis , investigator focus passive injury prevention strategy relate handlebar end . There two aspect could easily address safety standard . Grip durability grip end minimum diameter . Improved durability reduce number bike scooter circulation expose metal handlebar end . Larger diameter end distribute end-on impact large surface area hence reduce pressure exert point contact . Currently one many applicable European safety standard include drop test handlebar grip durability [ 9 ] . This standard BMX bike introduce 2012 . However , drop test include recently publish standard Bicycles Young Children [ 10 ] . A minimum grip diameter requirement include standard Bicycles Young Children . It specify handlebars shall fit handlebar grip , grip shall resilient material shall enlarge covered end le 40mm diameter [ 10 ] . That standard applies bike suitable child around 5 year age . There minimum handlebar end diameter requirement apply bicycle ridden child 5 year age , kick scooter . These standard simply require handlebar fit handgrip end plug [ 7-9 ] . If , however , nationwide multicentre GRIP study accepts null hypothesis , investigator focus handlebar-related injury prevention complex mechanical solution steer limiter compressible handlebar end , design effective protective clothing . Some secondary outcome investigator propose address useful find expose handlebar end risk factor injury mechanism .</detailed_description>
