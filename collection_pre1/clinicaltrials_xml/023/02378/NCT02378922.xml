	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety feasibility infuse gene-modified , HIV-protected hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell ( HSPC ) high-dose chemotherapy treatment acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) -related lymphoma . II . To observe change gene-modified cell level antiviral treatment interruption . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate molecular clonal composition gene-modified cell hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) . II . To describe time disease progression , progression-free survival , treatment-related mortality , time neutrophil platelet recovery , incidence infection . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect procedure HIV-specific immune reconstitution . II . To observe effect HIV infection presence gene-marked cell determine deoxyribonucleic ( DNA ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . OUTLINE : CONDITIONING : Patients undergo high-dose chemotherapy chemoradiotherapy accord institutional guideline . STEM CELL INFUSION : Patients undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant LVsh5/C46 ( Cal-1 ) transduce autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell ( HSPC ) day 0 . Note : Patients continue receive highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) throughout treatment , 7-day break apheresis . Patients may eligible structured treatment interruption 12 week autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant gene-modified cell . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 15 year post-HCT .</detailed_description>
