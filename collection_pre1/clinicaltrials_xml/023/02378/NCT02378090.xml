	<brief_title>A Study Determine Causes Identify Increases Influenza-Like Illness ( ILI ) Mexico</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The La Red Network clinical site enroll individual present ILI symptom . A systematic sample choose across site , goal choose 3 subject outpatients 3 subject hospitalize every week site . It recognize , season low ILI activity , enrollment goal may achieve . To eligible selection , subject must willing sign inform consent , provide inform consent/assent case minor . Subjects follow period 28 day enrollment assess vital status . It estimate study enroll maximum 1872 subject per year approximate 7488 subject four year study propose enroll , depend upon extent ILI occur period study . Nasopharyngeal swab , sputum sample , blood sample obtain enrollment . The nasopharyngeal swab , adult &gt; 18 year age , portion blood serum peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain storage shipped central repository locate Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas Nutrición Salvador Zubirán respiratory pathogen test include real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) multiplex technique . All enrolled subject assess enrollment , 7 day ( +3 day ) 28 day ( +/- 5 day ) enrollment ass disease resolution vital status . The purpose study provide information regard pathogen cause ILI among patient seek care La Red Network site . The systematic collection data time allow determination seasonal pattern different etiologic agent ability early identification emergence particular virus , well ability identify change severity disease signal increase severity , hospitalization and/or death attributable specific pathogen . One important aspect influenza infection need identify genetic factor associate severity among patient present influenza develop severe disease . Subjects give option opt genetic test note informed consent form . This test limited study relate respiratory virus influenza , study design use genetic testing .
