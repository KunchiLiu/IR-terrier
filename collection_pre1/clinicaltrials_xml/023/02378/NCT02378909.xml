	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus one leading cause illness worldwide . Diabetes affect nerve , skin blood vessel . Diabetics problem patient nerve lose sense touch patient 's foot ( call neuropathy ) may unknowingly cause damage skin result skin loss 'ulcer ' . Diabetics also difficulty heal damage tissue especially patient diseased blood vessel cause lack blood area body include foot ( call ischaemia ) . Therefore diabetic great chance ulcer high chance heal . The loss protective skin barrier mean bacteria enter foot causing infection spread bone beyond . Ultimately result gangrene , amputation even death . Stem progenitor cell help repair replace damage body . Blood vessel key repair . Recent research suggest special progenitor cell find blood may responsible . They call Endothelial Progenitor Cells ( EPCs ) seem few number less effective repair diabetic . Current treatment diabetic wound always successful investigator need research look new treatment . One possibility use electrical stimulation nerve leg . Research study show may improve blood circulation heal wound . This research ass EPCs see link ulcer heal diabetic patient neuropathy ischaemia well . Furthermore investigator wish investigate whether electrical stimulation affect progenitor cell wound heal patient . The longterm goal research help diabetic patient improve quality life reduce wound relate complication</detailed_description>
