	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) major societal burden due high prevalence , poor prognosis high cost . A potential therapeutic target supply energy-starved heart . Lipid content heart highly dynamic myocardial lipid overload implicate pathophysiology cardiac disease . The measurement total creatine , crucial actor creatine kinase system , give insight energy storage buffer capacity heart . Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) imaging technique allow non-invasive biochemical analysis clinical set use routine MR scanner . It combine advantage inherently provide molecular information , free ionizing radiation , require administration external tracer . The objective 3-year project develop myocardial MRS , particular lipid ( triglyceride ) creatine resonance , image biomarkers patient heart failure ( HF ) . Investigators elucidate , extent , lipid creatine level heart contribute heart failure . The first year cross-sectional study . Investigators aim compare MRS normal subject stable HF patient recovery normal impaired ejection fraction ( EF ) . Total 60 subject enrol , 20 subject group . In 2nd 3rd year , investigator plan prospective longitudinal study 40 subject . Enrolled patient evaluated cardiac MRS three time point , i.e. , disease onset , 6 month one year treatment , follow end project ( 1.5~3-year follow ) . In total 120 MR scan perform 2nd 3rd year . The resonance cardiac MRS , include creatine lipid , correlate disease course , patient biochemistry data clinical outcome . Investigators expect make MRS become integral part clinical cardiac MR protocol . The advance knowledge prove association heart failure myocardial impairment lipid and/or creatine . The knowledge gain MRS could potentially translate non-invasive biomarker heart failure patient . This biomarker help early detect treatable cause HF , monitor evaluate treatment response non-invasive fashion . The inherited non-invasiveness non-radiation nature make MR ideal technique clinical application biotechnology development .</detailed_description>
