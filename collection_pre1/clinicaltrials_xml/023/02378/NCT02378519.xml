	<detailed_description>Purpose The aim study evaluate effect multimodal treatment web-based self-help program cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) coach individual tailor physiotherapy workability , health behavior pain symptom person persistent pain . Design In study , apply Single Subject Experimental Design ( SSED ) six week baseline phase , 16 week intervention phase six week follow-up phase twelve month . Outcome measurement perform regularly phase . Participants Approximately 12 participant , fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion include study . Inclusion criterion : Persons , persistent recurrent pain neck-shoulder back , duration least three month , age 18-63 year , score ≥ 90 Linton´s questionnaire , indicate risk continuous sick leave development persistent pain , disposable labor market least 25 % eligible study . The participant fluent Swedish language . Exclusion criterion : Patients dementia and/or restrict cognitive functioning . Persons depression and/or anxiety . The latter screen Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale questionnaire . Terminally ill patient , comorbidity might prevent treatment participation ongoing causal treatment , identify drug abuse , retirement pension ongoing pregnancy , patient lack internet attach computer home . Ethical consideration The Ethical application Regional Ethical Review Board Umeå . Procedure The study conduct collaboration local physiotherapy unit primary health care . We actively recruit participant advertise local medium . Participants recruit advertisement local medium . Each person answer advert get contact one researcher , give initial information study make appointment screen assessment whether person equivalent study 's inclusion exclusion criterion . Written information write consent obtain participant include study . Intervention The participant include study randomize one two group . The study begin one group start baseline phase 8 week introduce web-based self-help program group baseline phase 6 week without intervention . During baseline phase , participant answer questionnaire outcome variable /week . This provide researcher . The intervention consist web-based self-help program cognitive behavioral therapy coach combination individually tailor physiotherapy accord person 's need 16 week . All participant receive interactive web-based self-help pain program coaching use CBT-principles individual coaching provided.One researcher introduce participant web-program . . A trained CBT-coach responsible coaching process intervention . The physiotherapy treatment deliver physiotherapy unit , individualized patient , multimodal treatment frequency duration depend patient 's need . Initially intervention , patient meet physiotherapist CBT-coach synchronize rehabilitation process accord patient 's needs goal . The web-based program The web-based program base CBT-principles , initially establish Livanda develop Norrbotten County Council Luleå University Technology ongoing REHSAM II-project . The web-program consists eight module comprise ; pain mechanism , activity balance health , physical activity ergonomics , emotions/ thought behavior , stress self-esteem , sleep , communication conflict , problem solve planning future . The web-program include informative text , interactive medium question reflection exercise perform . As example patient make activity plan also reflect priority life . The program also consist instructional video example ergonomics relaxation exercise . The patient opportunity play active role web-program , well interaction CBT-coach . The aim program increase patient 's knowledge understanding , supply tool cop life-situation increase health work-ability . The coaching process Within program participant formulate goal accord his/her individual pain rehabilitation need contact coach . The stepwise coaching process aim fulfill patient 's individually formulate goal . The CBT-coach supportive role guide patient program rehabilitation use CBT-principles . Outcome variable Primary outcome variable measure week phase single subject experimental phase . Self-perceived workability . This assessed use self-rated questionnaire Work Ability Index . By complement outcome variable Days sick leave/activity compensation Work Ability Index minimize risk type II-error due local labor market condition . Pain intensity . Average pain intensity last 7 day musculoskeletal system measure Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) . Self-efficacy relation pain measure Arthritis Self-efficacy scale ( ASES : S ) ; perceive capacity relation pain perceive capacity relation symptom . Considering association pain-related fear self-reported occupational disability , kinesiophobia relation pain measure Swedish version Tampa Scale Kinesiophobia . Health related quality life . The Swedish version RAND-36 use . Also , Patient Specific Functional Scale ( PSFS ) use identify measure activity rat important participant . Analyses The design imply study clinical progress control experimental manipulation frequent measurement several outcome variable small sample participant pre-intervention phase , intervention phase intervention withdrawal phase . 6 month intervention phase . The participant thereby act control see single system analysis . The analysis focus change level , trend variability outcome variable attribute introduction intervention . Line graph use describe progress variable study phase participant , visual analysis enhance calculation celeration line variability band . The design produce direct statistical inference , power describe clinical progress detail several individual . Similarities individual imply certain transferability result . The merit design additional tool traditional group design development evidence base practice describe recent review.The design also allow complementary analysis regard instance qualitative quantitative data implementation intervention , experience intervention participant therapist , cost , etc . This , together analyse outcome variable , provide valuable knowledge regard implementation clinic . Following SSED design data analyze individual level . For participant , line graph display outcome variable change along measurement occasion throughout baseline intervention phase . Analyses make follow . 1 . A visual analysis whether change level change slope outcome variable could attribute introduction intervention . These analysis complement follow calculation : 2 . Calculation +/-2SD band mean value baseline phase . This used order determine whether change level ( late part ) intervention phase could see statistically significant consider variation baseline phase . This make either determine mean value ( late part ) intervention phase within +/- 2SD band , check least 3 individual measurement intervention phase outside band . 3 . Calculation celeration line . This make complement analysis change trend ( slope ) outcome value throughout phase . For baseline intervention phase , celeration line draw median value first second half phase extend throughout phase . The slopes line compare whether differ substantially . Complementary data Complementary data collect within project activity logs web-based program ( participant coach ) ; number coaching session number physiotherapy session . In addition , qualitative data interview participant , coach physiotherapist regard e.g . experience process result intervention collect .</detailed_description>
