	<brief_summary>Chronic renal failure syndrome renal function decrease , patient number increase . In addition , patient dialysis also increase . Depending chronic renal failure aggravate , deterioration life cause conduct dialysis patient cause . In addition , problem dialysis treatment ongoing economic burden surface increase life patient family . A solution problem , stop progression chronic renal failure prior dialysis , necessary delay . As treatment inhibit progression chronic renal failure present , along diet blood pressure-lowering drug drug therapy use kremezin . However , effect enough , new drug development require . HD-003 novel compound , find inhibit renal failure progression . It find search active substance appear inflammation animal . The investigator confirm substance present urine person study , later establish link kidney disease hypothesis . When perform test animal model renal failure , chronic renal Through non-clinical test HD-003 ( general toxicity study , reproductive , developmental toxicity test , mutagenicity test antigen test ) show low toxicity . When go review safety pharmacokinetic Phase 1 clinical study , confirm satisfactory safety tolerability . And pharmacokinetic result body 's absorption healthy subject do well , linear correlation observe . Finally , confirm rapidly excrete urine . This study Phase 2a clinical trial perform patient chronic renal failure 3 , 4 step . The evaluation change serum creatinine ( sCr ) vivo indicator renal failure accord progress . Evaluating inhibitory effect HD-003 renal failure progression dose setting , determine safety .</brief_summary>
