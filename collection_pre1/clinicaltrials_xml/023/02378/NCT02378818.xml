	<brief_title>Characterization Motivational Deficit Schizophrenia Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator goal develop neuropsychological battery characterize different aspect motivation : energizing action , ability use clue assign value , ability anticipate reward delay time , finally learn trial / error base reward . In addition , investigator systematically compare effect reward punishment ( loss ) spot . Such systematic approach well understand nature disrupt schizophrenia process . It also highlight differential effect treatment , include effect conventional antipsychotic versus atypical antipsychotic , also benefit cognitive remediation . In depression : The motivational deficit heart depressive symptomatology . Our objective characterize motivational process alter depression thanks neuropsychological battery . Furthermore , clinical dimension could influence answer antidepressant treatment . A good characterization motivational deficit would allow adapt best pharmacological treatment use depression , particular target dopaminergic way , involve control motivation . The investigator recruit 35 patient 35 control subject population . The investigator make pas battery motivational test describe three half-days : - Force task : This task test energization process , say ability activate action proportion involve . It consist two session 60 trial , offset six level monetary issue ( 1 , 20 , 50 cent , 1 , 5 , 20 euro ) , last 30 minute . On trial , patient must tighten grip dynamometer order earn reward proportional level monetary issue peak force occur , avoid financial loss magnitude equal . The award task make subliminal condition supraliminal , condition mental effort use stroop test instead dynamometer . - Preference task : This task test integrity `` brain recovery system . '' It include three subtests quote 24 award , 24 penalty 24 effort , three subtests binary choice 48 trial , last 30 minute . Patients note various award seem pleasant , various punishment seem unpleasant , various effort seem harsh . Registration vegetative marker ( heart rate ) compare implied valuation explicit assessment ( note ) , thus estimate accuracy introspection . - Discount effort task : These task use estimate parameter time count effort punishment . In task counting time effort , patient must choose make small reward associate low time earn great reward associate significant delay . In task temporal punishment count , patient must choose experience low punishment short time , suffer great punishment large delay . These task capture form apathy characterize exaggeration fatigue pain early . - Learning task : It test overall learning ability specific sensitivity learn positive negative reinforcement . It consist two session , 60 binary choice ( 24 associate reward , punishment associate 24 , 12 associated neutral event ) , period 20 minute . The second session provide counterfactual condition .</detailed_description>
