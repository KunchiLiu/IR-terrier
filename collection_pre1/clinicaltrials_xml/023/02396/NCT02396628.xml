	<brief_summary>The preliminary data demonstrate potent activity Ruxolitinib steroid-refractory GvHD . The investigator therefore intend launch clinical phase 2 trial . In multicenter phase 2 trial investigator evaluate efficacy Ruxolitinib Steroid-refractory acute GvHD 15 transplantation center . The investigator evaluate response monitoring clinical GvHD grade , requirement alternative GvHD active agent serum level pro-inflammatory cytokine . Until , report GvHD patient treat JAK1/2 inhibitor investigator n't evidence coexist trial investigates activity JAK1/2 inhibitor GvHD</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The pathophysiological hallmark GvHD allo-HCT allogeneic donor T cell response recipient antigens . This process aggravate increase process presentation host antigen donor APCs follow conditioning treatment . The allogeneic T cell response lead inflammation , tissue damage fibrosis mediate extensive production inflammatory cytokine IL-1 , IL-2R , IL-6 TNF . The signal transmission inflammatory cytokine effector cell ( T- cell , macrophage , NK - cell ) require activation specialized kinase family Janus kinases . These kinase , JAK1 , 2 3 link cytokine receptor , activate upon bind cytokine receptor inflammatory effector . The JAK1/2 kinase inhibitor Ruxolitinib ( INC424 ) approve myelofibrosis . In advanced myelofibrosis , Ruxolitinib lead sustain clinical remission regard constitutional symptom , weight loss spleen size majority treat patient . Of note , clinical response correlate marked reduction inflammatory plasma cytokine . Importantly , cytokine down-regulated Ruxolitinib patient myelofibrosis correspond inflammatory effector mediate tissue damage inflammation GvHD . These mainly cytokines IL- 1 , IL -6 , TNF IFN-Î³ . Since Ruxolitinib suppress JAK1 / 2 cytokine response , investigator hypothesize Ruxolitinib might attenuate cytokine mediate inflammatory tissue damage GVHD thus might favourably affect severity course GvHD allo-HCT . In vitro , investigator demonstrate allogeneic system ( major mismatch mixed-lymphocyte reaction ) co-incubation Ruxolitinib strongly suppress proliferation allogeneic T cell production inflammatory cytokine . Using aggressive major mismatch mouse model acute GvHD ( C57BL/6 BALBc ) Ruxolitinib treatment significantly prolong survival animal . In addition , animal show reduced weight loss , significantly reduce histopathological GvHD severity , suppression inflammatory cytokine serum reduction donor T cell GvHD target organ intestine . Sole suppression cytokine production cytokine receptor activity Ruxolitinib would similar already establish drug GvHD major conceptual advance . However investigator observe Ruxolitinib suppress cytokine production also lead increased frequency FoxP3+ regulatory T cell . This cell type previously show lead long-lasting tolerance compare short-term immunosuppression achieve conventional medication GvHD .</detailed_description>
