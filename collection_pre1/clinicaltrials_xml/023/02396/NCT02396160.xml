	<brief_title>The Effect Urox™ Treatment Overactive Bladder Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initial consultation hold either Brisbane campus Endeavour College Natural Medicine Naturopathic clinic Kelvin Grove Natural Medicine clinic , Brisbane . Follow interview conduct via telephone . To minimize dropout rate , participant telephone ( reminder call complete micturition diary ) approximately 1 week schedule interview time intermittently call week follow unable reach schedule interview time . Three attend clinician interview trial participant , participate interview training prior interview take . The training design ensure utility uniform consistent approach regard question ask data record . The week prior initial consultation participant request complete micturition diary health relate quality life survey , serve baseline measure . The attend clinician also complete clinical data sheet , time initial consultation , contain range question include demographic , exercise , health history habit , use control correlate data variable . Any incomplete quality life survey outset also complete first interview . Micturition diary collect post 2 , 4 8 week interval along completion quality life survey follow clinical data sheet via telephone . Participants ask keep micturition diary 3 day prior consultation provide reply pay envelop return survey unused capsule assess compliance . For primary outcome ( day frequency ) measure calculate 90 participant equally divide placebo control require detect difference 1.6 urinary frequency episode per day ( 2.7SD ) treatment placebo group , two-tailed alpha 0.05 power 80 % . For total incontinence , 53 participant require equally divide group detect difference 1.2 episode per day ( 2.2SD ) , urgency 54 require group detect difference 2 per day ( 3.7SD ) . To account potential drop-outs variation present symptom , total 150 participant recruit . Data two treatment compare use mixed effect order logistic regression adjust repeat measure ( Stata , version 13.1 , StataCorp , TX , USA ) . GraphPad Prism ( version 6.00 Windows , GraphPad Software , La Jolla California , USA ) use plot data . Data ( day frequency , night frequency , urgency incontinence ) evaluate intention treat analysis , last result bring forward people drop lose follow-up . Variables select adjustment use backward stepwise regression list include age , sex , water intake diuretic use ( p &lt; 0.22 covariate inclusion ) . Holm estimation test use adjust p-values repeat measure . Each analysis include participant symptomatic baseline . For example , relation daytime urinary frequency - participant baseline ≥10 include analysis .</detailed_description>
