	<brief_summary>Cardiac resynchronisation therapy ( CRT ) prolong life improves symptoms patient heart failure electrical dyssynchrony . 30-50 % patient improve treatment expensive without complication . Despite much research , accurately predict respond . Furthermore , heart failure patient get symptom exercise study examine patient rest . We propose investigate effect exercise different part leave ventricle sample various biomarkers metabolism , myocardial injury gene expression . We repeat protocol follow device insertion look change . This novel work require small cohort patient heart failure electrical dyssynchrony normal patient act control . We also measure novel biomarkers different venous site relate different part myocardium determine whether use prognosticate even predict response CRT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selective Coronary Vein Sampling Left Bundle Branch Block CRT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose examine acute effect exercise patient dyssynchronous electrical activation heart heart failure compare release novel biomarkers selective area coronary venous drainage direct cannulation different vein via coronary sinus ( CS ) . The study design separate patient minimally invasive arm ( MINARM ) invasive arm ( INARM ) . The INARM recruit patient MINARM . MINARM Group 1 : 40 patient schedule CRT implant Group 2 : 15 patient heart failure dyssynchrony Group 3 : 15 patient normal heart Group 1 : 40 patient undergo CRT venous sample take CS , two CS tributary , peripheral venous peripheral arterial site time CRT insertion time device implant . Blood sample analyse metabolite novel biomarkers They undergo repeat sample 6 month assess change micro RNA biomarker profile include CS sampling . Group 2 3 A control arm 15 patient heart failure dyssynchrony ( Group 2 ) 15 patient normal heart ( Group 3 ) undergo peripheral venous sample biomarkers repeat 6 month . These sample allow control dyssynchronous heart failure group also temporal change micro RNA expression . 10 patient Group 1 5 Group 2 3 invited part INARM time recruitment . INARM study Methods : GROUP A 10 pt heart failure dyssynchronous ventricular contraction GROUP B 5 pt heart failure electrical dyssynchrony schedule either coronary angiography electrophysiology study . GROUP C 5 pt schedule diagnostic coronary angiography electrophysiology study normal cardiac function The exact detail protocol vary depend upon Group : GROUP A 1 On day precede CRT implant attend hospital temporary invasive catheter study . A pacing protocol perform use pace wire insert right atrium . Coronary sinus venous blood sampling perform use catheter place via femoral internal jugular vein . At chief investigator 's discretion specially design exercise bicycle allow supine exercise catheter lab use rather atrial pacing wire . 3 6 month post implant patient return catheter laboratory study . This repeat protocol device 6 month . This require arterial access describe . This study take approximately hour . GROUP B C It common practice patient coronary angiogram exclude ischaemic heart disease cause heart failure chest pain electrophysiology study determine mechanism arrhythmia . If angiogram normal , perform pacing protocol ( require attend electrophysiology study ) . This require 2 femoral venous access site ( similar standard electrophysiological study ) allow temporary atrial pacing acquisition blood sample coronary sinus . Following invasive part study patient Group B C fall back Group 2 3 MINARM attend 6 month peripheral blood sampling .</detailed_description>
