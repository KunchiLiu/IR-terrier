	<brief_summary>Triac Trial II ass effect Triac therapy several neurocognitive end-points patient Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome ( AHDS ) . Patients AHDS suffer severe psychomotor retardation . A mutation TH transporter protein Monocarboxylate transporter 8 ( MCT8 ) result reduce thyroid hormone ( TH ) level de brain , lead impaired neuronal differentiation . The severe neurological phenotype accompany increase T3 level blood , result variety thyrotoxic symptom tachycardia , increase metabolism , weight loss low muscle mass . Currently , Triac Trial I ( NCT02060474 ) investigate Triac treatment AHDS patient reduce toxic effect high T3 level . In addition , safety Triac administration AHDS patient assess . In Triac Trial II focus effect Triac neurocognitive development .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triac Trial II MCT8 Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This therapeutical trial conduct patient Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome ( AHDS ) , due mutation MCT8 . MCT8 thyroid hormone ( TH ) transporter crucial transport TH blood different tissue . Dysfunction MCT8 result lack TH ( hypothyroidism ) tissue depend MCT8 TH uptake . This local hypothyroidism brain patient cause severe psychomotor retardation . In addition , TH serum parameter highly abnormal AHDS : high T3 , low T4 normal TSH level . The high serum T3 level cause local hyperthyroidism tissue depend MCT8 cellular transport TH , result low body weight reduce muscle mass . Currently , adequate treatment available AHDS . A T3 analog depend MCT8 cellular entry could , least partially , restore abnormality find AHDS . Several vivo , vitro animal study show T3 analog Triac promising candidate : 1 . Triac bind TH receptor T3 ; 2 . Cellular uptake Triac depend functional MCT8 . Hence , AHDS patient Triac also available tissue require functional MCT8 TH uptake , e.g . brain ; 3 . In vitro study show neuronal cell differentiate equally well presence either Triac T3 ; 4 . In Mct8 deficient mouse , Triac take brain suppresses serum TSH level ; consequently , serum T3 T4 level lower ; 5 . Triac treatment choice patient resistance thyroid hormone ( RTH ) syndrome . Patient RTH high serum TSH thyroid hormone level , show strong similarity profile find AHDS patient ; longstanding experience Triac RTH indicate safety tolerability . Thus , Triac treatment could result normalization abnormal serum TH value AHDS patient . Furthermore , Triac could replace function T3 tissue depend MCT8 TH uptake ( e.g . brain ) . Currently , Triac Trial I ( NCT02060474 ) investigate Triac treatment AHDS patient reduce toxic effect high T3 level monitor Triac may restore local TH deficiency brain . The main purpose Triac Trial I evaluate effect Triac peripheral phenotype . The current Trial ( Triac Trial II ) investigate Triac treatment AHDS patient improve neurocognitive phenotype .</detailed_description>
