	<detailed_description>The clinical , biological functional endpoint measure study ( `` smoker 's health profile '' ) may characterize modification risk smoking-related disease . Clinical risk endpoint assess select base ) association smoking-related disease b ) association smoking status , c ) reversibility upon smoke cessation , ) suitability measure valid robust method clinical study . The biological marker , functional marker biomarkers exposure ( BoExp ) strong scientific evidence constitute 'smoker 's health profile ' measure primary objective study . Additional endpoint involve mechanistic smoking-related disease study provide additional scientific evidence strengthen primary objective . The study provide perspective product usage `` real world set '' smoke CC addition THS 2.2 may expect .</detailed_description>
