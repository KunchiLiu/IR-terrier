	<detailed_description>Breast cancer lead cause cancer death among woman worldwide , approximately 800 , 000 breast cancer death annually project occur 2030 globally [ 1 ] . Activation over-expression oncogene encode trans-membrane receptor tyrosine kinases epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) family , include ErbB1 ( also know HER1/EGFR ) ErbB2 ( also know human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2 ) , play important role development breast cancer . Overexpression HER2 show poor prognostic indicator associate increase relapse rate poorer overall survival breast cancer . Several therapeutic strategy develop block HER2 signaling pathway order improve treatment breast cancer . Trastuzumab recombinant , humanize , monoclonal antibody bind extracellular domain HER2 protein . Treatment trastuzumab improves outcome woman HER2 over-expressing early stage metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) [ 3 , 4 ] . The current standard care stage I-III HER2-positive breast cancer patient addition 1 year adjuvant trastuzumab chemotherapy [ 5 ] . This result 40-50 % improvement 5- year disease-free survival ( DFS ) , 30 % improvement 5-year overall survival ( OS ) chemotherapy alone . Preoperative ( primary neoadjuvant ) chemotherapy standard therapy patient locally advance breast cancer , increasingly used patient operable breast cancer [ 15 ] . Randomised trial compare preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy early operable breast cancer demonstrate preoperative chemotherapy several potential advantage adjuvant approach . It significantly increase rate breast conserving surgery mastectomy . Pathological complete response follow preoperative chemotherapy breast lymph node significantly predict well patient survival . Furthermore , preoperative chemotherapy associate few adverse event ( AEs ) [ 16 , 17 ] . These data prompt increase use preoperative chemotherapy patient operable breast cancer . Given increasingly important role anti-HER2 therapy early advanced stage HER2-positive breast cancer , aim expand current therapeutic option develop efficacious tolerable combination chemotherapy target therapy . In neoadjuvant setting , addition trastuzumab chemotherapy report result 2-3 fold increase pCR rate operable HER2-positive breast cancer [ 18 ] . However , optimal neoadjuvant regimen early stage HER2-positive breast cancer yet define . We recently complete phase II study neoadjuvant weekly paclitaxel carboplatin combination lapatinib patient stage I-III HER2-positive breast cancer . Pathologic complete response rate lower expect ( 11.1 % ) due high proportion locally advanced tumour . In addition , dose interruption reduction common , dose intensity difficult maintain . Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity occur 19.4 % common toxicity ( ¬ &gt; 20 % ) include diarrhea ( 80 % ) , peripheral neuropathy ( 65.7 % ) , rash ( 57.1 % ) , nausea ( 40 % ) , fatigue ( 40 % ) , vomit ( 34.3 % ) , non-neutropenic infection ( 25 % ) transaminitis ( 22.8 % ) [ 19 ] . ASLAN001 small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor HER1 , HER2 , HER4 . Preclinical data show ASLAN001 potent lapatinib neratinib inhibit HER1 HER2 , early phase clinical study demonstrate superior pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamic target inhibition compare lapatinib . Furthermore , ASLAN001 demonstrate good safety profile lapatinib early phase study . We hypothesize novel combination ASLAN001 weekly paclitaxel/carboplatin induce favorable pathological complete response ( least 30 % ) stage I-III HER2 positive breast cancer , favourable safety profile lapatinib combine paclitaxel/carboplatin . All patient receive 1 year adjuvant trastuzumab follow completion anthracycline-containing chemotherapy post-operatively , accordance standard practice .</detailed_description>
