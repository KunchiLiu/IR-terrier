	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine addition antiplatelet therapy ( i.e . aspirin ) low-molecular-weight-heparin ( i.e . enoxaparin ) decrease incidence venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) high-risk critically injured patient . The investigator aim determine safety efficacy dual thromboprophylaxis aspirin enoxaparin decrease incidence VTE trauma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aspirin Enoxaparin VTE Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , control , open-label clinical trial evaluate effect dual thromboprophylaxis enoxaparin aspirin versus enoxaparin alone incidence VTE trauma patient . Once trauma patient admit Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) , study personnel screen entry criterion , eligible , obtain informed consent patient healthcare proxy . After informed consent , subject randomize one 2 group receive either standard care enoxaparin alone ( control group ) dual thromboprophylaxis enoxaparin plus aspirin ( intervention group ) . Alternative thromboprophylaxis permit prior consent randomization anytime discretion attend physician reason . Standard drug dosage use ( enoxaparin 30 mg subcutaneous twice daily ; aspirin 81 mg oral daily ) . All consented subject follow admission discharge hospital . Data collection include demographic information , injury pattern , mechanism injury , need surgical intervention , admission daily laboratory value ( e.g . basic metabolic profile , complete blood count , coagulation study , ROTEM ) , weekly venous duplex ultrasonography ( VDU ) , admission subsequent radiologic examination , medication administration record ( include miss dos thromboprophylaxis ) , outcomes measure ( complication , VTE , mortality ) . Blood sample complete blood count coagulation study order medically necessary per primary team ; ROTEM sample take pre-prophylaxis post-prophylaxis run Trauma Research Office . The amount drawn exceed less 50 ml 3 ml per kg 8 week period collection occur frequently 2 time per week . All clinical care discretion attend physician . Should attend physician choose change thromboprophylaxis medication , permit study include data collection . Discontinuation thromboprophylaxis generally occur standardized fashion patient fully ambulatory ; however , attend physician stray regimen , permit study part data collection . For patient admit ICU eligible study participation , routine measure already obtain clinical staff collected/calculated .</detailed_description>
