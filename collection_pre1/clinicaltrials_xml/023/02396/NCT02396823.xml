	<brief_summary>The propose study design answer novel research question : Can resistive respiratory muscle training design improve respiratory motor control also improve blood pressure regulation impair spinal cord injury ? Resistive breathing exercise , respiratory muscle training , apply rehabilitate breathe spinal cord injury , evaluate method increase rest blood pressure / improve regulation stress plan propose project . For first time , respiratory muscle training intervention use tool investigate physiological relationship pulmonary cardiovascular function individual Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) . Thus , foster new direction address neglect issue surround cardiovascular complication spinal cord injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening : To aid determine eligibility , participant respiratory cardiovascular function test . The participant also ASIA ( American Spinal Injury Association ) exam grade degree level SCI . Enrollment : Following screen process , consent recruiting , experimental recording : 1 . Pulmonary Function Test- This test measure lung volume , airflow airway pressure standard equipment ; 2 . Respiratory Motor Control Assessment- Pulmonary function test repeat participant sit special hospital bed lie back investigator record electrical impulse neck , chest , arm , leg , abdomen back muscle . These impulse record muscle contract . The investigator also record chest abdomen move place elastic belt around chest abdomen . Blood pressure measure use finger cuff ; 3 . Orthostatic stress test- Using method , investigator measure blood pressure , heart rate chest abdomen movement participant lie back position suddenly change sit investigator ' cardiac chair upright vertical position Tilt table . The investigator measure blood sample several interval small catheter insert vein arm . 4 . Ultrasound heart perform Respiratory Muscle Training ( RMT ) program . RMT : During train session , subject seat personal wheelchair approximately 45Â° head-up tilt nose clip . Standard threshold Positive Expiratory Pressure Device standard threshold Inspiratory Muscle Trainer combination use breathe adjustable resistance range 20 41 cm water . All device routine clinical use . These device assemble together use T-shaped connector flanged mouthpiece . The participant instruct perform inspiratory expiratory effort resistive load . During inhalation , subject instruct sustain effort lung feel full . During exhalation , subject instruct sustain effort lung feel empty . This study use two test-subject pre-training assessment session provide internal experimental group control . To match training period ( 4 week ) , pre-training assessment session perform four week apart measure parameter use establish variance untrained subject . The pulmonary function test include measurement lung volume , airflow , static mouth airway pressure use standard clinical method equipment SCI participant sit personal wheelchair . The investigator also record surface electromyogram ( sEMG ) activity trunk muscle Maximal Inspiratory Pressure ( PImax ) Maximal expiratory pressure ( PEmax ) measurements supine position ( PImax PEmax task ) . The investigator measure Sympathetic Skin Response ( SSR ) record limb skin resistance neural stimulation . The investigator ass beat-to-beat systemic blood pressure , heart rate cardiac output record orthostatic stress test . In addition , orthostatic stress test , investigator collect venous blood sample measure level catecholamine . In addition beat-to beat calculate , rest cardiac output measure ultrasonic cardiac echography . After initial test , participant assign RMT . The participant experimental group complete study 4 week train total 20 session 45 minute per day carry 5 day per week . The test battery repeat immediately complete train repeatedly follow-up period . Ten match control subject undergo procedure except training .</detailed_description>
