	<brief_title>Spillover Effects Water , Sanitation , Hygiene Interventions Child Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Almost 90 % diarrhea case 15 % under-5 diarrhea death worldwide could prevent improved water , sanitation , hygiene . Sanitation intervention also important prevention soil-transmitted helminth , infect 21 million child five year . Infection soil-transmitted helminth repeat episode diarrhea early life compromise physical cognitive growth development , result poor school performance later life . Thus , water , sanitation , hygiene ( WASH ) intervention important reduce child mortality , also prevent cycle poverty poor health . It possible WASH intervention affect receive also geographically proximate connect socially receive intervention . Indeed , large infectious disease model literature base premise . Investigators define intervention effect non-recipients `` spillover '' , often refer `` herd effect '' `` indirect effect '' . Most study empirically measure spillover child health intervention experimental design focus vaccine deworming , study measure spillover WASH intervention . The development application methodology measure spillover community intervention empirically would make valuable contribution field include epidemiology , economics , political science , social welfare , concerned measure impact program intervention may spill . The presence magnitude positive spillover important ; spillover present direction treatment effect account estimate treatment effect , estimate bias towards null . As result , efficacy cost effectiveness intervention underestimate . In study , investigator measure spillover water , sanitation , hygiene intervention exist , large , rigorously design trial : WASH Benefits trial ( http : //clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01590095 ) . Funded Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation , trial aim measure individual combined effect water , sanitation , hygiene intervention child health development . It cluster-randomized , controlled trial six treatment arm double-sized control arm carry rural Bangladesh . This add-on study fund National Institute Child Health Human Development ( 1R21HD076216-01A1 ) . Investigators hypothesize child live close proximity compound receive combine sanitation , handwashing , water treatment intervention -- compare child live close proximity control compound ( intervention ) -- : 1 ) low prevalence diarrhea , 2 ) low prevalence intensity infection soil transmit helminth , 3 ) low prevalence respiratory illness . Investigators collect additional data exist combine intervention ( sanitation+handwashing+water ) control arm WASH Benefits trial . For WASH Benefits household , investigator locate near household child 0-59 month age enrol WASH Benefits collect data household . Our primary outcome soil transmit helminth infection among child 0-59 month , caregiver-reported 7-day diarrhea , respiratory illness among child 0-59 month ( age WASH Benefits cohort ) . Our finding document either presence absence spillover combine sanitation+handwashing+water intervention .</detailed_description>
