	<brief_summary>The purpose study see use machine call CPAP help child asthma breathe well . CPAP machine produce airflow help people breathe problem . To use , wear mask connect hose CPAP machine . We believe use CPAP may treatment child asthma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modulation Of Airway Reactivity With Chronic Mechanical Strain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During previous funding period project , laboratory demonstrate chronic mechanical strain impose airway vivo use continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) result dramatic reduction airway reactivity vivo mouse , ferret rabbits1-3 . Lungs , airways airway smooth muscle ( ASM ) tissue isolate CPAP-treated animal study vitro exhibit low responsiveness bronchoconstrictors1-3 . We also observe suppression airway responsiveness chronic mechanical strain rabbit model allergic asthma5 . These animal study lead small clinical trial adult asthma treat nocturnal CPAP 1 week . CPAP cause significant reduction airway reactivity patients6 . This novel approach treat airway hyper-reactivity currently evaluate NIH multi-center Phase II clinical trial adult mild moderate asthma ( U01 HL108730 ) .</detailed_description>
