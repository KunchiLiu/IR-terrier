	<brief_title>Community Participation Transition After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose enhanced rehabilitation transition program : Community Participation Transition Stroke ( COMPASS ) compensatory intervention consist one pre-discharge five post-discharge home visit occupational therapist supplement usual care . This intervention focus resolve barrier independence daily activity participation use environmental support active practice daily activity individual 's real home ( versus idealize clinical setting ) . This new combination evidence-based compensatory treatment deliver novel treatment setting ( transition home ) . Our long-term goal development effective intervention transition home design prevent excess disability people live stroke could immediate effect high public health significance.16 We recruit 40 patient currently undergo inpatient rehabilitation ( IR ) ischemic stroke longitudinal study stroke Washington University School Medicine ( WUSM ) randomize receive six additional session enhance rehabilitation transition program attention control . Exploratory participation outcome assess blinded evaluator baseline , 6 month , 9 month , 12 month stroke . We test central hypothesis COMPASS acceptable , feasible , superior attention control measure participation daily activity performance 6 month stroke .</detailed_description>
