	<brief_summary>Background : Orthopaedic trauma lead cause long-lasting sick-leave persistent disability . People suffer persistent sick-leave often need vocational rehabilitation ( VR ) . Vocational program plan improve likelihood return work ( RTW ) . Physical conditioning , professional evaluation training , well psychological social intervention core treatment . Efficiency program moderate scope improvement . For instance , rehabilitation program tailor individual need potential call . However , allocation remain difficult . Decision-supportive tool may convenient achieve goal . Recently , WORRK model propose assess early risk non-returning work patient . The main goal research measure WORRK model improve patient ' allocation different vocational program accord `` non-return work '' risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Knowledge `` Non-return Work '' Predictive Score Influence Vocational Rehabilitation ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : Vocational inpatient orthopaedic trauma ( n=280 ) , age 18-60 year . Three different vocational pathway select : Simple ( patient low `` non-return work '' risk , 5 week stay ) , Coaching ( intermediate risk , 5 week ) , Evaluation ( high risk , 3 week ) . Design : randomized-controlled trial . In intervention group , probability return work estimate WORRK model offer clinician team allocation decision . In control group , probability also estimate known clinician team . The primary outcome proportion patient allocate Evaluation Pathway . Secondary outcome : patient ' satisfaction worse intervention group ; decision maker ' satisfaction information available decision process good intervention group ; proportion patient change treatment pathway vocational stay high intervention group ; calibration WORRK model remain satisfactory ; non-return work rate high intervention group control group ( follow-up 3 , 12 , 24 month ) ; Relevance impact : The investigator expect WORRK model improve efficiency vocational rehabilitation orthopedic trauma . This due good allocation vocational pathway accord patient ' risk profile . If case , increase shorter vocational program expect without jeopardize chance return work patient satisfaction quality care . The ability WORRK model detect patient similar risk profile could also strengthen interest decision-supportive tool clinical practice trial .</detailed_description>
