	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness esophageal transoral endoscopic circumferential resection ( TECR ) use extracellular matrix ( ECM ) placement treat Barrett 's esophagus patient high-grade dysplasia ( HGD ) . Endoscopic circumferential resection use ECM placement introduce less invasive , externally incision-less approach treat patient esophageal high grade dysplasia ; pre-cancerous condition . In procedure , entire length diseased ( abnormal ) mucosa ( esophagus lining ) remove use endoscope insert mouth . The ECM place area remove temporary , expandable stent prevent narrow esophagus . The stent use hold ECM place body begin heal process . This stent remove 14 day ( Â±4 day ) procedure . Follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopies ( EGD ) , barium swallow x-ray test , questionnaire take place 12 month follow procedure . The result study may help doctor determine procedure would effective treatment option HGD future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TECR &amp; ECM Placement Esophageal High Grade Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , prospective , single arm study involve 10 patient establish diagnosis Barrett 's Esophagus ( BE ) High Grade Dysplasia ( HGD ) . Potential subject prescreened assess eligibility must meet inclusion criterion . In order make initial qualification , pathology result biopsy EMR collect initial EGD make available Investigator prior patient consent . Following informed consent part routine care , potential participant undergo endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) PET/CT scan confirm lymph node involvement metastatic lesion prior procedure . Clinical data collect baseline assess subject ' medical status include : demographic , medical history , physical examination , vital sign , blood testing . Cardiac pulmonary clearance obtain need base medical history include chest x-ray , ECG , pulmonary function test . In addition , subject complete three questionnaire prior procedure : dysphagia severity questionnaire , SF-36 , GERD-HRQL . At time procedure , participant undergo TECR ECM placement use fully cover self-expanding metal stent temporarily hold ECM place . Prior hospital discharge , barium swallow test ( BaSW ) perform Day 1 follow study procedure evaluate passage contrast GEJ . If BaSW result suspicious finding esophageal perforation mucosal necrosis , upper endoscopy perform evaluation . The first primary safety endpoint study assess following procedure BaSW discharge hospital . At time point adverse event assess record . All subject undergo follow-up procedure , include questionnaire post-procedure EGDs perform Week 2 , Month 1 , Month 3 , Month 6 , Month 9 Month 12 visually assess tissue healing , recurrent disease , stricture formation present . Biopsies take follow-up EGDs pathology rule recurrence BE HGD . Subjects barium swallow x-ray Month 1 , Month 3 , Month 6 , Month 9 , Month 12 evaluate potential presence stricture formation . During Week 2 EGD , stent remove upper endoscopy . If time point subject dysphagia stricture formation ( 30 % reduction esophageal luminal diameter ) , routine dilation use balloon catheter perform EGD . Validated questionnaire include dysphagia severity questionnaire , SF-36 GERD-HRQL administer objectively assess severity symptom quality life base upon self-reported data . Additionally , adverse event assess record follow-up time point . After completion Month 12 visit , subject follow routine care basis Esophageal &amp; Lung Institute .</detailed_description>
