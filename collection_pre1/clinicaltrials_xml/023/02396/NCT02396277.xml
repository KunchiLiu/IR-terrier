	<brief_summary>Immobilization radius fracture seem increase risk develop Complex regional pain syndrome ( CRPS ) , condition associate pain , increase skin sensitivity reduce epidermal nerve density . The purpose study determine whether 5-week immobilisation lead functional structural sensory change , whether change associate persistent pain . The investigator plan explorative , pilot study six consent patient immobilised distal radius fracture . The baseline measurement record day day trauma : Demographics , psychological physical comorbidity , pain characteristic intensity , hand function , health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) , quantitative sensory test record skin biopsy analyze epidermal nerve fiber density . Following variable pain characteristic intensity , hand function , health relate quality life , quantitative sensory test skin biopsy reassess cast remove two month later .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Structural Functional Nerve Changes Following Immobilisation After Distal Radius Fracture - Pilot Study ( NRP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Distal radius fracture prevalent injury , affect 15.000 case Norway every year . About 5 % patient suffer longlasting pain develop serious chronic CRPS . Patients subjected hand surgery frequently report pain one month cast removal , examination reveal vascular trophic change , increase sensitivity pressure cold well elevate skin level proinflammatory mediator . Long term immobilization seem increase risk develop CRPS symptom . In Danish study healthy volunteer demonstrate increased hyperalgesia cold mechanical stimulus even 4-week immobilization may indicate early change nerve function . In CRPS patient skin biopsy demonstrate reduced epidermal nerve fiber density , data lack radius fracture early stage CRPS . The purpose explorative , observational , pilot study investigate whether radius fracture follow 5-week immobilization , lead functional structural change sensory system reverse remobilization whether sensory change associate persistent pain . Our hypothesis : 1 ) Patients immobilised arm follow radius fracture develops ) early cutaneous hypersensitivity ( hyperalgesia allodynia ) mechanical og thermal stimulus b ) reduce epidermal nerve fiber density . 2 ) The change sensory system reverse 2-month remobilization . 3 ) The functional structural change correlate patient report outcome measure ( PROM ) disability arm , shoulder hand ( DASH ) , pain intensity ( NRS ) , duration pain HRQOL . Eligible patient include throughout 2015 , result analyze within December 2015 . Measurements : Self report : Demographics ( age , gender , civil state , education , work status , social security benefit ) clinical data comorbidity , pain characteristic ( DN4 ) intensity ( NRS ) , blood pressure , smoke /other kind nicotine use , pain medication , assessment scale mental distress ( HSCL 25 ) , pain catastrophizing ( PCS ) , hand function ( DASH ) , HRQOL ( EQ5D ) . Examinations : Quantitative sensory testing ( tactile thermal stimulus ) skin biopsy carry 10 cm proximal fracture line dorsum affect arm . Measurements predictor analysis perform baseline outcome measurement perform prior removal cast well two month later . Statistical analysis : Regression analysis perform identify predictor change sensory nervous system include blood pressure , smoke /other kind nicotine use , medication , age , gender , comorbidity . Longitudinal analysis numerical outcome ( ANOVA repeat measurement ) carry outcome measurement pain intensity , hand function , HRQOL , sensory threshold epidermal nerve fiber density .</detailed_description>
