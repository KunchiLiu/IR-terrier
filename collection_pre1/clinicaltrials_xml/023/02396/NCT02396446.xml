	<brief_summary>This study conduct determine whether provider access patient ' acoustic intestinal rate score calculate abdominal acoustic sensor continuously monitor bowel sound ( AbStats ) likely advance patient ' diet solid diet sooner access rate . AbStats calculate intestinal rate use two small sensor place patient 's abdomen measure analyze abdominal sound . Patients ask wear sensor every morning 20 minute fast daily inpatient visit . The sensor measure sound within abdomen . This data interpret AbStats device , provide intestinal rate measurement base sound recorded sensor . This intestinal rate provide patient 's treat physician together vital sign . The doctor , his/her discretion , may choose use information make decision patient 's feeding status .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AbStats Bedside : Improving Patient Feeding Decisions Using Abdominal Acoustic Score</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research team use abdominal acoustic sensor continuously monitor bowel sound ( AbStats ) obtain acoustic measurement 50 Cedars-Sinai Medical Center ( CSMC ) hospital patient place disposable sensor abdomen . The sensor connect bedside monitor record sound collected sensor interprets create intestinal rate reading , measure acoustic event per minute . The research team enter score patient 's chart make available patient 's clinician ( ) , use discretion make decision whether advance patient 's diet base intestinal rate interpretation guideline previously develop . The entry provide numerical intestinal rate brief interpretation score list . This base interpretation measure provide AbStats bedside computer , previously develop wide research study.6 The score interpret use follow criterion : Fasting intestinal rate score &lt; 3 per minute : Ileus ; Consider hold diet advancement evidence GI function ( feed `` red light '' ) Fasting intestinal rate score 3-5 per minute : Slow motility ; Consider advance liquid diet NPO , assume otherwise medically surgically appropriate ( feed `` yellow light '' ) Fasting intestinal rate score &gt; 5 per minute : Normal motility ; consider advance full diet medically surgically appropriate ( feed `` green light '' ) Even though reading provide patient chart , physician must use clinical judgment account mental status , aspiration risk , medication , surgical medical comorbidities make feeding decision . The intestinal rate merely new piece information provide objective evidence GI function ; likely superior current best practice , notoriously unreliable truly determine GI functional status motility . The research team discus project patient 's medical teaching attend physician , request approval prior approach patient . Once doctor 's approval secure , researcher approach patient provide detailed information project activity . If agree participate , AbStats sensor place patient 's abdomen every morning 20 minute patient fast duration hospital stay . The sensor connect bedside computer process data calculate intestinal rate , appear AbStats ' gateway screen . The rate time-stamp enter patient 's CS-Link ( CSMC 's EHR ) chart research team . Once patient discharge , participation study complete . After discharge , patient 's chart review member research staff . Using `` Dietary Orders '' section `` Active Orders '' tab `` Patient Summary '' section patient CS-Link chart , determine length time fasting ( NPO ) full diet patient , X1-X0 , X1 time order full diet X0 time hospital admission note `` Encounters '' section patient chart . Full diet determine dietary order chart state `` Diet Regular '' . The time full diet report hour . Medical resident member Cedars-Sinai Department Health Services Research staff collect follow data ( measure ) patient 's bedside : Patient time ( hour ) advancement solid diet Abdominal intestinal rate measure AbStats disposable biosensor</detailed_description>
