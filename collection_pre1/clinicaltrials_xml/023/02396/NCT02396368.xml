	<brief_title>A Study Radium-223 Combination With Tasquinimod Bone-only Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Radium-223 combination Tasquinimod . The target population patient bone metastases castration-resistant prostate cancer intend treatment radium-223 . After baseline assessment , subject receive six cycle Radium-223 separate interval 28 day . Radium-223 administered per FDA-approved dosing ( six IV injection dose 50kBq/kg body weight , administer every 4 week ) . The treatment maintenance dose tasquinimod maximum 1 mg tasquinimod take daily water ( ~200 mL ) . The initial target dose tasquinimod 0.5mg/day . All subject follow 12 month start study treatment . The investigator propose phase I/Ib trial addition tasquinimod FDA-approved dos radium-223 men symptomatic bone-only metastatic CRPC . The investigator anticipate give distinct mechanisms action non-overlapping toxicity profile additive synergistic toxicity would minimal . The investigator hypothesize add tasquinimod radium therapy may result improved measure efficacy include reduction total alkaline phosphatase , time first skeletal-related event PSA radiographic progression-free survival . In Phase I portion dose-escalation scheme , dose escalation follow 3+3 design intra-patient dose-escalation 0.25mg/day tasquinimod goal dose either 0.25mg ( dose-level -1 ) , 0.5mg ( dose-level 1 ) , 1.0mg/day ( dose-level 2 ) base individual tolerability . Upon identify recommend Phase II combination dose-level Radium-223 tasquinimod , investigator move Phase Ib portion open expand cohort 35 additional patient achieve total 38 patient treat recommended phase II dose-level ( include dose-escalation phase ) .</detailed_description>
