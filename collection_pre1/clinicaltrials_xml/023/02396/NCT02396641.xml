	<detailed_description>Many cancer clinical trial design evaluate benefit experimental anticancer drug best supportive care ( BSC ) ; many drug register base modest survival advantage compare BSC . Universally across study , however , BSC control arm standardize across site way trialists strive standardize intervention clinical trial ; consistent contemporary palliative care practice ; base extensive best available evidence ; describe detail case certainly sufficient detail reproduce subsequent study . When report BSC trial incomplete , result data uncertain internal external validity . Such poorly define intervention variation sit unacceptable aspect clinical trial . Furthermore , poorly deliver BSC arm might systematically overestimate performance intervention arm ( ) study lead poor decision making clinician funders . With mount evidence early use supportive/palliative care improve patient outcome , incomplete delivery BSC might deprive patient considerable benefit , potentially set far less toxicity . In line CONSORT statement report clinical trial , propose study would seek generate consensus-based standard BSC definition ( allow update new evidence become available ) , operationalize measure outcomes clinical trial set . In , intend demonstrate : 1 ) feasibility thorough documentation BSC , delivery measurement clinical trial ; 2 ) improve quality life standardize BSC . Specifically term PCEOL research objective , study develop intervention design mitigate adverse physical psychological symptom outcomes focus especially begin end-of-life phase . This prospective , single arm consecutive cohort study oncologists patient . Initially , individual institutional best practice term supportive/palliative care delivery record across site ( control period ) . Two month study initiation , patient complete pre-intervention patient ESAS PNPC-sv assessment measure baseline care experience . At point , sit simultaneously switch behavioral modification intervention ( BSC checklist ; experimental period ) . From time forward , documentation supportive care delivery document via BSC checklist medical record review . At month four , physician acceptability patient experience evaluate .</detailed_description>
