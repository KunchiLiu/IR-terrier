	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Reducing Frequency Cytomegalovirus Events Patients With Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) peptide ( Pep ) vaccine ( Vax ) ( CMVpp65-A*0201 peptide vaccine ) reduce frequency CMV event define reactivation CMV disease human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) A*0201 allogeneic CMV positive hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HCT ) recipient ( HCT-R+ ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability CMVPepVax assess follow : non-relapse mortality ( NRM ) 100 day post HCT , severe ( grade 3-4 ) acute graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) ( aGVHD ) , grade 3-4 adverse event ( AEs ) ( Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events [ CTCAE ] 4.0 ) probably definitely related vaccination within 2 week vaccination . II . To characterize CMV reactivation CMV disease recipient CMVPepVax compare placebo assess time-to viremia ( defined number day transplantation date &gt; = 500 CMV genome copy [ gc ] /mL ) , duration viremia , recurrence viremia , incidence late CMV viremia/disease ( &gt; 100 = &lt; 360 day post HCT ) , use antiviral drug ( trigger clinically significant viremia &gt; = 1500 CMV genome copy [ gc ] /mL ) , cumulative number CMV specific antiviral treatment day . III . To evaluate impact CMVPepVax transplant relate outcomes assess incidence acute GVHD ( aGVHD ) , chronic GVHD ( cGVHD ) , relapse , non-relapse mortality , all-cause mortality , infection . IV . To determine CMVPepVax increase level , function kinetics CMV-specific T cell immunity vaccinate compare placebo treat HLA A*0201 , CMV seropositive HCT-recipients . V. To determine whether vaccination induces adaptive natural killer ( NK ) cell population change , increase highly cytotoxic memory NKG2C+ NK cell . VI . To explore GVHD biomarkers compare vaccine placebo group . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive CMVpp65-A*0201 peptide vaccine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 28 56 HCT . ARM II : Patients receive placebo SC day 28 56 HCT . After completion study treatment , patient follow day 365 HCT .</detailed_description>
