	<brief_title>Evaluating Feasibility Usability Exergames Stroke Patients With Visuo-spatial Neglect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Within REWIRE project , nine exergames develop treatment visuospatial neglect stroke . All exercise aim , accord classical rehabilitation , drive patient towards exploration hemi-neglected space . The Gentile 's taxonomy extend neglect patient use develop exergames . Gentile 's taxonomy motor skill allow simple complex progression skill enable determine progress objective basis . According specification , exergames target exploration space additional cognitive memory task increase difficulty level develop . This allow individual game selection suitable neglect patient 's cognitive skill guarantee constant learn process . The assessment virtual-reality base neglect train intervention stroke patient take place collaborate rehabilitation clinic Switzerland . The neglect training think additional therapy option regain functional independence together standard rehabilitation program patient follow inpatient stay clinic . The exergame neglect train intervention base widely accept motor learn train principle specificity , initial value , overload progression . Furthermore , intervention plan accord FITT component ; : Frequency , Intensity , Time Type training . The intervention characterize follow parameter : - Frequency : 5 session per week - Intensity : individually adjust treat therapist accord progress participate patient - Time : 30-45 minute per train 3 week - Type : REWIRE neglect exergames The assessment : Assessing cognition : Zürcher Maxi Mental Status Test ( ZüMAX ) The ZüMAX test perform interview situation get quick ( 30 min ) first assessment neuropsychological deficit suit also long term control . It provide reliable index follow domain : language , praxia , learn memory , perception visual-constructive ability well executive function . In five functional domain , maximum 6 point score ; obviously , total 30 point represent optimal functioning . In addition numerical scoring , ZüMAX allow also qualitative judgment individual 's alertness , ability cooperate , tempo emotion . The necessary equipment ZüMAX following : stopwatch , metronome , pencil patient ( ruler , eraser ) , 24 stimulus card ( chimerical face ) , ZüMAX test form one coversheet , seven demonstration sheet , four work sheet four record sheet . Its test-retest-reliability concurrent validity recently examine stroke population . Assessing eye movement : The Eye Tribe Tracker ( TETT ) To get good estimate game really influence exploration hemi-neglected space , eye movement track `` THE EYE TRIBE TRACKER '' ( TETT ) . It develop Copenhagen-based eye-tracking start-up company , The Eye Tribe . The company first category offer reliable , consumer-grade eye tracking product . The Eye Tribe tracker brand new sensor combine infrared illumination system provide best condition eye track algorithms work . The high resolution sensor ensure tiny movement pupil track high precision maintain wide field view . The advanced algorithm work tandem hardware optimize environment light condition . However , work best indoor scenario without direct sunlight device . Its operating range 45cm 75cm , track area 40cm x 30cm 65cm distance ( 30Hz ) . The participant perform adapt version ( use eye instead finger ) test develop Rabuffetti et al . This Neglect test consist uniform distribution 120 stimulus , either letter shape , include 40 target 80 distracters . Each participant seat front screen mid-sagittal plane trunk align center screen . The task consist look ( instead touch index finger ) target subject able detect . Once target look approximately 2 second , circle . In order avoid compensatory movement head , chin rest ( locate table front patient . This model individually adjustable height patient , produce hygienic material ( varnished wood , aluminium , polyester tissue ) regularly use optician vision training . The chin rest also use intervention play exergames . Assessing visuospatial neglect : Behavioral Inattention Test ( BIT , German : NET ) The standardized BIT consist six conventional subtests ( similar cancellation , bisection , copy measure ) nine behavioral subtests design identify wide variety visual neglect behavior . The conventional subtests follow : Letter Star Cancellation , Figure Shape Copying , Line Crossing Bisection Representational Drawing . The nine behavioral subtests instrument assess aspect daily life : Picture Scanning three picture ( plate food , bathroom sink , room ) , Telephone Dialing , Menu Reading ; Article Reading , Telling Setting Time , Coin Sorting , Address Sentence Copying , Map Navigation , Card Sorting . Each subtest receives maximum 9 point , maximum total score 81 . Scores provide functional profile neglect meaningful guide treatment . The BIT show robust predictor visuospatial neglect predictor functionality stroke . It quantify neglect offering establish concrete cutoff detection visuospatial neglect ( BIT &lt; 130 ) . Inter-rater , parallel form , test-retest reliability high ( r = .99 , .91 , .99 , respectively , p &lt; .001 ) . Concurrent validity establish examine relationship conventional behavioral test score ( r = .92 , P &lt; .001 ) . There exist validated German version BIT , call NET ( Neglect-Test ) use study project . The ZüMAX NET repeat 3 week train intervention furthermore 4 week train intervention follow . As follow investigator assess personal experience neglect patient individual interviews.To describe understand person visuo-spatial neglect experience discover disability daily life rehabilitation , investigator therefore choose adopt transcendental psychological phenomenological research design . A phenomenological study describe mean several individual live experience phenomenon - project : visuo-spatial neglect . These experience best assess individual interview . To find experience play neglect exergames support learn handle disability , open-ended interview question address topic include interview guide . The interview take place week follow-up measurement place convenient participant . Meanwhile investigator assessing also personal experience clinic staff involve neglect exergame training focus group interview . In order deepen collect answer questionnaire give clinic staff involve study , examiner organize focus-group interview termination neglect exergame training intervention . The beforehand evaluate `` clinic staff questionnaire '' serve basis discussion .</detailed_description>
