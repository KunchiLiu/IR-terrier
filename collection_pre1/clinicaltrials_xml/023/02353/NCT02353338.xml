	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Distal radius fracture ( DRF ) common upper extremity fracture late middle-aged patient . This injury create significant disability render person without full use affect hand wrist 6 week potential long-term consequence post-traumatic wrist arthritis contracture . Over past 20 year , surgical management DRF increase substantially . Despite frequency fracture , little comparative evidence guide surgical decision-making population . Although surgical management improve radiographic outcome , appear radiographic outcome correlate well patient report outcome ( pain function ) . As significant health resource implication surgical versus conservative management , imperative determine operative fixation need . Further , population aging , number patient DRF increase substantially late middle-aged elderly adult . For subject 55 year age , surgical management often undertaken allow early mobility facilitate return work activity , even presence equivocal clinical outcome management approach . Conversely , old 70 year , conservative management common due low patient demand . However , American Academy Orthopedic Surgeons issue clinical practice guideline could make evidence base treatment recommendation patient age 55 70 year DRFs . Thus , current available evidence compare patient outcomes surgical conservative management age group . The overall goal RIST compare outcomes patient age 55-70 year receive surgical conservative management . Our primary outcome clinical measure ( patient-reported performance-based ) rather radiographic alignment . Because evidence focus around age group sparse , first conduct pilot trial clarify eligibility criterion , outcome measure selection , sample size requirement , recruitment retention rate . In 2013 , 610 patient age 55-70 year DRFs see Edmonton emergency department 314 inpatient age 55-70 year DRFs discharge hospital great Edmonton area . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : To determine feasibility conduct definitive RCT compare surgical versus conservative management 55-70 year old patient DRF . This study examine : 1 . Recruitment eligibility rate 2 . Treatment fidelity ( ability deliver intervention way intend ) measurement patient crossover non-operative management operative fixation within first year fracture 3 . Outcomes outcome measure determine appropriate measure sample size require 4 . Retention rate 1 year . Secondary objective : To compare clinical radiographic outcome surgical conservative management 55-70 year old patient DRF first year post-fracture use : 1 . Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation ( PRWE ) Questionnaire - currently deem primary outcome measure 2 . Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand ( DASH ) Questionnaire 3 . Patient satisfaction regard cosmesis use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 4 . Grip strength use hand-held dynamometer 5 . Wrist Range Motion ( ROM ) use standardized goniometry 6 . Radiographic measure ( dorsal angulation , ulnar shortening , articular step gap . ) EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL Study Design : Parallel RCT stratification surgeon use computer generate unequal randomization block . Following screening , consent baseline evaluation , research coordinator open sequentially numbered envelope assign treat surgeon . Participants randomize operative fixation cast treatment . Selection Criteria : This pilot RCT enroll 55 70 year old subject isolate intra- extra-articular displace DRFs present Sturgeon Community Hospital ( SCH ) medical care 1 5 fellowship-trained upper-extremity orthopaedic surgeon . Eligible subject present follow radiographic finding reduction : dorsal angulation ≤20 degree , ulnar shorten ≤5 mm relative contralateral side ( subject contralateral wrist xrays ) , articular step ≤2 mm initial post reduction gap ≤5 mm . These parameter choose meet accepted criterion distal radius fracture instability , still correctable osteotomy fracture heals degree mal-alignment . Patients volar Barton fracture , radiocarpal subluxation dislocation , open fracture , ipsilateral upper extremity injury , bilateral fracture multiple trauma exclude . Those previous injury fracture contralateral wrist , fit surgical management also exclude . Screening Enrollment : Patients screen study eligibility initial clinic visit attend surgeon research coordinator within 1 week injury . The Research Coordinator track reason refusal patient consent participate well exclusion surgeon base patient fracture characteristic . Those patient agree participate consent enrolled Research Coordinator . The baseline evaluation consist completion demographics/screening form form ( age , gender , mechanism injury , past current medical status , work activity demand ) PRWE DASH questionnaire . All data collect use standardized form enter password-protected database . Intervention : Following baseline evaluation , subject randomize receive either surgical conservative management . Those conservative management continue cast total 6 week . For randomized operative fixation , attend surgeon determine optimal fracture fixation method fracture pattern . At follow-up visit , surgeon , conjunction patient , evaluate outcome conservatively manage group determine corrective osteotomy indicate base patient 's pain , weakness acceptance clinical deformity . If corrective osteotomy required time point study , consider failure non-operative treatment . This approach use feasibility trial ass current selection criterion determine require revision prior definitive RCT . Follow-up Evaluations : Two week randomization , research coordinator contact participant telephone complete PRWE Dash questionnaire , ask complication related injury . Participants return clinical follow-up 6 week , 3 month , 6 month 12 month SCH use validated measure . Starting 6 week assessment , wrist ROM ( flexion , extension , pronation , supination , ulnar radial deviation ) use goniometer grip strength use hand-held dynamometer also evaluate research coordinator . Radiographic evaluation dorsal angulation , ulnar shortening , articular step gap complication adverse event also record visit . At 1-year follow-up , patient satisfaction clinical outcome assess use PRWE DASH questionnaires VAS determine satisfaction wrist cosmesis . Outcomes Outcome Measures : Although radiographic parameter collect measure , primary outcomes clinical measure : patient-reported wrist specific outcome ( PRWE ) , patient report upper extremity function ( DASH ) wrist ROM grip strength . 1 . Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation ( PRWE ) Questionnaire - The PRWE brief , reliable valid 15-item tool use assess patient-rated wrist pain disability activity daily live . Subjects rate pain function 0-10 two different subscales : pain subscale function subscale . The minimally clinically important difference ( MCID ) PRWE 17 point 0-100 score . 2 . Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand ( DASH ) Questionnaire - The DASH valid reliable 30-item scale assess physical function symptom subject upper limb musculoskeletal issue . It three module : disability symptom ( mandatory ) , work ( optional ) sports/performing art ( optional ) . The MCID DASH 13 point 0-100 score . 3 . Patient satisfaction - Patient satisfaction outcome part answer PRWE DASH questionnaire , since ass pain function . However , compare surgical versus conservative treatment , also important evaluate satisfied subject cosmesis wrist treatment . Conservative treatment may leave mal-aligned wrist surgical treatment leave scar acceptability either may affect willingness subject agree either treatment choice . Therefore , use visual analogue scale measure satisfy subject cosmesis wrist treatment ( 0- satisfy 10- completely satisfy ) . 4 . Grip strength - Peak value grip strength hand measure hand-held dynamometer . Absolute value percentage contralateral side compare two group . The MCID grip strength DRF 6.5 kilogram 20 % . 5 . Wrist Range Motion ( ROM ) - Active passive ROM wrist flexion , extension , ulnar deviation , radial deviation , pronation supination assess use goniometry . Absolute value percentage contralateral side compare group . No MCID establish wrist ROM , evaluate difference ROM correlate grip strength patient report outcome determine difference ROM appear affect outcome , . 6 . Radiographic Parameters : Dorsal angulation , ulnar shortening , articular step gap measure initial presentation fracture heal ( 6 week ) end study period ( 12 month ) . Sample Size : For feasibility trial , 50 participant ( 25/group ) enrol . This allow u assess subject recruitment , treatment fidelity retention . Based finding , refine selection criterion necessary definitive RCT . This pilot evaluation provide calculation sample size definitive RCT base confirmation primary outcome measure . Although 50 participant likely inadequate detect significant group difference , adequate determine MCID occur clinical outcome group . Analysis : The analysis feasibility component RIST trial 2-pronged prepare definitive RCT : 1 . Process Evaluation : This process evaluation descriptive analysis assist u refine eligibility criterion , recruitment rate , treatment fidelity determine study timeline prior undertake large scale RCT . Recruitment , enrollment retention rate : All 55-70 year old DRF patient present SCH screen eligibility , recruitment retention rate assess . We also evaluate recruitment method determine proportion patient 1 ) willing participate 2 ) appropriate randomization . 2 . Treatment Fidelity : We assess failure allocation treatment examine number patient withdraw post randomization cross surgical management within first post-fracture year . This determine selection criterion require refinement . Intervention Evaluation : Our secondary objective compare outcome randomize group . T-tests repeat measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) use continuous variable chi square test perform categorical variable . Outcome Selection : We believe PRWE responsive measure patient-reported wrist specific pain function . However , also evaluate DASH , cosmesis satisfaction ( VAS ) performance-based measure grip strength wrist ROM . Radiographic parameter consider primary outcome previous work suggest clinical radiographic parameter well-correlated DRF . Sample Size Calculation : The intervention analysis also allow u determine perform superiority inferiority RCT . If MCID detect pilot study ( expect ) , definitive RCT power non-inferiority trial ( i.e . similar clinical outcome achieve surgical conservative management age group ) . If MCID find clinical measure , definitive RCT power superiority trial ( e.g . surgical fixation well conservative treatment ) . Expected Outcome : This propose pilot study important assess feasibility conduct definitive RCT potential challenge address prior commence larger-scale trial . The pilot data generate used develop grant proposal adequately-powered definitive RCT . However , believe pilot study appropriate presentation publication peer-reviewed journal . The RIST pilot ensue RCT lead improve management wrist fracture address gap current evidence base . The level 1 evidence generate definitive RCT publish peer-reviewed journal present national international meeting .</detailed_description>
