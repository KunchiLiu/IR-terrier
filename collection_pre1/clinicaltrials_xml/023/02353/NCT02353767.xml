	<brief_title>Evaluation Liver Fibrosis HIV-infected Patients With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-associated morbidity mortality considerably modify ever since availability potent antiretroviral treatment 1996 . Recent study show impact treatment , decreased frequency AIDS-related disease coincide preponderance non-AIDS related pathology . Consequently , diseases hepatic origin become key problem therapeutic course HIV-infected patient , represent major source significant morbidity mortality . Liver-related disease comprise various etiology , include co-infection chronic viral hepatitis excessive alcohol consumption . When exclude particular disease , fibrotic patient exhibit elevate prevalence metabolic syndrome , regardless lipodystrophy . Directly link metabolic syndrome , non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis capacity induce necro-inflammatory lesion increase risk evolve cirrhosis complication thereto ( i.e . hepatocellular carcinoma , liver decompensation , end-stage liver disease ) . In context HIV , little data available concern link metabolic syndrome hepatic fibrosis , despite increase risk develop disease extend life-span , long-term disruption glycolipid metabolism induce antiretroviral treatment , presence various social risk-factors ( i.e . increase trend weight gain decrease physical activity ) . The principal objective present study characterize prevalence determinant associate hepatic fibrosis among HIV-infected patient , without co-infection hepatitis virus , present symptom metabolic syndrome accord AHA 2009 definition . In order appropriately answer research question , conduct nest , match case-control study include 300 HIV-infected patient per group . We also aim identify risk-factors liver fibrosis metabolic syndrome , study agreement 4 non-invasive score liver fibrosis 3 non-invasive score steatosis , evaluate performance Controlled Attenuation Parameter ( CAP ) method use diagnose hepatic steatosis . All patient study recruited clinical center situate infectious disease unit Saint-Antoine Hospital , 3400 HIV-infected patient regular consultation . Patients identify in-house informatics platform , serve surveillance tool metabolic syndrome , among disease , intention increase better-adapted clinical therapeutic care . Each patient present metabolic syndrome match control patient follow characteristic : age ( ±5 year ) , duration HIV-infection ( ±2 year ) , HIV-RNA viral load ( category &lt; 50-500 , 501-1000 , &gt; 1000 copies/mL ) , gender . Patients abnormal transaminase exclude study . This study bring clear understanding frequency importance liver fibrosis risk patient metabolic syndrome , allow u determine important element surveillance necessary prevention development hepatic lesion . Accordingly , study add pertinent information regard treatment guideline specific patient population .</detailed_description>
