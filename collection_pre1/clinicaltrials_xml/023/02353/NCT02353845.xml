	<brief_title>Construction Diagnosis System Early AD Based Multi-Modality MRI Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cognition aMCI normal age dementia , think transitional stage dementia . Patients aMCI heavy risk convert AD , study , investigator focus construction diagnosis system early AD base multi-modality MRI characteristic aMCI patient . Every patient underwent Î²-Amyloid PET , fluorodeoxyglucose-PET ( FDG-PET ) , structural MRI , diffusion tensor image functional MRI . Then investigator study patient convert AD explore MRI metabolism characteristic baseline , order construct predictable classifier aMCI AD . The investigator want achieve early diagnosis AD help clinician interfere progress disease .</detailed_description>
