	<brief_summary>An Agency Healthcare Research Quality executive summary indicate well comparative effectiveness trial design need determine relative merit exist versus new expensive biologic drug therapy rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . There 9 biologic therapy approve treat RA . Four class biologics ( TNF antagonist , B-cell inhibitor , T-cell co-stimulator blocker , Interleukin-6 receptor blocker ) approve use RA patient moderate severe disease activity . Several critical question arise , 1 ) therapy prescribed failure methotrexate and/or oral disease modify antirheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) adequately control disease activity ; 2 ) level efficacy various biologic therapy compare head-to-head trial ; 3 ) mechanism associate failure methotrexate and/or oral DMARD therapy responsiveness biologic therapy . The MAZERATI study provide foundation answer question determine mechanism associate biologic therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanistic Studies B- T-Cell Function RA Patients Treated With TNF Antagonists , Tocilizumab , Abatacept</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single center , randomize , assessor-blinded , observational longitudinal assessment . Subjects randomized treatment anti-TNF therapy , tocilizumab abatacept evaluate baseline , 1 , 3 6 month therapy . All biologics administer subcutaneously ( SQ ) . A blinded assessor perform clinical disease activity assessment blood sample obtain mechanistic study . After randomization , patient must take least one dose assign medication must maintain baseline prednisone oral disease modify anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARD ) medication receive first dose assign medication consider per protocol participant . During first 3 month therapy , patient physician permit taper increase corticosteroid . Adjustments study medication oral DMARDs permit first 3 month study except outline protocol . Adjustments addition analgesic permit throughout study period . Following randomization treatment initiation , study participant see clinic 1 month ( 3-5 week ) , 3 month ( 10-14 week ) , 6 month ( 22-30 week ) initiation therapy ; time point , blind clinical disease activity assessment occur blood sample obtain mechanistic study . The occurrence severity unanticipated problem record continuously throughout study .</detailed_description>
