	<brief_summary>Drug metabolism liver subject large fluctuation ( difference woman men , people different ethnic background , child adult ) . These large difference responsible different drug effect side-effects ( especially liver damage cause drug ) individual . Recent scientific finding suggest blood derive cell use model individual effect drug liver reflect inter-individual difference . Since liver damage cause drug diagnosis exclusion , aforementioned cell use identify patient show high sensitivity hepatotoxic side-effects - case several drug involve - identify causal agent possible interaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Drug-induced liver injury ( DILI ) , especially idiosyncratic often unpredictable complication drug therapy . Until challenge predict occurrence , severity outcome DILI . Previous data provide evidence cell peripheral blood may reflect hepatocellular damage ( Fannin RD , Hepatology . 2010 ) . Own research could show peripheral monocyte capable obtain several hepatocyte-like function maintain individual characteristic donor , especially cytochrome P450 metabolism ( Benesic , Gerbes , et al , Lab Invest 2012 ) . This study investigate effect potentially hepatotoxic drug cell generate patient blood comparison clinical presentation . Its aim evaluation vitro test use monocyte derive cell diagnosis exclusion DILI potential use patient derived-cells mechanistic investigation DILI . 4 group investigate : 1 ) donor without liver disease 2 ) patient start therapy DILI-potential ; 3 ) DILI patient ; 4 ) patient liver injury DILI . Patient history clinical data obtain single blood sample collect informed consent .</detailed_description>
