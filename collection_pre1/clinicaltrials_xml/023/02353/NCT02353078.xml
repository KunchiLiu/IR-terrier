	<brief_title>The Effect Sucralfate Slurry Patients With Eosinophilic Esophagitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE ) Th2 type allergy mediate disease characterize dense esophageal eosinophilia patient chronic esophageal symptom . One mechanisms eosinophilic esophagitis exposure food antigen antigen recognition cell esophageal mucosa initiate chronic allergy-based inflammatory response [ 1 , 2 ] . It believe exposure facilitate dilation intercellular space ( DIS ) esophageal epithelial cell ( termed spongiosis ) . This substantiate several study demonstrate : first , DIS commonly find biopsy patient active EoE reverse steroid therapy [ 3 ] ; second , DIS correlate physiologic demonstration increase esophageal epithelial permeability show transepithelial small molecule flux mucosal biopsy appraise Ussing chamber [ 4 ] , third , DIS associate decreased expression specific epithelial tight junction protein filaggrin [ 3 ] . Thus , suggest sequence event EoE lead allergen initiate inflammation include regulation tight junction protein , dilation intercellular space surface epithelium follow increased permeability facilitate exposure food antigen . Of present therapy available , topical steroid subset EoE patient , proton pump inhibitor may improve epithelial permeability . Unfortunately , case proton pump inhibitor , early data suggest therapeutic benefit sustain . With use steroid , fear long term side effect continue use swallow steroid might . The alternative treatment , diet exclusion therapy difficult tailor patient impractical adult patient . As result , alternative treatment need EoE . Sucralfate medication develop treatment acid-peptic disease . It 's mechanism action heal lesion gastroduodenal mucosal ulceration still remain unclear describe `` cytoprotective '' agent . Several mechanism suggest responsible protection . These include : binding protection expose erode area , increase prostaglandin production , improve vascular flow , increased mucus production . This compound also show augment potential difference gastric mucosa suggest decreased ion flow . The investigator show measure mucosal impedance EoE , may relate closure intercellular space could make attractive therapy eosinophilic esophagitis . Furthermore , side effect profile sucralfate excellent little systemic absorption . Sucralfate category ( B ) medication , safe female child bear year .</detailed_description>
