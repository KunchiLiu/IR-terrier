	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Ultrasound Hyperthermia Combined With Chemotherapy Oral Maxillofacial-Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As non-invasive treatment , Ultrasound Hyperthermia receive increase interest treatment cancer.Many study show Therapeutic Ultrasound safe effective . Eligible patient randomly assign use permutated block design site receive either Ultrasound Hyperthermia combine chemotherapy ( Arm A ) chemotherapy alone ( Arm B ) .Chemotherapy conduct follow . For Squamous cell carcinoma head neck , administrate Docetaxel ( dose 75 mg per square meter body-surface area intravenous infuse 1 hr day 1rt ) , Cisplatin ( dose 75 mg per square meter body-surface area intravenous infuse 1 hr day 1rt ) Fluorouracil ( dose 75 mg per square meter body-surface area intravenous infuse last 5 day ) . For type cancer , treatment administrate accord guideline.In addition , Ultrasound Hyperthermia conduct 5 time ( day 1rt,3rd,5th,7th,9th ) Arm A . Patients arm B receive chemotherapy . One cycle comprise period 3 week ( 21 day ) .All patient receive 2 cycle arm . All patient eligible operation take surgery . After treatment，some patient advance unresectable cancer may down-staged stage IV , regain opportunity operation .</detailed_description>
