	<detailed_description>Background justification study Auditory Processing Disorder Auditory Processing Disorder ( APD ) disorder function ear ( outer , middle , inner ) normal person difficulty identify discriminate sound ( Dawes &amp; Bishop , 2009 ) . For child APD particularly difficult hear listen condition ideal . For example , background noise become really challenging focus speaker . Two factor influence hear ability reverberation distance speaker ( Keith &amp; Purdy , 2014 ) . Moreover , study show comorbidity APD language reading disorder ( Sharma et al. , 2009 ) support attention memory might influence APD ( Moore et al. , 2013 ) . It also argue APD could well one dimension cluster developmental condition ( Dawes &amp; Bishop , 2009 ) . Nonetheless , profile child APD clearly outline order confused common developmental disorder ( Bamiou et al. , 2001 ) . FM system Personal Frequency Modulation ( FM ) system wireless listening device pick speaker 's voice transmit receiver listener 's ear . In way , negative effect ambient noise , distance speaker reverberation reduce ( Keith &amp; Purdy , 2014 ) . Research suggest child APD prolong use FM system benefit improved speech perception possibly link enhanced auditory system ( Johnston et al. , 2009 ) . Adding , child APD show improved speech noise perception use FM system , hence emphasize advantage FM system discriminate speech background noise ( Johnston et al. , 2009 ) . There many study , though , focus use FM system child APD . Attention ability listen spatialised noise child APD use FM system research yet . As central point study use FM system child APD 6 month , expect finding could add valuable information subject . In addition , possible benefit FM system examine detail . More particularly , possible improvement auditory attention , speech noise performance ( aid unaided ) listen spatialised noise look . Attention Higher-level brain function ( neurocognitive behavioural ) major influence ability listener decode interpret receive sound ( Bellis , 2011 ) . Attention , turn , central role shape perception complex auditory task ( Sussman &amp; Steinschneider , 2009 ) . Attention play important part `` reorganize passive , low-level acoustic process normal development '' ( Sussman &amp; Steinschneider , 2009 : 784 ) . Thus , child APD , attention deficit negative impact automatic sound organization ( Sussman &amp; Steinschneider , 2009 ) . In review , Moore ( 2011 ) highlight poor listen mean child 's hearing bad . Rather , result study suggest listen problem cause poor attention work memory . Thus , neurological symptom exist , poor listen likely link attention memory deficit ( Moore , 2011 ) . However , Sharma et al . ( 2009 ) conclude study auditory attention memory necessarily present together APD . This study use Test Everyday Attention Children ( TEACh ) test child 's auditory attention . Another test administer assess child 's ability listen spatialised noise Listen Spatialised Noise - Sentences test ( LiSN-S ) . Besides , speech noise test perform classroom ( without use FM system ) . Therefore , possible link APD auditory attention listen spatialised noise ability identify . This build current knowledge matter help u determine possible link FM use attention performance . As state earlier , cognitive function test previous study employ FM use APD population . Listening noise As already mention , APD usually coincide poor speech noise perception ( Keith &amp; Purdy , 2014 ) . Interestingly enough finding study Ferguson et al . ( 2011 ) indicate child APD difficulty listen noise . Nevertheless , evidence claim enough ( British Society Audiology , 2011a ) . In fact , Johnston et al . 's ( 2009 ) study indicate improvement listen speech noise performance child APD , follow 5-month personal FM system intervention . In present study , two test assess speech noise perception administer ; LiSN-S test , assess listen performance spatialised speech noise Chear Auditory Perception Test ( CAPT ) , administer classroom ( without use FM ) ( Vickers et al. , 2013 ) Results might reveal possible link APD listen noise performance thus could shed light issue raise Ferguson et al . 's study . Aim hypotheses Principal research question : The principal research question examine effect FM system auditory attention listen noise performance child Auditory Processing Disorder ( APD ) . More specifically , hypothesize prolong use personal FM system lead improve auditory attention , improved ability listen spatialised noise improve listening noise perception ( aid unaided ) improvement correlate questionnaire response parent , teacher children.. Hypotheses : . Children APD use FM system show great improvement auditory attention , listen spatialised speech noise listen noise ( aid unaided ) 6 month FM use comparison APD control group . ii . Children APD use FM system show great improvement listen spatialised speech noise 6 month FM use comparison APD control group . iii . Children APD use FM system show great improvement listen noise ( aid unaided ) 6 month FM use comparison APD control group . iv . All outcome measure ( auditory attention , listen spatialised noise , listen noise ) correlate questionnaire result parent ( ask child 's improvement ) , questionnaire result teacher ( report attention student ) questionnaire result child report listen hearing aid benefit . Secondary research question : - Is listen noise ( aid ) similar listen noise ( unaided ) 6 month FM use ? - What characteristics child improvement/lower rate improvement ? Summary main issue Research suggest child APD prolong use FM system benefit improved speech perception possibly link enhanced auditory system ( Johnston et al. , 2009 ) .. Adding , child APD show improved speech noise perception use FM system ( uncontrolled study ) ; hence emphasizing advantage FM system discriminate speech background noise ( Johnston et al. , 2009 ) . There many study , though , focus use FM system child APD . This study assess effect FM listen assistive device use range outcome measure . As central point study use FM system child APD 6 month , expect finding could add valuable information matter . In addition , possible benefit FM system examine detail . More particularly , possible improvement auditory attention , listen spatialised noise speech noise discrimination ( aid unaided ) look . Intervention ethical issue : We split child APD ( ) child receive FM system , ( b ) child receive intervention study period ( group receive FM system complete study , 6 month condition : A . They show improvement decrease score listening-in-noise score , B . The recommendation APD clinic GOSH include FM system management strategy . For instance , child show decrease score listening-in-noise score , look recommendation suggest use FM system classroom , provide FM system child . On hand , child show improve score listening-in-noise score , require get form intervention end study exhibit improvement anyway ) . Currently audit conduct GOSH APD Clinic , 1 3 child recommend FM system obtain school funding ( parent fund device ) take place several month recommendation make . Therefore , provision device standard practice . As FM system issue part research study . We believe FM system benefit child recruit provide recruited child delay 6 month third group child due need non-intervention control group study period . An inclusion control , intervention group , essential Randomised Control Trial . Outcome measure issue : This study use follow outcome measure intervention . Primary outcome measure : 1 . A validated attention test ( Test Everyday Attention Children -TEACh ) test child 's auditory attention . 2 . A validated test Listening Spatialised Noise - Sentences test ( LiSN-S ) . This test child 's ability listen spatialised speech noise . 3 . A validated consonant perception test call Chear Auditory Perception Test ( CAPT ) . This test child 's ability discriminate word background noise . Secondary outcome measure : 1 . Parental questionnaire ( The Children 's Communication Checklist-2 [ CCC-2 ] Children 's Auditory Performance Scale ( CHAPS ) . 2 . Teacher questionnaire ( Screening Instrument For Targeting Educational Risk [ SIFTER ] ) . 3 . Children questionnaires ( Listening Inventory For Education-Revised [ LIFE-R ] Abbreviated Profile Hearing Aid Benefit [ APHAB ] ) . There still universal APD test battery ( British Society Audiology , 2011b ) . The comparison result four group help assess whether change auditory attention listen noise performance ( aid unaided ) whether change correlate result questionnaire . Inclusion criterion : As previously state inclusion criterion study ( ) APD diagnosis , ( b ) Age range 8-11 year ( c ) Normal IQ , ( ) No neurological problem . Exclusion criterion : ( ) Presence developmental delay , pervasive learn disorder autism attention deficit hyperactivity disorder non-verbal IQ bad 85 . ( ii ) Presence neurological disorder epilepsy . Criterion ( b ) use main age referral APD test GOSH . Criteria ( c ) , ( ) , ( ) ( ii ) set order minimize possibility APD cause cognitive neurological problem link pervasive learning disorder developmental delay . School teacher involvement : The teacher child receive FM system provide PIS consent form require wear FM microphone ( pick teacher 's voice transmit wirelessly ear receiver child 's ear ) clothe duration class . Please note FM system provide ( funded school budget ) child clinical recommendation unusual situation within school environment . We liaise teacher well Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator ( SENCO ) school order ensure school aware student issue FM system . A general guide FMs ( see attach document , revise ) make available addition information convey Research Fellow ( PhD student ) visit school per term . In addition , visit begin end study ( 0 6 month ) , CAPT test administer . There already study child Cochlear Implants show child study able use personal handset issue ( Vickers et al. , 2013 ) . All child classroom take part , thus inform consent seek parent . The purpose include child classroom ass performance APD child classroom relation his/ classmate . If parent wish child take part include test . This hinder data collection , main focus APD child , number his/ non-APD classmate could vary . Informed consent : The child 's parent give detailed write information consent form sign take part study . They give week study decide whether wish child participate study . They allow take part understood purpose procedure study sign consent form . In addition , child also give information sheet adjust age . Written assent child presence parent carers seek . Rights withdraw study : This outlined information sheet consent form , explain verbally throughout . This information state participant allow withdraw study point wish . Withdrawal study involve penalty loss benefit -this information clearly underlined information sheet make clear verbally . Data protection : The parent participant participant inform information anonymised keep confidential . Data anonymised prior analysis use participant code . Storage data within secure password protect database lock file unit within UCL , accordance data protection act 1998 . If withdrawal take place participant ' data delete . Other issue : The consonant discrimination test perform APD child study also non-APD child . The result two group compare . In order facilitate recruitment non-APD control , ask child APD bring one friend day test . These child age gender matched . However , expect friend study 's participant , could confound factor . It could also child APD may want may friend bring . In case ask parent child inform researcher prepare low attendance non-APD control . This also impact result , reduce non-APD control group . However , rationale behind test child APD also act control . The test perform FM system FM system . Thus , efficacy FM system measure comparison . The inclusion non-APD control additional comparison well child APD perform FM system compare age match control . It comparison might compromise due reduce control group . Research Design Methodology Participants Recruitment We recruit 30 child , 8-11 year old . All child diagnose referred Auditory Processing Disorders Clinic Great Ormond Street Hospital ( GOSH ) . The total sample size decide use power sample : 15 child per group ( basis estimate 1 SD effect size , n = 15/f2 n = sample size per group , f=effect size , 80 % power 5 % significance ) . The inclusion criterion : 1 . Diagnosis APD ( base routine clinical test GOSH : ) Abnormal performance auditory figure ground test ( speech noise test ) SCAN-C ( i.e . 1st percentile score per UK norm ) , ) Abnormal performance one non-speech auditory processing test ( frequency pattern , duration pattern , gap noise random gap detection pattern task ) , e ) Parent report speech noise listen difficulty . 2 . No neurological disorder , pervasive attention deficit disorder developmental delay . 3 . Normal IQ . 4 . Age range 8-11 year . Exclusion criterion : A . Presence developmental delay , pervasive learn disorder autism attention deficit hyperactivity disorder non-verbal IQ bad 85 . B . Presence neurological disorder epilepsy Subjects semi-randomly assign four intervention arm . The four group stratify age balance sex . A prospective case control study use . Children give FM system use school plus auditory training ( three different intervention group ) group directly compare also compare control ( intervention ) group . Each child enrol study 6 month . All group test start FM intervention end study ( 6 month use intervention ) . Following assessment perform group UCL Ear Institute ( detailed explanation test give later ) : - Baseline ( recruitment , 0 month study ) : - Pure Audiometry Test ( PTA ) - Listening Spatialised noise ( LiSN-S ) - Speech noise test ( aid unaided ) - Questionnaires ( CHAPS , CCC-2 ) - Questionnaires ( SIFTER , LIFE-R , APHAB ) - Attention test ( TEACh ) - Non-verbal IQ test ( Weschler test Non-verbal intelligence ) - At 3 month - Listening Spatialised noise ( LiSN-S ) - Questionnaires ( CHAPS , CCC-2 ) - Questionnaires ( SIFTER , LIFE-R , APHAB ) - Attention test ( TEACh ) - At end study ( 6 month later ) : - Listening Spatialised Noise ( LiSN-S ) - Questionnaires ( CHAPS , CCC-2 ) - Questionnaires ( SIFTER , LIFE-R , APHAB ) - Attention test ( TEACh ) . Explanation test : 1 . A hearing test ( Pure Tone Audiometry approx . 10mins ) . To determine hear normal . 2 . An attention test . The Test Everyday Attention Children ( TEACh ) . To conduct play type activity PhD student receive sufficient train clinical psychologist . ( approx . 45mins possibly cut 30mins ) . To assess attention . 3 . Listening spatialised noise test ( LiSN-S , approx . 15mins ) . To administer use headphone PhD student . To determine listen spatialised speech noise ability . 4 . Consonant perception test noise call Chear Auditory Perception Test ( CAPT , approx . 45mins ) . This test child 's ability discriminate word background noise . This test perform APD child study result compare result non-APD child . 5 . Two questionnaire fill child 's parent . 1 . The Children 's Communication Checklist-2 ( CCC-2 ) . A 70-item questionnaire screen communication problem ( include language disorder autism ) . 2 . The Children 's Auditory Performance Scale ( CHAPS ) . It assess aspects child 's listening . 6 . One questionnaire complete teacher ( Screening Instrument For Targeting Educational Risk [ SIFTER ] ) ass attention , communication , class participation school behaviour . 7 . Two questionnaire complete child ( Listening Inventory For Education-Revised [ LIFE-R ] assess listen difficulty Abbreviated Profile Hearing Aid Benefit assess benefit FM use FM group ) . 8 . Non-verbal IQ test ( Weschler test non-verbal intelligence ) . To perform PhD Student . ( approx . 15mins ) . To assess determine whether intelligence level normal . 1 . Data analysis The data analysis perform outcome measure . . Looking difference score aforementioned test group ( Groups A , B , C D ) : We use mixed model Analysis Variance ( ANOVA ) subject factor ( group - compare 4 group ) within subject factor ( time - pre , mid post intervention ) . ii . We assess whether behavioural outcome measure correlate measure communication ( measure CHAPS CCC2 questionnaires SIFTER LIFE-R APHAB questionnaire ) . We use regression analysis measure . Other issue None test invasive unpleasant , conduct comfortable sound level ( slightly high usual conversational level ) . Any additional information child might emerge study report back clinician APD clinic inform child 's management . All child participate receive book voucher GBP10 end test session . Travel expense also reimburse ( GBP10 ) .</detailed_description>
