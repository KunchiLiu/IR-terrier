	<brief_summary>The purpose study find characteristic mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) use technology Multi-Modality MRI , include structural MRI , functional MRI diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . Then analyze difference progressive MCI ( MCIp ) stable MCI ( MCIs ) construct predictable classifier MCI Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) base Multi-Modality MRI characteristic MCI patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The cognition MCI normal healthy AD , think transitional stage AD . Patients MCI heavy risk convert AD , study , investigator focus exploration characteristic mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) use technology Multi-Modality MRI , include structural MRI , functional MRI DTI . Then investigator study patient convert AD explore MRI characteristic baseline , order construct predictable classifier MCI AD . The investigator want achieve early diagnosis AD help clinician interfere progress disease .</detailed_description>
