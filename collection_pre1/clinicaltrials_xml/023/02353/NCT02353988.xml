	<brief_summary>Growing study demonstrate Androgen Receptor ( AR ) oncogenic role patient AR-positive Triple Negative Breast Cancer ( TNBC ) . AR antagonists therapy , bicalutamide , completely bind AR , increase AR degradation , thus investigated efficacy treatment patient AR-positive TNBC study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AR-inhibitor Bicalutamide Treating Patients With TNBC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 70 % human breast cancer express androgen receptor ( AR ) , retrospective analysis , expression AR Triple-Negative Breast Cancer ( TNBC ) vary 10-43 % . Recently emerge preclinical clinical data suggest AR may play role tumor proliferation . For example , Hu et al ( 2011 ) analyze AR expression 211 TNBC case . He find AR relate 83 % increase overall mortality , compare AR-negative TNBC . McGhan et al ( 2014 ) also find AR expression tends exist TNBC patient higher tumor stage lymph metastasis . The role AR also extensively studied vitro . With target AR small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) treatment anti-androgen bicalutamide , study show AR proliferative role TNBC cell . Robinson et al ( 2011 ) also clarify AR mimic estrogen receptor α ( ERα ) transcriptionally active manner direct forkhead box protein A1 ( FoxA1 ) . These indicate , ER-negative disease , AR promote tumor progression , therefore , could serve therapeutic target TNBC . Due demonstration oncogenic role AR TNBC , clinical trial underway study role inhibit androgen signal treatment TNBC . For example , Gucalp et al ( 2013 ) perform sing-arm phase II study investigate role bicalutamide AR-positive TNBC . A total 26 patient enrol study , study demonstrate general well tolerated effect 6-month clinical benefit rate 19 % . Furthermore , future clinical trial also design show anti-androgen therapy Enzalutamide , 17alpha-hydroxylase/C ( 17,20 ) -lyase inhibitor abiraterone acetate orteronel AR-positive TNBC . This study investigate study role bicalutamide AR-positive TNBC , may help clarify effect bicalutamide specific breast cancer subtype . Furthermore , may provide additional therapy treat difficult treat population .</detailed_description>
