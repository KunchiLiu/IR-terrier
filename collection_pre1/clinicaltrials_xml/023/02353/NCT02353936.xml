	<brief_summary>As 2nd generation EGFR-TKI irreversibly bind EGFR receptor , afatinib show possibility superior effect 1st generation TKIs erlotinib gefitinib . In phase III study LUX-lung 3 patient EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer , afatinib monotherapy show long progression-free disease survival time 11.1 month ( 6.9 month ) pemetrexed/cisplatin combination therapy . Based result , currently recommend standard first-line treatment EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer , clinical study also actively conduct type carcinomas characterize EGFR gene mutation overexpression . Thirty ( 30 ) solid cancer patient include phase I trial afatinib , , patient esophageal cancer partial response . Taken together , base upon result clinical trial afatinib conduct far , 7 15 esophageal cancer patient achieve clinical response 3 month longer . Hence , overall result previous study gefitinib erlotinib EGFR TKIs study dacomitinib , well precede study afatinib - 2nd generation EGFR TKI - suggest possibility effective therapy esophageal cancer characterize well-known EGFR overexpression . In phase II trial , afatinib shall administer patient squamous cell carcinoma esophagus evaluate effect toxicity . Also , biomarkers predict response afatinib shall explore study .</brief_summary>
