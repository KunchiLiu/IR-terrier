	<detailed_description>American Academy Pediatrics guideline define growth rate preterm , underweight baby adequate match age-equivalent weight gain typical term infant , approximately 10-15 gram per kg per day . Unfortunately , many pre-terms , especially low birth weight one , achieve rate , result neurodevelopmental deficit low discharge weight . Typical feeding regimen , design increase weight gain , however , show increase rate fat accretion increase risk obesity metabolic disorder , insulin resistance type 2 diabetes , later life . Research show high protein diet reduce accretion body fat old , normal weight infant systematically test low birth weight pre-terms . The current study compare weight gain base fat accretion change body composition preterm infant receive high ( 4g/100 kcal ) versus low ( 3 g/100 kcal ) protein-energy ratio diet . The hypothesis test study : Increased protein intake reduce percentage weight gain due fat accretion pre-term infant . The identification effective feeding regimen would allow pre-term infant acquire age-equivalent growth rate similar term infant avoid excess accretion body fat could significantly improve long term health outcome high-risk population .</detailed_description>
