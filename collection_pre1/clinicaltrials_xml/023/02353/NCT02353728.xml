	<brief_summary>The study open-label phase 2 clinical translational trial design evaluate effect nilotinib leukemic stem cell population subject newly diagnose chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia ( Ph+ CML CP ) . Nilotinib FDA-approved treat subject Ph+ CML CP . Subjects study monitor accord accepted National Cancer Comprehensive Network [ NCCN ] clinical guideline 24 month . After 24 month , continue therapy need subject transition commercial supply study drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stem Cell Monitoring CML Patients Undergoing Nilotinib Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients newly diagnose Ph+ CML chronic phase eligible enrollment trial . Prior treatment nilotinib less 2 week hydroxyurea allow . Before therapy therapy , peripheral blood bone marrow sample obtain cytogenetic molecular evaluation . During study , blood collect approximately month 1 , month 3 , every 3 month thereafter ; aspirate sample collect approximately month 1 , month 3 , month 12 . These sample collect analyze quantitative qualitative change leukemic stem cell population therapy nilotinib . The study intend hypothesis finding analysis order establish whether response nilotinib therapy , define difference baseline therapy-induced change characteristic stem cell population predictive ability successfully discontinue therapy subject CML . In order determine effect nilotinib stem progenitor population evaluate 40 newly diagnose CML subject undergoing treatment nilotinib different time point . We evaluate level expression BCR-ABL purified stem cell population course treatment . In addition , compare stem progenitor population present course treatment peripheral blood bone marrow . We perform transcriptional profiling population determine change signal pathway drive survival , self-renewal proliferation . Whole exome sequencing also perform diagnostic sample determine whether novel cooperate mutation .</detailed_description>
