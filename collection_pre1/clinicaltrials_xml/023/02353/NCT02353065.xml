	<brief_summary>Colles fracture common type wrist fracture often require manipulation Emergency Department . Currently xrays use ass whether successful , do plaster cast apply . This study ass whether ultrasound use immediately manipulation check position , plaster cast applied . This would follow xray normal . The aim ass feasibility full study determine method faster , cause less pain , also ass either approach reduces need repeat attempt manipulation surgical repair .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fractures distal radius frequent cause presentation United Kingdom ( UK ) Emergency Departments , Colles ' fracture commonly encounter type . These injury frequently occur isolation , associate minor injury , reduction displace fracture typically perform Emergency Physicians time first attendance hospital . The usually sequence event clinical examination , x-ray imaging confirm fracture , reduction perform appropriate analgesia anaesthesia , arm place plaster backslab , repeat image take confirm adequacy reduction . If reduction satisfactory , repeat manipulation require . Haematoma block Biers block permit x-ray imaging manipulate wrist anaesthetic action still effective , permit re-manipulation without administration local anaesthetic . Sedation usually keep short time possible , usually maintain image perform . There usually degree delay x-ray take make available viewing , wait prolongs procedure patient treat clinician . In addition , Biers block tolerate long patient , delay make less likely re-manipulation achieve within time patient tolerate . If patient sedate , re-manipulation require sedative ( alternative ) procedure concomitant risk entail . Ideally , image would perform rapidly , immediately end manipulation , prior application plaster , allow confirmation reduction immediate re-manipulation necessary . This description image provide point care treat clinician , aim answer clearly define question ( 'is adequate reduction ? ' ) match description focus emergency ultrasound application . If ultrasound could use assess fracture reduction , would potential save clinician time , patient time discomfort , reduce need repeat manipulation surgical repair . This study intend assess feasibility full trial efficacy compare ultrasound x-ray guide reduction fracture .</detailed_description>
