	<detailed_description>Subjects screen ask complete sleep disorder questionnaires sleep diary establish normal sleep pattern rule sleep disorder . Eligible subject schedule Screening PSG rule PLMS , sleep apnea sleep disorder . Subjects meet screen PSG criterion randomly assign treatment sequence order involve study drug time subject awaken middle-of-the-night use crossover study design . These four sequence include Silenor 6 mg middle-of-the-night awaken 4 hour ( DXP-4H ) , zolpidem 10 mg middle-of-the-night awaken 1.5 hour ( ZOL-1.5H ) , placebo middle-of-the-night awaken 4 hour ( PBO-4H ) , placebo middle-of-the-night awaken 1.5 hour ( PBO-1.5H ) . Study drug administer fasted condition ( least 4 hour ) single dose bedtime ( approximately 2300 hour ) , subject receive one dose active drug ( Silenor 6 mg zolpidem 10 mg ) , two dos placebo treatment period . Safety assessment perform throughout study . During night assessment , subject awoken estimate T-max active drug , match placebo group awaken time point arousability protocol . Arousability assess use Auditory Awakening Threshold test ( AAT ) . Once Auditory Awakening Threshold determine , subject perform Tandem Walk assessment follow Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) finally Free Recall Memory test . Subjects discharge sleep center assessment complete . A final study visit perform subject either complete four Treatment Periods prematurely discontinue study .</detailed_description>
