	<brief_title>Trauma Patients Hypothermia Emergency Room : ReadyHeat® Versus Cotton Wool Blanket</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothermia common problem traumatize patient lead severe complication impaired coagulation , increased rate wound infection overall patient discomfort among others . Therefore , investigator test new self warming ( via exothermic reaction ) ReadyHeat® blanket device currently use cotton wool blanket term effect prevention treatment hypothermia . Near body core temperature measure sublingual sensor `` gold standard '' body core temperature measurement - pulmonary artery catheter - invasive suited collective patient emergency room setting . Blanket use randomize . Temperature take emergency room admission , 15 , 30 45 minute treatment well right hand patient next caring unit ( ICU , IMC , operate theatre etc. ) . If treatment time shorter expect measurement stop late possible point . Blankets apply patient admission emergency room complete lift intervention .</detailed_description>
