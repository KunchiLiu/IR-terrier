	<brief_title>The Effects Dexmedetomidine Heart Beat During Elective Surgery Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : This study conduct evaluate effect three different dos dexmedetomidine ( Precedex® , Hospira Healthcare ) myocardial repolarization , blood glucose potassium level child undergo elective surgery . Hypotheses : The investigator hypothesize administer dexmedetomidine bolus effect myocardial repolarization , blood glucose , potassium concentration dose-dependent manner , whereas saline bolus . Justification : Dexmedetomidine potent , centrally act α-2 adrenoreceptor agonist sympatholytic , sedative , amnestic , anxiolytic analgesic effect , property make popular use pediatric anesthesia intensive care . In 2013 , dexmedetomidine add `` possible risk factor torsades de pointes ( TdP ) '' drug list crediblemeds.org . Clinicians currently advise vigilant potential QT prolongation dexmedetomidine , especially patient congenital long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) . However , current evidence dexmedetomidine-induced prolonged QT sparse somewhat contradictory , effect dexmedetomidine Tp-e interval yet report detail adult child . Another poorly define pharmacodynamic effect dexmedetomidine effect blood glucose concentration . Theoretically , dexmedetomidine would expect cause hypoinsulinaemia resultant increase blood glucose level ( hyperglycemia ) . Previous study contrast however ; report hypoglycemia large dos drug . Considering use dexmedetomidine pediatric anesthesia , pediatric intensive care increase use neonatal population , increase knowledge effect dexmedetomidine blood glucose would valuable . Finally , hypokalemia list treatment-emergent adverse event occur &gt; 2 % adult patient receive dexmedetomidine long-term intensive care unit sedation study . The effect dexmedetomidine serum potassium level healthy child yet elucidate . Given hypokalemia increase risk TdP , possibility dexmedetomidine may torsadogenic , effect also worthy investigation . In sum , use dexmedetomidine associate many clinical benefit , effect indices myocardial repolarization , well effect glucose potassium metabolism , remain poorly understood need well define order use drug safely effectively . Objectives : The primary objective study investigate effect three different dos dexmedetomidine ( 0.25/0.5/0.75 mcg/kg ) indices myocardial repolarization ( QTc Tp-e interval ) . As secondary objective , study also sample blood glucose potassium level dexmedetomidine administration ascertain significant effect single bolus dose blood glucose concentration . Research Method : The investigator propose randomize , single-blinded , 4-group comparative study characterize effect different dos dexmedetomidine myocardial repolarization blood glucose level healthy child undergo elective surgery . The study-specific intervention include give bolus dexmedetomidine ( 0.25/0.5/0.75 mcg/kg ; 10mL saline ) induction general anesthesia , record two 12-lead ECGs ( one one dexmedetomidine administration ) , take three venous blood sample ( one two dexmedetomidine administration ) measure glucose potassium . If anesthetist would like administer dexmedetomidine participant control ( saline ) group part normal practice , study period ( last blood sample ) .</detailed_description>
