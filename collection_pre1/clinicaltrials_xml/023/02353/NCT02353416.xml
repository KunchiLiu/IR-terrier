	<detailed_description>Specialized receptor ( RAGE , Galectin 3â€¦ ) bind AGE . The binding receptor cause formation free radical , deleterious effect powerful oxidize agent , also play role intracellular messenger , alter cell function . This role especially true level endothelial cell attachment AGE RAGE receptor cause increase vascular permeability . AGE bind endothelium RAGE monocytes-macrophages , lead production cytokine , growth factor , expression adhesion molecule , production procoagulant activity . Increased permeability , facilitation leukocyte migration , production reactive oxygen specie , cytokine VEGF suggest AGE could element cascade reaction responsible diabetic angiopathy vascular damage observe age chronic renal failure . Recently , It 's propose balanced diet limit deleterious effect AGE . For reason , interest preventive approach complementary alternative cholesterol reduction one main objective cardiovascular research year come . Already '70s low incidence atherosclerotic disease Mediterranean country ( Greece Southern Italy ) importance `` dietary factor '' protection notice . Diets people country , among component , rich oleic acid , main constituent olive oil , 29 % daily caloric intake derive monounsaturated fatty acid . Aim trial estimate effect Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet AGE product .</detailed_description>
