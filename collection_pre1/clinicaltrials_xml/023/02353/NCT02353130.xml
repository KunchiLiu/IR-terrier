	<brief_summary>Specific Aim 1 : Obtain proof concept evidence cortical metric change response treatment Memantine extend release ( XR ) ® , agent modulates n-methyl d-asptartate ( NMDA ) receptor activation , child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) clinically demonstrate treatment response . Hypothesis1 : Children ASD dramatic clinical response Memantine XR® exhibit change cortical metric , differ le neurotypical child . Subjective rating improvement correlate change cortical metric . The completion aim essential design large federally fund trial validate cortical metric outcome measure heterogeneous pediatric ASD sample . Specifically , feasibility data obtain may demonstrate potential detecting change cortical metric time , large grant could focus determine sensitive clinically relevant change cortical metric may indicate need explore different intervention use validation study . We choose use Memantine XR® impact NMDA neurotransmission , current evaluation large multi-site randomize ASD clinical trial whose initial result expect shortly , observation clinical improvement good tolerability ongoing trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cortical Metrics Assessment Outcome Measure Development Autism With Memantine Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Youth ASD age 8-12 year undergo cortical metric test ( test ability discriminate vibration small brush top hand various condition ) prior treatment memantine XR . They treat memantine XR target dose 14milligrams daily 8 week . At end 8 week , cortical metric test repeat . Within-subject change cortical metric test baseline endpoint examine describe . Potential relationship change clinical rating scale cortical metric examine . Data utilized inform decision continue explore utility cortical metric detect change brain function youth ASD response therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>
