	<brief_title>The Effects Onion-Pumpkin Extract Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension become one common diseases world consider public health challenge due association morbidity mortality increase cost society . Hypertension important risk factor cardiovascular disease coronary heart disease , stroke , congestive heart failure , peripheral vascular disease . One fourth adult United States high blood pressure among , black elderly high incidence hypertension . This condition characterize abnormally high blood pressure systolic great 140 mmHg diastolic great 90 mmHg ( 1 ) . Lowering blood pressure link 35 % 40 % reduction incidence stroke , 20 % -25 % myocardial infarction , 50 % heart failure . Management hypertension include lifestyle modification pharmacological therapy antihypertensive drug . Lifestyle modification weight reduction overweight obese individual , 8-week diet fruit , vegetable , low-fat dairy product , whole grain , poultry fish nut limited fat , red meat sweet , reduction dietary sodium , physical activity , moderation alcohol consumption show low blood pressure . There several class antihypertensive drug , include angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARBs ) β-blockers ( BBs ) , calcium channel blocker ( CCBs ) thiazide-class diuretic . Among , diuretic base therapy effective treatment prevent cardiovascular disease demonstrate Antihypertensive Lipid-lowering Treatment prevent Heart Attack ( ALLHAT ) trial ( 1 , 2 ) . Blood pressure lower without use prescription drug . Nutraceuticals find application treatment hypertension . Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid , omega-9 fatty acid , garlic , seaweed , various vitamin mineral show reduce blood pressure significantly ( 3 ) . Animal study demonstrate potential benefit onion hypertensive rat . In one study involve rat feed control diet high-fat high-sucrose diet without Welsh onion 4 week , low blood pressure observe rat onion diet , especially green-leafy type . In addition , rat high level nitric oxide ( NO ) metabolites urine plasma , low activity NADH/NADPH oxidase aorta , suppress angiotensin II production ( 4 ) . The mechanism antihypertensive effect onion probably involve increase save NO ( 4 , 5 ) . A randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial also demonstrate significant decrease arterial blood pressure reduction plasma viscosity five hour administration formulation contain onion olive oil ( 6 ) . Pumpkin use traditional medicine know antidiabetic , antitumor , antibacterial , anti-inflammatory , antihypertensive property ( 7 ) . Animal study confirm pumpkin seed oil supplementation result low systolic diastolic blood pressure well improvement lipid profile non-ovariectomized ovariectomized rat ( 8 ) . Using enzyme assay , demonstrate pumpkin moderate high alpha-glucosidase ACE inhibitory activity ( 9 ) . A recent clinical trial involve postmenopausal woman effect supplement pumpkin seed oil cholesterol level . The result trial show 12-week administration 2g/day pumpkin seed oil lead significant increase HDL cholesterol significant decrease diastolic blood pressure . Pumpkin seed oil also improve menopausal symptom score decrease hot flush , headache , joint pain ( 10 ) . This open-label , adaptive-design , pilot study design evaluate effect Onion-Pumpkin Extract support healthy blood pressure assess change systolic diastolic blood pressure . The effect product glucose metabolism , lipid level , antioxidant level would also determine . Tolerability safety study product would also investigate .</detailed_description>
