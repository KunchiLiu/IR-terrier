	<detailed_description>Experimental Design/Procedural Methods : Study Objectives : The CPMC early arthritis registry recruit participant population new patient undergoing evaluation office participate physician . Patients enrol registry undergo longitudinal observation sampling . The investigator collect questionnaire data create biological sample repository . The information obtain use generate hypothesis aim explain environmental genetic factor interrelate influence UA disease outcomes . Analysis perform patient 's data biological sample order ; A. Assess epidemiological clinical characteristic patient early arthritis referral pool CPMC . B. Analyze phenotype genotype peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) individual patient base chemokine/cytokine secretion , cell adhesion molecule expression , gene expression , DNA methylation non cod RNA profile . C. Generate hypothesis aim identify clinical criterion novel biomarkers use diagnosis , prognosis , therapeutic decision patient early UA . Design : A . Prospective longitudinal registry . B . Participants : Any patient undergoing evaluation arthritis consider eligible . The pool potential subject include patient present office participate physician evaluation arthritis . As estimate , Pacific Rheumatology Associates , private practice office San Francisco , perform approximately 1000 consultation 2013 undiagnosed arthritis . C. Entry criterion include least 18 year old screening visit , able understand information give give write informed consent , willingness comply requirement data collection , absence diagnose autoimmune disease inflammatory arthritis , absence previous treatment disease modify anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARD ) . We exclude patient pregnant intend become pregnant time follow . Healthy control subject recruit base similar criterion study subject . Our effort include age gender match control subject registry . We also aim match environmental characteristic ( i.e . partner live location registry subject radius 10 mile least one year previous date evaluation ) genetic background ( i.e . ask participation first-degree relative ) . D. Measurements : . Demographics , clinical , environmental characteristic : Patients control fill epidemiological survey main demographic characteristic ( i.e . age , gender , ethnicity , etc ) , clinical characteristic ( i.e . past medical history , family history , medication allergy , medication ) environmental characteristic ( socio-economic status , sleep habit , tobacco exposure , diet , etc . ) ii . Outcomes : 1 . A Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) 6 , Sleep Questionnaire 7 , semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire 8 applied date initial evaluation patient control . These questionnaire administer participant considers her/his symptom improve she/he fail initial therapeutic intervention . At point also include appropriate control subject sampling . Patients DAS28 score calculate physician medical evaluation . 2 . Patient 's follow either personal phone interview initial visit six , 12 , 24 month order record definitive diagnosis inflammatory arthritis . 3 . A participant request provide blood sample initial evaluation visit and/or active disease phase disease activity first office visit . Another blood sample collect initial therapeutic intervention regardless whether inactive low activity disease phase per patient 's subjective assessment . Follow interview whenever require personal visit conduct office participate physician . iii . Blood sample : Our objective create repository include PBMCs serum sample suitable functional assay well nucleic acid analysis . These effort make cohort unique source measure PBMC antigen-specific proliferation , cytokine chemokine secretion , activation marker expression among others . As described , participant ask donate blood sample period disease activity period disease inactivity low activity calculate DAS28 score . Blood fractionate serum analysis cell analysis . PBMCs sort neutrophil , B cell , T cell , monocyte . Cells use RNA DNA extraction analysis , functional assay involve cytokine chemokine production , cell proliferation , expression surface marker activation . Serum cell store CPMC Research Institute . Serum sample store -70Â° C use soluble cytokine chemokine analysis . Sorted cell collect RNA-preserving medium store liquid nitrogen use nucleic acid analysis ( mRNA , small RNA , cDNA , genomic DNA ) . An additional sample PBMCs collect dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) store liquid nitrogen use functional assay include cell proliferation activation marker expression . iv . Imaging : We request copy radiological assessment relate patient work diagnosis evaluation arthritis . We also register image study relate follow visit . E. HIPAA Informed Consent : Patients eligible invited enroll registry inform consent obtain . Patients provide detailed description aim , expectation , possible complication relate participation study . Participation completely voluntary . The project strictly abide Health Insurance Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) California Confidentiality Medical Information Act subject approval California Pacific Medical Center Institutional Review Board .</detailed_description>
