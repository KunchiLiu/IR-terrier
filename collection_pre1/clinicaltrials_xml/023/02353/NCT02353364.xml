	<brief_summary>The study design evaluate effectiveness pre-implantation genetic screening ( PGS ) infertility patient advance maternal age undergoing assist reproductive treatment . Half patient embryos test PGS 1 2 chromosomally normal embryos high morphological grading transplant back uterus . The half participant embryos test 1 2 untested embryo high morphological grading transplant back uterus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PGS assist reproductive technology screen patient embryos , discriminate embryos normal set chromosome ( euploid ) abnormal set chromosome ( aneuploid ) . In study , apply novel validate next generation sequence technology call copy number variation sequence ( CNV-Seq ) comprehensively screen trophectoderm biopsy sample patient 's embryo chromosomal abnormality commonly arise human embryo . The hypothesis PGS perform use CNV-Seq embryo produce patient poor prognosis pregnancy ( maternal age &gt; 35 ) , follow transfer chromosomally normal euploid embryo , result significantly high implantation , pregnancy live birth rate low miscarriage rate compare patient PGS .</detailed_description>
