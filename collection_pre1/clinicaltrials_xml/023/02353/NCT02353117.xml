	<detailed_description>Scope : The investigator use implementation research method evaluate multifaceted intervention increase use evidence-based clinical procedure prevent congenital syphilis . Improving syphilis screen treatment promote key step toward improve quality component prenatal care . The objective increase frequency pregnant woman attend prenatal care screen syphilis treat infect ( primary outcome ) . The investigator also measure impact intervention component prenatal care ( screen anemia , HIV , proteinuria ) ( secondary outcome ) . Approach : Design : Facility-based , two-arm parallel cluster randomize implementation trial . Clusters correspond geographic area several prenatal clinic . After six-month period baseline data collection , cluster randomize either intervention group control group . For 18 month , prenatal clinic intervention cluster conduct multifaceted intervention . The prenatal clinic control cluster continue usual activity . Data collect intervention period compare baseline data . Sample Size : The investigator assume 300 woman initiate prenatal care per cluster year . A sample size 20 cluster ( 10 per arm ) three woman seropositive syphilis per cluster achieve 80 % power detect increase treat woman 50 % 85 % , significance level test 0.05 , intracluster correlation coefficient 0.01 . This give 90 % power detect increase number woman complete screen 50 % 75 % . Calculations base conservative assumption 50 % woman screen 50 % treated baseline ; low screening treatment rate baseline would increase power propose study . Settings : DRC ( 10 cluster ) , Zambia ( 10 cluster ) , Argentina ( Data Center ) . - In DRC , study perform Maluku Nsele health area , locate within capital city-province Kinshasa . - In Zambia , study perform health area Kafue Chongwe , locate within capital province Lusaka . - The Data Center locate Buenos Aires , Argentina . Intervention : The intervention multifaceted , tailor formative research , include : 1 . Opinion leader , reminder , monitoring , feedback ; 2 . Point-of-care rapid test immediate treatment rapid test positive ; 3 . Locally package treatment kit ( benzathine penicillin 2.4 MIU , syringe needle , instruction , information side-effects ) . Even though screen treatment occur early possible pregnancy , benefit expect stage pregnancy . No woman exclude base gestational age . Opinion leader intervention prenatal clinic identify peer invite work `` facilitator . '' Training include : content prenatal care package recommend WHO need improve quality component prenatal care ; importance maternal congenital syphilis case management base WHO recommendation ; screen point-of-care rapid test same-day treatment find positive ; manage allergy penicillin ; ensure pregnant woman screen ; conduct one-on-one detail visit prenatal clinic provider discuss view regard implementation screen treatment program . After complete training , facilitator return prenatal clinic implement program , include train prenatal care provider conduct personal visit discuss perspectives potential barrier . The facilitator responsible place treatment kit convenient sit ensure ease use infected woman develop simple reminder place consultation office patient wait area . The facilitator team also produce periodical report rate syphilis screen treatment distribute report prenatal care provider . Cluster coordinator meet periodically team ass completion activity address unexpected problem . The intervention refine , take account information obtain formative research phase . Thus , component describe may modify formative research stage . Activities Control Clinics : As standard training procedure , prenatal care provider control clinic invited participate half-day training workshop . They give refresher concept prenatal care package maternal congenital syphilis train syphilis case detection management , use standard available screen method . Additionally , train document screen treatment process , use system intervention clinic . No activity plan control group , prenatal care provider encourage disseminate implement strategy consider useful improve screen treatment process . Study personnel ensure availability screen test already in-use , well ensure availability benzathine penicillin control prenatal clinic .</detailed_description>
