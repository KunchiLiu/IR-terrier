	<brief_summary>The purpose determine use rectal spacers effective improve protection rectum high dose radiation , use rate rectal ulceration surrogate measure acute effect . It also determine whether provide sufficient dosimetric benefit warrant clinical investigation future SABR ( Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiation ) relate clinical study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy ( SABR ) Low Risk Prostate Cancer With Injectable Rectal Spacer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase II study ass safety efficacy spacer injection process , ability spacer effectively provide space necessary reduce acute event rectum , also meet SABR base rectal constraint , monitor stability process SABR . Unlike IMRT , use small dose/fraction , use high dose/fraction , even mm shift spacer positioning may impact dose rectum receives , therefore , rigorous study stability material SABR treatment need determine . If shift , study , may able determine margin error necessary consider rectal organ dosimetry , base possible shift positiong may occur spacer time . As SABR therapy strictly local , select patient prostate cancer locally confine prostate gland . As , select eligibility criterion low risk patient minimize risk extraprostatic spread , seminal vesicle invasion , nodal spread . Hormonal therapy may also use shrink prostates massively enlarge may also help reduce length rectum irradiate . As primary toxicity likely mucosal damage , avoid enrol patient pre-existing mucosal dysfunction ( include previous radiation , TURP , large prostate gland , inflammatory bowel disease ) immunosuppressed individual base phase I experience [ 13 ] . In way , patient uniformly select fashion would identify patient likely receive benefit therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient must willing capable provide inform consent participate protocol . Eligible patient must appropriate stag study identify AJCC stage T1 ( , b , c ) T2a T2b adenocarcinoma prostate gland . The patient direct evidence regional distant metastasis appropriate stag study . Histologic confirmation cancer require biopsy perform within 180 day registration . The patient 's Zubrod performance status must 02 . The Gleason score less equal 6 3+4 &lt; 50 % 12 core biopsy involve . The serum PSA le equal 10 ng/ml . Study entry PSA must obtain follow time frame : 10 day period follow prostate biopsy ; follow initiation ADT ; within 30 day discontinuation finasteride ; within 90 day discontinuation dutasteride . Age ≥ 18 year . Patients may use prior hormonal therapy , limit 9 month therapy prior enrollment . The ultrasound , CT base volume estimation patient 's prostate gland ≤ 60 gram . Subjects previous pelvic radiotherapy chemotherapy surgery prostate cancer . Subjects plan receive concomitant post treatment adjuvant antineoplastic therapy protocol include surgery , cryotherapy , conventionally fractionate radiotherapy , hormonal therapy , chemotherapy give part treatment prostate cancer . Subjects undergone previous transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) cryotherapy prostate . Subjects significant urinary obstructive symptom ; AUA score must ≤15 ( alpha blocker allow ) . Subjects history significant psychiatric illness . Men reproductive potential agree partner use effective contraceptive method condom/diaphragm spermacidal foam , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , prescription birth control pill . Prior invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) unless disease free minimum 3 year ( e.g. , carcinoma situ breast , oral cavity , cervix permissible ) . Severe , active comorbidity , define follow : Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within last 6 month . Transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month . Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration . Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation respiratory illness require hospitalization preclude study therapy within 30 day registration . Hepatic insufficiency result clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defect ; note , however , laboratory test liver function coagulation parameter require entry protocol . Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) base upon current CDC definition ; note , however , HIV test require entry protocol . The need exclude patient AIDS protocol necessary treatment involve protocol may significantly immunosuppressive . Protocolspecific requirement may also exclude immunocompromised patient . Patients history inflammatory colitis ( include Crohn 's Disease Ulcerative colitis ) eligible . Subjects know allergy polyethylene glycol hydrogel ( spacer material ) contraindication spacer product ( Duraseal SpaceOAR ) . Subjects evidence extraprostatic extension ( T3a ) seminal vesicle involvement ( T3b ) clinical evaluation .</criteria>
