	<detailed_description>Initially , write consent obtain participant . Then become familiar procedure . For intrarater reliability , first rater assessed strength pinch grip , elbow flexion shoulder abduction three different session short interval day environmental condition . All assessment perform day three session . Assessment duration session 5 minute . For inter-rater reliability , Before begin Procedure raters familiarize motricity index . The motricity index administer two different raters subject within 2 day blind others result heir result record separately . PATIENT POSITION The patient sit chair edge bed , test lie supine necessary . In arm three movement test pinch grip , elbow flexion shoulder abduction . Pinch grip Assessed ask patient grip 2.5 cm cube thumb fore finger . The object flat surface ( example , book ) . The tester score contraction forearm small hand muscle follow : 0 No movement . 11 Beginnings prehension ( movement finger thumb ) . 19 Able grip cube , hold gravity ( examiner may need lift wrist ) 22 Able grip hold cube gravity , weak pull . 26 Able grip hold cube weak pull , weak side . 33 Normal pinch grip . Elbow flexion The elbow test elbow flexed 90° , forearm horizontal upper arm vertical . The patient ask bend elbow hand touch shoulder . The examiner resist hand wrist , monitor biceps . If movement , examiner hold elbow arm horizontal , give score 14 movement see . Shoulder abduction The elbow fully flexed chest patient ask abduct arm . The examiner monitor contraction deltoid movement shoulder girdle count-there must movement humerus relation scapula ) . A score 19 give shoulder abduct 90◦ beyond horizontal gravity resistance . According quality muscle contraction score record . Rater also aware trick motion lean back movement place one hand back . Finally , three score sum Motricity Index upper extremity calculate .</detailed_description>
