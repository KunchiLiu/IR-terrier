	<brief_summary>Negative symptom significantly interfere daily functioning among individual schizophrenia . They strongly relate functional impairment [ 1 ] contribute poor community outcome Veterans schizophrenia . Motivational negative symptom interfere obtain maintain employment [ 2 ] , form social relationship [ 3 ] live independently [ 4 ] . Developing treatment effectively reduce negative symptom important achieve improvement daily functioning . Recent empirical study report psychosocial intervention negative symptom moderate large effect size community function negative symptom severity . However , treatment utilize far either cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention require year weekly individual session thus resource- time-intensive , skills-training group address cognitive motivational aspect negative symptom . Although group treatment increasingly hail gold standard schizophrenia , currently group intervention explicitly motivational negative symptom functional deficit . Furthermore , treatment development clinical trial increasingly reliant neurophysiological measure clinical severity treatment response far identify negative symptom biomarkers . The current CDA proposal test group-based treatment base establish motivational enhancement ( MI ) technique , augment cognitive-behavioral approach , compare active control group treatment , improve motivational negative symptom Veterans schizophrenia . I assess efficacy MI measure two outcome domain : 1 ) negative symptom ( clinical rating ) 2 ) functional outcome ( real-world improvement social , instrumental , independent living ) . I assess relationship outcome neurophysiological biomarkers ( pupillometry electroencephalography ( EEG ) ) . Participants randomly assign MI treatment control treatment weekly 1-hour session 12 week . The assessment battery administer baseline , completion treatment , 6-month follow-up . The investigator enroll 60 Veterans schizophrenia low functioning high negative symptom across 4 year study . This proposal design examine group-based MI reduce negative symptom improve function key domain ( i.e. , interpersonal , instrumental , independent living skill ) . Moreover , thoroughly investigate biomarkers negative symptom pupillometry EEG . The development evaluation recovery- orient group MI treatment Veterans disable negative symptom yield result inform large treatment trial neurophysiological measurement negative symptom Veterans schizophrenia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite significant advance pharmacological treatment schizophrenia ( SCZ ) , rate disability among Veterans diagnose SCZ remain high . Functional disability among Veterans SCZ create huge costly burden national VA healthcare system , interfere community integration quality life . In particular , SCZ associate low rate employment , social relationship , poor independent living skill . The negative symptom SCZ ( i.e . avolition , anhedonia , asociality ) primary determinant functional impairment , validate treatment . Extensive work devote treat positive symptom cognitive deficit , much less do develop pharmacological psychosocial treatment negative symptom . Developing intervention critical public health goal , would benefit one large group disable Veterans . The recently-emerging recovery-oriented approach serious mental illness reflect fundamental shift focus symptom reduction focus patient ' goal community function . Developing treatment negative symptom augment community function strong reflection shift . Importantly , preliminary research suggest motivational negative symptom respond novel evidence-based psychosocial intervention . The primary goal proposal adapt implement recovery-oriented evidence-based intervention , Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) , treatment motivational negative symptom Veterans SCZ . MI , originally develop substance use disorder , effective increase commitment new behavior range area include treatment adherence , exercise , gambling , depression . Importantly , show applicable Veterans psychosis , know MI reduce functional deficit attributable motivational negative symptom . More specifically , scientific goal proposal : 1 ) evaluate efficacy group-based MI intervention motivational negative symptom Veterans SCZ , 2 ) examine potential biomarkers negative symptom treatment response . I assess efficacy MI measure two outcome domain : 1 ) negative symptom ( clinical rating ) 2 ) functional outcome ( real-world improvement social , instrumental , independent living ) . I assess relationship outcome neurophysiological biomarkers ( pupillometry electroencephalography ( EEG ) ) . To address question , 60 Veterans SCZ least moderate level motivational negative symptom randomly assign 1:1 ratio MI standard treatment ( relaxation skill train ) . Both treatment consist weekly 60-min group session twelve week . The assessment administer baseline , completion treatment , 6-month follow-up . Specific Aim # 1 : To adapt exist MI approach group-based MI treatment Veterans SCZ . Specific Aim # 2 : To examine treatment effect MI compare control procedure motivational negative symptom functional outcome . Hypothesis 2a : Individuals receive MI significant improvement motivational negative symptom , compare receive control . Hypothesis 2b : Individuals receive MI significant improvement aspect function include social , instrumental , independent living domain , compare receive control . Specific Aim # 3 : To examine neurophysiological biomarkers ( i.e. , EEG pupillometry ) motivational negative symptom severity treatment response . Hypothesis 3a : At baseline , subject negative symptom baseline aberrant EEG pupillary measure . Hypothesis 3b : For subject treatment group , change biomarkers ( toward normalization ) study duration correlate treatment related improvement motivational negative symptom . Exploratory Aim : To explore causal model examine whether MI improve defeatist belief compare control procedure . Although MI well-established intervention range clinical population condition , propose project first examination MI group format motivational negative symptom SCZ . If validate , could disseminate throughout VA patient population motivational functional deficit ( e.g. , traumatic brain injury , post-traumatic stress disorder ) . Therefore , CDA application facilitate research independence provide unique combination skill equip local professional resource long-term VA researcher .</detailed_description>
