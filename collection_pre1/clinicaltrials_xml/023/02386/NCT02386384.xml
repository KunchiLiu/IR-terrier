	<brief_title>TNFα MFG-E8 : Novel Biomarkers Predict Implantation Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize TNFα MFG-E8 cooperatively maintain integrity normal endometrium , patient IF recurrent pregnancy loss ( RPL ) unexplained origin , excessive TNFα increase maternal shed MFG-E8 , disrupt normal protective effect protein , result damage endometrial epithelium impair trophoblast invasion . The investigator propose molecule measure local tissue ( endometrium ) well serum reflection increase inflammation therefore use marker implantation failure . The investigator hypothesis TNFα up-regulated serum woman implantation defect ( IF RM unexplained origin ) cause perturbation MFG-E8 secretion . These result provide first evidence demonstrate endometrial dysfunction result over-expression pro-inflammatory molecule . The release significant quantity molecule serum broaden maternal-fetal interface beyond uterus maternal circulation . The characterization molecules essential good understand , biological effect , also potential prognostic diagnostic biomarkers detection IF . More importantly , molecule could potential therapeutic target ( perhaps intrauterine infusion MFG-E8 tissue repair , and/or oral administration TNFα antagonist ) improve implantation outcome . Two recent study report successful therapeutic use recombinant human MFG-E8 ( rhMFG-E8 ) animal : one use decrease intestinal injury whole body radiation ( Ajakaiye et al , 2012 ) , mitigate inflammation tissue injury hemorrhagic stroke ( Wang et al , 2012 ) . Also , TNFα inhibitor show significantly increase IVF outcome infertile patient ( Winger et al , 2009 2008 ) . In summary , two pivotal study show promising clinical us rhMFG-E8 tissue repair/remodeling decrease apoptosis , provide basis use candidate clinical development reproductive health . Objectives : Here , investigator seek delineate novel diagnostic method ultimate long term goal design directed therapy improve embryo implantation competence . - The specific aim quantify correlate MFG-E8 TNFα serum endometrial biopsy woman 3 group : control , IF RM . - The ultimate goal study provide data lead simple quick test measure soluble serum marker IF/RM order discriminate prospectively group patient . - To translate finding use modulators inflammatory molecule improve pregnancy rate patient predict implantation defect . It widely know `` classic '' marker endometrial receptivity provide invasive endometrial biopsy ( Hematoxilin-Eosin staining , immuhistochemistry , even microarray technology ) reliable establish clear-cut diagnosis due cycle-to-cycle variation overlap result .</detailed_description>
