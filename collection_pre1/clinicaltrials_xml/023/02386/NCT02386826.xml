	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether combination two agent , INC280 bevacizumab , safe effective administer patient receive prior therapy Glioblastoma Multiforme ( GBM ) , metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) , metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) progress therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>INC280 Combined With Bevacizumab Evaluate Glioblastoma Multiforme , Metastatic Colorectal Cancer , Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite recent advance , glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) remain incurable malignancy short expect survival . Treatment option also limit patient metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) progress prior therapy . Novel target therapy study treat patient population . c-MET signal promotes invasive growth describe various cancer . INC280 highly potent selective c-MET inhibitor also penetrate blood-brain barrier . In open-label , multicenter Phase 1b study , investigator first determine optimal dose INC280 combine bevacizumab administer ≥ second-line therapy GBM/gliosarcoma patient . After optimal dose drug combination determine , enrollment expand include GBM mRCC patient progress ≥ first-line therapy , mCRC patient progress ≥ second-line therapy . The study provide preliminary safety pharmacokinetic ( PK ) assessment INC280/bevacizumab combination .</detailed_description>
