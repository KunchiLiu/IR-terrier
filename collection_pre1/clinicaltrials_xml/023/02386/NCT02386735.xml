	<brief_summary>Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) major public health issue curative treatment . In Switzerland estimate 5-7 % total population suffer chronic disease . According current guideline corticosteroid part treatment acute exacerbation COPD patient . Several study suggest corticosteroid accelerate recovery force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) , decrease duration hospitalization , reduce treatment failure rate improve clinical outcome . The additional therapeutic benefit FEV1-recovery tough seem last three five day . The investigator recently publish hospital-based study show patient present emergency department acute exacerbation COPD , short five day treatment systemic steroid inferior conventional 14 day treatment regard re-exacerbation . Cumulative corticosteroid dose could reduce trial . To investigator knowledge data available minimal necessary corticosteroid dose outpatient treatment set far . Aim The primary aim study investigate outpatient setting , whether three day treatment orally administer systemic corticosteroid non-inferior five day treatment acute exacerbation COPD total glucocorticoid exposure reduce short therapy . Hypothesis The investigator postulate , outpatient setting , generally less severe exacerbation treat , three day treatment duration systemic corticosteroid non-inferior five day treatment duration regard treatment benefit decrease cumulative corticosteroid exposure . Design Setting This study go perform prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , non-inferiority trial outpatient set . Randomization perform block randomization 1:1 allocation . The investigator go recruit GPs northwestern central Switzerland . Methods The investigator go include patient present GP 's acute exacerbation COPD . When match investigator eligibility criterion write informed consent give , patient include study receive systemic corticosteroid treatment ( equivalent 40mg prednisone daily ) either five day ( conventional arm ) three day ( interventional arm ) follow two day placebo interventional group . Pre-randomized , identically look , numbered blister give patient include study . Antibiotic treatment ( Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid , 625mg 3/d , ten day ) give patient CRP ≥50mg/l , COPD know diagnosis bronchiectasis , well patient present three follow symptom : change baseline dyspnea , change sputum quantity sputum purulence . Further initial treatment steroid treatment inclusion determine documented GP . Patients undergo follow-up visit day three seven GP well follow-up phone call execute study center day 30 , 90 180 .</brief_summary>
