	<detailed_description>Using crossover design , compare effect placebo angiotensin II receptor antagonist urinary sodium excretion response obese normotensive subject untreated hypertensive African-Americans subject . We expect urinary sodium excretion response angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy less overweight/obese hypertensive subject compare overweight/obese normotensive subject . This study also employ double blind placebo control cross-over drug study . All subject qualify participate study fall overweight/obese category BMI rate 25 kg/m2 high . Half subject normotensive half drug naïve hypertensive . The normotensive subject identify described Studies 1 2 . The difference need BMI great equal 25 kg/m2 . The hypertensive subject identify Dr. White team hypertension clinic . These patient restrict currently anti-hypertensive therapy . This study involve screen visit , two first dose visit two test week approximate 5 week period ( include one week `` washout '' period ) . Each test week 3 day salt-controlled diet prior test approximate 3-hour testing period Day 4 . The 3-hour testing period include 10 minute baseline rest , 45 minute mild stress ( competitive video game ) , 45 minute recovery rest . A total 4 blood 4 urine sample collect 3-hour period . Each blood draw consist 7 teaspoon total 28 teaspoon per week . If female , pregnancy test perform begin test visit ( screen , first dose-1 , test day-1 , first dose -2 test day-2 ) confirm pregnant . The week testing , subject come Georgia Prevention Institute Children 's Research Unit First Dose Visit meet one study physician give instruction take Avapro . This appointment last 2 ½ hour . They take first dose Avapro placebo monitor next 2 hour . If female subject , provide urine sample pregnancy test make sure pregnant give first dose study medication . During time , blood pressure take every 15 minute . During screen test , subject ask take MoCA ( Montreal Cognitive Assessment ) test order measure cognitive thinking stress . It brief 30-question test take around 10 minute complete . It measure different type cognitive ability , include orientation ( approximate position something/someone ) , short-term memory ( remember information short period time ) , executive function ( plan problem solve ) , language ability ( assign appropriate name appropriate item ) , visuospatial ability ( determine distance one object another ) . Each question award particular number point depend accuracy answer give . We look see total number point earn change response stress . During screen visit , subject take MoCA test take approximately 10 minute . Someone research team instruct subject question answer one best ability . On test day , nurse/phlebotomist insert small needle attach plastic tube call catheter vein hand arm . This procedure allow nurse/phlebotomist collect 4 blood sample 3-hour testing period . The needle stick may cause temporary pain may result black blue mark . A device automatically take blood pressure put opposite arm . The subject also give water sip duration test . Before test begin , subject instruct take last dose medication . During first 10 minute baseline rest period , relax recline chair . They listen music , read book magazine watch movie pass time . Blood pressure take 10 minute rest period . Once baseline rest period , blood urine sample collect . During stress period , subject play video game another subject 45 minute . Blood pressure continue measure every 10 minute . They also continue sip water time . At end game , another blood urine sample collect . The subject ask complete MoCA test second time . It question ask screen visit . A research team member instruct subject answer question answer best ability . The last 45 minute recovery period relaxation first ( reading , listen music watch movie ) . Blood pressure continue take every 10 minute . Once 45 minute end last blood urine sample collect testing day complete . They repeat whole process second time . During test day one test day two , subject Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometer ( DEXA ) scan Peripheral Quantitative Computer Tomography ( pQCT ) scan perform The DEXA ass bone mineral density ( BMD ) , body fat percentage lean tissue . The pQCT ass bone strength radius tibia . For The DEXA , subject remove item may contain metal - include jewelry , belt , shoe piercings . A gown provide need . The subject lie table approximately 6 minute , table rotates mechanical arm move subject body measure BMI . For pQCT , subject seat position forearm pQCT device remain still 3-5 minute . They place low leg device another 3-5 minute scan . If subject female , pregnancy test perform test begin test visit order confirm subject pregnant . Bone Body Composition Measurements Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry perform baseline posttest ass total body composition . The body composition variables interest fat-free soft tissue mass fat mass . Peripheral quantitative compute tomography perform baseline visit ass bone strength radius tibia . During scan , participant must place forearm low leg pQCT unit remain still three five minute ( actual scan duration ) . For forearm scan , participant seat chair side pQCT unit . The participant sits close possible unit . The shoulder close front side gantry . The armrest machine adjust measure forearm length . The elbow fix corner armrest Velcro strap distal forearm fix clamp . The angle upper arm forearm exceed 90° . The hand lie hand rest . The fixation arm prevent movement artifact must hurt . The participant ask search convenient natural position avoid movement discomfort scan period 3-5 minute . For low leg scan , participant seat chair front pQCT unit . When machine start position , participant 's low leg move gantry foot rest foot holder . With foot holder position way front pQCT unit , low leg center fix concentric acrylic cylinder ( diameter 18 cm ) , locate gantry opening . The foot fix Velcro strap foot holder . Before scan , participant ask find convenient natural position reduce movement artifact 3-5 minute scan . Radial tibial measurement take 4 % 20 % sit bone outcome , proximal articular surface distal end tibia radius . The 4 % 20 % site represent area high trabecular cortical bone , respectively . Each scan acquire 0.4 mm voxel size slice thickness 2.4 mm . The anatomic reference line ( determination distal end radius tibia ) identify acquisition 30 mm planar scout view joint line automatically set software 4 % 20 % site . Image process calculation bone measure determine use Stratec software ( version 6.02 ) . At trabecular site radius tibia , total volumetric bone mineral density ( vBMD , mg/cm3 ) total cross-sectional area ( CSA , mm2 ) measure calculate bone strength index ( BSI ; mg2/mm4 , Equation 1 ) , estimate bone 's ability withstand compressional strain . At cortical bone sit radius tibia , cortical vBMD ( mg/cm3 ) , cortical CSA ( mm2 ) , cortical thickness ( mm ) measure calculate strength-strain index ( SSI , mm3 ) , reflect torsional bone strength . The SSI calculate integrated product section modulus density cortical bone ( Equation 2 ) . Section modulus calculate ( x d2 ) /dmax , CSA voxel , distance voxel center gravity , dmax maximum distance one voxel center gravity . The ratio cortical vBMD normal physiological density ( ND = 1200 mg/cm3 ) provide estimate modulus elasticity .</detailed_description>
