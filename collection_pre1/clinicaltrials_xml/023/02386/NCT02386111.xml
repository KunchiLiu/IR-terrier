	<brief_title>A Study Varlilumab ( Anti-CD27 ) Sunitinib Patients With Metastatic Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Varlilumab fully human monoclonal antibody bind molecule call CD27 find certain immune cell may act promote anti-tumor effect . Sunitinib small molecule inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTKs ) play role tumor growth progression cancer . This study evaluate safety , tolerability efficacy anti-CD27 antibody varlilumab combination sunitinib . Eligible patient enroll dose escalation portion study assign one three dose level varlilumab combination 50 mg sunitinib . The first phase study test safety profile combination determine dose varlilumab study Phase overall study . During Phase , 40 patient enrol receive recommended Phase dose varlilumab combination sunitinib 50 mg. All patient enrol study closely monitor determine response treatment well side effect may occur .</detailed_description>
