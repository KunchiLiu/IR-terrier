	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . -to determine whether benznidazole ( BZN ) able modify natural evolution chronic Chagas disease adult patient mean randomized , double-blind clinical trial ( RCT ) . Also : 2 . -to validate therapeutic efficacy new method , recombinant antigen F29 Trypanosoma cruzi visualize conventional ELISA , context RCT compare conventional serology ( CS ) 3 . -to develop real-time polymerase chain-reaction ( RT-PCR ) quantify parasite load early therapeutic effect . 4. determine potential serological parasitological method predictor therapeutic effect failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etiologic Treatment With Benznidazole Adult Patients With Chronic Chagas Disease . A Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Methods . Patients select enrolled born Chagas disease endemic area Argentina border country Bolivia Paraguay , whose current residence urban non endemic area Argentina . They sort clinical stage : stage 0 , 1 , 2 3 accord modify Kuschnir classification.1 Briefly , Stage 0 correspond patient reactive serology Chagas disease ; stage 1 , patient reactive serology plus electrocardiographic abnormality ; stage 2 , patient abovementioned characteristic plus dilatation leave ventricle echocardiography , stage 3 , patient abovementioned characteristic , plus cardiac failure . The follow-up perform every 4 month first 2 year , every 6 month 3rd 4th year , annually end study 2012 . The safety TRAENA control day 25 45 intra-treatment mean laboratory test clinical evaluation , time adverse event apparent patient . Adherence medication administration verify mean booklet patient record daily intake medication physical abnormality appear time take medicine . Adherence control surveillance recovery system consist telephone call , telegram , letter home visit term `` active monitoring '' , immediately apply control visit patient attend correspond schedule control . Telephone call useful tool recover adherence monitoring . Patients assign BZN Placebo treatment investigator independent research group . Prior randomization , pre randomization stratification perform accord prognostic factor base clinical stage Chagas disease . A database design use registry whole study . Demographic , epidemiologic , serologic , parasitological clinical variable use design , register pre treatment , intra treatment post treatment throughout monitoring . Medical record primary document registry , variable record manually . Based data , variable register daily basis random weekly check conduct data medical record . Our Standard Operating Procedure base follow procedure : patient screening , selection coding , sample collection , serum bank , DNA sample storage , monitor systematization , surveillance system recover patient discontinue monitoring , etc . In October 2011 Base Data Monitoring Board last Interim Analysis , recommend addendum modify secondary outcome , add simple combined event . These event characterize electrocardiographic abnormality associate echocardiographic one . These event evaluate April 2013 .</detailed_description>
