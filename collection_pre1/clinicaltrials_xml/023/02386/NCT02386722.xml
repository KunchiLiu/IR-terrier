	<brief_summary>Asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) common lung . Despite important progress achieve treatment , majority affect patient suffer severe symptom tend frequently hospitalise due exacerbation . Reasons uncontrolled asthma COPD manifold , often poor inhalation technique poor follow prescribed treatment plan observe , call non-adherence . The primary aim study therefore measure medication adherence patient chronic obstructive lung disease , investigate impact audio reminder disease outcomes quality life . The investigator hypotheses adherence reminder , improve medication adherence good medication adherence elongate time next exacerbation patient chronic obstructive lung disease . A prospective single-blind randomize control study plan , investigator go analyse adherence period six month in- outpatient , experience least one exacerbation last year . The adherence intervention- control group measure specific electronic data capture device save actuation date time . Patients assigned intervention group remind inhalation audio reminder receive support call medication take prescribed rescue medication use often . In contrast , control group , remind receive call , comply prescribed medication schedule use rescue medication frequently . During study period , participant assess every two month . Each assessment include spirometry , measurement diffusion capacity , exhale nitric oxide carbon monoxide . Moreover participant demonstrate inhalation technique use placebo device fill questionnaire regard quality life . Statistical significance acquire p value le 0.05 attain . Time next exacerbation compare use Kaplan-Meier method Cox proportional hazard model . Results report HR ( hazard ratio ) correspond 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) p-value . `` Time next exacerbation '' subject investigator power calculation . A previous study show 30 % COPD patient readmitted within six month exacerbation . The investigator expect 12 % patient intervention group exacerbation . This correspond hazard ratio 0.36 . Assuming sample size 70 subject study group , power 80 % detect HR 0.36 base one-tailed test . Additional 14 subject ( 7 study group ) add account drop out . Therefore , 154 subject investigate study .</brief_summary>
