	<brief_summary>Sickle Cell Disease serious disease life-threatening patient homozygous SS form heterozygous SC bthal form . The CHU Brugmann hospital currently regularly treat 70 homozygous adult patient number constant augmentation . The age average patient 30 . The hospital develop close collaboration Queen Fabiola Kids University Hospital optimize transition young sickle cell patient pediatric adult network . The emergency care sickle cell patient remain source worry . Even correct treatment ( Hydroxy-urea exsanguineous transfusion ) , patient suffer frequent sickle cell disease crisis stress infection cause hemolysis . The pain level intolerable cause emergency hospital admission ( 2 3 crisis per patient per year average ) . The crisis frequent poor compliance treatment . There several obstacle rapid optimal management patient : - fear cause addiction heavy pain releaf product ( high dosis morphine ) - lack biological parameter determination crisis severity . The prognostic value lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) level vaso-occlusive crisis recently stress activation coagulation , translate elevation various parameter include rate DD dimer , seem associated clinical complication . The deleterious role increase oxidative stress also recently demonstrate patient sickle cell disease , open new therapeutic avenue . This study aim prospectively evaluate management sickle cell patient admit emergency department vaso-occlusive crisis . The level satisfaction patient measure . The investigator also evaluate predictive value several routine biological parameter regard severity crisis , include value nitrous albumin ( PNA ) marker oxydative stress . This last dosage make collaboration team Dr Wayenberg Pr Bottari Grenoble .</brief_summary>
