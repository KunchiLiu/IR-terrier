	<brief_title>Activity Regorafenib Combination With Chemotherapy Patients With Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regorafenib ( BAY 73-4506 ) assess metastatic colorectal cancer phase III randomize CORRECT trial . 760 metastatic colorectal cancer patient recruit failure standard therapy . Given promise efficacy favorable tolerability profile mGEMOX potential benefit target VEGF Ras/Raf pathway , propose assess combination Regorafenib mGEMOX advance digestive cancer . This study determine Regorafenib Dose ( RD ) phase II trial Regorafenib administer combination mGEMOX patient advance biliary tract cancer . The phase I study Regorafenib advance colorectal cancer show pronounced interindividual variability drug exposition . Furthermore , CORRECT study show large pharmacological variability plasma concentration Regorafenib metabolites . In study , propose explore pharmacological variability potential heritability therapeutic drug monitoring Regorafenib . The objective understand control pharmacological variability Regorafenib finally predict therapeutic response toxicity , especially population patient biliary tract cancer . In addition , complete study explore gene variant drug metabolism . The gene POR ( P450 OxidoReductase , ) NR1I2 ( Nuclear Receptor subfamily 1 , group I , member 2 ) part regulatory sequence CYP3A4 .</detailed_description>
