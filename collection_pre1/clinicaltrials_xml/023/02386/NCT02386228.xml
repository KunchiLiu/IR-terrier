	<detailed_description>IVH important cause brain injury newborn bear prematurely . Depending severity hemorrhage care provide newborn , impact IVH range temporary issue permanent consequence life-threatening condition severe neurodevelopmental sequela . The outcomes patient IVH dictate direct effect hemorrhage , associate process hydrocephalus , periventricular infarction leukomalacia . Despite availability well diagnostic therapeutic tool , incidence IVH remain constant past 50 year , mostly due increase survival rate low weight premature infant . Recent statistic demonstrate close 12,000 premature infant develop IVH United 'states every year 50 % develop degree posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus ( PHH ) . It believe PHH originates result arachnoiditis , gliosis , subsequent fibrosis impair flow reabsorption cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . Despite lack clarity pathogenesis PHH , well accept presence exacerbate damage cause hemorrhage periventricular white matter . Multiple effort make identify mechanisms mediator development PHH white matter damage . Molecules transform growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) demonstrate enhance expression gene encode fibronectin , collagen extracellular matrix component . Unfortunately , enough evidence generate able envision potential solution problem . The current management PHH focus control damage pressure , distortion , and/or ischemia may cause immature brain . Direct evacuation ventricular content CSF diversion mechanism remain , sequential lumber puncture , external ventricular draining , reservoir placement . Intraventricular fibrinolytic therapy permanent shunt represent effective tool mechanically evacuate bleed product prevent accumulation CSF . However , highly invasive technique carry major risk complication . The use diuretic present non-invasive alternative , result prove inefficient . Extracellular miRNA sequence find major modulators protein cod gene involve differentiation , proliferation , apoptosis . Several study report presence significant amount miRNA extracellular fluid plasma , urine , saliva , semen . The researcher believe extracellular miRNAs present CSF sequential evaluation expression provide unique biomarker signature , time sensitive enough reflect evolution pathological event underlie development PHH . The identification miRNA biomarker PHH development and/or hemorrhagic related injury would also mean quickly evaluate treatment response .</detailed_description>
