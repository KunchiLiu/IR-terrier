	<brief_summary>In Italy , life expectancy birth reach 80 year men 85 woman ; 50 year , life expectancy age 80 increase extraordinary 61 % 55 % , respectively , due effective therapy low mortality many disease . Yet , chronic disease nowadays important , often coexist comorbidity multimorbidity , depend whether index condition consider . These condition increase risk death reduce functional autonomy elderly , therefore , carefully consider within comprehensive geriatric assessment . The epidemiology cardiovascular disease , demonstrate among others Oxford Vascular Study , show clear trend age-dependent , number event incidence increase age , half concentrate 75 year . In addition , observational study elderly patient suggest association frailty cardiovascular disease : fragility cardiovascular disease share common biological pathway , cardiovascular disease may accelerate onset frailty . The frailty syndrome identify 25 % 50 % patient cardiovascular disease , accord rating scale use population study . Frail patient cardiovascular disease , particular undergo invasive procedure suffer coronary artery disease aortic valve disease , much high adverse event complication , suggest need accurate functional stratification careful evaluation risk/benefit ratio invasive procedure . Among numerous test propose literature functional evaluation objective measure physical capability elderly patient , Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) evaluation hand grip strength ( grip strength ) characterize improved prognostic ability easy administration . The present study perform assess SPPB handgrip helpful well stratify prognosis ( all-causes death hospital admission cause ) elderly patient admit hospital cardiac cause .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective observational study . This multicenter study involve 4 Italian Cardiology Units ( Ferrara , Cento , Forlì , Ravenna ) . The study expect enroll least 400 consecutive patient ≥70 year , admit cardiovascular departement : - GROUP A : acute coronary syndrome , - GROUP B : bradycardia tachyarrhythmias require device implantation ( pace-maker , implantable cardioverter defibrillator , cardiac resynchronization therapy ) - GROUP C : acute heart failure . - GROUP D : symptomatic severe aortic stenosis receive aortic valve replacement aortic balloon valvuloplasty transcatheter aortic valve implantation . The main group study group A . The Authors enroll least 300 patient group A . The main finding study ACS patient . The result group A report Authors separate principal paper . To generate hypothesis future study , Authors enroll also group patient admit hospital cardiac cause ( group B , C D ) . These patient object separate publication . In patient , follow functional assessment perform hospital discharge : - handgrip test ( see definition ) . - Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire ( SPMSQ , see definition ) . - Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB , see definition ) . - Multidimensional Prognostic Index ( MPI , see definition ) . The aim study evaluate SPPB value able stratify prognosis elderly patient admit hospital cardiac cause . DEFINITION OF ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME . As suggested current guideline , define patient suffer ACS meet follow criterion ( first mandatory must add least one criterion 2 3 ) : 1. chest pain suggestive cardiac origin last least 20 minute . 2 . ECG change compatible sign myocardial ischemia ( ST least one mm least two contiguous lead new onset leave bundle branch block know ST-segment depression least one mm least two contiguous lead negative/ flatten T wave ) 3. detection rise cardiac biomarker value least one value 99th percentile upper reference two consecutive blood sample DEFINITION OF ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION ( ESC GUIDELINES 2012 ) The term acute myocardial infarction use case evidence myocardial necrosis clinical picture compatible acute myocardial ischemia . And particular must verify detection movement enzyme preferentially typical troponin 99th percentile limit standard presence least one follow condition : - Symptoms ischemia , - Changes de novo ST-segment T-wave , new-onset leave bundle branch block , development pathological Q wave ECG . - Evidence loss viable myocardium image detection new wall motion defect , - Identification intracoronary thrombus coronary angiography . DEFINITION OF HEART FAILURE ( ESC GUIDELINES 2012 ) It define heart failure abnormality structure cardiac function involve insufficient ability heart provide oxygen requirement relation metabolic demand tissue , despite normal increase filling pressure . Heart failure syndrome characterize presence typical symptom ( dyspnea , peripheral edema fatigue ) sign result abnormality cardiac structure function . DEFINITION AND METHODS OF ASSESSMENT TEST DELL'HANDGRIP ( HGT ) . The handgrip test measure force contraction flexor muscle finger use dynamometer . From literature know index correlate eventual malnutrition subject , capacity recovery functional recovery post-surgery , well relation age . The measurement make time admission , namely within 24 hour admission acute coronary care event patient admit diagnosis acute myocardial infarction ST-segment elevation subject coronary angiography case aortic valve disease acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation , supervision assistance medical staff . In patient , three measurement carry . Will take consideration study high value . The measurement perform indicated current guideline , patient seat , dominant hand elbow flexed 90° . They well know limitation method variability . At time method choose laborious , virtually cost-free , well-administered patient admit ACS aortic valve disease therefore readily identifiable method coarse screen elderly patient without know diagnosis `` frail elderly '' risk . All medical personnel involve study perform specific course learn proper management execution screen handgrip te personal experience proper execution . SHORT PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE BATTERY ( SPPB ) . The scale SPPB short battery test create evaluate functionality lower limb . This battery make 3 different section design assess balance 3 test : maintenance position foot together 10 second semi-tandem finally tandem 10 second . The score section varies minimum 0 patient unable maintain position foot together least 10 second maximum 4 accomplish three test . The second section test intend evaluate progress 4 linear meter depend time performance section score range 0 unable , one point performance long duration 8.7 second , 4 accomplish task le 4.80 sec . The third section investigate ability battery run 5 consecutive time , get chair without use arm regard must cross front chest . Also case , score range 0 incapable performance duration great 60 second , maximum 4 performance carry less 11.20 second . The score range 0 ( bad performance ) 12 ( best performance ) . A score 5 9 show senior still independent , reduced physical performance , therefore regard fragile high risk , deserve special attention specific intervention , act reduce risk adverse consequence . Data literature confirm SPPB correlate risk develop disability BADL mobility , proportion decrease SPPB score , regardless age , sex presence certain chronic disease . The SPPB score emerge powerful predictor disability mortality elderly population . The battery SPPB prove valid predictor prognosis heart patient : elderly hospitalize acute exacerbation chronic heart failure , SPPB score discharge able predict long-term mortality . This assessment thus appear safe feasible hospitalize patient : test perform patient hemodynamic stabilization prior discharge . MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROGNOSITC INDEX ( MPI ) The Multidimensional Prognostic Index ( MPI ) prognostic tool base standard Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment ( CGA ) predict short- long-term mortality elderly subject . The MPI include 63 item distribute 8 domain CGA follow : 1 . Activities Daily Living ( ADL ) : 6 item 2 . Instrumental Activities Daily Living ( IADL ) : 8 item 3 . Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire ( SPMSQ ) : 10 item 4 . Mini Nutritional Assessement ( MNA ) : 18 item 5 . Exton-Smith Scale ( ESS ) : 5 item 6 . Cumulative Index Rating Scale - Comorbidity Index ( CIRS-CI ) : 14 item 7 . Number drug use : 1 item 8 . Co-habitation status : 1 item On basis MPI value , possible calculate short- long-term mortality risk old subject define severity grade mortality risk : low , moderate severe . Several study show prognostic accuracy aggregate MPI significantly great prognostic accuracy individual component consider singularly . Thus multidimensional approach successfully use elderly patient clinical administrative purpose .</detailed_description>
