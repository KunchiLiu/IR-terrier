	<brief_summary>Hallux valgus define progressive subluxation first metatarsophalangeal joint lateral deviation hallux . This common foot condition associate altered gait pattern . Specifically reduced forward propulsion , lead gait instability . Research show foot problem pain play major role towards contribution fall adult population . There currently two main intervention treatment hallux valgus : surgery orthotic prescription . There lot research perform evaluate effect custom orthotic prescription hallux valgus . Therefore , study investigate adult moderate hallux valgus effect orthotic intervention efficacy forward propulsion walking . It hypothesize implementation orthotic lead decrease foot pain , increase step length , increase forward moment ankle hallux , medial center pressure track great toe instead less metatarsal . This study consist 10 adult . The participant go three round test lab . The first session consist initial baseline test participant evaluate severity Hallux Valgus range motion first metatarsophalangeal joint . A foot casting perform pedorthist participant set marker , record motion perform 15 walk trial across 10m runway force plate embed middle whilst wear standard footwear ( orthotic ) . The second lab session consist standard footwear ( orthotic ) walk well addition standard footwear custom orthotic walking . The third session , worn orthotic two week , repeat condition measure second lab session . Data center pressure trajectory , step length , foot pain , moment ankle first metatarsophalangeal joint collect calculate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The participant enter lab three time . On first session , level severity hallux valgus participant identify . The participant sit chair , bare foot rest ground . A picture foot take transverse plane . Another picture take foot individual standing position . The participant experience pain discomfort test 2 picture take foot . The participant range motion test perform first metatarsophalangeal joint . This perform researcher passively dorsiflexing first metatarsophalangeal joint measure angle create goniometer . The participant also orthotic foot casting perform pedorthist . This foot cast perform create mould foot use pedorthist construct orthotic . After participant put standard footwear ( orthotic ) set optotrak marker three first ray , three midfoot , three heel , three medial distal tibia . Then participant walk across 10m walkway force plate embed half way along walkway constant velocity total 15 trial . The participant rate pain visual analogue scale ( VAS ) immediately follow completion 15 walking trial . On second session , participant set optotrak marker perform 15 walking trial standard footwear ( orthotics ) rate pain level VAS . The custom orthotic place standard footwear . Then participant perform 15 walk trial rate pain VAS . The participant instruct wear orthotic seven hour day , seven day week two week . During two week period , principal investigator call participant , 1 week , ask orthotic wear go . In specific , often wear long . Two week later , participant return final testing session . This session consist repetition 15 walking trial vas rating standard footwear ( orthotic ) standard footwear custom orthotic . The participant debriefed offer opportunity opt summary result study complete sent . They allow keep custom orthotic .</detailed_description>
