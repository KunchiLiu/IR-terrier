	<brief_summary>The investigator interest assess value compare use automate breast ultrasound ( ABUS ) ( either primary screen approach supplementary procedure ) digital breast tomosynthesis ( DBT ) . The purpose project perform preliminary prospective study woman likely benefit use ABUS and/or DBT ( combination ) screening environment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Automated Breast Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . After appropriate training certification technologists Mammography Quality Standards Act ( MQSA ) qualification participate radiologist , investigator recruit sequentially approximately 600 woman know defined region highly dense tissue know heterogeneously dense and/or primarily dense breast tissue ( prior mammogram ) schedule undergo routine mammography screen include DBT examination . 2 . Consenting woman undergo DBT examination part routine clinical exam ABUS examination part experiment . All examination perform certified technologist performance procedure question ( DBT ABUS ) . 3 . DBT , ABUS , combination , independently review interpret ( Breast Imaging , Reporting Data System rat ) experience specifically train , MQSA qualify radiologist cross balance ( case mode reader ) study design . 4 . Using result interpretation slightly modify `` LOGICAL OR '' mode , namely high rating determines recommendation/need follow , investigator perform image base diagnostic work ups need ( i.e. , result `` arbitration step '' ) . All diagnostic follow study , need , part study protocol , exception acquire diagnostic outcome measure medical record . 5 . The investigator compare rate false positive result interpret DBT vs. ABUS vs. combination , include recall additional testing , short-interval follow-up rate biopsy rate . The sample preliminary study small assess positive predictive value ( PPVs ) , investigator focus negative predictive value ( NPVs ) . For marginal value assessment utilize modality , investigator also assess type abnormality detect modality , assume large study require assess cancer detection rate ( type etc . ) .</detailed_description>
