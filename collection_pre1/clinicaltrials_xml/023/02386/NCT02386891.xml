	<brief_summary>Based preliminary data previous study , investigator hypothesize ambient temperature experience individual influence food intake male female age 19 30 . Specifically , exposure temperature thermoneutral zone ( TNZ ) decrease consumption young adult sedentary situation . Researchers execute randomize control trial specifically test thermal exposure effect individual 's food consumption . Participants receive wear t-shirt . They thermal image take inner canthus eye middle finger nail bed , represent baseline core peripheral temperature , respectively . They randomize either colder environment ( 65°F ) warmer environment ( 75°F ) artifice monitor routine office work abnormal temperature condition . Their knowledge experiment limited end . They experience temperature filling paperwork perform basic office task . After one hour , another thermal image take . Each participant present large , Mellow Mushroom cheese pizza direct eat leisure subsequently finish office task next hour . The participant debrief parameter experiment body measurement take end prevent bias subject limit food intake . The investigator quantify energy intake weigh remain food compare know caloric content weight bomb calorimetry test . The infrared thermal image determine whether temperature experienced extreme enough initiate change thermoregulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous study suggest increased time spend outdoors associate low body mass index ( BMI ) .1,2 . In addition , energy expenditure hunger associate exposure heat cold . Increased usage central heat air condition system couple increased time spend indoors create environment human expend less energy regulate body temperature.3 The human thermoneutral zone ( TNZ ) range ambient temperature healthy adult maintain body temperature without expend energy beyond normal basal metabolic rate . Energy intake expenditure adjust temperature TNZ.4 The temperature food , smell , time consumption , number people present establish factor influence food consumption humans.5 In addition , evidence support role environment upon individual 's food intake . Wall color , light , ambient noise , influence consumption preference quantities.6 Based research animal model , particularly mouse livestock , food intake subsequently , weight gain reduced high ambient temperatures.7-10 In addition young , physically active , healthy male , food intake inversely proportional TNZ.11 However , energy expenditure increase TNZ . These study base extreme condition , therefore lack information small change ambient temperature may affect food intake general human public . Recent research show effectiveness small change time lead change consumption practices.12 Thus , alter thermal environment subtly may lead great understand long term effect weight management . The investigator previously examine thermal environment person go daily life urban rural setting ( X120217008 ) . Preliminary analysis result suggest increase % body fat associate low heat exposure .</detailed_description>
