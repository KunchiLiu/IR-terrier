	<brief_title>Study Exploring Effect DPP-4 Inhibitors β-cell Function Using Two-step Hyperglycemic Clamp</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study open-label , randomize , three-way crossover single-dose study.Subjects newly onset T2DM enrol . They assign take single dose sitagliptin ( 100 mg ) , saxagliptin ( 5 mg ) , blank control randomize order separate washout period 7-14 days.Then two-step hyperglycemic clamp initiate . On experimental day , subject take give dose Sitagliptin , Saxagliptin nothing blank control two hour clamp experiment start . The hyperglycaemic clamp perform overnight fast . Subjects place recumbent position cannula insert dorsal hand vein . The hand place heating box ( 50℃ ) throughout experiment allow frequent sample arterialized blood . A second cannula insert contralateral cubital vein glucose infusion . At time zero ( 0 min ) , 50 % glucose bolus inject 1 min increase PG 15mM . The glucose bolus calculate : ( 15mM-FPG ) ×35 mg glucose × body weight ( kg ) . PG measure bedside every 5 min maintain 15mM adjustable continuous 20 % glucose infusion . After 90min , PG lower 7mM islet cell rest , subject instruct consume 75g glucose solution orally 5min . 40min oral glucose consumption , 90min-hyperglycaemic clamp experiment wil restart . The oral period hyperglycaemic clamp process 's do fasting period . Blood sample collect -2h , 0min , 10min , 90min hyperglycaemic clamp experimental process measurement insulin , c-peptide , glucagon , active GLP-1 incretin hormone . Thus could evaluate beta cell function represent first phase second phase insulin secretion ( C-peptide secretion ) alpha cell function represent change glucagon concentration fast period oral period hyperglycaemic clamp experiment change active GLP-1 .</detailed_description>
