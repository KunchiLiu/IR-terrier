	<detailed_description>The repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) use pain treatment several year . The late meta-analysis show rTMS prove scientific efficacy . It could explain several reason : poor methodologic quality , stimulation parameter , technologic hardware , ... The aim study ass , rigorous scientific protocol , analgesic effect neuronavigated rTMS assist robotic arm chronic neuropathic painful subject . The crossover study randomize , double blind control ( sham rTMS ) include large homogeneous population suffer central neuropathic pain . The stimulated region primary motor cortex high frequency ( 20Hz ) . This study two period ( real sham ) 12 week four session stimulation per period 8 week washout two .</detailed_description>
