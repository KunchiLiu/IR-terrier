	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance ( MR ) -guided high-intensity focus ultrasound ( HIFU ) ablation increasingly use worldwide treat symptomatic uterine fibroid excellent therapeutic efficacy control symptom excellent safety record . Despite benefit , recognize MR HIFU ablation always yield good therapeutic outcome . High signal intensity T2-weighted MR image high volume transfer constant ( Ktrans ) dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR image well-known risk factor poor ablation outcome measure non-perfused volume ( NPV ) ratio ( ie , NPV divide fibroid volume ) . The aim study assess influence fibroid perfusion ( evaluate MRI contrast enhance ultrasound ) , apparent diffusion coefficient ( evaluate MR-diffusion image ) fibroid stiffness ( evaluated ARFI ) ablation efficiency uterine fibroid treatment MR-HIFU .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preprocedural predictor treatment efficacy useful exclude advance patient would benefit treatment , thereby contribute improve overall clinical outcome . During ablathermy treatment lose energy depend tissue perfusion thermic diffusion energy lay depend tissue absorption coefficient . Study parameter treatment could bring important information treatment difficulty efficacy . The investigator study compare fibroid perfusion dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance image contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS ) . CEUS perform contrast agent ( SONOVUE ) . Thermic diffusion could link fibroid stiffness . Fibroid stiffness quantify velocity shear wave measure acoustic radiation force impulse ( ARFI ) . Tissue absorption coefficient correlate architecture cellularity tissue investigator think apparent diffusion coefficient ( compute diffusion weight image ) could correlate ablathermy efficiency intra procedural thermal parameter .</detailed_description>
