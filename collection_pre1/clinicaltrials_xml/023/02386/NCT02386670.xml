	<detailed_description>By time Alzheimer 's Dementia ( AD ) relate disorder ( ADRD ) diagnose brain sustain substantial insult limit efficacy current treatment . Preventive intervention urgently need prevention study require large number participant long follow-up period unless target high-risk population . The investigator propose study efficacy preventive intervention AD three high risk group : ( 1 ) old person Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) ; ( 2 ) old person major depressive disorder ( MDD ) without MCI ; ( 3 ) old person MDD MCI . MCI consider prodromal condition dementia progression rate 1 % per month . MDD independently identify one promise target AD prevention study since , even successful treatment depressive episode , old person remit MDD develop MCI dementia rate 1-2 % per month . The investigator propose intervention combination cognitive remediation ( CR ) non-invasive brain stimulation - transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) . Participants MCI MDD ( without MCI ) randomize tDCS + CR sham ( `` palcebo '' ) tDCS + sham ( `` placebo '' ) CR . Both CR tDCS show induce neuroplasticity improve cognition . The investigator hypothesize combination enhance cognitive reserve protect cognitive decline onset MCI `` normal '' cognition AD MCI . The investigator design inform experience conduct randomize control trial ( RCTs ) old participant dementia , MCI , MDD two decade . In investigator recent donepezil prevention trial , combine donepezil standard antidepressant maintenance prevent cognitive decline incidence dementia participant MDD MCI . Building prevention trial , investigator conceptualize propose study high-risk , high-gain RCT aim enhance cognitive reserve prevent cognitive decline dementia high risk population . If investigator successful high risk population , tDCS + CR test , extend , general population ( i.e. , universal prevention ) group high risk AD ( i.e. , selective indicated prevention ) . Over 30-36 month , five Toronto academic site history successful collaboration enroll randomize : ( 1 ) 125 participant age 60 old MCI ; ( 2 ) 250 participant age 65 old successfully treat episode MDD ( defined major depressive episode occur first time late life recurs late life ) without MCI . These 375 participant randomize double-blind condition receive either tDCS + CR sham tDCS + sham CR follow 24-60 month .</detailed_description>
