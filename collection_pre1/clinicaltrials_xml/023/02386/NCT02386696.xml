	<brief_title>Pleural Sliding During Valsalva Muller Maneuvers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background aim study In normally aerate lung , detectable structure pleura , visualize hyperechoic horizontal line . The pleural line move synchronously respiration : dynamic horizontal movement call lung sliding ( 1 ) represent movement two pleural layer lung expand respiratory cycle ( 2 ) . Using B-mode , lung slide appear pleural line oscillation side side correspond variation underlie artifact . When M-mode apply lung exam , system display representation tissue motion time : case normal lung sliding , area M-mode tracing deep pleural line take granular `` sandy '' appearance relatively immobile superficial tissue appear smooth linear . This term `` Seashore Sign , '' superficial tissue resemble wave deep tissue sandy beach ( 2 , 3 ) . In point-of-care lung ultrasound , slide sign paramount importance diagnosis pneumothorax ( 1-5 ) , ultrasound find superior chest radiography supine position ( 6-8 ) . In fact , presence lung slide correspondence high point hemithorax allow rule pneumothorax sensitivity close 100 % ( 7 ) . However , absence lung slide necessarily imply rule pneumothorax ( specificity 70 % ) ( 7 ) . In fact , lung slide abolish , several possibility . ( ) The patient ventilate case accidental esophageal intubation intubation main-stem bronchus ( 9 ) . Although slide respiration visualize , pleural line see move slightly heartbeat movement heart transmit pleural line . This term `` lung pulse '' . ( b ) The patient ventilate lung slide due dense lobar consolidation . In patient underlie lung contains significant water , result predominant B-line pattern . Since B-line pattern originate lung parenchyma , lung parenchyma visualize air interposed pleura lung , presence B-lines also exclude possibility pneumothorax interspace question . ( c ) The patient ventilate lung slide difficult observe due pleural adhesion , bulla , pleurodesis . While patient may associate B-line pattern , may A-line pattern well , absence lung slide B-lines sufficient confirm presence pneumothorax . Recently , ultrasound artifact mimic lung slide describe absence visceral pleura . This observation carry group patient underwent pneumonectomy ( 10 ) . In patient , lung slide clearly absent mechanical ventilation operate hemithorax . During spontaneous breathing , although low intensity compare unoperated hemithorax , artifacts mimic lung slide seashore sign find deep spontaneous breath ( 10 ) . These finding lead hypothesis artifact may due contraction intercostal muscle . The objective present study reproduce artifacts contraction inspiratory expiratory muscle close glottis ( Valsalva Muller maneuver ) : condition subject ventilate two pleural layer slide one . Materials Methods Twenty healthy male volunteer age 18 65 years-old history respiratory cardiovascular pathology enrol . Females subject history respiratory cardiovascular disease exclude . Volunteers enrol among staff member Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit `` Agostino Gemelli '' University Hospital Rome . Each enrol volunteer train perform Valsalva 's Muller 's maneuver . Sonographic evaluation perform hemithorax sit subject follow phase last 10 second : Apnea ; Spontaneous regular breathing ; Valsalva maneuver , subject ask perform three force expiration close glottis one force inspiration ; Muller maneuver , subject ask perform three forced inspiration one force expiration ; Hyperventilation . One certified anesthesiologist , proficient lung ultrasound , perform sonographic evaluation use MyLab FiveÂ® ( Esaote , Italy ) ultrasound device . A linear ultrasound transducer place perpendicular two consecutive rib parasternal line hemithorax lung slide evaluate use B-mode M-mode abovementioned phase last 10 second . B-mode evaluation register clip M-mode one register picture . If B-lines visible , displacement respect right lateral border sonographic image evaluate Valsalva 's Muller 's maneuver spontaneous regular breathing . Afterwards , image clip register randomly name number know investigator perform sonographic exam , evaluate two anesthesiologist one radiologists proficient lung ultrasound . These three investigator assign clip image score 0 ( lung slide ) 2 ( lung slide present ) . A score 1 assigned case impossibility determine presence absence lung slide . In addition , diagnostician ask determine whether 'lung pulse ' easily distinguishable lung sliding , assign score 0 ( 'lung pulse ' indistinguishable lung slide ) 1 ( 'lung pulse ' clearly distinguishable 'lung slide ' present ) . All sonographic image clip evaluate twice order assess reproducibility assessment investigator . Data analysis Scores report mean interval , percentage five possible value . Comparisons perform use Chi square test , Fisher test , nonparametric test Kolmogorov-Smirnov test , Kruskall-Wallis test Friedman test . The following hypothesis test B-mode clip M-mode image : 1 . Apnea associate score 0 2 . Valsalva maneuver associate score 0 3 . Muller maneuver associate score 0 4 . Normal ventilation hyperventilation associate score &gt; 0 5 . Hyperventilation associate high score 6 . Scores assign condition side 7 . Scores assign investigator similar</detailed_description>
