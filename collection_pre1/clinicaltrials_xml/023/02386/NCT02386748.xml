	<brief_title>Chewing Gums Stimulate Intestinal Motility After Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction ; Cesarean section common surgery among woman associate postoperative central nervous system ( CNS ) change , lead decrease bowel movement . Postoperative ileus define transient cessation coordinate bowel motility surgical intervention . It Is one major problem post-abdominal surgery delay hospital discharge , cause abdominal pain , abdominal distension , inability start oral feeding , breastfeeding , eventually increase cost hospital care . Historically , professional gynecology obstetrics wait gut function return allow oral enter feeding , characterize symptom bowel sound , first flatus stool , feel hunger . Chewing gum stimulate stomach , enhance gastric secretion , increase peristaltic bowel movement finally hasten recovery ileus . It also recently consider researcher strategy toward ileus reduction . It seem necessity felt investigation least-expensive physiological method stimulate return bowel function . Study purpose ; To evaluate efficacy safety postoperative gum chew recovery intestinal movement cesarean section . Intervention : 450 consent woman enrol clinical trial candidate elective cesarean section divide 3 group : - Group A , 150 woman receive sugarless gum operate room discharge 2 hour least half hour two hour interval . - Group B , 150 woman receive traditional management start oral fluid operate room discharge 6 hour hear intestinal sound second day initiate full regular diet . - Group C , 150 woman control group , receive neither gum oral fluid . They intravenous fluid . All demographic data woman , indication operation , operation time , type anesthesia pathway hospital stay recover compare 3 group . Statistical Methods : Analysis data do IBM computer use SPSS ( statistical product service solution version 18 ) . Quantitative variable describe mean SD median range Qualitative variable describe number percentage . Chi-square test use compare qualitative variable group . Independent sample t-test use compare group regard quantitative variable parametric data ( SD &lt; 50 % mean ) . Comparison non-parametric group do use Mann-Whitney test . P value &lt; 0.05 significant .</detailed_description>
