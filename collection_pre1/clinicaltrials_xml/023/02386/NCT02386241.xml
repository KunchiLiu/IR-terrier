	<detailed_description>Genomic change lead formation brain tumor slowly discover . Despite advance genomic technology , much analysis hinder lack control sample could better delineate genomic alteration lead disease . The ideal genomic control would genetic material parent afflicted individual . The researcher propose compare genomic material parent sibling , diagnosis high-grade glioma . Additionally , researcher compare genomic alteration parent patient . This analysis provide unprecedented insight genomic level change take place parent patient result formation high-grade glioma .</detailed_description>
