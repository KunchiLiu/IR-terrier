	<brief_title>Intraoperative Radiotherapy After Local Recurrence Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , rate ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence ( IBTR ) breast- conserve surgery radiotherapy remain 10 % 10 year 15 % 20 year , respectively . IBTR independent predictor poor survival 3 4.6 increase risk cancer-related death . In heterogeneous population , local control remain major therapeutic challenge relapse , especially consider good prognosis , namely occur late low histological grade . Therapeutic de-escalation possible relapse avoid mutilate often traumatic mastectomy . However , second conservative surgery high rate second local relapse ( 19 50 % 5 year ) due absence re-irradiation , render impossible problem tolerance previously irradiate tissue . Retrospective prospective study partial breast irradiation ( PBI ) adjuvant set report promise result , term tolerance ( save healthy tissue ) local control ( 74 % 100 % 5 year ) . Used technique include brachytherapy , external beam radiotherapy intraoperative radiotherapy ( IORT ) . IORT subject renew interest breast cancer . It advantage high-precision ballistics operate area preservation healthy tissue . To date , prospective data , however , publish indication ipsilateral breast recurrence . A prospective , multicenter , single arm Phase II design evaluate feasibility repeat breast-conserving surgery combine re- irradiation use IORT local recurrence breast carcinoma .</detailed_description>
