	<brief_summary>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS ) complex deformity different curve . These different curve may distinguish different physiopathologic mechanism . Without fully convince model emergence development AIS , multifactorial nature seem evident . Several pathophysiological theory involve central nervous system propose : AIS would associate disturbance proprioceptive sensory perception , and/or integration information . This would result abnormal body image , responsible sensorimotor asymmetry may promote cause deformation . The Main aim study find cortical subcortical morphometric difference common population AIS ( right thoracic AIS ) compare healthy adolescent control girl . Secondary Objectives study cerebral white matter group ( fractional anisotropy main white matter tract ) , activation sensorimotor neural network ( fMRI activation functional brain connectivity ) . Abnormalities study parameter may use biomarkers AIS diagnosis classification .</brief_summary>
