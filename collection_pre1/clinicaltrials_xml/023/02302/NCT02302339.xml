	<brief_title>A Study Glembatumumab Vedotin Monotherapy Combination With Immunotherapies Patients With Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glembatumumab vedotin consist antibody attached drug , monomethyl auristatin E ( MMAE ) , kill cancer cell . The fully human antibody design deliver drug cancer cell attach protein call glycoprotein NMB ( gpNMB ) express cancer cell . The MMAE release inside cell , interfere cell growth lead cell death target cell , well neighbor cell . Varlilumab fully human antibody bind CD27 . This antibody allow body 's immune system work cancer cell . Nivolumab fully human antibody pembrolizumab humanize antibody . Both bind PD-1 . Eligible patient enroll study receive treatment one following : glembatumumab vedotin , glembatumumab vedotin varlilumab glembatumumab vedotin either nivolumab OR pembrolizumab . All patient enrol study closely monitored determine cancer respond treatment side effect may occur .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Among criterion , patient must meet following condition eligible study : Unresectable , histologicallyconfirmed advanced ( Stage III Stage IV ) melanoma Disease progression last anticancer therapy receive . For Cohort 3 , progression must occur PD1 target CPI ( checkpoint inhibitor ) treatment investigator deem appropriate continue treatment PD1 target CPI beyond confirmed disease progression No one prior chemotherapycontaining regimen advance disease . Prior treatment receive must include least one CPI inhibitor ( e.g. , AntiCTLA4 , PD1 , PDL1targeted immunotherapy ) patient BRAF mutation least one BRAF MEKtargeted therapy , unless patient candidate , refuse , therapy . For cohort 3 , prior treatment receive must include PD1 targeted CPI administer recent disease progression patient BRAF mutation least one BRAF MEKtargeted therapy appropriate The study site submit paraffinembedded tumor tissue obtain patient gpNMB analysis . Patients may require biopsy recent tumor tissue available . Patients cohort 2 3 must submit recently obtain biopsy skin fold gpNMB analysis . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 1 Adequate bone marrow , liver renal function . Among criterion , patient meet follow condition NOT eligible study : Previously receive glembatumumab vedotin ( CR011vcMMAE , CDX011 ) MMAEcontaining agent Treatment follow therapy plan start study treatment : 1 . BRAF MEK inhibitor within 2 week 2 . Monoclonal base therapy within 4 week except PD1 target checkpoint inhibitor cohort 3 3 . Immunotherapy ( tumor vaccine , cytokine , growth factor give control cancer ) within 2 week 4 . Chemotherapy within 21 day least 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) 5 . Investigational therapy within 2 week ( least 5 halflives , whichever long ) Patients ocular melanoma Neuropathy moderate ( Grade 2 ) bad .
