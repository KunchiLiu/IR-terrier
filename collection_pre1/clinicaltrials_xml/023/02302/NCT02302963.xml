	<brief_title>USS Virginia Closed-Loop Versus SAP Therapy Hypoglycemia Reduction T1D</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness control system reduce hypoglycemia comparing , randomize study , 24 hour control USS Virginia versus sensor augment pump ( SAP ) therapy subject type 1 diabetes hypoglycemia unawareness and/or risk hypoglycemia . We also evaluate effectiveness control system improve hypoglycemia counterregulation , hypoglycemia awareness , overall glycemic control . To achieve goal , conduct pre- post-intervention inpatient assessment hypoglycemia counterregulation symptom awareness . Subjects randomize USS Virginia participate two train visit monitor outpatient set step-wise deployment cell phone base Artificial Pancreas ( AP ) System home . The first training visit include training study pump AP System follow 1 week use AP System home Pump mode . The second training visit include additional training USS Virginia+AP System confirmation independent use subject follow 4 week use AP System home Closed Loop mode . Subjects randomize sensor-augmented pump therapy complete 5 week CGM home pump .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis type 1 diabetes least 1 year . For individual enrol least one criterion list must meet : Criteria document hyperglycemia ( least 1 must meet ) : 1 . Fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL ( confirm ) 2 . Twohour oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) glucose ≥200 mg/dL ( confirm ) 3 . HbA1c ≥6.5 % ( confirm ) 4 . Random glucose ≥200 mg/dL symptom 5 . No data diagnosis available participant convince history hyperglycemia consistent diabetes opinion investigator participant history consistent type 1 diabetes . Criteria require insulin diagnosis ( least 1 must meet ) : 1 . Participant required insulin diagnosis continually thereafter 2 . Participant start insulin diagnosis upon investigator review likely need insulin ( significant hyperglycemia respond oral agent ) require insulin eventually use continually 3 . Participant required insulin diagnosis continue hyperglycemic , positive islet cell antibody consistent latent autoimmune diabetes adult ( LADA ) require insulin eventually use continually thereafter Use insulin last 12 month Use insulin infusion pump last 6 month longer Age 1270 year old HbA1c &lt; 10.0 % measure DCA2000 equivalent device ; HbA1c &lt; 6.0 % total daily insulin must ≥0.5 U/kg Risk hypoglycemia hypoglycemia unawareness define follow : Clarke Hypoglycemia Perception Awareness questionnaire score ≥4 . Average Daily Risk Range ( ADRR ) &gt; 40 assessed SelfMonitoring Blood Glucose ( SMBG ) reading prior month . Subject must glucometer downloaded assessment . The subject may alternatively provide spreadsheet past 30 day blood glucose value . Low Blood Glucose Index ( LBGI ) &gt; 2.5 assessed SMBG prior month LBGI &gt; 1.1 assess 1 week CGM reading prior three week . Subject must glucometer CGM download assessment . For glucometer data , subject may alternatively provide spreadsheet past 30 day blood glucose value . Subject report recognition hypoglycemia glucose &lt; 60 mg/dL adrenergic symptom glucose 60 mg/dL ( shakiness , palpitation , diaphoresis ) . Able speak read English use basic technology cell phone . Currently use insulintocarbohydrate ratio calculate meal bolus size . Access Internet cell phone service subject 's local environment . Willingness maintain uninterrupted availability via personal cell phone time study . Willingness perform SMBG test 46 time daily ( meal , 2 hour meal bedtime , drive , exercise , indicate ) interventional phase study . Living diabetes care partner ≥18 year old meet follow inclusion criterion : Committed potentially ( randomized DiAs ) participate training activity involve DiAs component emergency procedure , Knowledgeable time participant 's location day close loop use , Committed maintaining uninterrupted availability via personal cell phone , Being present available provide assistance close loop system use night , Able speak read English use basic technology cell phone , Absence known medical condition judgment investigator might interfere completion protocol follow example : Inpatient psychiatric treatment past 6 month , Current recent abuse alcohol recreational drug history A recent injury body limb , muscular disorder , use medication , carcinogenic disease , significant medical disorder injury , medication , disease judgment investigator affect completion protocol . The presence follow exclusion study : 1 . Admission diabetic ketoacidosis 12 month prior enrollment . 2 . Severe hypoglycemia result seizure loss consciousness 3 month prior enrollment . 3 . Hematocrit less low limit normal assay . 4 . Pregnancy , breastfeeding , intention become pregnant time study procedure ; If female sexually active , must agree use form contraception prevent pregnancy participant study . A negative urine pregnancy test require premenopausal woman surgically sterile . Subjects become pregnant discontinue study . 5 . Conditions may increase risk induced hypoglycemia : know coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , history cardiac arrhythmia ( benign premature atrial contraction premature ventricular contraction allow ) , history seizure disorder , history cerebrovascular event transient ischemic attack , hypoglycemiainduced migraine within last 6 month , neurological disease . 6 . Cystic fibrosis 7 . A known medical condition judgment investigator might interfere completion protocol follow example : 8 . Inpatient psychiatric treatment past 6 month either subject subject 's diabetes care partner 9 . Presence known adrenal disorder 10 . Abnormal liver function test ( transaminase &gt; 3 time upper limit normal ) ; test require subject take medication know affect liver function diseases know affect liver function 11 . Abnormal renal function test result ( estimate Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2 ) ; test require subject diabetes duration great 5 year post onset puberty 12 . Active gastroparesis 13 . If antihypertensive , thyroid , antidepressant lipid lower medication , lack stability medication past 2 month prior enrollment study 14 . Uncontrolled thyroid disease ( TSH undetectable &gt; 10 mIU/L ) ; test require within 3 month prior admission subject goiter , positive antibody , thyroid hormone replacement , within one year otherwise 15 . Current recent abuse alcohol recreational drug patient history 16 . Infectious process anticipate resolve prior study procedure ( e.g . meningitis , pneumonia , osteomyelitis ) 17 . Any skin condition area insertion prevents safe sensor pump placement ( e.g . bad sunburn , preexist dermatitis , intertrigo , psoriasis , extensive scarring , cellulitis ) 18 . Diagnosed celiac disease currently follow gluten free diet A recent injury body limb , muscular disorder , use medication , carcinogenic disease , significant medical disorder injury , medication , disease judgment investigator affect completion protocol Current use follow drug supplement : 19 . Any medication take low blood glucose , Pramlintide , Metformin , Glucagonlike peptide1 ( GLP1 ) Analogs Liraglutide , nutraceuticals intend low blood glucose 20 . Beta blocker 21 . Oral glucocorticoid 22 . Pseudoephedrine 23 . Any medication investigator believe contraindication subject 's participation</criteria>
