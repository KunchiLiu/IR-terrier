	<brief_title>The Effect Sleeve Gastrectomy Post-prandial Serum Bile Acids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SUMMARY Bariatric surgery , sleeve gastrectomy ( SG ) , become important therapeutic option morbid obesity treatment obesity-associated co-morbidities . There evidence weight loss metabolic improvement associate SG entirely attribute restriction stomach size nutrient malabsorption . Bile acid ( BAs ) novel potential intermediary restriction-independent weight loss follow SG . Bile acid amphipathic steroid role lipid uptake metabolism gastrointestinal tract well post-prandial glucose homeostasis energy expenditure . BAs natural ligand nuclear farnesoid X receptor ( FXR ) BA activate , cell surface G-protein couple receptor , TGR5 . FXR activation inhibits lipogenesis , glycolysis , BA synthesis stimulate FGF19 production , function regulation BA synthesis . TGR5 activation increase energy expenditure stimulate enteroendocrine L cell secrete incretin hormone , glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) . Both roux-en-y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) SG , unlike gastric banding dieting , show paradoxically increase energy expenditure augment post-prandial GLP-1 secretion , suggest restriction-independent mechanism weight-loss possibly mediate change BA signal [ 1-4 ] . Although suggest animal model SG , currently unknown SG increase post-prandial BAs human increase BA signal impact weight loss co-morbidity resolution follow surgery . The identification restriction-independent mechanism weight loss SG may lead development novel surgical medical therapy exploit specific mechanism achieve significant sustainable weight loss morbidly obese patient . Further , understand mechanism weight loss SG may lead identification patient pre-operatively early post-operative period high risk poor surgical weight loss outcome . The propose work prospective study meal-induced BA physiology SG . The investigator hypothesize SG increase post-prandial serum urine BAs change post-operative bile acid profile mechanism restriction independent weight-loss follow sleeve gastrectomy . The investigator first specific aim determine effect SG post-prandial total BAs BA subtypes . The investigator work hypothesis SG increase post-prandial total BAs well modulate specific BA subtypes . Eligible SG patient undergo meal challenge preoperatively , one , three , 12 month post-operatively , measurement postprandial serum urine bile acid ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy ( UPLC/MS ) well GLP-1 FGF19 ELISA . Serum insulin , glucose , C4 level also measure assess metabolic change associate SG . The investigator second specific aim correlate change post-prandial bile acid bile acid subtypes SG post-operative excess weight loss satiety . The investigator work hypothesis post-prandial BAs BA subtypes increase follow SG , increase bile acid correspond post-operative excess weight loss , GLP-1 production , meal satiety . Post-prandial serum urine BAs preoperatively 1 , 3 , 12 month follow SG compare post-operative excess weight loss 12 month . Before meal challenge , patient ask score satiety , score correlate excess weight loss , GLP-1 total BA well BA subtypes .</detailed_description>
