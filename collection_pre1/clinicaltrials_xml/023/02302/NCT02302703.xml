	<brief_summary>Background : IBS ( irritable bowel syndrome ) describe chronic abdominal pain , may relieve defecation change stool frequency consistency . Its prevalence among child adolescent estimate 10-15 % . Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity define gastrointestinal symptom increase eat gluten-containing food improve gluten-free diet . FODMAP ( fermentable oligo- , di- , mono-saccharides polyols ) carbohydrates absorb well small intestine , therefore ferment gut microbiota , increase osmotic load intestine cause fluid shift gas production . The patient suffers bloat , abdominal pain , flatulence change stool consistency . Many food FODMAP-rich , include fruit vegetable , legume , artificial sweetener soft drink . Working hypothesis aim : To study effect Low FODMAP diet vs. Gluten free gastrointestinal symptom child IBS , assume beneficial effect base research adult . Methods : 40 child IBS , age 6-18 year , examine pediatric gastroenterology team Hadassah . All child record one week baseline diet symptom , randomly select low-FODMAP Gluten-free diet one week , together washout period one week diet . During two week intervention diet , child aid parent document score symptom ( bowel movement , abdominal pain , flatulence ) . An analysis symptom score measure anticipate influence diet baseline diet symptom . Expected result : In previous study , change symptom view within day . We expect see reduction symptom one diet , prove hypothesis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low FODMAP ( Fermentable Oligo- , di- , Mono-saccharides Polyols ) Versus Gluten-free Diet Pediatric IBS Patients ; Cross-over Randomized Trial .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outline Study Design , include Plan Study Methods : Aims : compare effect low FODMAP diet versus gluten-free diet IBS symptom child . Study design : prospective randomized , crossover trial . Study Population : aim recruit 40 child age 6-18 year answer pediatric ROME III criterion IBS . Children recruit study physician pediatric gastroenterology clinic . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Other diagnosis ( e.g . inflammatory bowel disease , celiac disease ) . 2 . Patient receive chronic medical therapy . 3 . Patient already restrictive diet ( e.g . gluten-free , lactose-free ) All patient document baseline diet - diary 7 day parents/patient specify exact content meal . They document score baseline symptom include stool consistency frequency , abdominal pain , bloat flatulence . The baseline documentation perform child , parent , accord patient 's age ability . The patient randomly select one intervention group . A clinical dietitian create interventional diet . Half patient start low FODMAP diet half start Gluten free . After 7 day , participant return 7 day washout period regular diet . After period , group switch intervention diet , additional 7 day . During two week intervention diet , patient document score symptom describe baseline documentation . -There special consideration several dietary element baseline diet , e.g . patient may regularly consume high lactose , gluten FODMAP daily diet .</detailed_description>
