	<criteria>Adults 50 year old Able sign inform consent comply study protocol duration two year . Nonexudative agerelated macular degeneration ( AMD ) one eye ( study eye ) •At time enrollment , fellow nonstudy eye must recently diagnose ( 2 year prior enrollment ) , angiographically document , previously untreated prior diagnosis , CNV lesion ( i.e. , leakage fluorescein angiography AND subretinal , intraretinal , subRPE fluid OCT ) secondary agerelated macular degeneration . Previous treatment verteporfin PDT , Macugen® , Lucentis® , intravitreal Avastin® , intravitreal Eylea® , thermal laser , external beam radiation AMD therapy study eye . History macular hole study eye . History vitrectomy study eye . Lens extraction implantation within last 3 month . Capsulotomy within last 1 month . Lens medium opacity would preclude good fundus photography angiography within next 2 year . Nevus &gt; 2 disc area within 3000 micron foveal center fluid leakage fluorescein angiography . Macular edema sign diabetic retinopathy severe 10 red dot ( microaneurysms blot hemorrhage ) . Retinal change relate high myopia myopic correction great 8.00 diopter spherical equivalent [ sphere + ½ cylinder ] . Any progressive ocular disease would affect visual acuity within next 2 year . Previous participation study investigational drug likely ocular effect within 30 day precede initial study treatment . Concurrent use systemic antiVEGF agent . Active recent ( within 4 week ) intraocular inflammation ( grade trace ) study eye . Active infectious conjunctivitis , keratitis , scleritis , endophthalmitis either eye . For subject undergone prior refractive cataract surgery study eye , preoperative refractive error study eye exceed 8 diopter myopia . Uncontrolled glaucoma study eye ( defined intraocular pressure &gt; 25 mmHg ) despite treatment antiglaucoma medication ) . Patients unable photographed document CNV due know allergy fluorescein dye , lack venous access cataract obscure CNV . Patients ocular disease compromise visual acuity study eye amblyopia anterior ischemic optic neuropathy . Current treatment active systemic infection . Evidence significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases cardiovascular disease , nervous system , pulmonary , renal , hepatic , endocrine , gastrointestinal disorder . History recurrent significant infection bacterial infection . Inability comply study followup procedure . Pregnancy ( positive pregnancy test ) lactation Premenopausal woman use adequate contraception . The following consider effective mean contraception : surgical sterilization use oral contraceptive , barrier contraception either condom diaphragm conjunction spermicidal gel , IUD , contraceptive hormone implant patch . Any condition investigator believe would pose significant hazard subject investigational therapy initiate Participation another simultaneous medical investigation trial</criteria>
