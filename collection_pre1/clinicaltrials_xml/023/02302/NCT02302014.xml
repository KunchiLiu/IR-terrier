	<detailed_description>Patients either acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) acute heart failure ( AHF ) achieve estimate risk mortality within 12 month 20 % great ( GRACE score ACS EFFECT score AHF ) assign early delay intervention use web-based randomisation system . Inclusion criterion : Age &gt; 18 year Unscheduled hospital admission due congestive heart failure acute coronary syndrome 12 month estimate mortality risk 20 % great Optimal tolerate medical device therapy Exclusion criterion : Expected survival &lt; 28 day Other life limit non-cardiac condition likely cause death within 12 month Moderate severe dementia Moderate severe cognitive impairment Supportive &amp; Palliative Care Planning Intervention The plan intervention follow core principle holistic palliative care . The detailed content may adapt follow baseline qualitative interview focus group study outline may evolve pilot phase ( see ) . The first component intervention consist interview patient carer within 7 day enrolment This undertaken trial consultant cardiologist trial nurse quiet room either hospital patient home . This baseline consultation explore clinical social need patient carer , previous current clinical status treatment , goal treatment care event future clinical deterioration , cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) status . The aim develop patient-centred Future Care Plan ( FCP ) . This interview also establish whether patient carer happy share FCP community-based care team out-of-hours emergency care service . Two scheduled patient/carer consultation nurse specialist take place 6 12 week follow enrolment explore issue around cardiac care , physical , social , psychological , spiritual , cultural information need . At meeting FCP review detail change make new document share organisation outline patient 's permission . The second component intervention continuous supportive care deliver trial nurse specialist act professional carer advocate patient 12 week intervention phase . Specifically , nurse available mobile phone Monday Friday , 0900 1700 patient carer call advice support . This trial nurse ensure patient place primary care palliative care register . They also provide opportunity patient family ask information condition care , current FCP available primary care , out-of-hours service hospital patient information system update less 6 weekly interval . The nurse review detail FCP patient follow-up interview focus change patient 's symptom , treatment goal , cardiopulmonary resuscitation status preference place care deteriorate . The trial nurse work closely palliative care team , trial cardiologist patient 's general practitioner . In order document success interface process , nurse document number , duration content communication healthcare professional arise study . The trial nurse specialist use establish tool monitor document patient carer need visit use Needs Assessment Tool Palliative Care . The patient 's secondary primary care team inform patient 's involvement trial . Since patient may choose take-up service define within intervention carefully document utilisation interventional service offer . Use primary care service carefully monitor study period . All clinical data include comorbidities document time enrolment study . Summary intervention : patient randomise hospital either early intervention 12 week delay intervention start 12 week discharge , last 12 week . INTERVENTION Baseline interview trial cardiologist trial nurse last 1 hour Creation Future Care Plan ( FCP ) document follow baseline interview Sharing FCP document primary care unscheduled care organisation 6 week interview trial nurse last 1 hour review FCP 12 week interview trial nurse last 1 hour review FCP Continuous access trial nurse mobile telephone 9am - 5pm Monday-Friday 12 week Trial nurse - ensure FCP appropriately share primary secondary care , patient register primary care palliative care register liaise specialist PC service general practitioner need . During first 12 week study , patient randomise usual care specifically receive service . Recent audit centre suggest delivery service Heart Failure patient inconsistent generally poor delivery service people coronary heart disease non-existent . Outcome-measures Phase 2 trial Since study power assess clinical outcome , plan explore number outcome could use later phase 3 trial . The following outcome explore : 1 . Patient carer-centred outcome : Outcomes assess use follow questionnaire tool patient informer carers : ESAS - Edmonton symptom assessment scale , EQ5D - European Quality Health Status , KDS - Kessler Distress Scale , Zarit 6 - caregiver burden questionnaire All patient complete series questionnaire , address symptom ( Edmonton symptom assessment scale ) , quality life ( EQ5D ) distress ( Kessler Distress scale ) [ 20 ] immediately prior discharge 6 , 12 , 18 24 week ( see figure ) ideally within 7 day contact trial professional . Since intervention may impact carers also plan assess quality life ( EQ5D ) , distress ( Kessler ) caregiver burden ( Zarit 6 ) [ 21 ] use validated questionnaire similar time point . Questionnaires mail patient carer approximately 2 day trial time point respondent encourage complete within 3 day . The RA offer telephone support assist completion questionnaires case ensure consistency response [ 22 ] . The RA responsible mailing , collection collation outcome measure phase 2 trial blind randomisation status patient . 2 . System outcomes All-cause unscheduled hospitalisation ( include number day hospital ) , cardiovascular unscheduled hospitalisation , hospice admission use specialist palliative care service , achievement primary care palliative care Quality Outcomes Framework criterion ( placed PC register , care plan place hour handover document ) 6 , 12 24 week enrolment , whether secondary primary care case record contain documentation care plan discussion formal record CPR status 6 , 12 , 18 24 week enrolment . All patient follow 12 month enrolment hospitalisation outcome . 3 . After -death outcome measure These ill include assessment time death study enrolment , cause death , preferred place care , actual place death , Carer experience ( VOICES questionnaire [ 22 ] ) . All patient follow 12 month follow enrolment mortality . Data analysis statistical issue Descriptive statistic ( continuous variable : mean , standard deviation , median , range ; categorical variable : number percentage participant ) present clinical demographic feature patient screen finally enrol study . One main outcome study assess carefully quality life . The mean difference EQ-5D health-related quality life ( QoL ) utility early delay intervention group firstly analyse 12 week time point use analysis covariance , adjust baseline utility score . We explore difference QoL group 24 week ( t5 ) method . The multiple measure baseline , mid-point end intervention allow analysis trend intervention effect QoL parameter address distress symptom assessment tool use repeated measure analysis variance . The distribution variability EQ-5D value cohort patient identify poor prognosis use inform design sample size future phase 3 trial . An economic evaluation phase 3 trial consider , use discrete choice experiment , patient preference , value willingness pay end life care component value quality life . This approach complement patient-centred nature intervention . Information guide design economic evaluation gather use feedback qualitative component study .</detailed_description>
