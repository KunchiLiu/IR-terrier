	<brief_summary>Research show pleth variability use assess asthma severity child status asthmaticus . The investigator would like use FDA-cleared monitor ( Masimo Radical 7 ) measure Pleth Variability Index ( PVI ) see degree PVI use help triage patient present pediatric ED status asthmaticus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pleth Variability Asthma Severity Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients asthma obstruction exhalation result hyperinflation lung . This hyperinflation result phenomenon know pulsus paradoxus physiologic drop blood pressure normally see inhalation exaggerate . Studies show patient severe asthma exacerbation ( i.e . hyperinflation ) great degree pulsus paradoxus . Typically , pulsus paradoxus measure use sphygmomanometer , however , researcher demonstrate also accurately measure use plethysmography , term know pleth variability index ( PVI ) . Using concept , Arnold et al ( 2008 , 2010 ) show great degree pulsus paradoxus correlate asthma severity . The investigator ' study aim simplify association PVI asthma severity . The investigator hypothesize follow : 1 . Patients high admission PVI high likelihood admit hospital . 2 . Patients admit Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) high PVI patient admit floor . 3 . PVI accurately use gauge response bronchodilator/anti-inflammatory therapy . 4 . PVI effective respiratory severity score predict asthma severity gauge response bronchodilator therapy . To investigator recruit child present pediatric ED status asthmaticus . They connect Masimo Radical 7 monitor upon admission ED 4 hour later . In addition investigator calculate respiratory severity score time interval . The investigator look disposition patient upon leave ED : discharge home , admission inpatient floor admission ICU .</detailed_description>
