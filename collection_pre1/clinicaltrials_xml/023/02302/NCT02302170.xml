	<detailed_description>Helicobacter pylorus ( H. pylori ) Gram-negative , microaerophilic bacterium persistently colonize human stomach ; half human population infect worldwide . H. pylorus infection major risk factor development gastritis , peptic ulcer , gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma , gastric cancer . At present , main clinical treatment H. pylori infection application antibiotic bismuth agent H+ antagonist . Due widespread drug resistance , toxic side effect , high medical cost well poor patient compliance , unworkable practice antibiotic therapy H. pylorus eradication every patient . Vaccination effective way prevention H. pylorus infection . Since H. pylorus find , great attention give H. pylorus vaccine , scientist worldwide make great effort develop prophylactic therapeutic H. pylorus vaccine . Numerous H. pylorus vaccine approach study , include inactivated whole cell H. pylorus vaccine , genetic engineering subunit vaccine , live vector vaccine . Urease consider excellent candidate antigen vaccine H. pylorus . However , vaccine H. pylorus use clinic . The phaseⅠand Ⅱclinical trial oral recombinant Helicobacter pylorus vaccine complete Jiangsu Province China . The data phaseⅠand Ⅱclinical trial suggest oral recombinant Helicobacter pylorus vaccine clinically acceptable safety good immunogenicity child . To explore safety immunogenicity profile vaccine , phase Ⅲ clinical trial conduct .</detailed_description>
