It take 10 minute complete . You complete questionnaire 1 time every week start study drug . The study staff tell complete questionnaire . - If become pregnant , urine may collect pregnancy test . On Day 1 Weeks 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , every 4 week Week 24 ( Weeks 13 , 17 , 21 , 24 ) every 8 week : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . This routine blood draw may include pregnancy test become pregnant . - If become pregnant , urine may collect pregnancy test . Every 4 week Week 24 every 8 week , EKG . Every 8 week : - You MRI , CT , PET scan check status disease . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw biomarker testing . - If doctor think need , may bone scan and/or fluorodeoxyglucose-PET ( FDG-PET ) scan check status disease . Starting Week 24 , call research nurse every 8 week ( 4-week midpoint every 8-week study visit ) ask symptom may start new medication . This call last 15 minute . During study , leftover tissue previous biopsy surgery collect biomarker testing . If study doctor think need , photograph take skin lesion rash may develop study . Your private area cover ( much possible ) , picture face take unless lesion face . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . If disease appear get bad , study doctor monitor safety study think still receive benefit study drug , may able continue receive drug . This discussed . Your participation study follow-up visit . Follow-Up Visit : About 30-37 day last dose study drug , follow-up visit . At visit : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You EKG . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . If side effect follow-up visit , may additional follow-up visit side effect get good doctor think long need . This investigational study . Cabozantinib FDA-approved commercially available treatment metastatic medullary thyroid cancer . It investigational give cabozantinib patient pheochromocytoma paraganglioma . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 22 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
