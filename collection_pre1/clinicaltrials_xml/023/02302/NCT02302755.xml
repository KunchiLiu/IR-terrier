	<detailed_description>Overview Study Design : This study pilot Phase I , open-label , non-randomized , single-arm , clinical trial TP10 5 patient C3G , age 4 year old . The study consist 4-week screen period follow 26-week treatment period . ( See Schedule Events , Table 1 . ) The 26-week treatment period divide Induction Period 4 week , follow Maintenance Period , allow continue treatment total 26 week . Screening Period : Patients identify possible enrollment study number mechanism , include physician patient-self referral participation on-going study C3G renal pathology review confirm diagnosis C3G genetic complement study perform . Patients appear meet eligibility criterion study upon initial review ask contact Drs . Nester Smith interested study . Those patient express interest study schedule screen clinic visit time meet study team review study design requirement . A consent study participation obtain . During visit events/tests note Table 1 , Screening Visit , complete . If already vaccinate within time period active coverage specify vaccine manufacturer , patient administer meningococcal , pneumococcal haemophilus influenzae vaccine prior study drug administration . Treatment Period : All patient enrol University Iowa . This study follow patient-specific dose-escalation scheme Induction Period subsequent dose adjustment base complement level Maintenance Period ( describe Investigational Product Dosing Administration ) . Safety Monitoring : Safety data trial review Data Monitoring Safety Person ( DMSP ) consist one reviewer otherwise independent trial conduct , well study investigator . The DMSP review safety data periodic basis base accrual rate emergence safety data . The DMSP evaluate patient data purpose identify safety concern may require modification current study protocol also responsible determine criterion halt trial meet ( see ) . Study Stopping Rules : If follow criterion meet , enrollment trial halt data review DMSP . The trial reopen mutually agree plan define DMSP . - Futility first three patient . Futility define : - Failure Induction Period normalize C3 , C3 breakdown product alternative pathway complement activity - Any following toxicity one patient : - Dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , define Grade 3 high drug-related adverse event ( AE ) - Grade 3 high infection cause encapsulated bacteria , responsive appropriate medical intervention within 24 hour - Drug-related death Investigational Product Dosing Administration Each TP10 administration consist 60 ( ±5 ) -minute intravenous drip infusion use 0.22 µm in-line filter controlled-rate infusion pump . Administered dos range 5 mg/kg 30 mg/kg , determine patient-specific dose-escalation adjustment . Any change weight 10 % require re-calculation administer dose ; otherwise , dose may base baseline weight . All dose bi-weekly induction weekly maintenance . To determine effect TP10 complement C3 convertase inhibition , complement study include measure TP10 serum concentration serum level C3 C3 breakdown product assay alternative pathway function . Testing do serum plasma sample obtain prior approximately 15 minute post TP10 dose . All complement study perform University Iowa . The following treatment plan follow patient . However , give limited experience TP10 treatment C3G , well breadth complement study may use assess impact treatment , acknowledge treatment plan within pilot study may account potential clinical scenario . Therefore , adjustment dose level frequency fall outside plan may implement determine clinically appropriate lead investigator University Iowa . In case , IRB notify plan dose change . Induction Period During Induction Period , sample complement study analyze least weekly . The first two dos Induction Period 5 mg/kg . Intra-patient dose-escalation subsequently occur weekly , 5 10 mg/kg increment ( determined investigator , base complement biomarker change ) , maximum dose 30 mg/kg . The Induction Period schedule modify either follow criterion meet : - Dose escalation discontinue normalization C3 , C3 breakdown product AND/OR measure ( ) alternative and/or terminal pathway complement activity achieve . Thereafter , patient receive one additional TP10 dose dose level prior dose , transition Maintenance Period . - If dose level 30 mg/kg reach without normalization C3 , C3 breakdown product AND/OR measure ( ) alternative and/or terminal pathway complement activity , patient may receive one additional dose TP10 30 mg/kg . - If normalization C3 , C3 breakdown product AND/OR measure ( ) alternative and/or terminal pathway complement activity fail occur , treatment discontinue . - If normalization C3 , C3 breakdown product AND/OR measure ( ) alternative and/or terminal pathway complement activity occur , patient enter Maintenance Period follow rule Maintenance Period dose adjustment . In addition , study drug dose discontinue additional criterion discontinuation study therapy ( see ) met . Maintenance Period Since quite possible dose require maintenance may significantly lower require induction , Maintenance Period seek identify low dose provide ongoing control undesirable complement activity . The start dose TP10 Maintenance dose level last dose Induction Period ; however , Maintenance Period allow dose decrease 2 mg/kg , low start dose Induction Period . Samples complement study collect dose day analyze least weekly University Iowa Maintenance Period . Therefore , treatment decision make least weekly , dose adjustment throughout Maintenance period implement follow ( see Section 8.3.2 detail ) : - If C3 , C3 breakdown product AND/OR measure ( ) alternative and/or terminal pathway complement activity normalize two consecutive week , next Maintenance dose may decrease 5 mg/kg ( previous dose 5 mg/kg , dose decrease 2 mg/kg ) . Note : The dose level MAY maintain deem appropriate treating investigator , consideration factor biomarker evidence neo-C3 convertase generation overall profile lab utilized define maintenance . - If C3 level drop &gt; 25 % compare entry Maintenance Period , C3 breakdown product present ( great normal ) , AND/OR measure ( ) alternative terminal pathway complement activity significantly change ( &gt; 50 % worsen value ) , next Maintenance dose increase 5 mg/kg maximum 30 mg/kg ( previous dose 2 mg/kg , dose increase 5 mg/kg ) . - If patient experience dose reduction subsequent dose escalation twice , dose reduction may require , implement investigator 's discretion . Otherwise , patient may maintain last dose provide normalization C3 , C3 breakdown product AND/OR alternative and/or terminal pathway complement activity unless change require dose increase , describe . - If normalization C3 , C3 breakdown product AND/OR alternative and/or terminal pathway complement activity fail occur despite receipt 30 mg/kg twice weekly dose two week , patient withdrawn study . The Maintenance Period continue either : - The total study treatment period 26 week elapse ; - Any additional criterion discontinuation study therapy ( see ) met . Additional criterion treatment discontinuation At point study , treatment discontinue follow reason : - Decrease renal function , define increase serum creatinine 50 % baseline ( last assessment prior first TP10 dose ) , persistent 4 week . - Development dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , define Grade 3 high AE attribute TP10 dosing , Grade 3 infection cause encapsulated bacteria , responsive appropriate medical intervention within 24 hour . Patients experience DLT consider treat investigator potentially appropriate TP10 treatment may retreat consultation , agreement , DMSP . - The study terminate ( see early stopping rule ) . - Request patient patient 's legal representative . - If , investigator 's medical judgment , participation would injurious patient 's health wellbeing . - Non-compliance patient . - Pregnancy . - Patient lose follow-up . Criteria Evaluation Safety Evaluations : Safety assess vital sign measurement , clinical laboratory test , ECG ( patient ≥ 35 year age ) routine physical examination , include physical growth child 18 year old incidence severity adverse event ( grade accord CTCAE v 4.0 ) . Activity Evaluations : Activity TP10 C3G assess via complement study ( include limit serum C3 , serum C3 breakdown product , alternate pathway activity ) , chronic kidney disease stage , renal biopsy ( C3 deposition glomerular basement membrane ) , renal function ( proteinuria , serum creatinine ) . Pharmacokinetic Evaluations : Serum concentration TP10 measure concurrently serum C3 , C3 breakdown product , alternative pathway complement activity sample take immediately approximately 15 minute TP10 infusion . No pharmacokinetic parameter determine study . Immunological Evaluations : Patients monitor development antibody TP10 . Pharmacodynamic Evaluations : Pharmacodynamics TP10 assay change serum C3 , serum C3 breakdown product alternative pathway complement activity . Pharmacogenomic Evaluations : Patients undergo genetic testing CFH , C3 , CFB CFHR5 ; assay C3Nef activity ; screen factor H autoantibody ( FHAA ) factor B autoantibody ( FBAA ) .</detailed_description>
