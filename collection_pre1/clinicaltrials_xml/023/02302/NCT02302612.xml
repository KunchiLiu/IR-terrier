	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death U.S . Despite availability evidence-based guideline efficacious therapy , however , many patient achieve full benefit CVD risk reduction . In particular , complex patient ( defined patient respond current disease management approach ) multiple concurrent chronic condition represent key segment population would benefit new approach care . In response PA-12-024 : Behavioral Interventions Address Multiple Chronic Conditions Primary Care , seek `` practical interventions…to modify behavior use common approach '' among patient multiple co-morbidities , investigator test integrated behavioral intervention design improve core set chronic disease self-management skill overcome common barrier care engagement encounter increasingly important segment U.S. adult primary care population . This randomized trial conduct within Kaiser Permanente Northern California ( KPNC ) , integrate care delivery system serve 3.2 million member , include patient insured Medicare state Medicaid program . The investigator evaluate intervention 3 KPNC primary care practice enrol 576 complex patient persistently ( ≥ 2 year ) uncontrolled CVD risk factor ( e.g . hypertension , hyperlipidemia , diabetes ) despite enrol CVD disease management program . This behavioral intervention design activate engage patient , identify potentially hidden barrier care alcohol misuse sub-clinical depression , develop individualize care plan design catalyze effective primary care management . Randomization patient-level . The investigator examine impact intervention clinical outcome ( control systolic blood pressure , HbA1c ( diabetes ) , statin treatment rate ) 12 month patient-reported outcome ( patient activation , medication adherence , mental health status ) 6 month . By focus core health skill care barrier , patient-focused intervention seek enable complex patient become effective agent care thereby achieve similar clinical benefit less complex patient .</detailed_description>
