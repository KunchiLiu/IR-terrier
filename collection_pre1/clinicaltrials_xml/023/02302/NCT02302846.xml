	<brief_title>Study MLN9708 Maintenance Therapy Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . If find eligible take part study , take ixazomib capsule Days 1 , 8 15 cycle . Ixazomib capsule swallow whole , water , empty stomach ( take dose least 1 hour 2 hour meal ) . If miss dose , take soon remember , long next schedule dose 3 day away . If vomit take dose , make dose continue next schedule dose plan . You may receive study drug 12 cycle . If doctor think best interest , may able continue take study drug beyond Cycle 12 . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle ( +/- 1 day ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Days 8 15 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Every third cycle , bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check status disease . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : After last dose study drug , return clinic end-of-study visit . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy check status disease . This investigational study . Ixazomib FDA-approved commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 40 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
