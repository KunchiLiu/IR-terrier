	<brief_summary>Over 200 million child age 5 year low middle-income country reach developmental potential , largely due lack adequate nutrient lack psychosocial stimulation . Stunting ( length-for-age &lt; -2 z-scores ) indication chronic undernutrition . Guatemala high rate stunt Western Hemisphere ( 40 % ) .

	<detailed_description>The plan implement cluster randomized placebo control trial infant phase ( 6-12 month age ) preschool phase ( 36-48 month age ) . For infant phase , investigator use ProPAN ( Process Promotion Child Feeding ) development evaluation intervention , modification necessary Guatemalan context . ProPAN tool develop distribute Pan American Health Organization develop , implement , evaluate intervention program improve infant young child diet feeding . ProPAN include four module : Module 1 : Assessment Module 2 : Testing Recipes Recommendations Module 3 : Intervention Module 4 : Monitoring Evaluation For preschool phase , investigator use evidence-based school readiness intervention ( Little By Little ) show effective Hispanic preschooler . The intervention implement Association Prevention Study HIV/AIDS train supervise community health worker . By work directly local non-profit organization , project well position inform strategy scale intervention community wide basis , beneficial effect show . The project examine effect integrate intervention include micronutrient powder add food responsive feeding infant school readiness preschooler . The primary aim examine integrate micronutrient + responsive feeding/school readiness intervention change development ( primary outcome ) , growth micronutrient status ( secondary outcome ) young child . The investigator focus infant ( 6-12 month ) risk micronutrient deficiency high , transition breast feed complementary feed family diet . The investigator focus preschooler ( 36-48 month ) examine micronutrient + school readiness intervention improve child 's school readiness skill . The design include neighborhood cluster randomize four group : 1 ) micronutrient plus responsive feeding/school readiness 2 ) micronutrient , 3 ) placebo plus responsive feeding/school readiness , 4 ) placebo . The investigator test follow hypothesis : 1 . Children two micronutrient group well change baseline development ( primary outcome ) , growth micronutrient status ( secondary oitcomes ) , child two placebo group . 2 . Mothers child two responsive feeding/school readiness group well change baseline measure child development two control group . 3 . The impact responsive feeding/school readiness intervention great micronutrient group placebo group . Children micronutrient plus responsive feeding/school readiness group well change baseline development child three group .</detailed_description>
