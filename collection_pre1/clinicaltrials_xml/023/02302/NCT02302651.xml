	<brief_summary>Non-invasive treatment Osteoid osteoma use MRI guide high-intensity focus ultrasound . This study design intention-to-treat use totally non-invasive approach pain reduction , quality life improvement long-term bone restoration . Procedure perform single session use limited amount acoustic energy target osteoid nidus . Treatment perform anesthesia ( peripheral general accord age lesion position ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An osteoid osteoma benign , painful musculoskeletal tumor usually occur young male . The standard care United States compute tomography ( CT ) -guided radiofrequency ablation , minimally invasive percutaneous procedure , clinical success rate range 85 % 98 % . Percutaneous surgical therapy lead non-negligible side-effects limited efficacy pediatric population young adult osteoid osteoma . We investigate whether selective focal ablation osteoid lesion reduce treatment burden without compromise long-term clinical efficacy . Treatments perform use 3.0-T MR unit ( Discovery MR 750 ; GE Medical Systems , Milwaukee , Wis ) feature Conformité Européenne-approved ExAblate MR-guided focus ultrasound system ( InSightec , Tirat-Carmel , Israel ) ultrasound transducer house patient table . Alignment lesion transducer obtain patient use moistened gel pad degas water acoustic coupling . This approach avoid air- skin interface , cause energy reflection skin burn . After patient positioning , lesion localize MR treatment use variably orientate non enhanced T1- T2-weighted acquisition . In general , ideal 90° incidental angle plan focus ultrasound path lesion , relative bone long axis , obtain least approximated . The short skin-lesion distance select beam pathway . Care take avoid multiple interface ( skin , muscle , fascia ) much possible minimize deflection focus ultrasound beam . Each lesion manually segment operator precisely delineate nidus , skin surface , cortical surface bone . Sensitive area surround target volume also draw limit energy prevent unwanted thermal damage . The treatment plan calculate automatically ExAblate software accord previously acquire parameter , include energy ( joule ) , interval two sonications , sonication duration , spot size , modifiable operator . Thereafter , low-energy sonication test perform confirm path correct direction ultrasound beam target area confirm plan energy dose effective dose deploy lesion . The increase tissue temperature evaluate use real-time MR thermometry phase-difference fast spoil gradient-echo sequence ( proton resonant frequency shift method ) . The sequence acquire provide temperature-dependent image real-time mapping thermal dose prefer imaging plane . The proton resonant frequency shift method start simultaneously sonication . Similar treatment bone lesion use MR-guided focused ultrasound , temperature increase determine adjacent periskeletal tissue . In fact , proton resonant frequency sequence effectively measure temperature bone surface absence move proton cortical zone . Thus , MR thermometry reveals temperature increase , propagate conductive process bone immediately adjacent soft tissue respond linearly increase bone temperature , thereby allow accurate measure heating . Portions periosteum adjacent tumor fully ablate re-treated deemed necessary . The critical temperature threshold ablation set 65°C soft tissue adjacent target bone structure . Postprocedural care include evaluation possible skin burn , monitor vital sign 2 hour treatment MR department , administration analgesic and/or antiemetic drug request . Treatment-related adverse event record minor major basis medical severity , additional treatment , long-term consequence patient . Treatment perform outpatient basis patient receive local peripheral anesthesia ; patient receive general anesthesia usually hospitalize 24 hour treatment .</detailed_description>
