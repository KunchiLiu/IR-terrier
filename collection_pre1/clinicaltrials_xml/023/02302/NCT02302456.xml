	<brief_title>Tranexamic Acid Preventing Postpartum Haemorrhage Following Vaginal Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) major cause maternal mortality , account one quarter maternal death worldwide . Its incidence estimate literature vary widely , 3 % 15 % delivery . Uterotonics birth intervention show effective PPH prevention . Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) , antifibrinolytic agent , therefore investigate potentially useful complement uterotonics prevention prove reduce blood loss elective surgery , bleed trauma patient , menstrual blood loss . Randomized controlled trial PPH prevention cesarean ( n=10 ) vaginal ( n=2 ) delivery show woman receive TXA significantly less amount postpartum blood loss without increase severe maternal adverse effect . However , overall , quality trial poor , design test effect TXA reduction PPH incidence , incidence rare severe adverse effect . Large , adequately powered multicenter randomize controlled trial require widespread use TXA prevent PPH recommend . The investigator propose multicentre randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , two parallel group . Individual information trial provide woman late pregnancy prenatal visit . This information repeat woman arrive delivery room ; woman confirm participation provide inform write consent delivery , , opinion investigator , woman likely vaginal delivery minimum 4 cm cervix dilatation . The intervention intravenous administration 10-ml blind ampoule study drug ( either 1g TXA placebo accord randomisation order ) , slowly ( 30-60 second ) , within 2 minute birth prophylactic oxytocin administration , cord clamp . All aspect management third stage identical arm : - Routine prophylactic intravenous injection 5 IU oxytocin delivery anterior shoulder within 2 minute birth - Placement graduate ( 100 mL graduation ) collector bag birth , leave place birth attendant judge bleed stop , always least 15 minute . When woman include trial , bag prepare ready put place soon baby bear place mother 's belly ; need , second staff person present help manage baby bag . This make possible collect measure vaginal blood loss objectively immediate postpartum . - Manual removal placenta 30 minute birth expel absence bleeding . - Rapid suture episiotomy , accordance good clinical practice - Systematic use uterotonic drug third stage labor recommend . - Controlled cord traction ( CCT ) leave discretion practitioner . If PPH occur , standardise management provide accord department 's protocol . In particular , use TXA treatment PPH allow leave discretion practitioner accord department 's protocol . The duration participation patient include trial inclusion 3 month postpartum . The planned total duration trial 34 month include 23 month patient inclusion</detailed_description>
