	<brief_summary>Spinal anesthesia common technique provide anesthesia knee joint replacement surgery . The investigator wish demonstrate use low approach spinal anesthetic ( Taylor 's approach L5-S1 ) cause less low blood pressure still provide adequate anesthesia knee joint replacement surgery high approach ( L3-L4 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Taylor 's Approach v Lumbar Approach Spinal Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose To determine Taylor 's approach ( paramedian , via L5-S1 interspace ) subarachnoid blockade produce less hypotension commonly use paramedian lumbar approach ( via L3-L4 interspace ) . 2 . Hypothesis Taylor 's approach subarachnoid blockade total knee joint arthroplasty result less hypotension require treatment paramedian lumbar approach . 3 . Justification Taylor describe method obtain spinal anesthesia urological procedure use paramedian approach L5-S1 . This interspace large tend less affected degenerative change lumbar interspaces . Because attribute approach use alternative either midline paramedian approach lumbar vertebrae interspaces . Hypotension frequent important complication spinal anesthesia . As degree hypotension correlate height blockade achieve , perform dural puncture low interspace may result less hypotension . Several previous study compare degree hypotension result subarachnoid block perform via different lumbar interspaces conflict result . However direct comparison lower Taylor 's approach lumbar approach investigate previously . Studies past use surface anatomy determine level lumbar interspaces , since show inaccurate . A study compare identification lumbar interspaces palpation ultrasound show palpation correct 30 % time , correct identification able achieve ultrasound 71 % time . Similar rate correct identification ultrasound show subsequent study . Using ultrasound study identify relevant Lumbosacral anatomy enable u make direct comparison two approach subarachnoid blockade rate subsequent hypotension well ease procedure side effect . 4 . Objectives ) Primary : To compare degree hypotension require treatment Taylor 's approach ( L5-S1 ) paramedian lumbar approach ( L3-L4 ) spinal anesthesia total knee joint arthroplasty . Secondary : For approach compare : The ease technique assess : - The number needle insertion attempt number needle pass ( insertion redirection attempt ) require establish dural puncture . - Procedure time include time take establish landmarks ultrasound . Patient acceptability - Patient rat pain score immediately procedure ( 0 - 10 ) - Patient rat satisfaction immediately procedure ( 1 - 5 ) Success central neuraxial blockade - The maximum block height achieve - Time completion administration spinal block height L1 dermatome - Time completion administration spinal regression block height L3 dermatome - Amount additional analgesia require procedure 5 . Research method To fulfill objective investigator plan perform randomized trial compare two approach spinal anaesthesia patient undergo primary total knee joint arthroplasty . 1 . Recruitment Eligible patient present primary knee arthroplasty surgery University British Columbia Hospital identify anesthesiologist anesthesia pre-assessment clinic day surgery . At stage inform study give information leaflet read . On day surgery member research team approach eligible patient inform patient option participate study , treatment group entail answer question patient may . If patient interested participate study ask sign consent form inform may withdraw study time without consequence . There monetary material compensation participant . Inclusion criterion male female volunteer age 19 able understand study protocol give inform consent . They need present elective primary total knee joint arthroplasty spinal anesthesia American Society Anesthesiology ( ASA ) class 1 , 2 3 . Exclusion criterion patient ASA 4 5 , unable understand study protocol give inform consent . Patients elect deem clinically inappropriate spinal anesthesia exclude well patient present revision knee joint arthroplasty . 2 . Randomization Prior procedure , participate patient , seal unmarked opaque envelope contain one two treatment group open . Patients receive spinal anaesthetic either via paramedian lumbar approach Taylor 's approach . 3 . Intervention For treatment group patient usual preparation spinal anesthesia , involve intravenous line intravenous fluid run , standard monitoring , appropriately position operate table . The patient receive premedication 0.02 - 0.05mg/kg midazolam . The blood pressure obtain anesthesia pre-assessment clinic preoperative area take patient baseline blood pressure . An experienced anesthesiologist perform ultrasound scan patient low-frequency ( 2 - 5 MHz ) curved-array probe , identify relevant anatomy , prior perform spinal anesthetic . Taylor 's approach : Patients randomise Taylor 's approach group first sacrum identify ultrasound probe transverse position patient ' midline . The transducer rotate 90 degree paramedian axis L5 - S1 interspace identify . The position transducer adjust obtain best image interspace centre ultrasound screen . A marking pen use mark midpoint probe 's long short edge . The point mark would intersect use initial needle insertion point spinal anesthesia . The lumbosacral area prepare sterile manner appropriate sterile technique spinal anaesthesia perform 25-gauge , 90 mm , pencil-point needle insert 20-gauge introducer needle . Once dural puncture achieve cerebral spinal fluid obtain hub spinal needle 12.5 mg 0.5 % bupivacaine ( preservative free ) inject . Paramedian lumbar approach : Patients randomise Paramedian lumbar approach group scan similar manner Taylor 's approach group . The sacrum identify first , transducer paramedian axis interspaces identify count L5 - S1 L3 - L4 . At L3 - L4 interspace image optimise skin mark described . Spinal anesthesia proceed identical manner dose bupivacaine . After spinal anaesthesia perform group patient remain sit position 5 minute position supine surgery . The patient blood pressure heart rate measure 5 minute interval ( regularly discretion anesthesiologist ) . If decrease mean arterial blood pressure occur , great 20 % patient ' pre-recorded baseline , decrease heart rate le 50 bpm 5 10mg increment ephedrine administer . Sensory block assess bilateral application ice 5 minute interval . Intravenous fentanyl 25 - 50 mcg increment administer patient complains pain surgery . 4 . Data Collection The patient 's age , height weight record , also significant past medical problem , particular patient history hypertension . Baseline observation include blood pressure take anesthetic assessment clinic visit prior day surgery . An independent observer record time take establish landmark ultrasound image time take complete spinal anesthesia . The number needle insertion redirections require achieve dural puncture also record ( previously define Chin et al. ) . Immediately spinal anaesthesia administer , patient ask observer rate pain experienced procedure ( 0 - 10 ) satisfaction procedure ( 1 - 5 ) . The sensory block height measure record 5 minute interval . The number 5 minute increment mean arterial blood pressure measure great 20 % baseline collect well amount ephedrine require treat patient . The amount intravenous fluid give procedure record . Other detail relate surgery also collect include time first incision , tourniquet inflation deflation time , estimate total blood loss time surgical completion . Any additional analgesia requirement procedure record well unexpected complication , include need convert general anesthetic . After procedure block height measure record 15 minute interval block height regress L3 . 5 . Statistical Analysis Power calculation base primary outcome reduction hypotension . From clinical experience previous study Carpenter et al . investigator anticipate 35 - 40 % reduction incidence hypotension Taylor 's approach group . Based p-value &lt; 0.05 sample size calculation 12 patient group . The investigator aim recruit 15 patient group .</detailed_description>
