	<detailed_description>A malfunction dysplasia pulmonary valve right ventricular outflow tract ( RVOT ) one major component cardiac physiology many congenital heart defect . Surgical correction complex heart defect often include form surgical repair replacement native RVOT biological valve homograft , bioprosthesis Xenografts ( i.e. , Contegra conduit ) . Typical example tetralogy Fallot ( TOF ) double outlet right ventricle ( DORV ) , pulmonary stenosis ( PS ) , pulmonary atresia ( PA ) , truncus arteriosus ( TA ) , transposition great artery ( TGA ) PS ( Rastelli 's operation ) , absent pulmonary valve syndrome ( Miller-Lev-Paul ) , Ross surgery aortic valve disease others . The repaired replace pulmonary valve however often become dysfunctional later many patient require surgical revision RVOT pulmonary valve replacement within 10 year primary intervention . TPVI provide less invasive alternative surgery patient right ventricular-to-pulmonary artery ( RV-PA ) conduit dysfunction . Early result percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation ( PPVI ) show promising procedure compare conventional surgical intervention . Meanwhile , pre-stenting RVOT PPVI routinely perform , enable PPVI various anatomy .</detailed_description>
