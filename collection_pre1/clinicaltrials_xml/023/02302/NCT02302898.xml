	<brief_title>Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Weight Regain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity affect third adult United States . The effective treatment weight loss bariatric surgery , common surgery perform US Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass ( RYGB ) . However , significant number patient regain weight lose surgery . The mechanisms weight regain likely multifactorial , well understood . Disordered eat behavior dilate gastrojejunostomies ( GJ ) , presumably allow patient consume large portion size meal , correlate weight regain . Moreover , data suggest change gut anatomy may drive eat behavior food preference . However , study simultaneously evaluate functional gastric volume ( volume solid liquid food consume level comfortable fullness one sit ) , anatomical gastric pouch size GJ diameter , eat behavior patient maintain post RYGB weight compare patient regain weight maximum weight loss RYGB determine relationship among post RYGB eat behavior , functional anatomical gastric pouch size , GJ diameter weight change . Accordingly , objective proposal compare 1 ) eat behavior 2 ) functional gastric volume 3 ) anatomical dimension gastric pouch GJ patient &gt; 2 year post RYGB regain &gt; 20 % maximum lose weight &gt; 2 year post RYGB maintain least 90 % weight loss since surgery . The follow specific aim evaluate : Aim 1 . Evaluate whether difference eat behavior exist subject maintain weight loss RYGB regain &gt; 20 % maximum lose weight . The investigator hypothesize subject regain weight RYGB high score binge eat behavior increase crave sweet compare patient maintain weight loss RYGB . Eating behavior determine perform Yale Food Addiction Scale ( YFAS ) , Eating Disorder Examination ( EDE ) , The Food Craving Inventory ( FCI ) , National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) ASA24 . Aim 2 . Evaluate whether difference exist functional gastric volume subject maintain weight loss RYGB regain &gt; 20 % maximum lose weight . The investigator hypothesize patient regain weight RYGB increase functional gastric volume solid liquid compare subject maintain weight loss RYGB . Functional gastric volume measure solid liquid meal test . Aim 3 . Evaluate whether difference exist gastric pouch GJ size subject maintain weight loss RYGB regain &gt; 20 % maximum lose weight . The investigator hypothesize patient regain weight RYGB increase gastric pouch size GJ diameter compare patient maintain weight loss RYGB . Anatomical dimension gastric pouch GJ determine use articulate measure tool upper GI tract endoscopy .</detailed_description>
