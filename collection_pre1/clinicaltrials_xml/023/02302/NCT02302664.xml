	<detailed_description>PURPOSE The aim study evaluate effectiveness treat rupture Achilles tendon autologous platelet rich plasma . The investigator plan compare outcome traditional method immobilisation cast outcome method apply platelet rich plasma rupture tendon . Spontaneous rupture Achilles tendon common tendon injury human body , account approximately 20 % major tendon rupture . Since 1950 's , incidence Achilles tendon rupture increase . The peak incidence ATR 30 40 year age , low current treatment associate significant risk rerupture Achilles tendonÍ¾ 15 % . Therapies currently dominate conflict priority rapid rehabilitation return work versus risk rerupture and/or surgery . New cost effective treatment reduce risk rerupture time functional healing need address challenge . Platelets blood cell form blood clot injure tissue . Platelets evolve millennia deliver combinatorial wound heal cocktail comprises 1100 active soluble membrane bound component , deliver sequentially timeframe minute lifespan platelet . Platelets platelet derived growth factor play important role healthy response injury , promote heal tissue , propose therapeutic agent . Their potential tendon repair demonstrate laboratory experiment animal model . One human investigation publish , small study athlete show accelerated return function platelet preparation patient blood complete Achilles tendon rupture . However , scientifically sound clinical research ass full potential use platelet preparation accelerate heal Achilles tendon . Despite lack high quality trial data , PRP administration remain potentially attractive strategy explore give relatively low cost minimally invasive . There recent steep growth PRP use musculoskeletal condition . It estimate PRP use treat 86,000 tendon disorder annually United States similar number Europe . There also evidence PRP injection introduce NHS clinical practice , addition wider use private medicine within United Kingdom . The investigator survey declaration use PRP NHS hospital discover four offering PRP tendon injury . Without evidence efficacy consequence range NHS incur extra cost treatment unproven clinical effect non deployment effective autologous intervention . There therefore press need undertake study use PRP become widely adopt . The result study may inform design potential future clinical trial optimal PRP therapy versus surgical repair ATR restore patient function . The National Institute Health Care Excellence ( NICE ) review PRP use ( IPG 438 ) state specialist adviser note establish practice concern participant expose intervention technique without adequate clinical investigation efficacy validity . NICE encourage research compare autologous blood injection ( without technique produce PRP ) establish nonsurgical method . The propose trial aim : 1 . Evaluate clinical efficacy PRP acute ATR term mechanical muscle tendon function . 2 . Evaluate clinical efficacy PRP acute ATR term patient report functional recovery , pain quality life . 3 . Determine key component PRP contribute mechanism action . 4 . Explore immunohistochemical response heal tendon PRP cellular tissue level . STUDY DESIGN Platelet Rich Plasma Achilles Tendon Healing ( PATH-2 ) pragmatic prospective multicentre , blind , randomise , placebo control trial two sub study embed within main study . The study aim evaluate clinical efficacy PRP acute ATR term mechanical muscle tendon function . To achieve goal study produce high level evidence PRP efficacy , study randomise control trial . The randomisation reduce risk bias control arm help eliminate placebo effect . Patients assessor blind applied treatment reduce risk bias . The PATH-2 study take place minimum 15 NHS hospital across UK . Participants identify orthopaedic/trauma outpatient clinic , usually follow emergency hospital attendance Achilles tendon rupture . The investigator anticipate surgeon confirm appropriateness nonsurgical treatment eligibility . A member local research team carry inform consent process , baseline data collection randomisation . Participants randomise via telephone website randomisation service , allocate receive either 'PRP injection ' 'Imitation ( placebo ) injection ' . Treatment administer surgeon outpatient visit . Those involved treatment delivery aware treatment allocation due nature intervention . Participants remain blind allocation throughout study . There four blind outcome assessment 4 , 7 , 13 24 week treatment . For first three ( 4 , 7 , 13 week ) response collect telephone hospital outpatient visit ( coincides local follow-up ) . The final follow-up require hospital attendance 24 week , face-to-face interview assessment physiotherapist/assessor . At visit , primary outcome ( HRET ) collect . The two embed sub study : 1 . Sub study 1 : Blood component ( participant , site ) PRP component analysis ( PRP intervention arm ) . A blood sample take participant consent randomisation prior treatment . The sample analyse compare composition blood cell type . PRP sample prepare accord treatment allocation portion remain treatment . This sent central laboratory later analysis ( blood cell count , growth factor platelets viability ) . 2 . Sub study 2 : Immunohistochemistry analysis ( 16 participant select site give consent undergo sample collection procedure ) . A needle biopsy heal Achilles tendon ultrasound guidance take outpatient visit . Samples undergo immunohistochemistry analysis centrally specialist laboratory .</detailed_description>
