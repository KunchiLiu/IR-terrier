	<brief_summary>Iron supplementation common athlete , probably due catalytic role oxygen transport optimal function oxidative enzyme protein exercise . Iron also characterize potent pro-oxidant , lead increase production reactive oxygen nitrogen specie ( RONS ) involve critical biological process , gene expression , signal transduction enzyme activity . In exercise , low level RONS essential optimal force production , whereas excessive production RONS cause contractile dysfunction , result muscle weakness fatigue . On hand , RONS involve signal pathway up-regulation expression several gene , therefore , RONS provoke favorable effect train adaptation . The purpose present study investigate effect iron supplementation redox status , muscle damage muscle performance acute bout valid muscle damage eccentric exercise model adult child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iron Supplementation Eccentric Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eccentric muscle work essential part human daily activity , walking , particular , walk downhill descend stair . It also component almost athletic action . The notable well-described effect eccentric exercise muscle damage peak one three day exercise accompany several hematological , biochemical physiological response . Excessive production reactive oxygen nitrogen specie ( RONS ) report result eccentric exercise . The typical approach far , provide antioxidant minimize oxidative stress , yet effectiveness approach still debate . Earlier study report positive effect antioxidant supplementation muscle performance , muscle damage redox status , whereas recently , well-received study point towards negative impact antioxidant supplementation . Iron essential element completion numerous important biological function , also optimal exercise performance . It vital component formation oxygen-transport iron-storage protein hemoglobin myoglobin , favorable function many oxidative enzyme affect intracellular metabolism . Therefore , iron supplementation commonly use avoid exercise-induced perturbation iron homeostasis maintain require iron store necessary address exercise need enhance physical performance . Iron also characterize potent pro-oxidant , lead increase production reactive oxygen nitrogen specie ( RONS ) involve critical biological process , gene expression , signal transduction enzyme activity . Nevertheless , role iron modify redox response eccentric exercise yet examine . In double blind , randomize cross study conduct two cycle , healthy men boys receive either iron supplement ( 37mg elemental iron per day three week one week eccentric exercise ) placebo . Blood sample collect : ) adult prior , end first supplementation period , 24 , 48,72 96 hour follow acute bout eccentric exercise ( 5 set x 15 max rep ) , b ) child prior , end first supplementation period 72 hour follow exercise protocol . Blood drawing repeat time point second supplementation cycle . The aims present research investigate : - The effect acute bout eccentric exercise muscle performance , redox status , iron status . - The effect three week iron supplementation muscle performance , redox status , iron status . - The effect four week iron supplementation muscle damage , muscle performance , redox status acute eccentric exercise bout . - The effect age muscle damage , muscle performance redox status acute eccentric exercise bout iron supplementation .</detailed_description>
