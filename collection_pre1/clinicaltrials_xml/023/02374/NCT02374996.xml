	<brief_summary>Insulin hormone produce body regulate blood sugar . Insulin resistance state body use insulin correctly , insulin need maintain normal blood sugar . Insulin resistance common bipolar patient even common bipolar patient treat antipsychotic . Insulin resistance antipsychotic lead type 2 diabetes , metabolic syndrome cardiovascular disease know lead bad psychiatric outcome ( less mood stability ) low life expectancy bipolar disorder . Abnormal regulation folate cycle know play role antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance main endpoint folate cycle production methyl donor DNA methylation . DNA methylation critical regulates gene express . Thus , change DNA methylation may play role disease process antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance . The purpose study examine difference DNA methylation candidate tissue know role development insulin resistance . The three group bipolar patient study 1 ) antipsychotic treat patient impaired glucose tolerance , 2 ) antipsychotic treated patient normal glucose tolerance 3 ) lithium treat patient normal glucose tolerance . Group 1 compare group 2 3 order ass DNA methylation skeletal muscle fat tissue change due medication effect ( group 2 vs. 3 ) medication side effect ( group 1 vs. 2 ) . Secondary analysis include analysis fat process skeletal muscle fat tissue relation antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance correlation DNA methylation across different tissue . The investigator hypothesize antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance due change way DNA express ( epigenetic change ) cause change way fat process body eventually leading insulin resistance . This work base preliminary finding however work need identify true mechanism behind antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance particular , main tissue mechanism occur .</brief_summary>
