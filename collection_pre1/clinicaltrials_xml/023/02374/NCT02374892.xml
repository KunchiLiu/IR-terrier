	<brief_summary>The CHAPTER III Study ( Congenital Heart Adolescents Participating Transition Evaluation Research ) cluster randomize control trial evaluate impact nurse-led transition intervention combination usual care , versus usual care alone , prepare adolescent congenital heart disease ( CHD ) successfully transition pediatric adult cardiology care . The Canadian Pediatric Society American Academy Pediatrics recommend transition intervention begin early adolescence . Therefore , investigator propose conduct nurse-led intervention address educational need 13-14 year old .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The number youth young adult congenital heart disease ( CHD ) rapidly increase , yet youth , parent , health care provider ( HCPs ) unprepared manage health care transition pediatric adult cardiology care . Both youth parent report significant anxiety regard transition process . When transition manage well , youth may engage adult HCPs , may lead late detection new problem , excess morbidity , diminish quality life.This speak urgency address clinical health service research gap , leave affect youth , family , HCPs , policy maker insufficient evidence transition program delivery . OBJECTIVE : The primary aim determine impact nurse-led transition intervention combination usual care , compare usual care alone , self-management self-advocacy skill among 13-14 year old moderate complex CHD use validated instrument . [ Hypothesis : transition intervention result superior self-management self-advocacy skill compare usual care alone ] . The secondary aim determine knowledge CHD lesion [ Hypothesis : transition intervention result superior knowledge CHD lesion compare usual care alone ] . METHODS : Study Participants Inclusion criterion : 13-14 year old moderate complex CHD ( previously define ) follow Stollery Children 's Hospital ( Edmonton ) . Exclusion criterion : ( ) less Grade 6 level reading comprehension , base parent report ; ( ii ) heart transplantation , result distinct health challenge . STUDY DESIGN : Subjects randomize cluster define week attendance pediatric cardiology clinic . Because week unit randomization study subject , cluster randomization design . We anticipate 1-2 subject per week enrol per site , i.e . cluster size â‰¤ 2 . INTERVENTIONS : This intervention conduct cardiology nurse experience work teen one-on-one session approximately 60 minute length . Sessions youth-oriented , interactive , engage . This session hold conjunction schedule pediatric cardiology clinic visit . This timing minimize study burden consistent Canadian Pediatric Society recommendation transition intervention deliver clinical setting . Individual session , contrast group session , allow intervention content patient-specific . Immediately prior session , RN review cardiology chart familiarize self cardiac history include cardiac diagnosis , name date cardiac surgical procedure cardiac catheterization , current cardiac medication dos . The one-on-one session combine Education introduction Self-Management . It involve introduction transition importance , discussion confidentiality promote trust RN , creation MyHealth passport , review diagram illustrate teen 's cardiac anatomy , introduction website Sick Kids Good2Go program , youth-oriented YoungAndHealthy , introduce youth-friendly write material risk-taking behaviour , review video good bad interaction health care provider encouragement contact RN study email address text message follow-up questions.. STUDY PROCEDURE : Potential study participant approach Stollery Children 's Hospital Cardiology clinic . A trained project coordinator approach subject `` intervention '' day `` usual care '' day . The nature purpose study explain informed consent seek teen 's parent ( ) /guardian ( ) . MEASURES : 1 . The TRANSITION-Q score Canadian create , generic self-management skill scale use adolescent diagnose chronic health condition age 12 18 year . The content scale design include range skill vary even young adolescent able ( e.g . answer doctor 's nurse 's question ) skill may require instruction training ( e.g . book appointment ) .consists knowledge scale behavior index report youth health self-care relate knowledge behavior . 2 . Knowledge cardiac condition measure MyHeart Scale . 3 . Chart review : Descriptive data collect cardiology chart : date birth , CHD diagnosis , names date cardiac surgical procedure cardiac catheterization , current use cardiac medication ( Y/N ) , history miss appointment ( Y/N ) , cardiologist 's name . Youth complete MyHeart Scale TRANSITION-Q Questionnaire clinic area enrollment `` usual care '' group , prior intervention `` intervention '' group . Both group repeat questionnaire 1 month 6 month post enrollment .</detailed_description>
