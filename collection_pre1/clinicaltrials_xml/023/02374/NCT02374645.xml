If patient decline participate voluntary exploratory research and/or genetic component study penalty loss benefit patient exclude aspect study . 2 . Male female age least 18 year old . 3 . Histologically cytologically confirm locally advanced metastatic NSCLC patient harbour EGFR mutation know associated EGFRTKI sensitivity ( include exon 19 deletion , L858R , L861Q , G719X ) . Local test EGFR mutation acceptable . In expansion phase , patient must positive cMet test central laboratory . Safety runin phase : EGFR mutation positive . A local EGFR test result acceptable Expansion phase : EGFR mutation positive cMetpositive . cMet test perform central lab . 4 . Radiological documentation disease progression previous continuous treatment EGFRTKI eg , gefitinib erlotinib . All patient must document radiological progression last treatment administer prior enrol study . The patient must treat EGFRTKI objective clinical benefit ( CR/PR ) SD 3 month , subsequently show radiological progression treatment . In addition , line therapy may give . 5 . At least 1 lesion , previously irradiate , biopsied screening period , accurately measure baseline ≥10 mm long diameter ( except lymph node must short axis ≥15 mm ) compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) suitable accurate repeat measurement . 6 .

Women agree use adequate contraceptive measure ( define section 5.1 ) , breast feeding , must negative pregnancy test prior start dose childbearing potential nonchild bear potential must evidence fulfil 1 follow criterion screen : Postmenopausal define age 50 year amenorrhoeic least 12 month follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment Documentation irreversible surgical sterilisation hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy bilateral salpingectomy tubal ligation Women 50 year age would consider postmenopausal amenorrhoeic least 12 month follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment , serum folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) luteinizing hormone ( LH ) level postmenopausal range institution . 8 . Sexually active male patient willing use barrier contraception ; ie , condom . 9 . For inclusion genetic research , patient must provide informed consent genetic research . 1 . Intervention follow : Treatment EGFRTKI within approximately 5x halflife ( eg , within 8 day erlotinib , gefitinib afatanib , within 10 day dacomitinib ) first dose study treatment Any cytotoxic chemotherapy , investigational agent anticancer drug treatment advance NSCLC previous treatment regimen clinical study within 14 day first dose study treatment Patients currently receive ( unable stop use least 2 week ) prior receive first dose AZD6094 , medication know strong inhibitor CYP1A2 ( Appendix E ) Prior current treatment AZD6094 another cMet inhibitor ( eg , foretinib , crizotinib , cabozantinib , onartuzumab ) Concurrent use hormone noncancerrelated condition ( eg , insulin diabetes hormone replacement therapy ) acceptable . 2 . Radiotherapy limit field radiation palliation within 1 week first dose study treatment , exception patient receive radiation 30 % bone marrow wide field radiation must complete ≥4 week first dose study treatment . 3 . Major surgical procedure , ( exclude placement vascular access ) significant traumatic injury within 4 week first dose study treatment , anticipate need major surgery study 4 . With exception alopecia CTCAE Grade 2 , prior chemotherapyrelated neuropathy , unresolved toxicity prior therapy and/or prestudy biopsy great CTCAE Grade 1 time start study treatment 5 . Have nonmeasurable disease baseline per RECIST v1.1 . To ensure patient able complete evaluable period study assessment progression perform accord RECIST v1.1 criterion relevant treatment decision apply OR summarise patient measurable disease baseline 6 . Presence active cancer , history treatment invasive cancer ≤5 year . Patients Stage I cancer receive definitive local treatment least 3 year previously , consider unlikely recur eligible . All patient previously treat situ carcinoma ( i.e. , noninvasive ) eligible , patient history nonmelanoma skin cancer . 7 . Current leptomeningeal metastasis spinal cord compression . Brain metastasis permit treated , asymptomatic , stable ( require steroid least 4 week prior start study treatment ) . 8 . Patients know tumour thrombus deep vein thrombosis eligible stable low molecular weight heparin ≥4 week . 9 . As judged Investigator , evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease , include uncontrolled hypertension , renal transplant , active bleeding diatheses , Investigator 's opinion make undesirable patient participate trial would jeopardise compliance protocol ; include evidence active infection include hepatitis B ( HBV ) surface antigen , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) antibody human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Screening chronic condition require . 10 . Any serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection would impair patient 's ability receive IP , condition associate frequent diarrhoea . 11 . Any following cardiac criterion : Mean rest correct QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 470 msec obtain triplicate ECGs Any clinically important abnormality rhythm , conduction morphology rest ECG ; eg , complete leave bundle branch block , third degree heart block , second degree heart block , PR interval &gt; 250 msec Any factor increase risk QTc prolongation risk arrhythmic event heart failure , hypokalaemia , congenital long QT syndrome , family history long QT syndrome unexplained sudden death 40 year age concomitant medication know prolong QT interval− Inadequately control hypertension ( ie , systolic blood pressure ( BP ) &gt; 160 mmHg diastolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg ( patient value level must BP controlled medication prior start treatment ) .
