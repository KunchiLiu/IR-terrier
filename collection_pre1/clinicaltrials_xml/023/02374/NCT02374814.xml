	<brief_title>Immunogenicity Rabies Vaccine Pre Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory vaccine trial evaluate immunogenicity non-licensed dosing schedule route administration currently FDA license rabies vaccine pre-exposure prophylaxis rabies infection . The goal study characterize immune response persistence immunity shorten dose schedule intradermal ( ID ) administration , relative current license dosing schedule rabies vaccine ( 3 dose ( 0 , 7 , 21 day ) IM ) . Rabies virus endemic throughout world due high rate wild domestic animal rabies risk deploy military endemic area considerable . Currently commonly support pre-exposure prophylaxis regimen rabies , United States comprise three , 1.0 ml intramuscular ( IM ) injection human diploid cell vaccine ( HDCV ) purify chick embryo cell ( PCEC ) rabies vaccine day 0 , 7 , 21 28 . Modified , two three dose schedule intradermal ( ID ) injections 0.1 ml HDCV PCEC utilize outside US . These two three dose intradermal schedule share similar safety immunogenicity profile intramuscular vaccination easily boost one year vaccination . A death , rabies , US Soldier return Afghanistan underscore importance rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis soldier need evaluate safest , effective mean vaccinate large deploying force . While current three dose , 1 ml IM rabies series effective , shorten , equally effective vaccination series significantly small dose per injection would greatly improve logistics cost associate universal even target coverage deploy soldier . Evaluation shorter , smaller-dose , pre-exposure vaccination series rabies goal study .</detailed_description>
