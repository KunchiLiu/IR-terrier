	<brief_title>Phase II Study With Ga101-DHAP Induction Therapy Relapsed/Refractory DLBCL Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicenter , single arm , phase II trial young patient ( 18-65 year ) affect relapsed/refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) diagnosis , eligible high-dose therapy . Aim study ass whether addition GA101 DHAP promise standard R-DHAP , induction therapy high dose chemotherapy BEAM ASCT respect response . The study design primarily evaluate efficacy GA101-DHAP patient DLBCL relapse refractory one chemotherapy regimen secondarily assess safety capability mobilize peripheral stem cell The study design two stage stop rule first stage . In particular , end first stage , study stop efficacy low toxicity , measure drug administration period , high respect pre-defined threshold . .</detailed_description>
