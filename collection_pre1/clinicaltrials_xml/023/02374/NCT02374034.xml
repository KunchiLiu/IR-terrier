	<brief_title>Effect Egoscue Corrective Exercise Prescription Acute Short-term Chronic Knee Hip Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants study recruit university community via email announcement flyer . Participants adults chronic knee and/or hip pain . Chronic pain define pain day week least 12 week . Individuals exclude study ( ) undergone knee hip surgery sustain knee hip injury past 12 month , ( b ) currently receive form pain treatment physiotherapy , chiropractic , intraarticular injection , prescription pain medication , ( c ) exhibit severe lack mobility , ( ) report initial pain level &lt; 3 cm Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) scale , ( e ) pregnant , ( f ) unable understand English . Individuals exclude participation take non-prescription drug nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug , although require refrain take pain medication 12 hour precede first , subsequent assessment . A power analysis use power level 80 % alpha set 0.05 indicated sample size 40 participant ( 20 control group 20 exercise group ) . A large effect size ( 0.80 ) assume report literature26 difference Western Ontario McMaster Universities Arthritis Index ( WOMAC ) score follow at-home exercise program . Forty-two eligible participant originally recruit . All participant complete pre-participation questionnaire include question age , gender , injury , pain medication use , previous plan total hip and/or knee arthroplasty . Participants complete two version VAS knee and/or hip pain : one pain rest one pain movement . If participant pain multiple joint , tell record overall level pain . Participants tell indicate `` usual pain '' past seven day . Participants need VAS pain score least 3 cm ( either rest movement ) order participate study . Participants also complete WOMAC time visit . Participants ' body mass measure near 0.1 kg height near 0.5 cm use digital scale stadiometer , respectively . Egoscue Method protocol follow postural alignment specialist train postural evaluation conduct assessment . To reduce possible inter-rater error , researcher conduct postural evaluation . An individualized exercise program ( E-cise menu ) generate use ePeteTM software ( version 4.4.3 ) base noted postural deviation . To ensure participant prescribed volume exercise , E-cise menu adjust add remove exercise time require complete exercise approximately 45 minute . Participants exercise group lead complete E-cise menu researcher ensure competency exercise . Participants control group perform exercise 45 minute . Following first exercise session 45 minute rest , participant complete VAS current knee and/or hip pain rest movement . All participant give log ( one day week ) , fill every evening retire bed . These log contain question compliance E-cise menu ( exercise group ) , pain medication use , VAS pain rest movement . Participants control group instruct maintain current lifestyle two week duration study return visit schedule one week later . Participants exercise group schedule return visit follow day E-cises could observe competency adjustment could make E-cise menu participant experience pain E-cise . Participants exercise group instruct complete E-cise menu home least five day week , preferably every day , next two week . All participant assess evaluated variable previously mention end week number 1 end study week number 2 . Participants control group give personalize E-cise menu , along instruction , time .</detailed_description>
