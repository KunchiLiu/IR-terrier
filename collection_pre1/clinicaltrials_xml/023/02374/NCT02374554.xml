Patient Enrolment Procedures : A maximum 43 subject enrol across 2 site achieve 34 evaluable data set : - 24 Patients Respiratory disease/impairment ( minimum 7 maximum 17 enrolled site ) - 10 Normal subject current previous diagnosis respiratory disease ( minimum 3 maximum 7 enrolled site ) Sample Size : A sample size 34 subject determined yield least 80 % power MSD 0.4 . A previous study find MSD test device Embletta device 0.31 , thus conservatively use value 0.4 calculate power . In study , mean difference -0.26 standard deviation difference 0.49 . We assume 80 % enrolled subject yield evaluable data . Specifically , enrol sample size 43 subject yield 43*.80 = 34 evaluable subject . This sample size yield least 80 % power true MSD 0.4 small . The study consist one stage , consist : - Each participant measure simultaneously device 1 occasion duration 5-9 minute . - The participant measure seated position . Measurement Devices : End Tidal C02 measure use Capnograph ( BCI Capnograph 9004 , Smiths Medical ) . Expired gas collect via nasal cannula sample line moisture trap . Expired gas sample flow rate 150 mL/min ± 20 ml . The device average delay time 1.8 second response time 2.1 second take account analysis . The BCI Capnograph 9004 display range 0 - 100 mmHg accurate ±2 mmHg , information find device instruction manual . Capnograph waveform record computer utilise analogue output capnograph . The analogue output sample 30 Hz use 16 bit analogue digital converter ( Micro 1401-3 , Cambridge Electronic Design , UK ) . The sample rate 30 Hz select since equal display update rate waveform device , therefore close clinician commonly assess . Clinician over-scored capnographic RR derive capnogram CO2 waveform . The Capnography device calibrate accord manufacturer instruction . The range Respiration rate Capnography device 0 -150 brpm . Thoraco-abdominal movement measure use Thora-3Di . The grid size use 14 x 10 . Five minute continuous rest tidal breathing data acquire subject . The signal sample 30 Hz represent anterior thoraco-abdominal breathing motion . The Thora-3Di software provide numerical output RR mean brpm , calculate SLPVol/Time trace select time frame . The five minute continuous rest tidal breathing data collect simultaneously device . Data Transfer : Capnographic output acquire save data file subsequent processing review . The Thora-3Di™ software thoraco-abdominal signal export comma-separated value ( CSV ) file . Before data analysis , measurement assess quality , protocol violator identify . The Thora-3Di™ device software detect noise level output signal , software flag measurement excessively noisy measurement obtain . For example , patient move upper body , may prohibit valid Thora-3Di™ measurement record . Likewise , interference , condensation within , Capnography sample tubing may produce artefact prevent valid Capnography trace record . Where paired sample obtain due protocol violation , render data unanalyzable subject exclude analysis . Details protocol violator tabulate reason exclusion list . Any specific sub-population disease state Thora-3Di™ work expect noted .
