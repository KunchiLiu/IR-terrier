	<brief_summary>Gamma Knife Radiosurgery ( GKR ) well establish treatment modality brain tumor functional disorder brain . It rely mathematical algorithm predict dose distribution calculate dose arbitrary point head . For last 25 year , dos apply use Gamma Knife Radiosurgery calculate use simple algorithm , call Tissue Maximum Ratio algorithm ( TMR ) . Dose plan use algorithm , rely number approximation enable fast isodose computation treatment planning . One significant approximation head water-equivalent density . The increased electron density brain bone ( relative water ) near-zero density air cavity skull may make significant perturbation isodose beam-on time calculation . With advent faster workstation , effect tissue in-homogeneities finally calculate reasonable time treatment planning process ; newer , modern algorithm know convolution algorithm commercially available . It use value density indicate CT scan predict dose distribution expect accurately calculate radiation dose , although needs investigation clinical implementation . Inter- intra-indication difference old new algorithm need understood method confidently employ clinical setting . It aim study understand dosimetric difference dose calculation algorithm evaluate implication use convolution algorithm GKR . A large number treatment re-planned use convolution algorithm compare TMR plan use treat patient . Beam-on-time , proportional dose number commonly use metric target coverage , selectivity , gradient index , mean maximum dose , estimate algorithm . Subgroup analysis do ass whether factor diagnosis , size head location target could impact relative difference method . The treatment plan compare potential implication treatment planning elucidate .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult patient receive Gamma Knife treatment diagnosis Gamma Knife centre QSRC . The subject consent participate study consent stereotactic non contrast CT scan brain GKR finish . Inability consent Younger 18 year age : Children eligible give consent moment adult treat QSRC . Patient suitable CT scan : There absolute clinical contraindication CT scan . However , purpose study , pregnancy consider absolute contraindication . Claustrophobia anxiety disorder consider relative contraindication ; however , likely affect subject ability tolerate Gamma Knife treatment MRI scanning , would make patient eligible study . Comorbidity previous treatment patient consider exclusion criterion .</criteria>
