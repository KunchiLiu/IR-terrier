	<detailed_description>Fetal monitoring relies sensor measure uterine activity fetal heart rate . Monitoring contraction labor use external tocodynamometer relies measurement activity abdominal wall sometimes unreliable inaccurate .In case difficulty monitor uterine wall activity abdominal wall increase risk uterine wall rupture , commonly use alternative invasive intrauterine pressure catheter monitor ( IUPC ) . The IUPC apply gently behind head fetus rupture membranes spontaneously artificially uterine cavity . Insertion IUPC monitor may associate rare serious complication include placental abruption uterine rupture . Non invasive method allow accurate precise monitoring uterine muscle activity well search Lately , new electrohysterography ( EHG ) device introduce alternative standard intrauterine sensor . ( Nemo Healthcare 's , Netherlands , PUREtrace ) . When muscle cell contract , small change occur electrical potential across cell wall . During contraction , electrical activity uterine muscle measure maternal abdomen . EHG develop measure electrical muscle activity uterus directly , claim offer highly accurate information correlate exist invasive measurement method uterine contraction . Vlemminx et al , show EHG also appear report detail tocographic waveform , like hypertonia unorganized electrical uterine activity . The EHG use Graphium electrode patch apply abdomen record electrical activity non-invasively . Its ' module amplifies convert signal recognize measurement method uterine activity , commonly use fetal monitoring . This measurement independent Body-Mass-Index , abdominal wall thickness maternal position enable monitor obese patient well . By use Graphium electrode patch patient comfort increase significantly compare measurement method . The patch also easy apply medical staff require repositioning time . It provide safe patient-friendly alternative measure uterine activity , without need change exist fetal monitoring infrastructure . The aim study investigate accuracy electrohysterography compare intrauterine pressure catheter commonly use delivery room order promote less invasive management protocol future order well predict uterine muscle dysfunction labor . This case control prospective study . Women second phase labor - indicated insertion intrauterine pressure catheter due previous uterine scar , multifetal pregnancy , grand multiparity dysfunctional labor ask participate . Patients give inform consent participate study , connect IUPC EHG.Medical history demographic parameter take . The graph compare analyzed frequency intensity . Delivery mode fetal well-being record</detailed_description>
