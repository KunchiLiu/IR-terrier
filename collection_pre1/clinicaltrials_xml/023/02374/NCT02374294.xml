	<brief_summary>In colorectal surgery , oxygen insufflation ( lead high oxygen concentration surgical site ) show decrease infection rate . Several pressure wound coccyx successfully treat closure Transdermal Continuous Oxygen Therapy ( TCOT ) Given wind heal property TCOT , particularly infection-prone anatomic location coccyx , microbicidal property oxygen , expect infection rate abdominoperineal ( AP ) resection surgery reduce transdermal continuous oxygen therapy . The primary objective study compare number surgical site infection associate perineal surgery within 28 day subject randomize receive EPIFLO Standard Care</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TCOT Effectiveness Preventing Wound Infections Perineal Resections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EPIFLO Small , silent disposable , battery-operated oxygen concentrator capable deliver 98 % 100 % oxygen ( balance moisture ) seven day rate ~3.0 ml/hour ; 60 '' long sterile cannula ( tube ) conveys oxygen concentrator area beneath bandage overlie wound . The primary objective study compare number surgical site infection associate perineal surgery within 30 day subject randomize receive EPIFLO Standard Care . Secondary Study objectives include Resource utilization duration hospitalization . Hypothesis 1 : The proportion surgical site infection low patient treat Transdermal Continuous Oxygen Therapy ( TCOT ) Hypothesis 2 : In patient develop infection , wound small heal rapidly treat Transdermal Continuous Oxygen Therapy . Key Safety Assessments Include potential dermatological toxicity change attribute EPIFLO measure observe report discomfort change skin Treatment Period ( It essential establish difference toxicity dress vs. toxicity arise EPIFLO ) . This Study randomize control trial 30 patient age 18-80 year schedule undergo elective perineal resection surgery University Maryland Medical Center . This study design Phase II safety &amp; efficacy study . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize receive interventional device Standard Care Standard Care ( 1:1 ) . The patient equally divide two arm . Sham device involve study . Wound infection diagnose investigator use Centers Disease Control Prevention Criteria . As additional measure prevent bias , picture wound may send independent clinical specialist assessment infection ; specialist blind get objective opinion . The expected time study 1 month ( 27-30 day ) . This include screening period occur subject consent study ( sign inform consent ) surgery ( day 1 ) . The screening period 28 day . While study , four study visit : Visit 1 day 1 day surgery , randomization . The second study visit day post surgery discharge ( day 3-5 ) . The third study visit 14 day follow surgery , ( day 14 ) Final study visit day post surgical follow visit ( day 28 ) . The total treatment period may 14 28 day . After 14-days treatment , wound completely heal , treatment phase complete . If wound completely heal receive additional 14 day treatment . Either way patient 's healing progress follow total study duration 30 day .</detailed_description>
