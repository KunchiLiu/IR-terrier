	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Brain metastases common serious complication metastatic melanoma . Up 50 % patient develop brain metastasis course illness , approximately 20 % patient first presentation metastatic disease . The prognosis melanoma patient brain metastasis generally poor median overall survival range 2.8 4 month large proportion 95 % patient ultimately die direct result brain metastasis . The prognosis patient melanoma brain metastasis change 1986 2007 . The five year survival rate 15 % late stage disease . LOCAL TREATMENT OPTIONS There 3 treatment modality use local management brain metastasis : surgery , stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) , whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) . Surgery SRS direct tumour volume , whereas WBRT delivers lower-dose radiotherapy whole brain , include area overt tumour . Surgery limit size tumour ; however , dependent lesion surgically accessible . In appropriately select patient ( lesion &gt; 3 cm minimal symptom ) , SRS consider equivalent surgical resection ; however , address 1 randomise control trial stop early poor accrual . No statistically significant difference find survival local tumour control . In solid tumour , WBRT remain treatment modality choice surgery SRS contraindicate tumour size , number , location . The role WBRT palliate symptom , despite response rate 60 % , median survival le 5 month . SYSTEMIC THERAPY OPTIONS Systemic chemotherapy show little benefit treatment metastatic melanoma , include brain metastasis . It usually reserve central nervous system ( CNS ) progression despite surgery and/or radiotherapy , patient rapidly progress symptomatic extracranial disease . The response rate brain active chemotherapy agent temozolomide fotemustine &lt; 10 % large clinical trial , thus patient brain metastasis exclude systemic therapy clinical trial . Ipilimumab first systemic treatment proven extend survival patient metastatic melanoma , activity progress brain metastasis patient take corticosteroids neurological symptom . Dabrafenib vemurafenib potent selective BRAF inhibitor proven increase survival patient V600 BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma activity brain metastasis . Although unprecedented proven activity BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib large clinical trial patient untreated V600 BRAF-mutant brain metastasis , represent 40 % metastatic melanoma population , responses rarely durable . Brain metastases remain major clinical problem , unmet medical need patient BRAF-mutant wild-type metastatic melanoma . And yet , major clinical trial continue exclude patient . IMMUNOTHERAPY Cancer immunotherapy rest premise tumour recognize foreign rather 'self ' effectively attack activate immune system . An effective immune response set think rely immune surveillance tumour antigen express cancer cell ultimately result adaptive immune response cancer cell death . This function abort emergence tumour arise and/or cause tumour shrinkage present . Meanwhile , tumour progression may depend upon acquisition trait allow cancer cell evade immune surveillance effective immune response . This evasion may occur exploit checkpoint control regulatory immune response , include display antigen control co-stimulatory pathway affect proliferation cell involve immunity . Current immunotherapy effort attempt break apparent tolerance immune system tumour cell antigens either introduce cancer antigens therapeutic vaccination modulate regulatory checkpoint immune system - either directly stimulation immune cell antibody direct receptor T B cell indirectly cytokine manipulation . T-cell stimulation complex process involve integration numerous positive , well negative , co-stimulatory signal addition antigen recognition T-cell receptor ( TCR ) . Collectively , signal govern balance T-cell activation tolerance antigen . NIVOLUMAB Nivolumab fully human monoclonal antibody direct negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor PD-1 ( program death-1 program cell death-1/PCD-1 ) immunopotentiation activity . The efficacy safety nivolumab explore 3 ongoing melanoma phase 3 trial previously treat treatment naïve patient . IPILIMUMAB In study investigate safety activity ipilimumab specifically patient brain metastasis , ipilimumab show activity patient advance melanoma brain metastasis , particularly metastases small asymptomatic patient need corticosteroid treatment . Furthermore , drug unexpected toxic effect population . NIVOLUMAB COMBINED WITH IPILIMUMAB Preclinical preliminary clinical evidence suggest synergy nivolumab ipilimumab . While PD-1 CTLA-4 co-inhibitory molecule , evidence suggests use distinct mechanism limit T cell activation . The preliminary clinical evidence demonstrate high frequency patient substantial tumour burden reduction combination nivolumab ipilimumab . Improved overall survival associate substantial tumour burden reduction note immunotherapy . For instance , improve overall survival note metastatic melanoma patient obtain complete response IL-2 . If observation also applicable treatment nivolumab combine ipilimumab could also potential large improvement overall survival compare ipilimumab . STUDY DESIGN Initially , study recruit patient melanoma brain metastasis receive prior local treatment intracranial metastatic disease asymptomatic ( Cohort 1 ) parallel , patient previously treat brain metastasis , symptom , concurrent leptomeningeal disease ( Cohort 2 ) . Combination therapy nivolumab ipilimumab currently investigation phase III trial previously untreated metastatic melanoma ( NCT01844505 ) . That study however exclude patient active brain metastasis . This current study therefore enrol third group patient brain metastasis receive prior treatment metastatic disease asymptomatic receive combine nivolumab ipilimumab ( Cohort 3 ) . Recruitment cohort 3 commence first 6 patient cohort 1 receive least 3 dos study treatment ( equivalent 6 week ) satisfactory adverse event record . A satisfactory record deem ≤ 2 patient experience neurological CTCAE grade 3 nivolumab-related adverse event . Following safety assessment , safety signal detect , patient continue recruit cohort enable complete patient group 30 . To minimise bias , treatment allocation cohort 3 remainder cohort 1 assign unequal randomisation ratio achieve overall balance 30 patient receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg ( include 6 patient cohort 1 ) 30 patient receive combination treatment . Randomisation remain cohort 1 cohort 3 stratify participate site minimise potential difference patient present different site , difference site . CONTINUED TREATMENT IN SELECT CASES OF PROGRESSIVE DISEASE Accumulating clinical evidence indicate patient treat immune system stimulate agent may develop progression disease ( conventional response criterion ) demonstrate clinical objective response and/or stable disease . enhance inflammation within tumour could lead increase tumour size would appear enlarged index lesion newly visible small non-index lesion . Over time , malignant inflammatory portion mass may decrease lead overt sign clinical improvement . Alternatively , individual , kinetics tumour growth may initially outpace anti-tumour immune activity . With sufficient time , anti-tumour activity dominate become clinically apparent . Therefore , patient allow continue study treatment initial investigator-assessed RECIST 1.1 define progression assess derive clinical benefit tolerate study drug . The application traditional RECIST criterion patient treat immunotherapy may lead premature discontinuation treatment patient eventually respond treatment prolonged disease stabilization . Disease progression may occur extracranial lesion whilst patient may continue disease stabilisation response intracranial melanoma disease , vice versa . INTRACRANIAL RESPONSE USING FET-PET FET PET ( 18F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine [ FET ] ) use separate independent modality MRI brain scan assess metabolic response brain metastasis immune therapy . FET PET extensively evaluate human . FET-PET show valuable management brain tumour . It known effect lymphocytic infiltration occur immune therapy MRI brain , important separate modality predict benefit ass response . FET-PET demonstrates change cell proliferation ( change SUV [ standardise uptake value ] baseline ) . FET-PET use assess determine response study treatment . The FET PET finding compare conventional imaging . Only cohorts 1 3 assessed modality . BLOOD AND TISSUE BIOMARKERS Blood collect examine serum chemokines , cytokine , inflammatory marker , lymphocyte T cell subset myeloid derive suppressor cell ( MDSC ) ass correlation disease response progression . In patient sufficient archival melanoma tissue metastatic site , baseline tumour PD-L1 level , immune marker genetics response resistance also measure . If available , tumour tissue follow progression disease also test immune genetic marker . Early work indicate biomarkers may predictive responder study treatment . In phase 1 study 90 patient receive nivolumab different dose level , high pre-treatment NY-ESO-1 MART-1-specific CD8+ T cell associate progression disease . At week 12 , increase peripheral-blood T regulatory cell decrease antigen-specific T cell associate progression . PD-L1 tumour staining associate response nivolumab , negative staining rule response .</detailed_description>
