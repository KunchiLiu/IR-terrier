Bolster dressing traditionally apply secure graft wound bed , however , evidence show irregularly contour recipient site , exude wound , poorly heal area , presence shear stress significantly reduce success rate skin-grafting traditional bolster dressing , increase morbidity , pain , hospital stay , cost . Negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) advocate potential solution issue . application NPWT skin-grafting may promote blood flow microcirculation graft bed , reduction edema , exudate , hematoma , result significant qualitative improvement split skin graft take .
