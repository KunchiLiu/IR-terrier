	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVE This study examine role irrigate bipolar radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation treatment intramural ventricular tachycardia patient fail standard unipolar RF ablation . The hypothesis increase current density improve rate transmural lesion creation see bipolar RF ablation lead successful arrhythmia termination minimal increase risk complication . INTRODUCTION , RATIONALE Radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation commonly employ method catheter treatment cardiac arrhythmia . Myocardial scar serf frequent substrate genesis atrial ventricular arrhythmia . Such scar frequently contain survive myocyte bundle intersperse fibrotic tissue , lead slow conduction . Areas denser fibrosis cause conduction block . When appropriately arrange , conduction around scar lead creation `` reentry '' circuit arrhythmia generate maintain . Each reentry circuit contain within area call isthmus , portion circuit locate position intimately related scar border zone . Electrical activation travel slowly isthmus break normal myocardium . Ablation site isthmus terminate reentrant tachycardia . A variety technique , include electroanatomic mapping activation , entrainment , substrate mapping , employ electrophysiologic ( EP ) study identify area myocardial scar potential isthmus site . Points line ablation use RF energy create attempt interrupt reentry circuit . Typically , unipolar RF energy apply via catheter tip electrode endocardial epicardial surface heart ground via electrode pad place patient 's skin . RF energy set dispersed entirety tissue catheter tip ground pad . The standard 7-French , 4-mm tip catheter highly successful ablate circuit locate within millimeter catheter tip . A focal , 1mm area resistive heating occur within myocardium immediately contact catheter tip ; myocardial cell death occur several millimeter deeply passive , conductive heating , spread outward contact point . While standard catheter effective ablation superficial arrhythmia , proven problematic use deep myocardial site create transmural lesion . A number alternative develop attempt access site . 8-mm 10-mm catheter tip able create large zone resistive heating , deliver direct RF energy large area myocardium . A large interface catheter tip blood improve cool allows delivery power without rise impedence . The clinical use large catheter , however , limited rapid temperature rise catheter-tissue interface , result thrombus formation , char , `` steam pop '' rupture endocardial surface . The use irrigated ablation catheter improve upon ability deliver RF energy without sustained rise impedance . Both open irrigated- closed-loop irrigated catheter circulate saline along catheter tip-myocardial interface , allow continued delivery RF current without thrombus formation endocardial surface . Intramyocardial temperature rise accordingly without concomitant endocardial temperature surge , create large deep myocardial ablation zone . Catheters feature retractable needle tip electrode intramyocardial saline infusion also show promise mean access deep myocardial circuit ventricular tachycardia ablation , currently available US . Transcoronary ethanol ablation also employ moderate success patient arrhythmias resistant endocardial catheter ablation . This technology , however , grant limit control size result infarct restrict need perfusion scar zone accessible coronary artery . Nevertheless , remain occasion arrhythmia eliminate standard unipolar ablation technique . This see frequently due deep intramural ventricular tachycardia , sometimes encounter follow myocardial infarction . Both standard alternative ablation strategy frequently either unavailable inadequate termination arrhythmia . Recently , several center employ irrigated bipolar ablation ( BA ) target arrhythmias amenable unipolar ablation . During BA , two catheter connect either pole RF generator , allow either catheter function `` active '' catheter `` return '' catheter . Rather dispersed catheter tip distant grounding pad , BA concentrate energy two catheter tip position oppose side target scar . BA may thus improve lesion transmurality synergistic , simultaneous heating increase current density lead concentrate thermal injury . Initial experience use BA technology mammalian heart demonstrate could successfully apply create discrete area myocardial necrosis minimal risk complication . When compare unipolar ablation , several study suggest BA could create large area necrosis transmural lesion rare episodes perforation . Subsequent experience human heart predominantly surgical : large number observational study review demonstrate effectiveness safety BA patient undergo pulmonary vein isolation Cox-Maze surgery either isolate procedure adjunct valve replacement coronary artery bypass surgery . Despite broad use surgical ablation , application BA catheter-based therapy limit . Recently , group demonstrate utility BA vitro model series patient arrhythmia resistant unipolar ablation . When compare unipolar RF ablation , BA find likely achieve transmural lesion porcine heart model ( 33 % vs 82 % , respectively , p = 0.001 ) could tissue 25 mm thickness . Clinically , septal atrial flutter , 5 6 septal VTs , 2 4 free-wall VTs successfully acutely terminate . The propose study examine role BA patient ventricular tachycardia resistant standard ablation technique .</detailed_description>
