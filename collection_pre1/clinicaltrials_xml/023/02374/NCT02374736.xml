	<brief_summary>The principal objective pilot study determine whether progression chronic antibody-mediated rejection ( ABMR ) could minimize post-transplant administration high dose Intravenous Immunoglobulins ( IVIg ) . We test hypothesis repetitive IVIg administration reduces stabilize progressive loss transplant function evolution chronic ABMR stable kidney transplant patient HLA-DSA developed post-transplantion ( de novo HLA-DSA ) concomitant humoral graft injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study assess effect IVIg associate conventional immunosuppressive treatment 15 stable transplant recipient post-transplant de novo HLA-DSA histological humoral lesion . The study include 2 period : - Treatment period , - Follow-up period . The treatment start day inclusion ( M0 ) : Privigen give 2 g/kg 2 days/month 6 month ( maximum dose : 80 g/day ) . Evaluation end treatment take place month 6 ( M6 ) . Evaluation end follow take place month 12 ( M12 ) . Blood urine sample collect day inclusion ( M0 ) , infusion Privigen , M6 M12 biological analysis ( serum creatinine , glomerular filtration rate , proteinuria ) . Blood sample collect day inclusion ( M0 ) , M6 M12 immunoassay ( HLA-DSA mean fluorescence intensity ) . Blood sample collect day inclusion ( M0 ) provide DNA bank . Blood sample collect day inclusion ( M0 ) , infusion Privigen M6 IgG dosage . Blood sample collect day inclusion ( M0 ) , infusion Privigen , M6 M12 provide serum bank . Blood sample collect day inclusion ( M0 ) , infusion Privigen , M6 M12 haematology , blood chemistry Coombs test . Histological characteristic ( kidney biopsy ) perform M0 M6 . The M6 biopsy specifically request protocol differs usual practice , usually perform M12 post transplantation . Infectious clinical event ( deceased patient , graft loss , acute biopsy-proven rejection episode infectious disease ) record follow-up period . Histology for-cause biopsy perform accord center practice . We recommend graft biopsy patient acute allograft dysfunction ( 20 % increase creatinine ) without current evident cause graft dysfunction . The maximum study duration subject , inclusion follow-up visit , 12 month estimate length time need complete entire study ( enrolment first subject completion last subject ) 18 month .</detailed_description>
