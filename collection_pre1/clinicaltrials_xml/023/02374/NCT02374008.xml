	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose study evaluate postoperative analgesic effect combine Saphenous nerve block Obturator nerve block local infiltration analgesia tissue around knee total kneearthroplasty . In combined nerve block use mixture Ropivacaine Adrenaline combine high dose systemic dexamethasone Ketorolac mixture local infiltration consist Ropivacaine , Adrenaline Ketoroloc . The investigator hypothesis combine nerve block reduce pain reduces opioid consumption thus reduce side effect nausea , vomit lethargy compare current treatment local infiltration analgesia . Background : Nerve block analgesic treatment orthopedic surgery recognize proven procedure . The nerve block disadvantage anesthetize sensory nerve fiber also nerve fiber muscle leg . The Saphenous nerve block cause stun sensory nerve knee region . The Obturator nerve block cause stun sensory nerve knee region thighs inward leading muscle , affect patient 's mobilization capacity . Both block know good addition analgesic treatment . Ropivacaine well-known local anesthetic . Adrenaline also use study , addition local anesthetic agent , show prolong effect nerve block . Saphenous Obturator nerve block four drug Ropivacaine Adrenaline combine high dose systemic Dexamethasone systematically investigate knee replacement surgery , know whether method provide good pain treatment . Method The patient receive one two treatment , determine randomly : - A. Saphenous Obturator nerve block active anesthetic ( Ropivacaine , Adrenaline ) combine systemic ketoroloc high dose Dexamethasone local infiltration around knee joint placebo medicine ( normal saline ) . - B . Both block placebo medicine ( normal saline ) local infiltration around knee joint activ local anesthetic . Neither patient , investigator staff around patient knowledge treatment patient receive . The block place operation local infiltration around knee joint give surgeon operation .</brief_summary>
