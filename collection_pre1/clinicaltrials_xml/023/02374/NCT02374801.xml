	<detailed_description>Since introduction cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) large scale , observe approximately 30 % recipient patient non-responsive therapy . This non-responsiveness decreased optimize device programming , particularly stimulation rate , pace sense atrioventricular ( AV ) delay , interventricular ( VV ) delay . All CRT patient need 100 % rate ventricular capture , beyond achievement therapy effectiveness require identification optimal pacing configuration , varies among patient . The optimization CRT system , usually base ultrasound image time-consuming number patient need multiple optimization procedure due ventricular remodel grow rapidly . The mechanical effect coordinate contraction result shorten isovolumetric contraction phase pre-ejection time , increase LV dP/dt ( change leave ventricular pressure time . The concept measure contractility implantable accelerometer first clinically validate multicenter study rate responsive pacing system ( BEST - Living SORIN Biomedica ) 1996 . This study positively demonstrate measurement Peak Endocardial Acceleration signal ( call PEA SonR ) feasible reliable long-term , purpose rate response hemodynamic monitor cardiac function . More recent clinical study demonstrate optimal VV AV Delays determine use algorithm base SonR signal analysis ( SonR method ) correlate high hemodynamic improvement lead significant clinical benefit patient , thus reduce rate non-responsiveness CRT therapy . Therefore , frequent automatic AV VV delay optimization patient CRT-D device could benefit patient , increase percent CRT responder , clinician , simplify CRT optimization . The inclusion phase `` Clinical Trial SonRtip Lead Automatic AV-VV Optimization Algorithm PARADYM RF SonR CRT-D '' ( RESPOND CRT Study , code ITSY06 ) complete . A total 1039 patient enrol 125 center Europe , Australia USA , 13 January 2012 14 October 2014 . Safety monitor continuously throughout RESPOND-CRT trial Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . The DSMB charter provide recommendation Sponsor suspend stop study clear evidence harm harmful side-effects relate use device study procedure . To date , safety concern raise RESPOND-CRT study data DSMB recommend continuation clinical study . Additionally , safety support European marketing history . As SonR System CE mark , RESPONDCRT conduct post-market study Europe . Therefore addition 1000+ patient enrol RESPOND-CRT IDE , additional 3000+ patient receive SonR system outside study . As supplement RESPOND CRT IDE Study Continued Access Study ( CAS ) conduct accord potential public health need preliminary evidence device likely effective significant safety concern propose indication .</detailed_description>
