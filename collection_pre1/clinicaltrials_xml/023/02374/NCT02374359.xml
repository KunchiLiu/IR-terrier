	<brief_summary>There information association supraventricular arrhythmia different atrial fibrillation ( AF ) atrial Flutter risk stroke . In study investigator hypothesize presence atrial tachycardia would lead atrial fibrillation recurrent stroke patient hospitalize cryptogenic stroke . The investigator study association atrial tachycardia ( AT ) , define four consecutive premature atrial beat , AF , recurrent stroke cardiovascular mortality 192 consecutive patient hospitalize cryptogenic stroke . The follow-up 12 month population</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atrial Tachycardia Predictor Atrial Fibrillation , Stroke Mortality Cryptogenic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator review consecutive patient hospitalize stroke hospital ( Neurology department ) January 2010 September 2013 , diagnosis cryptogenic stroke discharge . All patient routinely underwent 24-hour ECG record echocardiography hospitalization . The investigator global population 210 patient meet characteristic . The investigator analyze presence atrial tachycardia 24-hour ECG register patient cryptogenic stroke . The investigator consider atrial tachycardia four consecutive atrial ectopic beat . The investigator analyze baseline characteristic ( cardiovascular risk factor , renal function , leave atrial size _measured M mode echocardiography long paraesternal axis_ total number premature atrial complex 24-hour ECG monitoring . The patient stratify accord presence absence atrial tachycardia 24-hour ECG data . The investigator follow clinical event ( AF , recurrent stroke death ) patient electronical medical data general physician re-hospitalizations recurrent ictus hospital ( reference hospital zone ) mortality 12 month .</detailed_description>
