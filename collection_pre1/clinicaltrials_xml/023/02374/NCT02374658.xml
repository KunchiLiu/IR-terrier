Given complexity ARTS-REHAB Project , study conduct two phase : Phase 1 ( complete ) 8-week pilot study , conduct West Park Healthcare Centre Bridgepoint Active Healthcare July October 2014 . This pilot evaluate strictly operational feasibility implement art program collect data slow-stream rehabilitation patient population . Phase 2 expands learn pilot study involve two-and-a-half-year Random Control Trial ( RTC ) study total 8 hospital ( include St. Peter 's Hospital Hamilton , four Toronto hospital , 3 hospital across province ) . Unlike pilot study feasibility , focus two-and-a-half-year study research measure personal social wellness describe . As extension grow literature art healthcare , propose research contribute knowledge transformative potential creative art program / intervention healthcare setting . Perceptual psychologist Rudolph Arnheim write , `` demonstrating distressed , art remind u mean everybody '' ( Arnheim,1986 , p. 257 ) . Arnheim 's observation aptly capture spirit literature contribution creative art health individual illness disability ( Daykin , Byrne , Soteriou , &amp; Sullivan-Marx , 2006 review ; McNiff , 2009 ; Malchiodi , ed. , 2000 ; Moon , 2008 ) . However , much literature focus specific art form medical therapy specific illness ( e.g. , dementia , schizophrenia ) specific demographic ( senior , child ) . There appear need study examine broadly engagement creative process serf whole person strictly disability recovery / treatment . The ARTS-REHAB Project Research Study take approach explore recovery term patient ' physical need , also term emotional psychological need heal return daily life community . Given `` whole person '' approach study , degree patient 's engagement recovery must consider . A diverse literature patient motivation compliance show patient engagement play role determine success treatment ( O'Gorman , 1975 ; Meichenbaum &amp; Turk , 1987 review ; McClean &amp; Pound , 2000 ; Skolasky , et al. , 2008 ) .

A third body literature relevant study explore psycho-social indicator wellbeing illness/recovery . Within broad literature , concept optimism emerges play important role cop stressful life event . Optimism characterize orientation toward future positive explanation offer even negative outcome . Simply put , general expectation good rather bad happen ( Sheier &amp; Carver , 1985 ) . According literature , optimism associate improved quality life form low anxiety/depression cancer patient ( Carver , Pozo , Harris , 1993 ; Applebaum et al , 2014 ) patient traumatic brain injury ( Peleg , et al. , 2009 ) , great satisfaction treatment regime patient suffer myocardial infarction ( Barry , et al. , 2007 ) , low suicidal ideation university student ( Range &amp; Penton , 1994 ) . Much optimism literature , however , tend focus patient traumatic chronic illness mental illness ( Eisner , et al. , 2009 ; Johnson , et al. , 2009 ) . There room build evidence different patient population , namely , patient undergo physical rehabilitation . Furthermore , room explore optimism context specifically arts-based intervention , prescribe medical treatment . For past ten year , Living Through Arts program successfully serve different demographic community ( e.g . senior dementia , homeless low income individual , people mental illnesses intellectual disability ) across Ontario .

More specifically , curriculum ARTS-REHAB Project arts program consist theme health , recovery , new identity enable patient create new story , shape sense purpose , generate positive image future . The expect outcome participant arts program study include generate : great increase optimism recovery ; positive outlook future ; short length stay hospital compare patient involved art program .</detailed_description>
