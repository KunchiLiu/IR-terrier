	<brief_summary>Sarcopenia represent loss skeletal muscle strength occur age . It major component frailty effect daily functioning , fall , fracture well document . Along population age worldwide , number people sarcopenia expect increase , thus , contribute dependency anticipated increase health social care cost . The cause sarcopenia multifactorial . Recent evidence suggest reversibility exists , highlight importance intervention modality . However , role nutritional supplementation exercise program , either individually combination , still uncertain , randomize control trial ( RCTs ) recommend International Sarcopenia Initiative . Therefore , investigator plan conduct 24-month RCT compare effectiveness 12-week exercise program alone , combined exercise program nutrition supplement , non-exercise control group improve muscle mass , strength power physical performance Chinese old people sarcopenia define use Asian Working Group Criteria ( AWGC ) . The investigator hypothesize compare non-exercise control group , improvement muscle strength , power mass , physical performance exercise alone group , additive effect combine exercise nutrition supplement group . Chinese old people age 65 year recruit brief screen sarcopenia cognitive status . Potential subject undertake detailed body composition biochemical measurement check eligibility . Eligible subject randomize one three group : exercise program alone , combined exercise program nutrition supplement , waitlist control group exercise program offer 24-week study enrollment . Each group 45 subject . Outcome measurement include muscle strength , power mass , physical performance , instrumental activity daily live related biochemical measurement make baseline , 12 24 week .</brief_summary>
