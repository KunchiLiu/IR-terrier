	<criteria>Male female subject document CD19+ B cell malignancy available curative treatment option ( autologous allogeneic SCT ) limit prognosis ( several month &lt; 2 year survival ) currently available therapy enrol : 1 . Eligible disease : CD19+ leukemia lymphoma . In general , patient : 1 . ALL without curative option therapy , include eligible allogeneic SCT . Patient may complete response , patient may active disease respond stable recent therapy.The intent enroll patient degree disease control rapidly increase disease burden enrollment cell infusion . 2 . Diffuse large cell lymphoma highgrade NHL , previously identify CD19+ include residual disease primary therapy eligible autologous SCT ; relapse prior autologous SCT ; beyond 1st CR relapse persistent disease eligible appropriate conventional allogeneic autologous SCT . 2 . Patients previously treat B cell direct engineer cell therapy eligible meet one follow criterion : 1. partial response response prior cell therapy 2. relapse prior cell therapy 3. demonstrate B cell recovery suggest loss engineer cell . 3 . Documented CD19 expression ( previous B cell direct cell therapy , applicable ) 4 . Age 1 24 year 5 . Expected survival &gt; 12 week 6 . Creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dl less 2.5x normal age 7 . Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl 8 . Adequate pulmonary function define &lt; Grade 3 hypoxia 9 . Adequate cardiac function define LVSF ≥ 28 % confirm ECHO 10 . Adequate performance status ( Lansky Karnofsky score ≥50 ) 11 . Patients relapse disease prior allogeneic SCT ( myeloablative nonmyeloablative ) eligible meet inclusion criterion 1 . Have active GVHD require immunosuppression 2 . Are 4 month transplant ( 6 month infusion ) 12 . Patients CNS3 disease eligible CNS disease responsive therapy 13 . For patient require leukapheresis T cell collection ( i.e . previously collect product exists ) , adequate venous access apheresis eligible appropriate catheter placement , contraindication leukapheresis . 14 . Voluntary inform consent give . 1 . Pregnant lactating woman . The safety therapy unborn child know . Female study participant reproductive potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test perform within 48 hour infusion . 2 . Uncontrolled active infection . 3 . Active hepatitis B hepatitis C infection . 4 . Concurrent use systemic steroid time cell infusion cell collection , condition , treat physician 's opinion , likely require steroid therapy collection infusion . Steroids disease treatment time cell collection time infusion permit . Use physiologic replacement hydrocortisone inhale steroid permit well . 5 . Presence grade 24 acute extensive chronic GVHD . 6 . Under treatment GVHD . 7 . CNS3 disease progressive therapy , CNS parenchymal lesion might increase risk CNS toxicity 8 . Any uncontrolled active medical disorder would preclude participation outline . 9 . HIV infection</criteria>
