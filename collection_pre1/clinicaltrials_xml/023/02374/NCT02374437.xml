	<detailed_description>This single-site , randomize , partly double-blind , placebo-controlled study Aramchol sixty six ( 66 ) healthy male volunteer . In part study subject enrol study within 28 day drug administration ( ) . The study consist three part subject assign three Parts follow : Part A - single escalating dos : The purpose part evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability Aramchol tablets single dos either 200 mg 400 mg. Twelve ( 12 ) subject randomize receive , follow overnight 10 hour fast , single dose either : - Administration A : 1×200 mg Aramchol tablet ( 6 subject ) - Administration B : 1×400 mg Aramchol tablet ( 6 subject ) Subjects admit Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) even study drug administration ( Day 0 ) remain in-house 36 hour dose . Blood sample Aramchol concentration draw 36 hour designate time point describe . Additional ambulatory sample collect 48 , 72 , 96 144 hour post-dose . Subjects continuously monitor safety . An End-of Study/Safety Follow-up visit take place last PK sample day , i.e . 144 hour post-dose . Part B - food effect : The purpose part evaluate effect high fat high calorie meal pharmacokinetics single dose Aramchol ass safety tolerability single 600 mg dose . This part design randomize , two period crossover food-effect study . Eighteen ( 18 ) subject randomize receive one two administration sequence ( C-D D-C ) follow : - Administration C : 1×200 mg +1×400 mg Aramchol tablets fasting condition ( fast least 10 hour 4 hour dose ) - Administration D : 1×200 mg +1×400 mg Aramchol tablets feed condition ( fast least 10 hour dose , consumption high calorie high fat meal within 30 minute prior drug administration food additional 4 hour dose ) In period part , subject admit Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) even study drug administration ( Day 0 ) remain in-house 36 hour dose . Blood Aramchol concentration draw 36 hour designate time point describe . Additional ambulatory sample collect 48 , 72 , 96 144 hour post-dose . Subjects continuously monitor safety . There wash-out period least 14 day dose session . An End-of Study/Safety Follow-up visit take place last PK sample day second dosing period , i.e . 144 hour second dose . The PK profile subject receive administration C ( i.e . 600 mg Aramchol tablet fast condition ) compare subject receive 200 400 mg Aramchol tablet fast condition Part A . Part C - multiple dos : The purpose part evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability Aramchol tablets multiple administration 3 different dos . This part design randomize , double blind , double-dummy , placebo-controlled multiple-dose study . Thirty six ( 36 ) subject participate part equally randomize receive either 200 mg , 400 mg , 600 mg placebo tablet ten consecutive day . Drug administration precede light breakfast consume within 1 hour prior dose ( composition describe Appendix III ) . All drug administer study staff except Dose No . 6 subject take home . In order maintain blinding , subject receive two tablet dose , accord follow administration : - Administration E : 1×200 mg Aramchol tablet + 1×400 mg Placebo tablet - Administration F : 1×200 mg Placebo tablet + 1×400 mg Aramchol tablet - Administration G : 1×200 mg Aramchol tablet + 1×400 mg Aramchol tablet - Administration H : 1×200 mg Placebo tablet + 1×400 mg Placebo tablet Treatment assignment follow : Subjects admit Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) even first study drug administration ( Day 0 ) remain in-house 24 36 hour first ( Day 1 ) last ( Day 10 ) dos , respectively . PK blood sample draw Day 1 24 hour designate time point describe . Additionally , ambulatory pre-dose ( trough ) sample draw dose Days 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 . On Day 10 blood sample collect 36 hour designate time point describe additional ambulatory visit 48 , 96 , 120 , 144 , 168 192 hour post-dose . Subjects continuously monitor safety . An End-of Study/Safety Follow-up visit take place last PK sample day study , i.e . 144 hour ( Parts A B ) 192 hour ( Part C ) last dose administration .</detailed_description>
