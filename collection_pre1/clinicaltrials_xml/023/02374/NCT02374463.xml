	<brief_summary>Falls dangerous lead injury even death . The VA make fall prevention priority , effective program reduce fall 30 % . Tai Chi , stand exercise program , effective improve balance may prevent fall . Most fall occur walk individual experience slip trip . Programs focus walk , step , recovery slip may effective fall reduction . This study compare Tai Chi novel multimodal balance intervention ( MMBI ) . MMBI focus stand balance , walk , step , strength training , recovery slip . The Investigators believe MMBI program effective Tai Chi improve balance prevent fall old Veterans Investigators use result study develop large study fall prevention old Veterans .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Balance Mobility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Falls currently lead cause injurious death non-fatal injury adult age 65 . Older Veterans may great risk fall due high burden medical co-morbidity . The VA make research fall prevention high priority . Falls complex numerous deficit include impaired balance , decreased postural control , muscle weakness , inability successfully negotiate environmental hazard . Tai Chi currently consider one effective fall prevention exercise intervention , endorsement Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) widely influence health care policy . However , study compare Tai Chi another active intervention . Tai Chi may generally improve balance , decrease fall risk , provide general low body strengthen . However , Tai Chi may sufficiently improve gait dynamic mobility little target obstacle negotiation , one large contributor fall . The majority fall occur walking , slip trip common cause targeted intervention focus improve step walk ability may even effective improve balance reduce fall . The Investigators plan enroll 56 old ( age &gt; 65 year ) community dwell Veterans history fall last year high risk recurrent fall . After baseline test participant randomize either MMBI Tai Chi intervention model Tai Chi Moving Better Balance Program . All participant participate group exercise class assign intervention 1 hour , 3 time per week 24 week . After completion 24 week exercise group change compare 1 ) balance ( 4-square step test ) , 2 ) mobility fall risk ( functional gait assessment , clinical gait assessment gait variability GAITrite ) , 4 ) questionnaire ( fall efficacy ABC ) 5 ) low extremity isometric strength testing ( biodex ) , 6 ) whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) CT scan abdomen , hip thighs determination low extremity core muscle composition . The investigator also plan follow participant 6 month completion intervention examine difference fall rate cessation program group . Impact : This research directly benefit Veterans may lead new effective intervention could reduce fall risk , injury-related hospitalization death old Veterans . MMBI also readily exportable community minimal resource could widely implement VAs part standard care , similar MOVE ! . Results SPIRE grant use power large randomized clinical trial examine effectiveness two intervention reduce rate fall risk fall old Veterans high risk fall .</detailed_description>
