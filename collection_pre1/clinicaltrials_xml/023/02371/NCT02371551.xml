	<brief_summary>The primary concern complex renal cyst ( CRC ) malignant potential accurate diagnosis characterization . Patients CRC undergo frequent image surveillance ( every 6-12 Mo ) , progression suggest neoplastic process . The gold standard establish diagnosis necessity surgical intervention ( i.e . partial nephrectomy ) conventional computer tomography ( CT ) imaging . Its main drawback radiation dose body intravenous contrast medium administration , risk nephrotoxicity . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) special functional sequence ( fMRI ) contrast-enhanced ultrasonography ( CEUS ) allow measure tissue blood flow perfusion characteristic without ionize radiation nephrotoxic contrast medium . To compare diagnostic accuracy , sensitivity specificity CEUS/functional MRI versus gold standard CT , 60 patient CRC evaluate use 3 modality . The main hypothesis fMRI CEUS equal accuracy CT regard diagnosis classification CRC lesion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Complex Renal Cyst With CEUS/Functional MRI Versus CT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Renal cyst occur variety disease also normal kidney ( i.e . simple cyst ) . Diagnostic imaging play central role diagnosis renal cyst lesion . Most patient diagnose undergoing imaging ( compute tomography [ CT ] , magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] , ultrasound [ US ] ) unrelated reason increase incidental finding last decade parallel grow use imaging procedure . Simple renal cyst commonly observe normal kidney limit clinical relevance . The primary clinical concern accurate evaluation complex renal cyst ( CRC ) malignant potential . Based upon initial radiographic evaluation , study may require , complex lesion may require surgical excision exact diagnosis , base growth follow . The gold standard diagnosis CRC conventional CT imaging . Its main drawback radiation dose body intravenous contrast medium administration , risk nephrotoxicity . In order accurate classify manage lesion , Bosniak renal cyst classification system create . Based upon morphologic enhancement characteristic CT scan , cystic renal mass place one five category ( I , II , IIF , III , IV ) . Although yet validate reader agreement generalizability , Bosniak renal cyst classification system widely accept urologists radiologist best way ass follow CRC lesion . While Bosniak classification base CT finding , approach applicable useful predefined framework evaluation CRC radiographic modality i.e . MRI conventional contrast-enhanced ultrasound . The ability differentiate benign versus malignant ( surgical versus nonsurgical mass ) still represent major challenge . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) gain immense popularity last decade allow generation high-resolution image , include 3D reconstruction , without ionize radiation . Functional MRI perform without injection contrast , thus avoid risk nephrogenic systemic sclerosis patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . Diffusion weight image ( DW-MRI ) , blood-oxygen-level-dependent ( BOLD ) MRI arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) sequence functional sequence perform without injection contrast . The recent development availability contrast-enhanced ultrasonography ( CEUS ) use microbubbles improve sensitivity diagnostic confidence respect conventional colour-Doppler US . They allow vascular bed opacification open way detect microcirculation . CEUS able detect change human renal cortical microcirculation . Thus seem feasible technique evaluate ( i.e . perfusion pattern cyst wall perfusion septum ) CRC use Bosniak classification system . Ideally , method evaluation CRC safe , non-invasive , accurate . Abdominal CT scan delivers significant ionize radiation , may consideration young patient ( age &lt; 35 year ) , utilizes contrast medium considerable nephrotoxicity risk allergic reaction . No prospective study compare CT CEUS functional MRI evaluation CRC conduct . Objective The primary aim study evaluate diagnostic accuracy , sensitivity specificity CEUS/fMRI compare abdominal CT current gold standard diagnostic modality . Methods Prospective , single center , observational setting . Patients CRC fulfill inclusion criterion evaluate write informed consent . Kidney function CRC progression follow accord current medical standard . If significant change cystic lesion observe , evaluation surgical intervention , indicate , initiated primary physician charge . Testing perform upon study entry 12 month accord follow schedule : - Blood-sampling - CT - fMRI - renal CEUS - chart review Two study physician independently review CEUS functional MRI image patient . The reviewer aware study design blind clinical information CT finding . The scoring system image interpretation base Bosniak cyst classification .</detailed_description>
