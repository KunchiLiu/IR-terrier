	<brief_summary>This study two-part open-label , single oral dose , two-way crossover study design . Part A Part B study independent may conduct parallel . The Part A study ass effect oral dose GSK1278863 pharmacokinetics CYP2C8 ( pioglitazone ) OATP1B1 ( rosuvastatin ) probe substrate order determine potential clinically-significant drug interaction CYP2C8 OATP1B1 substrates . The Part B study ass effect weak CYP2C8 inhibitor ( trimethoprim ) pharmacokinetics GSK1278863 six predominant metabolite . Part A conducted approximately 30 healthy subject , randomize study design . There approximate 7-day washout period dose period . Part B conduct approximately 20 healthy subject , single sequence study design . Follow conduct within 7 10 day last dose Part A B . The total duration subject 's involvement part A study approximately 8 week ( Screening Follow-up ) part B approximately 7 week ( Screening Follow-up ) .</brief_summary>
