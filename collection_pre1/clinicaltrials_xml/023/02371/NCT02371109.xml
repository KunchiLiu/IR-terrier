	<brief_summary>Routine screening gonorrhoea chlamydia involve urine sample male selftaken vulvovaginal swab ( VVSs ) females . As well infect urethra ( pee tube ) cervix ( neck womb ) , gonorrhoea chlamydia may also infect rectum ( bottom ) throat ( call extragenital site ) , often symptom . In people infection found one site , others one , anatomical site test infection miss . In certain woman one third infection may miss , men sex men ( MSM ) 90 % may miss , extragenital swab take . Currently , routine community test include extragenital site . Until recently sample could easily take outside clinical setting ( hospital , clinic surgery ) , new DNA test gonorrhoea , call NAATs , make possible . However , expensive , take sample extragenital site would treble cost . We propose swabs three site per person pool analyse together rather test separately . This method would identify whether person infection anatomical siteÍ¾ would alter management individual . Swabs rectum throat historically take clinician ( doctor nurse ) . The main attraction community screen client lead use selftaken sample . Recent study suggest selftaken swabs rectum throat acceptable client may good swab take clinician , costeffectiveness approach investigate . Our aim establish whether MSM females selftaken sample pool processed NAATs effective individual test take clinician .</brief_summary>
