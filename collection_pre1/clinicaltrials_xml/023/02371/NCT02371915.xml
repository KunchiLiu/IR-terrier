Part B : Randomized Controlled Rheumatoid Arthritis Care Delivery Model Trial Randomization : Participating patient randomly allocate two arm , either follow telehealth/videoconferencing near home community continue travel Saskatoon rheumatology clinic . Intervention : One study arm follow traditional rheumatology clinic ( in-person examine rheumatologist ) . The second study arm follow telehealth/videoconferencing . Patients telehealth/videoconferencing arm examine rural-based physical therapist report exam finding telehealth review urban-based rheumatologist . Follow-up visit every three month arm . All patient complete standardize history/data-collection form . Patients follow respective study arm nine month , evaluate in-person rheumatology clinic final face-to-face disease activity evaluation .</detailed_description>
