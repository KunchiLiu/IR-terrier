	<brief_summary>The purpose study advance effort develop personalized pharmacotherapy alcohol use disorder ( AUDs ) . The investigator propose conduct 12-week , prospective , randomized clinical trial moderate effect rs2832407 efficacy TOP reducing heavy drinking ( HD ) 200 individual European descent DSM-5 AUD . The investigator stratify randomization genotype oversample rs2832407*C homozygote , TOP-responsive genotype , ensure comparable number patient four medication x genotype group . The investigator use daily data collection examine change relevant process variable ( e.g. , alcohol expectancy ) interaction genotype medication group predictor HD . The propose study innovative first prospective test pharmacogenetic hypothesis involve TOP ; use daily report examine expectancy interact medication genotype predict HD ; enroll DSM-5 AUD patient whose goal either reduce stop drinking , increase study 's external validity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Double-blind Placebo-Controlled Pharmacogenetic Study Topiramate European-American Heavy Drinkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 12-week , prospective , randomized clinical trial moderate effect rs2832407 efficacy topiramate reduce HD 200 individual European descent DSM-5 AUD . The investigator stratify randomization genotype oversample rs2832407*C homozygote , topiramate-responsive genotype , ensure comparable number subject four medication x genotype group . The investigator compare efficacy topiramate placebo reduce frequency HDDs subject AUD use two-arm , parallel-groups design . Subjects either goal reduce drink safe level abstinence . The investigator use daily data collection examine change relevant process variable interaction genotype medication group predictor HD . At visit , subject receive Medication Management ( Pettinati , Weiss et al . 2004 ) , develop COMBINE Trial investigator modify relevant reduce heavy drinking promote abstinence . Random assignment treatment group double-blind condition maintain throughout study . Raters train reliable use assessment . The investigator use serum GGTP percent disialotransferrin ( % dCDT ) , improve assay carbohydrate deficient transferrin , validate subject report . Following one-week pre-treatment assessment period , subject receive 12 week treatment , 6-day taper period , subject reduce dosage topiramate gradually discontinue completely . Daily report treatment period obtain use interactive voice response ( IVR ) identify subjective correlate medication effect monitor medication use . Following 12-week treatment period , subject ask return clinic 3-month 6-month post-treatment follow-up visit evaluate durability treatment effect . Two hundred men woman European descent randomize study medication . Subjects recruit use referral treatment program throughout Philadelphia ; IRB-approved advertisement mass transit , local radio television station newspaper , social medium , broadcast email message institution offer service posting/distributing recruitment material community college setting . Respondents initially evaluate telephone prior in-person visit Treatment Research Center University Pennsylvania Perelman School Medicine . The investigator select subject base genotype ensure comparable number individual rs2832407*C-allele homozygote A-allele carrier . The investigator block randomize subject balance group treatment goal ( i.e. , reduce drink abstinence ) .</detailed_description>
