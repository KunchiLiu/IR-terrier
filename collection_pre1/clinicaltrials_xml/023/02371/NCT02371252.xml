	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis common disease define decrease bone mass strength increase risk fragility fracture . This disorder may affect health many adult cause disability , morbidity , mortality . Current first-line medical therapy bisphosphonates alendronate one widely use . However , expenditure medicine one major problem inadequate access treatment . The investigator hypothesize generic alendronate clinical efficacy brand formulation . Therefore , result study extremely crucial . If adequate efficacy generic alendronate could establish affords safety profile brand alendronate , use generic alendronate could recommend .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Brand Versus Generic Alendronate Osteoporosis Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis common disease estimate 200 million people worldwide suffer . The prevalence continue escalate increasingly elderly population . The risk fragility fracture elder age 50 approximately 50 % woman 20 % men . Current first-line medical therapy bisphosphonates alendronate one widely use . However , expenditure medicine one major problem inadequate access treatment . Generally , insurances health care provider prefer physician prescribe generic instead brand drug , due low cost . However , clinical information bone mineral density ( BMD ) , fracture reduction side effect new generic alendronate limit . The objective study evaluate efficacy safety new generic alendronate ( Bonmax® ) compare brand alendronate ( Fosamax® ) . The efficacy generic alendronate determine measure percent change bone mineral density lumbar spine total hip 1 year treatment comparing change brand alendronate group .</detailed_description>
