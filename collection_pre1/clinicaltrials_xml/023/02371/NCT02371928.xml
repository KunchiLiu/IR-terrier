	<brief_summary>This study design investigate efficacy safety supervise neuromuscular exercise program versus standard home exercise program patient post-traumatic symptomatic anterior shoulder instability . Participants least one week symptom duration randomly assign either 12-week structured , supervised Shoulder Instability Neuromuscular EXercise ( SINEX ) program versus standard HOMe EXercise ( HOMEX ) program . The H1-hypothesis SINEX program result great increase quality life physical function HOMEX program primary endpoint three month follow-up baseline</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Neuromuscular Exercise Program Patients With Anterior Shoulder Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A common , painful , injury individual second third decade traumatic dislocate shoulder . This injury account almost 50 % joint dislocation register emergency department . Due post-traumatic laxity injury surround shoulder tissue , one major problem risk develop chronic recurrent instable shoulder affect patient physically psychologically decrease overall quality life . Biomechanically , proprioceptive change decrease sensorimotor control find patient post-traumatic shoulder instability inhibit ability control stabilize glenohumeral joint . In similar musculoskeletal disorder , recent study clearly show positive effect progressive neuromuscular exercise . Finally , study yet investigate effect structure , physical exercise-training regime base neuromuscular principle target shoulder joint . This trial perform randomize , assessor-blinded , control multi-center trial cooperation various shoulder outpatient clinic locate different hospital The Region Southern Northern Denmark .</detailed_description>
