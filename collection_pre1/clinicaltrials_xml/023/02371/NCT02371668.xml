	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers want see new drug reduces flu disease people treat drug versus placebo . The drug antibody may help immune system fight flu . Placebo sugar water . All participant get flu virus . They may may develop flu symptom . Objective : - To see drug CR6261 reduce flu disease people treat drug versus placebo . Eligibility : - Healthy nonsmoker age 18 45 . Design : - Participants screen separate protocol . - Participants must use contraception abstinence several week study . They must alcohol 1 day visit . Any medicine must approve study doctor follow-up . - Participants stay hospital isolation unit least 10 day . - They : - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood urine test - Heart lung test - Tests drug alcohol - Throughout stay , participant : - Be closely watched medical team - Have nasal wash swab several time day - Participants flu virus spray nostril . - The next day , participant get either study drug placebo soft plastic tube place vein needle . It take 2 hour . They know get . - Participants go home 10 day test negative flu 2 day row . - Participants daily questionnaires home 2 follow-up visit 2 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Healthy Volunteers Evaluate Efficacy Safety CR6261 H1N1 Influenza Healthy Human Challenge Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The high morbidity mortality associate pandemic seasonal influenza threat new potentially pandemic strain emerge make influenza important infectious disease public health problem . Mean annual estimate influenza death due seasonal influenza alone attribute 49,000 death US 250,000 500,000 death industrialized country influenza . Pandemics even devastate effect . Public health agency must continue prepared make attempt reduce public health impact important virus . In realm influenza therapeutic , antiviral drug currently use treat influenza infection fail protect current vaccine receive vaccine . Currently , two class antiviral FDA approve treatment influenza A : neuraminidase inhibitor matrix M2 channel blocker . Although drug show effective reduce influenza illness 24-48 hour reduce shed relatively healthy adult , vaccination , limited effectiveness high risk group severe complicate influenza infection . In addition , antiviral resistance become common human influenza A virus , currently circulate H1N1 H3N2 strain resistant adamantane M2 channel blocker many case neuraminidase inhibitor resistance also report strain subtypes . This resistance develop quickly case require single amino acid change . Given significant issue currently available treatment , novel therapy influenza clearly need . Live virus challenge study play pivotal role develop influenza therapeutic past , instrumental future . No novel therapeutic prophylactic agent FDA-approved since last influenza challenge study cease decade ago . In collaboration Crucell Vaccine Institute ( part Crucell Janssen family Pharmaceutical Companies Johnson &amp; Johnson ) protocol evaluate mAb CR6261 possible therapeutic value . Unlike current antiviral compound interfere portion viral replicative cycle , agent mAb target stem HA , neutralize virus stabilize pre-fusion state prevent pH-dependent fusion viral cellular membrane . Pre-clinical data suggest mAb good cross-protective efficacy variety HA subtypes unlike current vaccine , make potentially effective event emerge influenza virus outbreak novel HA subtype . In addition , conserve nature HA stem region suggest amino acid change confer resistance much less likely . We effort demonstrate CR6261 lead improve outcome compare placebo respect AUC virus shed determine qPCR NP swab treat subject .</detailed_description>
