	<brief_summary>To pursue objective , measure uric acid baseline post 14 day twice daily allopurinol therapy 30 Hmong participant document gout hyperuricemia know genotype key renal transporter uric acid .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetics Hyperuricemia Therapy Hmong</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Minnesota Hmong unique population individual South East Asian descent note high prevalence gout gout related comorbidities compare non-Hmong . Elevated level uric acid think root cause gout . Elevated level serum uric acid result either overproduction under-excretion . Xanthine oxidase play key role breakdown purine form uric acid . Transporters kidney also play key role excretion and/or re-absorption uric acid . The objective study explore whether genetic variation renal transporter may influence disposition serum uric acid response drug ( allopurinol ) well disposition active metabolite ( oxipurinol ) may also substrate transporter responsible uric acid disposition . Genetic variation unique Hmong population may explain increased prevalence gout perceive lack responsiveness drug ( allopurinol ) use treat condition .</detailed_description>
