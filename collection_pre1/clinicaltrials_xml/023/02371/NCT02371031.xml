	<criteria>Known suspected diagnosis intracranial glioma substantial nonenhancing region assess contrast enhance MRI . For purpose study , gliomas substantial nonenhancing region define contrastenhancing volumes less 50 % total estimated tumor volume . Gliomas contrastenhancing region eligible study . Standard care surgical resection and/or stereotactic biopsy brain tumor plan within 2 week FDOPAPET/MRI study . At least 18 year age . Measurable disease MRI define tumor measure least 1 cm two perpendicular dimension . Karnofsky performance &gt; 50 correspond ECOG category 0 , 1 , 2 . Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose assess performance score . Creatinine clearance radioisotope glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &gt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 Patient legally authorize representative must able understand willing sign write informed consent document . Patients undergo PET/MRI : contraindication gadolinium contrast enhance brain MRI ( i.e. , allergy gadolinium contrast , MRIincompatible implantable device , GFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 , severe claustrophobia ) . At discretion responsible physician , FDOPAPET/CT may perform PET/MRI contraindicate unavailable . If FDOPAPET/CT perform , patient must undergo contrastenhanced MRI fusion FDOPAPET 4 week FDOPAPET/CT . Prior chemotherapy radiation therapy brain tumor . Prior biopsy surgical resection glioma without additional therapy exclusion criterion . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Women childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test 3 day prior FDOPA injection .</criteria>
