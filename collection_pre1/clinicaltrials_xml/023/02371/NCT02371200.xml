	<detailed_description>This study `` A Pivotal , Phase III Trial Detecting generalize tonic-clonic seizure Seizure Detection Warning System Epilepsy Patients `` phase III , pivotal , prospective study electromyography ( EMG ) base seizure detection warn system ( tentatively name Brain Sentinelâ„¢ Seizure Detection System ) detect generalize tonic-clonic ( GTC ) seizures . The detection device wear bicep brachii muscle intend alert remote caregiver GTC seizure provide record GTC seizure activity . This facilitate fast intervention GTC seizure , accurately document GTC seizure frequency home , skilled nursing , inpatient setting .</detailed_description>
