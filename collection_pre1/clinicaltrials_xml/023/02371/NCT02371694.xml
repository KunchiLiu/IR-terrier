	<brief_summary>Background : Based international evidence , current management people T1DM intensive insulin therapy ( IIT ) use algorithm base meal carbohydrate content ( MCC ) calculate prandial insulin dose . Typically , calculation take account protein fat content meal . There lack clinical advice optimal management high protein/fat meal due paucity evidence regard impact protein/fat glycaemic control . Objective : To determine mean glucose excursion fasting ( measure continuous glucose monitoring , CGMS ) 30 minute interval 8 hour postprandial period test condition . Protein effect look separate parallel study Australia . Hypothesis : The fat content meal cause dose-response change postprandial glucose concentration child T1DM . Research Design Methods : Randomised cross-over study involve thirty patient . Inclusion criterion : T1DM &gt; 1 year , age 8-18 year , HbA1c &lt; 8 % BMI &lt; 91st centile , intensive insulin therapy . Participants give test meal 6 consecutive night random order ; 4 test meal vary fat content , one 20g carbohydrate test meal zero fat give control meal . A CGMS use assess glucose response 5 minute interval 8 hour test meal consumption . The relationship fat load test meal mean change postprandial glucose concentration analyse describe . Conclusions : This study determine whether fat cause dose dependent response glucose concentration lead refine guideline possible adjustment insulin dos fat content meal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Aims project To determine postprandial glucose dose-response curve response vary fat amount study various parameter ( glycaemic excursion , rate glucose level increase , area curve , percent time target glucose range , maximal glucose excursion , time maximal glucose excursion time glucose level return fast concentration ) provide continuous glucose monitoring 6 day study period view provide data calculate accurate insulin dose schedule account vary dietary fat ingestion . Objective 1 To define impact vary quantity ( dose ) fat post-prandial glucose concentration i.e . determine relationship fat load test meal mean change postprandial glucose concentration . Objective 2 To compare impact vary fat quantity test meal control carbohydrate snack ( 20g ) without extra insulin . 2 . Protocol Participants contact daily one week prior study review overnight fast glucose concentration necessary , adjust insulin dos . The study carry week long period patient . Participants give test meal 6 consecutive day random order , 5 test meal vary lipid content one carbohydrate ( 20g ) test meal comparator . A continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) insert day first test meal remove completion sixth night . To define impact lipid post-prandial glucose concentration , participant consume standardise meal 18:00hours receive standard insulin bolus injection pump ( use standard wave bolus insulin pump ) base meal carbohydrate content . At 22:00 hour participant consume lipid test meal dose ( vary fat content 2.5 , 12.5 , 25 , 37.5 , 50g ) carbohydrate snack 20g . The calculation fat dos base Pankowska algorithm [ 3 ] recommend additional insulin every 100 kcal fat protein . There randomised order test meal . Test meal formulate palatable , consume within 5 minute contain negligible carbohydrate , protein fibre . A dietician design test meal conjunction co-investigator detail ensure ease formulation practical administration . The lipid dose test meal test acceptability palatability ensure adherence protocol . The order test meal types/carbohydrate snack random ( computer generate randomisation ) . The comparator 20g carbohydrate snack include assess participant 's typical glucose response 20g carbohydrate . No insulin give lipid carbohydrate snack . Participants fast breakfast . 3 . Outcomes Glucose concentration measure start test meal 5 minute interval 8 hour postprandial period . Therefore , data consist repeated measurement individual within test meal load well individual across test meal load . The primary outcome interest Area Under Curve ( AUC ) glucose concentration post prandial 8 hour . Linear regression , within generalise linear mixed model framework , use test dose response AUCs increase size fat mean .</detailed_description>
