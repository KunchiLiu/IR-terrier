	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) rare multisystem connective-tissue disorder characterize three major pathological hallmark : widespread fibrosis , vasculopathy immunological abnormality . As connective tissue affect , condition multiple effect orofacial region . Indeed , latter involve approximately 80 % SSc patient . Oral manifestation major impact quality life require specific treatment perform early possible . Widening periodontal ligament space , seem link increased collagen synthesis , one common dental radiographic finding . However , radiologic sign mostly study two-dimensional radiograph . The investigator recently describe patient suffer SSc existence calcification within periodontal ligament space use Cone Beam Computed Tomography ( CBCT ) approach ( Jung et al. , Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol 2013 ) . Such calcification , never observe , could part phenotypic spectrum disease , particular dystrophic calcinosis associate . They could furthermore constitute specific feature SSc . However , radiographic sign require investigate large number patient . Several cytokine implicate SSc pathogenesis . A recent study reveal elevate CXCL4 serum level correlate disease complication , suggest molecule could use prognostic biomarker . Increased IL-6 serum level also correlate SSc severity . Gingival crevicular fluid easily collect gingival crevice surround teeth constitute indicator local also systemic inflammation . Analysis gingival crevicular fluid cytokine profile could contribute identification specific SSc biomarkers allow good comprehension oral manifestation pathogenesis . The aim case-control study characterize precisely oral manifestation associate SSc within National Referral Center Rare Autoimmune Diseases ( Strasbourg , France ) patient cohort order identify specific radiological , clinical and/or biological sign . Some could correlate severity prognosis disease . To investigator knowledge first study use tridimensional CBCT approach .</brief_summary>
