	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 clinical study , aim evaluate effectiveness investigational drug PLX3397 treatment tumour pigment villonodular synovitis giant cell tumor tendon sheath subject , surgical removal tumour would cause harm good . The main purpose study gather information investigational drug PLX3397 , may help treat tumour . The study consist two part . In Part 1 , eligible study participant assign receive either PLX3397 match placebo 24 week . A number assessment carry course study , include physical examination , blood test , image study , electrocardiogram , questionnaire . MRI scan use evaluate response tumour treatment independently assess central reader blind treatment assignment . Those subject , whether assign PLX3397 match placebo , complete Part 1 ( i.e , complete 24 week dose Week 25 assessment ) eligible advance Part 2 , long-term treatment phase subject receive open-label PLX3397</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year . A diagnosis PVNS GCTTS ( ) histologically confirm either pathologist treat institution central pathologist , ( ii ) surgical resection would associate potentially worsen functional limitation severe morbidity ( locally advance disease ) , morbidity determine consensually qualify personnel ( eg , two surgeon multidisciplinary tumor board ) . Measurable disease least 2 cm otherwise base RECIST 1.1 , assess MRI scan central radiologist . Symptomatic disease Stable analgesic regimen 2 week prior randomization . During week prior randomization , least 4 day BPI Worst Pain NRS item Worst Stiffness NRS item complete correctly . Males females childbearing potential permit study long consent avoid get partner pregnant become pregnant , respectively , use highly effective contraception method , describe , throughout study 90 day completion . Highly effective method contraception include : hormonal method associate inhibition ovulation , intrauterine device ; surgical sterilization ( include partner 's vasectomy ) sexual abstinence . Women nonchildbearing potential may include either surgically sterile postmenopausal ≥1 year . Women documentation least 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level &gt; 40 milliinternational unit per milliliter ( mIU/mL ) consider postmenopausal . Adequate hematologic , hepatic , renal function , define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L Ratio concentration enzymes aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) blood ( AST/ALT ) ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL • Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN Platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L • Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN Willingness ability complete BPI Worst Pain NRS item , Worst Stiffness NRS item , PROMIS Physical Function Scale , selfassessment instrument throughout study . Willingness ability use electronic diary . Willingness ability provide write informed consent prior studyrelated procedure comply study requirement . Investigational drug use within 28 day randomization . Previous use PLX3397 biologic treatment target Colony Stimulating Factor 1 ( CSF1 ) Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor ( CSF1R ) ; previous use oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor , eg , imatinib nilotinib , allow . Active cancer ( either concurrent within last year start study treatment ) require nonsurgical therapy ( eg , chemotherapy radiation therapy ) , exception PVNS/GCTTS , surgically treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , melanoma insitu , carcinoma insitu cervix . Prostate breast cancer remission ( receive active therapy ) &gt; 5 year allow . Known metastatic PVNS/GCTTS . Active chronic infection hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) hepatitis B virus know active chronic infection human immunodeficiency virus . Known active tuberculosis . Significant concomitant arthropathy affect joint , serious illness , uncontrolled infection , medical psychiatric history , investigator 's opinion , would likely interfere person 's study participation interpretation result . Women breastfeed . A screening Fridericia correct QT interval ( QTcF ) ≥ 450 m ( men ) ≥ 470 m ( woman ) . MRI contraindication .</criteria>
