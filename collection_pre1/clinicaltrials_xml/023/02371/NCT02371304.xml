	<brief_summary>Current therapy early colorectal cancer radical Total Mesorectal Excision ( TME ) . Colorectal surgical resection accompany high morbidity 33 % 90 day mortality 9 % fragile elderly patient see result Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit ( DSCA ) 2013 . Additionally , rectal cancer surgery associate substantial loss health relate quality life due defecation disorder , incontinence , sexual dysfunction stoma relate morbidity . These disadvantage acceptable radical surgery option cure . Advances technology enable development local excision early rectal cancer precise endoluminal microsurgery local endoscopic excision result significant decrease short- long term morbidity . However current evidence inadequate quality conclude oncologic safety local treatment early rectal cancer . Imaging predict outcome tailor treatment advance cancer fails early cancer . Pathological assessment excise tumor tissue provide optimal information tumor stage , tumor characteristic tumor differentiation , thereby enable predict risk recurrence local treatment alone . For early rectal cancer , low risk recurrence base favourable tumor characteristic local excision see safe patient require additional treatment . However , patient early rectal cancer high risk recurrence base tumor characteristic consensus additional treatment local excision . According National guideline patient receive TME procedure . However , subgroup patient local treatment follow chemoradiotherapy might also oncological safe . Current evidence inadequate quality conclusive . For subgroup patient early rectal cancer high risk tumorcharacteristics TESAR trial design , patiens randomise local endoluminal excision additional TME-procedure ( standard ) adjuvant chemoradiotherapy . Primary endpoint study local recurrence 3 three year follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patient margin free ( least 1 mm ) endoluminal local excision ( TEM , TAMIS , TSPM , EMR/ESD polypectomy ) early rectal cancer ( 10 cm ) . 2 . Only lesion TME surgery indicate include ( If partial mesorectal excision ( PME ) indicate patient exclude ) . 3 . Pathological confirmation rectal adenocarcinoma fulfil follow criterion : T1 size 35 cm pT1 , maximum size 3 cm , least poor differentiation and/or lymphatic and/or venous invasion 4 . Pathological confirmation rectal adenocarcinoma fulfil follow criterion : pT2 , maximum size 3 cm , well differentiate without lymphatic venous invasion . 5 . Complete colonoscopy , without synchronous colorectal cancer 6. cN0 stage base pelvic MRI ; lymph node small 10 mm consider benign , independent morphologic feature . Staging do within 6 week randomisation . 7 . Adequate distant staging ( CTthorax abdomen ) without sign distant metastasis ( cM0 ) 8 . Male female , Age &gt; 18 year . 9 .
