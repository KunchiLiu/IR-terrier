	<brief_summary>Exercise frequently prescribe favorable lifestyle intervention prevent/reverse type 2 diabetes . It also prescribe addition concurrent pharmacological treatment , metformin . Recent data ( animal human ) suggest metformin may attenuate favorable benefit exercise training . In light physiological mechanism Dapagliflozin ( sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) inhibition ) , one might speculate rather inhibit , augment favorable adaptation exercise training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Dapagliflozin Augment The Favorable Adaptation To Endurance Exercise Training ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , placebo-controlled , double blind , repeat measure study . 30 sedentary adult recruit participation randomly assign one two 12-week treatment : 1 ) supervise endurance exercise train 4 day per week plus daily oral administration Dapagliflozin ; 2 ) supervise endurance exercise train 4 day per week plus daily oral administration placebo . Prior follow completion treatment follow dependent variable quantify : ) maximal aerobic capacity ; b ) substrate utilization standardize low-moderate intensity exercise ; c ) skeletal muscle aerobic enzyme activity ; ) body composition ; , e ) oral glucose tolerance , fast glucose insulin resistance . The dose Dapagliflozin begin 5 mg/day first 14-days . In absence complication , side effect , unfavorable reaction , dose increase 10 mg/day remainder study .</detailed_description>
