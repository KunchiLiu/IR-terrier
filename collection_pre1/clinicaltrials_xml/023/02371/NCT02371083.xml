	<brief_summary>This prospective trial investigate optimal timing care vaginal pessary . A vaginal pessary silicone device place vagina support pelvic organs woman pelvic organ prolapse . Some woman willing able remove pessary regular basis . In woman either unwilling unable remove pessary , complete pessary care provide urogynecology office . Complete pessary care involve regular removal clean pessary vaginal examination . In practice , investigator typically remove vaginal pessary examine vagina every 3 month patient investigator provide complete pessary care . Interval pessary removal varies widely practitioner .

	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , non-blinded trial office-based pessary care . The primary outcome study vaginal epithelial abnormality , include granulation tissue ulceration . Secondary outcome include participant satisfaction , degree bother due vaginal discharge , number unscheduled visit progression pelvic organ prolapse quantification score ( POPQS ) . At baseline ( visit 1 ; see `` Visit Schedule '' , ) , woman consent participate randomize 1:1 one two group : 1. routine group : pessary care removal clean every 12 ± 2 week , 2. extend group : pessary care removal clean every 24 ± 2 week . Randomization perform use randomization scheme available Excel . Each consecutive/sequential participant assign whichever group correspond sequential study entry number . For group , pessary remove cleaned vaginal examination perform every visit regardless complaint . The difference frequency visit . All pelvic examination perform individual . The study conduct approximately one year , additional time analysis preparation abstract ( ) manuscript ( ) . Subjects ' participation consist five visit routine group , three visit extend group . Consent study participation obtain first visit . Visit schedule show : Visit Schedule Routine Group Visit # 1 , initial visit ( week 0 ) , procedure : Consent participate , Collect Demographics , Pelvic examination /pessary removal Consent participate Visit # 2 , interim visit ( week 12 ± 2 ) , procedure : Interview , Pelvic examination /pessary removal Visit # 3 , interim visit ( week 24 ± 2 ) , procedure : Interview , Pelvic examination /pessary removal Visit # 4 , interim visit ( week 36 ± 2 ) , procedure : Interview , Pelvic examination /pessary removal Visit # 5 , final visit ( week 48 ± 2 ) , procedure : Interview , Pelvic examination /pessary removal Extended Group Visit # 1 , initial visit ( week 0 ) , procedure : Consent participate , Collect Demographics , Pelvic examination /pessary removal Consent participate Visit # 2 , interim visit ( week 24 ± 2 ) , procedure : Interview , Pelvic examination /pessary removal Visit # 3 , final visit ( week 48 ± 2 ) , procedure : Interview , Pelvic examination /pessary removal Participants approach upper bound visit window remind need visit . Those still present outside window interim visit schedule next appointment would schedule presented visit correct time . Any case note analysis protocol deviation form complete sent IRB . Any participant miss three visit within schedule window withdrawn study . Consent study participation occur visit # 1 , vaginal examination perform document pelvic organ prolapse quantification score8 ( POPQS ) exclude presence vaginal epithelial abnormality ( granulation tissue , erosion ) , fistula note presence vaginal adhesion . Additional data collect initial visit : age , body mass index ( BMI ) , smoke status , history diabetes mellitus , history surgery incontinence pelvic organ prolapse , history hysterectomy , indication pessary use , pessary size type , duration pessary use current pessary total participant use pessary past , whether participant intimate partner , use aspirin ( ASA ) dose , use anticoagulation therapy , parity , bother vaginal discharge , presence vaginal bleeding , history vaginal epithelial abnormality . The investigator also document participant use hormone replacement ( HRT ) . If participant use HRT , investigator document medication , dose , route frequency . Participants follow 48 ± 2 week . At interim visit , data assess update : Has participant start new medication ( ASA , anticoagulation , HRT ) ? Is subject bother vaginal discharge ? Is vaginal bleed present ? At interim visit , pessary remove , vaginal examination perform evaluate presence vaginal epithelial abnormality vaginal adhesion . When abnormality note , describe appearance , location , number , size . Additionally , abnormality stag use follow system : Stage Description 1 . Epithelial erythemya without epithelial break presence granulation tissue ≤1cm size . 2 . Epithelial break erosion ≤ 0.5 cm diameter presence granulation tissue &gt; 1cm size . 3 . Epithelial break erosion 1-2cm diameter . 4 . Epithelial break erosion &gt; 2 cm diameter . If one epithelial abnormality note , assign stage . The high stage abnormality determine overall stage epithelial abnormality . If change pessary type size , document . If pessary change type ring gellhorn , participant continue study schedule . If pessary remove left vagina , document . At final visit , participant undergo pelvic examination pessary removal . Data collect form design accord study group ( routine/extended ) visit number . In case participant pessary complaint require evaluation office outside schedule visit accord group allocation , unscheduled visit form use collect data visit . At unscheduled visit , data collect collected scheduled follow-up visit . Additionally , participant 's complaint/visit reason describe .</detailed_description>
