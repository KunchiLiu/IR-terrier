	<brief_title>VPM1002BC Recurrent Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapy background For intermediate/high risk NMIBC clinical guideline recommend standard therapy complete transurethral resection bladder tumor ( ) ( TURB ) , follow immunotherapy six weekly intravesical instillation approx . 5x10E8 CFUs Bacillus Calmette Guérin ( BCG ) maintenance BCG therapy least one year . In addition prevention recurrence progression NMIBC , use BCG mean initiate anti-tumor immunity show prolong overall survival compare TURB alone . BCG also show superior intravesical chemotherapy combination BCG maintenance . Worldwide , 200,000 patient treat BCG annually , 30-50 % likely recur . While NMIBC incidence increase past decade , death rate remain low due efficacy intravesical BCG therapy . Failure BCG therapy occur 40-50 % patient term disease recurrence progression . Due high risk disease progression lack predictive marker risk progression , radical cystectomy preferred option patient fail respond first course standard BCG therapy , accord current guideline . However , second course BCG appropriate non high-grade even high-grade recurrent tumor . Based retrospective study , second induction course may achieve 30 % 50 % response rate patient initial complete response patient persistent carcinoma situ ( CIS ) first course BCG induction therapy . Only data available prospective study regard outcome second BCG therapy cycle BCG failure . Di Lorenzo et al ( 2010 ) report 40 patient receive BCG reinduction : 87.5 % patient fail respond BCG re-induction one year ; one patient die systemic disease , 37.5 % patient undergo cystectomy 40 % underwent radiation therapy plus systemic chemotherapy 1 year . Of note , initially patient unwilling unfit undergo cystectomy . In trial , BCG reinduction prospectively compare intravesical chemotherapy gemcitabine . The result indicate small benefit gemcitabine term recurrence-free survival difference term progression-free survival . The poor outcome patient fail respond BCG therapy reflect unmet medical need improve bladder spar treatment BCG intravesical treatment failure . We need good treatment option patient fail respond BCG therapy patient high risk cancer progression . Ultimately , improved treatment high-risk patient increase bladder preservation rate consequence , improve quality life decrease health cost . Rationale perform trial Despite proven efficacy BCG treatment patient NMIBC , recurrence-free progression-free survival still poor . Oddens coworkers ( 2013 ) report ~35-45 % patient recur 5 year ~10-13 % patient progress . Recurrence progression muscle invasive disease lead additional surgical radio-oncological intervention include transurethral resection bladder ( TURB ) , cystectomy , chemo-radiotherapy . Improvement recurrence-free progression-free survival rate NMIBC , therefore , would lead less surgery , good quality life ( QoL ) , probably well overall survival . For patient fail first course standard BCG therapy , current guideline recommend radical cystectomy . Alternative option patient include re-treatment BCG intravesical chemotherapy ( include multimodal therapy ) . The early BCG failure , probable failure second BCG cycle . Only data available regard outcome second cycle BCG BCG failure . Rosevear ( 2011 ) report 66 % complete response BCG +IFN-α therapy 6 month therapy Di Lorenzo ( 2010 ) report even bad 6-month recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) ~62 % ( 3 % 24 month ) . As , good treatment option need first line therapy also patient recurrence first course standard BCG therapy . VPM1002BC live genetically modify Mycobacterium bovis BCG originally develop vaccine tuberculosis . VPM1002BC innovative mode action unique potential inducing tumor specific immune response . VPM1002BC least potent currently use BCG strain evoke immune response . Moreover , base preclinical data , favourable adverse event profile expect . Therefore , pivotal final goal trial test VPM1002BC safe , well tolerate efficacious treatment NMIBC . VPM1002BC test safety , efficacy , tolerability immunogenicity phase I/II clinical trial , respectively , patient tumor recurrence standard BCG accord EAU guideline unwilling unfit undergo cystectomy . Thus , reason choose study population base fact population high need innovative treatment establish VPM1002BC safe effective immunotherapy NMIBC . A phase I/II design choose order able ass safety preliminary efficacy tolerability VPM1002BC . As patient population qualify trial rare conventional BCG re-treatment show poor poor result ( see ) decide use single arm design compare efficacy tolerability report result . Based condition , calculate sample size 39-45 patient result reasonable number patient term recruitment feasibility . To best knowledge VPM1002BC first man trial recombinant intravesical bacteria first-in-man intra-bladder application VPM1002BC . Trial Treatment VPM1002BC administer per week intravesical instillation follow : Induction : - 6 instillation weekly interval . First instillation do within 14 day registration correspond day 1 trial treatment schedule ( = treatment start ) . Maintenance : - 3 instillation weekly interval start week 13 day 1 - 3 instillation weekly interval start week 25 day 1 - 3 instillation weekly interval start week 49 day 1 Measurements procedure : Baseline assessments trial therapy consist radiological assessment , transurethral biopsy prostatic urethra men ( case suspect previous CIS ) follow stag TUR prostate ( case positive transurethral biopsy prostatic urethra ) , PPD testing , TURB histological confirmation NMIBC ( urothelial carcinoma ) include second TURB confirmation tumor-free state except pure CIS bladder , physical examination , ultrasound bladder , blood test safety parameter , HIV , pregnancy test woman child-bearing potential . In phase I , induction therapy , every weekly instillation : blood assessment safety parameter ( instillation day instillation ) , urine assessment ( Nitrite , urine culture ) , urine cytology bladder wash instillation 1 , vital sign ( instillation day instillation ) . In addition , instillation 1 6 : assessment excretion VPM1002BC blood , urine sputum . In phase II , induction therapy , instillation 1 , 3 6 ( instillation ) : blood assessment safety parameter , urine assessment ( Nitrite , urine culture ) . In addition , instillation 1 : physical examination include vital sign weight , urine cytology bladder wash. During maintenance therapy ( phase I II ) , instillation 1 3 ( instillation ) : blood assessment safety parameter , urine assessment ( Nitrite , urine culture ) . In addition , first instillation : physical examination temperature . At week 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 : cystoscopy , urine cytology bladder wash , physical examination . The following investigation perform end treatment ( week 60 ) : PPD testing , physical examination include vital sign weight , blood assessment safety parameter , urine assessment ( Nitrite , urine cytology bladder wash , urine culture ) , cystoscopy/cytology , abdominopelvic contrast enhance CT scan . Adverse event record continuously throughout trial treatment . Treatment-related adverse event followed-up resolution stabilization . Quality Life assess baseline , start maintenance end trial treatment . During follow-up phase : survival status , recurrence progression report every 3 month first 2 year thereafter every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
