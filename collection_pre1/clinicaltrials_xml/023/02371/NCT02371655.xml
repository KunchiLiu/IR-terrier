	<detailed_description>Bowel preparation safe well tolerated patient , particularly screen set . For reason , limited bowel preparation extensively investigate . Usually , combine use low-fibre diet faecal/fluid tagging . The ingestion positive contrast agent ( either barium , iodine combination two ) , need differentiate stool fluid residues true colonic lesion , consider mandatory . A low-fibre diet aim improve residue homogeneity facilitate tag ; however , n't significative evidence support . The aim study compare new regimen reduce bowel preparation include low fiber diet another reduce bowel preparation include low-fiber diet . Primary outcome overall quality bowel preparation .</detailed_description>
