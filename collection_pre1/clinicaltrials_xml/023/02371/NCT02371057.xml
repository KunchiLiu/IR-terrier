If explanation study agree participate blood take assessment IGF-I ask complete simple questionnaire . The aim screen 1000 consecutive patient . The questionnaire incorporate five simple question complete 'yes ' 'no ' answer . Where IGF-I level elevate patient investigated possibility acromegaly . The presence biochemically proven acromegaly use determine simple question sufficient sensitivity use screen tool .</brief_summary>
