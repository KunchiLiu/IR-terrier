	<brief_summary>Background : - Tuberculosis ( TB ) lung infection cause bacteria . When people TB cough , may spread bacteria . Researchers look new TB medicine . They want find fast way tell drug might combat TB . Objective : - To learn effect different anti-TB drug microbiological , radiographic immunologic marker people TB . Eligibility : - Adults age 18-65 weigh 30-90 kg common TB bacteria treat common TB medicine . Design : - Participants admit hospital screening . They medical history , physical exam , chest radiograph . They give blood , urine , sputum sample . - Participants put 1 8 group . - Participants get one combination TB medicine daily 14 day . - Each day , participant : - Will discuss side effect . - May physical exam . - Will spit mucus cup . They may breathe saline water nebulizer make cough . - Participants blood take 3-4 time study - Participants 2-3 Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography ( FDG-PET/CT ) scan . FDG radioactive sugar molecule help measure TB disease lung . It inject vein . Participants lie scanner take picture . - Around study day 14 , participant leave hospital . They refer local TB clinic . There get standard 4 TB medicine . Those group 8 already medicine another FDG-PET/CT day 28 . - Participants study 28 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NexGen EBA Radiologic Immunologic Biomarkers Sterilizing Drug Activity Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early bactericidal activity ( EBA ) , measure decline serial sputum colony form unit ( CFU ) count first 2-14 day treatment , use extensively mean initially evaluating potency individual combination antituberculous agent . This approach endorse Global Alliance TB Drug Development US FDA . However , EBA seem correlate poorly relative ability agent prevent relapse produce durable cure ( often refer sterilize activity ) . The reason discrepancy may limitation sputum measurement capture population persist beyond airway surface discrete lesion granulomas , nodule , cavity . The elimination persistent population depend pharmacodynamic property regimen may better capture biologic functional marker reflect dynamic treatment effect within relevant host environment . Recent study response TB chemotherapy identify promising new biomarkers sterilization 2 area . First , immunologic change appear potential small subject cohort predict sterilize cure within 1 month commence treatment . Second , F-FDG PET/CT use tuberculosis qualitative mean assess drug response small case series multiple time point , start early 1 month . PET activity reflect uptake phosphorylation FDG neutrophils macrophage , CT provide structural information disease pathology . Hence , PET/CT data may offer additional insight lesion-specific sterilize activity . This study add 18F-FDG PET/CT scan immunological assay 0 , 2 , ( HRZE arm ) 4 week standard EBA methodology use regimen contain isoniazid ( INH ) , rifampin ( RIF ) , pyrazinamide ( PZA ) , moxifloxacin ( MXF ) , ethambutol ( EM ) . We hypothesize drug regimen associate high sterilizing activity ( e.g. , contain rifampin pyrazinamide ) show distinctive early cytokine chemokine pattern discrete , quantifiable change PET/CT certain lesion type 2-week period , compare drug regimens poor sterilize activity ( e.g. , contain isoniazid moxifloxacin ) . Demonstration association would provide rationale include radiologic immunologic analysis , alongside conventional EBA , early phase clinical study novel drug , would also provide important new insight biology human bacterial response TB drug .</detailed_description>
