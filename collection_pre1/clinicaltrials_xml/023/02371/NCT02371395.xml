	<brief_summary>Worldwide , approximately 2 billion people live area risk malaria morbidity surpass 250 million case , approximately 800,000 death , per year . Of four specie malaria parasite cause human infection , P. falciparum responsible majority severe malaria case follow P. vivax . Early accurate diagnosis essential prompt correct treatment , reduce death rate interrupt transmission . Currently , conventional method diagnosis malaria include microscopic examination thin thick blood smear rapid diagnostic test ( RDTs ) . Light microscopy practice typically detect parasitemia low 100 parasites/Âµl differentiate specie . The advantage microscopy include ability estimate parasitemia , possibility identify parasite stage , include gametocyte , low cost . However , method labor intensive , difficult standardize , require well-trained microscopist . The majority RDTs base detection P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 ( HRP-2 ) antigen detect malaria specie . RDTs detect lactose dehydrogenase ( LDH ) aldolase generally broadly react four specie malaria parasite therefore differentiate among specie although effort underway improve performance specie detection . In setting multiple malaria specie co-circulate , molecular method may reliable microscopy RDTs accurately diagnose specie malaria parasite low parasitemia . However , conventional molecular method , nested polymerase chain reaction ( nested PCR ) real-time PCR , technically challenge resource intensive generally restrict reference laboratory due need well-equipped laboratory . Recently , new molecular method use field setting develop opens new opportunity explore molecular tool malaria diagnosis endemic country . With objective facilitating use molecular tool malaria control program , malaria laboratory Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) Atlanta , USA develop simple isothermal molecular method call Real-Time Fluorescence Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification ( RealAmp ) diagnosis malaria . Currently , RealAmp primer exist detect Plasmodium genus detection P. falciparum P. vivax specie . The RealAmp method great potential molecular tool diagnosis malaria field ( infection major public health impact , HIV tuberculosis ) . It provide alternative conventional PCR-based diagnostic method field use clinical operational program . The objective proposal validate sensitivity RealAmp detection malaria parasites blood spot patient clinical diagnosis malaria two endemic state Brazil co-circulation P. falciparum P. vivax . In evaluation , RealAmp microscopic examination compare real-time PCR method reference test .</brief_summary>
