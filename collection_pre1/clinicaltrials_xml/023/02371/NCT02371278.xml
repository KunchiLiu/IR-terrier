	<brief_summary>The loss muscle mass age associate dysregulation muscle protein synthesis ( MPS ) generally characterize suppress MPS response protein ingestion . This 'anabolic resistance ' protein feed overcome ingestion large protein serving ( ~0.4g/kg/meal , equivalent ~ 30 - 40g/meal ) ; however , old adult would likely find challenging consume quantity protein per meal basis . The amino acid leucine unique role key 'activator ' MPS . Some research show increase leucine content suboptimal dose protein supplement enhance MPS response older adult . However currently unknown whether co-ingestion leucine normal , mixed meal increase MPS . Furthermore , suggest leucine supplementation may benefit old adult consume suboptimal daily protein intake . Therefore , purpose current study examine impact leucine co-ingestion mixed macronutrient meal myofibrillar protein synthetic response old men consume daily protein intake current recommendation . A objective determine whether myofibrillar protein synthetic response session resistance exercise enhance leucine supplementation meal . The investigator hypothesize , exercise non-exercised condition , leucine co-ingestion meal enhance integrative myofibrillar protein synthesis old adult consume low daily protein intake , augment MPS consume high daily protein . The investigator hypothesize influence leucine supplementation MPS great exercise condition non-exercise condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At baseline , participant ask wear pedometer complete physical activity weigh food record 3 day . Resting energy expenditure ( indirect calorimetry ) , body weight body composition ( DEXA ) assess fasted state . A strength test conduct determine 1 repetition maximum ( 1-RM ) maximum load participant lift 15 - 24 repetition use seat leg extension machine . Participants randomize one two group match age , activity level BMI : high ( 1.2 g/kg/d ) low daily protein ( 0.8 g/kg/d ) . Participants commence 9 day control diet ( day -3 6 ) design meet energy requirement weight maintenance provide daily protein intake accord participant 's group allocation ( i.e . 0.8 1.2 g/kg/d ) . All participant provide flavored , supplemental beverage ( Infinit Nutrition , Windsor , Ontario ) instruct consume one beverage half way meal day 0 - 5 . Individual serving supplement package ziplocked pouch Infinit Nutrition power form . Participants require add water power home . During day 0 - 2 ( unsupplemented period ) beverage placebo ( maltodextrin sucrose ) , day 3 - 5 ( leucine supplementation period ) beverage contain crystalline leucine ( 5 g ) sucrose flavour . The beverage provide single-blind manner , energy-matched similar odour , color , taste . Participants also blind group allocation . Aminoacidemia , insulinemia glycaemia determine response breakfast , lunch dinner ingestion unsupplemented ( day 2 ) leucine supplement ( day 5 ) period . During blood sample trial blood sample obtain immediately 20 , 40 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 240 min follow ingestion meal ( total 25 x 4ml blood sample per participant per trial ) . Integrative MPS measure exercise non-exercised leg unsupplemented ( day 0 - 3 ) period leucine supplement ( day 3 - 6 ) period use orally ingest deuterated water ( D20 ) muscle biopsy obtain vastus lateralis day 0 , 3 6 . Participants report laboratory fast state day 0 , follow muscle biopsy vastus lateralis saliva sample , participant consume single 100 ml oral bolus D20 approximately 0900 . Immediately follow D20 bolus participant perform bout unilateral leg extension exercise ( 3 set volitional failure maximum load lift 15-24 repetition ( ~40-50 % 1-RM ) ) . On day 3 participant perform identical resistance exercise session exception repetition clamp number achieve day 0 . Following exercise session participant consume individualize breakfast ( placebo beverage day 0 leucine beverage day 3 ) laboratory return home . Bilateral muscle biopsy obtain prior exercise day 3 ( end unsupplemented period ) day 6 ( end leucine supplemented period ) . Total body water deuterium enrichment use surrogate plasma alanine labelling determine saliva swab collect participant every morning 0900 . Participants instruct eat drink anything 30 min saliva sample sample store participant 's freezer next visit laboratory .</detailed_description>
