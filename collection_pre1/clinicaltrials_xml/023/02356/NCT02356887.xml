	<brief_summary>During neurosurgical procedure , patient need place sit position surgical access especially surgeries vertex posterior fossa . Due gravitational effect sit position flow IJV may reduce . Venous air embolism ( VAE ) common complication sit position craniotomy carry high mortality morbidity . Venous pressure decrease head patient raise heart . Hence , negative venous pressure cerebral venous system promote entrapment air accidental opening sinus . Common methods prevent VAE sit position include increase venous pressure either jugular venous compression and/or increase venous pressure add positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) . Both method decrease venous return lead brain swelling.. In addition , improper neck position cause kink IJV may lead decrease venous drainage increase ICP . This show contribute factor intraoperative brain swell postoperative neck tongue swell lead airway obstruction . Optimal brain perfusion best neutral position head , surgery always perform . Currently , study look IJV flow sit position effect venous outflow obstruction IJV flow . Valsalva maneuver ( force inspiration close glottis ) /or compression internal jugular vein ( IJV ) two commonly use physiological method cause venous outflow obstruction . A custom make neck collar use compression internal jugular vein previous investigation use similar device rat model demonstrate protective effect slosh-mediated brain injury increase intracranial blood volume . While collar yet study people effectiveness prevent concussion , many study look effect neck collar jugular compression ICP.. The purpose study measure venous blood flow healthy volunteer use ultrasound Doppler velocimetry sit position . investigator measure IJV flow side sit position rest two condition venous outflow obstruction- 1 . Neck compression use custom make collar 2 . During 30 second Valsalva maneuver . This study provide information cerebral venous drainage . This information useful planning positioning patient undergoing neurosurgical procedure prevent complication improper patient position .</brief_summary>
