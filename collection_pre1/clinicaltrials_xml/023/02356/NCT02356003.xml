	<brief_title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Children With Tourette 's Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Tourette syndrome common . It affect 80,000 Canadian youth . Tics core symptom Tourette syndrome . These repetitive , sudden , semi-voluntary movement sound . In child , tic especially bad require treatment , however , option limit . Medications Tourette syndrome carry significant risk side effect . Behavioral treatment , like habit reversal therapy , show promise safe , difficult apply young child . It time practice youth Tourette syndrome well able suppress tic . Finally , neither medication behavior therapy directly target root cause tic . For reason , new intervention need . Specific Objectives The investigator target key brain region involve tic . It call supplementary motor area . Using low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation , inhibit activity brain region , similar way tic suppression develop age . The investigator propose follow specific objective : ( Aim 1 ) The investigator characterize effect low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation supplementary motor area Tourette syndrome symptom . They hypothesize Tourette syndrome symptom severity ( measure Yale Global Tic severity Scale ) decrease low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation target supplementary motor area . ( Aim 2 ) The investigator identify change brain metabolite ( glutamate GABA ) functional connectivity cause low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation normalize brain activity . They hypothesize improvement Tourette syndrome symptom moderate low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation induce change GABA glutamate supplementary motor area . This assessed proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy , potentiation GABAergic neurotransmission assess short-interval cortical inhibition , change functional connectivity supplementary motor area primary motor cortex . Methods Eleven child ( 7-12 year age ) Tourette syndrome undergo low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( 5 time week three week ) . The investigator assess key variable interview brain imaging child three-week intervention . After three week , look change tic severity brain chemistry function . Expected Results The investigator pioneer transcranial magnetic stimulation application child adolescent population . By develop novel avenue treat Tourette syndrome , directly impact care child reduce severity tic improve quality life .</detailed_description>
