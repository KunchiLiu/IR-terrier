	<detailed_description>Amputation devastate complication diabetes precede &gt; 80 % case foot ulcer . Veterans diabetes risk incident foot ulcer , particularly neuropathy , vascular disease anatomic abnormality . This risk worsen poor foot self-care , poor foot self-monitoring and/or poor control A1c risk factor . It important activate at-risk Veterans improve self-care self-monitoring , low amputation risk . The PATRIOT study randomize control trial ( RCT ) test effectiveness personalized behavioral intervention ( PBI ) aim improve foot self-care , foot self-monitoring , modifiable risk amputation A1c , BP , LDL smoke use behavioral counseling combine dermal thermometry . The primary specific aim evaluate effect PBI proportion foot lesion ( ulcerative non-ulcerative ) compare current best practice ( CBP ) care diabetes . The secondary specific aim evaluate impact PBI foot self-care skill , foot education adherence , A1c , BP LDL , quality life 6 month well longer-term effect 12 month ; cost-effectiveness compare CBP . The also examine effect PBI CBP demonstrate foot self-care , plantar pressure , inflammation , satisfaction intervention acceptability . The investigator randomize 404 adult diabetes high normal risk foot ulcer [ Risk score 1 , 2 3 ( history ulcer amputation ) ] PBI CBP equally . The PBI cohesive , personalize intervention target foot self-care self-monitoring include dermal thermometry , diet , exercise , medication-taking incorporate self-regulatory theory , Transtheoretical Model Prospect Theory deliver use Motivational Interviewing principle teach back method . The intervention standardize fidelity intervention maintain . Through blind RCT , investigator test effect PBI relation CBP . Key outcomes non-ulcerative ulcerative lesion , foot-care skill , foot care education , adherence diet medication , general foot health-specific quality life , A1c , BP , LDL . Outcomes measured baseline , 6 12 month . All analyse intent-to-treat . This study evaluate cohesive risk-stratified personalized behavioral intervention aim improve self-care , enhance self-monitoring reduce incident ulcer adult without previous diabetic foot ulcer . This study apply establish behavioral theory combine new technology intervene improve care adult diabetes risk amputation . If promising theory-driven primary prevention approach prevent foot lesion work clinical setting improvement foot care urgently need , important scientific contribution could lower risk amputation adult diabetes .</detailed_description>
