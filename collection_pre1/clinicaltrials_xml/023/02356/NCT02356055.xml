	<brief_summary>People Alzheimer 's disease relate dementias present change think , move emotionally respond daily life situation . While type dementia dictate severe certain symptom , people dementia report gradual change function daily life skill . Losing ability daily life task , use cell phone , balance checkbook get dress morning signifies loss person dementia caregiver . Caregivers assist daily life task report depression anxiety , well high burden care . People dementia lose ability perform daily task report depression decrease satisfaction life . Despite gain research , researcher still miss important piece improve rehabilitation intervention improve daily life skill . In order address need people dementia , intervention call Skill-building Task-Oriented Motor Practice ( STOMP ) develop occupational therapist . Our team propose improvement daily life skill possible certain circumstance . First , daily life task person address rehabilitation personally-meaningful also task practice therapy call `` task-oriented training '' . For example , person trouble make sandwich practice make sandwich . Second , investigator propose people dementia need lot `` correct practice '' brain time `` rewire '' task correctly . Therefore , patient practice task use STOMP , investigator allow participant make error patient practice long periods time . Investigators also incorporate provide new technology training medication reminder alarm photo phone allow dial number choose love one 's picture . In pilot study , investigator want look closely amount time practice influence study outcomes . The investigator believe finding study support belief time therapy need enhance someone dementia learns .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . BACKGROUND : Progressive disability activity daily live ( ADL ) inevitable people Alzheimer 's disease relate dementia ( ADRD ) . Attempts slow prevent ADL disability unsuccessful despite make progress behavioral training method . Missing research emphasis investigator maximize patient 's engagement training rigorous examination implementation protocol ( dose train method ) may advantage learn people ADRD . Our team address gap development STOMP ( Skill-building Task-Oriented Motor Practice ) intervention create method obtain ADL goal support `` personhood '' test high-intensity protocol appear advantage learn well sustain learning time . Through first specific aim , investigator examine learn retention learning advantage offer receipt intensive versus less-intensive STOMP protocol . In second aim , investigator examine sustain attention task train differential contributor outcome . B . RESEARCH DESIGN/METHODS 1 . Design : Randomized-controlled trial two-week intervention period 3-month post-intervention follow-up period occur 24 month . The investigator employ block randomization participant randomize block randomly choose set two four , ultimately result eight participant randomize group first year total 16 participant assign group end 20 month . Two occupational therapist ( OT ) , blind group assignment complete baseline , post-intervention 3-month follow-up assessment . The treat occupational therapy assistant ( OTA ) give group assignment PI baseline evaluation complete . 2 . Recruitment : The investigator intend recruit 32 participant ( assent ) legally-authorized representative ( informed consent ) employ variety method . The primary recruitment strategy use direct mailing successfully use team recruit people ADRD.9 A letter invitation explain study way participate mail zip code adjacent University Oklahoma Health Sciences Center ( OUHSC ) United States Postal Service . Second , collaborate physician ( Drs . Hershey Odenheimer ) refer appropriate candidate . Dr. Hershey , neurologist specialize dementia diagnosis treatment OUHSC , see &gt; 200 people/year various form dementia . Dr. Odenheimer , neurologist VA see 30 new patients/year dementia 45 unique return visits/year . Other forms recruitment include : medium ( e.g. , campus email , newspaper advertisement , website , television news story ) presentation local chapter Alzheimer 's Association support group . Previous recruitment occur primarily media/presentations ( 60 % ) physician recruitment ( 40 % ) . 3 . Procedures : Figure 2 clearly outline manualized study procedure teach OT/OTA 40-hour certification course . Protocol preparation : The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure ( COPM ) include semi-structured interview assist OT facilitating family/participant choose ADL , home management leisure goal support retention personhood person dementia . Goals choose COPM perform participant assess OT order develop measurable GAS outcome . Each goal must identifiable begin conclude step creation `` practice-able '' step task-oriented training . Practice-able step embed task modification assistive technology determine OT support performance situate contextually within participant 's habit environment . To enhance transfer training caregiver , invite caregiver watch intervention daily require hands-on training intervention one day/week . The intervention protocol incorporate important multi-component feature motor learning . Each group practice task many time possible allotted time training . For intensive protocol , hour training focus 1 3 identified goal include 50 minute intervention 10 minute break . The less-intensive protocol base home health treatment protocols patient see 1-2 days/week one hour/day . In less-intensive protocol , 3 ADL goal practice many time possible within 20 minute schedule hour . In protocol , OTA employ errorless learn participant prevent making error scaffold trainer guidance progress hand-over-hand training , provision tactile verbal cue , possible , cue errorless performance . Continuous verbal feedback provide participant initially minimize training progress . Post-intervention , caregiver support question problem interfere continued practice provide monthly 3-month follow-up . 4 . Statistical Methods A two-sided 0.05 alpha level use define statistical significance . An intent-to-treat paradigm follow data randomize patient analyze intervention assignment without regard adherence outcome . Aim 1 : Examine advantage learn retention learn provide receipt intensive STOMP protocol versus less-intensive protocol . Plan : Changes pre- post-intervention ( immediate 90 day ) GAS T-scores/COPM mean score compare intervention group use repeated measure ANOVA time intervention interaction term test determine estimate effect intervention program differs follow-up period . Analyses stratify post-intervention time point significant interaction find . Residual diagnostics create assess adequacy model assumption . Non-parametric analysis use , focus 3-month difference , ANOVA model assumption satisfy . Aim 2 : Examine sustain attention task contributor differential outcome . Plan : Using data Sustained Attention Task behavioral form ( Sec.3f ) , tally amount time spend 3 ADL goal 2 week intervention . Total minute task categorize tertiles plot change GAS COPM score , post-intervention 3-month follow-up . 5 . Study Timeline* - Patient follow-up complete month 23 assure time final data analysis . 6 . Data Management : Data capture , quality assurance , management , processing consolidated use well-established Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) system.10 REDCap secure , web-based application design support data capture research study , provide : 1 ) intuitive interface validate data entry ; 2 ) audit trail track data manipulation export procedure ; 3 ) automate export procedure seamless data downloads common statistical package ; 4 ) procedure import data external source . Online data capture form create use REDCap , export pdf file , print off-line use hard copy available data check . REDCap allow multi-personnel access project file use PI , evaluator trainer capture data . C. POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES Three hour intervention daily may result fatigue , refusal display negative behavior . Due repetitive nature STOMP , tally number negative behavior include wander , purposeless movement , verbal physical outburst mood-related verbalization average &lt; 1/hour across 3 hour treatment settings.1,2 We believe success part due 1 ) use licensed OT/OTAs ; 2 ) training interventionists manualized , STOMP protocol include identification behavioral sign specific redirections negative behavior ; 3 ) engage presence caregiver . Recruitment home-based study prove palatable community-dwelling older adult clinic-based . Based previous work , believe 30 day phone call largely influenced ability retain 100 % participant 90-day post-intervention follow-up . D. HUMAN PARTICIPANT SAFETY The risk participate study similar ADL task home . Strict safety principle observe walk safety belt deem necessary . The benefit participate study include assessment deficit occupational therapist , receive two week free intervention , provision adaptive equipment support functional skill home . The investigator believe benefit participate outweigh risk .</detailed_description>
