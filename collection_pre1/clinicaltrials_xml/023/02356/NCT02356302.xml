	<brief_title>Safety Pharmacokinetics Intravaginal Rings Containing Vicriviroc ( MK-4176 ) and/or MK-2048</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development safe effective HIV prevention strategy important global health priority . IVRs previously approve delivery method various medication , study evaluate IVRs contain HIV antiretroviral medication . The purpose study assess safety pharmacokinetics combination IVR call MK-2048A contains vicriviroc ( MK-4176 ) MK-2048 , compare IVRs contain vicriviroc alone MK-2048 alone . This study enroll healthy , HIV-uninfected woman , 18 45 year old . Participants randomly assign receive IVR contain either vicriviroc , MK-2048 , MK-2048A ( contain vicriviroc MK-2048 ) , placebo . Participants receive assign IVR enrollment visit , IVR remove Day 28 . Participants attend study visit screen , enrollment ( Day 0 ) , Days 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 35 . Study visit may include behavioral assessment , adherence counseling assessment , medical history review , physical examination , urine collection , blood collection , pelvic specimen collection , rectal specimen collection ( optional ) .</detailed_description>
