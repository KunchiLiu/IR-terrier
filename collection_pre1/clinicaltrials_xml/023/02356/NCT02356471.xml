	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well consumer-based activity monitor work evaluate measure activity old patient abdominal cancer undergo surgery . Consumer-based activity monitor ( CAM ) may identify patient at-risk increase post-surgery medical problem . With early identification at-risk patient , CAM provide supervise exercise preoperative postoperative period improve mobility potentially decrease preoperative complication among patient undergo major abdominal surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Consumer-Based Activity Monitor Evaluating Measuring Activity Older Patients With Abdominal Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To demonstrate feasibility adherence use consumer-based activity monitor preoperative period hospital well home . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate ability consumer-based activity monitor demonstrate 50 % decrease average daily step participant major oncologic surgery . II . To characterize in-home movement among old cancer patient . III . To compare in-home CAM data in-clinic pre- post-operative mobility test use Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) . IV . To compare in-home CAM data pre- post-operative self-reported mobility use Pepper Assessment Tool Disability ( PAT-D ) Mobility Assessment Tool-Short Form ( MAT-sf ) . V. To compare in-home CAM data self-reported daily activity data pre- post-operative period . VI . To determine estimate future study accrual , adherence , drop-out . VII . To obtain participant feedback participant determine potential study opportunity barrier . VIII . To identify potential key stakeholder potential patient partner development future grant submission . IX . To summarize baseline cognitive screen , physical assessment questionnaire ( Pepper Assessment Tool Disability , PAT-D ) , mobility assessment tool-short form ( MAT-sf ) , health-related quality life ( FACIT-G ) questionnaire , activity questionnaire ( Community Healthy Activities Model Program Seniors [ CHAMPS ] ) , pain assessment ( Pain Visual Analog Scale , PVAS ) , fatigue assessment ( Fatigue Visual Analog Scale , FVAS ) , physical function testing ( Short Physical Performance Battery time complete 400-meter walk ) . X. CAM data compare research grade activity data provide ActiGraph . OUTLINE : Patients wear Fitbit Zip ( portable pedometer device ) track physical activity 7 day undergo surgery 21 day undergo surgery . After completion study , patient follow 21 90 day .</detailed_description>
