	<brief_summary>Randomized controlled trial include 7 French transplantation center . Pre-inclusion patient make enlisted LT . Definitive inclusion randomization perform LT , patient undergo duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis graft bile duct diameter small 7mm . In intraductal stent tube group , custom-made segment T-tube place bile duct , remove endoscopically four six month postoperative . The surgical technique available movie randomization website . The primary endpoint occurrence biliary complication , include biliary fistula stricture , six month follow-up . Secondary evaluation criterion incidence complication related stent placement extraction endoscopy . Discussion : Biliary complication follow LT significant cause morbidity , retransplantation eventually mortality . Although controversial , use T-tube proven useless even responsible specific complication many study , include several randomized trial . However , several study identify small bile duct diameter risk factor biliary stenosis . A threshold 7mm find significantly associate biliary stenosis . Our team publish preliminary study include 20 patient use new technique intraductal stenting . Only 4 complication report overall study population biliary complication occur subgroup patient receive whole graft LT . Moreover , technical failure procedure-related complication note drain removal . Although intraductal stent tube duct-to duct biliary anastomosis seem feasible safe , multicentric randomize control study need validate protective tool biliary complication follow LT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Comparative , multicentric , prospective , randomized non-blinded , two-groups study . The follow-up set six month postoperative good screening majority biliary complication . The inclusion period set two year , total study duration 2.5 year . The patient ' inclusion make 7 liver transplantation center France . Patients ' inclusion perform consultation moment enlistment LT , inform content , benefit risk study , sign write consent . Definitive inclusion perform operating room , LT , depend fulfil follow `` definitive inclusion criterion '' ( see ) . The randomization perform operating room investigator coordinate Clinical Research Unit promoter ' center ( Saint Antoine Hospital , Paris ) , specific software accessible Internet . In IST group , surgeon place IST bile duct , custom-made segment ( 2 cm ) 8 French T-tube side hole . The stent insert biliary duct without suture fixation . In order minimize bias homogenize technique , short technical explanatory movie realize promoter 's team distribute center . Each center perform habitual postoperative follow . Clinical , biological , radiological exhaustive data collect Day 1 , Day 7 , Day 15 , Month 1 , Month 3 , Month 6 . A Magnetic Resonance Cholangiography ( MRC ) systematically perform six month post LT . In IST group , endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography ( ERCP ) sphincterotomy plan 4th 6th month post-transplantation , require short stay hospital , general anesthesia , clinical biological test include plasmatic lipase dosage Day 1 . Every undesirable event immediately report promoter investigation within severity . Severe undesirable event previously define .</detailed_description>
