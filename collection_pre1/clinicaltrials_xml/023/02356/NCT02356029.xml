	<brief_title>Perception Inappropriate CPR : Multicenter International Cross-sectional Survey</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The REAppropriate study international multicentric cross-sectional survey explore perception inappropriateness CPR . Objectives : The primary objective study determine prevalence perceive inappropriateness CPR ( PICPR ) last resuscitation perform out-of-hospital Emergency Department ( ED ) Healthcare Providers ( HCP ) work prehospital Ambulance Services EDs . PICPR define resuscitation effort perceive HCPs disproportionate expect prognosis patient term survival quality life . Prevalence PICPR define number HCPs reporting PICPR last cardiac arrest situation attend divided total number survey HCPs . Secondary objective evaluate hypothesis PICPR associate patient related factor also personal characteristic work related factor . Other objective assessment moral distress intentional job leave . In participate country National Coordinator nominate Steering Committee . National Coordinators select leading role national international scientific organisation related Emergency Medicine and/or teach research activity relate Emergency Medicine . Each National Coordinator establish network Local Investigators coordinate study proceeding within EDs Ambulance Services . Study population : The survey focus HCPs directly involve treatment cardiac arrest patient ( out-of-hospital ED ) : nurse , doctor , ED Technicians/Nurse Assistants Emergency Medical Technicians ( EMT ) /Paramedics work EDs prehospital Ambulance Services active Emergency Medical Services system country . Hospitals country without establish EDs group HCPs work inside hospital daily duty first care stabilisation patient arrive unplanned hospital also eligible participation study . The Local Investigator clearly delineate functional unit within hospital thus determine number eligible HCPs within center . Survey : Two electronic questionnaire use : one Local Investigator ED Ambulance Service one HCPs . Questionnaire Local Investigator : questionnaire request quantitative data organisational issue like number bed , ED Ambulance Service activity , number doctor , nurse , EMTs/Paramedics etc . question resuscitation practice . Questionnaire HCPs : HCPs ask personal characteristic educational background . There question work condition , job strain teamwork within professional environment .

Translation survey : A modified Brislin 's model translation use . The primary questionnaire English . Both questionnaire translate additional language ( call target language ) use following procedure : 1 . The first step forward translation English questionnaire target language two native speaker target language proficient knowledge English ideally background medical specialty cover topic research . 2 . The second step third person whose native language target language review translate version together translator step 1 grammatical style comprehensibility without English text ( monolingual person ) . The appropriate forward translation chosen . 3 . When achieved third step back translation English language appropriate forward translation two different bilingual person ( ideally native English speaking proficient knowledge target language ) blind original English version . Again effort make back translator professionally involved research field improve quality translation process . The two back translation review third person appropriate back translation chosen . 4 . In last fourth step Steering Committee compare appropriate back translation questionnaires original English version . If necessary , recommendation do modification . Throughout process regular interaction feedback Steering Committee optimise quality translation . Information Technology : All data collect use website especially design study . Normal web application use HTTP ( Hypertext Transfer Protocol ) transfer web page web server web browser . In order guarantee data safety HTTPS website sign trusted certificate authority use project . All transfer data encrypt circumstance read web browser web server . Ethics approval : For HCP risk associate participation study since survey completely anonymous . Insight medical file unnecessary complete questionnaire . The National Coordinator submit protocol one national ethical committee accord rule apply his/her jurisdiction . Ethical approval send Steering Committee . If necessary , write informed consent obtain participate HCPs . Otherwise , completion questionnaire HCP take evidence consent study participation . In country informed consent must obtain , preferable informed consent uniform whole country . Centers allow retrieve report data unless ethical approval report Steering Committee requirement ethical approval country .</detailed_description>
