	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize administration two widely available , naturally occur dietary supplement , 5 hydroxytryptophan creatine monohydrate , reduce severity depression individual expose chronic hypoxia live altitude . The purpose study determine 8 week dietary augmentation oral 5 g creatine daily 100 mg 5-HTP twice daily reduces hypoxia-related depressive symptom measure 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) woman SSRI SNRI-resistant depression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>5-hydroxytryptophan Creatine Treatment Resistant Depression Associated With Hypoxia Females</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Serotonin creatine process separately brain , deficit brain biochemicals lead distinct clinical problem . Therefore , investigator believe treatment combination therapy , could correct deficit , would synergistic effect treatment hypoxia-related depression possibly form treatment-resistant depression . Thus , investigator propose investigate antidepressant efficacy dietary 5-hydroxytryptophan ( 5-HTP ) creatine , mean restore brain neurotransmitter metabolic imbalance link chronic hypoxia cause high altitude residence .</detailed_description>
