	<brief_summary>Patients suffer pancreatic cancer associate poor prognosis survival less one year expect inoperable tumour . Management patient would towards palliation symptom . Severe pain occur 50 70 % patient `` intractable '' pain often difficult treat . Different pharmacological agent use past control pain include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug narcotic agent . However , patient ' response often variable difficult predict . Furthermore , agent associate adverse effect may impair quality life . Celiac plexus neurolysis ( CPN ) first described 1919 , since , different approach perform procedure describe . The standard technique involve percutaneous approach CPN also perform intra-operative approach open laparoscopic mean . Results meta-analysis show CPN associate superior pain relief compare analgesic therapy alone reduces need opioids analgesic patient inoperable pancreatic cancer . Furthermore , CPN cause few adverse effect opioid analgesic prefer method improve pain relief patient . Recently , endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) - guide CPN become popular . The approach safe effective show associate long last pain relieve patient suffer chronic pancreatitis pancreatic cancer . Serious complication uncommon less 2 % series . Transient diarrhoea hypotension common CPN see 30 % 40 % patient , regardless whether procedure do EUS percutaneous approach . The EUS approach offer several theoretical advantage percutaneous option . Most notably visualization celiac ganglion situate anterior aorta , allow direct injection ganglion alcohol result celiac ganglion neurolysis ( CGN ) . This increase accuracy CPN may result improved pain control . Furthermore , could reduce complication associate percutaneous approach include low extremity paresthesia paralysis . Hence , aim study compare efficacy safety endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) -guided celiac ganglion neurolysis ( CGN ) versus percutaneous celiac plexus neurolysis ( CPN ) reduce cancer pain patient suffer inoperable cancer . With direct visualization injection celiac ganglion , investigator hypothesis EUS-guided CGN advantageous improve pain relief decrease need opioid analgesic patient inoperable cancer compare percutaneous CPN .</brief_summary>
