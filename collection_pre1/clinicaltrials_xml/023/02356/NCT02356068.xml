	<brief_title>Predictions Bleeding During Liver Transplantation With Thromboelastometry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historically , orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLT ) associate major blood loss need massive blood product transfusion . The cause bleed OLT multifactorial . The extensive surgical trauma play major role origin bleed . This bleeding accelerate defect hemostatic system . Hemostatic defect divide present operation originate surgery . The latter classify accord 3 main system hemostasis : coagulation , platelet function , fibrinolysis . Hyperfibrinolysis important cause non surgical bleeding OLT . A significant decrease blood loss blood product requirement observe OLT past 10 year . This decrease explain increase experience , improvement surgical anesthetic technique , good understand various hemostatic abnormality encounter OLT . More 10 year ago , Reyle-Hahn Rossaint Dupont et al state necessary correct coagulation defect anhepatic phase . More recently , author poor correlation bleed peripheral index coagulation patient chronic liver disease . These patient cirrhosis investigate mean conventional test coagulation primary hemostasis prothrombin time ( INR ) , activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) , platelet count , skin bleeding time . Two important study raise serious question clinical use INR measuring liver disease prognosis estimate bleed risk thus call question many common traditional clinical practice . Now , cleat conventional test coagulation ( INR , platelet count , fibrinogen ) able predict blood product transfusion requirement bleed liver transplantation . A substantial body evidence suggest use blood product associate morbidity mortality . Because 33 % liver recipient acquire liver disease transfusion blood product , important establish strategy aim decrease blood loss consequently need transfusion . The ability predict intraoperative blood loss transfusion requirement would great help ensure adequate blood product enable appropriate therapy patient high risk bleeding . The ROTEM ( TEM ) thromboelastometry analyzer base throboelastographic principle , measure viscoelastic property whole blood coagulation generation lysis . The instrument provide important global hemostatic information plasma-platelet-leucocyte interaction clot tensile strength . TEM result available rapidly laboratory-based conventional coagulation test also provide additional information regard coagulation strength , platelet function , fibrinolysis . Kang et al 39 use thromboelastogram ( TEG ) show decrease red blood cell ( RBC ) use introduction TEG monitoring . ROTEM analysis include plasmatic coagulation fibrinolytic factor inhibitor , well circulate blood cell provide clinically important information quality final blood clot . The aim observational study determine ROTEM parameter able predict blood loss transfusion RBC liver transplantation .</detailed_description>
