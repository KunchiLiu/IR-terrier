	<brief_title>The Effect Episiotomy Maternal Fetal Outcomes ( EPITRIAL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Episiotomy one prevalent surgical intervention delivery room , range frequency 10 % 75 % . The presumed benefit procedure include prevention advance ( 3rd 4th degree ) perineal tear , facilitation fetal distress , easy suture compare spontaneous perineal tear , decrease postpartum pelvic organ injury include reduce risk urinary anal incontinence , facilitation labor case shoulder dystocia . However , cumulative evidence recent decade strongly point lack episiotomy efficiency . Moreover , many study indicate episiotomy may associate increase maternal morbidity term postpartum bleed pain , urinary incontinence severe perineal tear . Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis randomize control trial show selective episiotomy significantly decrease risk advance perineal tear ( relative risk 0.67 ) overall need perineal suturing ( relative risk 0.71 ) , compare routine episiotomy use . In addition , uniform definition indication episiotomy performance . In accordance literature evidence , hypothesize avoidance episiotomy associate increase risk maternal neonatal complication , compare selective episiotomy use . Thus , objective study compare maternal neonatal outcome group episiotomy perform selective episiotomy use . This randomize controlled clinical trial conduct seven Northern public Israeli Hospitals February 2015 February 2019 . The follow study protocol construct use consultation experience epidemiologist several senior obstetrician . Women fit inclusion criterion receive detailed explanation trial one approve investigator carefully read relevant form . In case agreement participation study , inform consent form sign . Each participant undergo randomization two group : 1 . Control group - decision perform episiotomy base routine delivery care . 2 . Study group - episiotomy perform . Deviation protocol episiotomy performance group allow discretion obstetrician charge delivery , case unequivocal benefit fetus . The randomization carry use computer software create random number . Allocation one two group do second stage labor open seal opaque envelope . Mediolateral lateral episiotomy ( accord accept management medical center ) perform crowning stage . The incision cut angle 45-60º , 3-4 cm length . Epidural anesthesia labor administer accordance patient 's request . Artificial rupture membrane , augmentation contraction oxytocin , decision perform vacuum extraction cesarean birth do discretion attend accoucher , accordance accept delivery management . The following data obtain participant : - Demographic obstetric characteristic , include maternal age , weight , height race , gestational age pregnancy complication , clinical sonographic estimate fetal weight . - Delivery neonatal parameter , include oxytocin use labor augmentation epidural anesthesia administration . - Primary secondary outcome measure ( describe elsewhere ) . Sample size calculation perform certified statistician extensive experience clinical trial . It base assumption worldwide rate advance perineal tear control group 1.6 % ( accord late data report annual Israeli Maternal Fetal Medicine society meeting November 2014 ) , rate tear study group 1.072 % ( base mention report Cochrane Collaboration analysis , demonstrate relative risk 0.67 selective vs. routine episiotomy use ) . Given confidence level 95 % power 80 % , require sample size 14,842 ( i.e . 7,421 woman group ) . A year trial initiation interim analysis carry , calculate up-to-date rate advance perineal tear . Sample size recalculate base rate . In case statistically significant difference primary outcome measure ( advanced perineal tear ) confidence level 0.003 , discontinuation trial consider due demonstrate efficacy . Otherwise , trial continue , require confidence level final statistical calculation 0.049 . At end data acquisition , statistical analysis carry . Primary secondary outcome measure compare two group . In addition , association episiotomy characteristic ( incision angle , length distance initiation point midperineum ) outcome measure assess . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS software ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) , accordance `` intention treat '' concept . Data present statistician blinded way , group `` 1 '' `` 2 '' , non-disclosure number interpretation . Continuous variable present mean ± SD compare use Student 's t-test Mann-Whitney test , appropriate . Categorical data express number ( percentage ) compare use Chi square test Fisher 's exact test , appropriate . Relative risk 95 % confidence interval calculate . A two tailed p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant comparison .</detailed_description>
