	<brief_summary>Bone metastases frequent distant manifestation cancer , pain common devastating consequence . The primary treatment painful bone metastasis , external beam radiation therapy , moderately effective : 60 % patient undergo conventional radiotherapy experience ( partial ) pain relief . Several factor associate treatment failure identify , attempt make collapse factor clinically useful prediction tool predict treatment response . In addition , aid therapy selection base expect survival time , development survival model essential . Finally , need innovative treatment alternative additive standard treatment option improve quality life ( QoL ) . For reason , set PRESENT cohort study , recruit patient department radiation oncology orthopedic surgery . We aim provide detailed information clinical data , create infrastructure efficient , fast pragmatic evaluation implementation innovative intervention , well development accurate new prediction tool .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Interventional Studies Bone Metastases - PRESENT Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PRESENT cohort set accord 'cohort multiple Randomised Controlled Trial ' design . The basis design prospective cohort patient bone metastasis , receive care usual , give informed consent cohort participation . At UMC Utrecht , patient furthermore ask informed consent randomize future RCTs conduct within cohort . Patients inform offer experimental intervention randomly select . They also inform otherwise might serve control without notify data use trial context . For patient cohort , clinical patient-reported outcome capture baseline regular interval follow-up . Within cohort , multiple RCTs conduct . For purpose , eligible patient provide consent require participate RCT within cohort identify . From subcohort , random selection patient invite undergo experimental intervention . Eligible participant randomly select receive standard care , inform experimental intervention serve control . Outcomes control group compare outcomes offer experimental intervention , order estimate effect experimental intervention versus usual care . Within cohort , process repeat trial intervention .</detailed_description>
