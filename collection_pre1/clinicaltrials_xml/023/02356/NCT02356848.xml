	<brief_summary>This study evaluate comprehensive tailor behavioral intervention aim improve foot self-care self-monitoring ( combine dermal thermometry ) prevent recurrent ulcer Veterans high risk amputation . This intervention may novel strategy improve self-care early detection foot abnormalities at-risk population use psychological theory target multiple health behavior simultaneously . This could efficient cost-effective approach improve diabetes-related foot health behavior , risk factor patient vulnerable devastating consequence relate amputation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Veterans diabetes previous ulcer high risk new ulcer amputation , particularly neuropathy vascular disease poor foot self-care nonadherence diet , medication , exercise recommendation . It difficult activate at-risk patient improve self-care detect foot abnormality inflammation early stage . Proposed randomize controlled trial test effectiveness comprehensive tailor intervention ( TI ) aim improve self-care self-monitoring ( include dermal thermometry ) behavioral counseling . The primary specific aim evaluate TI reduce proportion recurrent ulcer 18 month compare current practice ( CP ) group . The secondary specific aim evaluate impact TI time ulceration , quality life ( QOL ) , plantar pressure , physical activity foot care skill compare CP group . The investigator recruit adult diabetes previously heal ulcer . The intervention standardize fidelity intervention maintain . Using blind randomize control trial ( RCT ) , investigator test effect TI relation CP . Key outcomes ulceration , quality life ( QOL ) , plantar pressure , physical activity foot care skill . Outcomes measure baseline , 6 , 12 18 month . All analyse intent-to-treat . This study evaluate comprehensive tailor intervention target multiple behavior relate self-care amputation risk . This study apply advanced behavioral theory intervene improve care veteran risk amputation combine dermal thermometry . If promising theory-driven approach work clinical setting improvement foot care urgently need vulnerable Veterans previous ulcer , important scientific contribution could lower risk recurrent ulcer amputation Veterans diabetes .</detailed_description>
