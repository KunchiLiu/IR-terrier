	<detailed_description>The CHARMED study prospective , multicenter , cluster-randomized cross-over study six EDs France . Centers randomly assign use routine management systematic cross check first period , use alternative strategy second period ( Fig 1 ) . Patients recruit six center France In period , 9am 5pm , CRT present ED collect variable provider patient . In control period , usual care routine management provide . In intervention group , systematic cross-checking implement three time day 8:30am 6:00pm emergency physician . The CRT seek emergency physician ( EP ) pair crosschecking . Senior physician use peer crosschecking ( i.e . crosschecker also emergency senior physician ) . The CRT assist pairing . Each EP prepare present current patient . Patient presentation protocolised ( see ) , although usual presentation seek presentation method already place handover . The crosschecking occur presence CRT ED , medical office staff room , cubicle available . Each EP present patient actually take care , brief description case . After case present EP , comment advice crosschecker seek . In accordance national international recommendation 1,2,15 , follow definition use : Medical Error : Failure plan action complete intend , use wrong plan achieve aim . The severity error classify use National Coordinating Council Medical Error Reporting ( NCCMERP ) A I 16 , show table 2 . Adverse event ( AE ) : An injury might result medical care ( lack thereof ) . Near Miss : A medical error potential cause adverse event , either chance intervention . A near miss error severity B , C D. Preventable AE : An AE associate error . A preventable AE medical error severity E , F , G , H I . Severe Medical Error ( SME ) : preventable AE near miss . The primary objective ass whether implementation Systematic Cross Serious unexplained guideline violation ( local national ) , even absence document injury , consider AE . Checking ED reduce rate severe medical error . The primary endpoint rate SME seven day follow ED visit . As previously describe , subsequent adverse event might clearly appear ED setting , hence consider SME 8 . Hospital ED re-attendance within next 7 day also consider adverse event . Secondary endpoint include following : - Rate AE preventable AE - Rate Near Miss - Severity SME - Factors associate SME : - Related patient ( age , chief complaint , comorbidities , triage level ) - Related physician ( grade , experience , number physician involve , handoff ) - Related ED visit ( Time visit , daily occupancy , crowd , wait time , length stay , total number emergency physician )</detailed_description>
