	<detailed_description>Metabolic Syndrome ( MetS ) cluster multiple risk factor metabolic origin , associate increase risk cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes mellitus disease , include cancer . The National Cholesterol Education Program 's Adult Treatment Panel III ( NCEP-ATP III ) define MetS presence least three five diagnostic criterion consist measure waist circumference , fast glucose , systolic pressure and/or diastolic blood pressure , serum triglyceride HDL cholesterol .

Recently , increase interest researcher relationship MetS diet , specifically Mediterranean Diet ( MD ) . A problem contemporary MD quality carbohydrates food rich carbohydrate consume actually , white bread type pasta , produce refine flour , high glycemic index ( GI ) load ( GL ) . There numerous study show take large amount high GI GL food risk factor coronary heart disease type 2 diabetes . To knowledge diet trial compare health effect Mediterranean diet different quality carbohydrate . Objective study compare , randomize clinical trial , effect simple MD , Low Glycemic Index diet ( LGID ) , Low Glycemic Index MD ( LGIMD ) MetS , MetS components metabolic variable . For reason , baseline examination , participant randomly divide three group , receive specific dietary intervention , parameter measure first visit examine month third sixth .</detailed_description>
