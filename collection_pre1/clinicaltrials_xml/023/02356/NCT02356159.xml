	<brief_summary>Background : - In allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) , stem cell take donor give recipient . Sometimes recipient immune system destroy donor cell . Or donor immune cell attack recipient tissue , call graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . This less likely recipient donor similar human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) . Researchers want see drug palifermin improve result allogeneic SCT HLA-matched unrelated donor . Objective : - To see high dos palifermin chemotherapy safe , prevent chronic GVHD , improve immune function transplant . Eligibility : - Adults 18 70 blood bone marrow cancer HLA-matched sibling , possible HLA-matched donor . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . They scan heart lung exam . - Before transplant , participant : - Have many test exams . These include blood test throughout study bone marrow biopsy . - Get central line catheter one . - Have 1 3 round chemotherapy . - Take test make sure transplant , include medical history , physical exam , CT scan . - Get palifermin IV chemotherapy . They get drug , take 6 month . - Participants get SCT . - After transplant , participant : - Be hospitalize least 3 4 week . - Have test GVHD 60 day 6 month . These include mouth skin photo biopsy . - Stay near D.C. 3 month . - Visit NIH 5 time first 2 year , yearly . They may scan biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Palifermin ( Kepivance ) Persons Undergoing Unrelated Donor Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) impair immune reconstitution major transplant complication barrier improve outcome allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( alloHSCT ) hematologic malignancy . GVHD initiate donor T-cells become alloreactive recipient major minor histocompatibility antigens . This process may exacerbate transplantation process exposure tissue antigens donor T-lymphocytes chemotherapy-induced injury . - Palifermin , recombinant keratinocyte growth factor-1 ( KGF-1 ) , imitate action intrinsic KGF bind FGF receptor 2b , express epidermis , oral mucosa , GI mucosa urothelium , thereby increase regenerative capacity tissue . Palifermin show reduce duration severity oral mucositis intensive chemo-radiotherapy autologous HSCT hematologic cancer FDA approve . In pre-clinical study , palifermin show effect control acute chronic GVHD immune reconstitution alloHSCT . However , subsequent clinical study alloHSCT indicate dose schedule palifermin currently use human optimize activity term prevention GVHD thymus recovery follow alloHSCT . - We hypothesize high dos palifermin immediate pre alloHSCT condition set lead enhance thymopoiesis , decrease chronic GVHD , improve immune reconstitution . A dose escalation study necessary determine safe dosing level person undergo alloHSCT . Objectives : - The primary objective phase I portion assess safety tolerability administration recombinant keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF ) palifermin alloHSCT use unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell . - The primary objective phase II portion determine incidence chronic GVHD addition palifermin TMS ( tacrolimus , methotrexate sirolimus ) base GVHD prophylaxis deliver identical fashion NCI 07-C-0195 study . Eligibility : - Adults ( 18 - 70 year ) advance high risk hematologic malignancy ( include AML , ALL , MDS , CLL , NHL , HL , CML , multiple myeloma , MPN ) lack suitable HLA-matched sibling donor . - An unrelated donor match minimum 8 allele ( HLA-A , -B , -C , DRB1 ) high-resolution typing , identify National Marrow Donor Program . - Karnofsky great equal 60 acceptable organ function . Design : - Patients receive disease-specific induction chemotherapy ( EPOCH-F/R FLAG ) prior transplant need disease control immune depletion . - All patient receive identical conditioning regimen consist cyclophosphamide 1200 mg/m^2/day IV 4 day fludarabine 30 mg/m^2/day 4 day ( transplant day -6 -3 ) . - All patient receive peripheral blood stem cell product unrelated donor match HLA-A , -B , -C , -DRB1 ( 8/8 ) high-resolution typing . - Palifermin administer phase 1 , open label design follow propose schedule : - Dose level 1 : 180 mcg/kg day -7 - Dose level 2 : 360 mcg/kg day -7 - Dose level 3 : 540 mcg/kg day -7 - Dose level 4 : 720 mcg/kg day -7 - The phase I portion conduct standard 3+3 design ; maximum possible number patient accrue portion 24 . - The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) phase I portion study use conduct phase II study . Total accrual phase II study 27 patient , include 3-6 patient treat MTD phase I portion study</detailed_description>
