	<brief_summary>Evaluating efficacity new device phototherapy compare conventional phototherapy . Jaundice occur many newborn , , case benign , However , owe potential neurotoxicity unconjugated bilirubin , newborn must monitor identify might develop severe hyperbilirubinemia , rare case , acute bilirubin encephalopathy kernicterus . Treatment jaundice newborn relies phototherapy , expose skin light specific wavelength . Fluorescent tubes halogen lamp use light source phototherapy many year . Light-emitting diode ( LEDs ) recent source power efficient , long life portable low heat production . Several technology device develop use LEDs specially compact system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Phototherapy Device Treat Patients With Crigler-Najjar Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crigler-Najjar ( CN ) syndrome congenital inborn error hepatic bilirubin metabolism cause deficiency bilirubin uridinediphosphate glucuronosyltransferase activity CN patient permanent risk life-threatening bilirubin encephalopathy ( kernicterus ) . Treatment CN disease relies daily prolong phototherapy ( 10-12 h/day ) . To date , liver transplantation curative treatment available . To date , phototherapy device exist teenager adult . CN patient use homemade system add several neonatal system together reach good efficacy . A new device design weave optical fiber sheet connect LEDs . This new technology , market several manufacturer phototherapy device , use pediatric ward treat jaundiced newborn . A prototype 80Ã— 100cm thus develop , combine numerous advantage : important surface treatment , easy use transportation , user-friendliness . Before go therapeutic trial assess benefit new device ambulatory current practice , essential make sure feasibility efficiency control bilirubinemia , medical supervision . Hypothesis : new phototherapy sheet effective , well tolerate usual device use CN patient .</detailed_description>
