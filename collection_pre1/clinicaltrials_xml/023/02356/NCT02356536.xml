	<brief_title>The Effect Wearable Cueing Device Freezing Gait Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CuePeD trial primarily involve use WCD ( picture website www.brightdevices.com.au ) . This belt worn device , co-location motion sensor input cue output . The input mediate miniaturized accelerometer gyroscope utilizes software algorithm develop detect FOG . The cueing output mediate laser light shine floor front user continuous visual signal . The cue produce device 's ability recognize FOG user . The laser produce predetermined period time normal gait recommence , time extinguishes next freeze episode . This study plan examine effectiveness WCD problem FOG PD 'in vivo ' , , community setting . FOG define narrowly 'the sudden inability initiate sustain locomotion ' . It include 'start ' , 'turn ' 'destination ' hesitation . A broad definition accept 2010 workshop clinician scientist interested FOG `` brief , episodic absence mark reduction forward progression foot despite intention walk '' . It generally occur several year onset PD recognize significant source morbidity PD patient . Cueing represent one promising treatment , demonstration vivo effectiveness intervention date , modest . Falls , often multifactorial general population , PD often attributable FOG . Unfortunately , current treatment FOG largely ineffective , evidence use limit . Interventions FOG usually pharmacological involve manipulation laevodopa ( LD ) dose , recently , addition stimulant . Other centrally act medication describe anecdotally beneficial , systematically study . Possibly consequence decrease postoperative laevodopa ( LD ) dose chronic user , recognize significance subthalamic nucleus ( common stimulation target ) gait regulation , rise Deep Brain Stimulation treatment PD may contribute problem . The first study employ wearable device detect FOG describe Bachlin 2010 , involve 3 component device ( ankle wear motion sensor , belt worn processing unit earpiece cue output ) pulse auditory cue ( 1 Hz click sound ) . One recur difficulty gait scientist inability elicit FOG freezer ' vitro ' laboratory . This due artificial clinical environment give rise 'best performance ' 'paradoxical kinesia ' . Non-laboratory , 'in vivo ' measure limit user rat questionnaire end trial period home use . This freeze detecting , cue produce device offer elegant solution amelioration FOG possibly fall PD population day day life . In addition , offer novel opportunity objective measurement kinematic data ass efficacy device individual subject . Whilst cue recognize treatment FOG 25 year , work occur gait laboratory . It well know FOG induce many subject initiation gait , turn 'dual task ' . This commonly occur domestic environment , small space doorway , hallway etc . Most 'in vitro ' work take place fix , pulse cue , usually auditory , include visual somatosensory/vibration pulse . Unfortunately , landmark 2006 RESCUE trial Neiubauer demonstrate improvement gait sustain cue device remove . That , problem FOG readily rehabilitate cueing , benefit cue train quickly extinguish treatment finish . The neurobiology FOG occur setting , beyond scope description , begin understood , worthy brief commentary good understand WCD 's mechanism action . Several line evidence , include functional imaging study point failure reconciliation motor , cognitive emotional circuit FOG prone patient . Mental task ( count backwards ) , additional motor task ( carry glass water ) , well feel severe anxiety induce FOG . The presence doorway kitchen bench , require contemplation , similarly represent dual task challenge induce FOG . Being optimally emotionally aroused laboratory set assist overcome propensity freeze . The propose research case series analysis 30 PD patient clinically significant FOG ; recruit local movement disorder neurologist . There blind . There ABA design subject act control - device continually , FOG episodes different time period . There randomization 3 device setting different time period . Each trial take 2 week , initial gait laboratory assessment . During assessment signature freeze episode capture , videoed , patient , correlate kinematic reading . identification FOG episodes Inter-rater reliability data obtain assessment . Patients become familiar use device later use home . 3 task undertaken patient device set - ie 9 task total - include : timed go , 2 minute walk specifically design obstacle course . A battery psychometric instrument complete . This assessment follow 2 week home trial . 3 device setting employ environment - 1. device 'off ' simply measure FOG use software algorithm , 2.the device `` '' whereby FOG episodes trigger laser cue , 3. device 'continually ' whereby , continuous visual cue emit device , independent FOG episode . The device settings 1,2 3 3,7 4 day respectively , randomisation order setting 2 3 . During 2 week home trial , Kinematic data capture FOG duration log device time period day device different setting . Fall data collect 6am 10pm . Crucially , FOG episodes 3 setting device record . The primary outcome measure total second FOG device simply record compare total FOG second FOG dependent ( continuous FOG independent ) cue provide device . At end 7 day set 2 ( FOG dependent cue ) , instrument rating complete second time , return device collation data . Whilst cue recognize treatment FOG 25years , work occur gait laboratory . It well know FOG induce many subject initiation gait , turn 'dual task ' . This commonly occur domestic environment , small space doorway , hallway etc . One hypothesis regard limited efficacy confer current device use FOG , pulse , fixed auditory stimuli represent cognitive burden may actually induce FOG initial freeze overcome . The work Wolpert would suggest pulsed auditory cue extend beyond freeze episode would best 'gated ' subject , essentially ignore . Bachlin 's subject complain auditory cue annoy . A fixed visual cue extinguishes freeze broken appeal powerful antidote paradox focus patient 's attention point freezing , add cognitive burden freeze broken . This recognize first description cue FOG invert walk cane . It powerful example curiosity paradoxical kinesia well know disorder , easily forget clinician witness . Until recent development increasingly miniaturize , sophisticated accelerometer gyroscope , mechanism replicate effect upturned cane hold walk companion . It known increase loss automaticity FOG patient , increase cortical connectivity deep brain structure - , seem 'cortical takeover ' gait patient . It seem likely cue may readily enable re-accessing 'vestigial ' gait motor program patient help . The 2 null hypothesis research project : ( 1 ) That wearable , freeze detect cue device measurable effect total freeze duration , total number freeze episode , total number fall three 1 hour interval measure separate day subject Parkinson 's disease ; : ( 2 ) That difference user rat instrument measure Quality Life , Freezing Gait , Falls , Anxiety Depression 2 week treatment wearable , freeze detect cue device patient Parkinson 's disease . The propose research case series analysis 30 PD patient clinically significant FOG ; recruit local movement disorder neurologist . There blind . In arm trial , ABA design subject act control - device different time period . The assessment include : 1 . Freezing Gait Questionnaire ( FOGQ ) ; Falls Efficacy Scale ( FES ) ; Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire 39 ; Geriatric Anxiety Inventory ( GAI ) , Geriatric depression scale ( GDS ) ; Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) ; Mini mental state examination MMSE MOCA . 2 . 2minute walk test ; Timed 'up go ' test ; Dual tasking Timed go test ; standardize 20 metre obstacle course include doorway , corridor , 180 360 degree turn . Patients ask take WCD home 14 day clear guideline use . The battery questionnaires complete end 14 day , along self address postal pack return device accompany patient .</detailed_description>
