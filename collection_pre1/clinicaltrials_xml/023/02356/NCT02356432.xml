	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction Anticoagulants generally recognize necessary therapy prevent recurrence ischemic stroke patient non-valvular atrial fibrillation ( NVAF ) , patient also cause bleeding , particularly intracranial hemorrhage ( include intracerebral hemorrhage ) . One independent predictor intracerebral hemorrhage presence cerebral microbleeds ( CMBs ) ; high incidence intracerebral hemorrhage report patient multiple CMBs ( Soo et al , J Neurol , 2008 ; Lee et al , Neurology , 2009 ) Also , rate absolute number CMBs increase proportion CHADS2 score patient cerebral infarction accompany NVAF ( Song et al , Eur J Neurol , 2013 ) . Among CMB-positive patient , high incidence intracranial hemorrhage associate oral anticoagulation therapy report ( Song et al , Eur J Neurol , 2013 ) ; suggest relationship occurrence absolute number CMBs development intracranial hemorrhage oral anticoagulation therapy . Imaizumi et al . ( J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis , 2013 ) find warfarin alone increase incidence intracerebral hemorrhage subject CMBs , subject 3 deep CMBs show increase incidence . Also , meta-analysis conduct Lovelock et al . ( Stroke , 2010 ) demonstrate high incidence CMBs patient intracerebral hemorrhage receive warfarin patient intracerebral hemorrhage receive antithrombotic therapy . Recently , Orken et al ( Clin Neurol Neurosurg , 2013 ) suggest patient CMBs baseline develop new CMBs 2 year ( 26 % ) , compare patient ( 12 % ) CMBs baseline ( p=0.03 ) . However , study progression CMBs patient receive so-called novel oral anticoagulant ( NOACs ) . NOACs , include dabigatran ( Hart et al , Stroke 2012 ) , rivaroxaban ( Patel et al , N Engl J Med 2011 ) , apixaban ( Granger CB et al , N Engl J Med 2011 ) , edoxaban ( Giugliano et al , N Engl J Med 2013 ) , superior warfarin prevent stroke systemic embolism patient NVAF , report significantly reduce incidence hemorrhagic stroke . Therefore , study design evaluate compare absolute number CMBs patient least one CMB baseline , receive anticoagulant therapy NOACs warfarin . The correlation CMBs intracranial hemorrhage , well status CMBs commencement treatment progression treatment , evaluate determine whether difference two group . 2 . The feature study Japan high availability MRI facility , thus CMBs readily evaluate multiple patient use T2*WI . As January 1 , 2013 , total population Kanagawa Prefecture 9.07 million , elderly ( ≥65 year ) comprise 1.95 million ; therefore , clinical observational study cover prefecture reveal significant difference NOACs warfarin substantial impact drug-prescribing practice . CMBs find T2*-weighted gradient-echo MRI 1.5 Tesla evaluate . The image data evaluate Cerebral Microbleeds Evaluation Committee use assessment scale Gregoire et al . blind condition . 3 . Study design This study test hypothesis incidence hemorrhagic stroke low patient receive NOACs receive warfarin , difference reflect difference effect warfarin NOACs progression CMBs patient least one CMB . This study observational study , number patient NOACs warfarin group predetermine , though total number patient study limited 200 practical reason . Primary endpoint proportion subject increase number CMBs Month 12 treatment NOACs warfarin . If result study support efficacy NOACs prevent increase CMBs , would great interest domestic overseas clinician , view potential therapeutic impact , include primary prevention ischemic stroke . For quality assurance , data validation registry procedure include plan site monitoring audit perform . 4 . Sample Size Sample Size Justification Orken et al . ( Clin Neurol Neurosurg , 2013 ) suggest patient CMBs baseline develop new CMBs ( 26 % ) 2 year , compare patient ( 12 % ) CMBs baseline . Therefore , rate new CMBs warfarin-treated patient least one CMB baseline assume 13 % 1-year follow-up . Meanwhile , ENGAGE AF-TIMI study , incidence intracranial hemorrhage among patient receive edoxaban ( one NOACs ) half patient receive warfarin ; rate appearance new CMBs assume 6.5 % . Simulations ( 10,000 time ) indicate probability rank order rate newly develop CMBs 1 year would reverse two group 92.7 % ( power : 19 % , two-sided α= 0.05 ) . As pilot study , number necessary subject estimate 100 subject 1 group 200 2 group combine , base result . 5 . Statistical Analysis plan For proportion new CMBs month 6 month 12 , number new CMBs month 6 12 , location CMBs , major analysis conduct accord per protocol set ( PPS ) principle . In addition , incidence rate adverse event , major analysis conduct accord intention treat ( ITT ) principle . As primary endpoint analysis ( proportion new CMBs month 12 ) , NOACs group warfarin group compare respect total CMBs positive proportion . It ' also compare NOACs group warfarin group respective secondary endpoint ( proportion new CMBs month 6 , number new CMBs month 6 12 , location CMBs , incidence rate adverse event ) . Proportion subject increase number CMBs month 12 compare among NOACs . As need arises , comparison among NOACs , stratify factor patient background , treatment content etc. , analyze .</detailed_description>
