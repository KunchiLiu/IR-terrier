	<brief_summary>Background : Data scarce concern inject drug use ( IDU ) alcohol consumption among HIV-infected people highly active antiretroviral treatment ( HAART ) Cameroon . The aim study determine prevalence alcohol consumption IDU among HIV-infected people HAART ; determine sociodemographic factor associate alcohol abuse IDU among people HAART ; determine impact alcohol consumption IDU adherence HAART . Methods/Design : The investigator conduct cross sectional study Yaoundé Central Hospital Cameroon , February August 2015 . Using self-report questionnaire , investigator include least 1,000 HIV-infected adult ( 18 year ) HAART least one month come HIV care . The investigator exclude pregnant woman . Data collection include sociodemographic economic profile , alcohol consumption use Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test , inject drug use , adherence HAART use visual analog scale self-rate report . The investigator perform sub-analysis sex group area habitation . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Discussion : There critical need accurate estimate amplitude distribution IDU alcohol consumption among HIV-infected adult , order inform health policy maker curb burden inject drug use alcohol consumption among people live HIV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction 1.1 . Background In low middle income country , 28.6 million people eligible antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) base 2013 guideline around 10 million currently ART . Cameroon lower-middle-income country prevalence human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection adult 4.3 % 2011 . In year , coverage antiretroviral therapy adult child 49.6 % , demonstrate immensity work do achieve goal good ART coverage . The considerable expansion access HIV treatment world change epidemic HIV infection . The importance ART well establish . Life expectancy adult receive ART approximately 80 % normal life expectancy . The preventive effect ART increasingly evident , even case HIV epidemic concentrate . There exist link alcohol consumption infectious disease , deleterious effect alcohol disease progression . In Cameroon , general population , adult ( 15+ year ) per caput alcohol consumption 13.74 litter pure alcohol . Heavy episodic drink 8.4 % 2.1 % respectively among male female Cameroon general population . Alcohol binge drinking find 11.6 % people live HIV ART 20.6 % interrupted treatment . Binge drinking define male consumption 5 drink , female consumption 4 drink , 2 hour . Alcohol use disorder screen cut , annoyance criticism , guilty feeling , eye-openers ( cage ) questionnaire present among 17 % adult HIV-infected Cameroon . In Cameroon , prevalence non-adherence ART 22.5 % base Community Programs Clinical Research AIDS index 34.9 % base Centre Adherence Support Evaluation index . Alcohol one main factor ART interruption ART non-adherence . The consumption alcohol ART decrease response highly active ART , decrease health relate quality life . In general , health data , include HIV prevalence data , less robust key population general population due complexity sample ( lack size estimation data ) , legal concern issue stigma discrimination . To date , study inject drug user Cameroon , even sub-Sahara Africa scarce among HIV-infected people . The estimation show 2012 worldwide 12.7 million people recently inject drug , , 13.1 % living HIV . 1.2 . Study rationale With demonstrated burden harmful alcohol consumption inject drug use ( IDU ) among people live HIV , necessary measure weight alcohol consumption IDU among HIV-infected adult HAART ; understand HIV-infected people consume alcohol use inject drug HAART Cameroon , sub-Saharan Africa country ; assess impact alcohol consumption IDU adherence ART . 2 . Study objectives The aim study ( 1 ) determine describe prevalence alcohol consumption IDU among HIV-infected people HAART ; ( 2 ) determine sociodemographic factor associate alcohol consumption IDU among people HAART ; ( 3 ) determine impact alcohol consumption IDU adherence HAART . 3 . Methods 3.1 . Design The investigator use cross-sectional design . The recruitment participant conduct January June 2015 . Socio-demographic data , adherence ART , alcohol consumption self-reported patient questionnaire , patient ask clarification he/she understood question . The investigator follow STROBE guideline report study . 3.2 . Setting Cameroon sub-Saharan central Africa country , divide ten region population 19,406,100 inhabitant 2011 . The adult prevalence rate HIV country 4.3 % . In Yaoundé , capital Cameroon , site recruitment , adult prevalence rate HIV infection 6.4 % ( 3.6 % men 8.9 % woman ) . Subjects recruit Day Hospital Yaoundé Central Hospital . It large HIV clinic country . This urban center heart Yaoundé city . 3.3 . Participants The investigator include study subject age 18 year HAART least one month . The investigator exclude pregnant woman . Informed consent prerequisite participate study , provide verbally . 3.4 . Data collection 3.4.1 . Sociodemographic profile The investigator collect age , gender , sexual orientation , last level education , monthly household income , area habitation , number person household , mode healthcare payment , marital status , employment status , probable route HIV infection , disclosure HIV status . 3.4.2 . Alcohol consumption The investigator use Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT ) identify subject at-risk , hazardous , harmful drinking . AUDIT possible range 0 40 . A score ≤ 7 classify current problem ( low risk drinking ) , score range 8 - 15 classify probable current problem drinking ( risky hazardous drinking ) , score range 16 - 19 classified high risk harmful drinking , score ≥ 20 define harm likely alcohol dependent . The investigator prefer use self-reported questionnaire vs. interview questionnaire may produce accurate answer , patient well understand question , could ask clarification . The investigator therefore use AUDIT screen instrument test classify current drinker problem non-problem drinker cut-off ≥ 8 . Sensitivity specificity AUDIT respectively 51 % -97 % 78 % -96 % . The investigator define current drinker , patient consume alcohol last 12 month . 3.4.3 . Adherence antiretroviral therapy The investigator use several method measure adherence ART : linear visual analogue scale ( VAS ) past month self-rate adherence ART last month use scale ' 1 - good ' ' 5 - bad ' . 3.4.4 . Injecting drug use Patients report Yes No , already use injectable drug . If yes , give frequency last time use . 3.5 . Statistical analysis 3.5.1 . Sample size The sample calculation base alcohol consumption , data IDU Cameroon among HIV-infected people . The investigator assume alcohol abuse among adult HIV-infected 17 % . With 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) , acceptable difference 5 % ; minimal required sample size 217 adult HIV-infected ART . The investigator use Windows Program Epidemiologist ( WinPepi , version 11.43 ) estimate require sample size . Because investigator use self-reported questionnaire , investigator suppose 20 % miss data . Therefore , minimal require sample size 272 male 272 female alcohol consumption different sex ( 14 ) . The investigator hope sample 1,000 patient high power study . 3.5.2 . Statistical method Data cod , enter , analyze use Statistical Package Social Science version 20.0 Windows ( IBM Corp . Released 2011 . IBM SPSS Statistics Windows , Version 20.0 . Armonk , New York : IBM Corp. ) . The investigator describe continuous variable use mean standard deviation use median interquartile range , categorical variable use frequency percentage . For test , use 2-sided p-values alpha &lt; 0.05 level significance . The investigator use χ² test equivalent categorical variable , Student T test mean , Mann-Whitney U test median . Null hypothesis difference reject 95 % CI odds ratio ( OR ) estimate excluded 1 . All regression analysis conduct stepwise forward method entry model p value ≤ 0.2 . Multiple imputation use handle miss data , create new data set average five data set imputed value . The investigator impute socio-demographic data regression analysis . 4 . Ethical consideration The study conduct accordance Helsinki Declaration . Prior enrolment , eligible participant provide verbal consent . Patients alcohol consumption , inject drug use and/or non-adherence ART receive counseling address problem accord WHO recommendation . 5 . Discussion The expansion use ART help make HIV infection chronic disease . One major challenge overcome effective use ARVs improve outcome people live HIV . Consumption alcohol inject drug patient HAART may obstacles . The scientific evidence already do first negative effect antiretroviral therapy others people Africa study IDU do , particularly Africa . Even data alcohol consumption antiretroviral therapy exist Africa , study large sample size . More best best knowledge , almost study prevalence inject drug use among HIV infect people Africa , particularly Cameroon . With study , gap knowledge inject drug alcohol effect adherence antiretroviral therapy may address . This guide future research . This knowledge also provide clinician policy maker health , light implementation guideline improve outcomes people live HIV context . One limitation might emerge implementation study presence miss data , particularly relate data collection study patient . It nonetheless necessary use form data collection , since collect data adherence ARV treatment , alcohol consumption , inject drug use . In general , people tend underestimate alcohol consumption overestimate adherence treatment third party ask question . In addition , use drug prohibit law . Some patient may therefore deny consumption . This name contact ask , signature write consent participation study require study . We thus use verbal consent . The final report study form scientific paper publish peer-reviewed journal . Findings present conference submit relevant health authority .</detailed_description>
