	<brief_summary>The objective study investigate safety function collagen Matrix 10808 human compare versus standard therapy , transplantation autologous connective tissue graft . The Collagen Matrix develop soft tissue augmentation . It three dimensional porous Matrix consist mainly Collagen I III . Study patient must single tooth gap insufficient soft tissue volume implant placement . Therefore soft tissue augmentation necessary .</brief_summary>
