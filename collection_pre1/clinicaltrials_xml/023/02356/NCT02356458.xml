	<brief_title>Combination Ibrutinib Bortezomib Treat Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disease background , therapy background aim Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) distinct subtype B-cell lymphoma . It represent ~5 % lymphoma typically present advanced stage , median age 60-65 year dismal prognosis median survival ~3 year . Currently , remain incurable , patient relapse first line treatment require subsequent therapy . The disease-free survival progressively short subsequent relapse . Currently , standard therapy relapse MCL patient . MCL predominantly disease elderly suitable aggressive chemotherapy . Allogeneic transplant preferred young fit patient , whereas ( preferably single agent ) chemotherapy use treat old patient , usually short duration response . Recently , therapeutic armamentarium expand availability novel agent target crucial deregulate pathway MCL . These include Bruton 's Kinase ( BTK ) inhibitor ibrutinib excellent single agent activity . New therapeutic option target patient population clearly need prolong remission especially elderly patient aggressive chemotherapy allogeneic transplant suitable treatment option . Recently , synergistic increase proteasomal inhibition ibrutinib bortezomib-sensitive refractory MCL cell show . This trial target patient diagnosis refractory relapse MCL disease pretreatment ≤2 line non-bortezomib-containing chemotherapy . The propose treatment ibrutinib combination bortezomib might lead improvement therapy target relapsed/refractory patient population . Given absence dose-limiting toxicity also apply long-term , ibrutinib well suit patient population maintenance therapy . Therefore , combination treatment trial follow maintenance therapy part patient disease progression . New treatment option control disease best long possible . Treatment Treatment consist 6 cycle 21 day ibrutinib combination bortezomib , follow maintenance therapy ibrutinib monotherapy . In maintenance therapy course repeat every 28-days absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Objectives Phase I The primary object trial establish recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) ibrutinib combination bortezomib patient relapse refractory MCL . The secondary objective - determine safety tolerability ibrutinib combination bortezomib - ass preliminary antitumor activity ibrutinib combination bortezomib Phase II The main object trial define efficacy combination treatment ibrutinib bortezomib patient relapse refractory MCL . The secondary objective - determine safety tolerability RP2D - ass efficacy ibrutinib combination bortezomib patient relapse MCL follow ibrutinib maintenance therapy .</detailed_description>
