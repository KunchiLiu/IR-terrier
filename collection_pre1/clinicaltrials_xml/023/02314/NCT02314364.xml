	<brief_summary>This research study study type radiation therapy call Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) possible treatment stage IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) mutate epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) displace anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase ( ALK ) ROS proto-oncogene 1 ( ROS1 ) gene ( = oncogene-driven NSCLC ) subject receive treatment target biological agent erlotinib , crizotinib , drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Integrating SBRT With Targeted Therapy Stage IV Oncogene-driven NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . The investigational intervention study SBRT proton photon radiation ( explain ) . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . SBRT proton radiation therapy FDA approve radiation delivery system . However , use treatment stage IV NSCLC still investigational . SBRT specialize , technologically advanced type external beam radiation therapy pinpoint high dos radiation directly cancer . Because high precision , treatment spare healthy tissue associate few side effect . SBRT different conventional therapy radiation deliver small dos give daily course several week . For SBRT , total dose radiation typically administer 4-5 daily session . SBRT deliver standard , call photon radiation , proton beam . Neither two type radiation generally superior . There technical difference two , depend tumor location , size , shape , factor , investigator decide type radiation use treatment . After screen procedure confirm eligible participate research study : - Each participant receive stereotactic treatment course ( SBRT proton photon ) area tumor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) actionable mutation translocation EGFR , ALK , ROS1 Stage IV disease ( AJCC Staging system 7th edition ) Within 6 month initiate first TKI treatment regimen Stable respond systemic disease TKI ( evidence progression ) recent stag study . The complete extent current residual systemic disease must deem amenable SBRT per review image study radiation oncologist , base follow criterion : Lung : 13 lesion ( include primary ) maximum size 5 cm long diameter . A minimum size 1 cm long diameter recommend . ( Patients malignant pleural effusion prior start TKI therapy consider eligible SBRT complete radiographic resolution effusion systemic therapy ) ; Spine : Bone lesion must limit spine . A maximum 2 spinal metastasis consider SBRT , site span 13 vertebral body . A minimum size 1 cm long diameter recommend . SBRT may target sclerotic lesion persist follow TKI therapy ; GI : 14 liver metastasis maximum size 5 cm long diameter and/or 12 adrenal metastasis maximum 4 cm size long diameter . A minimum size 1 cm long diameter recommend . In addition : CNS : 14 brain metastasis maximum size 3cm long diameter . However , treat standardofcare SRS define target lesion purpose protocol . A maximum number 5 target lesion outside brain , exclude lung primary , recommend ensure enrollment limited patient lowburden disease treatment deliver within specified time frame . History prior radiation therapy brain skeleton allow , occur &gt; 2 month enrollment . Age least 18 year . Life expectancy great 6 month . ECOG performance status â‰¤ 2 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A negative serum urine pregnancy test within 2 week registration woman childbearing potential require . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Residual hilar mediastinal lymph node disease ( size &gt; 1cm shortaxis diameter CT ) . Nonmalignant etiology enlarge lymph node may evaluate per standard clinical practice . Participants receive prior radiation therapy anatomical site brain skeleton . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients pacemaker defibrillatordependent device may operate concurrently delivery proton beam radiation . Pregnant lactate woman , treatment involve unforeseeable risk embryo fetus .</criteria>
