	<detailed_description>Globally , overweight obesity significant public health issue affect 40 million child age five 2011 . There broad agreement around aetiology childhood overweight obesity risk factor identify prenatally , pregnancy early infancy . Clearly , point view infant , risk factor present prenatally pregnancy non-modifiable identify infancy potentially modifiable . Between 25 % -33 % infant gain weight rapidly desirable first 6 month life strong risk factor childhood overweight 3 year . Rapid weight gain potentially modifiable intervention facilitate well infant diet , feeding practice exposure physical activity . To facilitate identification infant might great risk develop childhood overweight obesity number model develop . The Infant Risk Obesity Checklist ( IROC ) develop research team use data Millennium Cohort Study ( MCS ) Avon Longitudinal Study Parents Children ( ALSPAC ) potentially screen infant 4 month age risk factor childhood overweight obesity 3 year . However , yet test clinical practice . Concerns express use tool develop epidemiological literature identify overweight obesity risk effective evidence-based intervention affect . There evidence complex intervention target diet feeding deliver parent infant &lt; 2 year old show positive intervention effect feed practice physical activity , although many intervention tackle psycho-emotional aspect feed underpinned behavioural change theory . The impact weight outcomes less certain , case may due intervention component behaviour change technique target parent rather infant level . Universal eligibility overweight obesity prevention costly may unnecessary low baseline risk . However , target certain group overweight obesity prevalent ( example , low socio-economic status , minority ethnic group ) raise concern around stigmatisation . Preliminary work parents/legal guardians/carers suggest target may appropriate provide person convey information appropriate knowledge sensitivity . suggest novel approach discussion need . Digital technology use provide information patient health care relate area . The finding recent review suggest interactive multimedia programme capacity facilitate communication health professional patient , research field need . A pragmatic research design plan three link phase . The first involved development interactive multimedia programme , namely ProActive Assessment Overweight Risk Infancy ( ProAsk ) include IROC therapeutic wheel , facilitate health professional ' discussion parents/legal guardians/carers overweight risk prevention infancy . This phase feasibility study ProAsk intervention parents/legal guardians/carers health professional . The study gather information inform trial design data collection procedure Randomised Controlled Trial ( RCT ) overweight risk identification intervention infancy UK health visit team . The third phase conduct end feasibility trial .Qualitative work undertaken determine acceptability utility ProAsk health professional work health visit team parents/legal guardians/carers .</detailed_description>
