	<brief_summary>The investigator wish monitor adoption new , incisionless approach perform Heller myotomy surgical treatment achalasia . The method , Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy ( POEM ) , provide less-invasive treatment esophageal achalasia , ideally provide similar well outcome ( safety efficacy ) Heller myotomy . The investigator hope enroll 10 patient clinical diagnosis achalasia meet inclusion criterion . The POEM procedure do many hospital without research associate . Dr. Ginsberg , Dr. Chandrasekhara Dr. Kochman perform procedure train . Dr. Ginsberg personally witness performance 10 POEM procedure perform swine model . The PI credentialed initiate POEM HUP first case proctor experienced operator . The PI proctor adopter . The investigator would like evaluate safety effectiveness . The investigator use symptom score radiology test pre- post-POEM evaluate effectiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy ( POEM ) Esophageal Motility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An esophageal motility disorder muscular contraction become discoordinated weak interfere movement food esophagus . Some esophageal motility disorder persist long enough cause severe problem require surgical intervention . Achalasia , one subtype esophageal motility disorder rare disease , define esophageal sphincter muscle unable relax dilate . Left untreated , symptom difficulty swallowing , regurgitation , heartburn , chest pain may easily turn complication severe weight loss , malnutrition , cough , pulmonary infection , pneumonia , perforation esophagus . Diagnosis esophageal achalasia determine esophageal manometry and/or barium swallow esophagram . Treatment achalasia include balloon dilation , botulinum toxin injection surgical intervention . Balloon dilation perform insert balloon esophageal sphincter , inflate balloon , disrupt esophageal muscle . Botox also know successfully relax spastic muscle contraction achalasia direct injection esophageal muscle . Unfortunately , alternative surgical treatment often require repeat administration improve symptom achalasia . Traditional treatment achalasia include open abdominal thoracic surgical procedure cut valve muscle esophagus stomach ( Heller Myotomy ) . Laparoscopic multi-port Heller myotomies become preferred approach , require 4 small abdominal incision placement laparoscope equipment . Results laparoscopic technique proven although 2/3 patient population successfully treat , subset group still need repeat surgical procedure balloon dilation . Recently , single-incision laparoscopic Heller myotomy produce favorable result , single umbilical incision preferential multiple-incision laparoscopy . We propose adoption new , incisionless approach perform Heller myotomy surgical treatment achalasia . The method , Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy ( POEM ) expect provide less-invasive treatment esophageal achalasia , ideally provide similar well outcomes Heller myotomy adopt safely effectively Penn Medicine .</detailed_description>
