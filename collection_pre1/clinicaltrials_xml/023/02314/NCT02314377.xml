	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Therapy Brain Arteriovenous Malformation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain AVMs relatively rare , though potential ICH along existence effective treatment make diagnosis management essential community . The 2-4 % annual incidence secondary ICH create controversy regard treatment asymptomatic patient . Brain AVMs thus require multidisciplinary evaluation optimal management especially surgical grade III - V lesion often require combination embolization , microsurgery , and/or radiosurgical treatment . Currently designate medical therapy bAVM , though grow animal human evidence support role bevacizumab reduce size AVMs brain liver , respectively . This proposal pilot study assess efficacy safety bevacizumab human bAVMs .</detailed_description>
