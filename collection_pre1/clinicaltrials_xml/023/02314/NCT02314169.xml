	<brief_title>Nivolumab Treating Patients With Refractory Metastatic Anal Canal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) nivolumab patient previously treat metastatic squamous cell carcinoma ( SCCA ) anal canal . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) nivolumab patient previously treat metastatic SCCA anal canal . II . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) patient previously treat metastatic SCCA anal canal treat nivolumab . III . To evaluate grade 3 4 toxicity rate patient previously treat metastatic SCCA anal canal treat nivolumab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate ORR , PFS , OS base expression program cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) , program cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) , peritumoral cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8+ tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) , peritumoral CD4+ TILs , regulatory T cell analyze tumor biopsy previously treat patient metastatic SCCA anal canal treat nivolumab . II . To evaluate radiographic response accord relative change proportion anti-human papillomavirus ( HPV ) specific CD8+ CD4+ TILs regulatory T cell patient previously treat metastatic SCCA anal canal follow treatment nivolumab , analyze serial peripheral blood sample . OUTLINE : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) approximately 60 minute every two week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 100 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
