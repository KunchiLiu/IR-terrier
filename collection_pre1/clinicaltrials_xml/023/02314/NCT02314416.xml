	<detailed_description>Wounds widespread problem around world . From practical purpose , wound divide acute chronic . Acute wind management depend amount type tissue destruction . Therefore , acute wound could furthermore subdivided simple wound skin miss complex wound underlie structure involve . Complex wound may require free flap wound bed poorly vascularize , devascularized underlying tissue would n't accept skin graft biologically derive extracellular matrix ( BDEM ) . Simple wound , hand , would manage past skin graft local flap feasible . These management strategy commonly result unacceptable aesthetically and/or functionally ( e.g . contracture , unstable wound ) outcomes often require secondary reconstruction . The second class wound chronic wound . Chronic wound occur whenever normally well-orchestrated reparative process proceed sequential timely fashion hemostasis inflammation , proliferation remodeling . The process necessarily complicate delay many intrinsic extrinsic factor along way ( 1 ) . Acute chronic wound pose significant burden patient , healthcare professional , healthcare system , affect 15.5 million patient cost estimate $ 500 billion annually ( 2-3 ) . Based pathogenesis , four principle type chronic wound : venous ulcer , diabetic ulcer , arterial ischemic pressure ulcer . 1 . Venous ulcer usually occur leg , account majority wound , often affect elderly prior history deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) . Ulcers form eventually , cell keep rate degradation . 2 . Diabetic ulcer see diabetic patient develop ulcer several reason . Neuropathy micro-angiopathy quite common , change together reduced immunity set perfect storm tissue breakdown low extremity . Because factor , exacerbate impaired healing , even small cut bruise become dangerously infect . 3 . PAD , term cover array medical problem cause obstruction large artery arm leg . In advanced form PAD , critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) occur , lead cause low limb amputation . The Angiogenesis Foundation estimate 1.4 million people United States CLI , estimate 350,876 new case diagnose year ( 2 ) . 4 . Pressure ulcer comprise fourth major type wound . These typically occur people bedridden whose mobility severely limit . They cause loss blood circulation occur pressure tissue great perfusion pressure capillary , thereby cut circulation , render tissue ischemic . The combination anesthesia paralysis potent inducer tissue break . Data spinal cord unit Veterans Affairs Medical Centers show alarmingly high prevalence incidence pressure ulcer young soldier paralyze spinal cord injury . Over past decade , little improvement make reduce morbidity disability chronic wound ( 3 ) . The best available treatment chronic wound achieve 50 % heal rate often temporary , unacceptably high recurrence rate . Among many factor contribute `` stall '' wound heal process , impairment production cytokine local inflammatory cell fibroblast reduce angiogenesis crucial problem ( 4 ) . The introduction BDEMs improve wound care significantly year . The commonly use BDEM bovine derive collagen matrix . This bovine collagen matrix FDA approve wound care device comprise porous matrix cross-linked bovine tendon collagen glycosaminoglycan semi-permeable polysiloxane ( silicone layer ) . The collagen-glycosaminoglycan biodegradable matrix provide scaffold cellular invasion capillary growth ( 5 ) . The use bovine collagen matrix improve aesthetic functional outcome complex wound full thickness skin defect exposure underlying structure muscle , tendon , vessel nerve . Despite clinical benefit , significant problem exists due long period require vascularization regeneration , require 3 week per manufacturer . As result , increase cost wound management also decrease income potential quality life . As research advance field wound care , stem cell therapy emerge promising approach treatment acute chronic wound . It know bone marrow-derived stem cell ( BMSC ) multipotential stem cell capable differentiation numerous cell type include fibroblast , muscle , brain , cartilage ( 6 ) . Among cell find BMSCs group call mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) . MSCs stromal cell hold reserve ability self-renew also exhibit multilineage differentiation . MSCs also find fetal adult tissue isolate umbilical cord , endometrial polyp , adipose tissue , menstrual blood . Because readily available harvest various tissue , MSCs attractive choice experimental possible clinical application . Recent clinical observation small sample size study report accelerate heal difficult wound topical regional application mononuclear cell preparation autologous bone marrow . In rat model , application systemic local BMSCs result improve wound heal increase wound tensile strength , increase collagen , fast wound maturation ( 7 ) . However , bone marrow harvest painful , time require general anesthesia , occasionally feasible due debilitate state patient . It thus , extremely desirable use off-the-shelf , commercially available , allogeneic , mesenchymal stem cell . NuCel ( NutechMedical , Birmingham , AL USA ) FDA approve allograft contain MSCs derive human amnion amniotic fluid currently use different clinical setting include orthopedic surgery neurosurgery graft . Amnion-derived MSCs report high trans-differentiation angio-vasculogenic property ( 8 ) . NuCel stem cell immune privilege express major histo-compatibility complex class II low expression MHC class I compare adult bone marrow derive stem cell . NuCel contain five type collagen fibronectin factor involve wound heal process . Moreover , less ethically controversial due abundance waste placenta . Multiple study show pluripotent stem cell increase speed vascularization BDEM significantly decrease time BDEM maturation ( 6-8 ) . As result , potential application decrease cost wound management increase quality life . In summary , propose test definitively , safety effectiveness allogeneic MSCs , NuCel , promote heal acute chronic wound . NuCel consist special class human stem cell ability express range therapeutically relevant protein factor , well form multiple cell type . We propose pilot study conduct Georgia Regents University . It prospective , randomize , control trial aim generate Level I II evidence effectiveness amniotic stem cell use collagen matrix carrier enhance heal wound . The goal design current proposal establish practical protocol potential accelerate translation advance knowledge new standard care wound management , also safe , FDA approve , inexpensively accessible address press need today 's wound healing field . The main objective current proposal use amniotic MSC speed maturation integration collagen matrix wound bed shorten total time need wound heal . This potentially result save hundred million dollar healthcare system . The outcome proposal accelerate translation great medical capability patient use novel , safe creative intervention .</detailed_description>
