	<brief_summary>Prospective randomize single blind trial . Study population woman diagnose severe pre-eclampsia singleton pregnancy , 24+0 week 41+6 week gestational age . The purpose study evaluate effect Rosuvastatin severe preeclampsia resolution 48 hour delivery . After screen signing informed consent form , enter delivery room , randomization 1:1 carry . 50 woman treatment arm 50 control arm . Both group treat accord ACOG ( The American College Obstetricians Gynecologists follow clinical guideline relate delivery 39 week ) guideline . In addition , follow randomization experimental group treat Rosuvastatin 40mg administrate orally without food . Treatment carry within first hour follow delivery . Another dose give 24 hour first administration . Control group treat placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia disorder widespread vascular endothelial malfunction vasospasm occur 20 week ' gestation present late 4-6 week ' postpartum . It clinically define blood pressure ≥140 mmHg systolic ≥90 mmHg diastolic diagnose first time 20 week ' gestation together &gt; 300mg proteinuria/24 hour . The global incidence preeclampsia estimate 5-14 % pregnancy . Pre-eclampsia affect approximately 6-8 % pregnancy worldwide . Pre-eclampsia affect 3-5 % first time pregnancy , early severe pre-eclampsia occurs 1:200 pregnancy . Significant risk factor pre-eclampsia follow : Nulliparity , age &gt; 40 year , black race , family history , chronic renal disease , chronic hypertension , antiphospholipid syndrome , diabetes mellitus , multiple gestation high body mass index . Mild preeclampsia define presence hypertension ( BP ≥140/90 mm Hg ) 2 occasion , least 6 hour apart , without evidence end-organ damage . Severe preeclampsia define presence 1 follow symptom sign presence preeclampsia : mark elevation blood pressure ( &gt; 160/110 mmHg ) , severe proteinuria ( &gt; 5 g/24 hour ) , evidence central nervous system ( CNS ) dysfunction ( headache , blur vision , seizure , coma ) , renal dysfunction ( oliguria creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL ) , pulmonary edema , hepatocellular injury ( ALT &gt; 2-fold upper limit normal ) , hematologic dysfunction ( platelet count &lt; 100,000/L DIC ) , placental dysfunction ( oligohydramnios severe intrauterine growth restriction ) . The HELLP ( hemolysis , elevate liver enzyme , low platelet ) syndrome special subgroup severe preeclampsia major cause morbidity mortality . Eclampsia define seizure attributable cause woman preeclampsia . The optimal management woman preeclampsia depend gestational age disease severity Management preeclampsia challenge require clinician balance health mother fetus simultaneously . Patients mild preeclampsia often induce 37 week gestation . Before , immature fetus treat expectant management bed rest , close monitoring blood pressure renal function , careful fetal surveillance . For woman severe preeclampsia , induction delivery consider 34 week gestation unless patient eligible expectant management tertiary hospital setting . The definitive treatment preeclampsia delivery fetus placenta . Anti-hypertensive drug essential severe hypertension ( ≥160 mmHg systolic ≥110 mmHg diastolic ) reduce risk cerebrovascular accident . Intravenous Labetalol , Nifedipine hydralazine drug commonly use manage preeclampsia insignificant evidence indicate drug preferable.. Magnesium sulfate treatment choice prevention treatment eclamptic seizure Where immediate child-birth essential , delay 24 hour allow steroid give mature baby 's lung , although short duration may still benefit . Preeclampsia associate short-term long-term maternal fetal complication . For mother , may lead eclamptic seizure , stroke , intracranial bleed , uncontrolled hypertension , renal failure , hemolysis . For fetus , may lead intrauterine growth restriction , placental abruption , short-term long-term complication prematurity , well predisposition adult cardiovascular metabolic disorder . Currently , effective therapy preeclampsia , delivery remain approach prevent maternal morbidity mortality . However , usually achieve expense premature delivery associate morbidity . Moreover , follow delivery , preeclampsia resolve slowly within day , expose mother late complication increase treatment cost significantly . To date , exact etiology preeclampsia remain unknown . However , evidence obtain recent year , support theory angiogenic imbalance end common pathway lead clinical preeclampsia . During normal pregnancy , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) placental growth factor ( PlGF ) promote pro-angiogenic state regulates vascular tone glomerular capillary health . In preeclampsia , proteins antagonized excessive placental production soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 ( sFlt-1 ) , thereby create angiogenic imbalance . After delivery , imbalance resolve within hour day correlate resolution disease . One observation mark sFlt-1 key player pathogenesis preeclampsia make animal model . It demonstrate preeclampsia induce animal model express sFlt-1 alone . In model hydrophilic statins treatment decrease sFlt-1 level up-regulated VEGF PlGF level . Most importantly , statin ameliorate preeclampsia symptom improve hypertension proteinuria preeclamptic mouse . Statins potent inhibitor cholesterol biosynthesis use successfully primary secondary prevention coronary heart disease . Additionally , statin know mediate pleiotropic effect via improve endothelial function attenuate inflammatory response . Rosuvastatin hydrophilic statin , characterize low permeability membrane , placenta blood-brain-barrier . In addition , Short treatment ( hour day ) type statin improved outcome patient acute myocardial infarction , sepsis , contrast-induced nephropathy , hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury , emphasize preferential pleiotropic effect . Currently , food drug administration classiﬁes statins pregnancy category X discourage use pregnancy due high abortion rate teratogenicity observe animal expose hydrophobic statin pregnancy . Evidence teratogenicity hydrophilic statins never report probably due limited permeability across membrane . Since use statin delivery allow , present study aim evaluate whether Rosuvastatin may accelerate preeclampsia resolution follow delivery potentially reduce postpartum preeclampsia complication .</detailed_description>
