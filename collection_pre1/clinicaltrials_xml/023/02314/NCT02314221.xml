	<brief_summary>The primary objective study achieve successful walking skill use exoskeletal walking device course 36 session 3 month specific velocity distance people chronic SCI wheelchair dependent community mobility . The secondary objective determine amount exoskeletal walk effective improve bowel function body composition patient population . The exploratory objective address additional question concern retention non-retention positive change , effect increase physical activity intervention vagal tone , orthostatic tolerance , lipid profile , total testosterone , estradiol level , quality life ( QOL ) . A Phase III randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) perform use crossover design employ exoskeletal-assisted walking intervention . The experimental arm compare usual activity ( UA ) arm , control , 64 person chronic SCI ( &gt; 6 month post injury ) wheelchair-dependent outdoor mobility community . The WALK arm consist supervise exoskeletal-assisted walking training , three session per week ( 4-6 h/week ) 36 session second 12-week period . The UA arm consist identification usual activity participant , encouragement continue activity attention study team member throughout 12-week UA arm . These activity record weekly log . The investigator hypotheses 1 ) exoskeletal intervention successful training ambulatory skill patient population , 2 ) exoskeletal intervention well control group improve body composition , bowel function , metabolic parameter quality life population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design Research design : A Phase III randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) perform use crossover design employ exoskeletal-assisted walking intervention . The experimental arm compare usual activity ( UA ) arm , control , 64 person chronic SCI ( &gt; 6 month post injury ) wheelchair-dependent outdoor mobility community . Eligible participant randomize ( within site ) one two group 12 week ( three month ) : Group 1 ( n=32 ) receive exoskeletal-assisted walking ( WALK ) first 12 week crossover UA second 12 week ; Group 2 ( n=32 ) receive UA first 12 week cross-over WALK arm 12 week training . The WALK arm consist supervise exoskeletal-assisted walking training , three session per week ( 4-6 h/week ) 36 session second 12-week period . The UA arm consist identification usual activity participant , encouragement continue activity attention study team member throughout 12-week UA arm . These activity record weekly log . A fixed answer format use capture information . Rationale intervention study : This research design several advantage . Group 1 serve intervention follow-up assess retention non-retention change due intervention outcome variable . Group 2 serve lead-in ass stability outcome variable prior intervention . Additionally , tremendous variability SCI population difficulty case-control matching , cross-over design help control variability participant participant serve control . Veterans nonveterans SCI generally receive structure rehabilitation complete acute sub-acute phase rehabilitation . As , usual lifestyle activity choose control study . Dr. Spungen discuss optimal control exoskeletal-assisted walk program . She consult Chiefs several SCI Services VA non-VA rehabilitation hospital . A case-controlled , match RCT study would strongest two intervention : exoskeletal-assisted walking compare form physical activity robotically assist body weight support treadmill training ( Lokomat ) , body weight support treadmill training , arm ergometry etc . However , two consideration make type study feasible . One would extremely difficult case-control match independent variable within site , second participant would likely agree participate 50 % chance would get exoskeletal-assisted walking arm . In order control attention effect , participant UA arm keep weekly activity log contact phone call study team receive attention encouragement continue participation UA choice . In order control attention aspect type study , participant also make person twice monthly visit site UA arm . During visit , study team staff review UA log administers 10Q BFS BSS . Because achievement improve secondary medical outcome likely dependent ability walk exoskeleton , primary outcome achievement mobility skill exoskeletal device . It demonstrate large sample people SCI use device describe pilot data . Secondary outcome change fat mass bowel function . Exploratory outcome change cardiovascular autonomic measure quality life survey [ use newly validate SCI quality life ( SCI-QOL ) tool bowel , bladder five emotional domain ] 21,50 . Description walk ReWalk : The ReWalk exoskeletal system require user actively shift body appropriately legs order maintain balance stance leg allow swing leg clear floor . This accomplish coordinated movement involve upper extremity muscle trunk , arm , shoulder , back , neck , head body maintain balance dynamically system assist legs move normal walking pattern . Balance maintain use Loftstrand crutch . A mode selector , worn wrist , use select `` walk mode '' person stable standing . Following walk mode selection , user shift onto leave leg slightly forward right leg offload . The tilting/leaning action trigger device swing right leg forward user weight shift trunk right leg step onto right foot . This initiate leave leg swing forward ; use weight shift onto continuous walk achieve coordinated weight shift step onto leg continue . The unit stop walking two way . If user shift weight onto front foot , ReWalk time two second return stand position . The second way person shift weight appropriately swing leg clear floor . This cause leg additional external force ReWalk sense cause system return stand mode . The step walk gait pattern ReWalk similar normal walking51 . The gait pattern setting ReWalk preset order increase decrease step length , speed step and/or amount foot clearance person walk , permit velocity 0.10 0.80 m/s . In order successfully accomplish walking ReWalk , considerable coordination upper extremity muscle trunk , arm , shoulder , back , neck , head need conjunction dynamic stand balance . A specific pattern trunk positioning , crutch placement weight shift need . To prepare walk , user must attain stable stand position crutch place slightly front him/her . To begin walk , user must shift weight onto left foot unweight right foot . The right foot step forward first , initiate user slightly lean forward , bring crutch forward , away step leg allow swing forward clear floor . As step leg move forward extend toward ground , user shift weight forward , step onto leg sequentially bring crutch forward next step . Immediately weight shift , user must straighten his/her posture body perpendicular ground lean forward initiate next step . This similar normal walking pattern . As leg contralateral initial step leg swing forward , participant must shift crutch away leg allow step forward . This process repeat continued walking . Description walk Ekso : The user progress series step participate ground ambulation . The first method , call FirstStep . This trainer trigger step use controller verbally cue participant device take step . The second method , call ActiveStep user initiate step action press button pair instrument crutch step . The last method , call ProStep , user shift weight lateral forward onto front foot , sensor indicate appropriate shift perform . The step pattern adjust change step time step length . The trajectory foot allow foot clearance similar marching pattern . The device ability provide abduction plantar/dorsi flexion positioning . This device ability alter stepping , would allow user take fast slow step longer short stride length , thus permit walk velocity 0.10 0.45 m/s . Stopping achieve hold stationary position activate sensor . The Ekso allow vary robot-assist level decrease increase bilaterally . The robot assistance operate full variable assist , dependent level function individual .</detailed_description>
