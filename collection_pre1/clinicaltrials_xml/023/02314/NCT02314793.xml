	<detailed_description>Part 1 single ascend dose investigator-blinded study healthy young male female subject . Six dose ASP2205 match placebo give separate cohort consist 8 subject , 6 subject receive ASP2205 2 subject receive match placebo . ASP2205 match placebo give single oral dose fast condition . The effect high-calorie high-fat meal ( breakfast ) safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics single oral dose ASP2205 evaluate separate cohort 8 subject open-label manner . Part 2 multiple ascend dose subject- investigator-blinded study comprise 3 cohort 12 healthy young ( aged 25 55 year ) female subject 1 cohort 12 healthy elderly ( age 65 year old ) female subject receive ASP2205 match placebo . Nine subject cohort treat ASP2205 3 subject treat match placebo ( ratio 3:1 ) .</detailed_description>
