	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine good method administer pain medication prior minimally invasive gynecological surgery postoperative pain and/or narcotic usage may minimize . Currently , standard care exist regard use local pain medication minimally invasive gynecological surgery practice vary widely among physician , even within institution . The two method preemptive pain medication study look transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block local injection pain medication area skin incision . TAP block procedure perform specially trained pain management anesthesiologist injection local pain medication abdominal wall , specifically space nerve responsible postoperative pain reside . This procedure block ability nerve sense pain find successful decrease postoperative pain number procedure . The local injection pain medication incision site also find beneficial decrease postoperative pain . However , know whether one method superior decrease postoperative pain combination best . Patients chose participate randomly ( chance ) assign one three group : 1 ) TAP block pain medication local injection normal saline ( water ) incision sit 2 ) TAP block normal saline local injection pain medication incision sit 3 ) TAP block pain medication local injection pain medication port site . These procedure perform patient asleep . Patients ask record level pain standardize pain scale one hour , six hour , twenty-four hour surgery . All patient provide standard postoperative pain medication need . The hypothesis patient receive TAP block local injection pain medication port sit less pain postoperatively require small amount narcotic receive either TAP block local injection pain medication alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Transversus Abdominis Plane Block Versus Local Injection Pain Medication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , single center , double-blinded , multi-arm parallel group study conduct university affiliate medical center . Study approval obtain Saint Barnabas Medical Center institutional review board , write informed consent obtain study participant . Patients randomly assign one three parallel group 1:1:1 ratio , receive either : treatment transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block placebo local injection , placebo TAP block treatment local injection , treatment TAP block treatment local injection . This study take place Saint Barnabas Medical Center Livingston , New Jersey May 2011 October 2013 . Patients recruit office ten different gynecological surgeon private practice . Two surgeon gynecological oncologist , remainder general obstetricians/gynecologists perform minimally invasive gynecological surgery . The TAP block administer one four anesthesiologist . Patients consent enrolled study blind obstetrical gynecological resident patient preoperative area . Each patient give standardize informed consent packet detail study . Once patient give inform consent enrol study , independent pharmacist notify enrollment . The pharmacist assign participant one three possible intervention base computer-generated randomization list create principal investigator prior commencement patient enrollment . The pharmacist assign patient appropriate intervention base upon number participant patient study . The pharmacist dispense study medication identical 30 mL syrinx label study drug place brown paper bag . The study medication administer via TAP block place two 30 mL syrinx place brown paper bag . The study medication use local injection place single 30 mL syringe place separate brown paper bag . These bag bring operate room administer . The bag contain two syrinx give anesthesiologist perform TAP block bag single syringe hand scrub tech later distribute surgeon . The patient , healthcare provider , data collector blind group allocation . Additionally , ropivacaine normal saline clear indistinguishable one another . The intervention administer operating room patient place general anesthesia , prior skin incision . The TAP block administer ultrasound guidance . Patients prepped draped surgery . Prior proceed skin incision surgeon administer 2 mL local injection subcutaneously intend port site location . If additional port site deem necessary procedure study drug administer similar fashion prior skin incision make . Postoperatively patient receive standardized analgesia regimen . Specifically , mild pain , oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg one tablet orally every four hour ; moderate pain , oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg two tablet orally every six hour , severe pain , hydromorphone 1 mg every 3 hour intravenously .</detailed_description>
