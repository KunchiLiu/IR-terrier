	<brief_summary>Introduction Necrotising soft tissue infection ( NSTI ) incorporate spectrum pathology , characterize infectious state , typically arise penetrate trauma surgical procedure expeditious spread necrosis throughout soft tissue body . It rare , life-threatening devastate infection define necrosis fascia , subcutaneous tissue skin . Aggressive surgical debridement remove necrotic tissue define extent disease still mainstay correct treatment NSTI . Both negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) application allograft skin debrided area , document option wound bed preparation standard university hospital Gent . NPWT technique wound bed preparation involve control application sub-atmospheric pressure local wound environment , use seal wound dress connect vacuum pump . Mechanisms action attribute NPWT include increase blood flow , promotion angiogenesis , reduction wind surface area , positive modulation inhibitory content wound fluid , induction cell proliferation , reduction edema , bacterial clearance . Allograft skin cadaveric skin possess many ideal property biologic dressing , play major role surgical management extensive wound autologous tissue may immediately available . It reduce evaporative water loss drainage protein-rich fluid , prevents wound desiccation , suppress microbial proliferation . Wound pain lessen allograft restores physiologic barrier wound surface . Enhancing revascularization , thereby create viable wound bed final reconstruction , perceive one important feature allografting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study objectives This study compare negative pressure wound therapy versus cadaveric skin treatment option wind bed preparation wound result necrotising soft tissue infection . Methodology One arm include NPWT system use conjunction gauze foam dressing . Dressing change normally carry twice week unless otherwise indicate wound condition , patient clinical presentation seal broken beyond repair . NPWT wind bed preparation end two experienced plastic surgeon consider wound bed suitable autografting . ( Endpoint ) The second arm include application cadaveric skin . The allograft normally change every seven ten day earlier depend adhesion allograft wound bed . In practice , ability allograft adhere wound bed diagnostic value , refer 'take-test ' . If allograft adhere , one must consider infection non-viable wound surface . If allograft adheres wound bed adequate granulation tissue suspect underneath , wound bed suitable autografting .
