	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety tolerability investigational anticancer drug DCR-MYC . DCR-MYC novel synthetic double-stranded RNA stable lipid particle suspension target oncogene MYC . MYC oncogene activation important growth many hematologic solid tumor malignancy . In study Sponsor propose study DCR-MYC ability inhibit MYC thereby inhibit cancer cell growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ib/2 , Multicenter , Dose Escalation Study DCR-MYC Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In second study human , DCR-MYC administer 2 hour intravenous ( IV ) infusion , weekly 2 week follow rest week ( 3 week = 1 cycle ) , patient hepatocellular carcinoma either sorafenib-refractory , sorafenib-intolerant despite dose reduction best supportive care , neither sorafenib suitable therapy available . During Phase 1b portion study , high safe dose DCR-MYC administer identify . In addition , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile , potential pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect , well preliminary antitumor activity DCR-MYC evaluate . During Phase 2 portion study , 30 patient treat MTD identify Phase 1b order evaluate safety tolerability , well assess antitumor activity , DCR-MYC .</detailed_description>
