	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate efficacy topical tranexamic acid reduce perioperative blood loss , reduction postoperative drain output allogenic transfusion requirement . The propose study prospective , randomize , double-blind ( subject , surgeon , investigator , research coordinator ) placebo-controlled study . Patients follow high energy trauma sustain thoracic lumbar spine fracture , dislocation ligamentous injury resultant instability require posterior spinal fusion enrol study . Furthermore , patient undergo elective complex deformity surgery also enrol . Both population patient randomize two group . Group I receive standard care operative fixation topical tranexamic acid intervention ( test ) ; Group II receive standard care operative fixation normal saline ( placebo ) intervention . This study 2-year follow-up consist three period : screening/enrollment phase 21 day day injury day randomization operative intervention , inpatient data collection period 4 day postoperative , follow-up period 2-years postoperative ( visit occur 2 week , 16 week , 1 year , 2 year ) time point .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Reducing perioperative blood loss critically important treatment multiply injure combat casualty , major blood loss complex spine trauma surgery significant concern . Similar previous study dental , cardiac , total knee arthroplasty procedure , use topical tranexamic acid complex combat relate spine trauma surgery cost-effective simple route administration reduce blood loss , significant systemic effect . Patients would expect benefit immediately decrease blood loss need blood transfusion postoperatively , thereby expose less risk transfusion reaction disease transmission . This may also potentially decrease rate surgical site infection patient find significantly increase risk surgical site infection blood transfusion due change immune system , also decrease amount blood collect surgical wound , serve excellent medium bacterial growth . The goal investigator study determine use topical tranexamic acid ( TXA ) set complex spine trauma surgery reduces blood loss , subsequently reduce rate allogenic blood transfusion surgical site infection .</detailed_description>

Preoperative hemoglobin value &lt; 7 g/dL , &lt; 10 g/dL patient comorbidities symptoms require preoperative allogeneic blood transfusion 9 . Refusal consent blood product 10 . Participation another clinical trial 11 . Previous thoracic lumbar spine surgery 12 . Moderate severe traumatic brain injury allow participation individual patient outcome survey 13 . Subarachnoid hemorrhage , anecdotal experience indicate cerebral edema cerebral infarction may cause TXA 14 . Concomitant use Factor IX Complex concentrate Antiinhibitor Coagulant concentrate , risk thrombosis may increase 15 . Preoperative use anticoagulant therapy ( heparin , lowmolecular weight heparin , warfarin ) within three day surgery , nonsteroid inflammatory medication ( aspirin , ibuprofen , naprosyn ) use within seven day surgery 16 . Fibrinolytic disorder require intraoperative antifibrinolytic treatment 17 . Disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) 18 . Coagulopathy ( identify preoperative platelet count &lt; 150,000/mm3 , international normalize ratio &gt; 1.4 , prolong partial thromboplastin time &gt; 1.4 time normal ) 19 . History arterial venous thromboembolic disease ( cerebrovascular accident , deepvein thrombosis , pulmonary embolus ) , patient may increase risk venous arterial thrombosis 20 .
