	<brief_summary>Ischemia reperfusion injury may attenuate HO-1 induction . Our previous data confirm strong HO-1 induction peripheral blood cell follow heme arginate infusion healthy humans5 . Furthermore , could demonstrate amelioration experimental ischemia reperfusion injury calf musculature heme arginate healthy subject measure functional MRI6 . Therefore , propose HO-1 induction human heart may suitable target mitigate cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury . The HO-1 induction assess clinical trial myocardial biopsy prior aortic cross clamp subject without precede heme arginate treatment two different dosage . The HO-1 expression also measure clinical trial peripheral blood mononuclear cell . As additional outcome , level myoglobin , creatine-kinase troponin T reactive oxygen specie measure plasma accord standard laboratory procedure .</brief_summary>
