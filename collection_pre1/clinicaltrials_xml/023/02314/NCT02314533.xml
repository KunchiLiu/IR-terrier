	<brief_title>Evaluate Efficacy Fenofibrate Microalbuminuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes become major public health problem China , large-scale epidemiological survey reveal prevalence 9.7 % approximately 5 year ago [ 1 ] . Diabetic nephropathy ( DN ) common microvascular complication major cause end-stage renal disease require dialysis and/or renal transplantation [ 2 ] . Thus , strategy aim treatment DN important target diabetes . Diabetic nephropathy associate mesangial cell expansion , thicken glomerular tubular basement membrane , glomerulosclerosis tubular necrosis . These structural change could lead occurrence albuminuria , elevation serum creatinine urea nitrogen level , reduction glomerular filtration rate [ 3 ] . Despite effective intervention angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor angiotensin-II-type 1 ( AT1 ) receptor blocker available treat diabetic nephropathy [ 4-5 ] , hitherto , promise intervention practice could satisfactorily improve clinical outcome diabetic nephropathy . Current treatment protocol management diabetic nephropathy target tight glucose blood pressure control hyperglycemia hypertension major risk factor disease progression nephropathy [ 6-7 ] . In addition , dyslipidemia suggest strongly associate induction progression diabetic nephropathy [ 8-9 ] While renal lipid accumulation- induced lipotoxicity could develop diabetic nephropathy [ 10 ] , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPARa ) agonist could place treatment diabetic nephropathy [ 11 ] . Experimental clinical study suggest fenofibrate , fibrate class hypolipidemic agent , act PPARa agonist , ameliorate diabetic renal damage prevent renal oxidative stress , inflammation fibrosis . Our previous study show fenofibrate contributes beneficial effect prevent endothelial dysfunction upregulating level BH4 decrease production ROS mechanism increase level intracellular GTPCH-I . Fenofibrate may help protect vascular damage potential promote re-coupling eNOS normalize endothelial disorder [ 12-13 ] . Moreover , fenofibrate significantly reduce pathological change glomeruli improve glomerular capillary size reduce mesangial expansion [ 14-16 ] . Few clinical study also confirm renoprotective potential fenofibrate diabetic nephropathy . The 'Fenofibrate Intervention Event Lowering Diabetes ( FIELD ) ' study suggest fenofibrate treatment promise effect prevent progression diabetes-associated microvascular complication , include diabetic nephropathy [ 17-18 ] . In FIELD study , among type 2 diabetic patient ( 9795 patient ) , 5 year , fell ACR great participant fenofibrate ( 23.7 % vs 11.5 % ) , albuminuria average progress 14 % le frequently reverse 18 % often among diabetic patient receive fenofibrate compare placebo.The investigator trial suggest fenofibrate could protect loss underlying renal function see patient T2DM [ 19 ] .And also ACCORD study [ 20 ] , low incidence micro- macro-albuminuria note fenofibrate compare placebo group [ 38.2 vs. 41.6 % ( P = 0.01 ) 10.5 vs. 12.3 % ( P = 0.04 ) , respectively ] . Unfortunately , fenofibrate therapy FIELD study , plasma creatinine note increase , quickly reverse placebo assignment . Though remain high fenofibrate treatment compare placebo , chronic rise slow less loss estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) . How short-term increase affect long-term renal function also assess retrospective subanalysis ACCORD study [ 21 ] . Among fenofibrate-treated patient , 321 experience increase SCr levels＞20 % ( case ) within first 3 month treatment . Patients SCr increase ＜2 % control ( n = 175 ) . In patient well 565 placebo-treated subject , SCr cystatin C level measure baseline 6-8 week treatment discontinuation . As expect , case significantly high SCr level low eGFR control placebo treat individual end study . However , SCr level eGFR case return placebo level 51 day treatment discontinuation . At time , fenofibrate-treated patient initial increase SCr level low SCr level high eGFR . In set careful renal function surveillance reduction fenofibrate dose indicate , increase renal disease cardiovascular outcome see individual demonstrate fenofibrate-associated creatinine increase [ 22 ] .Taken together , fenofibrate could delay albuminuria eGFR impairment T2DM patient . Of note , study report Hottelart et al . [ 23 ] , fenofibrate associate increase creatininemia renal patient reflect impairment renal function . Fenofibrate-induced increase creatinine production suggest associate enhanced metabolic production rate creatinine . The Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study ( DAIS ) patient T2DM treat micronized fenofibrate average 38 month suggest fenofibrate significantly reduce worsen albumin excretion , associate reduced progression normal albumin excretion microalbuminuria [ 24 ] . The investigator conclude improvement lipid profile fenofibrate patient T2DM associate reduced progression microalbuminuria . These study collectively suggest fenofibrate could afford renoprotection prevent induction progression nephropathy diabetic patient experience abnormal lipid profile diabetic dyslipidemia renal inflammation . The investigator design study investigate fenofibrate 's effect microalbuminuria reduction serum creatinine top statin therapy Chinese hypertriglyceridemic patient type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
