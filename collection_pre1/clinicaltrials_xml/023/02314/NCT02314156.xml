	<brief_summary>This randomized trial study transdermal oral telapristone acetate treat patient undergo surgery remove breast ( mastectomy ) . Telapristone acetate may help prevent breast cancer form premenopausal woman . Giving telapristone acetate transdermally may safer few side effect oral administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transdermal Oral Telapristone Acetate Treating Patients Undergoing Mastectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To demonstrate mean level telapristone ( telapristone acetate ) breast tissue follow gel application result level 50 % low follow oral administration . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess whether plasma concentration telapristone significantly low transdermal oral therapy . II . To compare within-breast variation breast tissue concentration transdermal oral group . III . To measure change cell proliferation ( marker proliferation Ki-67 [ Ki67 ] label index ) apoptosis ( terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate [ dUTP ] nick end label [ TUNEL ] ) breast cancer sample obtain diagnostic core needle biopsy ( cancer ) research core needle biopsy ( unaffected breast ) tissue sample obtain mastectomy . Measure protein expression relate target follow order priority : progesterone receptor isoforms ( progesterone receptor [ PR ] A PRB ) , estrogen receptor alpha ( ERÎ± ) TUNEL use immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) baseline treatment . IV . Explore change gene expression breast tissue relate telapristone therapy . V. Assess change serum progesterone associate telapristone therapy . VI . Assess safety tolerability oral transdermal administration . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I ( TRANSDERMAL TELAPRISTONE ACETATE ) : Patients receive telapristone acetate transdermally placebo orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 4 week . ARM II ( ORAL TELAPRISTONE ACETATE ) : Patients receive placebo transdermally telapristone acetate PO QD 4 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow day 60 .</detailed_description>
