	<brief_summary>The investigator research two reason . The first see retina ( back eye ) change blood sugar treat medication first time . This help u good understand progression condition know Diabetic Retinopathy . The second reason provide diabetic blood sample , possibly help identify biomarkers diabetic retinopathy . Biomarkers thing indicate presence specific condition , indicate high likelihood develop condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Progression Diabetic Retinopathy With Rapid Correction Hyperglycemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal research conduct study investigates ( 1 ) diabetic retinopathy progress poorly control Type 2 diabetic patient initiate intensive blood sugar control ( 2 ) determine biomarkers predict progression diabetic retinopathy . Typically , retina think undergo rapid progression diabetic retinopathy , although poorly characterize formal study . The first goal quantify take initial photo retina Pictor Plus hand-held fundus camera , well monthly photo ( patient schedule endocrinology appointment , throughout 90 day period ) . The second goal accomplish test patient 's blood . There initial blood withdraw , well blood withdraws monthly interval throughout 90 day period fundus photo . This study help u understand pathogenesis diabetic retinopathy , well potentially lead improve understanding progression diabetic retinopathy .</detailed_description>
