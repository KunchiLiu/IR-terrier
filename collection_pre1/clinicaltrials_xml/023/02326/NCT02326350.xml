	<brief_summary>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) cause lungs fail due collection fluid lung ( pulmonary oedema ) . ARDS common severely ill patient Intensive Care Units associate high mortality high morbidity survive . There large economic burden direct healthcare cost , also indirectly due impact carer patient inability return full time employment . There little evidence effective drug ( pharmacological ) treatment ARDS . Blood cell call platelet increasingly recognize play key role development ARDS . There increase information aspirin , drug widely use treat heart disease , might important treating ARDS . We plan test aspirin help treatment ARDS . To divide patient suffer ARDS two group , one get aspirin harmless dummy ( placebo ) tablet follow determine lung function improve . If effective may lead research determine aspirin effective patient ARDS . This project also provide new information mechanism development ARDS leading , potentially , new treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ASpirin Treatment ARDS ( STAR ) : Phase 2 Randomised Control Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The role aspirin novel therapy ARDS . Aspirin inhibit cyclo-oxygenase enzyme , therefore prevent formation lipid mediator include thromboxane A2 ( TxA2 ) pro-inflammatory prostaglandin arachidonic acid . TxA2 require platelet degranulation aggregation . Production pro-inflammatory prostaglandin arachidonic acid mediate cyclo-oxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) , enzyme induced inflammatory endothelial cell cytokine , growth factor bacterial product include lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . Prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) key downstream pro-inflammatory product COX-2 activation . It act auto paracrine fashion local inflammatory parenchymal cell increase intracellular cyclic adenosine mono-phosphate ( cAMP ) , drive nuclear translocation NFκB thus production many pro-inflammatory cytokine , include TNFα IL-8 . Aspirin also induce production lipoxin ( aspirin-triggered 15-epi-lipoxin A4 , also know ATL ) . Lipoxins group anti-inflammatory eicosanoids derive arachidonic acid act via lipoxin A4 receptor ( LXA4R ) leucocytes inhibit free-radical formation , reduce activation proinflammatory transcription factor AP-1 NFκB , implicate development ARDS . Hypothesis . Treatment aspirin safe improves important surrogate clinical outcome adult patient ARDS . Trial objective . To conduct randomised , double-blind , allocation conceal , placebo-controlled phase 2 trial aspirin treatment ARDS . To study biological effect aspirin pulmonary systemic inflammatory response , epithelial endothelial function injury lipid inflammatory mediator . Population . Patients prospectively screen daily . All patient ARDS enter screen log . If patient recruit reason record , ensure study report keep CONSORT guideline ( www.consort-statement.org ) . Routinely collected patient demographic also collect patient . This allow comparison identify study population representative overall cohort patient . We establish effective system place screen identify patient ARDS . Informed consent procedure . The study conduct accordance ethical principle origin Declaration Helsinki . The chief investigator ( CI ) responsible ensure informed consent trial participation give patient legal representative . An appropriately trained doctor nurse may take consent . Appropriate signature date must obtain informed consent documentation prior collection trial data administration trial drug . If consent give patient randomise trial . The incapacitating nature condition precludes obtain prospective inform consent participant . In situation inform consent seek Personal Legal Representative Professional Legal representative . Personal legal representative consent . Informed consent seek patient 's personal legal representative ( Per LR ) may relative , partner close friend . The Per LR inform trial responsible clinician member research team provide copy cover statement Per LR attach participant information sheet ( PIS ) ask give opinion whether patient would object take part medical research . If Per LR decide patient would objection participate trial ask sign two copy Per LR consent form countersign person take consent . The Per LR retain one copy sign consent form . The second copy photocopy photocopy place patient ' medical record whilst original retain trial site file . Professional legal representative consent . As patient unable give inform consent Per LR available , doctor connect conduct trial may act professional legal representative ( Prof LR ) . The doctor inform trial responsible clinician member research team give copy PIS . If doctor decides patient suitable entry trial ask sign two copy professional legal representative consent form . The doctor retain one copy sign consent form . The second copy photocopy photocopy place patient 's medical record ; original retain trial site file . Retrospective patient consent . Patients informed participation trial responsible clinician member research team regain capacity understand detail trial . The responsible clinician member research team discus study patient patient give copy PIS keep . The patient ask consent participate trial sign two copy consent continue form countersign person take consent . The patient retain one copy sign consent form . The second copy photocopy photocopy place patient 's medical record whilst original retain trial site file . Where consent continue obtain , consent legal representative remain valid . If patient refuse consent , permission use data collect point access medical record trial data request patient . Withdrawal consent . Patients may withdraw withdrawn ( Per LR Prof LR ) trial time without prejudice consent request use data collect point . If patient Per LR request termination trial drug treatment period , drug stop patient continue followed-up part trial . If patient Per LR withdraws consent trial treatment , trial drug stop permission seek access medical record data related trial . If patient Per LR wish withdraw trial completion trial treatment , permission access medical record trial data seek . Randomisation . Patients STAR study eligible co-enrolment non-CTIMP study , decide case case basis . Randomisation procedure . The clinical trial pharmacist provide randomisation schedule generate CTU . After informed consent , researcher contact clinical trial pharmacist allocate next sequential number per randomisation schedule . Randomisation stratify vasopressor use . The clinical trial pharmacist dispense trial drug . Study drug dispense per local pharmacy guideline . Aspirin placebo study drug identical appearance . The researcher register recruit patient CTU . Study procedures unblinding . The investigator treat physician may unblind participant 's treatment assignment case emergency , knowledge study treatment essential appropriate clinical management welfare subject . Should treat clinician require emergency unblinding , contact clinical trial pharmacist Royal Victoria Hospital work hour work hour call pharmacist Belfast Health Social Care Trust emergency unblinding . Following patient stable , reasonable effort make contact CI co-Investigators contactable via emergency contact telephone number The date reason unblinding must record CRF . Study drug Treatment regimen . Subjects randomise receive aspirin 75mg capsule placebo capsule enterally 14 day . Subjects randomise 1:1 ratio use block variable size . The first dose study drug ideally administer within 4 hour randomisation subsequent dose close 10 possible start follow calendar day . Study drug compliance . Any omission study drug record CRF monitor compliance . Study drug accountability . The clinical trial pharmacist responsible maintaining record study drug dispense patient ICU include date , quantity , lot number expiry date . Drug administration record patient 's prescription chart . Study drug return destruction . At end treatment period remain unused drug return hospital pharmacy . Destruction trial medication accordance pharmacy department 's standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) hospital waste management policy . A record destruction maintain . Standardised management . All patient receive standardised management regard nutrition , antibiotic policy , fluid management weaning . Patients manage use standardised mechanical ventilation protocol aim tidal volume 6 ml/kg ideal body weight . The influence treatment provide critically ill patient minimise study undertaken single centre standardise care deliver base evidence base local guideline . Data collection recording . All data individual patient collect CI delegate nominee record CRF . CRFs submit CTU per CRF Submission Schedule . Patient identification CRF unique Subject Number allocate time randomisation initial . Data collect time patient consider entry trial discharge hospital . Submitted data reviewed completeness enter onto secure , backed-up custom database . Due care take ensure data safety integrity , compliance Data Protection Act 1998 . Data censorship occur 90 day post randomisation . Training Issues . To ensure accurate , complete reliable data , CTU follow : - Be available consultation trial personnel mail , telephone and/or fax . - Review evaluate CRF data , detect error data collection request data verification . Data management . Following submission CRFs CTU , data process per CTU SOPs . Data query generate site staff require clarify data request miss information . The designated site staff require respond query within 2 week send back CTU review sign CI/delegated staff member . Any amend information enter study database . A copy sign data query form retain CRF investigator site . Data storage . All essential documentation trial record store CI conformance applicable regulatory requirement access store information restrict authorised personnel . Statistical consideration . Sample size . The primary outcome measure difference OI aspirin placebo treat group day 7 . Based data recently complete clinical trial ARDS , mean ( standard deviation ; SD ) OI day 7 patient ARDS 62 ( 51 ) cmH2O/kPa . A sample size 56 subject ( 28 group ) 80 % power two-tailed significance level 0.05 detect clinically significant difference 39 cmH2O/kPa OI group . In previous phase 2 study similar size , find intervention demonstrate change OI similar magnitude confirm treatment effect size achieve . Although anticipate withdrawal loss follow-up allow sample size calculation . In previous single centre study simvastatin ARDS withdrawal . In multi-centre UK study pulmonary artery catheter ICU patient ( PAC-Man ) , patient lose follow , 3 % withdrew consent recover competency . This keep local data . Therefore drop-out rate 5 % estimate study require total 60 patient ( 30 group ) . Statistical analysis . For continuously distribute outcome , difference group test use independent sample t-tests analysis covariance transformation variable normality appropriate , non-parametric equivalent . Chi-square test ( Fisher 's Exact test ) use categorical variable . A secondary analysis exclude patient identify aspirin resistance also undertaken . The study analyse intention treat randomise patient included analysis . A p value 0.05 consider significant . Correlations change biological marker measure physiological clinical outcome assessed appropriate graphical statistical method include Pearson 's ( Spearmans ) correlation coefficient . A single final analysis plan end trial .</detailed_description>
