	<brief_summary>Echocardiographic assessment right ventricular function important diagnostic tool , challenge due unique structure anatomy right ventricle . Lately new technique develop used evaluating leave right ventricle function . This technique , call two dimensional ( 2D ) speckle track , base detecting speckle myocardial tissue use acoustic marker . The movement speckle represent movement tissue , allow u evaluate function , contraction relaxation , calculate strain rate , speed speckle , strain , distance . In last year technique use evaluate systolic function right ventricle several pathological condition , pulmonary hypertension , pulmonary embolism amyloidosis . Nonetheless , far little data normal RV strain strain rate value . In study investigator aim validate two dimensional ( 2D ) speckle track measurement RV function compare strain measurement cardiac MRI . Each patient perform cardiac MRI indication perform echocardiography examination addition , strain analysis perform cardiac MRI compare two dimensional speckle track analysis perform echocardiography .</brief_summary>
