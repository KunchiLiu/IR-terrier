	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers want learn breast cancer Latin American woman . They also want learn woman respond differently standard treatment . Tissue blood sample woman breast cancer need study disease order find new way prevent , diagnose , treat . Objective : - To learn biology genetics breast cancer Latin American woman . Eligibility : - Latin American woman age 18 old ethnic background clinical stage II III breast cancer . They must still active able self-care . Design : - Participants agree extra tissue blood sample collect . They also let tissue leave surgery use research . No procedure outside standard care do . - Participants may medical history , physical exam , blood test . They may pregnancy test . They may ultrasound , mammogram , scan . They may intravenous needle place arm vein . - Participants may core biopsy . For , needle insert breast . A piece tissue extract . - Participants chemotherapy may blood take treatment/before surgery . Tissue may also collect . - Participants complete questionnaire . It ask social economic background . It ask family history cancer . It also ask access diagnosis treatment breast cancer . - Participants may follow 5 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study characterize distribution molecular profile Latin American woman AJCC 7 clinical stage II III breast cancer . The molecular profile correlate epidemiological , histological , clinical characteristic , include pathologic response standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Moreover , study intend define molecular signature predict response neoadjuvant therapy breast cancer . This prospective cohort study investigational drug administer participant . The study conduct participate institution Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Mexico , Uruguay .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PART A OF THE STUDY : INCLUSION CRITERIA : Women age great equal 18 year . AJCC 7 clinical stage II III breast cancer . Clarification : Participants clinical stage II breast cancer later classify histologicallyconfirmed stage I remain study ; participant later classify histologicallyconfirmed stage IV breast cancer take study . Biopsyaccessible breast tumor participant candidate primary surgery . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Prior history nonbreast malignancy ( exclude situ cancer treat local excision basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin ) within 5 year prior enrollment study . Bilateral invasive insitu breast cancer . Inflammatory breast cancer . Clinical radiological evidence distant metastasis compute tomography ( CT ) , chest Xray , abdominal/thoracic ultrasound , bone scan , and/or liver function test include total bilirubin , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , within range define eligibility criterion Part B study . Prior hormone therapy , chemotherapy , biologic , targeted therapy , radiation therapy malignancy . Prior bisphosphonate therapy allow . Pregnant lactating woman : Effects develop human fetus chemotherapeutic agent recommend therapeutic dose remain incompletely define . For reason agent may teratogenic , woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( double barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry duration study treatment phase . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform study physician immediately . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother chemotherapeutic agent , woman breastfeed exclude . If participant childbearing potential ( woman consider childbearing potential least 2 year postmenopausal and/or surgically sterile ) , must document negative serum negative urine pregnancy test within 14 day entry study ( i.e. , within 14 day sign informed consent document ) . Subjects psychiatric illness and/or specific situation would limit compliance study requirement compromise participant followup . Lack ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Note : Subjects enrol prior amendment consider eligible even HIV/Hep C pregnancy test preform due country standard . ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PART B OF THE STUDY : Participants , successfully enrol first part study , accord local institutional guideline , candidate neoadjuvant chemotherapy participate Part B study . Participants must also meet inclusion exclusion criterion describe . INCLUSION CRITERIA : Histologically confirm new primary adenocarcinoma breast AJCC 7 clinical stage II III . All histological type include Hormone status : Any tumor ER/PgR status , HER2/neu status measure local hospital pathology laboratory follow US LA CRN standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) . Normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1500/microL Platelets great equal 100,000/microL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit , unless participant Gilbert disease , bilirubin must less equal 2.0 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) /ALT serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) less equal 1.5 time institutional ULN ALP less equal 2.5 time institutional ULN Creatinine less equal 1.5 time institutional ULN Negative serum urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) , unless participant posthysterectomy menopausal . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Uncontrolled severe cardiac disease . Baseline leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) nuclear image echocardiography must within normal institutional limit . Use investigational agent within 30 day start standard chemotherapy treatment . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition chemotherapeutic agent accompany supportive medication . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness and/or specific situation would limit compliance study requirement compromise participant followup . INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES : Latin American woman breast cancer ethnic background include study participant . There expect racial/ethnic difference recruitment effort .</criteria>
