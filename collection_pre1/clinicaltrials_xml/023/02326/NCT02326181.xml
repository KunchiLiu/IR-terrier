	<brief_summary>The study investigate effect different training type , include combine inspiratory expiratory pressure threshold training , inspiratory pressure threshold training patient chronic obstructive airway disease investigate whether expiratory pressure threshold training associate inspiratory pressure threshold training would better inspiratory pressure threshold training alone , regard exercise capacity , respiratory muscle strength endurance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Inspiratory Expiratory Pressure Training Methods Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We study 60 patient diagnose chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.The monitoring do 8 week . Pressure-threshold respiratory trainer calibrate provide different load accord patient inspiration ( IMST ) expiration ( EMST ) . Those chronic obstructive pulmonary disease clinically stable patient stratify mild severe GOLD stage , blind randomly divide 3 different group : ) control group : without training ; b ) inspiratory expiratory pressure threshold train group : trained pressure threshold trainer twice time daily 15minutes ' duration ; c ) inspiratory pressure threshold training group : trained pressure threshold trainer twice time daily 15 minute ' duration , different b group , expiratory pressure threshold calibrate 0 .</detailed_description>
