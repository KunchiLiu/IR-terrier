	<brief_title>PROSTVAC ( PSA-TRICOM ) Preventing Disease Progression Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Undergoing Active Surveillance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect PROSTVAC ( rilimogene-galvacirepvec ) change ( pre post-intervention ) cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8+ positive cell stroma adjacent tumor within malignant portion prostate biopsy . II . To determine effect PROSTVAC change CD4+ positive cell stroma adjacent tumor within malignant portion prostate biopsy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect PROSTVAC program cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) positive cell stroma adjacent tumor within malignant portion prostate biopsy . II . To assess correlation change CD8+ change PSA . III . To assess effect PROSTVAC CD8+ , CD4+ , PD-L1 positive cell benign portion prostate biopsy . IV . To assess effect PROSTVAC change PSA . V. To assess effect PROSTVAC tumor grade ( Gleason score ) . VI . To assess effect PROSTVAC tumor extent ( percent positive random biopsy core ) . VII . To compare proportion men two study arm cancer post-intervention biopsy . VIII . To assess effect PROSTVAC size dominant lesion magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ( large histopathologically confirm lesion ) subgroup patient MRIs pre postintervention . IX . To assess effect PROSTVAC circulate 15-Mer PSA-specific , MUC-1 Brachyury-specific T cell . X . To assess effect PROSTVAC soluble antibody tumor-associated antigen . XI . To assess immunologic effect PROSTVAC prostate tissue use multiplex immunofluorescence . XII . To assess safety feasibility PROSTVAC active surveillance population . XIII . To assess effect PROSTVAC low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) active surveillance population . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive rilimogene-galvacirepvec subcutaneously ( SC ) baseline day 14 , 28 , 56 , 84 , 112 , 140 . ARM II : Patients receive placebo SC baseline day 14 , 28 , 56 , 84 , 112 , 140 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day 6 month .</detailed_description>
