	<brief_summary>Literature provide overwhelming evidence support use chlorhexidine gluconate ( CHG ) rapid onset , broad spectrum , topical antiseptic reduce healthcare-associated infection ( HAIs ) . CHG believe superior form antiseptic , apply skin surface , leave last residue skin . CHG show well tolerated patient 2 month age old . However limited evidence support use topically apply CHG infant less 2 month age potential safety concern population . The purpose study describe safety bi-weekly CHG bath sample Newborn Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit ( CICU ) patient measure incidence skin problem CHG blood level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study : Safety Chlorhexidine ( CHG ) Baths Patients Less Than 2 Months Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence overwhelmingly support use Chlorhexidine Gluconate ( CHG ) rapid onset , broad spectrum , topical antiseptic reduce Healthcare-associated Infections ( HAIs ) . CHG provide prolonged protection gram-positive gram-negative organism . Reports indicate CHG well tolerate patient great two month age . However , due safety concern , limit evidence support use topically apply CHG infant less 2 month age . The purpose Phase I Clinical ( pilot ) study describe safety bi-weekly CHG bath sample 50 Newborn Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit ( CICU ) patient , ( 36 week PMA old , less 2 month age 48 week PMA CVC ) , measure incidence skin problem CHG blood level . CHG bath perform every Monday Thursday day shift , 12 week post enrollment CVC remove patient discharge . Chlorhexidine Gluconate bath cloth market peri-operative skin preparation . However , daily CHG bath common practice ICUs around nation proven method prevent HAIs patient &gt; 2 month age old . Furthermore , CHG use skin antisepsis become widely accepted practice , part Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) CVC maintenance bundle use patient great 2 month age , recommendation use caution infant &lt; 2 month age . Hypothesis 1 : CHG safe use sample infant 36 week PMA old , less 2 month age ( 48 week PMA ) CVC evidence adverse event rate le 10 % . Hypothesis 2 : Twice weekly CHG bath lead rise ( cumulative ) CHG blood level , LFTs ( AST/ALT ) Serum Creatinine time sample infant 36 week PMA old , less 2 month age ( 48 week PMA ) CVC..</detailed_description>
