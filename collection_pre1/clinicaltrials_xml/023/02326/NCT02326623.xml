	<detailed_description>Setting Study Period : The study conduct ED Stollery Children 's Hospital . Patient recruitment project begin October 2014 continue March 2015 . Study Design Population : The study RCT ; primary outcome child 's self-reported pain observe behavioural distress . The population child , age 6 11 year , attend pediatric ED require IV placement . Recruitment : Research assistant ( RAs ) identify patient attend ED age 6 11 year . A RA on-site approximately 14:00 22:00 daily identify child require IV placement ; time correspond peak visit require IV placement base data collect ED Stollery Children 's Hospital team member ' previous study . For require IV placement , RA ass child eligibility base inclusion / exclusion criterion outline . If child eligible , RA explain study invite parent child participate . After obtain write , informed consent parent assent child , RA open prepare randomization envelope assign child one two intervention arm . The RA ask one parent caregiver child participate complete relevant questionnaire . Baseline Assessment : After inform consent/assent obtain , RA gather information parent baseline demographic variable ( e.g. , gender , age ) , present sign symptom ( e.g. , chief complaint ) , previous history ED visit IV placement . Randomization , Allocation , Blinding Study Treatment : Randomization method : A statistician prepare randomization sequence use appropriate software prepare envelop . Allocation conceal RAs , ED staff , child parent consent/assent obtain . The statistician maintain randomization code break data analysis complete . Allocation : After receive informed consent/assent , RA open next envelope series consecutively label , seal , opaque envelope . These keep secure location ED research office . Blinding : Due nature intervention , possible blind child , parent , research ED staff . The child parent inform study evaluate different form distraction know study hypothesis iPads group receive . The data analyst blind treatment assignment use randomization code disclose analysis complete . Study Intervention Comparison : The intervention use iPad include selection child-appropriate game . We select popular , age-appropriate item include iPad , choose base current online consumer rating . Children parent able select choice distraction change selection desire course procedure . These choice record study purpose . The control group receive standard care , generally include use topical anesthetic cream . This comparison base pragmatic preference physicians Stollery Children 's Hospital well precedent literature . Overall , felt new intervention ( e.g. , iPad ) compare currently practice ( i.e. , standard care ) , single distraction therapy consistently routinely employed EDs time . Study Outcomes : The primary outcome patient pain distress . Self-reported pain measure use Faces Pain Scale-Revised ( FPS-R ) . This measurement make immediately follow initial attempt IV placement . The FPS-R currently recommend pain scale participant group strong evidence validity reliability age range . Distress measure use Observed Scale Behavioral Distress-Revised ( OSBD-R ) ; tool design ass child 's behavioural response painful medical procedure . The scale score reliable valid target population . Two research student train use tool independently observe videotape child record frequency operationally-defined distress-related behaviour continuous 15-second interval , , procedure . This protocol use OSBD-R standard ; use trial evaluate distraction , include trial one PIs ( LH ) evaluate music . The secondary outcome ( ) observe pain measure research student use standard 100 mm visual analogue scale ; ( b ) parent provider satisfaction ( measure use Likert scale ) ; ( c ) ease perform procedure assess provider ; time complete procedure ; ( ) success procedure ; ( e ) parent state anxiety measure validated instrument , State Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI-S , Form Y ) .</detailed_description>
