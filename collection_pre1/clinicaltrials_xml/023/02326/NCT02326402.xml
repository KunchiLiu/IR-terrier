	<brief_title>TandemHeart Experiences MEthods ( THEME Registry )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TandemHeart percutaneous extracorporeal ventricular assist system use support circulation . The percutaneous cannula facilitate access venous arterial circulatory vessel . When connected TandemHeart centrifugal pump , mechanical support provide sufficient cardiac power perfuse organs body . It anticipate THEME Registry analysis provide insight disease define characteristic result clinical decision use TandemHeart mechanical support enhance knowledge best practice regard clinical management , wean removal . The progression illness prior , follow TandemHeart support collect . The THEME Registry collect descriptive data regard patient selection criterion clinical management TandemHeart patient include strategy use wean remove TandemHeart . Specifically objectives THEME registry : - Summarize characteristic patient receive TandemHeart temporary percutaneous mechanical support without oxygenator , include demographic , pre-implant medical history , detail present illness , TandemHeart exit strategy . - Evaluate timing initiation TandemHeart mechanical support relation progression present illness association clinical outcome . - Collect descriptive data relate clinical management patient TandemHeart mechanical support , include procedural detail , duration support , anticoagulation , hemodynamics biochemical parameter define trend clinical care association decision-making clinical outcome . - Collect hospital discharge information include Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) Hospital length stay ( LOS ) . - Collect survival exit strategy status 30 180 day post-initial TandemHeart insertion . - Collect serious adverse event time TandemHeart insertion removal TandemHeart System ( TandemHeart Blood Pump ) . - Provide data regard TandemHeart case mix , patient characteristic , outcome .</detailed_description>
