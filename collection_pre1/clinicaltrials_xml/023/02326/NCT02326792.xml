	<brief_summary>The fatigue trunk extensor muscle often report people chronic low back pain ( LBP ) . Evidences show strengthen muscular training lumbar spinal muscle efficient decrease pain disability symptom patient chronic LBP . Also , study report improve strength endurance back muscle type training muscular . However , exercise prescription trunk extensor muscle train still clear literature . In fact , study show difference one three set specific lumbar exercise regard good prescription train healthy subject ( e.g ; preventive action ) well LBP subject ( e.g ; intervention action ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare endurance trunk extensor train use one three set exercise repetition gain strength endurance muscular healthy subject . Forty-two healthy voluntary ( 18 35 year ) sex participate study . All participant sign inform consent form approve North Parana University Ethics Committee Research Human Subjects . The sample randomize three group allocation print card sequentially number opaque envelope : ( G1 , n=14 ) participant perform three set 15-20 repetition trunk extensor exercise roman chair machine hips 45 degree relative horizontal ; perform trunk flexion-extension cycle total 4 second ( 2 concentric 2 eccentric contraction ) ; ( G2 ) participant perform one set 15-20 repetition trunk extensor exercise roman chair machine hips 45 degree relative horizontal ; perform also trunk flexion-extension cycle total 4 second ( 2 concentric 2 eccentric ) ; ( G3 ) participant control group , participate exercise program time study . A total 10 week train perform study , 2 x week progression load volume ( increase load total repetition 20 reach ) . Before lumbar training , participant assess endurance muscular ( Isometric Sorensen test use time-limit , Dynamic endurance use number repetition , Borg fatigue perception scale EMG surface trunk extensor muscle computation median frequency fatigue estimate ) ; strength muscular ( back isometric maximal voluntary contraction use dynamometer roman chair ) . An evaluator train perform test assessment , baseline time week training . The evaluator blind regard group assessment . Also , exercise professional sport responsible exercise prescription prescript train Fitness center UNOPAR University ; This professional also blind group . An ANOVA two-way compare effect three group ( G1 , G2 , G3 ) two time session-1 : baseline session-2 : 10 week ) ; effect interaction ( Groups X Times ) also test . When necessary Tukey post hoc analysis perform localize difference three group . The effect size group calculate determine rate change train intervention .</detailed_description>
