	<brief_summary>Traditionally , memory impairment elderly population treat use cholinesterase inhibitor , although impairment remain treatment . Dopamine ( DA ) also involve cognition especially interest healthy age role process speed cognitive control . To extent dopamine treatment improve memory attention older impaired individual unknown . However , effect conceivable close relationship memory attention age since improve processing speed cognitive control may lead improved memory . The investigator aim examine , impaired old population , whether treatment use methylphenidate , DA re-uptake inhibitor enhances DA , improve attention memory . The study conduct accord cross-sectional , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 2-way cross-over design . 20 male female patient Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) , amnestic type , age 60 year age ; 20 male female patient MCI , non-amnestic type , recruit Orbis Medical Centre .
