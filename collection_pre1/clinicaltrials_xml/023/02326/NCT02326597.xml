	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) major public health problem United States estimate 100,000 individual live disease . It associate significant morbidity cause pain crisis , acute chest syndrome , stroke , pulmonary hypertension , leg ulcer irreversible organ damage . Quality life impair child adults disease 3-6 productivity impair , 40-60 % unemployment rate adult patient . The disease result premature mortality , median age death 38 year . In 2010 , approximately 100,000 hospital discharge United States SCD principal diagnosis . Mean hospital charge per admission $ 15,000 , total annual charge US exceed $ 1.5 billion . Approximately 70 % patient government sponsor medical insurance , predominantly Medicaid Medicare . Sickle cell disease thus archetype chronic multisystem disease predominantly affect minority , disadvantage population . Hydroxyurea ( HU ) demonstrate placebo control multi-center clinical trial efficacious reduce complication vasocclusive pain crisis acute chest syndrome child adult SCD improve survival adult . It disease-modifying therapy drug approve FDA use patient SCD . Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation demonstrate curative patient SCD . Only minority patient meet eligibility criterion transplantation , however , proceed treatment even match sibling donor available . The low utilization curative strategy SCD appear partly attributable lack information technology available facilitate transplantation . There minimal data patient-related barrier attitude towards , use curative therapy SCD . A systematic review research barrier care patient SCD identify study specifically address patient-related barrier use Hydroxyurea . The attitudes patient SCD toward use hydroxyurea ( HU ) therapy may contribute underutilization HU United States , yet understand attitude limited . Of patient never take HU , half report receive information HU , 85 % report believe would receive improvement take HU . In make choice regard transfusion , transplantation HU , family influence perceived efficacy safety . Thus significant gap remain understanding patient perspective , provision accurate information risk benefit therapy incorporate patient ' value preference offer treatment option . Thus , need research help understand patient value preference determines help patient make informed treatment decision congruence value preference . Hypothesis The investigator overarch hypothesis web base decision aid individualize patient characteristic improve knowledge help patient SCD achieve accurate perception risk benefit treatment option associate low decisional conflict standard care . To test hypothesis investigator propose follow specific aim : Aim 1 : Develop health literacy sensitive , web base , decision aid help patient sickle cell disease make informed choice treatment option hydroxyurea , chronic blood transfusion , bone marrow transplantation standard comprehensive care . Aim 2 : To estimate randomized clinical trial effectiveness decision aid tailor individual patient characteristic patient knowledge , patient involvement decision-making decision-making quality , compare usual care . Research Questions : 1 . What need patient sickle cell disease parents/caregivers consider treatment option sickle cell disease ? 2 . Does use decision aid result improvement patient knowledge , patient involvement decision , congruence decision value preference ? Methods Study Design Qualitative Interviews Decisional Needs Assessment : Consent in-person via telephone 30-45 minute interview use semi-structured open-ended question guide develop base Ottawa Decision Support Framework workbook , Decisional Needs Assessment Populations . Interviews audio record , transcribe verbatim analyzed merging theme . Demographics obtain include limited age , gender , education level , role sickle cell disease . Data result inform development web-based decision aid tool . Study Design Beta Testing : Consent in-person via telephone 30-45 minute interview use semi-structured open-ended question guide develop base cognitive interview technique web-based decision aid tool view via internet use computer tablet . Demographics obtain include limited age , gender , education level , role sickle cell disease . Data result inform edit revision web-based decision aid tool . Study Design Testing Decision Aid : Cohort A : randomize control trial use mixed method use web base decision aid give patient sickle cell disease parent/legal guardian child sickle cell disease accurate information risk benefit therapy enable make decision base individual value preference . Participants complete survey , soon within 4 month follow discussion health care provider determine impact decision aid knowledge , involvement decision decisional conflict , quality uptake adherence therapy . Qualitative semi-structured interview collect gather additional information relate decision making . The control group participate cross-over design , receive decision aid tool completion initial phase study . An additional qualitative interview collect regard decision making . Cohort B : mixed method descriptive study design determine impact decision aid quality comprehension information , impact daily life relate management sickle cell disease patient &lt; 18 year age . Cohort C - To good understand effect decision aid decision make patient involvement report physician consent patient ( child adult ) treatment ask participate study . Health care provider randomize .</detailed_description>
