	<brief_summary>Background : - The new drug BMN 673 ( talazoparib ) show fight tumor cell animal people . It PARP inhibitor . It work tumor cell DNA damage repair process . Researchers want see BMN 673 shrink cancer woman ovarian cancer whose cancer initially get shrunk grow back first PARP inhibitor . Objective : - To study BMN 673 ( talazoparib ) people ovarian cancer bear BRCA mutation whose cancer get shrunk become bad take similar drug . Eligibility : - Women least 18 year old : - recurrent and/or metastatic gBRCAm-associated ovarian cancer AND - whose disease grow already treat PARP inhibitor AND - treatment ( ) first PARP inhibitor screen visit . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , heart blood test . - Participants take study drug mouth daily . They take drug 28-day cycle . - They keep diary dos side effect . - Participants 4 study visit cycle 1 , 1 visit every cycle . Visits may include : - Blood test - Physical exam - Computed tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Participants lie machine take picture body . - Ultrasound - Participants biopsy start study drug . A small piece tumor tissue remove needle , guided scan . They may two biopsy later . - Participants follow 30 day take last dose study drug . A physical exam , blood test , CT scan do . - Participants follow-up call ask side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Patients germline BRCA1/2 mutation ( gBRCAm ) demonstrate repeat therapeutic susceptibility DNA damaging agent , especially platinum , even previously progress similar ( platinum-based ) regimen . - PARP inhibitor ( PARPi ) clinical activity gBRCAm-associated malignancy , although patient eventually develop progressive disease . - BMN 673 ( talazoparib ) novel PARPi , excellent oral bioavailability great anti-tumor activity vitro vivo low concentration first generation PARPi . - It unknown whether secondary BRCA mutation potential mechanism clinical resistance portend cross-resistance highly potent PARPi . Objectives : -To determine objective response rate ( CR+PR ) single agent BMN 673 ( talazoparib ) ovarian cancer patient gBRCAm progress prior PARPi therapy . Eligibility : - Women recurrent and/or metastatic gBRCAm-associated ovarian cancer , progression PARPi monotherapy within immediate prior 2 month time screen visit . - Patients respond prior PARPi therapy ( CR , PR SD &gt; 4months ) . - Patients receive another therapy stop first PARPi therapy\ initiate therapy trial , must prior PARPi least 4 week . - ECOG performance status 0-2 adequate organ marrow function . Design : - This open label , single arm phase II trial examine activity BMN 673 ( talazoparib ) . - Patients receive BMN 673 ( talazoparib ) RP2D 1mg p.o . daily 28 day cycle . - Research sample include whole blood , plasma , CTCs , tumor biopsy obtain PD endpoint baseline , cycle 1 day 29 ( prior cycle 2 day 1 ) , and/or progression patient . - Patients evaluate every two cycle response use RECISTv1.1 criterion every cycle safety use CTCAEv4.0 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Recurrent , and/or metastatic germline BRCA 1/2 mutationassociated ovarian cancer , progression PARP inhibitor monotherapy attain response PARPi ( CR , PR , SD great equal 4mo ) Progression occur within immediate prior 2 month time screen visit , intervene anticancer therapy . Patients must least 4 week last dose prior PARP inhibitor . All patient must least one lesion deem safe biopsy willing undergo mandatory baseline biopsy . It prefer lesion lesion progress arose prior PARP therapy . Histopathologic diagnosis ovarian cancer ( include primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer ) must confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI . Age great equal to18 year . ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 % . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great equal to100,000/mcL total bilirubin less equal 1.5X upper limit normal , unless know Gilbert syndrome AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 3 x institutional upper limit normal creatinine &lt; 1.5 X upper limit normal OR measure creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient serum creatinine level &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal . hemoglobin great equal 10 mg/dL ( absence transfusion within 24 hour prior dose ) . All patient must measurable disease RECIST . Use raloxifene bone health allow . Patients must least 1 week last dose complementary alternative medication . Patients major surgery must fully recover great equal 4 week postoperative prior enrol study . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , least three month follow last dose experimental therapy must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior start study . Patient must able swallow pill . Integral biomarkers : patient eligible study due history positive BRCA1/2 mutation must provide documented evidence deleterious germline mutation status , obtain CLIAcertified laboratory , include limited Myriad Genetics prior study enrollment . Variants uncertain significance ( VUS ) BRCA1/2 BRCA1/2 somatic mutation consider deleterious germline BRCA1/2 mutation . Due long acceptance BRCA 1 BRCA 2 mutation test Myriad , Myriad result acceptable . If test BRCA 1 BRCA 2 mutation do organization , genetic consultation report qualify medical professional confirm laboratory result show recognized germ line deleterious BRCA 1 BRCA 2 mutation deleterious BRCA 1 rearrangement require . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients prior BMN 673 ( talazoparib ) therapy . Patients know brain metastasis diagnose within 1 year exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Exception : patient brain metastasis diagnose great 1 year prior study entry may consider receive sterilize therapy CNS ( resection radiation ) CNS progressionfree 1year period . Lack recovery prior cancer therapyrelated adverse event Grade le equal 1 ( NCI CTCAE v4.03 ; except alopecia ) . Stable persistent grade 2 peripheral neuropathy may allow determined casebycase basis discretion PI . Patients platinumrelated grade 2 great hypomagnesemia ( replacement ) eligible . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , clinically significant GI bleeding hemoptysis within 28 day prior start study , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients active infection eligible , may become eligible infection resolve least 7 day completion antibiotic . Another previous current invasive malignancy within last 2 year , exception curatively treated stage Ia cervical carcinoma , resect stage Ia endometrial cancer , noninvasive nonmelanoma skin cancer . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction BMN 673 ( talazoparib ) . HIV positive patient cART CD4 count &gt; 500 eligible . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition BMN 673 ( talazoparib ) Patients receive investigational commercial agent intent treat malignancy . Patients gastrointestinal condition might predispose drug intolerability poor drug absorption . Use nasogastric Gtube administration .</criteria>
