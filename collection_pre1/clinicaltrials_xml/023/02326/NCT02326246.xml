	<brief_title>MRI Active Surveillance Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At urological department K , Aarhus University Hospital ( AUH ) , approx . 500 TRUS biopsy perform year 125 intermediate/high risk patient undergo radical prostatectomy ( RP ) . At time approx . 50 men low-risk PC active surveillance ( AS ) . The MRIs perform 3 Tesla MRI system phased-array coil include standard T1 T2-weighted sequence , diffusion-weighted sequence different b-values dynamic contrast sequence prostate gland . In patient previous mMRI show tumor , MRGBs perform commercially available DynaCAD-equipment design in-bore MR-guided prostate biopsy . The Study Design : prospective study 60* patient enrol AS program . From late 2014 approximately one year forward , patient put active surveillance diagnosis low risk PC , decision offer additional mMRI scan . If mMRI give rise suspicion significant cancer , MRGB take . Results biopsy assess , case gleason score up-grated , risk classification up-grated decision keep patient AS change , active treatment recommend . If scan find reason change strategy , patient usual follow-ups clinic , AS program usually consist control PSA value every 3 month , new TRUS guide biopsy 12 month PSA rise . Parallel usual control program perform new mMRI year ass progression disease , MRGB case . The study require access patient journal . We look patient demographic , specification PC find , histology blood sample . In study consult statistician work progress , ensure quality data work conclusion . Recruitment participant obtain informed consent At department 's weekly multi-disciplinary conference ( MDT ) , tissue sample , take ultrasound , present . On conference future treatment strategy patient plan . At conference possible identify possible candidate project . Afterwards , patient receives answer patient clinic , hospital doctor , offer interview study responsible Ph.D. student . The patient offer bring companion conversation , occur day later , depend patient 's preference opportunity escort . At conversation , oral write information give suitable consultation room outpatient clinic , evaluate patient suitable inclusion . The patient offer 24 hour think . The write consent obtain patient indicates need information reflection . Inclusion expect commence late year2014 , permission grant Ethics Committee . Expectedly inclusion patient complete within 12 month thus expect end late year 2015 . Side effect , risk drawbacks The precaution MRI safety take clinical patient use exist metal table , therefore known risk associate actual scan . While complete scan intravenous gadolinium-containing contrast use . This excreted kidney safe patient normal renal function ( see exclusion criterion ) . The common side effect propose contrast agent Dotarem® include : feeling heat , cold / pain injection site transient headache tingle sensation skin ( 1 10 individual ) . The patient may develop allergic reaction contrast , serious case risk heart failure , slow heartbeat , irregular heartbeat , respiratory , mucosal swell throat pleuritis lung , constriction airway , breathlessness sneezing . This rare ( less 1 10 000 individual ) . An allergic reaction immediately treat accord current guideline department . The patient question know allergy MRI contrast agent inclusion , immediately injection . In case find basis tissue sample MRI , risk sepsis bleed rectum . This risk assess far low usual use TRUS sample , usually 2-4 tissue sample compare 12 usual method . Patients receive preventive antibiotic usually give TRUS ( ciprofloxacin ) . In addition , selection associate discomfort / pain . This expect less usual procedure , usually few biopsy take . Patients prostate cancer currently routinely examine MR image surgery . Patients agree participate trial thus scan would otherwise receive . Participation study , therefore , mean patient must visit hospital second time . If MRI guide tissue sample must take also mean one two extra trip hospital ( depend histology ) . Practical economical aspects The study plan perform Department Urology K department MRI , Aarhus University Hospital - Skejby , commence September 1th 2014 continue three year forward . The project partly finance Danish cancer research foundation . Patients receive remuneration . * ( The . patient estimated power analysis base number find two relevant study AS mMRI PC . Having α-value = 0.05 β-value 0.8 give minimum 47 patient group . Expecting variation adjust include 60 patient group . )</detailed_description>
