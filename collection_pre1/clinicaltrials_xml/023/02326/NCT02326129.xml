	<brief_summary>The investigator want determine 11β-HSD1 activity positively associate , 5α-reductase activity negatively associate , ( ) degree insulin resistance define homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance index ( HOMA-IR ) ( b ) worsen glycemic control define high HbA1c impair fast glucose group obese child young adult without type 2 diabetes compare lean child young adult without diabetes . The investigator also want identify key metabolic signature associate diabetes use metabolomic profiling .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overarch hypothesis increase whole body 11β-HSD1 activity precede presage development type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) high-risk obese adolescent , serve critical determinant insulin resistance glucose intolerance . The increase 11β-HSD1 activity , combination decrease 5α-reductase activity , increase tissue cortisol production , promote development insulin resistance metabolic syndrome predispose T2D . The investigator predict increase 11β-HSD1 activity detect obese child prior development insulin resistance glucose intolerance progressive increase 11β-HSD1 correlate progressive decrease insulin sensitivity glucose tolerance . Given preliminary finding , investigator also predict increase 11β-HSD1 great occur earlier development male female . This could establish 11β-HSD1 activity novel , non-invasive biomarker progression , development , glucose intolerance T2D . The identification 11β-HSD1 biomarker predict T2D would critical clinical import , allow u identify obese child adult high risk metabolic decompensation . Studies 11β-HSD1 obese subject vary degree IR glucose intolerance also narrow critical gap understand pathogenesis T2D . The investigator would like also validate urine metabolomic profiling use identify key metabolomic signature associate insulin resistance . To end investigator would like examine detail metabolomic profile 24 hour spot urine sample . The study population include 20 obese adolescent T2D , 20 obese adolescent without T2D 25 age , gender , race pubertal status-matched normal weight control . The subject recruit Healthy Lifestyle Program Duke , Diabetes Clinics Lenox Baker Children 's Hospital Roxboro Clinics . Study activity include physical exam medical history , vitals , laboratory test ( obese adolescent ) , urine test sugar ( normal weight adolescent ) , 24 hour urine collection , spot urine collection , body fat content measurement , food activity questionnaire .</detailed_description>
