	<brief_summary>This study test capability non-invasive instrument ( PhysioFlow impedance cardiography instrument ) measure cardiac output patient congenital heart disease ( CHD ) . This instrument work place electrode skin patient measure electrical impedance chest , proportional blood volume blood flow give time . The instrument validate patient structurally normal heart , two study use patient CHD , deem inaccurate clinical use . The manufacturer device would require access data patient order improve accuracy , feasible thus far . This study would begin compare cardiac output base PhysioFlow monitor standard technique , possible change instrument enhance accuracy , would test instrument way .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Noninvasive Measurement CO Using Impedance Cardiography Patients With CHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The measurement cardiac output ( CO ) important wide variety patient multiple condition . At present , gold standard technique measurement CO include velocity encode phase contrast MRI . Both technique valid patient structural CHD . Disadvantages technique include requirement significant time expertise , high cost anesthesia requirement . Accurate , non-invasive tool measure CO could extremely valuable patient CHD require one-time continuous monitoring CO , surgery , intensive care setting , diagnostic testing , different physiologic state sleep exercise . This study would begin compare cardiac output base PhysioFlow monitor cardiac outout MRI . Impedance cardiography perform place electrode thorax neck measure electrical impedance time . Cardiac output derive measurement . The technique study , validate , use extensively adult also show valid child structurally normal heart . In contrast , recent study child CHD show relatively poor agreement impedance cardiography thermodilution technique velocity encode phase contrast MRI . The reason poor agreement CHD patient yet understood . There proprietary algorithm impedance device use raw data calculate report cardiac output . If physiologic and/or anatomic difference patient CHD require change algorithm within system account difference , need do system . In order , owner give device ( PhysioFlow , NeuMeDx Inc. case ) need access raw data order alter algorithm . This study involve concerted effort investigator RCHSD , UCSD , NeuMeDx</detailed_description>
