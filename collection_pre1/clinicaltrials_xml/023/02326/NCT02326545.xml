	<brief_summary>Anxiety prevalent form child 's mental health problem demand far exceeds treatment availability . Even child access care , evidence-based treatment cognitive-behavioural therapy several limitation : largely didactic , leave child unmotivated disengage ; child get little practice use skill taught , create large gap knowledge everyday behaviour therapy costly , often prohibitive child need . Therapeutic video game address gap : engage context child practice skill ( rather memorize lesson ) , cost substantially less conventional approach . The propose research test effectiveness MindLight , innovative video game target childhood anxiety problem . MindLight incorporate several evidence-based strategy include relaxation exposure technique , attention bias modification method , neurofeedback mechanic together produce immersive game world child learn manage overcome anxiety symptom . Two randomize control study 8-16 year old child propose test effectiveness MindLight reduce anxiety : first prevention study aim child risk develop serious anxiety problem second clinical trial aim decrease symptom anxiety-disordered child . Children randomly assign intervention group play MindLight 5 hour 2-3 week ; control participants prevention sample play commercial video game similar theme amount time whereas control participants clinical sample use online cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) program . Both study assess child 's anxiety level intervention , , 3-month follow-up . Moderators ( e.g. , comorbidities ) mediator ( e.g. , attention bias ) assess identify potential mechanism change associate successful intervention effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over next two year , investigator collect data two sample , henceforth identify Clinical Sample Prevention Sample . The laboratory protocol ( pre , post , follow-up ) ; however screen recruitment . In section , procedures method lab visit common described . Next video game intervention procedure describe . Participant recruitment detail subsequent section . Each participant visit Adolescent Dynamics Lab three time ( pre , post , follow-up ) minor difference note . Parents accompany child lab , follow completion consent form ( pre ) , complete set questionnaire via computer : Child report : - Demographics - Spence Child Anxiety Scale ( SCAS ) - Strengths Difficulties Questionnaire ( SDQ ) - emotional symptom - Top Problems questionnaire ( TP ) - Coping Questionnaire - Self-Efficacy Questionnaire ( SEQ-C ) Parent report : - Demographics ( include intervention child 's mental health try ) - SCAS ( report child ) - Strengths Difficulties Questionnaire - emotional symptom ( report child ) - Depression , Anxiety Stress Scale-21 ( DASS21 , report self ) Questionnaires Post Pre Follow-up except addition Video game evaluation ( child report ) . Once questionnaire complete , child participant sensor psychophysiological record attached female experimenter . First , two sensor record electrodermal response ( aka galvanic skin response skin conductance ) attach tips second third finger non-dominant hand . Children 's finger wipe clean apply dab conduct gel two finger affix sensor Velcro strap firmly uncomfortably . Next , two sticker electrode measure electrocardiogram signal ( e.g. , heart rate ) apply Lead-II configuration : one affixed right collarbone side torso near low left rib . These circular sticker ( size Loonie ) metal nub wire affix via clip . Finally , respiration belt wrap around torso breast pectoral muscle outside clothing . The belt elastic register expansion contraction due respiration . All three measurement device attach Biopac TEL-100 battery pack attach back participant 's chair . This device attach computer adjacent room via Biopac MP-150 amplifier . Physiological signal record use AcqKnowledge 4.2 software Biopac . The child parent able observe signal record via monitor observation room . Once sensor physiological recording set , parent ask leave room wait room nearby child complete task . The sequence task : 1 . Baseline Physiology ( 3 task ) : ( ) equipment baseline : watch neutral film allow measurement settle ( 2 minute ) , ( b ) pace breathe get rest respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( RSA ; measure parasympathetic activity ) participants breathe synch bar go 9 cycle per minute display monitor ( 2 minute ) , ( c ) pre-task baseline calculate reactivity social cognitive stress ( 2 minute ) 2 . Attention bias task : dot probe task . ( 5 minute ) 3 . Social Stress Task : spontaneous speech topic child 's choosing ( 3 minute ) . 4 . Quick self-report feeling ( &lt; 1 minute ) 5 . Recovery 1 : participant sits alone observation room quietly assess return baseline level arousal ( 3 minute ) . 6 . Cognitive Stress Task : counting backwards 7 's 2148 . Incorrect answer require participant start beginning ( 2 minute ) 7 . Recovery 2 : participant sits alone observation room quietly assess return baseline level arousal ( 3 minute ) . Finally , parent bring back room sensor remove . Debriefing occur final follow-up lab visit . Anticipated time complete lab visit approximately one hour . MINDLIGHT GAME PLAY Participants treatment condition play 5 total hour MindLight , one hour sit , course 2-3 week . Game play occur either school participant 's home . For Prevention Sample , MindLight play participate middle high school Limestone District School Board . Participants Clinical Sample attend school also play game school . However , child recruit Hotel Dieu Mood Anxiety clinic ( see recruitment detail ) attend one participating school play MindLight home . In case , research assistant present set game monitor equipment difficulty . To play game , child wear lightweight MindWave headset single electrode must touch forehead ( see attach image ) . There clip attache comfortably earlobe well . The electroencephalogram ( EEG ) signal alpha , beta , gamma frequency use extract two continuous signal stream measure focus attention arousal . These signal use game control character 's `` mind light , '' magical hat wear light end signal antenna , focus beam light toward specific target solve puzzle within game expand range light inversely proportional degree arousal . Thus , child control key aspect game mind . Control participants Prevention Sample play Max Magic Marker , commercially available game similar feature MindLight without key mechanism target anxiety reduction ( attention bias modification relaxation ) . The amount game play time location intervention group . ONLINE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY Control participants Clinical Sample receive online version cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) base skill teach Mind Mood D. Greenberger C. Padesky . The program provide general information topic , overview helpful skill , homework sheet email directly correspond live , 8-week group therapy session would conduct . Participants also receive feedback homework specific day every week therapist Hotel Dieu . Description participant CLINICAL SAMPLE Children 8-16 year old make appointment Mood Anxiety Clinic Hotel Dieu specifically problem anxiety . Only autism significant developmental delay exclude . The investigator recruit 100 child , half randomly assign MindLight intervention group . PREVENTION SAMPLE Children 10-16 year old attend participate school Limestone District School Board identify elevate anxiety symptom via self-report measure anxiety . Only autism significant developmental delay exclude . The investigator recruit 100 child , half randomly assign MindLight intervention group . Recruitment detail CLINICAL SAMPLE Participants recruit follow initial assessment Hotel Dieu Mood Anxiety Clinic . The typical wait period initial diagnostic assessment start either group one-on-one therapy 3-6 month . Our intervention occur wait period . During initial assessment clinic , child age 8-16 invited participate study . They provide brief explanation study indicate clinician whether give permission contact recruitment coordinator provide detail study . The participant make aware obligation participate study agree contact . Those assent participate invite Adolescent Dynamics Lab begin participation . PREVENTION SAMPLE Children grade 6-10 attend one participating school complete one questionnaire class time , Spence Children 's Anxiety Scale ( SCAS ) . Children score 1 standard deviation mean ( ) total score ( b ) two subscales ( include obsessive-compulsive scale ) consider risk develop anxiety disorder . These child invite participate study visit Adolescent Dynamics Lab . Consent study obtain parent prior SCAS screening .</detailed_description>
