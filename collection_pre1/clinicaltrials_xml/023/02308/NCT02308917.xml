All data relate Network store within single secure data repository facility incorporate state-of-the-art bio-repository sample track system , well facility secure rapid transmission large data file across network . The National Coordinating Centre responsible data-integrity completeness ensure accountability site full timely data completeness . The National Coordinating Centre develop support system collect record data encourage 'real-time ' data abstraction direct data entry . The Network utilizing REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) application primary data-collection platform . REDCap secure , web-based application design support data capture research study , provide : 1 ) intuitive interface validate data entry ; 2 ) audit trail track data manipulation export procedure ; 3 ) automate export procedure seamless data download common statistical package ; 4 ) procedure import data external source . Within data collection platform , numerous 'real-time ' 'post hoc ' data check procedure implement . Statistics concern 'data-integrity ' report Executive Committee regular frequent basis . The National Coordinating Centre conduct site-specific staff training initiation study , new staff employ , new tool significant study procedure add protocol . Site-monitoring visit occur follow start-up least annually sit ensure adherence protocol , Good Clinical Practice applicable regulatory requirement . Site visit perform Network 's Study Manager . The Network utilizing secure data repository facility host SickKids Research Institute 's Department IT ( Information Technology ) . This unit , manage Director Research Information Technology , complies current regulatory Good Clinical Practice mandate regard security , identification segregation data . The Network 's success much dependent ability re-distribute data , ability efficiently accurately collect . In order achieve Network 's goal relate improve care inform clinical practice , imperative Network 's raw data set rapidly re-formatted re-presented first inform report ( patient focus ) clinical quality indicator site network level . As , system data distribution develop allow feedback participate site via Network 's Web-portal regard clinical demographic care Network , Site , Subject level . The Network utilize `` Inflammatory Bowel Disease Biobank '' already establish Hospital Sick Children , currently hold biological sample 1100 individual Inflammatory Bowel Disease patient include DNA ( Deoxyribonucleic acid ) , RNA ( Ribonucleic acid ) , stool biopsy sample . This Biobank already successfully collect , process store prevalent patient DNA ( Deoxyribonucleic acid ) sample tissue many Canadian network site conjunction NEOPICS ( interNational Early Onset Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort Study ) consortium 's effort understand genetic basis early onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( www.NEOPICS.org ; ) . The study utilize electronic subject sample identification methodology already develop , test , implement `` Inflammatory Bowel Disease Biobank '' National Coordinating Centre Director . In first instance , study subject assign unique Participation Identifier site specific . The `` Subject ID '' combination Study ID ( 2 letter ) , site identifier ( 2 digit ) , serial accession number ( 3 digit ) . Each site assign site-specific subject IDs sequential fashion participant enrol . Samples may store indefinitely , additional gene , biomarkers , microbe discover , role intestinal disease assess . The importance sample increase time outcomes intestinal disease treatment may track . As required future , research study propose use biobank data and/or sample submit study committee REB ( Research Ethics Board ) approval . Participants advise consent process , research study , may withdraw time inform study team member verbally write . A withdrawal request may store sample withdraw , may request additional sample collect ( though already store specimen may retain ) . Should either event occur , study team member immediately notify coordinator nature withdrawal request . A note add study file record participant 's decision withdraw , request , his/her sample ( ) destroy . In case participant choose his/her store sample ( ) destroy , consent form mark `` withdrawn '' , copy offer participant , original consent retain file SickKids . Sample Size Power Considerations The study 's sample size arbitrarily fix give national incidence rate , duration recruitment , selection participate site . Based report inception case number , likely engagement success , anticipate recruit approximately 400 500 patient per year . Thus 1,200 1,500 subject least 18 month follow-up data within 5 year grant period . By end year 4 would anticipate 800 1000 subject 18-month outcome , reduce 400 500 3 year mark . The primary analysis , within describe strata test proportion , present Relative Risk . Current figure would suggest 60 % study cohort Crohn 's disease ( CD ) , 20 % L1 , 20 % L2 , 50 % L3 , 10 % isolated L4b . Approximately 20 % CD patient expose anti-TNF within 12 month . Information ongoing study suggest least 60 % patient sustain clinical remission 12 month . The minimum RR ( effect size ) able demonstrate analysis base network cohort , confidence ( power ) estimation , depend number expose subject ( case ) within strata interest anticipate outcome frequency unexposed subject . Environmental Exposure Assessment We systematically assess environmental factor previously associate Inflammatory Bowel Disease literature factor hypothesize associated Inflammatory Bowel Disease base knowledge pathophysiology . All patient complete comprehensive questionnaire around time diagnosis , modify questionnaire 6 month , 12 month annually . The questionnaire internet-based complete patient parental assistance either home clinic . The development environmental questionnaire base NIH-funded ( National Institute Health ) PhenX toolkit . The PhenX toolkit several key advantage : 1 ) allow standardized comparison across study ; 2 ) wide selection environmental risk factor span 20 research domain ; 3 ) exposure develop consensus expert field ; 4 ) variable high quality , well establish , validate ; 5 ) PhenX toolkit free publicly available , allow center replicate finding . We utilize RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method ( RAND Corporation/University California Los Angeles ) modify question PhenX toolkit , environmental questionnaire specific child Inflammatory Bowel Disease . A group expert pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease environmental exposure assessment take evidence-based iterative approach evaluate PhenX toolkit determine appropriateness environmental exposure define specific question child Inflammatory Bowel Disease . Dietary Exposure Assessment We use combination quantitative dietary assessment utilize food frequency questionnaire , FFQ ( Food Frequency Questionnaire ) , ( modify age population study ) qualitative dietary assessment use modify Canadian Healthy Eating Index ( HEIC-2009 ) . This approach allow u test hypothesis high caloric intake process prepared food low glycemic index high fat content facilitative effect development Inflammatory Bowel Disease . Moreover , allow u examine diet-diet interaction , diet-gene interaction , diet-microbiome interaction . We assess effect environmental exposure follow outcome : type , location extent disease diagnosis ( 2 ) ; disease severity diagnosis , subsequent clinical disease course . Disease course follow ultimately classify 'severe ' , 'indolent ' , 'continuous sustain clinical remission ' . Time sentinel event ( surgery , commencement anti-TNF therapy ( anti-tumour necrosis factor ) , development complicate disease behaviour ) also record . We examine univariate effect list environmental exposure include breastfeeding , antibiotic use , passive smoking exposure baseline phenotype subsequent disease course stratum . Logistic regression model construct evaluate potential effect ethnicity ( eg . South Asian versus Caucasian ) adjust environmental exposure . CD ( Crohn 's Disease ) UC ( Ulcerative Colitis ) study separately . Risk estimate express odds ratio 95 % confidence interval . For sentinel event within 18 month diagnosis apply semiparametric nonparametric method survival analysis , include Cox regression model , assess firstly effect various environmental factor stratify ethnicity , well association race/ancestry adjust environmental risk factor . The potential effect modification South Asian ancestry Inflammatory Bowel Disease prognosis formally assess . Finally , pair comparison attempt examining effect change exposure status Inflammatory Bowel Disease disease course . FFQ ( Food Frequency Questionnaire ) content validity reproducibility assess use Pearson correlation coefficient normally distribute data Spearman rank correlation coefficient data normally distribute . Caloric intake , dietary quality specific dietary component fats/specific fatty acid , sugar , vitamin D antioxidant divide age gender-specific quartile distribution across Inflammatory Bowel Disease case , base phenotype ( Ulcerative Colitis Crohn 's Disease ) disease severity ( Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index ( PUCAI ) Pediatric Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( PCDAI ) . ) Logistic regression model develop , adjust age recruitment , gender , ethnicity additional environmental exposure ( mutually adjust analysis update accordance additional data obtain review environmental exposure e.g . smoking status , appendectomy , tonsillectomy , usage oral contraceptive , antibiotic use ) . Risk estimate express odds ratio ( OR ) correspond 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) Crohn 's Disease Ulcerative Colitis separately , well Inflammatory Bowel Disease combine .
