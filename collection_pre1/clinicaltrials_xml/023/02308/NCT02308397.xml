	<brief_summary>The aim study produce tolerable alternative normal wheat bread would suitable subject self-reported non-coeliac gluten sensitivity ( NCGS ) . The bread would make wheat , contrast gluten-free bread , would comparable standard bread . To make bread , investigator use advanced enzyme technology and/or novel formulation target digestion removal wheat protein , might involve etiology non-coeliac gluten sensitivity , preferentially useful bake quality . The investigator determine palatability tolerance new product human cross-over , randomise , blind placebo-controlled intervention study . It estimate 6-10 % population sensitive gluten coeliac disease ( CD ) . Three bread produce test study suitable reference base standard wheat flour baking process</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prior study volunteer undergo screen procedure ( Health Screening Questionnaire ) compliance inclusion/exclusion criterion . The volunteer meet criterion invite sign inform consent . Following volunteer ask complete : - Gluten Sensitivity Questionnaire - SF-36 Quality Life Questionnaire - Beacke Physical Activity Questionnaire - DASS 21 Questionnaire It anticipate NCGS volunteer follow low gluten gluten-free life style . Evaluation dietary compliance gluten-free diet do use numerical score ( Biagi al.,2009 ) - system base strategy subject use avoid eating gluten . Gastrointestinal symptom assess participant complete daily diary card via 100-mm VAS score presence severity overall abdominal symptom , abdominal pain , bloating , wind , satisfaction stool consistency , tiredness , nausea . Severity fatigue evaluate Daily-Fatigue Impact Scale ( D-FIS ) , questionnaire contain 8 item evaluate impact fatigue cognition , physical functioning , daily activity . After one week baseline period , subject assign one week dietary intervention ( bread A , B , C D ) , follow 14-day wash-out period cross next bread . All volunteer randomise four groups/cross intervention . Treatment : - Bread A - normal ( gluten-containing ) reference bread - Bread B - bread reduce gliadin content - Bread C - bread reduce ATIs - Bread D - bread reduce overall protein content Each treatment bread consume one week ( 3 slice per day ) , follow washout period least 2 week symptom induce previous dietary challenge resolve . Volunteers unable continue treatment due intolerable symptom permit cease study food particular arm continue wish study . Bread provide volunteer begin treatment week . Compliance determine question time review count slice bread leave end treatment week . Pilot study For volunteer recruit Aberdeen Aberdeenshire area part pilot study also ask volunteer make single visit ( begin study ) RINH . At visit fast blood sample take , blood pressure check anthropometric measurement make . Blood test : - IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody total IgA level . - IgA endomysial antibody - IgG deamidated gliadin peptide antibody ( DGP-AGA ) - Immunoglobulin IgG/IgA antigliadin antibody ( AGA ) - Flow cytometric basophil activation test - Gliadin-specific T cell peripheral blood - Full blood count - Lipid profile - Vit B12 folic acid status</detailed_description>
