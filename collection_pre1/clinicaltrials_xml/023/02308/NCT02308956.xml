	<detailed_description>Background rationale Task share mental health care integration mental health primary health care ( PHC ) advocate mean narrow treatment gap mental disorder low-income country . In Ethiopia , estimate around 10 % people severe mental disorder ( SMDs ) ever receive evidence-based treatment condition , largely due scarcity specialist mental health service . A task-sharing model mental health care PHC would affordable accessible majority person SMD currently receive evidence-based mental health care . Furthermore , task share mental health care PHC scale Ethiopia line National Mental Health Strategy . However , effectiveness task share model mental health care people SMD evaluate systematically low-income country . In study propose investigate non-inferiority task share model mental health care PHC compare less accessible , specialist , psychiatric nurse-led model care . The specialist model care demonstrate acceptable associate improved clinical outcome person SMD engage service Ethiopia thus make appropriate comparison model evaluate non-inferiority task share model . Methods Setting Meskan Mareko district , Gurage Zone , Silti Zone , Southern Nations , Nationalities People 's Region , Ethiopia . Design A parallel group , randomize , single-blinded , control non-inferiority trial . Participants Adults ( age 25 65 year ) severe mental disorder ( DSM-IV diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder , bipolar disorder major depressive disorder ) severity require continue care ( 1 ) identify population-based survey carry 1998 2001 , still active follow-up , ( 2 ) recruit Butajira hospital psychiatric outpatient clinic . Participants recruit randomised two phase . Phase 1 include participant clinically stable , pregnant breastfeeding , depot medication co-morbid substance use complex medical condition . After three month evaluation period , safety quality issue arise , study proceed Phase 2 . Phase 2 include participant complex need less clinically stable . New intervention Participants new intervention arm receive task share model locally-delivered mental health care integrate PHC . The intervention offer 18 month . Comparison intervention Participants active control arm receive establish model specialist mental health care deliver psychiatric nurse out-patient clinic within Butajira general hospital support outreach project worker . General objective To determine acceptability , affordability , effectiveness sustainability mental health care person SMD deliver trained supervise non-specialist , primary health care worker compare exist psychiatric nurse-led service . Specific objective For person suffer SMD Butajira , Ethiopia , 1 . To determine effectiveness cost-effectiveness task share mental health care PHC , compare psychiatric nurse-led mental health care , primary outcome measure symptom severity series secondary outcome measure . 2 . To examine factor influence implementation task share intervention future scale , examine feasibility , sustainability , quality , safety , qualitative exploration experience task share perspective PHC worker patient . Hypothesis Persons SMD receive mental health care task-shared PHC non-inferior clinical outcome , define difference mean symptom score Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale , expand version ( BPRS-E ) , six point higher , compare person SMD receive psychiatric nurse-led model mental health care , 12 month care comparison service model . Sample size A total 324 participant ( 162 arm ) require detect six point high mean BPRS-E score new intervention arm compare active control arm , 90 % power 95 % confidence , allow 30 % refusal loss follow-up ( n = 124 Phase 1 n = 200 Phase 2 ) . Randomisation Sequence generation : Computerized generation randomization list . Blocked randomization stratify health centre catchment area . Allocation concealment : Labelled , seal envelope contain card intervention allocation administer independent clinician . Implementation : Enrollment occur participant screen eligibility , give informed consent ( permission give guardian ) undergone baseline evaluation . After enrollment , independent clinician inform participant allocation status . Concealment Partial concealment . Outcome assessment data analysis carry investigator mask intervention allocation participant . Statistical method Intention treat primary approach data analysis , per protocol analysis also use thought conservative case non-inferiority trial . The primary outcome measure analyse use linear regression adjust baseline symptom severity measure use BPRS-E .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion phase 1 Participant ongoing Butajira SMD cohort study ( baseline ( 1998 2001 ) , cohort participant age 15 49 year , resident area least six month DSMIV ( SCAN ) diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder , bipolar disorder major depressive disorder ) Ongoing need continue mental health care due : 1. psychotropic medication assessment , 2. medication symptomatic time assessment , 3. experience partial full relapse within two year precede assessment Stable clinical condition : either remission SMD residual symptom stable precede three month . Planning stay resident area 18 month . Able communicate Amharic , official language Ethiopia . Willing randomise either service model describe protocol . Has capacity consent participation permission give guardian refuse participate Resident catchment area TaSCS health centre ( exclude Butajira health centre ) Exclusion criterion phase 1 Suicide attempt within precede three month Current active suicide intent Prescribed Thioridazine , Valproate , Lithium second generation antipsychotic medication ( Risperidone Olanzapine ) , medication available psychiatric nurseled unit PHC setting Ethiopia . Within Butajira SMD cohort , people receive care psychiatristled unit capital city , Addis Ababa , might receive medication . At present , few 10 patient know take one medication . Prescribed depot medication Complex unstable medical condition interfere management psychiatric disorder require ongoing medical treatment Butajira hospital Alcohol khat dependence abuse within last 12 month Pregnant breastfeeding Restrained home Refusing participate study Inclusion criterion Phase 2 As Phase 1 , unable recruit enough participant exist Butajira SMD cohort expand recruitment people SMD attend psychiatric outpatient clinic Butajira hospital . A semistructured diagnostic interview carry determine diagnostic eligibility ( DSMIV diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder , bipolar disorder major depressive disorder ) . For participant recruit Butajira hospital psychiatric outpatient clinic , minimum age 25 year participant first contact specialist mental health service least two year prior recruitment trial ensure comparability Butajira SMD cohort sample . Exclusion criteria Phase 2 Current active suicide intent Prescribed Thioridazine , Valproate , Lithium second generation antipsychotic medication ( Risperidone Olanzapine ) . Pregnant breastfeeding prescribe depot Refusing participate study Medical condition require ongoing medical treatment Butajira hospital</criteria>
