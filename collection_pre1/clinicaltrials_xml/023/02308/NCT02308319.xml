In first randomize control trial evaluate use NUC surgical resection HCC , NUC therapy associate well 2-year overall ( 94 % vs. 62 % ) recurrence-free ( 56 % vs. 20 % ) survival . However , patient active liver disease treat regardless impact HCC recurrence ( patient high serum HBV DNA abnormal ALT ) . What less clear whether patient low level HBV DNA , normal serum ALT level treat reduce HCC recurrence . In trial , investigate determine efficacy treatment Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( Viread ( R ) ) measure cumulative incidence rate hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) 3 year curative treatment radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) surgical resection ( SR ) chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infect patient low viral load .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HCC major global health problem , third lead cause cancer-related death , account 7 % cancer worldwide . Curative treatment , SR , RFA improve patient prognosis , however , even successful curative treatment , high rate disease recurrence limit overall survival HCC patient . In regard , method reduce HCC recurrence essential component therapeutic strategy maximize outcome . Antiviral therapy HBV may play important role , large observation study Taiwan report use NUCs associate 33 % reduction HCC recurrence . In first randomize control trial evaluate use NUC surgical resection HCC , NUC therapy associate well 2-year overall ( 94 % vs. 62 % ) recurrence-free ( 56 % vs. 20 % ) survival . However , patient active liver disease treat regardless impact HCC recurrence ( patient high serum HBV DNA abnormal ALT ) . What less clear whether patient low level HBV DNA , normal serum ALT level treat reduce HCC recurrence . In randomized controlled trial Yin et al , antiviral therapy also beneficial Chronic hepatitis B patient low viral load ( HBV DNA &lt; 104 copies/ml ) . However , need validation find several reason . First , baseline characteristic two group ( advanced tumor control arm ) . Second , recurrence rate control arm high ( 80 % ) , number patient small ( control = 32 , antiviral therapy = 22 ) . Third , HBV DNA level 6 month decrease antiviral therapy group ( 3.36 ± 0.68 log10 copies/ml vs. 4.66 ± 1.38 log10 copies/ml ) , optimal . The used drug lamivudine , adefovir plus lamivudine entecavir 0.5 mg. With potent antiviral drug , good outcome expect . In trial , investigate determine efficacy treatment Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( Viread ( R ) ) measure cumulative incidence rate hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) 3 year curative treatment radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) surgical resection ( SR ) chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infect patient low viral load .</detailed_description>
