	<detailed_description>Localized articular cartilage defect common challenge problem , particularly young patient . These defect cause significant disability , participation sport activity grows , increase overall number annually . A recent systematic review evaluate overall full-thickness focal chondral defect athletes reveal prevalence 36 % , 22 % athlete symptomatic . As prevalence injury increase , pose increasingly significant challenge clinician treat . Normal joint cartilage firm , elastic tissue cover end bone protect allow smooth , pain-free movement . Joint cartilage describe , macroscopically microscopically , articular `` hyaline '' cartilage . Hyaline cartilage often describe `` glass-like '' structural tissue shiny appearance translucency . The tissue structure hydrate matrix consist proteoglycans least 90 % ( dry weight ) Type II collagen fiber . The collagen fiber contribute overall tensile strength proteoglycans provide stiffness tissue resiliency . Cartilage cell , chondrocytes , produce dense matrix , effectively incarcerate cell . In event injury , motility cell restrict due inclusion deep inside matrix , avascularity cartilage . This lack vascular network prevents infiltration inflammatory cell bioactive molecule follow damage . Thus , damage , adult articular cartilage effectively heal regenerate . Treatment techniques osteochondral lesion relatively new frequently change evolve . The treatment algorithms injury complex often involve multiple procedure , include non-surgical intervention pharmacological agent oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , injectable corticosteroid , activity modification include rehabilitation support brace may provide incomplete temporary relief . Lesion characteristic grade thickness may also impact treatment option recovery . Arthroscopic debridement lavage effective first-line surgical approach subject low physical demand . This procedure eliminate debris decrease inflammation joint , symptomatic relief usually transient lesion repair . Treatments provide long-term result may achieve variety surgical option . There many surgical treatment option currently available limitation . Marrow stimulation technique include microfracture , drilling , abrasion arthroplasty . The Microfracture technique describe address lesion 1 cm2 author cite specific application depend lesion size , patient age physical demand . While microfracture consider reparative treatment , procedure produce less optimal result inferior nature fibrocartilaginous tissue form . Unlike Type II collagen normally find articular cartilage , fibrocartilage consist predominately Type I collagen . Because lack long-term wear characteristic normal hyaline cartilage , fibrocartilage degrade time . ACI two-staged procedure develop treat cartilage defect knee . For ACI , primary arthroscopic procedure perform assess defect small amount ( 200mg 400 mg ) healthy , autologous cartilage harvest . The tissue expand use cell-culture process period several week . The expanded cell implant area defect second surgical procedure . Studies demonstrate histology quantitative measurement ACI produce `` hyaline-like cartilage '' collagen type II content 35 percent 55 percent . Literature indicate hyaline cartilage may great biomechanical strength integrity fibrocartilaginous tissue generate lesion treated microfracture . There several disadvantage use ACI , however , need two surgery . It increase surgical time due associate substantial cost account ex vivo cell expansion . Potential postoperative complication relate periosteal patch include cell leakage , hypertrophy and/or delamination , unequal chondrocyte distribution within lesion . Osteochondral grafting , direct transplantation osteochondral autograft allograft , technique available market transplant intact hyaline cartilage . Fresh osteochondral allograft use active chondrocytes avoid donor site morbidity . The graft avascular aneural , mean immunopriveleged suitable transplantation . Autograft plug typically use treat small defect ( 2.5 cm diameter ) due donor site size limitation . Osteochondral allograft harvest 35 mm diameter entire compartment resurface use shell technique.Clinical outcome osteochondral autograft document various study good excellent , particularly subject isolate femoral lesion . A major benefit osteochondral allograft ability provide surgeon capability treat much large defect . A major drawback many aforementioned treatment option ( microfracture , ACI , osteochondral autograft ) inability treat large lesion . Additionally , fresh OCA longevity implantation document long 25 year , indicate procedure provide long term relief patient . The purpose study evaluate functional clinical outcome patient receive femoral condyle osteochondral allograft , evaluate potential predisposing factor failure graft , compare overall outcome graft current standard care small lesion , microfracture . Our hypothesis patient treat allografts demonstrate significant functional improvement measure validated outcome score measure function least equal microfracture outcome .</detailed_description>
