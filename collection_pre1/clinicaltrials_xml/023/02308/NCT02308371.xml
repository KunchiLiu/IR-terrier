	<brief_summary>Children critically ill often require large amount fluid acute illness . It show multiple study appropriate administration fluid decrease morbidity mortality , give much fluid also cause increased morbidity mortality . It often difficult discern physical exam , vital sign labs amount fluid give appropriate pediatric patient require fluid . Pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) change blood pressure patient ventilator breathe machine . PPV use multiple adult study help predict fluid need critically ill patient . In study , would like investigate PPV help good predict critically ill pediatric patient pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) need fluid .

	<detailed_description>In pediatric critical care , difficult discern patient 's intravascular fluid status ( hypovolemia , hypervolemia , euvolemia ) . Often , pediatric sepsis patient exhibit profound hypovolemia early aggressive fluid resuscitation show decrease mortality ( 1,2 ) . Within first 48 hour presentation , pediatric patient sepsis profound change physiology change cardiac function systemic vascular resistance make difficult discern whether continued fluid resuscitation addition vasopressor support need ( 1,2 ) . Similar physiology also see patient systemic inflammatory response postoperative cardiac patient general pediatric post-surgical patient . While appropriate fluid resuscitation need , show fluid overload increase mortality ( 3-5 ) . Clinicians often use clinical exam , vital sign , urine output central venous pressure ( CVP ) guide need fluid resuscitation , static measure central venous pressure , pulmonary wedge pressure , clinical exam show strong predictor fluid responsiveness cardiac output patient ( 6-8 ) . A accurate way discern fluid status heart function measurement cardiac output , order calculate cardiac output , additional test echocardiogram need additional invasive monitoring use thermodilution continuous cardiac output monitor need ( 7,8 ) . In last 30 year , dynamic change arterial pressure respiratory cycle describe , decrease cardiac preload time inspiration positive pressure breath follow increase cardiac preload expiration positive pressure breath 9,10 . Using change arterial pressure , information cardiac preload volume status infer . The common form dynamic pressure monitoring use systolic pressure variation pulse pressure variation . Several adult study show systolic pressure variation ( SPV ) pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) accurately predict fluid response ( defined majority study increase stroke volume index cardiac index/output &gt; 15 % receive fluid bolus ) mechanically ventilate critically ill patient compare static measure , CVP ( 2,10-24 ) . PPV also show predictive fluid responsiveness many patient many different pathology include intraoperative patient , postoperative cardiac bypass patient , patient septic shock patient acute lung injury require low tidal volume ( 11,13-15,17-23,25 ) . PPV also validate helpful accurate guide fluid responsiveness clinical scenario require vasopressor ( 12,26 ) . Lopes et al demonstrate PPV accurately predict fluid response , use PPV direct fluid resuscitation operating room , patient well postoperative outcome define decreased ventilator time ( 1 vs 5 day , P &lt; 0.05 ) , decrease length hospital stay ( 7 vs 17 day , P &lt; 0.1 ) ( 22 ) . There study evaluate pulse pressure variation pediatric patient population result mixed . Similar adult study , study evaluate dynamic parameter , include SPV and/or PPV , compare change dynamic parameter change see stroke volume index calculate continuous cardiac index monitoring echocardiogram . Fluid boluses give SPV PPV decrease stroke volume index increase , dynamic parameter proven predictive fluid responsiveness . Some study show PPV SPV reliable predictor fluid responsiveness ( 27-29 ) . In contrast , study infant neonates undergoing congenital heart surgery ( ventricular septal defect atrial septal defect repair ) illustrate PPV predictive fluid response repair cardiac lesion ( 30 ) . This study particularly interesting since PPV able predict fluid response two different physiologic state , without intracardiac shunt ( 30 ) . Two pediatric study also demonstrate dynamic parameter predictive fluid response ( 31,32 ) . There pediatric study thus far investigated dynamic variable ( PPV SPV ) guide fluid resuscitation improve patient outcome . Dynamic pressure monitoring , include PPV SPV , consider standard care within adult anesthesia set currently use adult operate room University North Carolina Hospitals . Most monitor within hospital equip measure PPV , include monitor PICU . Several PICU attending fellows familiar PPV use aid fluid management last couple month . The investigator 's hope use PPV physicians well able gauge patient 's intravascular status judiciously give fluid lead appropriate fluid management well patient outcome Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) . Hypothesis : Using pulse pressure variation reduce amount fluid first 48 hour acute illness ( first 48 hour placement arterial line intubation conventional mechanical ventilation ) 30 % . Appropriate fluid management reduce amount time ventilator , number day PICU , time vasopressor . Methods : Patient Population Recruitment : All patient admit pediatric intensive care unit screen recruitment study pediatric critical care attend fellow . Patients require standard mechanical ventilation arterial line eligible study . Study include 75 patient admitted PICU require arterial line conventional mechanical ventilation prospectively follow . There 75 matched , historic patient use control . The investigator expect difficulty enrol 75 patient study 1069 patient admit PICU last year ( July 2013 July 2014 ) . Study Procedure : Prior accrual patient , nurse PICU PICU physician ( attending fellows ) formal education training use PPV study protocol . In addition , physician consent training . All patient admit pediatric intensive care unit mechanically ventilated conventional ventilator setting arterial line eligible study . Primary investigator ( day ) physician call PICU ( night ) obtain consent patient eligible study . The bedside physician ( co-investigator ) give fluid need base standard clinical data ( heart rate , central venous pressure available , blood pressure , urine output , physical exam , lactate level ) pulse pressure variation . Boluses 5 cc/kg give give fluid incrementally . Pulse pressure variation value fluid bolus fluid bolus record electronic medical record . Pulse pressure variation follow 48 hour . Pulse pressure variation , central venous pressure , total fluid PICU stay , total fluid 48 hour PPV protocol ( cc/kg/day ) , day mechanically ventilate , hour vasopressor , echocardiogram , age , weight admission , daily weight , sex , diagnosis record patient 's medical record . All data collect patient 's record primary investigator . Data Analysis : Continuous baseline variable description mean standard deviation , categorical baseline variable describe frequency distribution . A two-sided t-test corresponding confidence interval use compare match historic control prospectively recruit test group subject total amount fluid 48 hour ( cc/kg/day ) . Wilcoxon Rank Sum test time-to-event data apply time ventilator ( day ) , time PICU ( day ) , time vasopressor ( hour ) , together Kaplan-Meyer curve descriptive purpose .</detailed_description>
