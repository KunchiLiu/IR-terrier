	<brief_summary>Current evidence support central role inflammation pathogenesis atherosclerosis diabetes [ 57-60 ] . Diabetes Mellitus type 2 inflammatory atherothrombotic condition associate high prevalence thrombotic cardiovascular disease . In patient DM type 2 , inflammation reflect elevated plasma level several biomarkers inflammation C-reactive protein ( CRP ) [ 51-55 ] . HsCRP consider strong predictive cardiovascular risk death [ 53 , 61-72 ] . Besides predictive role determine cardiovascular risk , evidence CRP may represent active participant atherogenesis [ 54 ] . CRP express human atherosclerotic plaque vascular cell monocytes/macrophages appear represent significant source CRP inflammatory vessel wall [ 54 ] . Among DM risk factor ( like hypertension , atherogenic dyslipidemia , insulin resistance , impaired fibrinolysis , inflammatory profile ) , definitely , inflammation neglect one . Moringa oleifera suggest exert anti-inflammatory effect [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 45 ] hypoglycemic property [ 80 ] . As many report nutritional medicinal value natural product , alarm number purveyor `` healthful '' food promote M. oleifera panacea . While much recent enthusiasm indeed appear justified , critical separate scientific evidence anecdote . Herein , investigator investigate effect Moringa oleifera leave supplementation level inflammatory marker specifically hsCRP , hgbA1c level clinical outocome diabetic patient cohort study .</brief_summary>
