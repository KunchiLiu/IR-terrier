	<brief_title>Cerebral Embolic Load Patients Undergoing Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement : A Comparison Conventional With Minimized Extracorporeal Circulation Technique Using Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The gold standard treat severe aortic valve stenosis currently surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR ) use conventional extracorporeal circulation ( CECC ) . SAVR , however , perform also minimize extracorporeal circulation ( MECC ) , characterize reduced priming volume interface blood artificial surface blood-air interface , respectively . Further technical development MECC system together report less induction coagulation cascade activation inflammatory systemic response may account reduced incidence microbubble generation MECC system . Objective The aim investigate procedural-related incidence high-intensity transient signal ( HITS ) represent solid gaseous microembolism reach cerebral vessel . Methods Patients undergo SAVR include study randomise either MECC CECC technique . HITS continuously bilaterally detect entire intraoperative period transcranial Doppler ultrasound .</detailed_description>
