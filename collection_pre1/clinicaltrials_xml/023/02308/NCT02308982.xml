	<brief_summary>This phase III multi-centre randomise , double blind , placebo control trial ass role intravenous immunoglobulin treatment child encephalitis . The primary objective find whether early use IVIG treatment improve neurological outcome child encephalitis . 308 child encephalitis , age 6 week 16 year recruit 30 hospital United Kingdom . Participants randomise receive two dos IVIG match placebo addition standard treatment , within first five day hospital admission . Each participant follow 12 month . During period , information clinical , radiological laboratory investigation collect . Neurological outcome assess use questionnaires 6 12 month , neuropsychological assessment 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Role Early Intravenous Immunoglobulin Treatment Children With Encephalitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Encephalitis syndrome neurological dysfunction cause inflammation brain parenchyma , result alter mental status , seizure , and/or focal neurologic deficit , usually accompany laboratory radiological evidence brain inflammation . The worldwide annual incidence encephalitis range 3.5 7.4 per 100,000 , rise 16 per 100,000 child . In United Kingdom , Public Health England ( formerly Health Protection Agency ) report annual rate 1.5 case per 100,000 general population 2.8 per 100,000 child , high incidence infant 1 year age 8.7 per 100,000 . Despite use current standard treatment , mortality 7-10 % morbidity 50 % still report . Encephalitis also impose substantial economic resource burden healthcare service . Strategies reduce disability patient encephalitis therefore require . There increase evidence case report beneficial role IVIG treatment encephalitis . However , clinical practice , use IVIG encephalitis varies . The variation practice part due lack class 1 evidence support use IVIG encephalitis . For immune mediate form encephalitis , IVIG typically use inevitable delay ( week case ) alternative diagnosis exclude , definitive diagnosis obtain . In case , IVIG use usually last treatment option clinical improvement slow . Again , usually several day hospital admission . Delays institution appropriate treatment encephalitis may contribute high rate morbidity mortality , prolonged hospitalisation associate cost encephalitis . In particular , currently unknown whether wider use IVIG infectious encephalitis earlier use immune-mediated encephalitis could alter outcome group condition . This study fill evidence gap potential benefit IVIG reduce disease burden child encephalitis . The trial also aim generate evidence inform clinical decision make National Health Service ( NHS ) provide add value NHS address healthcare , quality life productivity cost expensive resource limited product .</detailed_description>
