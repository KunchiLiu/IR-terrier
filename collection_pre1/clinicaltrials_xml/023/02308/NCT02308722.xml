	<brief_title>SBRT Pre-operatively Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm prospective phase I dose escalation radiation study investigate 5-fraction stereotactic radiotherapy prior plan surgical resection borderline resectable pancreatic cancer . Surgical resection potentially curative technique manage pancreatic cancer . However 80 % patient present disease cure surgical resection . Negative margin ( R0 resection ) , tumour size , absence lymph node metastases strong prognostic indicator long term survival . Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) radiation technique pancreatic cancer ablative dose radiotherapy ( RT ) deliver small volume target risk surgical margin short time ( 1 week versus 5-6 week standard radiotherapy ) , achieve much high biologically equivalent dose ( BED ) ( 100Gy versus 50Gy ) conventionally fractionate radical RT . The short time delivery minimal acute toxicity make attractive treatment option BPRC offer opportunity integrate systemic treatment . With standard fractionation schedule large volume normal tissue usually irradiate SBRT effective dose limit toxicity despite use Intensity Modulated RT . This study build current evidence base SBRT pancreas , far largely use locally advanced set promising result aim take step . This study aim test safety benefit pre-operative SBRT , deliver high local dos risk surgical margin usually around main vessel retroperitoneum . The concept margin-intensive therapy novel , aim deliver high radiation dose limit toxicity organ risk .</detailed_description>
