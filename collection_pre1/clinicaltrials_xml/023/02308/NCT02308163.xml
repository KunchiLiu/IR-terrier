	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy ASP015K Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) Who Had Inadequate Response DMARDs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel-group , confirmatory study evaluate efficacy safety ASP015K alone combination DMARDs patient RA inadequate response DMARDs . Etanercept also administer reference drug open-label manner . The study drug orally administer daily ( QD ) breakfast 52 week . Etanercept administer subcutaneously QD 52 week . At Week 12 , subject placebo group switch ASP015K . The dose ASP015K start Week 12 placebo group determine randomly baseline advance switch blinded manner . Subjects ASP015K group placebo group complete study eligible participation open-label extension study ( 015K-CL-RAJ2 ) .</detailed_description>
