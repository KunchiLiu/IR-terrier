This lab draw would add mother 's routine lab study would require additional venipuncture . A second urine drug screen perform mother upon admission University Oklahoma Health Sciences Center delivery baby . If screen negative baby meet exclusion criterion , baby enrol study . The initial meconium baby recruit mother gather . Approximately 1 g meconium collect , frozen , evaluated fatty acid ethyl ester analysis United States Drug Testing Laboratories , Inc.
