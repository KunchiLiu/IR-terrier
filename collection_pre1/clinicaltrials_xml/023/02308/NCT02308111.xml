	<brief_summary>Primary Biliary Cirrhosis ( PBC ) serious , life -- threatening , bile acid relate liver disease unknown cause . Without treatment , frequently progress liver fibrosis eventual cirrhosis require liver transplantation result death . The investigational drug , Obeticholic Acid ( OCA ) modify bile acid FXR agonist derive primary human bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid . The key mechanism action OCA , include choleretic , anti-inflammatory , anti-fibrotic property , underlie hepatoprotective effect result attenuation injury improve liver function cholestatic liver disease PBC . The study assess effect OCA compare placebo , combine stable standard care , clinical outcome PBC patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study Obeticholic Acid Evaluating Clinical Outcomes Patients With Primary Biliary Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3b , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , multicenter study undertake 170 site internationally evaluate effect OCA clinical outcome 350 subject PBC . The study include screen period 8 week , require two clinic visit . Eligible participant randomly allocate ( 1:1 ) treatment either OCA 5 mg match placebo tablet , take orally daily majority subject ; dose frequency modify subject cirrhosis classify Child-Pugh B C. Randomization stratify standard treatment UDCA ( yes/no ) baseline liver function . The treatment period involve clinic visit approximately every 3 month . At 3 month visit study visit thereafter , study treatment tolerate , participant ' dose titrate per protocol blind manner eg participant non-cirrhotic classify Child-Pugh A randomized OCA , receive maximum daily dose 10 mg OCA , placebo continue receive placebo . Subsequently , daily dosage may return 5 mg necessary participant non-cirrhotic classify Child-Pugh A , increase 10 mg possible , base tolerability clinical judgment . Safety tolerability assess monitoring adverse event vital sign , blood urine testing . The study event drive total duration determine time require accrue approximately 121 primary endpoint event , estimate approximately 8 year . Subjects expect minimum follow-up time approximately 6 year .</detailed_description>
