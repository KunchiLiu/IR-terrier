	<brief_summary>Background Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) common , leading cause cancer death . The evaluation patient suspect CRC difficult due poorly predictive alarm symptom many patient present uncharacteristic vague symptom . The faecal marker human globin , iFOBT , could play important role aid general practitioner detect CRC . Hypothesis It possible implement iFOBT general practice test perform patient fulfill criterion fast-track referral colorectal cancer , whose symptom could indicate undiagnosed colorectal cancer . Aim To implement iFOBT general practice evaluate uptake clinical use test . Furthermore , want investigate performance iFOBT use patient present uncharacteristic symptom CRC , clinical implication . Materials methods The study use cluster randomise stepped wedge design . Clusters constitute 18 municipality central Denmark Region , randomise receive continuous medical education ( CME ) . The date inclusion define first working day month CME plan conduct . The CME part intervention aim facilitate implementation iFOBT general practice . Besides CME , intervention consist start package ( iFOBT kit , guideline online educational material ) send GPs include study , status mail GPs receive approx . one month inclusion . The inclusion period first 7 month study period , study last one year . Perspectives This study provide important knowledge improve CRC diagnostics general practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Implementation iFOBT General Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) second common type cancer Denmark lead cause cancer death . Since 2000 , incidence increase 1-1.5 % year . The estimated 5-year survival rate currently 80 % stage I cancer , 50 % stage II III , &lt; 5 % stage IV cancer . These figure emphasize importance detect disease early stage underline current challenge diagnose CRC general practice . In 2008 , national fast-track system cancer patient establish ensure fast diagnosis initiation treatment . The fast-track system imply patient present 'alarm ' symptom e.g . CRC refer immediately diagnostic workup ; 14 day must pass referral initiation treatment . Several study show positive predictive value ( PPV ) symptoms regard CRC fairly low ( 4-8 % ) . In addition , approximately 50 % new CRC incident present vague uncharacteristic symptom alarm symptom . In addition , screen programme CRC implement . It suggest increase survival rate CRC , however , estimate approximately 75 % yearly CRC still diagnose general practice . A huge load , consequently , still place general practice quest early diagnosis CRC , good method aid general practitioner diagnostic process need . One tool could use iFOBT general practice patient present symptom could origin underlie CRC , without alarm symptom . Aim To implement iFOBT general practice evaluate uptake clinical use test . Furthermore , want investigate performance iFOBT use patient present uncharacteristic symptom CRC , clinical implication . Materials method We develop guideline use iFOBT general practice . The guideline aim men woman age 30 year present symptom could origin CRC , classify alarm symptom . The guideline contain list symptom recommend perform iFOBT suggest action positive negative test result . A value &lt; 49µg/L consider 'negative ' &gt; 50µg/L 'positive ' . The study use cluster randomise stepped wedge design , executed Central Denmark Region . Municipalities region randomise receive CME , include sequentially study first seven month study period . The CME arrange schedule GP-meetings municipality consist 45 minute lecture CRC diagnosis use iFOBT . Besides CME , intervention consist start package ( 10 iFOBT kit , guideline online educational material ) send GPs include study , status mail GPs receive approx . one month inclusion . The study period one year . Data analysis focus uptake clinical use iFOBT general practice , performance iFOBT use patient present uncharacteristic symptom CRC clinical implication . Perspectives This study investigate iFOBT explore role general practice . To knowledge , study one first thorough investigation test primary care set . The result bring important knowledge improve diagnostics colorectal cancer future hopefully reduce time diagnosis . Especially patient meet traditional Danish criterion fast-track referral , study corner stone identification efficient way locate patient risk develop CRC . At national international level , project contribute important knowledge may provide good planning CRC diagnostics future .</detailed_description>
