	<brief_summary>Following consent , patient receive 15 fraction radiotherapy affect breast Axillary level III SCV ( Supra-Clavicular ) lymph node , define CT image obtain prone position use IMRT ( intensity modulation radiation therapy ) technique : one fraction daily 5 days/week 3 consecutive week . Patients see follow-up 45-60 day first radiotherapy treatment , yearly . Patients assess Lymphedema baseline , end treatment , yearly interval completion radiotherapy . All patient follow toxicity outcome ( local systemic recurrence , survival ) . In addition , patient complete self-assessment QOL baseline , week 3 , day 45-60 2-yr follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A recent Cochrane Collaboration Intervention Review address effect alter fractionation size woman early breast cancer undergone breast conservation surgery . Analysis two prospective randomize trial include 2644 woman , select base tumor size less five cm , negative pathological margin excision negative lymph node . No difference clinical outcome detect . The conclusion review use unconventional fractionation regimen ( great 2 Gy per fraction ) affect breast appearance toxicity , seem affect local recurrence five year survival rate . After breast surgery adequate axillary dissection ( i.e. , least 8 node retrieve axillary dissection specimen level I II ) possible identify patient 1 - 5 positive node require radiotherapy indexed breast/chest wall drain nodal station surgeon include traditional level I - II axillary dissection , i.e. , level III supraclavicular station . We propose test new technique extend prone set also include lymph node region . Limiting treatment supraclavicular fossa level III axilla patient adequately dissect axilla support several publish study . Regional nodal recurrence rare ( occur 1 - 5 % ) patient early stage invasive breast cancer undergone breast conserve therapy . Several institution choose treat level III axilla supraclavicular nodal station patient undergone surgical treatment level I/II axilla . This technique document recently Liengsawangwong , utilized CT-delineated nodal station improve target coverage SCV ( Supra-Clavicular ) level III axillary node patient undergone axillary level I/II dissection find positive lymph node .</detailed_description>
