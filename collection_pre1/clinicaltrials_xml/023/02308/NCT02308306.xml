	<brief_summary>The overall goal ABILITY study help improve pain diagnostics treatment develop implementable clinical computerise decision support system base individual patient characteristic . The investigator hypothesize successful pain control opioids predict treatment initiation advance data analysis data originate pre-treatment EEG , QST pain-related catastrophic thinking . The primary objective study identification marker use individualize treatment recommendation , i.e . reliably predict response pain opioids . Markers select among promising data machine-learning method use prediction . This include determine association battery select pre-treatment clinical predictive marker analgesic effect opioid treatment opioid naïve chronic pain patient , include indication responder identification . The key secondary objective follow : investigate pre-treatment clinical predictive marker predictor opioid treatment efficacy effectiveness term follow : - Pain intensity unpleasantness - Use rescue analgesic - Physical function - Global improvement satisfaction treatment</brief_summary>
