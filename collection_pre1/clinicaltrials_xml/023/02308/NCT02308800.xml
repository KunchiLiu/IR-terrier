	<brief_summary>The investigator plan randomize clinical trial 150 patient infected diabetes-related low extremity wound compare clinical economic effectiveness negative pressure wound therapy continuous irrigation negative pressure wound therapy without irrigation . The investigator enroll 150 patient two center : The University Texas Southwestern University Hospital Parkland Hospital . The investigator screen enroll patient wound inpatient set . Patients randomize receive traditional NPWT NPWT continuous irrigation hospitalize . The average hospitalization patent receive NPWT 13.3 day . Patients wound surgically close hospitalization discharge negative pressure wound therapy without irrigation total four week therapy . After discharge hospital , subject see twice weekly home health , investigator evaluate subject clinic every 7 day ( ±7 day ) total 16-week period wound heals .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening Procedures - Review sign Informed Consent HIPAA Authorization - The study doctor review inclusion exclusion criterion - Demographics ( age , gender , race ethnicity ) - Sitting blood pressure pulse admission - Collection Height weight admission - Collection medical surgical history - Collection history wound - Wound assessment ( ) - wound etiology , wound history , location study wound infection assessment - Hyperspectral imaging within 30 day screen - Vascular/Neurological evaluation - various test measurement assess sensation ( feel ) circulation ( blood flow ) subject 's foot low leg . To assess sensation , monofilament sensory test vibration threshold perception test study foot . We calculate neuropathy disability score foot . To assess circulation , record Skin Perfusion Pressures study foot use Sensilase System ( Vasamed , Eden Prairie , MN ) within 30 day screen . We calculate ankle brachial index ( ABI ) screen collect available arterial doppler data medical record within 6 month screen . None test invasive ( use needle ) , uncomfortable risk great standard care . - Results standard-of-care laboratory test include white blood cell count , blood chemistry ( test see well organ , liver kidneys work ) , glycated hemoglobin , albumin , prealbumin , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , C-reactive protein blood glucose . Results serum pregnancy test ( standard care woman child-bearing potential part pre-op lab ) also collect . Collection list subject 's current antibiotic - We provide SF-36 Questionnaire patient-reported outcome questionnaire collect subject inpatient . This visit last 2 hour . If qualify study , participate follow procedure : Group Assignment If researcher believe subject take part study , s/he assign randomly ( like flip coin ) receive one follow therapy : - Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Irrigation - Negative Pressure Wound Therapy without Irrigation The group assign randomly ( like flip coin ) . The sponsor researcher know advance group assignment subject receive . Neither subject researcher allow choose group s/he assign . Study Intervention The subject receive either : - Quantum™+Simultaneous Irrigation ( NPWTi ) - Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Prontosan® , - Quantum™ ( NPWT ) -Negative Pressure Wound Therapy ( without Prontosan® ) Assigned therapy continue hospital physician determines wound ready closure . If subject 's wound healing , study therapy discontinue standard dressing apply . If surgical closure need , subject return Operating Room procedure close wound . If wound ready closure hospital stay , subject continue NPWT home . NPWT home without irrigation . Procedures Evaluations Research The study therapy give subject hospital . If subject 's wound ready closure hospital stay , subject continue NPWT home . NPWT home without irrigation . Once therapy stop s/he continue follow study doctor . After subject release hospital s/he need see study doctor regular post-operative visit . The study doctor continue check wound . If wound close , s/he see study doctor 30 day later close wound check . Day First Surgery : - 3D image surgery eKare Insight device - Tissue bone sample - doctor take 2 small sample tissue subject 's wound debridement ( removal dead unhealthy tissue ) , debridement ( clean margin ) 1 sample bone debridement case bone infection , tissue sample keep tested amount type bacteria present ( qPCR analysis/laboratory analysis ) . - Wound measurement surgery - The study doctor decide subject still qualify study - Randomization ( like flip coin ) either Quantum™ NPWT Irrigation Quantum™ NPWT without Irrigation - Placement therapy wound - Collection current antibiotic - Collection adverse event information Daily Treatments ( hospital ) : - Collection current antibiotic - Collection adverse event information This take 15 minute . Additional Surgery ( need remove dead tissue close wound ) : - Tissue sample - doctor take 2 small sample tissue subject 's wound debridement ( clean margin ) , tissue sample keep tested amount type bacteria present ( qPCR analysis/laboratory analysis ) - 3D image wind surgery/debridement bedside eKare Insight device wound still open - Wound measurement surgery/debridement bedside - Wound closure placement therapy wound - Collect current antibiotic - Collect adverse event information If subject 's wound close upon hospital discharge , NPWT continue home without irrigation . Home Health Visits If subject continue receive NPWT hospital discharge , subject see twice weekly home health nurse dressing change . The home health nurse collect sit blood pressure pulse rate . Amount , type character drainage document , well adverse event change concomitant medication . Offloading reapplied dress change . Follow-Up Visits per standard care ( therapy stop ) : - Dressing change / removal / Offloading - Wound measurement infection assessment - Results standard-of-care laboratory test include white blood cell count , blood chemistry ( test see well organ , liver kidneys work ) , glycated hemoglobin , albumin , prealbumin , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , C-reactive protein blood glucose . - 3D image wound eKare device ( indicate , wound still open ) - Collection current antibiotic - Collection adverse event information These visit take 30 minute . End Study - Wound Closure Follow-up Visit ( 30 day +/-7 day wound close , close within 12 week Day first surgery ) Week 16 : - Closed wound assessment - For subject whose wound close : 3D image wound eKare device Return standard care - Collection current antibiotic - Collection adverse event information - SF-36 Questionnaire patient-reported outcome questionnaires This visit take 30 minute .</detailed_description>
