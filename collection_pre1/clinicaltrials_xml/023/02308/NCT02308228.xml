	<brief_title>Novel Actions Metformin Augment Resistance Training Adaptations Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle mass strength critical determinant person 's quality life functional independence , also metabolic health , muscle organ primarily responsible insulin-mediated glucose uptake . The elderly suffer obligatory loss muscle mass strength , exacerbate illness physical inactivity . Progressive resistance exercise training ( PRT ) effective intervention identify improve muscular strength , combat muscle atrophy age ( sarcopenia ) ; however , overall muscle response PRT blunt elderly variability response increase , individual actually lose muscle mass . The Bamman Peterson labs independently study molecular cellular mechanism underlie `` non-responder '' phenotype , goal identify novel intervention strategy promote mass strength gain improve function . We hypothesize abundance anti-inflammatory , alternatively activate M2 macrophage muscle predict response PRT elderly ; high number M2 macrophages low inflammatory gene expression prior start training gain mass . Further , determine metformin treatment increase M2 macrophage abundance , decrease inflammatory cytokine gene expression . These provocative finding lead u central hypothesis adjuvant metformin may improve response PRT elderly alter muscle tissue inflammatory environment , thereby enhance mechanism drive PRT-induced myofiber hypertrophy .</detailed_description>
