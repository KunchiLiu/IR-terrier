	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect early mobilization versus traditional immobilization rehabilitation program surgical Achilles tendon repair mechanical ( torque-angle torque-velocity relationship ) electrical ( neuromuscular activation ) property plantar- dorsiflexor muscle , gastrocnemius medialis morphology ( muscle architecture ) , functional performance , mechanical material property ( force-elongation stress-strain relationship ) injure uninjured Achilles tendon . The hypothesis early mobilization could reduce deleterious effect joint immobilization improve tendon healing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants allocate one two intervention group ( traditional immobilization early mobilization ) . Traditional immobilization group ( 45 day plaster cast immobilization ; immobilization period , subject receive instruction perform home-based exercise program ) Early mobilization ( six week physical therapy program ; three time per week ; one two hour exercise regain range motion muscular endurance ) Control group ( subject history lower limb injury , match age anthropometric measurement subject perform physical rehabilitation subject remain immobilized .</detailed_description>
