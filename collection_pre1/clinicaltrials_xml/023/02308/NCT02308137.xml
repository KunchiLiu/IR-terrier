	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial determine Domperidone dose 40 mg daily prevent worsen walk ability people secondary progressive MS . The number participant study 62 . A maximum 75 people secondary progressive MS include . Each patient follow 12 month inclusion . Domperidone medication show increase level hormone prolactin . The best understood function prolactin stimulation milk production woman delivery . However , increase prolactin level see patient treated standard dos Domperidone ( dose 80mg per day ) usually lead clinical symptom . Prolactin show improve myelin repair mouse . Domperidone therefore may also improve myelin repair people MS. Domperidone currently approve Canada treat slow moving bowel nausea , instance patient Parkinson 's Disease Diabetes Mellitus , slowly move bowel cause constipation . Domperidone available tablet usually take four time per day . Doses 80mg per day may use estimate dose 40mg daily need stimulate myelin repair . Domperidone usually well tolerate .</brief_summary>
