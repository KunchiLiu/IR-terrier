	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine best way assess people affect myotonic dystrophy type 1 ( DM1 ) . The study ass walk speed , muscle strength , muscle size , myotonia , heart rhythm , mental efficiency , overall health . Participants complete questionnaire record idea affect DM1 . The study evaluate people DM1 1 year determine condition change time . The study identify biomarkers DM1 . Biomarkers laboratory measurement show effect DM1 person 's muscle tissue blood . Biomarkers need future study determine DM1 may respond treatment .</brief_summary>
