	<brief_summary>The improved long-term survival thalassemia major ( TM ) patient result increased focus ability preserve fertility . While association iron toxicity vital organ dysfunction , heart liver , extensively investigate , correlation reproductive capacity extent iron overload well understood . Despite remarkable progress methodology prediction reproductive status intervention preserve fertility , implementation thalassemia lacking . The investigator hypothesize iron toxicity anterior pituitary occur process transfusional iron load directly associate decline gonadal function . The investigator expect pituitary MRI measurement iron deposition well marker oxidative damage correlate functional study pituitary-gonadal axis perform study . This cross sectional study examine relation pituitary iron deposition pituitary volume ; serum iron oxidative stress measure , liver iron concentration ( LIC ) , cardiac iron chelation adequacy pituitary gonadal reproductive hormone level ( spermatogenesis adult male patient ) , order well define association iron burden chelation pattern fertility potential , thalassemia patient iron overload . The study ass whether current chelation treatment regimen , particular pubertal developmental age , adequate preserving fertility could lead improved chelation routine prevent high prevalence compromise fertility . In addition , utilize state-of-the-art marker fertility status , finding study may improve current method screen hypogonadism reproductive potential allow earlier intervention . The investigator propose examine 26-30 patient , 12 year old , measure fertility potential , correlate current iron burden parameter cumulative iron effect indicate past iron overload pattern chelation history .</brief_summary>
