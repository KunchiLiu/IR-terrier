	<brief_title>The Back Exercises Neutralize Disability Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-blinded , comparison-control group , single-center study effect exercise without blood flow restriction apply appendicular limb safety , body composition ( i.e. , muscle mass ) , muscle strength , muscle endurance , whole body regional lean mass bone density , back pain disability male female subject age 18-50 year recurrent low back pain poor moderate trunk extensor muscle endurance . Up 50 subject ( 2 arm ) randomize 1:1 ratio receive 10-weeks resistance exercise training ( group 1 ) without blood flow restriction ( group 2 ) . Randomization stratify sex . This study screen period 21 day ( day -21 day -1 , screen baseline measure ) , 10-week exercise treatment period ( day 1 day 70 ) 36-week follow period last exercise session ( day 70 day 322 ) . The total duration study first exercise session approximately 46 week . Baseline measure muscle size ( via MRI ) , muscle strength , muscle endurance , whole body regional lean mass bone density ( via DEXA ) , measure back pain disability obtain day -21 -1 . Primary Endpoint : The primary endpoint percent change trunk extensor muscle cross-sectional area measure MRI week 10 ( study day 70 ) start exercise training . Secondary : The secondary endpoint include : - Muscle strength - Muscle endurance ( time task failure ) - Whole body regional lean mass DEXA - Whole body regional bone density DEXA - Pain - Disability - Safety - Treatment acceptability Procedures Assessments Efficacy measure ( MRI , muscle strength , muscle endurance , lean mass , bone density , pain , disability ) obtain screen week 10 ( day 70 ) week 20 ( day 154 ) . Safety blood flow restrict exercise assess base adverse event finding monitoring . Subjects ask monitor report adverse event ( AEs ) experience time informed consent sign end-of-study visit . Treatment acceptability determine administer Treatment Evaluation Inventory survey end fourth sixteenth exercise session .</detailed_description>
