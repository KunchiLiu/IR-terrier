	<brief_title>Myocardial Stress Perfusion Computed Tomography Evaluation Patients With Acute Chest Pain Using Novel 3rd Generation Dual-source CT System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator assess late generation CT scanner heart disease detection . On new machine investigator analyse ability machine show delivery blood heart muscle . Results compare result gold standard test myocardial perfusion imaging , image test show blood supply heart muscle . Further analysis record amount radiation , CT machine acquire image , compare amount radiation necessary produce image previous CT system . With new CT system reduction amount radiation dose compare previous system .</detailed_description>
