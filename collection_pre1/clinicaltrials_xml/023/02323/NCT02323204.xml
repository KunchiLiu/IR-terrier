With alpha 0.05 , sample size 134 parent-child dyad arm ( n=268 ) 100 % power examine comparison . The investigator oversample 12 % total n = 300 . Recruitment , Screening Randomization . The research team review patient admission record morning afternoon/evening identify eligible patient ( unintentional injury admission 10-17 year age ) .

The team member discus study complete consent process dyad in-person . To minimize possibility coercion consent process , research team follow consent document closely stress dyad child 's health care affect participation study . Randomization . After enrollment , family randomly assign rolling basis either Link trauma education arm study . Intervention Training . Parents randomize intervention arm train offer Link child need . A 20 45 minute training session offer ED in-patient ward private consultation room member research team .

If randomization achieve , investigator pursue Generalized Linear Mixed Models ( GLMM ) .
