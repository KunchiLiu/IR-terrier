	<brief_title>An fMRI Study Temporal Discounting Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among various psychological property decision make process temporal discounting , decrease subjective value good function amount delay reward . The ability decide immediate versus future reward depend self-control consideration future . We reconceptualize suicide intertemporal discounting interaction cognition mood . Someone contemplate suicide weighs time value cost benefit shift negative positive valence system . To best knowledge , one assess interaction mood symptom , anxiety , impact temporal discounting paradigm bipolar patient . If good understood difference anxious , suicidal non-anxious , suicidal bipolar patient , could design effective intervention prevent tragic outcome . We propose novel paradigm explore link bipolar disorder , anxiety , suicide . If conceptualize suicidal behavior death suicide decision , make sense examine key aspects decision making patient . In particular , examine mood , anxiety , suicidal ideation behavior arise patterns decision making , along neural correlate decision-making , assessed fMRI .</detailed_description>
