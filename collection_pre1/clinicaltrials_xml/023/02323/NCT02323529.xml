	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Once Daily Dosing Compared Twice Daily Dosing Nitisinone HT-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nitisinone ( Orfadin ) use treatment hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 ( HT-1 ) , inborn error metabolism . The clinical study form basis license nitisinone treatment HT-1 use twice daily dose . This become recommended dosing frequency nitisinone state Summary Product Characteristics . Later , half-life become know ( around 50 hour adult ) , many physician start use daily dosing . The suitability daily dose especially switch patient twice daily dose document . The aim study therefore investigate effect nitisinone serum concentration ( Cmax Cmin ) possible clinical consequence low dose frequency . This one-way crossover study consist three period ; Screening period , Treatment period 1 Treatment period 2 . The study start screen period ( Visit 1-1b ) may 6 week long . This follow two treatment period least 4 week . During Treatment period 1 ( Visits 2-3 ) , patient take Orfadin twice daily . During Treatment period 2 ( Visits 4-5 ) , patient take Orfadin daily . The dose nitisinone study one prescribed complete screening visit . Dose 1-2 mg/kg body weight . The total treatment period least 8 week . At least 20 patient minimum 3 patient follow age group include ; infant ( &lt; 2 year ) , child ( 2- &lt; 12 year ) , adolescent ( 12- &lt; 18 year ) adult ( â‰¥18 year ) . Determination succinylacetone ( SA ) blood ( serum/plasma ) and/or urine perform locally central Good Laboratory Practice certify laboratory ( Dry Blood Spot sample ) . The purpose local sample provide investigator less immediate result determine dose adjustment need patient enters either two treatment period . Results sample analyzed central laboratory , include determination nitisinone , use evaluation pharmacokinetics , efficacy safety two treatment period .</detailed_description>
