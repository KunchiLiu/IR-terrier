	<brief_summary>Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) show reduce heart failure ( HF ) , hospitalization death patient leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 35 % wide QRS . CRT provide electromechanical resynchronization improve LV systolic function . The induced LV reverse remodel near normalization LVEF â‰¥45 % associate significant reduction risk subsequent life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias ( VTA ) . And time replacement , need defibrillator back-up event-free first CRT-D service-life patient improve LVEF controversy question . 80 % Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator ( ICD ) patient implanted primary prevention experience VTA life-time first device . So , regard patient implant CRT-D primary prevention time first implantation , question experience VTA device replacement another CRT-D .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Ventricular Arrhythmia Risk After CRT-D Replacement Patients With Primary Prevention Indication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study describe , population patient primary prevention ICD indication first implantation CRT-D , relevance defibrillator back-up replacement first CRT-D. For , rate patient least one sustain VTA detect CRT-D conventional surface ECG assess device replacement . Furthermore , association baseline characteristic CRT-D population replacement risk subsequent VTA explore minimum two year FU .</detailed_description>
