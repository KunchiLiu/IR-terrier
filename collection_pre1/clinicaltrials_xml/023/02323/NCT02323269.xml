	<brief_summary>The primary objective study estimate annualized relapse rate ( ARR ) 12-month period patient Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis ( RRMS ) treat dimethyl fumarate ( DMF ) initial therapy ( treatment-naïve ) , switch interferon ( IFN ) glatiramer acetate ( GA ) ( suboptimal response define suboptimal efficacy , intolerance , poor adherence IFN GA ) , determine Prescribing Physician . The secondary objective study study population : To assess impact DMF 12 month period patient report outcomes ( PROs ) health economic related outcome ; evaluate additional clinical outcome Month 12 .</brief_summary>
