	<detailed_description>This Phase 4 multi-center , randomize open-label study 100 subject age ≥12 16 year experience decrease blood pressure procedure require general neuraxial anesthesia . At least 300 subject enrol study . It anticipate 33 % enrolled subject actually experience decrease blood pressure require treatment receive Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Injection ( PHI ) . There 12 possible randomization assignment : one six initial treatment PHI initially administer approximately 50 subject intravenous bolus ( IV-B ) Low ( 1 μg/kg ) , Med ( 3 μg/kg ) , High ( 5 μg/kg ) level ; PHI initially administer approximately 50 subject continuous intravenous infusion ( IV-I ) Low ( 0.25 μg/kg/min ) , Med ( 0.75 μg/kg/min ) , High ( 1.25 μg/kg/min ) level ] ; initial treatment group two pharmacokinetics ( PK ) sample schedule .</detailed_description>
