	<brief_title>Selinexor Treating Younger Patients With Recurrent Refractory Solid Tumors High-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) tablet formulation selinexor child recurrent/refractory solid central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor . II . To describe toxicity selinexor child recurrent/refractory solid CNS tumor . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics tablet formulation selinexor child recurrent/refractory solid CNS tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine antitumor effect selinexor preliminary manner child recurrent/refractory solid CNS tumor . II . To determine pharmacodynamic property selinexor child adolescent refractory solid tumor plasma protein whole blood ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) . III . To explore penetration , pharmacodynamic effect , biologic effect selinexor tumor tissue patient recurrent/refractory high-grade glioma ( HGG ) require resection . IV . To assess toxicity antitumor effect selinexor child recurrent/refractory HGG expand cohort follow dose-escalation measure rate objective radiographic response ( medical patient ) rate progression-free survival ( PFS ) six month start treatment ( surgical patient ) . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive selinexor orally ( PO ) twice weekly ( day 1 , 3 , 8 , 10 , 15 , 17 ) . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
