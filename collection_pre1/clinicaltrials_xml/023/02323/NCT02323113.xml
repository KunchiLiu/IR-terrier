	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability , Efficacy TAK-659 Adults With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-659 . TAK-659 test treat people relapse refractory acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) . This study conduct 2 phase . The first phase determine safe well-tolerated dose TAK-659 use second phase , second phase look response treatment people take TAK-659 . The study enroll approximately 81 patient ( 15 first phase 66 second phase ) . There two separate cohort Phase 2 portion study , one patient FLT-3 ITD mutation FLT-3 wild-type patient . Phase 1b : • TAK-659 60 mg tablet start dose escalate 20 mg high increment maximum tolerate dose recommended Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) Phase 2 : • TAK-659 tablet maximum tolerate dose RP2D determine Phase 1b . All participant ask take prescribed tablet time day throughout study . This multi-centre trial conduct United States Canada . The overall time participate study 24 month ( 12 month treatment 12 month follow ) unless treat physician believe participant would continue derive benefit study drug .</detailed_description>
