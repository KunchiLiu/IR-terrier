	<brief_summary>Background : Across European Union 535,000 Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) per year . Statistics indicate patient 60 year old approximately one 20 require corrective reoperations within 10 year surgery . However , patient young 60 year , approximately one 10 require revision total knee arthroplasty within 10 year surgery . As number younger patient increase , shift focus total Knee Replacement ( TKR ) outcome , post-operative function implant longevity important issue quality patient care . Furthermore , report 25 % patient satisfied functional result TKA . In vivo gold standard obtain reliable 3D measurement RSA . However often static , even advance x-ray film exchanger limit number picture take less 10 per second . Our dynamic RSA technique allow produce real time x-ray video TKA weight-bearing ( WB ) condition active muscle contraction . The purpose study investigate effect new implant design post-operative active knee kinematics , focus mid-flexion instability joint . A prospective randomized study perform new implant : DePuy ATTUNETM fixed-bearing ( FB ) posterior-stabilized ( PS ) knee prosthesis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main goal study investigate effect new implant design postoperative active knee kinematics mid-flexion instability joint . Data collect surgery Computer Assisted Surgery system post operative follow phase use dynamic RSA focusing . A prospective study perform new implant : DePuy ATTUNETM fixed-bearing ( FB ) posterior-stabilized ( PS ) knee prosthesis . Kinematic test perform analyze femoral rotation pattern translation pattern medial femoral condyle respect tibial plateau different daily life motor task . Despite reportedly good implant survival rate , patient fully satisfied total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . One debate topic TKA effectiveness prosthesis reproduce physiological kinematics replace knee , usually express term pattern joint rotation three anatomical plane , functional axis , tibio-femoral contact point medial lateral condyle , , femoral roll-back . Implant design influence final kinematic result . The mid-flexion instability may cause joint instability , paradoxical femoral rollback , surgical variation . Recently improve implant design fix bear PS DePuy implant anticipate early user . This implant claim reduce midflexion instability improve joint kinematics , particular multiradius shape condylar surface . For intra-operative kinematic acquisition , commercial navigation system ( BLUIGS , Orthokey Italia srl , Firenze , Italy ) dedicate software kinematic test use . In present study , investigator use postoperative bi-planar image method weight-bearing motor task active muscle contraction , determine vivo contact area tibial articulate surface PS TKA flexion knee . The objective present study determine contact area movement 0-140° arc motion anteroposterior ( AP ) ML direction . The cohort also compare data normal knee kinematics , report current literature . At 6 month follow-up , dynamic fluoroscopy use analyze implant kinematics ( i.e . stair descent , level-walking non weight-bearing maximum knee flexion ) simultaneous , real-time collection ground reaction force force platform perform . Clinical score collect time compare data register surgery follow routinely make 1 3 month surgery . A specifically developed device instal Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute use assess kinematic knee 6 month surgery . This equipment unique worldwide : specifically design , build certified dynamic static RSA evaluation TKA . The purpose study investigate effect new implant design post-operative active knee kinematics , focus mid-flexion instability joint . A prospective randomized study perform new implant : DePuy ATTUNETM fixed-bearing ( FB ) posterior-stabilized ( PS ) knee prosthesis .</detailed_description>
