	<brief_summary>Using randomized clinical trial 3 group , investigator conduct head-to-head evaluation two different theoretically-based intervention , SystemCHANGE CHANGE+ , compare Usual Care improve adoption maintenance exercise old cardiac patient . SystemCHANGE , novel intervention focus environmental change use System Improvement strategy increase exercise , compare CHANGE+ ( intervention base contemporary cognitive behavioral strategy ) . Study question : ( 1 ) Is difference SystemCHANGE , CHANGE+ Usual Care exercise adoption control covariates ( age , race , functional capacity , body fat , co-morbidity , muscle joint pain , exercise experience , home neighborhood environment , depression ) , individual follow cardiac rehabilitation program ( CRP ) ? ( 2 ) Is difference SystemCHANGE , CHANGE+ , Usual Care exercise maintenance control covariates ? ( 3 ) Do system change , social support exercise , problem-solving skill , motivation , health belief , exercise self-efficacy mediate effect SystemCHANGE , CHANGE+ , Usual Care exercise adoption ? ( 4 ) Do system change , social support exercise , problem-solving skill , motivation , health belief , exercise self-efficacy mediate effect SystemCHANGE , CHANGE+ CHANGE+ intervention term health care spending , labor force participation earnings , household productivity ? Older person ( N=420 ) recover cardiac event randomly assign three group . Measures exercise adoption maintenance ( # metabolic equivalent { METS } expend , whether subject remain exercise ) take 1 year completion CRP use heart rate wristwatch monitor , exercise diary , 7-Day Recall Survey . The effect covariates also assess . Mechanisms intervention achieve effect determine . Multivariate analyse examine compare effect intervention time . A cost-effectiveness analysis also conduct .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Assisting individual adopt maintain lifestyle exercise cardiac event remain challenge . The purpose 3-group , randomize control trial test two theoretically distinct behavior change intervention usual care ( UC ) group increase lifestyle exercise cardiac event . In new intervention , SystemCHANGE ( SC ) , base process improvement ecological theory , participant teach use series small self-designed experiment change daily routine associate exercise . The emphasis change system live rather rely motivation memory . The second intervention , CHANGE+ ( C+ ) , base cognitive behavioral theory , include contemporary approach increase self-efficacy , motivation , problem-solving skill . Sample The sample consist convenience sample 379 individual consecutively recruit five Phase II cardiac rehabilitation program ( CRP ) great Cleveland , Ohio area . Forty percent participant approach agreed participate randomize . Of 406 subject consent , 379 complete study . Subjects randomly assign one three study arm : SystemCHANGE ( process improvement model program health behavior change ) , CHANGE+ ( cognitive behavioral model program health behavior change ) , Usual Care . All subject recent cardiac event ( myocardial infarction , coronary artery bypass surgery and/or percutaneous coronary intervention ) participate Phase II cardiac rehabilitation program . Subjects recruit near end program follow one year cardiac rehabilitation . Subjects include great 55 year age able read speak English ; exclude met criterion high risk safe exercise participation follow cardiac event ( ejection fraction &lt; 30 % , decrease systolic blood pressure &gt; 15 mmHg exercise , serious arrhythmia rest exercise induce , exercise induce ischemia indicate angina &gt; 2 mm ST segment depression electrocardiogram ) . Intervention Protocols Both CHANGE+ SystemCHANGE intervention consist series five small-group ( six eight people ) education session provide three 1.5-hour session week last three week CRP two session hold one two month follow completion CRP . An experienced cardiac nurse exercise physiologist train intervention protocol taught session . In series structure activity , participant teach use behavior change strategy consistent respective intervention model . A series three monthly booster call make month four , five six follow last intervention class individual coach use strategy consistent respective intervention . Usual Care consist routine care provide CRP . All participant receive usual CRP prescribe structured exercise individual group class ( four ) diet modification stress reduction part routine care CRPs . At end CRP , individual give exercise prescription include target heart rate counsel exercise least five time week 30 minute . Measures Three dimension exercise measure : frequency , amount , maintenance . Exercise frequency number session exercise ( least 10 minute duration ) give period time . Exercise amount number hour exercise reflected frequency duration exercise session . Exercise measure use portable wristwatch heart rate monitor ( Polar RS400 ) exercise diary . Data monitor use primary data source diary data use backup data monitor available ( i.e. , forget put monitor , monitor malfunction ) . The heart rate ( HR ) monitor memory program record HR 5-second interval exercise session . Standardized , validate measure also obtain baseline , two , six , twelve month : system change , social support exercise , problem-solving skill , motivation , health belief , exercise self-efficacy . Measures also obtain possible moderate confound variable : age , race , functional capacity , body fat , co-morbidity , muscle joint pain , exercise experience , home neighborhood environment , depression . Procedures Individuals meet study inclusion criterion enrol sixth eighth week CRP write informed consent obtain . Baseline measure obtain private interview CRP center . The intervention begin week ten subject ' CRP . At end CRP , subject give HR monitor exercise diary direct return mail next twelve month . The number hour exercise exercise adoption ( month one three ) maintenance ( month four twelve ) calculate . Multiple linear regression use determine study group membership predict exercise adoption maintenance . Mediation analysis also conduct .</detailed_description>
