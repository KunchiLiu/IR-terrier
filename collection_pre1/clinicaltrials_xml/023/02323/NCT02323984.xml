	<brief_summary>Identification specific circulate microRNAs microemboli formation ( diagnosed TC Doppler ) delirious group nondelirious group primary target . Delirium assessment standardize questionnaire do baseline ( day surgery - pre operatory ) , immediately surgery ( post anesthesia care unit ) every 12 hour Day 1 Day2 surgery . The investigator use linear mixed model describe change pattern overtime , compare difference time point . Inflammatory biomarkers explore overtime well . The investigator also explore age effect cognitive function - cognitive reserve - base score cognitive test administer baseline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific circulate microRNA 's identified patient neurological disease deficit , specifically neurodegenerative condition . Furthermore , available evidence primarily pre-clinical / animal model support hypothesis post-surgical/anesthesia - induced neuroinflammation lead post-operative cognitive decline dysfunction . The investigator hypothesize specific circulate microRNA 's involved pro-inflammatory response surgery/anesthesia suitable biomarker Delirium and/or POCD surgical hip-arthroplasty patient . However , also possible microamboli surgical procedure could contribute neurologic outcome . Therefore , addition analyze microRNA level ( primary target ) , investigator propose monitor cerebral vascular flow surgery possibly identify microambolic event use Transcranial Doppler . Overall , overarch goal identify novel early clinical indicator cognitive dysfunction ( e.g . Delirium POCD ) . The study include preoperative-postoperative trajectory well value use subject self-controls appropriate longitudinal analysis cognition . There many factor potential confounders relation cognitive decline incident dementia . There key characteristic event : - illness require hospitalization , could potentially accelerate cognitive decline worsen clinical dementia rating - anesthetic agent administer surgical procedure - intra-operative adverse event ( anesthesia/surgery relate , cerebral hypoxia , hypotension/hypertension , blood loss ) - patient factor ( age , education , comorbidity ) - physiologic factor ( inflammation , micro-embolization , blood-brain barrier function ) ; - perioperative factor ( medication , sleep , complication ) - postoperative factor ( rehabilitation , depression , social support )</detailed_description>
