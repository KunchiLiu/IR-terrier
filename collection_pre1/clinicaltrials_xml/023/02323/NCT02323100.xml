	<brief_title>Glycerol Phenylbutyrate Corrector Therapy For CF ( Cystic Fibrosis )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We first test 4-phenylbutyrate ( Buphenyl ) systemic corrector defect F508del investigator-initiated Investigational New Drug ( IND ) application hold P. Zeitlin . In series Phase 1 2 trial establish maximum tolerate dose 20 gm daily divide t.i.d . maximum induction cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) -mediated nasal epithelial chloride transport 30 gm daily median -10 millivolt ( mV ) day 4 7 treatment.1 ; 2 Under condition significant decrease sweat chloride value amiloride-inhibited nasal potential difference ( NPD ) . We interpret result proof concept corrector therapy , corrector therapy alone likely insufficient therapy mutation CF , therefore close IND 4-phenylbutyrate . In ensue year , Vertex Pharmaceuticals , Inc. success development ivacaftor3 ; 3 ; 4 ( VX-770 ) potentiator G551D CFTR study drug alone combination corrector lumacaftor5 ( VX-809 ) VX-661 . We Johns Hopkins University ( JHU ) , University Alabama Birmingham ( UAB ) Childrens ' Hospital Philadelphia/University Pennsylvania ( CHOP/Penn ) participate many clinical trial please encouraged success VX-770 . It yet certain future combination corrector ( ) potentiator ( ) safe effective , prudent explore alternative correctors potentiators . Furthermore , recent structural investigation number laboratory support idea one corrector may necessary fully restore F508del traffic pathway 6 . Precedent combination 4PBA CFTR modulators establish vitro 7 ; 8 4-Phenylbutyrate tablet formulate oral delivery , show pharmacokinetics similar CF patient urea cycle disorder . However large number tablet ingest meal somewhat daunt 30 gm daily dose . A new pro-drug 4-phenylbutyrate , glycerol phenylbutyrate Ravicti® ( own Hyperion Pharmaceuticals , Inc. ) approve February 2013 US FDA . This new formulation significant advance patient urea cycle disorder oral , odorless , tasteless liquid , contain 3 molecule 4-phenylbutyrate every molecule triglyceride . Simple arithmetic would suggest one mole equivalent pro-drug provide three mole active drug . However , pancreatic lipase enzymes required break covalent bond release active drug intestine . Because CF patient homozygous F508del pancreatic-insufficient already enzyme therapy , propose test effectiveness combination CF pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy ( PERT ) absorption Ravicti® subsequent restoration nasal epithelial CFTR-mediated chloride transport nasal potential difference ( NPD ) test .</detailed_description>
