The standard treatment DSSD medical , either pharmacological clean intermittent self-catheterisation ( CISC ) . Some patient unable perform CISC require alternative surgical technique external sphincterotomy invasive , irreversible adjustment period patient . Urethral stent develop alternative surgical sphincterotomy . Temporary stent provide non-definitive treatment , especially evolutionary pathology , patient refuse destructive surgery ( psychosocial impact ) , patient define yet therapeutic preference .
