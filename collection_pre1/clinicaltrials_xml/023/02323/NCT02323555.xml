	<brief_summary>A prescription injectable anticancer therapy require collection medical data ( interview physical examination ) often ally ( laboratory test ) . This requirement make day arrival patient prepare treatment incorrectly . After receive prescription treatment , take 1 hour prepare pharmacy time high activity , provide day hospital pocket treatment , incompressible time patient wait treatment . A process select ( Optima ) anticipate prescribe injectable cancer treatment manufacture reduce patient wait time day come François BaclesseCentre day hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Given investigator daily activity evaluate patient receive 65-70 day hospital , assess feasibility project internalize platform seem relevant completely control process cost . This project consist anticipation paramedic telephone consultation follow medical prescription validation trigger production chemotherapy prematurely come patient . The François Baclesse Center therefore support idea early day hospital , say prescription production pocket chemotherapy arrival patient service . This project name PROJECT OPTIMA `` Optimize requirement preparation chemotherapy Ambulatory Medicine '' paramedic telephone consultation . So ambitious project first experience French advance routine injectable anticancer therapy , protocol combine Centre Fight Cancer also hospital reference competent oncology chemotherapy whose preparation process chemotherapy administer injection fully internalize centralize . Before start program routine , essential validate research project concordance paramedic telephone consultation structure use tool medical consultation also define profile patient type chemotherapy injectable likely benefit safely program . This study conduct two part : • Part 1 : compare two tool : - paramedical examination conduct telephone two day arrival patient train nurse , accord predetermine grid , basis medical decision prescription `` virtual '' non-treatment ; - medical examination perform day come patient treatment . This component run three month evaluate rate discrepancy 2 type prescription . During period , prescription administration treatment validate end paramedical examination phone . This component also detect specify protocol suitable injectable cancer treatment develop typology patient anticipation process efficient secure . Indeed , investigator think anticipation process effective patient . For example , patient brain tumor often diminish cognitive ability include memory ability . Responses telephone interview conduct nurse may incomplete even false due memory disorder . At time , wait time patient satisfaction evaluate used reference second part study whose objective evaluate benefit early prescription use routinely . • 2nd part : It assessment process routinely use define profile patient type treatment protocol , include phone call nurse , early prescription chemotherapy , early production day , medical consultation control administration . In step compare expectation time , patient satisfaction treatment wrongly prepared launch Optima . Prerequisites : - All nurse conduct telephone interview train two day conduct EFEC ( European School Oncology Training ) whose purpose explain issue telephone interview result prescription chemotherapy patient . - Nurses phone platform dedicate call patient experience service , allow develop acuity identify clue signpost important piece information management patient . Feasibility : This study conduct two stage period three month , allow investigator activity include 450 patient step , base 3 patient come , 1350 come step .. The homepage day hospital service capacity 40 place activity 65-70 patient per day . Approximately 300 patient admit week 42 new patient week . The investigator welcome specialty outside Hematology ( digestive oncology , ENT Pneumology , urogynecologic , breast screening , brain tumor sarcomas ) .</detailed_description>
