	<brief_summary>Accumulating evidence suggest repeatedly breathe low oxygen level brief period ( termed intermittent hypoxia ) safe effective treatment strategy promote meaningful functional recovery person chronic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) .

	<detailed_description>Accumulating evidence suggest repeatedly breathe low oxygen level brief period ( termed intermittent hypoxia ) safe effective treatment strategy promote meaningful functional recovery person chronic spinal cord injury . Repetitive exposure mild hypoxia trigger cascade event spinal cord , include new protein synthesis increase sensitivity circuitry necessary breathing walking . Recently , investigator demonstrate daily ( 5 consecutive day ) intermittent hypoxia stimulate walk enhancement person chronic spinal cord injury . Despite exciting finding , important question remain . First , intermittent hypoxia improve walk recovery increase strength muscle coordination ? Understanding mechanism allow u best apply intermittent hypoxia clinic . Second , initial study indicate beneficial effect intermittent hypoxia great intermittent hypoxia use prior task train benefit great practice task . The investigator explore possibility examine effect intermittent hypoxia walk ability force production apply alone apply combination walk train strength training . The investigator expect great improvement walk ability intermittent hypoxia walk train great improvement strength response intermittent hypoxia strength training . Third , study suggest intermittent hypoxia induces spinal plasticity increase expression key plasticity-promoting protein , brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) . Mutations BDNF gene show impair BDNF functionality . Thus , investigator also explore impact BDNF polymorphism responsiveness intermittent hypoxia therapy .</detailed_description>
