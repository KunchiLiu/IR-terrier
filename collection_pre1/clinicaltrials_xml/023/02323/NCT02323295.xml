	<brief_summary>This study design characterize effect high energy radiation bone breakdown , specific interest reduce rate sacral fracture . Although radiation important managing tumor , related complication bone fracture . In research study , investigator look determine change blood marker , bone density , bone structure follow radiation well understand reason change .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All laboratory test part eligibility criterion must complete within 14 day prior date registration . Diagnostic test part eligibility criterion must perform within 30 day date registration . Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Study participant must histologically confirm primary malignant bone tumor sacrum surgery radiation radiation alone plan . Age 18 year old . In child age 8 , tetracycline derivative report stain tooth enamel yellow color . These consideration lead u exclude young person age 18 study . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit Aspartaataminotransferase ( AST ) ( SGOT ) / Alanineaminotransferase ( ALT ) ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subject creatinine level institutional normal limit The effect tetracycline radiation use computer tomography develop human fetus know detrimental . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately .
