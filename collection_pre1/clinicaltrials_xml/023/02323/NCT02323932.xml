	<brief_title>Perception Intonation Bimodal Bilateral Cochlear Implant Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bilateral hearing fundamental characteristic normal auditory system provide significant advantage adverse listen condition . In cochlear implant user , binaural hearing achieve via bilateral cochlear implant ( CI/CI ) binaural-bimodal stimulation , i.e . cochlear implant one ear hearing aid ( CI/HA ) . It assume CI/CI hear CI/HA hear differ respect physiological source functional benefit . Although hear prosthesis ( CI/CI CI/HA ) lack several feature need allow listener experience full binaural advantage confer normal-hearing auditory system , however , provide significant advantage use unilateral hearing prosthesis . Most accepted assessment clinical material sensitive enough evaluate contribution binaural hearing rehabilitation via CI/CI CI/HA hear perception intonation . In previous study perception intonation evaluate 29 adult CI/HA user via closed-set format design target talker . The result study show small bimodal benefit . The test paradigm apparently easy task adult listener sensitive enough show expect CI/HA bimodal benefit cochlear implant alone . The perception correct intonation identification compute listener listening condition . The amount change fundamental frequency require order identify question compute listener condition . ANOVA repeat measure use assess difference among condition group well differences among group .</detailed_description>
