	<brief_summary>The imdazoline2 bind site ( I2BS ) know reside inside astrocyte . Changes number I2BS post mortem tissue implicate range psychiatric condition depression addiction , along neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer 's disease Huntington 's chorea . Preclinical study also demonstrate functional interaction opioid system , I2BS ligands show affect tolerance morphine alleviate morphine withdrawal syndrome rat . Recently I2BS I2BS ligands show interesting analgesic effect different model pain novel I2BS ligand , CR4056 , currently undergo Phase II clinical trial novel treatment neuropathic pain acute non- specific pain state . The location I2BS astrocytic glial cell possibility may way regulate glial fibrillary acidic protein lead increased interest role I2BS I2BS ligands condition characterise marked gliosis . The number I2BS show increase Alzheimer 's disease post mortem , also suggest I2BS may marker severity malignancy human glioblastoma . The lack suitable imaging tool I2BS meant information regard number distribution I2BS brain come preclinical specie vitro post-mortem study . The recent development [ 11C ] BU99008 suitable PET ligand quantify I2BS vivo , enable direct quantification I2BS availability regional distribution live human brain . In study investigator plan utilise [ 11C ] BU99008 quantify regional brain availability I2BS human brain vivo use PET .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study consist three part ; Part A , B C. Part A involve 10 healthy subject order determine number regional location I2BS healthy human brain follow administration [ 11C ] BU99008 . In Part B 6 healthy subject recruit provide sufficient PET data quantify intra- inter-subject variability regional expression I2BS healthy human brain . Finally , Part C 6 healthy subject recruit order determine distribution I2BS whole body follow administration [ 11C ] BU99008 . The three part study conducted series , part successful investigator progress next . This allow u terminate study early , hence prevent un-necessary exposure participant ionise radiation , emerge data show clear No-go decision progress PET ligand . Potential participant pass initial telephone screen invite screen visit eligibility take part study determine informed consent take . This Imperial CRF Imanova Ltd . The screening consist interview study discuss explain . The participants'understanding procedure , requirement commitment confirm question answer informed consent take . In addition interview participant personal detail demographic record psychiatric medical history take well follow : - Semi-structured interviews/questionnaires complete : Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5 ( MINI 5 ) , Cognitive diagnostic test dementia ( CAMCOG ) - A medical examination blood take clinical laboratory test . - A structural MRI . - Review medical history current state health , include question psychiatric symptom use prescription non-prescription drug , well use illegal drug alcohol . - Physical examination measurement blood pressure heart rate , ECG . - Collecting urine sample check presence drug . - Alcohol breath test . - An `` Allen 's Test '' perform check blood supply hand . - Other questionnaire : Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) , Eysenck personality ( revise ) ( EPQ-R25 ) , Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) , MRI safety Participants eligible invited take part study , either Parts A , B C detail . Below intended schedule scanning study . However , reason necessary cancel suspend scan due radioligand production failure , scanner failure , etc. , participant ask return another day . This happen radioligand administer time study suspend . As detailed cannulae introduce collect blood various analysis study day ( approximately 120 mL ) . The blood collect one participant exceed 500 mL entire study . Part A This study healthy volunteer , involve 10 healthy human subject , subject require receive three PET scan two study day : - Scanning Day 1 ; Morning - baseline scan [ 11C ] BU99008 alone determine total number binding site ( total , PET signal ) . - Scanning Day 1 ; Afternoon - block scan [ 11C ] BU99008 combination single dose idazoxan ( I2BS block ) â€¢ Scanning Day 2 ; All day - block scan [ 11C ] BU99008 combination single dose isocarboxazid ( MAO block ) The combination three scan allow u dissect regional contribution I2BS MAO component [ 11C ] BU99008 specific signal , order get accurate determination number I2BS different brain region . The investigator confident component [ 11C ] BU99008 signal due MAO negligible . If confirm second scanning day discontinue . This adaptive approach allow u minimise unnecessary exposure participant ionise radiation study medication . Scanning day 1 - The participant arrive Imanova 's scan facility Burlington Danes Building , Hammersmith Hospital early morning . The exact time determine logistical constraint two production [ 11C ] BU99008 . On arrival , participant ask agree carry participate study general health compliance study specific restriction assess interview , urine drug abuse screen breathalyser . Once confirm eligible proceed , undergo various procedure day . The participant cannulate radial artery venous cannula insert forearm cubital vein . The arterial cannula require arterial blood sample throughout scan . A venous cannula require administration [ 11C ] BU99008 . If on-going analysis indicate arterial blood sample require analysis [ 11C ] BU99008 , sample take future subject participate study cannula implant . Baseline subjective objective measure take prepared position scanner PET scan 1 . The scan approximately 120 min length , time heart rate blood pressure monitor . At end scan , participant remove another set subjective objective measure take . They give acute dose idazoxan ( 80 mg ; p.o . ) 120 min start PET scan 2 another round subjective objective measure arterial blood sample take PET scan 1 . At end PET scan 2 , participant remove scanner , indwell cannulae remove , final round subjective objective measure record , fitness send home assess attend physician . When fit leave send home taxi . Scanning day 2 - The day similar scan day 1 one scan ( PET scan 3 ) . Participants arrive Imanova 's scan facility Burlington Danes Building , Hammersmith Hospital . Unlike scan day 1 time arrival flexible , exact arrival time determine synthesis [ 11C ] BU99008 convenient time participant . On arrival , participant ask agree carry participate study general health compliance study specific restriction assess interview , urine drug abuse screen breathalyser . Once confirm eligible proceed participant cannulate ( require ) . Baseline subjective objective measure take administer acute dose isocarboxazid ( 50 mg ; p.o . ) 240 min start PET scan 3 . A round subjective objective measure record prepared position scanner PET scan 3 ( ) . At end scan participant remove scanner , indwell cannulae remove , final round subjective objective measure record , fitness send home assess attend physician . When fit leave send home taxi . Part B This part study understand intra- inter-subject variability I2BS regional density differs healthy population . To assess , 6 healthy volunteer receive two scan [ 11C ] BU99008 alone , two separate study day : - Scanning Day 1 - scan [ 11C ] BU99008 alone - Scanning Day 2 - scan [ 11C ] BU99008 alone The combination two scan enable u determine intra- inter-subject variability expression I2BS normal population . On arrival , participant ask agree carry participate study . In addition , general health compliance participant study specific restriction assess interview , urine drug abuse screen breathalyser . The participant cannulate described ( require ) . Baseline subjective objective measure take prior preparation position scanner PET scan . The scan approximately 120 min length heart rate blood pressure monitor . In addition , Part A , arterial and/or venous blood sample take throughout scan . At end scan participant remove scanner , indwell cannulae remove final round subjective objective measure record . At point fitness participant send home assess attend physician . When fit leave send home taxi . Part C This part study determine whole body bio-distribution I2BS healthy human . Up 6 healthy subject enrol part study determine number distribution I2BS variety tissue organ . Each participant receive one whole body PET scan [ 11C ] BU99008 . This whole body scan enable u determine I2BS distribute tissue organ addition brain . Participants part study receive one PET scan single study visit . On arrival participant ask agree carry participate study . In addition , general health compliance participant study specific restriction assess interview , urine drug abuse screen breathalyser . The participant cannulate . Baseline subjective objective measure take prior preparation position scanner PET scan . The scan probably 240 min length ( two , 2hr session break in-between ) heart rate blood pressure monitor . In addition , Parts A B , arterial blood sample take throughout scan . Unlike PET scan Parts A &amp; B scan occur whole body scan brain . At end scan participant remove scanner , indwell cannulae remove final round subjective objective measure record . At point fitness send home assess attend physician . When fit leave send home taxi .</detailed_description>
