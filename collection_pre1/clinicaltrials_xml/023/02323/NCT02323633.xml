	<brief_summary>Children ADHD display certain brainwave profile might different child ADHD . Treatment tPCS ( transcranial pulse current stimulation ) show brainwave profile could possibly alter closely resemble brainwave profile child ADHD . Researchers believe change brainwave profile might lessen symptom ADHD . tPCS name use describe type current device produce . It involve randomly ( specific pattern ) produce pulse current different time brain pick . These pulse low current stimulate brain certain way affect brainwave activity . Treatment give apply low frequency current use small electrode clip earlobes . The current come external battery source . The pulse current generated device stimulate certain part brain result possible increase control attention behaviour . This treatment already proven safe hurt child . Due specific part brain stimulate , positive result previous research , seem possible control certain function child suffer inattention hyperactivity . The idea use tPCS stimulation possible way help child confirm ADHD open new window future research . The final goal device research offer safe , non-invasive ( conservative treatment require pierce body removal tissue ) treatment use long-term basis show clear improvement ADHD symptoms child even adult ADHD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase IIa Exploratory Clinical Trial , Examine Safety Efficacy tPCS Paediatric ADHD Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Inspection Records : Investigators institution involve trial permit trial-related monitoring , audit , Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) review , regulatory inspection ( ) provide direct access trial record . In event audit , investigator agrees allow sponsor , representative sponsor applicable regulatory authority access trial record . The confidentiality record identify participant protect , respect privacy confidentiality rule accordance regulatory requirement . The investigator must promptly notify sponsor audit schedule regulatory authority promptly forward copy audit report receive sponsor . In order ensure data accuracy , data individual participant visit must complete soon possible/ during/ immediately follow visit . All complete data review , sign , date investigator timely manner . - Database Management Quality Control : Data management , include development management database , perform accordance regulatory requirement . The designate data management vendor review CRF data completeness accuracy . A formal querying process follow whereby data management group request site personnel clarify apparent erroneous entry inconsistencies request additional information site require . Medical history/current medical condition adverse event cod use Medical dictionary regulatory activity ( MedDRA ) terminology . - Sample Size : As research exploratory nature sample size calculate base assumption current data compare pediatrics , tPCS , ADHD . Since preliminary data available clinically relevant improvement regard 15 % shift total range two ADHD sub-scales ( Inattention Hyperactivity/Impulsivity ) , 9 item , i.e . 4.05 ( =0.15 x 27 item score 0 3 Likert scale ) . The standard deviation estimate range/6 = 27/6 = 4.5 , i.e . total range Gaussian distribution 6 standard deviation . A sample ratio 2:1 use . A sample size 48 child ( 32:16 ) 80 % power detect difference 4.05 point group test two-sided use Students t-test 0.05 level significance . Continuous data summarise use descriptive statistic . Categorical data present use N % ( use number participant without miss data calculation ) . 95 % confidence interval determine data , applicable . No imputation miss value perform calculation summary statistic . - Safety Data Analysis : The safety analyse perform safety population . All safety parameter ( adverse event , physical examination finding , vital sign , physical measurement qEEG finding ) summarise descriptively treatment group . The descriptive statistic include number observation , mean , standard deviation , median , minimum maximum continuous variable number observation percentages categorical variable . Changes baseline well shift table provide safety laboratory parameter ( within , normal range ) . The analysis adverse event include treatment emergent adverse event . Adverse event cod use MedDRA present system organ class preferred term treatment group . - Efficacy Data 1 . Primary Efficacy analysis : The mean change Inattention Hyperactivity-Impulsive subscales SNAP-IV-C rating scale well Conners ' 3 Parent rating scale baseline Day 42 calculate group . Mean change baseline trial time point ( Days 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 ) also calculate . The statistical analysis method consist pair t-tests within group analysis Co-variance ( ANCOVA ) group change assessment time . The paired t-tests compare change variable tPCS administration tPCS within group ( active sham condition ) . A one-way ANCOVA , factor group ( active sham ) co-variance baseline value , employ compare group respect change baseline estimate outcomes , e.g . change complete score baseline 6-weeks inattentive hyperactivity-impulsivity SNAP-IV-C Conners ' 3 Parent rating scale . Groups also compare time ( Days 0 , 14 , 28 42 ) use linear mixed model analysis particular interest interaction group time . 2 . Secondary Efficacy analysis : The mean change psychometric test-battery baseline Day 42 calculate group . Mean change baseline trial time point ( Days 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 ) also calculate . The statistical analysis method consist pair t-tests within group analysis Co-variance ( ANCOVA ) group change assessment time . The paired t-tests compare change variable tPCS administration tPCS within group ( active sham condition ) . A one-way ANCOVA , factor group ( active sham ) co-variance baseline value , employ compare group respect change baseline estimate outcomes , e.g . change complete score baseline 6-weeks psychometric test-battery . Groups also compare time ( Days 0 , 14 , 28 42 ) use linear mixed model analysis repeat measure particular interest interaction group time . EEG analysis Power spectrum determine epoch data frequency-domain analysis . Mean median power frequency calculate within 4 EEG frequency band ( intraband ) entire EEG range ( interband ) . Also , band power fraction relative amount power within EEG band respect total amount spectrum power determine . The coherence analysis complete use two band ( alpha theta ) four sub-bands ( low-alpha ( 8-10 Hz ) , high-alpha ( 10-12 Hz ) , low-beta ( 12-20 Hz ) , high-beta ( 20-30 Hz ) ) . We use Welch 's average modify periodogram method find estimate coherence signal x , represent electrode site . It function power spectral density x cross power spectral density . Groups also compare time ( Days 0 , 42 84 ) use linear mixed model analysis repeat measure particular interest interaction group time .</detailed_description>
