	<detailed_description>Pre-defined research question / hypothesis endpoint : Main objective endpoint : To evaluate effect Amoxicillin versus placebo disease-specific disability evaluate Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire ( RMDQ ) one year ( 12 month ) follow-up patient chronic LBP MCs type I II adjacent previously herniated disc ( Hypothesis A ) . Thus , project Main objective re-examine clinical effect antibiotic treatment report former Danish study one year ( 12 month ) follow-up . Investigators use primary outcome measure ( RMDQ ) , effect evaluate patient MCs type I MCs type II since , outline , investigator argue MCs type I patient may classify MCs type II patient vice versa dependent magnet strength MRI machine use , MCs type I type II likely represent common process ( influenced common treatment ) ( hypothesis A ) . As secondary objective ( SO 1 ) investigator evaluate effect Amoxicillin versus placebo RMDQ one year ( 12 month ) follow-up separately patient type I type II MCs , respectively ( hypothesis B C ) . Exploratory key supportive objective ( KSOs ) endpoint ) : - KSO 2 . To evaluate effect Amoxicillin versus placebo Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) one year ( 12 month ) follow-up whole cohort include patient ( hypothesis D ) . - KSO 3 . To evaluate effect Amoxicillin versus placebo LBP intensity one year ( 12 month ) follow-up whole cohort include patient ( hypothesis E ) . - KSO 4 . To evaluate whether short tau inversion recovery ( STIR ) signal ( intensity extent ) MCs baseline MRI predict change RMDQ baseline one year ( 12 month ) follow-up ( hypothesis F ) . - KSO 5 . To assess whether change STIR signal ( intensity extent ) MCs one year ( 12 month ) follow-up related change RMDQ baseline one year ( 12 month ) follow-up ( hypothesis G ) . - KSO 6 . To evaluate effect Amoxicillin versus placebo health-related quality life ( EQ-5D ) one year ( 12 month ) follow-up whole cohort include patient ( hypothesis H ) . - To evaluate cost-effectiveness Amoxicillin versus placebo one year ( 12 month ) follow-up whole cohort include patient . - To evaluate whether positive pain provocation test baseline predicts change RMDQ one year ( 12 month ) follow-up . - To evaluate difference incidence AEs SAEs two intervention group inclusion one year ( 12 month ) follow-up whole cohort include patient . - To evaluate , separately two intervention group , whether lack clinically important improvement RMDQ , ODI , LBP intensity , respectively , baseline post-treatment ( 100-das start treatment ) associate lack clinically important improvement outcome baseline one-year ( 12 month ) follow-up . - Further clinical objective endpoint : To evaluate effect Amoxicillin versus placebo : - RMDQ one year ( 12 month ) follow-up separately patient previously undergo back surgery disc herniation patient NOT previously undergo back surgery disc herniation . - outcome measure mention ( leg pain intensity , hour LBP last 4 week , bothersomeness , day sick leave , co-interventions , patient ' satisfaction , global perceive effect ) one year ( 12 month ) follow-up whole cohort include patient - secondary outcome measure one year ( 12 month ) follow-up separately patient type I type II MCs baseline , respectively - primary secondary outcome measure posttreatment ( 100 day start treatment ) whole cohort separately patient type I type II MCs baseline , respectively . - Further radiological objective endpoint : To assess whether characteristic MCs baseline MRI predict change ODI , change intensity LBP baseline one year ( 12 month ) follow-up . To compare change characteristic MCs inclusion one year ( 12 month ) follow-up treatment group , ass whether change MCs related change RMDQ , ODI , pain intensity baseline one year ( 12 month ) follow-up . To determine reliability different MCs characteristic different MRI method . To assess relationship MC characteristic clinical variable . Genetic objective endpoint : To investigate effect Amoxicillin epigenetic pattern , longitudinal gene- protein expression , genetic variation , baseline post-treatment ( 100 day start treatment ) baseline one year ( 12 month ) follow-up patient MCs type I II , evaluate correlation clinical data . Randomization list create use STATA 13 ( StatCorp LP , College Station , TX , USA ) stratify MODIC type ( 1/2 ) previous surgery ( yes/no ) 1:1:1:1 allocation random block size 4 6 . This ensure similar number patient receive antibiotic placebo within stratum ( 1-MCs type I , previous back surgery disc herniation , 2-MCs type I , previous back surgery disc herniation , 3-MCs type II , previous back surgery disc herniation , 4-MCs type II , previous back surgery disc herniation ) . Investigators intend recruit two equally large patient group , one type I MCs one type II MCs , order evaluate treatment effect separately MC type group total sample . Investigators achieve stratify randomization explain , investigator stop inclusion two MCs type II stratum ( without previous surgery ) investigator enough MCs type II patient , continue inclusion two MCs type I strata ( vice versa ) . Patients stratify previous back surgery disc herniation ( Yes/No ) since clear low virulent anaerobic organisms gain access disc ( normal bacteraemia result intraoperative contamination ) . Hence , stratify previous back surgery disc herniation ensure balance distribution potential source infection group . Investigators design study enough power evaluate treatment effect separately MC type I group MC type II group ( investigator include equally many Modic I Modic II patient trial ) , main analysis whole cohort patient MCs type I II . In power calculation MC type group , investigator use two-sided alfa 0.05 power 0.90 wish able identify difference mean RMDQ 4 ( SD 5 ) two treatment group 12 month follow-up . The minimal important difference mean RMDQ group clear , change RMDQ 2-3 individual patient time unlikely important may represent measurement error . Investigators therefore use difference 4 mean RMDQ group power calculation . The SD 5 within upper range commonly report SDs RMDQ patient persistent LBP . A to-sided alfa 0.05 ( i.e . 95 % Confidence Interval ) , power 90 , ratio sample size 1 ( antibiotic group / placebo group ) difference RMDQ 4 ( SD 5 ) result sample size 33 treatment group , 66 treatment group ; i.e . 132 total sample ( MC type group ) . The Danish RCT Albert et al 2013 11 % dropout . Adding 20 % dropout ( 26 patient ) investigator calculate need include 158 patient study , round 160 patient : 80 patient type I MCs 80 patient type II MCs . Data main outcome analyse statistician blind group status . The primary analysis ( main outcome ) intention-to-treat whole cohort patient MCs type I II use ANCOVA analysis adjust baseline RMDQ-score . The significance level 0.05 . Investigators report p value 95 % CI . ANCOVA analysis , adjust baseline RMDQ-score , also use examine main outcome separately sub-samples type I II MSc . The significance level still 0.05 . Investigators report exact p value 95 % CI two sub-samples . For secondary outcome measure also ANCOVA analysis use adjustment baseline value accordance intention treat ( ITT ) . The analysis carry whole cohort patient MCs type I II significance level 0.05 , separately two sub-samples type I II MSc . Investigators report p value 95 % CI . Analyses MRI result include observer agreement analysis ( kappa , McNemars test , Bland Altmann plot ) multiple regression analyse assess relationship clinical variable . As secondary analysis , investigator perform responder analysis RMDQ supplement interpretability main analysis . They analyze high proportion patient MCs type I II baseline report clinically relevant improvement RMDQ-score baseline one year ( 12 month ) follow-up antibiotic treatment group placebo group . Analysis ( chi-square test ) perform three different cut-offs ( &gt; 75 % , &gt; 50 % &gt; 30 % improvement RMDQ score baseline one year follow-up , respectively ) . Intention-to-treat ( ITT ) principle use significance level 0.05 . Investigators report exact p value number need treat ( NNT ) 95 % CI . Analyses MRI result include observer agreement analysis ( kappa , McNemars test , Bland Altmann plot ) multiple regression analyse assess relationship clinical variable . Cost-effectiveness analyzed difference cost 2 treatment group divide difference QALYs gain . The result present incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) . In addition outcome measure list , follow evaluate : - To check Blinding : Patients ask study medicine ( Amoxicillin / placebo / unsure ) think receive . Points time : post-treatment ( 100 day start intervention ) , one year ( 12 month ) start intervention . - To evaluate Compliance medicine protocol ; Patients ask every week intervention period many day last week take study medication ( 0-7 ) ) . At post-treament ( 100 day start treatment ) ; Capsule count perform pharmacist . - Adverse event Registered CTC-coded every study visit ( =monthly ) intervention period principal investigator .
