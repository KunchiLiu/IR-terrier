	<brief_summary>This study investigate relative risk benefit use two common material coverage skin incision cesarean delivery . We perform first prospective first randomize control trial examine use standard postoperative dress versus skin glue coverage close skin incision cesarean delivery . The hypothesis use skin glue coverage incision associate decrease wound complication increase patient satisfaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dressing Versus Glue ( 2-Octyl Cyanoacrylate ) Coverage Skin Incision After Closure During Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given plethora literature regard technical aspect perform cesarean delivery , give large number procedure perform year available prospective trial ( approximately 700 cesarean delivery per year Danbury Hospital ) , quality level I evidence broadly consider influential area research . Therefore propose RCT incision coverage dress versus glue cesarean delivery . On admission L &amp; D schedule cesarean section , admission L &amp; D labor , patient ask participate Trial Coordinator admit Obstetrics Gynecology resident physician . Patients admit labor ask participate give possibility may ultimately require cesarean delivery , use patient admit scheduled cesarean delivery would eliminate urgent emergent cesarean delivery trial , therefore decrease generalizability trial result general obstetrics practice . When consented patient undergoes cesarean delivery , patient 's surgeon decide skin closure perform placement staple suture . The circulate nurse OR open one set sequentially numbered , opaque seal envelope ( SNOSE ) indicate patient 's allocation coverage incision dress glue . The circulate nurse tell surgeon group patient allocate . Before closure incision , care take ensure hemostasis subcutaneous tissue skin edge . If subcutaneous tissue &gt; 2 cm thick , tissue layer approximate closure skin currently level I evidence-based recommendation base multiple RCTs promote current clinical guideline . Choice suture material needle run subcuticular closure , use staple closure , per surgeon 's preference . If allocate coverage dressing , standard dress applied member surgical team standard fashion follow : The closed incision cover first primary dress consist nonadherent , composite dressing ( Telfa ) , cover secondary dress consist Army Battle Dressing ( ABD ) , removal sterile surgical drape . This dress hold place adhesive fabric tape , currently Mefix tape , typically applied surgical scrub tech . If allocate coverage glue , dress place . After closure incision suture staple , incision pat dry sterile condition . The incision cover longitudinally member surgical team thick layer skin glue dispense 1 tube surgical skin glue ( 2-octyl cyanoacrylate , currently use brand : Derma+Flex QS ) . The glue allow dry sterile surgical drape remove . Staples place incision closure routinely remove day discharge . Sutures place skin closure absorbable therefore remove .</detailed_description>
