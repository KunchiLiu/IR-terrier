	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Adults With Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I/II clinical trial key objective evaluate safety third party bone MSCs intravenous infusion 10 adult inherit severe skin fragility disorder , recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa ( RDEB ) . The main objective study : ( 1 ) ass spectrum clinical response adult RDEB receive intravenous MSCs ; ( 2 ) identify best cohort individual target future trial therapy ; ( 3 ) improve understand vivo vitro responsiveness MSCs ; ( 4 ) identify candidate molecule germane activate MSCs make clinically potent , independently permissive condition patient ( 5 ) ass impact reduce disease morbidity/severity population . This prospective , non-randomised , open label study . All study participant receive two intravenous MSC infusion baseline Day 0 Day 14 follow 12 month period follow first infusion . Each subject undergo initial screen include physical examination , assessment vital sign disease severity assessment .</detailed_description>
