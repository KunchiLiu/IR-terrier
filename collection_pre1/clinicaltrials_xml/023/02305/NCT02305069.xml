	<brief_summary>Obesity human show result increase release small inflammatory-inducing protein , call cytokine , fat cell body . The investigator interested effect cytokine mechanism control muscle mass metabolism obese human . Previous research work cell animal show cytokine reduce synthesis muscle proteins simultaneously enhance rate breakdown , result loss muscle mass . Furthermore , research suggest cytokine may inhibit carbohydrate oxidation , pivotal step muscle metabolism . However , despite potential negative consequence skeletal muscle function , effect low-level persistent inflammation see obese human , remain largely unknown . In current study , investigator plan measure rate synthesis breakdown muscle proteins conjunction rate carbohydrate oxidation obese old participant , compare rate determine healthy non-obese individual . Furthermore , participant undergo 12-week course either pioglitazone , insulin sensitiser often prescribe type II diabetic , placebo . Pioglitazone show previously normalise level cytokine blood chronically inflamed individual . By repeat 12-week intervention period initial measurement describe , accurately determine level cytokine , identification negative effect obesity-induced inflammation old adult muscle metabolism determine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recruitment subject : 24 obese ( otherwise healthy ) participant elevate cytokine level 24 non-obese subject normal cytokine level recruit . Following first experimental visit ( see ) , participant divide double-blind fashion four group ( n=12 ) . In previous study utilise similar low-grade inflammatory state thiazolidinediones administer , significant difference ( P &lt; 0.05 ) process investigation observe group size 10 . Therefore group size 12 selected accommodate anticipate 15 % dropout see long-term study . Participants male , age match ( &gt; 55 year ) , non-smoking , live sedentary lifestyle non-vegetarian . Before take part study , subject undergo medical screen complete general health questionnaire . This include measure blood pressure , heart rate , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , blood biochemistry blood clot profile . For non-control subject , inclusion study determine measure waist circumference ( &gt; 100 cm ) , inflammatory status ( non-obese subject C-reactive protein ( CRP ) plasma level &lt; 1.35 μg.ml-1 tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFα ) plasma level &lt; 3.3 pg.ml-1 obese subject CRP &gt; 1.35 μg.ml-1 TNFα &gt; 4.1 pg.ml-1 ) . Following explanation study associate procedure , write consent obtain subject make aware free withdraw point . Subjects recruit via press advertisement local population . Experimental trial : At start 12-week long study , muscle protein synthesis leg protein breakdown determine subject via administration stable-isotopes leucine phenylalanine concomitant two-stage insulin clamp simulate go fast fed state . This establish baseline value measure prior 12-week intervention period . These measure achieve single visit execution establish protocol determination muscle protein synthesis leg protein breakdown . In summary , achieve follow perform : basal muscle biopsy thigh obtain serum insulin concentration hold fasting level muscle biopsy obtain ; take serum insulin concentration elevate mixed amino acid administer simulate feeding follow take third final muscle biopsy . The take biopsy allow determination isotope incorporation thereby determination muscle protein synthesis leg protein breakdown rate . Following first experimental visit , subject start 12 week treatment period either pioglitazone ( 30 mg•day-1 ) placebo , administer double-blind fashion . Subjects monitor interval throughout period ensure compliance report unwanted side effect . After 12 week drug placebo administration , subject return laboratory repeat measurement determine first experimental visit ( muscle protein synthesis leg protein breakdown response simulate feeding ) . Circulating level select cytokine additionally examine blood sample collect subject start two experimental visit ( pre- post- 12-week drug intervention period ) , thus allow assessment associate change systemic cytokine concentration muscle protein synthesis leg protein breakdown . Study protocol : The study involve two visit separate 12-week drug intervention period . At two visit muscle protein synthesis leg protein breakdown rate response simulate feeding assess use establish experimental protocol describe : Subjects ask abstain alcohol exercise 48 h prior experimental visit arrive morning experimental visit fast state . Subjects ask rest semi-supine position cannula insert retrograde superficial vein dorsal surface non-dominant hand blood sampling . The hand keep hand-warming unit ( air temperature 50-55°C ) arterialise venous drainage hand . A cannula place antecubital vein forearm infusion insulin , octreotide , glucose , amino acid stable-isotope infusion leucine phenylalanine simulate feeding precise manner ; catheter place femoral vein allow , conjunction arterialised-venous ( A-V ) blood sample , arterial venous blood sample across leg . To assess muscle protein synthesis leg protein breakdown rate response feeding , serum insulin initially maintain fasting concentration administration insulin ( 0.6 mU•m-2•min-1 ) 120 minute , prevent endogenous insulin production , Octreotide ( 30 ng•kg-1•min-1 ) . Then , simulate feeding , serum insulin concentration increase equivalent fed state 120 minute ( ~40 mU•l-1 ) 20g mixed amino acid ( Glamin® Fresenius-Kabi , UK ) administer infusion conjunction glucose stabilise blood glucose concentration ( ~4.5 mmol.l-1 ) . Infusions stable isotope version phenylalanine leucine maintain throughout experimental visit . Initially , single prim dose [ 2H5 ] phenylalanine ( 0.33 mg•kg-1 body mass , 98 atom % excess ) [ 1-13C ] leucine ( 0.8 mg•kg-1 body mass , 99 atom % excess ) administer , follow constant infusion 0.5 mg•kg-1•h-1 phenylalanine 1.0 mg•kg-1•h-1 leucine . The use two stable-isotopes combination muscle biopsy obtain vastus lateralis muscle leg = 0 , 120 240 min blood sample throughout visit , allow muscle protein synthesis leg protein breakdown rate response feeding calculate . At regular interval throughout experimental period , respiratory gas exchange monitor measure oxygen ( O2 ) uptake carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) production use ventilate hood indirect calorimeter ( NutrEn , UK ) calculate respiratory exchange ratio . After completion initial visit baseline measure muscle protein synthesis leg protein breakdown response feed establish , 12-week drug intervention period begin . On completion 12-week intervention , study visit describe repeat determine effect intervention outcome measure list . Sample collection : At start experimental visit , 8 ml blood collect venous cannula ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) vacutainers .
