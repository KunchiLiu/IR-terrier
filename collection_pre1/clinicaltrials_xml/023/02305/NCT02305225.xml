	<brief_summary>The investigator examine change decision making , vigilance cortical excitability healthy male subject undergoing total acute sleep deprivation ( 40 hour ) one hand , chronic partial sleep restriction ( 7 night 5 instead 8 hour bed per night ) hand , cross control manner . The investigator hypothesize total sleep deprivation , well partial sleep restriction lead impairment decision make vigilance , enhance cortical excitability . Beside three primary outcome , investigator also assess change sleep EEG , dim light melatonin onset , skin temperature , subjective mood sleepiness , work memory , also collect saliva sample .</brief_summary>
