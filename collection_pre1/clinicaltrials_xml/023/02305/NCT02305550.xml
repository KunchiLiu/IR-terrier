	<brief_summary>Study Design : This two-part physiological device feasibility . Both study proof concept descriptive pilot study . The FIRST PART study healthy volunteer SECOND PART patient pulmonary hypertension routine cardiac catheterization laboratory ( CATH-LABORATORY ) . Volunteers patient enrol sequentially ; group randomization . Overall hypothesis device feasibility study : To test lightweight portable method synthesize therapeutic level inhale nitric oxide air electrical pulse discharge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Proof Concept Study Electrical Discharge Produced Nitric Oxide Inhalation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background . Inhaled nitric oxide routinely used treat acute pulmonary hypertension infant , child adult . By 2014 estimate 500,000 US patient treat nitric oxide , rare complication methemoglobinemia report high inhaled dos . Rationale . The investigator explore novel alternative lightweight economical method local nitric oxide production . In particular investigator synthesize nitric oxide air electrical pulse plasma discharge . After 2 year study investigator design produce prototype device synthesize nitric oxide air low level nitrogen dioxide ozone . After complete experimentation lamb , investigator plan study nitric oxide generator proof concept clinical study . Design study : The study comprise two part : 1 . HEALTHY volunteer study , 2 . CATH-LABORATORY study patient . The study conduct low level breathe nitric oxide , 25 part per million nitric oxide , 20 minute comply threshold Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) daily work exposure . The first portion study carry 6 healthy volunteer breathe 25 part per million nitric oxide . After first part , investigator proceed second portion study enroll 6 patient pulmonary hypertension undergo schedule test nitric oxide-pulmonary vasodilator response ( CATH-LABORATORY study ) .</detailed_description>
