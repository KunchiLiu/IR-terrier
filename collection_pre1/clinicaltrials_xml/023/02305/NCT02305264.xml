	<brief_summary>In study plan image compartmentalize inflammation MS use molecular image positron emission tomography ( PET ) highly resolutive camera . Two tracer study compare : ) [ 18F ] DPA-714 , bind peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) , target mainly express activated microglial cell . This new ligand PBR display several advantage compare exist reference compound PK11195 term brain entrance , signal noise ratio , radiolabelling possibility [ 18F ] ii ) [ 18F ] -fluoro-desoxy-glucose ( [ 18F ] FDG ) , reflect glucose metabolism activate immune cell white matter . Progressive MS patient ( secondary progressive primary progressive ) compare relapsing-remitting patient healthy volunteer . All subject pass complete neurological evaluation multimodal MRI document clinical disability tissue injury . A clinical radiological follow perform 2-year period . This study help understand contribution intracerebral inflammation progression disability could provide surrogate marker therapeutic trial chronic progressive MS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design This study prospective cross-sectional control multicentric clinical study 45 MS patient 20 control . Four group person include compare : - Group I : 20 healthy volunteer age 18 65 year . These healthy volunteer match age sex patient ( 1/2 ) . - Group II : 15 patient age 18 65 year relapsing-remitting ( RRMS ) , less 10 year evolution since first manifestation recent relapse . - Group III : 15 patient age 18 65 year secondary progressive MS ( SPMS ) , less 10 year evolution since occurrence secondary progressive phase . - Group III : 15 patient age 18 65 year primary progressive MS ( PPMS ) diagnose since less 10 year . Study centre MS patient 20 healthy volunteer recruit Hospital Pitie-Salpetriere MS patient recruit Hospital Tenon This study perform complementary team already collaborate molecular imaging trial MS ( assess neuronal loss demyelination/remyelination ) : ) `` Centre d'Investigation Clinique '' ( Salpetriere hospital , Paris ) , strongly experienced coordination clinical translational research MS ; ii ) CENIR ( centre neuroimaging research , Salpetriere hospital , Paris ) specialize MRI centre research neurological disease ; iii ) SHFJ ( DSV , CEA , ORSAY ) world class molecular imaging centre ; Study duration Per patient study last two year Per control study last 8 week</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion Healthy volunteer ( group I , n=20 ) Aged 1865 year ; Able understand objective procedure study , give inform consent . Patients relapsingremitting MS ( group II , n=15 ) Aged 1865 year Clinically definite MS accord McDonald revise criterion Less 10 year evolution No clinical relapse past 3 month Able understand objective procedure study , give inform consent Patients progressive MS ( group III IV , n=15 per group ) Aged 1865 year Clinically definite MS accord McDonald revise criterion SPMS evolve since 10 year group III ( n = 15 ) . PPMS evolve since less 10 year group IV ( n=15 ) . Each progressive patient experience significant progression 2 year precede inclusion ( estimate progression EDSS score least 0.5 point ) . No clinical relapse past 3 month Able understand objective procedure study , give inform consent . Exclusion criteria Any reason , allow perform MRI : claustrophobia , pacemaker intraocular foreign body example . For woman : pregnancy , lactation , lack efficient contraception . At visit 2 , positive pregnancy test lead exclude patient . Uncontrolled diabetes Current symptom severe uncontrolled renal , hepatic , hematological , gastrointestinal pulmonary cardiac disease . Positive HIV test Prior participation research protocols clinical care last year radiation exposure would exceed annual guideline . Other chronic neurological disease .</criteria>
