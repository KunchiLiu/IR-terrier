	<brief_title>Effects Long-term Intensive Home-based Physiotherapy Older People With Operated Hip Fracture Frailty ( RCT ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There increase need develop new model rehabilitation postpone old people 's disability institutional care . One alternative home-based rehabilitation emphasis functional-based exercise nutrition . Our objective study effect home-based physiotherapy 12 month follow 12 month ' follow-up older people ( 65+ ) , either operate hip fracture sign frailty . The primary outcome measure duration living home ( vs. assist live institutional care ) . Power calculation base assumption 24 month person assign physiotherapy live home six month longer vs. usual care . Usual care follow standard care procedure South Karelia social health care district ( Eksote ) , Finland . The population Eksote area 133 , 000 . Secondary outcomes physical functioning , fall , health-related quality-of-life ( HRQoL ) , use cost social health service , mortality . We recruit 300 person hip fracture 300 sign frailty . After operation , person hip fracture transfer surgery unit rehabilitation hospital , spend approximately four week discharge . The patient group include person frailty sign . They screen among outpatient inpatient use modify frailty questionnaire Abellan van Kan et al . ( 2008 ) Morley et al . ( 2012 ) . Diagnosis frailty base Fried´s criterion ( 2001 ) . Both patient group randomize separately intervention arm ( home-based physiotherapy twice week 12 month ) control arm ( usual care ) , result 150 patient group . Physiotherapy carry private physiotherapist , train follow intervention protocol . Physiotherapy individually design meet patient 's functional capacity need time progressive . Each physiotherapy session include muscle strength endurance training ( especially low limb ) , balance coordination train functional training . Functional training include activity daily live ( ADL ) walking exercise . In addition , physiotherapist give counsel nutrition ( base Mini Nutritional Assessment , MNA ) follow participant´s weight . An assessor-physiotherapist performs measurement participant 's home baseline , 3 , 6 12 month . Assessments include , among others , modify Fried 's frailty criterion , Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) , Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) , HRQoL ( 15 D ) , MNA , Falls Efficacy Scale - International ( FES-I ) , Social Provision Scale ( SPS ) , Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , Geriatric Depression Scale-15 ( GDS-15 ) . In addition collect register data live housing condition , use cost social health care service , mortality end follow-up ( 24 month since begin study ) .
