	<brief_summary>Adult patient moyamoya disease ( MMD ) report suffer considerable impairment executive function/attention . Although reduced cerebrovascular reserve ( CVR ) frontal area detect perfusion MRI confirm associated executive dysfunction adult MMD , structural functional change still unclear progression executive dysfunction . Furthermore , important study association neurocognitive radiological improvement surgical revascularization , help detect cerebral region involve executive deterioration improvement surgery . Then investigator determine whether region use indicator decide rational therapeutic schedule time adult MMD executive dysfunction . Thus aim study primarily find neuropsychological radiological correlate adult MMD , quantitatively evaluate effectiveness surgical revascularization prevention executive dysfunction adult MMD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous study adult moyamoya disease ( MMD ) reveal vascular cognitive impairment ( VCI ) consequence ischemic damage dynamic factor cerebral hypoperfusion , rather cerebral gray matter . However , still unclear region affect MMD region respond progressive cognitive decline . In way , investigator need detect spatial pattern brain activity MMD order understand pathophysiological nature . Surgical revascularization accept effective form treatment prevent future ischemic episode . However , effectiveness cognitive protection still unknown . Thus , investigator determine quantitatively evaluate cognitive radiological outcome adult MMD postoperatively follow-up .</detailed_description>
