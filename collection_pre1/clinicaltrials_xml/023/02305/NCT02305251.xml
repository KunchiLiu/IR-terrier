	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct study `` Resect Discard Diminutive Polyps : new paradigm '' ( IRB ID # 201105473 ) September , 2011 July , 2013 . This study examine whether doctor perform colonoscopy accurate enough predicting histology small colorectal polyp , small polyp could resect discard ( instead send pathology ) . One main advantage approach significant cost saving reduce pathology cost associate screen surveillance colonoscopy . A disadvantage 0.03 % chance small polyp contain cancer . There data regard patient preference toward approach . The investigator therefore design patient survey determine patient 's view toward approach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Preferences Resect Discard Paradigm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( ASGE ) publish review article new paradigm colorectal cancer screening term `` resect discard '' . This new paradigm challenge current practice send colorectal polyp , regardless appearance size , pathology analysis . `` Resect Discard '' describe new approach small polyp could remove , discard instead sent pathology analysis . This base data show gastroenterologist predict pathology small colorectal polyps 80-90 % accuracy , discard small polyp would alter surveillance recommendation . Neither ASGE document publish research , however , assess patient attitude toward approach . This study survey patient prior first time screen colonoscopy , order determine preference resect discard approach ; specifically would patient willing pay pathology analysis small colorectal polyps money , factor influence decision . We also inquire factor would influence decision pay/not pay pathology cost .</detailed_description>
