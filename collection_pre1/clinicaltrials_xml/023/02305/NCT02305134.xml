	<brief_summary>Tipepidine ( 3- [ di-2-thienylmethylene ] -1-methylpiperidine ) use solely nonnarcotic antitussive Japan since 1959 . The safety tipepidine child adult already establish . It report tipepidine inhibits G-protein-coupled inwardly rectify potassium ( GIRK ) -channel current . The inhibition GIRK channel tipepidine expect modulate level monoamine brain . We put forward hypothesis tipepidine improve attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) symptoms modulate monoaminergic neurotransmission inhibition GIRK channel .
