	<brief_title>A Biological Prospective Study Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic NETs Treated With Everolimus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>• Background : : Everolimus report effective compare placebo well/moderately differentiate pancreatic NETs term progression-free survival ( PFS ) improvement . However , number patient refractory upfront become resistant month therapy . Therefore , crucial detect biological factor help identify responsive tumor . Everolimus biological agent mechanism action partially direct towards angiogenesis . This studied different level different method . Upfront early surrogate predictive marker activity/efficacy studied tumor tissue , tumor imaging , peripheral blood . Tumor study diffusion-MRI angiogenic circulate marker study also marker response compare morphological imaging . - Material Methods : 1 . Circulating Endothelial Cells ( CECs ) Circulating endothelial progenitor ( CEPs ) perform flow cytometry . The monoclonal antibody use search CECs CEPs include : cluster differentiation antigen 45 ( CD45 ) , CD31 , CD133 , CD146 , CD34 , VEGFR-2 , 7-amino-actinomycin D ( 7-AAD ) Syto1 . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , VEGFR-2 thrombospondin-1 ( TSP-1 ) also detect peripheral blood . 2 . On tumor tissue follow determination perform , include : - Subtype 2 somatostatin receptor , - Phospho-AKT - Phospho-mTOR - Phospho-4E-BP1 - Phospho-p70-S6 kinase Rabbit anti-tuberous sclerosis complex 2 ( TSC2 ) Cell Signaling Technology - Mouse anti-PTEN Cell Signaling Technology 3 . Diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) show able provide information regard cellular density property extracellular matrix apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) value calculate use DWI serve marker cellularity . Given tumor cellularity contribute largely cellular proliferation , ADC value surrogate biomarker tumor-cell proliferation . ADC-Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) perform baseline , 1 month three month therapy . - Study design Baseline , 1 month therapy , three month therapy progression : - Abdomen DWI-MRI - CEC , CEPs - Circulating VEGF , VEGFR-2 , bFGF , TSP-1 Baseline biopsy metastatic site possibly new biopsy time tumor progression Correlation biological parameter clinical outcome ( tumor response progression free survival , Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors , RECIST 1.0 criterion ) • Statistical analysis : This exploratory study potential predictive value biological factor ( CECs , VEGF bFGF among ) express term reduce risk progression patient advance pancreatic NETs treat Everolimus . We use two-tailed log-rank test ( α = 0.05 , 1-β = 0.20 ) test hypothesis 30 % reduction risk ( hazard rate ; HR ) equal HR = 0.30 belong follow layer : - ≥ 2.2/uL v &lt; 2.2/uL CEC basal - ≤ 65.6 v &gt; 65.6 FGF level two month since start treatment - ≤ 32.5 v &gt; 32.5 VEGF level two month since start treatment The sample size calculate compensate power loss log-rank test assume average uniform log-rank test drop-out 10 % bearing mind threshold value refer 25th , 75th 50th percentile distribution CEC , bFGF , VEGF , respectively . Considering accrual rate 20 patients/year , treatment period 12 week follow-up 1 year sample size equal 43 patient , study total length 3 year 6 month .</detailed_description>
