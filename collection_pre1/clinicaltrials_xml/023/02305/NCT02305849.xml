	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety ASP015K Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) Who Had Inadequate Response Methotrexate ( MTX ) Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study multi-center , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel-group , confirmatory study evaluate efficacy safety ASP015K administer combination MTX patient RA inadequate response MTX . Subjects orally receive ASP015K placebo daily ( QD ) combination MTX breakfast 52 week . At Week 12 , inadequate responder placebo group , determine &lt; 20 % improvement baseline ( i.e. , treatment initiation day ) tender painful joint count ( TJC ) swell joint count ( SJC ) , switch ASP015K , dosage maintain end treatment . In addition , subject receive placebo Week 28 switch ASP015K , dosage maintain end treatment . The ASP015K dose start placebo group subject Week 12 Week 28 randomly choose baseline . The dose switch blinded condition . Subjects complete study eligible participation open-label extension study ( 015K-CL-RAJ2 ) . Subjects make follow-up visit Week 52 visit enroll extension study day Week 52 visit</detailed_description>
