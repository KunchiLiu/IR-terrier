	<brief_title>Comparison Between Letrozole Laparoscopic Ovarian Drilling Women With Clomiphene Resistant Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome ( PCOS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) common endocrine disorder reproductive age , incidence 5 -10 % . Classically clomiphene citrate ( CC ) first approach induce ovulation patient PCOS . Although 70-80 % PCOS woman ovulate treatment CC , 40 % PCOS woman become pregnant . Women ovulate increase dos CC describe CC-resistant remain major challenge gynecologic endocrinology . Traditional alternative CC-resistant patient include gonadotropin therapy laparoscopic ovarian diathermy . Letrozole orally-active aromatase inhibitor , good potential ovulation induction . Letrozole act reduce estrogen production block androgen estrogens conversion . Additionally , adverse effect endometrium cervical mucus ( 4 ) . This release pituitary negative feedback estrogens release FSH . Also , add positive effect increase follicular sensitivity FSH amplification FSH receptor gene expression . Laparoscopic ovarian drilling ( LOD ) avoid reduce need gonadotropin ovulation induction . Several potential mechanism action LOD also suggest . The reduction inhibin production follow LOD follow increase FSH secretion recruitment new cohort follicle . Other theory restoration normal production putative gonadotropin surge laparoscopic ovarian electrocautery . Moreover , drainage androgen inhibin follicle surface may inhibit excessive collagenisation overlie ovarian cortex facilitate Softening ovarian tunica . Neighbouring follicle undergo atresia may mature gain access ovarian surface , facilitate ovulation . Initiation normal inhibin B pulsatility LOD appear correlate postoperative onset ovulatory cycle . The main drawback LOD adhesion formation ovarian atrophy . That minimise number diathermy point avoid diathermy near ovarian hilum recommend . All woman clomiphene resistant PCOS attend subfertility clinic Cairo university hospital invite participate study . PCOS diagnosis base chronic anovulation sonographic picture polycystic ovary . Clomiphene resistance define failure ovulation spite receive 150mg clomiphene citrate 5 day start 3rd-5th day menstrual cycle . Exclusion criterion age &gt; 40 year , cause infertility , hyperprolactinaemia , previous Letrozole LOD therapy , body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 35 . The study explain participant write informed consent obtain participation . Full history take follow complete examination sonographic evaluation . Sonographic picture polycystic ovary define least 12 follicle 2-9mm ovary and/or ovarian volume &gt; 10cm3 140 woman clomiphene resistant PCOS randomly divide 3 equal group use computer generate random number . Group 1 receive Letrozole , group 2 LOD group 3 act control group intervention . Group 1 receive Letrozole ( Femara® , Novartis , Switzerland ) 2.5mg twice daily 5 day start 3rd day menstruation progesterone withdrawal bleeding . Group 2 LOD ovary stabilise grasp ovarian ligament monopolar diathermy use 4-10 puncture ovary . The number puncture individualise accord size ovary . Serial vaginal ultrasound scan do start 10th day menstruation , frequency monitoring individualize accord woman 's response . When dominant follicle reach 17mm woman receive Human chorionic gonadotrophin ( Choriomon® IBSA , Switzerland ) 5000IU timed intercourse advise 36 hour later .</detailed_description>
