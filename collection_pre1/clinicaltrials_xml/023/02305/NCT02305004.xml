	<detailed_description>Patients treat intensive care unit ( ICU ) treat variety sedative analgesic drug able undergo intensive care . The amount drug patient receives base standard dosage dose regimen base clinical study limit number patient include . Most patient treat intensive care unit vary degree cardiac , renal liver failure affect metabolism drug administer . Possibly , drug concentration achieve standard dosage administer patient vary significantly patient . This may possibly lead extended stay ICU give patient unnecessary suffering , affect patient ` family increase cost health care . Intoxications due suicidal purpose common usually result intensive care survive . It often unknown type medication drug patient take serum concentration may result . Screening method available information give u today may enough initial acute care patient . Also , previous study reliable documentation regard drug concentration blood patent die intensive care unit . It also unknown kind drug amount dos give death patient . It significant importance increase knowledge area able evaluate medicine administer death patient intensive care could affect outcome . Blood sample take accord routine procedure upon patient arrival ICU 2 time per day . The drug analysis include drug use sedation analgesia . These sample analyse national board forensic medicine ( Rättsmedicinalverket ) Linköping . There also screen unknown suspect drug take self- intoxicated patient . Sedation ratio Richmond agitation sedation scale ( RASS ) evaluate record 3 time per day . An assessment visual analogy scale ( VAS ) do patient awake able cooperate .
