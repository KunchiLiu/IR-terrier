	<brief_title>Physical Capacity Rehabilitation Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single center , retrospective prospective study . In order ass efficiency usual rehabilitation propose patient day hospital , assessment systematically perform rehabilitation program : 1 . Assessment muscular strength fatigue : Assessments voluntary force usually perform context evaluation patient . The isokinetic dynamometer CON-TREX ® device provide quantified result torque develop predetermine joint area constant speed also define advance . The assessment include assessment strength isometric contraction ( 40 90 degree knee flexion ) concentric contraction ( 30 , 60 90 degree per second ) . Fatigue evaluate two self-administered questionnaire : Fatigue Severity Scale Modified Fatigue Impact Scale . 2 . Effort test : The aerobic capacity patient assess triangular maximal exercise test . The effort test perform cycle ergometer triangular incremental exercise . Beforehand , blood pressure ECG record establish patient safely achieve gradual stress test . Heart rate , blood pressure , oxygen consumption , feeling ( Borg scale ) ECG record immediately immediately end test every minute least 5-10 minute recovery phase . 3 . Clinical assessment : The Timed Up Go test use assess patient 's capacity postural transition . This time quantitative assessment duration need change sit chair , get walk three meter , make U-turn come back sit . The 10 meter test quantifies walk speed patient ( meter / second ) 10 meter A test ascend descending10 stair also perform , well 6 minute walk test . In addition functional assessment , clinical test conventionally perform measurement muscle strength ( Medical Research Council scale ) , range motion , spasticity ( modified Ashworth scale ) assessment balance posture . The SEP-59 questionnaire use ass patient quality life .</detailed_description>
