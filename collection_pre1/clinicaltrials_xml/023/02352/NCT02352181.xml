Indeed liver transplantation surgery high risk bleed due coagulopathy develop patient eligible , due coagulation factor synthesis deficiency cirrhotic liver . On hand standard coagulation profile poor reflection coagulopathy patient imbalance pro- anti-coagulant factor take account PT aPTT measure . Management intraoperative hemorrhage may facilitate ROTEM速 perform whole blood allow detection abnormality balance pro- anti-coagulant factor .
