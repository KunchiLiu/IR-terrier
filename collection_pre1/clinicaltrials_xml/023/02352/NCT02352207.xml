	<brief_summary>This research focus lung malformation detect fetus prenatal ultrasound exam . Pathogenic mechanism rare malformation poorly understood . Improved knowledge need , give family well information , good standardize treatment decision The main goal well predict neonatal complication associate malformation , identify key predictive marker fetal period . To achieve objective , plan include 400 pregnant woman prenatal diagnosis pulmonary malformation 45 health center France . This large study topic international level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Factors Neonatal Respiratory Distress Newborns With Prenatally Diagnosed Congenital Lung Malformations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective study develop prognostic model estimate risk neonatal respiratory distress child prenatally diagnose congenital pulmonary malformation . The study offer pregnant woman refer Center Prenatal Diagnosis ( CPD ) , due identification congenital lung malformation fetus . This study induce change clinical therapeutic monitoring propose team charge mother . At inclusion , prenatal evaluation , prenatal parameter enter e-CRF . In effort minimize potential intra- interoperator variability malformation measurement time , study include standardize centralized evaluation ultrasound MRI ( available ) acquisition volume measurement . When place delivery determine , contact make birth team ( maternity , neonatology , intensive care unit ) , neonatal data also collect prospectively . A phone call family plan end first postnatal month , identify respiratory event would occur return home childbirth first month . The routine follow-up child ensure accordance current national recommendation , conjunction reference center rare respiratory disease child ( 28 university hospital , spread across region France ) . A telephone survey every 6 month refer physician specialize center , alternatively , family , collect clinical outcome age 2 year . If surgical intervention plan within interval , consent collect part surgical specimen research purpose solicit . This tissue immediately frozen -80 Â° C , allow laser microdissection DNA extraction epithelial cell line malformation ( Inserm U955 ) . Frozen tissue conserve biobank Necker-Enfants Malades .</detailed_description>
