	<brief_title>Everolimus Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies With TSC1 , TSC2 , NF1 , NF2 , STK11 Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer molecularly heterogeneous disease comprise complex genomic alteration common overlap pathway . Somatic inactivating mutation tuberous sclerosis complex 1 ( TSC1 ) gene recently identify potential marker response mTOR therapy . Everolimus oral derivative rapamycin . At cellular molecular level , everolimus act signal transduction inhibitor , selectively inhibits mTOR . We hypothesize everolimus exhibit clinical activity solid malignancy harbor TSC1 , TSC2 , NF1 , NF2 , STK11 mutation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm diagnosis advance ( metastatic , recurrent , unresectable ) cancer mutation follow gene : TSC1 , TSC2 , NF1 , NF2 STK11 . Must fail least 1 standard care systemic therapy malignancy Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 10 mm CT scan , &gt; 20 mm chest xray , &gt; 10 mm caliper clinical exam . Prior therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery ) allow complete least 2 week prior registration treatmentrelated toxicity resolve ≤ CTCAE grade 1 , exception alopecia hematologic value otherwise meet bone marrow function criterion specify . At least 18 year age . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Normal bone marrow organ function define : Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL Total serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x IULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x IULN ( ≤ 5.0 x IULN patient liver metastasis ) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN OR creatinine clearance &gt; 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Fasting cholesterol ≤ 300 mg/dL OR ≤ 7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x IULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication Able swallow tablet . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , must use highly effective method contraception study 8 week . Women consider postmenopausal childbearing potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g. , age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week prior randomization . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm followup hormone level assessment consider childbearing potential . Male patient whose sexual partner ( ) woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception study 8 week end treatment . Able understand willing sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) A history malignancy ≤ 3 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . Taking investigational agent within 4 week initiation everolimus . Symptomatic brain metastasis . Known brain metastasis allow asymptomatic previously treat . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition everolimus agent use study . Known impairment GI function GI disease may significantly alter absorption oral everolimus . Currently take CYP3A4 inhibitor inducer ( antiepileptic drug phenytoin , carbamazepine , phenobarbital ; cyclosporine ; grapefruit juice ; Seville oranges ; starfruit ; St. John 's wort ) Chronic treatment corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Received live attenuate vaccine within 1 week start everolimus ( i.e . intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella , TY21a typhoid vaccine ) . Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus define HbA1c &gt; 8 % despite adequate therapy . Patients known history impair fast glucose diabetes mellitus may include ; however , blood glucose antidiabetic treatment must monitor closely throughout trial adjust necessary . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure NYHA class III IV , active coronary artery disease , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , myocardia infraction ≤ 6 month prior start everolimus , uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic pressure &gt; 150 mmHg diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg ) , uncontrolled seizure disorder , liver disease cirrhosis , decompensated liver disease , active chronic hepatitis , know severely impaired lung function ( spirometry DLCO 50 % less normal 02 saturation 88 % less rest room air ) , active bleeding diathesis , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 14 day study entry . Known HIVpositivity combination antiretroviral therapy potential pharmacokinetic interaction everolimus . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
