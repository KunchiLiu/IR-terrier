	<brief_summary>The purpose proposal conduct replication study Family Nurture Intervention ( FNI ) CHoNJ . FNI facilitate mother-infant interaction vital early development . These include early repeat mother/infant calming interaction NICU stay , interactive touch vocal soothing , sustain reciprocal olfactory exposure family practice comforting , systematically implement skin skin hold . This already study CHONY . Findings reveal infant receive FNI significant increase EEG power , measure brain activity , near term age , compare receive Standard Care . There two group ; STANDARD CARE ( SC ) INTERVENTION ( FNI ) . In addition , 10 pilot subject enrol train staff involve procedure use Randomized Control Trial ( RCT ) . The pilot patient enrol identical study patient encourage participate fully . They include analysis RCT . The STANDARD CARE group receive current standard care NICU . The INTERVENTION group , addition standard care , receive FNI intervention , facilitated Nurture Specialists . In addition SC FNI group , third non-randomized group infant born term age receive standard care newborns CHoNJ . Assessments NICU include physiological measure ( ECG EEG ) , measure maternal sensitivity record mother-infant interaction variety specimen collection ( saliva , blood , breast milk sample ) . The investigator conduct two follow study , 4 month correct age 12 month correct age . The investigator test immediate long-term effect approach development preterm infant . The investigator hypothesize intervention alter wide range index physiological regulatory capacity , increase brain activity measure EEG ( power coherence ) brain activation pattern intervention group similar full term infant oppose standard care group . Longer term index mother psychological infant neurobehavioral outcome also improve assess first month life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare value current approach encourage contact mother baby ( Standard Care ) NICU wide ranging enhance approach ( Family Nurture Intervention ) . This approach base enhance aspect maternal nurture include mother-infant reciprocal calming , vital early development . A specific goal improve mother 's view baby , reduce negative emotion deliver baby prematurely , help gain confidence caretaking ability . Since preterm baby often easily upset , study facilitate mother comfort calm baby . An early study Morgan Stanley Children 's Hospital New York ( CHONY ) show positive outcome enhance treatment group variety area , include EEG brain activity term age . Assessments NICU secondary follow-up measure 4 , 12 month age test immediate long-term effect new enhanced approach nurture prematurely born infant . We undertake replication study patient NICU CHoNJ confirm elucidate positive effect enhance nurture . We hypothesize enhanced nurturing alter wide range physiologic regulatory capacity , reduce morbidity , decrease Length Stay ( LOS ) increase brain activity measure EEG ( power coherence ) . In addition approach may influence brain activation pattern ( particularly area anterior cerebral cortex responsible executive decision-making ) intervention group similar full term infant . Longer term measure mother 's psychological infant 's neurobehavioral outcome also improve assess first month life . This study aim replicate build exist study Morgan Stanley Children 's Hospital New York ( CHONY ) compare current protocol encouraging mother/infant interaction ( standard care ) multifaceted intervention enhance mother infant bonding ( Family Nurture Intervention - FNI ) . The FNI pilot studied cohort 150 mother-infant pair CHONY begin 2009 . While study ongoing , significant difference brain activity preterm infant find term measure EEG power intervention premature infant compare standard care group , increase risk morbidity mortality intervention group . The study demonstrate approach may influence brain activation pattern ( particularly area anterior cerebral cortex responsible executive decision-making ) intervention group similar full term infant ( 38-42 week gestation ) . This research warrant investigation good intervention strategy reduce morbidity ameliorate adverse outcomes infant . The purpose current study determine whether finding CHONY replicable , efficacy FNI protocol improve developmental outcome preterm births different cohort ( CHoNJ ) compare outcomes patient two different hospital environment . The study compare current standard care NICU , include periodic skin-to-skin holding , Family Nurture Intervention ( FNI ) add intervention : interactive touch vocal soothing , sustain reciprocal olfactory exposure , family model practice comfort well systematic implementation skin-to-skin holding . The behavioral , neurobiological clinical insight gain project may eventually lead good prevention developmental disorder , reduce morbidity effective clinical intervention strategy neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) discharge . We hypothesize treated baby show good result primary outcome measure short term secondary long term compare infant undergo standard care .</detailed_description>
