	<brief_summary>This study Phase III , randomise , open label , multi-centre study assess efficacy safety MEDI4736 versus Standard Care NSCLC patient PD-L1 positive tumour combination MEDI4736 plus tremelimumab ( MEDI4736+treme ) versus Standard Care NSCLC patient PD-L1-negative tumour treatment male female patient locally advance metastatic NSCLC ( Stage IIIB-IV ) , receive least 2 prior systemic treatment regimens include 1 platinum-based chemotherapy regimen NSCLC . Patients know EGFR ( Epidermal growth factor receptor ) tyrosine kinase ( TK ) activate mutation anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangement eligible study ( prospective testing plan within study ) . The Standard Care option : EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( erlotinib [ TARCEVA® ] ) , gemcitabine vinorelbine ( NAVELBINE® ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Global Study Assess Effects MEDI4736 , Given Monotherapy Combination With Tremelimumab Determined PD-L1 Expression Versus Standard Care Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study umbrella design 2 sub-studies : sub-study A ( randomize patient PD-L1 positive tumour 1:1 MEDI4736 vs. Standard Care ) sub-study B ( randomize patient PD-L1 negative tumour 2:3:1:2 MEDI4736 vs. MEDI4736 plus tremelimumab vs. tremelimumab vs. Standard Care . Two substudies may different duration recruitment period due difference patient population ( PD-L1 expression ) . They may run concurrently start completion recruitment potentially occur different time point .</detailed_description>
