	<brief_summary>Postmenopausal woman , men , prone central android obesity . Abdominal fat mass associate increase cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . In type 2 diabetic ( T2D ) patient , risk CVD mortality double compare age-matched subject . Most exercise program design weight loss focus steady-state exercise ( SEE ) around 30 min moderate intensity several time week . Disappointingly , kinds exercise program lead little fat loss ( Shaw et al . 2006 ) . Accumulating evidence suggest high intensity intermittent exercise ( HIIE ) potential effective exercise protocol reduce fat overweight individual , especially abdominal level ( Boutcher 2011 , Kessler 2012 ) . Despite result , HIIE program never use TD2 postmenopausal woman favor specific decrease abdominal fat mass . The aim study compare effect 16-week steady-state exercise ( SSE ) program high intensity intermittent exercise ( HIIE ) program total abdominal visceral fat mass T2D postmenopausal woman . It hypothesize HIIE compare SSE program would result significantly great reduction total abdominal visceral fat mass .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overweight obesity level escalate worldwide , trend occur develop develop country . Fat mass precisely abdominal fat mass link development cardio-vascular disease ( CVD ) . Postmenopausal woman , men , prone central android obesity . In type 2 diabetic ( T2D ) patient , risk CVD mortality double compare age-matched subject . Most exercise program design weight loss focus steady-state exercise ( SEE ) least 30 min , 2 3 time week . Disappointingly , kinds exercise program lead little fat loss ( Shaw et al . 2006 ) . Accumulating evidence suggest high intensity intermittent exercise ( HIIE ) potential effective exercise protocol reduce fat overweight individual , especially abdominal level ( Boutcher 2011 , Kessler 2012 ) . HIIE involve brief high-intensity , anaerobic exercise follow brief slightly longer bouts low-intensity exercise . The aim study compare effect 16-week steady-state exercise ( SSE ) program high intensity intermittent exercise ( HIIE ) program total abdominal visceral fat mass T2D postmenopausal woman . 30 T2D postmenopausal woman randomly assign SSE ( n= 15 ) HIIE ( n= 15 ) group . Subjects perform two session week , bicycle , 16 week . SSE : For SSE protocol , subject perform 40 min 50 % MAP ( maximal aerobic power ) HIIE : For HIIE protocol , subject perform 8 sprint 12 turn pedal slowly ( 20 30 r.p.m . ) maximum 60 repeat session . Total body regional fat content measure use dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) intervention ( 4 month ) . The contribution visceral fat total abdominal fat determine compute tomography ( CT ) . The effect HIIE SSE program : - Total fat mass ( appendicular fat mass ) ( DXA ) - Total fat free mass ( appendicular fat free mass ) ( DXA ) - Glycemic profile ( plasma HbA1c , plasma glucose ) - Lipid profile ( TG , HDL , LDL , total cholesterol ) - Food behavior training ( questionnaire ) also compare . Gaussian distribution data test Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . Data present mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . Comparisons group make Mann &amp; Whitney U test ANOVA appropriate . Relationships data assess Pearson correlation . Significance accept p &lt; 0.05 level . Statistical procedure perform use Statistica .</detailed_description>
