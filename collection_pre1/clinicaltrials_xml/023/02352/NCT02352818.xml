	<brief_summary>The aim CTO registry gather data include patient demographic date , cardiac risk factor , procedural technical data procedural success/outcome rate . Furthermore , aim evaluate safety performance various CTO specific guidewires , device ( CrossBoss/Stingray dissection ren-entry device ) recognise approve technique ( retrograde wire escalation , retrograde dissection re-etry technique ) . The incidence recognize complication ( dissection , perforation , cardiac tamponade , vascular complication , radiation injury , acute kidney injury ) also evaluate . We assess clinical outcome 1 year succesful CTO procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronic Total Occlusion Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This objectives single-center CTO registry : 1 . Gather prospective clinical data consecutive patient undergo complex difficult CTO PCI procedure include include patient demographic date , cardiac risk factor , procedural technical data ( contrast volume , radiation exposure , procedure time procedural success/outcome rate . 2 . Evaluate safety performance various CTO dedicate guidewires , device ( CrossBoss/Stingray anterior dissection re-entry device ) recognise approve technique ( retrograde wire escalation , retrograde dissection re-etry technique ) . 3 . Evaluate incidence severity recognize complication coronary dissection , coronary perforation ( +/- need emergency pericardiocentesis ) , acute kidney injury , radiation injury , access site vascular complication . 4 . Evaluate medium-term outcome ( recurrence symptom , major cardiovascular event ( cardiac death , myocardial infarction , target lesion revascularization , target vessel revascularization ) routine out-patient consultation ( planned part normal standard care ) 1 year post successful CTO PCI . After consultation , patient may choose cardiology follow-up UZ Leuven his/her refer cardiologist .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All consecutive patient undergo elective attempt percutaneous revascularization chronic total occlusion eligible inclusion CTO registry . A chronic total occlusion define occluded coronary artery TIMI 0 flow occlude 3 month . By definition patient judge acceptable candidate attempt revascularization consent part CTO registry . There specific exclusion criterion . If patient wish consent personal data keep registry patient include CTO registry .</criteria>
