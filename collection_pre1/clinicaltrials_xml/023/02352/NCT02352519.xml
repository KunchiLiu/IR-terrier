	<brief_summary>In research study , investigator try find two method inject local anesthetic ( site belly button cut ultrasound guide rectus sheath block ) provide good pain relief less need pain medication surgery child undergo single incision laparoscopic appendectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison UGBRS Block Local Infiltration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic appendectomy common procedure pediatric surgery . For single incision laparoscopic appendectomy ( SILA ) , laparoscope instrument insert aid large trocar single umbilical incision . Laparoscopic appendectomy via single umbilical incision less invasive procedure associate minimal scarring compare traditional laparoscopic operation . Postoperative pain , nausea vomit common problem encounter laparoscopic appendectomy abdominal operation . As establish standard practice Texas Children 's Hospital , pain control patient achieve intravenous opioids via patient control device along ketorolac tromethamine , well local anesthetic infiltration ( LAI ) perform surgeon bilateral rectus sheath block describe . The umbilical area innervate bilateral 9th , 10th 11th intercostal nerve , run internal oblique transversus abdominis muscle . At lateral edge rectus muscle , nerve perforate rectus sheath innervate rectus muscle . Anterior cutaneous branch cross muscle supply skin umbilical area . Successful blockade relevant intercostal nerve within rectus sheath provide effective pain relief umbilical midline surgical incision . Rectus sheath block also show give good pain control compare intra-incisional infiltration intra-peritoneal injection patient undergo laparoscopic gynecologic surgery . Recently , show improved efficacy decrease local anesthetic requirement ultrasound use guide rectus sheath block child undergo umbilical hernia repair . However , data compare pain ultrasound guide bilateral rectus sheath block ( UGBRSB ) peri-umbilical local anesthetic infiltration ( LAI ) SILA available . The incidence postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) high laparoscopic surgery , dose-related increase note opioids use postoperative period . Effective regional anesthesia may decrease opioids use consequently reduce incidence PONV improve patient satisfaction .</detailed_description>
