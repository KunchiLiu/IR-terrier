	<detailed_description>The study extension previously conclude publish study electrochemotherapy colorectal liver metastasis ( Edhemovic et al . JSO 2014 ) . In extension 15 patient include . Four group patient include . The patient group 1 2 patient 3 unresectable liver metastasis , demand excessive resection , untreatable standard thermal ablative method due close proximity major blood vessel . Electrochemotherapy offer patient treatment option . In case multiple , resectable non-resectable liver metastasis , latter treat electrochemotherapy , whereas metastasis resect treated RFA . These group patient : 1 . Patients one three ( 1-3 ) metachronous liver metastasis colorectal cancer , large 5 cm , position unresectable liver area , near blood vessel , otherwise operable patient . 2 . Recurrent liver metastasis colorectal cancer , 3 large 5 cm diameter , . For patient treatment could represent unacceptable risk due possibility insufficient liver residual resection less effective radiofrequency ablation due proximity blood vessel . Groups 3 4 include patient intent cure within standard care use two-stage surgical approach . This two-stage surgical approach allow add electrochemotherapy first operation tissue collection histological analysis second operation . Adding electrochemotherapy patient affect treatment within standard care recommend current guideline . These group patient : 3 . Patients synchronous metastasis , general condition extent disease allow simultaneous removal primary tumor metastasis . During first operation , primary tumor remove ( colorectal resection ) liver metastasis treat electrochemotherapy . About 6 week later , second operation liver metastasis , treat non-treated metastasis remove liver resection . 4 . Patients bilateral , multiple , metachronous metastasis standard treatment includ two-stage liver resection , due extent disease and/or general condition . During first operation , right portal vein ligate metastasis leave side excise ablated radiofrequency ablation . At time , three metastasis right side treat electrochemotherapy . During second operation , treat non-treated metastasis right side remove right hemihepatectomy . Electrochemotherapy offer patient also refuse standard treatment . Depending position metastasis , appropriate electrode select ; hexagonal needle electrode fix geometry metastasis large 3 cm diameter , low edge locate 3 cm liver capsule . ECT perform base standard operate procedure treatment cutaneous subcutaneous tumor / metastasis ECT . Individual electrodes , position accord prepared treatment plan use metastases 5 cm diameter , locate near vena cava large hepatic portal vein . Electrochemotherapy perform within 8-28 min intravenous bolus administration bleomycin ( 15 mg/m2 ) . Triggering electric pulse synchronize ECG signal , ECG trigger device AccuSync avoid delivery pulse vulnerable period heart . All patient treat procedure thoroughly describe , sign informed consent .</detailed_description>
