	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy `` gold standard '' technique diagnosis treatment colonic lesion . Moreover , high definition colonoscope ( HD ) associate digital chromoendoscopy show well result regard adenoma polyp detection compare standard non HD scope . However , evidence show standard colonoscopy many lesion could miss , include polyp , cancer kind lesion . This could correlate many factor recently report show evidence lesion behind fold could miss limitation forward view examination . Until know , new auxiliary imaging device call `` Third Eye Retroscope '' demonstrate lesion detection colonoscopy use retro view , limitation absence HD vision , need additional equipment fact device occupies accessory channel , limit therapeutic efficiency . Recently new HD colonoscope call `` RETROVIEW '' ( PENTAX Medical ) develop . It permit visualization colonic mucosa forward view , retroflex view allow performance diagnostic therapeutic single colonoscope .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary outcome : To determine safety feasibility retro view colonoscopy use RETROVIEW colonoscope . Safety measure number bleed perforation rate adverse event procedure . Feasibility measure number case possible achieve retroflexion colon Secondary outcome : withdrawal phase time total procedure time .</detailed_description>
