	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common form arthritis Hong Kong prevalent condition age population . With disease progression , client may develop severe pain profound limitation ambulation , may result morbidity impaired physical function . Among available treatment , pharmacological therapy primarily focus musculoskeletal pain relief . However , adverse effect , gastrointestinal haemorrhage arise non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug lead increase number concern regard use treatment . Other non-invasive complementary method osteoarthritic knee ( OA knee ) explore limitation pharmacological therapy . Auriculotherapy ( AT ) one approach traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) . It therapeutic method specific point auricle stimulate treat various disorder body . The present study four-arm randomise control study determine effectiveness AT use magneto-AT ( MAT ) and/or laser AT ( LAT ) improve condition elderly patient suffer OA knee . The effectiveness MAT LAT term alleviate pain , relieve stiffness promote range motion , enhance functional ability determine . Subjects 'Treatment arm 1 ' receive MAT specific auricular point one side ear treatment session . A deactivated laser use achieve effect subject blinding . Subjects 'Treatment arm 2 ' receive LAT use low-energy laser apply select acupoints ear , plaster centre portion Junci Medulla mimic MAT treatment also give . Subjects 'Treatment arm 3 ' receive combine approach ( MAT LAT ) . Subjects 'placebo arm ' serve placebo control . Six auricular acupoints consider effect OA knee select . Only one ear time receive treatment . Thus , ear treat alternately . The total treatment period four week . The experimental object replace every day . Therefore , treatment perform thrice week . Subjects assess baseline 3 month therapy . This study could advance knowledge complementary approach use improve OA knee condition elderly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives study 1 . To assess feasibility AT among elder OA knee future large-scale study , include use blinding ( subject evaluator ) , acceptance treatment protocol , follow-up repetitive testing , estimate effect size attrition rate . 2 . To evaluate preliminary effect MAT , LAT combine approach among elder OA knee . 3 . To elicit subject ' experience towards use AT clinical trial . Design : This study double-blinded randomise control trial 2 x 2 factorial design , nest qualitative study elicit experience subject towards use AT OA knee . Stage I : RCT factorial design Experimental control intervention Eligible subject randomly blindly allocate one four group , decide computer-generated randomised table . Restricted randomisation block use ensure approximately similar sample size group time trial accord equal proportion rule ( 1:1:1:1 ) . The random allocation sequence manage specify research assistant ( RA ) involve trial conceal assessor . Treatment arm 1 ( MAT &amp; placebo LAT ) : Subjects receive MAT . The magnetic pellet contain average ~200 gauss/pellet magnetic flux density , diameter 1.76 mm . The experimental object apply reactive region six select acupoints detect acupoint detector . The justification select acupoints describe . To achieve blind placebo effect subject , laser device switch `` power '' mode ( i.e . deactivate laser ) acupoint `` stimulation '' prior application MAT . Subjects ask wear pair laser protective goggles `` blind '' therapy administration . Treatment arm 2 ( LAT &amp; placebo MAT ) : Subjects receive LAT . A laser device ( pointer pulse ) use study . This device wavelength 650 nm , average output power 2.5 mW , energy density 1 minute 0.54 J/cm2 , pulse 10 Hz , common acceptable dosage clinical use . This application belong low-energy laser therapy ( LLLT ) , energy level emit device approximately comparable teach pointer . A 1-minute treatment use continuous mode device directly apply reactive region six select acupoints ear . Laser protective goggles provide subject researcher eye protection . Similarly , plaster without magnetic pellet mimic MAT treatment apply six acupoints LAT . Treatment arm 3 ( Combined MAT &amp; LAT ) : Subjects receive combine approach use MAT LAT . LAT administer prior application MAT select auricular point , would implement similar procedure group A B . Placebo arm : Subjects serve placebo control , receive LAT `` power '' mode ( i.e . deactivate laser ) acupoint `` stimulation '' application plaster without magnetic pellet mimic MAT treatment . To enhance blind effect subject , follow procedure standardize across four group : ( 1 ) The auricle participant clean use 75 % isopropyl alcohol prior administration therapy ; ( 2 ) one ear receive treatment time , ear treat alternately ; ( 3 ) treatment firstly apply right ear first visit , follow left ear second visit , ; ( 4 ) experimental object replace every day , thrice week ( except Sunday ) avoid local irritation auricular point treatment ; ( 5 ) subject give education talk booklet knee OA commencement study . The total treatment period last 4 week , follow visit 1-month 3-month . Therefore total number visit subject 15 ( i.e . 3 time week four week , 2 follow visit ) . Ear zone selection identification Six auricular acupoints think effect OA knee select , namely , `` shenmen '' , `` knee '' , `` spleen '' , `` liver '' , `` kidney '' `` subcortex '' . The Chinese Standard Ear-Acupoints Chart , recognise World Health Organization , use locate zone . Selection auricular acupoints base traditional Chinese medical theory well ideas borrow modern medicine . Participants settings Subjects 60 year old recruit community centre day care centre NGO partner . The therapy administer either Integrative Health Clinic School Nursing , The Hong Kong Polytechnic University elderly centre , wherever convenient subject . All therapy administer room assign research purpose . Only researcher client treatment allow stay room therapy . A warning sign caution laser radiation put visible place outside room worker member elderly centre . Inclusion/exclusion criteria The OA condition assess physical examination base clinical criterion American College Rheumatology criterion . The clinical criterion consist pain knee three follow : ( 1 ) age 50 year age ; ( 2 ) &lt; =30 minute morning stiffness ; ( 3 ) crepitus active joint motion ; ( 4 ) bony tenderness ; ( 5 ) bony enlargement ; ( 6 ) palpable joint warmth . This classification report yield 84 % specificity 89 % sensitivity diagnosis OA knee . The exclusion criterion : ( 1 ) connective tissue disease affect knee ; ( 2 ) knee joint steroid injection within precede three month ; ( 3 ) hearing aid pacemaker situ ( avoid possible interaction pacemaker magnetic pellet ) ; ( 4 ) receiving AT within precede three month ; ( 5 ) suffer aural injury infection ; ( 6 ) inability understand instruction give consent . The assessment conduct research assistant receive intensive coach physical assessment therapy administration research team . Potential subject assess register medical practitioner 15 year clinical experience assessment OA condition RA research team doubt . Proposed sample size A total 96 subject ( 24/group ) recruit feasibility study , take account estimate attrition rate 20 % . The primary outcome study , i.e . pain intensity measure Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) , use determine effect size study . Ethical consideration A write informed consent obtain every participant risk benefit study explain verbally write . Participation study voluntary basis , potential participant inform assure right refuse withdraw study time . Personal information data remain confidential anonymous . Side effect arise MAT rare . However , abnormal phenomenon mild dizziness procedure allergic reaction skin adhesive tape may possible . Such reaction diminish quickly tape remove , frequency occurrence reverse action monitor closely record . For LAT , procedure painless . The subject may sometimes feel slightly warm feeling acupoints administration subject experience `` Deqi '' feeling see benchmark effective treatment . Laser protective goggles specific wavelength laser device provide subject researcher eye protection . For qualitative interview , interview tape record permission participant . Application ethical approval Human Research Ethics Review Committee , The Hong Kong Polytechnic University , apply . Stage II : Qualitative interview Semi-structured interview conduct different group subject elicit detail description participant ' experience towards therapy . Purposive sample employed potential interviewee recruit participated stage I study . Participants arm recruit . The interview conduct Cantonese tape record . The interview guide serve start point interview assurance relevant topic address . Open-ended question , rather closed-ended lead question , use allow participant expound response obtain thick description . Due lack qualitative research research topic , interview question probe literature base . The interview guide develop first third investigator base clinical experience use AT . The length interview moderate last 40 minute average . Interviews conduct participant ' home Integrated Health Clinic ( IHC ) School Nursing . Two researcher collect data : one conduct interview , audio-record interview take field note . Clarification make use field note probe ensure data misinterpret . The interviewer recognize put aside personal view minimize subjective bias . Interview end data saturation mean new insight generate code emerge analysis interview transcript . ( b ) Qualitative data analysis Interviews conduct Cantonese tape-recorded transcribed verbatim . A constant comparison method use data analysis describe phenomenon interest , also develop code , category theme . Related code combine labeled category , category comprise main theme . Identified script translate English experience bilingual translator . The English version transcript undergoes backwards translation use compare original Chinese transcript . The backwards translation increase reliability English transcript use content analysis .</detailed_description>
