	<brief_title>Interventional Treatment Refractory Pneumothorax Bronchoscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-site , control , randomize study . Refractory pneumothorax challenge respiratory physician . Many patient present recurrent pneumothorax . Thoracic close drainage basic effective treatment pneumothorax . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) one main cause spontaneous pneumothorax . Many patient preclude performance surgery poor pulmonary function . In China , economical load another reason patient unwilling surgery . So want seek cheap , effective safe method refractory pneumothorax . We adopt three method study . Conventional thoracic close drainage continuously use control group , autologous blood perfuse target pulmonary segment treatment A group self-made silicone bronchial plug place target pulmonary segment treatment B group . The leak position detect biliary lithotomy balloon . Main outcome measure : duration continuous leakage . Secondary end-points include lung reexpanded , hospital cost hospital stay etc .</detailed_description>
