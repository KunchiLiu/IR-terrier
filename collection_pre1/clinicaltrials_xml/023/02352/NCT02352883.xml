	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) gene expression diagnose patient abnormal cell breast duct spread outside duct . MRI use radio wave powerful magnet link computer create detailed picture area inside body . MRI may help find diagnose patient breast cancer . It may also help doctor predict patient 's response treatment help plan best treatment . Genetic study may help doctor predict outcome treatment risk disease recurrence . Performing MRI genetic study may help determine best treatment patient breast cancer situ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Gene Expression Diagnosing Patients With Ductal Breast Cancer In Situ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion patient ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) diagnose core needle biopsy judge breast conservation candidate base upon standard imaging ( mammography +/- sonography ) physical examination ( ) convert mastectomy step 1 base MRI finding , ( b ) mastectomy final surgical procedure step 2 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess relation baseline clinical covariates ( e.g. , tumor grade , necrosis , histologic type , mammographic lesion size ) , MRI morphologic kinetic feature , DCIS score . II . To assess diagnostic accuracy MRI extent disease evaluation patient DCIS . III . To estimate proportion patient require re-operation inadequate excision MRI . IV . To estimate proportion patient proceed mastectomy initial attempt wide local excision either inadequate tumor-free margin ( &lt; 2 mm ) , reason . V. To estimate 5-year 10-year ipsilateral breast event ( situ invasive ) rate ( IBE ) among woman DCIS assess MRI preoperatively treat wide local excision without radiation therapy ( low DCIS score ) radiation therapy ( intermediate-high DCIS score ) . VI . To estimate proportion woman DCIS receive treatment concordant treatment goal concern . VII . To estimate proportion woman DCIS whose decision autonomy preference concordant perceive level decision involvement . VIII . To assess decision quality use knowledge score decision process . IX . To assess concordance decision autonomy preference perceive level decision involvement , knowledge decision process score independent predictor decision satisfaction first post-operative visit . X . To assess relationship patient-reported outcome disease-specific covariates , quality life treatment . XI . To assess role disease status , diagnostic test result surgeon recommendation predictor treatment receive . XII . To compare patient-reported diagnostic test burden bilateral mammography MRI measure Testing Morbidities Index ( TMI ) . OUTLINE : STEP 1 : ARM A : Patients undergo MRI prior surgery . Patients undergo additional imaging and/or biopsy indicate base MRI . STEP 2 : Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm base result MRI . ARM B : Patients undergo mastectomy . Patients register Step 3 . ARM C : Patients undergo wide local excision +/- re-excision . Patients may cross-over Arm B mastectomy indicate . Tissue sample collect surgery use calculate DCIS score use genetic analysis testing . Patients may proceed Step 3 . STEP 3 : Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm base result DCIS score test . ARM D ( DCIS score &lt; 39 ) : Patients undergo endocrine therapy direct . ARM E ( DCIS score &gt; = 39 ) : Patients undergo radiation therapy endocrine therapy direct . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year every 12 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
