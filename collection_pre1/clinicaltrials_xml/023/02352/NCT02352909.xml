	<brief_summary>From rehabilitation point view , several approach exist retrain runner PFPS , clear one effective , . The goal randomised-controlled trial : 1 ) compare effectiveness three rehabilitation program pain functional limitation runner PFPS 2 ) explain program effective base laboratory analysis . After baseline evaluation , runner randomly assign one three treatment group , specific 8-week rehabilitation program aim address efficiency specific type retraining . These group : 1 ) Control ; 2 ) muscle recruitment ; 3 ) reduce knee load running . The investigator hypothesis intervention target reduction knee load significantly effective reduce symptom improve function runner patellofemoral pain syndrome .</brief_summary>
