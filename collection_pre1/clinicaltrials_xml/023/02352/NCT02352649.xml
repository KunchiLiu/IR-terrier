	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety efficacy pl-vegf165 ( `` Neovasculgen '' ) regeneration peripheral nerve . Pl-vegf165 ( `` Neovasculgen '' ) permit Russian Federation angiogenic medication induce growth new vessel include complex therapy patient peripheral arterial disease Russia . It also show enhance nerve regeneration muscle reinnervation animal property previously study patient . Moreover , currently method clinical use speed rate recovery nerve injury . The objective study explore ability pl-vegf165 benefit treatment patient peripheral nerve injury . The investigator hypothesize treatment intraneural injection pl-vegf165 peripheral nerve reconstruction accelerate nerve regeneration , reduce period denervation improve muscle reinnervation recovery patient peripheral nerve injury .</brief_summary>
