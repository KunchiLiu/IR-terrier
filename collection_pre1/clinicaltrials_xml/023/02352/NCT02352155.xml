	<brief_summary>Bleeding peptic ulcer common medical emergency . Endoscopic treatment stop bleed actively bleed peptic ulcer , reduces bleeding , transfusion , surgery death . After initial endoscopic control bleeding , approximately 10 % develop recurrent bleeding . Mortality rate group patient least 4 fold high . In need surgery , mortality approach 30 % . Prevention bleed therefore major treatment objective . Currently investigator use high dose infusion proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) 72 hour render gastric pH neutral . In previous randomized trial , investigator show rate bleed 30 day around 7 % approach . In small subgroup high risk patient define presentation shock ulcer &gt; 2 cm size , 1 6 would re-bleed . An alternate strategy select especially high risk bleed repeat endoscopic treatment next morning . The investigator show persistence major bleed stigma , i.e . visible vessel , second endoscopy predict bleed . It therefore logical repeat endoscopic treatment next morning , investigator prevent bleed possibly surgery death . The current study proposes develop score identify risk bleed endoscopy . The investigator use historical cohort carefully collect clinical data derive risk score . In derivation phase 939 patient , investigator develop 9 point risk score consist follow parameter ( Age &gt; 60 , Male sex , ulcer &gt; 2cm , posterior bulbar location , spurt Forrest Ia bleed admission hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dl ) . Using AUROC Youden J statistic , score 5 show highly predictive bleeding . The score validate prospective cohort patient bleed peptic ulcer . In final phase study , investigator propose randomize controlled trial test hypothesis second look endoscopy treatment select high risk patient reduce bleed improve outcome . After endoscopic hemostasis bleed peptic ulcer , patient risk stratify base score . Those score 5 randomize receive standard treatment ( high dose PPI infusion ) second look endoscopy treatment addition PPI infusion . The primary outcome trial significant clinical bleeding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hospitalization bleed peptic ulcer decline past decade [ 1 ] . Bleeding peptic ulcer however remain common diagnosis present acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding ( AUGIB ) . The incidence around 60-80/100,000 population . Endoscopic hemostatic therapy first treatment active bleeding major stigma bleeding . Endoscopic therapy stop bleed reduces rate bleeding , requirement surgery importantly deaths [ 2 ] . Adjunctive intravenous infusion high dose proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) reduce rebleeding . In multicentre international placebo control trial involve 767 patient bleed peptic ulcer , PPI infusion reduce rate bleeding ( 10.3 5.9 % 72 hour , P=0.026 ) In subgroup analysis Cochrane meta-analysis use PPI bleeding peptic ulcer , adjunctive use PPI underwent endoscopic hemostatic treatment , compare without PPI therapy , associate reduction death ( 17/954 vs. 32/ 969 ; OR 0.54 ; 95 % CI 0.3-0.96 ) [ 4 ] . Despite aggressive endoscopic therapy maximal acid suppression use PPI infusion , bleed occurs around 8 % patient . Further bleed single important adverse prognostic factor associate 4 fold increase mortality . From National United Kingdom Audit management patient AUGIB , need surgery bleeding fail endoscopic control mortality 28 % [ 5 ] . In addition initial control bleed endoscopic therapy , prevention bleed important objective . The use routine second look endoscopy re-treatment evaluate several clinical trial . A recent meta-analysis [ 6 ] clinical trial conclude use routine second look endoscopy confers modest reduction rate bleeding . In pooled analysis 8 trial 938 patient , absolute risk reduction 6.8 % ( 16.5 9.7 % ) . The number treat prevent one episode recurrent bleed 15 . Only one trial use high dose PPI infusion epinephrine injection alone use endoscopic treatment . The use epinephrine injection longer consider optimal treatment . A second modality add induce vessel thrombosis [ 7 ] . Clinical practice report trial consider contemporary . In modern practice combination endoscopic treatment maximal acid suppression , use routine second look endoscopy recommend NNT prevent bleeding would likely higher . A policy routine second look endoscopy generally recommend suggested International Consensus Group [ 8 ] . Second look endoscopy high risk bleed however logical approach . The NNT prevent bleeding diminishes risk bleed increase . For instance , ulcer &gt; 2 cm size Forrest I Forrest II bleed would associate re-bleeding risk 15-20 % even high dose PPI infusion . Saeed et al . report study consist small number patient ( n=40 ) show endoscopic re-treatment select high risk patient base Baylor College score lead significant reduction bleeding ( 0 vs. 24 % ) . This selective approach warrant investigation could represent dominant strategy addition high dose PPI infusion pre-emptive management patient high risk bleeding . A prerequisite approach risk score predicts bleed patient endoscopic hemostasis PPI infusion . This risk score need derive large cohort patient uniform endoscopic treatment acid suppression . The score validate prospective cohort patient bleed peptic ulcer aggressive treatment . Furthermore , randomize control trial use second look endoscopy high risk patient identify risk score require .</detailed_description>
