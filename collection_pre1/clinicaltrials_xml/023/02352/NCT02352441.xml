	<brief_summary>Many Service member ( SM ) experience executive dysfunction associate mild traumatic brain injury symptom complex ( mTBI-sc ) , receive cognitive rehabilitation . Cognitive rehabilitation ( CR ) executive dysfunction often involve metacognitive strategy instruction ( MSI ) help patient self-regulate behavior though goal management process - identifying goal , anticipate performance problem , generate possible solution , self-monitoring performance activity , recognize maladaptive task strategy , stop modify real-time task behavior choose alternate strategy . MSI alone often result improved daily functioning require conscious cognitive oversight employ ( difficult people executive dysfunction ) presume simply establish goal propels goal-directed action , many people , . Social psychologists report people set implementation intention ( if-then statement link specific situational cue specific goal action ) likely perform goal action set goal intention . Implementation intention believe effective enable people switch conscious-effortful reflective action control automatic , reflexive action control associate select situational cue . A team researcher Courage Kenny Research Center ( CKRC ) , Traumatic Brain Injury Center Fort Campbell , KY ( TBIC-FC ) , Neurofunctional Research Consulting develop brief CR intervention teach SM mTBI-sc set implementation intention call ACTION ( AutomatiC iniTiation IntentiONs ) sequence training . The purpose pilot study evaluate : 1 ) practicality instructional method use teach SM mTBI-sc perform ACTION sequence 2 ) efficacy ACTION sequence training achieve personal goal performance task challenge executive function use small randomize controlled trial . If result positive , large study would conduct determine impact ACTION sequence training SM performance military-relevant task goal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim feasibility study follow : Aim 1 : Finalize ACTION training curriculum ; develop manual ; field test . - Work implementation intention research expert military consultant develop train task gradation schema informs identification modification exist implementation intention train task military face validity . - Finalize adherence support method train worksheet material . - Field test training task adherence support method small cohort civilian mTBI-sc CKRC assure feasibility . - Finalize ACTION sequence training manual ; assure intra-rater inter-rater reliability score quality implementation intention statement . Aim 2 : Evaluate ACTION sequence training instructional method ( extent SM mTBI-sc able learn establish IF-THEN statement potential trigger automatic enactment goal-actions extent SM mTBI-sc report train experience satisfactory beneficial ) . - Enroll 28 participant study ( SM mTBI-sc refer MSI TBIC-FC ) . - Evaluate whether participant correctly craft implementation intention use rubric score implementation intention develop participant clinic session home practice ; administer participation satisfaction survey posttest . Aim 3 : Test efficacy ACTION sequence training evaluate extent train 1 ) improve SM 's mTBI-sc ability perform complex test executive function ( e.g . Hotel Test ) 2 ) advance progress towards self-identified goal daily life ( via Canadian Occupational Performance measure [ COPM ] Goal Attainment Scaling [ GAS ] ) compare control condition . Additionally , determine level adherence complete daily homework practice an assign prospective memory task . - Collect pre-post data Hotel Test , COPM , GAS participant . - Collect data completion homework assignment - Collect data completion prospective memory task</detailed_description>
