	<brief_summary>Recently , target next generation sequencing ( NGS ) platform introduce allow inexpensive test hundred mutational hotspots time . A number additional mutational marker thyroid cancer identify . Highly promise marker associate tumor prognosis also find . This multi-institutional study aim validate diagnostic use mutational marker thyroid nodule indeterminate cytology . The propose hypothesis broad NGS-based genotyping thyroid nodule use large panel mutational marker apply thyroid FNA sample provide accurate cancer risk stratification thyroid nodule . The performance panel test multi-institutional double-blind prospective study FNA sample thyroid nodule indeterminate cytology available surgical outcome</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Thyroid cancer fifth common cancer type woman fast grow cancer diagnosis U.S . In 2013 , estimate 60,000 new case diagnose . However , thyroid nodule much common , particularly woman increase age . The prevalence palpable nodule population-based study 3-4 % prevalence non-palpable nodule incidentally identify imaging approach 40-50 % age 60 . Thyroid cancer primary clinical concern patient thyroid nodule , although small proportion ( ~5 % ) thyroid nodule malignant . The diagnosis thyroid cancer rely cervical ultrasound fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy cytologic examination . FNA cytology provide definitive diagnosis benign malignant thyroid disease case , although approximately 30 % nodule , FNA cytology reliably rule cancer case report indeterminate malignancy . Because lack definitive diagnosis , patient indeterminate cytology undergo diagnostic surgery establish histopathologic diagnosis . However , 20-30 % surgically resect thyroid nodule prove malignant . It estimate ~150,000 thyroid surgery perform U.S. benign nodule due inability rule cancer without surgery . Additionally , indeterminate preoperative diagnosis always lead optimal initial surgical intervention patient thyroid cancer , many undergo two-step surgery , i.e . thyroid lobectomy follow completion total thyroidectomy . Both unnecessary two-step surgery avoid accurate preoperative diagnosis cancer thyroid nodule . For patient sign informed consent , physician investigator perform research needle wash . The syringe rinse buff solution gather leave cell research sample . This FNA material collect potential molecular test collection tube store -20C . The first five sample acquire processed irrespective cytologic diagnosis evaluate collection technique . Those sample indeterminate cytologic diagnosis ( Bethesda III , VI , V ) surgical outcome submit molecular testing . ( Sample give code de-identifies sample send test laboratory . The lab analyze specimens CLIA certify Pitt lab . ) Molecular analysis perform Pitt lab without know surgical outcome .</detailed_description>
