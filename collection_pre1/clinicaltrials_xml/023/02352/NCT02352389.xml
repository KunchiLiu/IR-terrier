	<brief_summary>The purpose propose study gather critical information may useful design effective prevention treatment strategy control seasonal influenza influenza pandemic . In particular , critical question relate virus ' ability adapt efficient replication spread human . Influenza contagious respiratory illness cause influenza A B virus . Influenza infection result 230,000 hospitalization 36,000 death annually United States . Children cancer likely serious influenza complication underlie medical problem . They also likely prolonged influenza illness shed influenza virus nose long period time ( sometimes month ) . Recent study suggest influenza virus may also carry shed gastrointestinal tract . New type influenza virus emerge frequently mutation occur virus replicate . These mutation allow virus escape kill immune system , large part , responsible seasonal epidemic influenza occur fall winter month . It possible virus mutate carry respiratory gastrointestinal tract long period , potentially give rise virus spread easily person , cause severe disease , lead new influenza epidemic make virus resistant drug use treat influenza . Researchers St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital want learn influenza virus mutate immunocompromised child . They investigate long child cancer carry influenza virus nose , throat gastrointestinal tract characteristic mutation find virus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Influenza Viruses Isolated From Immunocompromised Children Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants nasal , oral stool specimen obtain time diagnose influenza infection , 7 , 14 , 21 28 day later . The genome influenza virus isolate participant sequence compare one another standard influenza strain . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To determine proportion pediatric oncology patient nasal oropharyngeal shed influenza virus 7 , 14 , 21 28 day follow diagnosis infection . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To determine proportion gastrointestinal shed human influenza virus . - To determine frequency pattern mutation influenza virus isolate pediatric oncology patient . - To explore biological consequence mutation influenza virus isolate pediatric oncology patient .</detailed_description>
