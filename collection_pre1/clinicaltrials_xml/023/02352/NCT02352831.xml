	<criteria>Histologically cytologically proven metastatic inoperable pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 10 mm CT scan MRI , &gt; 20 mm chest xray , &gt; 10 mm caliper clinical exam . Must progress , intolerant , refuse gemcitabinebased therapy . At least 18 year age . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Normal bone marrow organ function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL AST ALT ≤2.5 IULN ( ≤5X IULN liver metastasis present ) Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Able understand willing sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . Chemotherapy &lt; 2 week prior first plan dose study treatment . Radiotherapy &lt; 3 week prior first plan dose study treatment . A history malignancy ≤ 2 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . Currently receive investigational agent . Known brain metastasis . Patients know brain metastasis must exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition tosedostat capecitabine agent use study . Previous treatment aminopeptidase inhibitor . Previous exposure either 5FU capecitabine systemic dose except use concurrent chemoradiation . Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) deficiency severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min CockcroftGault formula ) , would preclude use capecitabine . Significant cardiovascular disease define : Myocardial infarction within 6 month screen . Unstable angina pectoris Uncontrolled clinically significant arrhythmia Grade ≥ 2 LVEF ≤ institutional limit screen Congestive heart failure NYHA class III IV Presence clinically significant valvular heart disease Baseline troponin I T &gt; IULN btype natriuretic peptide &gt; IULN . Prior exposure cardiotoxic agent , anthracyclines , within 3 month enrollment . Patient must QTc interval ECG ≤ 0.48 second Bazett 's calculation screening . Patient may take drug prolong QT/QTc interval . If patient drug , patient may enroll study drug discontinue least 5 halflives prior first dose tosedostat capecitabine . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Patients childbearing age must negative pregnancy test screen agree use contraception duration study . Known HIVpositivity combination antiretroviral therapy potential pharmacokinetic interaction tosedostat capecitabine . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
