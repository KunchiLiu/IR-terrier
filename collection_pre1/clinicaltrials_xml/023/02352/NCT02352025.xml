	<brief_title>S-equol Women With Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After baseline breast tumor core biopsy , eligible woman triple negative breast cancer ( ER- alpha , PR HER-2 receptor negative ) treat S-equol dose 50 mg twice daily period 14 day ( 10-21 day range ) . After completion treatment , second breast tumor sample obtain compare molecular change two specimen . The second pathology specimen may surgical resection breast tumor , repeat core needle biopsy , surgery plan . The primary endpoint absolute change Ki67 , validate marker tumor proliferation breast cancer . Secondary endpoint include assessment total ER-beta pY36 level measure immunohistochemical stain correlation S-equol effect . Further treatment surgical resection second core needle biopsy tumor guide tumor size , nodal status standard parameter , discretion treat physician . The Investigator hypothesize S-equol cause measurable decrease Ki-67 estrogen receptor beta express triple negative breast cancer , indicate potential efficacy tumor type .</detailed_description>
