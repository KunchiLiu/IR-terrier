	<brief_title>Study Pain Control With Hormonal IUS Insertion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrauterine system ( IUS ) among effective form reversible contraception . Numerous study demonstrate safety efficacy . Despite , uptake IUSs among U.S. young woman age 14 22 year low . Increasing use effective , long act contraception among young woman important public health goal , could help reduce high rate unintended pregnancy population . A major barrier young woman 's utilization IUSs fear pain insertion . Unfortunately , study evaluate method pain control IUS insertion focus adult woman , leave question unanswered best pain management method young woman . Compared adult woman , young woman less experience pelvic exam may therefore derive great benefit pain control measure gynecologic procedure , IUS insertion . Young woman provider seek effective pain control option ; yet , lack high quality , comparative effectiveness research guide decision making . This proposal seek fill important gap . With introduction Skyla IUS ( Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals , Inc. ) U.S. market January 2013 , new approach pain management become possible . Skyla small exist IUSs may therefore cause less pain insertion . The pain response trigger Skyla insertion may better control exist pain control option . This underlie premise study . In addition size IUS , theoretical empirical data suggest paracervical block great promise pain control IUS insertion compare pain control option . Paracervical infiltration local anesthetic cervix interrupt visceral sensory fiber low uterus , cervix , upper vagina . Data several clinical trial indicate paracervical block provide clinically significant control pain multiple type gynecologic procedure . One recently publish study evaluate effectiveness paracervical block IUS insertion find marginally significant reduction pain , study underpowered focused adult woman . The value paracervical block young woman receive IUS remain unclear . The investigator propose conduct randomize , control single-blind trial compare pain Skyla IUS insertion among young woman age 14 22 year randomize receive paracervical block versus sham cervical block . This study provide important information counsel young woman pain management IUS insertion .</detailed_description>
