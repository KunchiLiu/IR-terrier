	<brief_summary>Objectives : investigate effect 6 night sleep extension physical cognitive performance , total sleep deprivation ( 39 hour continuous awake ) subsequent recovery sleep . Design : Subjects participate two experimental condition ( randomize cross-over design ) : extend sleep ( 10-h bed , EXT ) habitual sleep ( 8-h bed , HAB ) . In condition , subject perform two consecutive phase : ( 1 ) six night either EXT HAB ( 2 ) three experiment day in-laboratory : baseline ( BASE ) , sleep deprivation ( TSD ) 10 h recovery sleep ( REC ) . Performance test administer every 3 hour 3-d laboratory . Setting : This cross-over randomize study conduct standardized laboratory condition continuous polysomnographic record Participants : 14 healthy men ( age range : 26-37 year ) participate study . Interventions : EXT vs. HAB sleep duration prior total sleep deprivation ( 39 hr continuous awake ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many human endeavor require high-level cognitive performance situation ( e.g. , health care , military operation , space flight ) along whole nycthemera ( i.e . 24-h cycle ) . It long establish acute total sleep deprivation ( TSD ) chronic sleep restriction impair ability maintain wakefulness , increase subjective sleepiness sleep propensity , critically reduce various aspect cognitive performance . In study conduct laboratory set different professional situation induce insufficient sleep , consistently dramatically impacted cognitive capacity sustain attention alertness . This degradation cognitive performance period sleep deprivation link increase sleep pressure , e.g . reduction latency sleep onset increase number involuntary micro sleep . To identify countermeasure deleterious effect sleep deprivation critical many professional area . Management wake/sleep cycle appear important impact alertness sleep deprivation ( e.g . sleep habit physical activity , see review . Recently , Rupp coll . ( 2012 ) report one week sleep extension realize one week sleep restriction ( 3 h/night ) influence rate degradation cognitive performance alertness period subsequent recovery period . In word , propose sleep `` bank '' period sleep loss may help sustain performance alertness . With different experimental paradigm ( i.e . without subsequent sleep deprivation ) , study show sleep extension ( realize different period time ) may improve physical performance , attentional performance , mood . The fact increase total sleep time period time represent attractive non-pharmacological countermeasure limit deleterious effect performance induce sleep privation . However , study cross-over randomized design assess effect relatively short period ( 6 night ) sleep extension performance , total sleep deprivation recovery . Moreover , direct measurement sleep pressure continuous EEG monitoring quantify micro sleep episode period sleep deprivation effect sleep extension physical performance know . Hence , aim study assess effect 6 night sleep extension ( EXT ) physical cognitive performance , alertness homeostatic sleep pressure , total sleep deprivation subsequent recovery day . The investigator hypothesize EXT would : ) partly prevent physical cognitive performance degradation-induced total sleep deprivation ii ) decrease sleep pressure , total sleep deprivation iii ) improve recovery speed physical cognitive performance .</detailed_description>
