	<brief_summary>The focus project evaluate diagnostic utility Shear Wave Elastography ( SWE ) individual routine low back injury begin initial investigation 's ability effectively guide physical therapy treatment dry-needling relevant treatment intervention . Specific Aim # 1 : Evaluate diagnostic utility SWE differentiating individual without LBP . The investigator also examine interaction tissue change clinical improvement . The investigator hypothesize individual LBP high muscle stiffness ( shear modulus ) rest impair ( low ) stiffness contraction individual without LBP . Specific Aim # 2 : Evaluate effectiveness dry-needling decreasing aberrant muscle stiffness individual LBP . The investigator hypothesize individual LBP receive dry-needling exhibit large change individual LBP receive sham dry-needling individual without LBP receive dry-needling . Specific Aim # 3 : Evaluate effectiveness dry-needling decreasing pain disability individual LBP . The investigator hypothesize individual LBP receive dry-needling exhibit large improvement individual LBP receive sham dry-needling .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Structural Health Monitoring Improve Diagnosis Treatment Low Back Injury U.S. Service Members- Phase 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain ( LBP ) second frequent reason health care visit lead cause medical evacuation theater . Traditional medical diagnosis base static imaging strategy ( e.g . MRI ) fail improve management epidemic . Functional assessment lumbar musculature use ultrasound image provide evidence clinically relevant deficit lumbar multifidus ( LM ) muscle patient LBP , however procedures likely valid within narrow range assessment condition . Shear-Wave Elastography ( SWE ) evolve non-invasive ultrasound image technology capable quantify tissue stiffness ( i.e. , elasticity ) . Originally develop improve diagnosis soft tissue tumor , SWE begin use alternative stable method functional assessment muscle . This study second project line research aim improve diagnosis , management , treatment patient LBP use new structural health monitoring technique call shear wave elastography ( SWE ) . Since previous study use SWE lumbar multifidus muscle , initial project develop measurement technique use device . We also establish normative parameter , variance , reliability estimate SWE outcomes asymptomatic individual . A previous study , also perform AMEDDC &amp; S , find individual LBP receive dry needle lumbar multifidus muscle exhibit reduction pain disability associate improved ability contract lumbar multifidus . The focus second project evaluate diagnostic utility SWE individual routine low back injury begin initial investigation 's ability effectively guide physical therapy treatment dry-needling relevant treatment intervention .</detailed_description>
