	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /Recommended Phase 2 Dose ( RP2D ) evaluate safety tolerability GC1118 give intravenous ( IV ) infusion patient stage IV solid tumor . The study also evaluate pharmacokinetics , immunogenicity antitumor effect GC1118 explore prognostic biomarkers pharmacodynamic biomarkers .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study GC1118 ( Recombinant Human Anti-EGFR Antibody ) Patients With Advanced Solid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open-label , single-arm , multi-center , phase 1 , dose-escalation study conduct define MTD/RP2D , safety , PK , immunogenicity antitumor activity GC1118 patient refractory disease standard therapy available . This study three part : dose escalation segment ( Part A ) , cohort expansion ( Part B ) biweekly administration ( Part C ) . In part A , dose escalation schema apply dose level cohort . GC1118 administer weekly Study Day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day cycle IV infusion . Dose escalation may occur described study protocol . Once MTD establish Part A , MTD cohort expand part B . And GC1118 administer biweekly Study Day 1 , 15 28-day cycle IV infusion part C. Study assessment include AE monitor include physical examination , vital sign clinical laboratory test , ECG monitoring , PK analysis serum GC1118 , assessment potential anti-GC1118 antibody response exploration potential prognostic pharmacodynamic biomarkers . Tumor response assessment use Study Day 36 CT/MRI scan perform approximately five week first GC1118 dose patient ( Part A ) . Patients evidence disease regression ( partial complete response stable disease RECIST criterion ) allow continue therapy dose . Subsequent cycle consist administration GC1118 Day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day cycle tumor evaluation every cycle ( approximately every 8 week ) part A , B Day 1 , 15 28-day cycle tumor evaluation every cycle ( approximately every 8 week ) part C .</detailed_description>
