	<brief_summary>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation develop cure many patient hematological malignancy . It result development graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) 30-70 % case . Chronic GVHD diagnosis currently use biopsy affect organ ( skin , liver , gastrointestinal tract ) / observation typical clinical sign sufficient diagnosis . However , anatomical site biopsy include digestive tract clearly identify ( high low biopsy ) may present risk realization particular patient weaken blood disease immunosuppression . PET-CT 18F-FDG already evaluate chronic inflammatory disease Crohns disease good sensitivity specificity . It interest graft host study acute form digestive allows lesion map monitor effectiveness treatment . Among patient chronic GVHD scleroderma form , PET 18F-FDG enable view musculoskeletal uptake localize affected area identify MRI . The investigator propose study evaluate sensitivity specificity examination PET-CT 18F-FDG diagnosis chronic GVHD compare conventional diagnostic tool .</brief_summary>
