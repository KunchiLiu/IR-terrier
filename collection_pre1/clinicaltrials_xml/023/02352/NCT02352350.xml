	<brief_summary>Blood lactate level measure use simple handheld device time return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) follow hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) . Patient outcome track include rate survival hospital discharge , rate 6 month survival , neurological status . The hypothesis pre-hospital study confirm previous in-hospital finding high blood lactate ROSC associate high mortality severe neurological impairment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective observational study primary cardiac arrest patient prehospital ( ROSC ) Alachua County , Florida . After Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) activation arrival scene cardiac arrest , paramedic Emergency Medical Technicians ( EMTs ) provide standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support ( ACLS ) follow 2010 guideline . This may include chest compression , early identification shock ventricular fibrillation ventricular tachycardia , obtain intravenous ( IV ) intraosseous ( IO ) access , administration IV IO epinephrine , amiodarone , pressor , oxygenation ventilation , treatment indicate reversible cause cardiac arrest . At time IV IO establishment small blood sample obtain blood measure blood lactate . EMS personnel specifically train delay care deviate standard resuscitation protocol obtain blood lactate sample . Current local paramedic protocol cardiac arrest general medical management include obtain IV access capillary blood draw thus blood lactate measurement require additional invasive procedure medical risk . As medical director Alachua County Fire Rescue ( ACFR ) well University Florida faculty member , Dr. Christine Van Dillen oversee paramedic training , protocol development , quality assurance Alachua County , Florida . Dr Karl Huesgen faculty physician University well , work closely ACFR regard . These investigator meet regularly ACFR administration provide mandatory paramedic EMT education . Incorporation lactate measurement standard cardiac arrest protocol accomplish monthly administrative update monthly in-person training session . Adherence investigative protocol monitor standard quality assurance program cardiac arrest review . Paramedics option use either capillary venous blood lactate measurement . This flexibility important cardiac arrest often chaotic substantial variability site cardiac arrest , time return spontaneous circulation ( e.g . IV access obtain cardiac rhythm restoration ) , patient anatomy ( e.g . poor venous access ) , provider resource ( e.g . presence additional rescue personnel ) , factor . Ideally blood lactate measurement occur IV insertion , though may measure later equally valid result fingerstick glucose measurement . Of note , medical provider instruct perform additional IV insertion fingersticks order obtain lactate measurement . Patients transport rapidly possible local hospital .</detailed_description>
