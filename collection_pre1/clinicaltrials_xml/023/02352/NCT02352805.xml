	<brief_summary>This observational clinical study investigate cellular plasmatic activation marker well proteins involve coagulation inflammation patient connect different extracorporeal circulation ( ECC ) circulatory support device intensive care condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Coagulopathy SIRS During ECC Intensive Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The complex interplay various factor contribute ECC-related coagulopathy inflammation intensive care setting poorly understand far . Furthermore , unclear , coagulopathy inflammation shall monitor anticoagulant may employ decrease complication associate specific ECC system . Therefore , use laboratory analysis , anticoagulation anti-platelet therapy varies different ECC system intensive care unit . A good understanding mechanism activation interaction platelet leukocytes , plasmatic coagulation , complement , cytokine endothelium highlight starting-points increase safety efficacy ECC intensive care medicine . The investigation phenomenon different ECC system clinical condition therefore goal study . In order achieve study goal , investigate cellular plasmatic activation marker well proteins involve coagulation inflammation patient connect different ECC system intensive care condition .</detailed_description>
