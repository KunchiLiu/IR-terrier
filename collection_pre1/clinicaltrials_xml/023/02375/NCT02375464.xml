	<brief_summary>Gallium-68 DOTATOC material use find neuroendocrine tumor ( NETs ) use positron emission tomography ( PET scan ) . The material already show well currently available image agent . This study design evaluate clinical impact PET CT scan use agent evaluation management patient NETs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gallium-68 DOTATOC Management Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients NETs evaluate physician . Before PET scan use Gallium-68 DOTATOC , physicians ask describe type treatment would recommend . After test perform result review , physician ask reevaluate therapeutic management option . Data analyze determine impact test patient management . Gallium-68 designate `` orphan drug '' due relative rarity NETs . It expect data collect similar trial use provide data FDA regard safety efficacy drug image agent NETs ultimately lead FDA approval .</detailed_description>
