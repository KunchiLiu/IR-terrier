	<brief_title>Study Bortezomib , Lenalidomide , Dexamethasone &amp; Elotuzumab Newly Diagnosed MM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational drug ( case elotuzumab ) combination lenalidomide , bortezomib dexamethasone learn side effect regimen whether effective newly diagnose multiple myeloma . `` Investigational '' mean drug elotuzumab combination agent lenalidomide , bortezomib , dexamethasone study . It also mean U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) yet approve elotuzumab treatment cancer . The drug , lenalidomide , bortezomib , dexamethasone approve FDA . Participants trial option undergo autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) follow initial therapy elotuzumab , lenalidomide , bortezomib , dexamethasone . ASCT standard care treatment multiple myeloma . All participant , include undergo ASCT choose , receive refer `` maintenance therapy '' - continuous treatment - initial cycle treatment elotuzumab , lenalidomide , bortezomib , dexamethasone . The specific maintenance regimen determine risk category .</detailed_description>
