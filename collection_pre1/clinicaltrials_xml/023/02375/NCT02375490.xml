	<detailed_description>Childhood obesity one great challenge face public health 21st century . In 2010 , estimate 43 million preschool age child suffer overweight obesity another 92 million risk overweight . From 1990 2010 , prevalence overweight obesity child age 5 increase 4.2 % 6.7 % , estimate 60 million child suffer overweight 2020 . In Canada , prevalence obesity preschool age child three time higher global average . Being overweight childhood associate compromised emotional health social wellbeing . Much excess weight obese child gain age 5 year many study indicate adiposity track childhood . Further , child become obese age 6 least four time risk obesity adulthood . The problem obesity multifactorial , primarily influence energy intake energy expenditure . Eating habit establish early childhood sustain many year . Data show 29 % Canadian preschool age child meet recommendation fruit vegetable intake 23 % grain product . Further , 79 % 4-5 year old consume food little nutritional value ( ex : chip , french fry , candy , chocolate , soft drink , cake cooky ) least week study demonstrate empty calorie make much 40 % total caloric intake . Similarly , recent review demonstrate physical activity ( PA ) level early childcare center ( ECC ) generally low , time spend sedentary state elevate . It estimate child ECC accumulate average 7 13 minute moderate-to-vigorous PA ( MVPA ) course 7 hour day . Correspondingly , recent data suggest prevalence child poor physical literacy high low physical literacy competence negatively associate PA , cardiorespiratory fitness weight status . These data trouble give sedentary physical activity level track time . Several organization recognize need counter pediatric obesity develop physical activity nutrition-based intervention pre-school population . More half young Canadians age 6 month 5 year spend around 29 hour week ECC , make rich environment implement strategy help child adopt healthy lifestyle . For example , one pilot study demonstrate increase fruit vegetable intake follow nutrition education increase availability healthy food ECC . Another intervention study integrate physical activity aspects preschool curriculum report 2 minute increase classroom MVPA assess accelerometer . However , systematic review obesity prevention intervention child 5 year another obesity prevention policy , practice intervention ECC report limited success current intervention positively influence physical activity level , dietary behaviour , body composition . The author suggest least successful intervention unidimensional , successful intervention positive impact knowledge , ability competence , suggest intervention conceive base comprehensive behaviour change model . It also find intervention focus physical activity eat behaviour combination , future intervention target behaviours simultaneously . Interventions promote healthy weight child encompass broad spectrum concert action base best available knowledge research practice . Healthy Start , intersectional multilevel physical activity healthy eating promotion preschool age child , develop base . The aim current study lead comprehensive evaluation Healthy Start intervention use experimental research design . The Intervention The population health approach base concept order positively influence population-level health outcome , one need account wide range health determinant [ 39 ] , recognise importance complexity potential interplay among determinant , reduce social material inequity . Further , intervention adhere principle population health approach rely best evidence available , stimulate intersectoral collaboration , provide opportunity potential stakeholder meaningfully engage development . Several model base population health approach develop help guide intervention . These model provide holistic conceptual framework , similar ecological model , suggest intervention include series concert action capable target level influence , include intrapersonal ( biological psychological ) , interpersonal ( social cultural ) , organizational , community , physical environment political level . The conceptual development Healthy Start base population health approach ; include strategy guide level influence aim improve child physical activity dietary behaviour . The development Healthy Start concert action include academician , community group , educator , parent , government representative . Their effort , support Phase I federal fund Public Health Agency Canada ( 2007-2010 ) , also involve pilot test improve intervention design multilevel , inclusive , intersectoral . It also noteworthy , Healthy Start develop linguistically culturally adapt cater official linguistic group Canada , important since documented effective , sufficient intervention translate , must also adapt target population . Therefore , Healthy Start design promote physical activity healthy eating among Anglophone Francophone 3-5 year old child ECC ( i.e . licenced daycare , preschools pre-kindergarten program ) . The vision Healthy Start ensure young child eat healthily physically active every day . The mission encourage enable family educator integrate physical activity healthy eat daily life young child . Specifically , Healthy Start attempt influence factor intrapersonal ( ex : eating physical activity behaviour child ) , interpersonal ( ex : educator parent ) , organizational ( ex . child care centre ) , community ( ex : community organization involvement ) , physical environment political level ( ex : build environment policy ) . These level influence target operational stand point , Healthy Start compose six interlinked component ( detail present Figure 1 ) : 1 ) intersectoral partnership conducive participatory action lead promote healthy weight community ECC ; 2 ) The Healthy Start guide educator implement healthy eating physical activity young child ; 3 ) customize training , role model monitor Healthy Start early learning centre ; 4 ) evidence-based resource , LEAP-GRANDIR contain material family educator ; 5 ) supplementary resource governmental partner ; 6 ) knowledge development exchange ( KDE ) , communication strategy involve social medium web-resources raise awareness mobilize grassroots organization community . Study Objectives It hypothesize , comparison usual practice , exposure Healthy Start intervention lead improve opportunity physical activity healthy eat increased physical activity healthier eating among child . The specific study objective : 1 . Investigate whether Healthy Start intervention lead increase child care centre-provided opportunity physical activity healthy eating ; 2 . Investigate whether Healthy Start intervention lead increase physical activity level healthy eating behaviour among child ; 3 . Investigate whether Healthy Start intervention lead improvement physical literacy among child .</detailed_description>
