	<brief_summary>Establishing breathe birth vital survival long-term health premature baby . 10 % preterm baby fail breathe birth require help breathing . When infant need help breathe clinical team place small mask baby face give breath help baby breath ( investigator call mask ventilation ) . This procedure do million time day around world several time day Royal Alexandra Hospital . Providing breaths via mask ventilation difficult step help baby breath birth . If provide wrongly baby receive enough oxygen , could damage brain even cause death . To keep skill level every staff member up-to-date every staff member require re-train rescue breath via mask ventilation every two year . The investigator believe enough daily training necessary keep skill up-to-date . The investigator aim compare different teach technique use daily training see either improves skill resuscitator provide mask ventilation The study last 7 month ( baseline observation ( 2 month ) , intervention period ( 3 month ) , After trial period ( 2 month ) The investigator use routinely used equipment record neonatal resuscitation investigator also routinely make video recording evaluate performance resuscitation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Establishing breathe oxygenation birth vital survival long-term health premature infant . 10 % preterm infant fail breathe birth require respiratory support . An international consensus statement recommend infant inadequate breathe bradycardia birth give positive pressure ventilation ( PPV ) via facemask T-piece device . Mannequin DR study show PPV difficult mask leak airway obstruction common problem PPV . Several factor poor facemask application result leak airway obstruction , spontaneous movement baby , movement distraction resuscitator , change wet towel put hat reduce effectiveness PPV . We recently report significant airway obstruction mask leak occur half preterm infant receive PPV DR . In particular , large mask leak observe twice many recording airway obstruction third recording neither obstruction facemask leak occur . In addition , mask leak likely occur start PPV , airway obstruction often occur later . Assessment infant may distract resuscitator focus mask position mask hold technique initial phase PPV . MR SOPA Neonatal Resuscitation Program ( NRP ) emphasize ventilation corrective step ensure effective mask ventilation move next step resuscitation . Technique improve PPV mask perform series corrective step , identify acronym `` MR SOPA '' , recall ventilation corrective step . The step follow order : `` M Mask adjustment , R Reposition airway , S Suction mouth nose , O Open mouth , P Pressure increase , A Airway alternative '' . Hypotheses test We hypothesize improved mask ventilation technique use daily MRSOPA-Drills ( MR SOPA group ) compare standard NRP teaching ( control group ) reduce mask leak preterm infant &lt; 33 week gestation require breathe support birth . We aim determine daily MR SOPA Drills compare standard NRP teach improves mask ventilation . Experimental design method Study population : Infants &lt; 33 week gestation require respiratory support birth include member Resuscitation-Stabilization-Triage team ( RST-team ) enrol study attend delivery . Study design : Randomized controlled trial . Participants : Members RST-team , usually consist neonatal nurse ( n=50 ) , neonatal respiratory therapist ( n=30 ) , neonatal nurse practitioner ( n=16 ) neonatal fellow ( n=6 ) , neonatal consultant ( n=15 ) . Deliveries usually attend minimum three RST-Team member : neonatal nurse , neonatal respiratory therapist neonatal nurse practitioner neonatal fellow . Participants professional group randomize informed consent member professional group stratify group . In addition , state baby health information collect Description intervention timeline Interventions group ( `` MR SOPA group '' `` control group '' ) Baseline ( 2 month ) Over period two month participant record several real-life resuscitation use unique record system ( include respiratory function monitor video recording ) establish baseline mask PPV performance . Intervention period `` MR SOPA group '' Health care provider randomize `` MR SOPA '' group receive MR SOPA training provide qualified educator every shift . This training five minute long consist MR SOPA step . These corrective step demonstrate practiced low-fidelity neonatal mannequin DR Royal Alexandra Hospital . The mannequin place DR resuscitation unit simulate real-life scenario . The alternative airway practice perform intubation mannequin DR also place DR resuscitation unit . Each participant receive five minute train start shift . The educator teach mask adjustment , airway reposition . If either first step unsuccessful participant learn mouth nose suction , open mouth increase airway pressure . All participant also learn practice alternative airway placement include intubation laryngeal mask airway placement . `` Control group '' Health care provider randomize control group receive copy NRP text page discuss MR SOPA every shift self-study . They encourage educator study page five minute every shift . The educator answer question arise . After trial period ( 2 month ) After recruit training study participant intervention period real life resuscitation record similarly pre-trial period next two month , use unique record system . This period compare baseline measure pre-trial period . Resuscitation All resuscitative measure decide RST-team , accordance 2010 guideline neonatal resuscitation . Equipment record resuscitation We use routinely used equipment record neonatal resuscitation include user-friendly respiratory function monitor measure respiratory parameter include tidal volume , airway pressure , gas flow , minute ventilation , exhale CO2 . Percutaneous oxygen saturation assess use pulse oximetery systemic regional hemodynamic function assess use heart rate , blood pressure . A high-definition digital video resuscitation make use webcam .</detailed_description>
