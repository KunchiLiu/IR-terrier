	<brief_summary>The Pulmonary Embolism Rule Out Criteria ( PERC ) 8-item rule , derive tested rule diagnosis Pulmonary Embolism ( PE ) Emergency Department ( ED ) amongst low risk patient . Even though meta analysis confirm safety utilization , equipoise remain - especially European country prevalence PE high US- whether rule could safely apply low risk emergency patient suspicion PE . The PROPER Trial non inferiority , cluster randomize trial . All center recruit patient suspicion PE low pre test probability . To rule diagnosis PE , center use usual diagnostic strategy D-dimeres measurement 6 month , PERC base strategy 6 month . In control group ( usual strategy ) , patient test D-dimeres , follow positive Computed Tomography Pulmonary Artery ( CTPA ) . In intervention group ( PERC Based ) , patient first assess PERC score . If PERC=0 , diagnosis PE exclude supplemental investigation . If PERC &gt; 0 , patient undergo usual strategy , D-dimeres measurement +/- CTPA . The primary outcome failure percentage diagnostic strategy , define diagnosed deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) PE 3 month follow , among patient PE initially rule .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The diagnosis Pulmonary Embolism ( PE ) Emergency Department ( ED ) crucial . As emergency physician fear miss potential lethal condition , PE tend overdiagnosed potential source unnecessary risk clear benefit term outcome . PERC 8-item block clinical criterion identify patient safely discharge without investigation ED diagnosis PE . The endorsement rule could markedly reduce number irradiative imaging study , length stay ED , rate adverse event result diagnostic therapeutic mean . Several retrospective prospective study show safety benefit PERC rule PE diagnosis low risk patient . However , randomize study yet compare benefit/risk ratio PERC base strategy standard diagnosis strategy thus validate endorsement set . We hypothesize patient low gestalt clinical probability PERC negative , PE safely rule patient discharge test This control , cluster randomize trial Europe ( N=15 ) . Each center randomize sequence period intervention : 6 month intervention ( PERC base strategy ) follow 6 month control ( usual care ) , 6 month control follow 6 month intervention 2 month `` wash-out '' two period . The primary objective study ass non inferiority PERC base diagnosis strategy PE low risk emergency patient , compare standard strategy D-dimer testing , occurrence non-diagnosed thrombo-embolic event . The primary outcome failure percentage diagnostic strategy , define diagnose DVT PE 3 month follow , among patient PE initially rule . Exclusion PE ED make upon negative D-dimere result negative CTPA group , negative PERC intervention group . Secondary objective : To assess reduction unnecessary irradiative imaging study adverse event . To assess reduction ED length stay , undue onset anticoagulation regimen associate adverse event . To assess reduction hospital admission , readmission , mortality 3 month . Secondary endpoint include : - Rate CTPA related adverse event - Length stay ED ( hour ) - Anticoagulant therapy administration adverse event - Admission hospital follow ED visit . - All cause hospitalization 3 month , - Death cause 3 month The two group different work diagnosis PE ED follow : Experimental group : PERC base strategy : work diagnosis PE include calculation PERC . If PERC criterion negative , test PE recommend . If least one criterion positive , patient undergoes sensitive D-dimer testing , subsequent CTPA positive . In case negative D-dimer result , PE exclude . Control group : Standard strategy : conventional work diagnosis PE . Every low risk patient undergo sensitive D-dimer testing , subsequent CTPA positive . In case negative D-dimer , PE exclude . All patient chest pain dyspnea screen included ED emergency physician research assistant . If treating emergency physician local investigator considers patient sufficient clinical suspicion PE need formal work diagnosis , suspicion low enough discard suspicion case negative D-dimer , patient eligble ask write informed consent . When recruit patient , emergency physician local investigator confirm write answered `` yes '' two follow sentence : This patient clinical suspicion Pulmonary Embolism , diagnosis need formally rule confirmed discharge I estimate empirical clinical probability Pulmonary Embolism low After write informed consent obtain , patient include study . Included patient follow phone interview hospital visit three month ( 13 week ) clinical research technician . The time frame three month could subject minor adjustement , occur day 84 day 98 . Follow visit interview seek occurrence thrombo-embolic event ( DVT document ultrasonography low limbs venous CT , PE document positive CTPA high probability V/Q lung scan ) , death , return visit ED , hospitalisation . All medical record pertaining patient timeframe seek analysed local investigator , find report thrombo-embolic event , adverse event CTPA anticaogulation . In case death , report thrombo-embolic event , file analyse comitee three independent expert . This method adjudication describe validated major previous diagnostic study PE .</detailed_description>
