	<brief_summary>This proposal aim evaluate selective laser trabeculoplasty ( SLT ) safe effective therapy control open-angle glaucoma reduce risk progression visual dysfunction blindness African-derived develop world . If fund , work complete characterization SLT 's safety efficacy profile mean long-term disease control population . This work support translation SLT structure public health initiative reduce glaucoma-related vision loss throughout African-derived develop world .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glaucoma Management African-Derived Developing World Using Trabeculoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma lead cause blindness African-derived developing world represent significant public health challenge disease burden substantial . In Ghana , prevalence open-angle glaucoma age 40 8.5 % . In Barbados , prevalence 7.0 % . In neighboring St. Lucia , prevalence estimate 8.8 % 16 % ten-year incidence glaucoma-related blindness one eye . ( In contrast , prevalence US adults 1.9 % . ) The burden glaucoma-related visual dysfunction also substantial develop world . Because application medical surgical therapy limit issue cost , availability , limited regional surgical expertise , undertreatment pervasive . Also , little access low vision vision rehabilitation service minimal social support visually impair . Laser trabeculoplasty may part solution develop world 's burgeon glaucoma burden . The treatment fast , safe , minimally invasive require minimal post-treatment care ; equipment portable ; incremental cost trabeculoplasty treatment small equipment expertise on-site . Our recent study St. Lucia demonstrate laser trabeculoplasty lower IOP amount likely favorably alter clinical course glaucoma ( versus treatment ) potential bend glaucoma-related blindness curve African-derived developing world . Our long-term goal translate find public health initiative establish pan-Caribbean glaucoma laser program provide safe , effective , cost-effective therapy glaucoma underserved overburdened region . Before happen , several important research question remain unanswered regard SLT population comprise specific aim proposal . What long-term efficacy SLT population ? Is repeat SLT effective IOP reduction initial SLT wane ? Are result obtained St. Lucia generalizable develop nation populate people African descent ? In application , propose prospective cohort study St. Lucia qualify subject open-angle glaucoma receive bilateral selective laser trabeculoplasty , follow failure initial SLT , undergo repeat SLT follow failure . The long-term safety efficacy initial repeat SLT glaucoma patient African descent thus establish . Further , replicate cohort study Dominica confirm external validity St. Lucia outcomes . This proposal design answer question pose thus complete research phase project facilitate translation research find public health space . Considering population African-derived developing world , prevalence glaucoma population , observe preliminary benefit laser therapy , project 's output could ultimately reduce risk glaucoma-related visual dysfunction hundred thousand individual throughout develop world .</detailed_description>
