	<brief_summary>This study randomise placebo control trial examine effectiveness use intranasal cool device ( RhinoChill ) provide relief pain symptom acute migraine . It involve use two nasal catheter cool nasal cavity provide localised cool local nasal tissue blood vessel supply blood brain . This cool effect cause blood vessel constrict well stimulate special cold receptor think involved relief migraine , thereby provide pain associate symptomatic relief . Ninety patient randomise 1:1 fashion , cluster three different recruitment site . The patient 30 day period data collection current migraine frequency , treatment response medication ( minimum 2 migraine attack record ) start treatment phase RhinoChill Device . Treatment 2 migraine attack . Only single treatment allow first attack , second attack patient may deliver 2 treatment gap least 2 hour treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study multi centre , double blind , randomize , prospective , parallel placebo control trial demonstrating effectiveness RhinoChill System symptomatic relief migraine headache . The specific study design consist : - Participant identification neurology clinic record gain initial consent transfer contact detail trial team . - Telephone contact direct clinic contact potential participant describe COOLHEAD 2 trial seek expression interest . - Initial meeting potential participant discussion trial , provision patient information leaflet . Informed Consent take . - Initial 30 day prospective data collection period ( minimum 2 migraine attack , long period need ) - Randomisation either placebo active RhinoChill - Device Delivery training session use RhinoChill device , self administration , record keep . - Treatment period treatment 2 separate migraine RhinoChill . During initial screen visit phonecall , trial discuss potential participant inclusion/exclusion checklist complete . If patient meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion , ask permission pas contact detail member trial team contact . Arrangements make meet patient either clinic home discus trial consider enrol study . At time , provide patient information sheet show RhinoChill device . The patient give opportunity fully consider aspect participation trial discus family member wish consent trial member study team . At time consent , researcher also collect data baseline CRF provide initial instruction completion first stage data collection form ( describe ) At baseline visit , patient first give opportunity ask question may research . A member research team take informed consent gain signature consent form . Baseline data collect , include history migraine headache , frequency , severity symptom , medication therapy currently ongoing take past . Base line vital sign also record time . Once complete , short training session completion prospective data collection form phase 1 trial give use supply blood pressure machine pulse oxymeter machine . Once baseline visit complete patient begin 30 day period self data collection base migraine experience time frame use data capture form provide research nurse ( minimum 2 migraine attack require , therefore 2 occur 30 day , time give allow second migraine occur ) . If patient single migraine first 30 day , able continue treatment phase meet inclusion criterion least 1 migraine per month . Following conclusion initial period , treatment phase begin . After end prospective data collection period , patient randomise either active treatment placebo treatment . Randomisation provide sealed envelope hold E &amp; E CRO service ( Vienna ) also act independent monitor trial . Randomisation perform via online system www.sealedenvelope.com . Training undertaken ensure patient fully competent safe use RhinoChill intranasal cool device . The patient instruct : - Preparation device - Insertion nasal catheter - Selecting correct flow rate - Positioning treatment - Cleaning storage nasal catheter - Trial documentation - 24 hour contact number additional supply , troubleshoot practical support . The patient also leave reference booklet issue around trial practical use RhinoChill device . At onset migraine headache ( soon possible thereafter ) , patient start complete 'Treatment ' CRF . Each step treatment procedure complete order describe patient . Patients instruct scope alteration treatment order requirement trial unless safety issue become evident . If patient deviate standard procedure outline , require contact 24 hour COOLHEAD 2 mobile phone report incident review log protocol deviation review site/principal investigator early opportunity . The RhinoChill device prepare use treatment administer . The RhinoChill Migraine Intranasal catheter insert 10 minute treatment commence Low Flow . follow steps individual treatment : It recognise participant study already take medication migraine headache . Normal prophylaxis allow part trial record initial screening interview . No change prophylaxis allow within three month start trial patient participate trial . However , acute treatment triptans allow take must withhold least two hour follow completion treatment RhinoChill allow assessment intervention . Any rescue medication take point record associate trial documentation . A full medication history along therapy ( include alternative therapy ) also record . No new treatment therapy start participant enrol trial .</detailed_description>
