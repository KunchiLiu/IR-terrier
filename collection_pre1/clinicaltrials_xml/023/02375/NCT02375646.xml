	<brief_summary>One well-known complication post colonic polypectomy bleed usually occur 2-week period follow procedure . Patients treat oral anticoagulation ( e.g . Warfarin ) special challenging patient group due need one hand prevent thromboembolic event , second hand minimize risk post-polypectomy bleeding . Current practice guideline recommend hold Warfarin treatment bridge LMW Heparin resume Warfarin treatment follow procedure . This practice find associated much high rate bleeding compare continue Warfarin recent prospective trial pacemaker transplant patient . The fact post-polypectomy bleeding occurs within 2-week period question current practice periprocedural bridging therapy . investigator therefore hypothesize patient continuous Warfarin treatment may similar post-polypectomy bleeding rate compare patient receive bridge therapy LMW Heparin . This multicenter single-blinded prospective randomize trial compare small post-polypectomy ( polyps &lt; 10mm ) bleed rate two group patient : Continuous therapy Warfarin , vs. LMW Heparin therapy withhold Warfarin therapy ( current practice ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oral anti thrombotic medication commonly prescribe patient venous thromboembolism , chronic atrial fibrillation , prosthetic heart valve , etc . As gastrointestinal endoscopy often required patient , one consider urgency procedure , risk bleeding ( related antithrombotic therapy type endoscopic procedure ) risk thromboembolic event related interruption antithrombotic therapy.Current ASGE guideline state aspirin may continue diagnostic therapeutic endoscopic procedure . As oral anticoagulant ( ie . warfarin ) , distinction make risk thromboembolism ( high vs. low patient risk thrombosis ) risk bleeding ( high vs. low procedure risk bleed ) . ASGE ACCP Guidelines suggest discontinue anticoagulation periendoscopic period patient low risk thromboembolic event ( appendix I ) , continue anticoagulation patient high risk thromboembolic event . Switching LMWH , term `` bridge therapy '' , suggest anticoagulation need continue . However little evidence support approach . In addition , number potential drawback bridge therapy heparin periprocedural period . This approach consume considerable healthcare resource , involve short period normal coagulability ( hypercoagulability ) associate risk thromboembolism . Finally , In recent systematic review 34 study anticoagulated patient ( 19 enrol endoscopic procedure ) , bridge therapy find associate increased rate overall major bleeding , difference thrombotic event , compare bridging . Colonic polypectomy consider procedure high risk bleeding . The report risk polypectomy related bleeding range various report low 0.3 % high 6.1 % , average study 1-2.5 % Bleeding immediate delayed , latter bit frequent , occur 2 % patient , early hour late 29 day procedure , though mostly post procedure day . Polyp size great 1-2 cm find associate increased risk immediate delay postpolypectomy bleed . As example , bleed occur ~1 % polypectomy &lt; 1 cm 6.5 % polypectomy &gt; 2 cm.Other factor find related bleeding risk age , location ( Cecal right colon &gt; rest colon ) , cardiovascular renal comorbidities , use anticoagulation . The continuation anticoagulation increase bleed risk . In 2004 retrospective study 1657 patient undergo polypectomy , post procedural bleeding rate 2.2 % ( 86 % immediate , 14 % delay ) , Warfarin find associate Odds ratio 13.37 bleeding . In contrast study , age , size location polyp find associate risk bleed . On hand , temporary suspension anticoagulation therapy associate , least theoretically , risk thromboembolic complication . The magnitude risk report low ( ~ 0.7 % ) 2 retrospective study one meta-analysis admittedly high risk patient underrepresented . In fact , actual overall rate ( without bridge ) perioperative thrombotic complication high range 0.9-1.8 % , correspond bleed rate 1.9 % -2.7 % .As bridging therapy , evidence come almost exclusively retrospective study . Recent meta-analysis show , compare anticoagulation , perioperative bridging therapy heparin increase overall risk major bleed without significant decrease risk thromboembolic event . Later , prospective , randomize study compare bridge therapy continue warfarin patient moderate-to-high risk thromboembolism undergo defibrillator pacemaker surgery ( high bleeding risk procedure definition ) , find major bleed bridge group compare continue warfarin , difference thrombotic outcome.Apart mention paper , far investigator know , comparative prospective study compare bridge continued warfarin . Polyps 1 cm diameter safely remove patient warfarin therapy . In one retrospective series , warfarin discontinue 36 hour prior colonoscopy avoid supra therapeutic INR . 3 123 patient underwent 225 polypectomy warfarin bleeding , one require treatment . All patient prophylactically treat clips.19 In recent randomized trial , 70 patient total 159 polyp 1 cm diameter underwent polypectomy take warfarin . Patients assign polyp remove either eith cold snare technique electrocautery . Immediate bleeding occur 10 70 patient ( 14 % ) common patient polyps remove use electrocautery ( 23 % vs 6 % ) . No delayed bleeding occur cold group whereas 5 ( 14 % ) patient require endoscopic hemostasis electrocautery group . As immediate bleeding effectively manage endoscopically , investigator question potential benefit periprocedural bridging term prevent delay bleeding ( occur warfarin-LMWH overlap follow warfarin re-loading ) . Considering fact ~ 25 % patient find colorectal polyp screen colonoscopy , majority polyp &lt; 20 mm , A cardinal question whether investigator keep choose among two traditional policy : advise patient stop warfarin ahead screen colonoscopy , Or keep anticoagulated reschedule therapeutic colonoscopy face discover colonic polyp ( approach find cost effective one study compare two policy ) . The investigator think third option might better : keep patient anticoagulated warfarin , perform polypectomy polyps 20 mm , re-scheduling patient large polyp . To summarize , three important conclusion data present introduction : 1 . Small polyp show safely remove Warfarin 2 . Delayed bleeding occur bridge finish 3 . Bridging therapy probably relate increased bleeding , theoretically relate increase thromboembolic risk logistically complex Taken together , background data underlies logic perform prospective study compare bleed rate follow polypectomy small polyp orally anticoagulated vs. bridge patient . Hypothesis : In patient moderate high risk thromboembolic event undergo elective colonoscopy , strategy uninterrupted oral anticoagulation lead equivalent bleed rate compare conventional bridging anticoagulation . Study Objectives : Primary study Objective : evaluate safety polypectomy Warfarin therapy compare currently recommend bridging therapy heparin LMWH Study Design : Following signing informed consent , patient chronic Warfarin therapy meeting inclusion exclusion criterion , schedule elective diagnostic colonoscopy randomly assign one two group , first continue Warfarin treatment usual second switch bridge therapy LMWH accord recommendation ACCP guideline . INR check day colonoscopy ( day -1 ) group . Most recent CBC value ( recent 3 month ) serve baseline value . If available - CBC do recruitment period . On day colonoscopy ( day 0 ) , patient INR value within therapeutic range supratherapeutic value 0.5 unit proceed colonoscopy . In case INR value day -1 available , patient ambulatory INR value last three month review patient enrol &gt; =80 % value within therapeutic window . The warfarin dose day 0 take follow supervision period colonoscopy . In case INR 0.5 therapeutic range day -1 , therapy resume day1 . As colonoscopy , group schedule early morning monitor clinical follow 6 hour Endoscopy unit . Polyps 10 mm ( estimate use open-forceps technique , forceps span=8mm ) remove cold hot method ( accord physician preference ) . Hemostatic clip apply deem necessary accord perform physician judgement . In case multiple polyp , number polypectomy do determined endoscopist . For polyps measure &gt; 10 mm , colonoscopy reschedule ( small polyp still remove index colonoscopy ) .Following procedure , patient monitor 6 hour Endoscopy unit . Delayed bleeding monitored patient daily follow sheet . Ambulatory CBC do week follow colonoscopy . Investigators make Phone call follow day 5,10,14,30 . Outpatient clinic follow take place day 30 Â± 7 days.Patients instruct contact investigate physician case black stool BRBPR otherwise come ER case continuous bleed bleed perceive significant patient family . Study Procedures : Recruitment visit GI institute outpatient clinic perform least 1 week ahead Colonoscopy ; Patient 's primary care physician contact study coordinator upon sign informed consent , order perform necessary blood test procedure . ; colonoscopy ( day 0 ) ; Follow period 14 day via phone call patient sheet ; Clinical follow visit day 30 Sample Size : The bleed rate post polypectomy orally anticoagulated patient undergoing polypectomy small polyp Warfarin report low 1 % recent trial ( see background ) . The rate postpolypectomy bleed general population 1-2.5 % . As bridge found increase bleeding compare bridge large available meta-analysis , investigator assume bleed rate 4 % bridge group . The sample size estimate base complicate rate delay bleed within 2 week polypectomy base detect equivalence proportion 5 % level significance power 80 % , yield sample size 286 ( 143 group ) . Statistical Analysis : Descriptive statistic include 95 % CIs calculate baseline variable use mean , median , SDs interquartile range continuous variable rate proportion discrete variable treatment arm . For primary outcome , clinically significant bleeding , treatment arm compare use chi-square test . Baseline characteristic compare , clinically significant difference identify , logistic regression analysis conduct compare clinically significant bleed two treatment arm adjust difference . Same analysis follow secondary outcome . Ethical issue : The investigator ensure study conduct accordance principle `` Declaration Helsinki '' guideline law regulation state Israel . Written informed consent must obtain prior participation study .</detailed_description>
