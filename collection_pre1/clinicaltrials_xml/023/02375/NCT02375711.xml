	<detailed_description>The risk infection hepatitis B exposure blood high ( 30 % 1.8 % Hepatitis C Virus HIV 1 % ) dialysis patient population risk . Vaccination virus , effective general population ( vaccine response : 90 95 % ) , highly recommended dialysis patient . However , numerous study show HBV vaccination less effective patient chronic renal disease general population . The reason low vaccine response poorly understood . However , recent data suggest renal failure could induce accelerated immunosenescence . The age immune system , immunosenescence , complex profound phenomenon immune system life . The gradual reduction generation naive T cell thymus major cause immunosenescence . But process also associate accumulation lymphocytes end differentiation . In context , decrease vaccine response increase infection renal insufficiency might correlate , elderly population , age immune system . The aim study investigate role immunosenescence HBV vaccination response patient renal insufficiency . Vaccination HBV perform purpose study , due exist vaccine indication subject . Included patient receive vaccination routine care accord recommendation vaccination schedule recommend Health Authority .</detailed_description>
