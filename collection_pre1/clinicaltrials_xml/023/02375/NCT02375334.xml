	<brief_title>Adherence Monitoring System Managing Myelosuppression Patients With Newly Diagnosed Malignant Gliomas Receiving Temozolomide Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To develop adherence monitoring system within Epic functionally equivalent previously design validated system Cancer Center Oncology Research Information System ( ORIS ) patient newly diagnose malignant glioma receive concurrent temozolomide radiation therapy . II . To test newly design Epic system compare frequency timing flag ( laboratory date flag , visit date flag in-patient status flag ) non-adherent day generate frequency timing generate ORIS patient newly diagnose malignant glioma receive concurrent temozolomide radiation therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To develop system may easily adapt future therapy require compliance monitoring . OUTLINE : Patient lab visit date monitor Cancer Center ORIS EPIC base system 42 day concurrent temozolomide radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
