	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study well standard-dose combination chemotherapy work compare high-dose combination chemotherapy stem cell transplant treat patient germ cell tumor return period improvement respond treatment . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , ifosfamide , cisplatin , carboplatin , etoposide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving chemotherapy stem cell transplant stop growth cancer cell stop divide kill . Giving colony-stimulating factor , filgrastim pegfilgrastim , certain chemotherapy drug , help stem cell move bone marrow blood collect store . Chemotherapy give prepare bone marrow stem cell transplant . The stem cell return patient replace blood-forming cell destroy chemotherapy . It yet know whether high-dose combination chemotherapy stem cell transplant effective standard-dose combination chemotherapy treat patient refractory relapse germ cell tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study international collaboration European sit . Collaborators study include National Cancer Institute , European Organization Research Treatment Cancer Movember Foundation . Randomization stratify region ( North America Europe ) modify IPFSG ( International Prognostic Factor Study Group ) risk classification ( low , intermediate high ) . The primary secondary objective describe . Primary Objective : 1 . To compare overall survival patient treat conventional-dose chemotherapy use TIP regimen high-dose chemotherapy ( HDCT ) plus autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) use TI-CE regimen initial salvage treatment patient relapse refractory germ cell tumor ( GCT ) Secondary Objectives : 1 . To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient treat initial salvage HDCT TI-CE versus initial salvage CDCT TIP 2 . To compare favorable response rate ( FRR ) patient treat initial salvage HDCT TI-CE versus initial salvage CDCT TIP 3 . To compare toxicity , include treatment-related mortality , associate high-dose chemotherapy ASCT use TI-CE compare conventional-dose chemotherapy use TIP initial salvage treatment patient relapse refractory GCT 4 . To prospectively evaluate IPFSG score system predictor outcome initial salvage therapy patient relapse refractory GCT . In trial , randomization stratify modification IPFSG category prospectively evaluate whether actual outcome vary risk group appropriate manner ( low risk patient higher OS high-risk group ) . 5 . To evaluate association tumor marker decline rate Alpha-Fetoprotein ( AFP ) Human Chorionic Gonadotropin ( HCG ) OS PFS . Treatment continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity completion protocol treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Documentation Disease Histologic Documentation : Confirmation GCT histology ( seminoma nonseminoma ) pathologic review center enrollment . Tumor may originate primary site . NOTE : In rare circumstance , patient allow enroll even pathologic diagnosis may establish . This would require clinical situation consistent diagnosis GCT ( testicular , peritoneal , retroperitoneal mediastinal mass , elevate tumor marker level { HCG ≥ 500 ; AFP ≥ 500 } typical pattern metastasis ) 2 . Evidence Disease Must evidence progressive recurrent GCT ( measurable nonmeasurable ) follow one line cisplatinbased chemotherapy , define meeting least one follow criterion : Tumor biopsy new grow unresectable lesion demonstrate viable nonteratomatous GCT ( enrollment study adjuvant treatment macroscopically complete resection viable GCT allow ) . In event incomplete gross resection viable GCT find , patient consider eligible study . Consecutive elevate serum tumor marker ( HCG AFP ) increase . Increase elevate LDH alone constitute progressive disease . Development new enlarge lesion set persistently elevate HCG AFP , even HCG AFP continue increase . 3 . Prior Treatment Must receive 36 cycle cisplatinbased chemotherapy part firstline ( initial ) chemotherapy . Prior POMBACE , CBOPBEP , GAMEC allow . Note : For patient require immediate treatment , 1 cycle conventionaldose salvage chemotherapy allow . Therefore , patient may receive 7 prior cycle chemotherapy . 6 cycle part firstline chemotherapy 1 cycle salvage conventional chemotherapy . No one prior line chemotherapy GCT ( 1 cycle salvage chemotherapy define protocol ) Definition one line chemotherapy : One line therapy case consist 2 different cisplatinbased treatment combination , provide disease progression two regimen . Prior treatment carboplatin adjuvant therapy allow , provide patient meet eligibility criterion ( e.g. , patient also receive 34 cycle cisplatinbased chemotherapy ) . Prior treatment 12 cycle BEP EP adjuvant chemotherapy early stage GCT allow , provide patient also receive 34 cycle BEP EP relapse . Patients treat 34 cycle VIP relapse follow 12 cycle BEP/EP eligible would consider 1 line prior therapy . No prior treatment highdose chemotherapy ( define treatment utilize stem cell rescue ) No prior treatment TIP exception give bridge treatment protocol patient rapidly progressive disease wait complete eligibility screen process . Only one cycle allow . No concurrent treatment cytotoxic drug target therapy . No radiation therapy ( brain ) within 14 day day 1 protocol chemotherapy except radiation brain metastasis , must complete 7 day prior start chemotherapy . No previous chemotherapy within 17 day prior enrollment . A minimum three week last day start previous chemotherapy regimen first day chemotherapy study protocol . Must adequate recovery prior surgery ( eg , heal scar , resumption diet ) 4 . Age ≥ 14 year ( ≥ 18 year Germany ) 5 . ECOG Performance Status 0 2 6 . Male gender 7 . Required Initial Laboratory Values : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500/mm^3 Platelet Count ≥ 100,000/mm^3 Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) 8 . No concurrent malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer , superficial noninvasive ( pTa pTis ) TCC bladder , contralateral GCT , intratubular germ cell neoplasia . Patients prior malignancy , least 2 year since evidence disease allow . 9 . Negative Serology ( antibody test ) follow infectious disease : Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) type 1 2 Human Tcell Leukemia Virus ( HTLV ) type 1 2 ( mandatory US optional Canada Europe ) Hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C antibody 10 . No late relapse completely surgically resectable disease . Patients late relapse ( define relapse ≥ 2 year date completion last chemotherapy regimen ) whose disease completely surgically resectable eligible . Patients late relapse unresectable disease eligible . 11 . No large ( ≥ 2 cm ) hemorrhagic symptomatic brain metastasis local treatment administer ( radiation therapy surgery ) . Treatment may begin ≥ 7 day completion local treatment . Patients small ( &lt; 2 cm ) asymptomatic brain metastasis allow may treat radiation therapy and/or surgery concurrently Arm A cycle 1 2 Arm B deem medically indicate . Radiation therapy give concurrently highdose carboplatin etoposide . 12 . No secondary somatic malignancy arise teratoma ( e.g. , teratoma malignant transformation ) actively part disease recurrence progression .</criteria>
