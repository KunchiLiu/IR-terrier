	<brief_summary>The aim study assess nutritional intake ( quantitatively qualitatively ) , nutritional state body composition patient suffer mitochondrial cytopathy , compare healthy control . The energy intake calculate dietary protocol , energy expenditure indirect calorimetry body composition perform bio-impedance analysis . Further , investigator expect able provide nutritional counsel population order increase energy protein intake , may improve health well-being .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nutritional Assessment Mitochondrial Cytopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Mitochondrial diseases group genetic disorder . The prognosis patient mitochondrial myopathy varies greatly , depend largely type disease degree involvement various organ . This situation lead malnutrition bad outcome . In literature data , deal malnutrition nutritional intake patient mitochondrial myopathy . Sorensen et al . assess malnutrition risk European hospital show 45 % patient neurological illness ( neurological vascular disease exclude ) high risk malnutrition . Furthermore , patient risk exhibit high rate complication mortality . These finding suggest malnutrition play important role clinical outcome patient 's population , reflect investigator ' many year experience . In several case report , show malnutrition could aggravate myopathy . Sometimes challenge symptom face patient mitochondrial myopathy interfere obtain balance healthy nutrition , fatigue , muscle weakness , dysmotility , dysphagia , nausea vomiting , ataxia , reflux . In addition , investigator ' clinical experience , see many patient describe specific food intake would even modify symptom . This observational cohort study , investigator expect total sample size 30 patient 20 healthy age- sex-matched control . The entire study conduct period first October 2014 till End March 2015 . The investigator pharmacy student ( master level ) interested clinical nutrition . She collect data und measurement along support clinical nutrition research team University Hospital Bern . The investigator contact patient individually arrange suitable timetable interview examination . Sex , age , current medical condition , current myopathy symptom , current gastrointestinal symptom , unintentional weight loss , eat drinking habit , live social situation , daily activity , medication ( particular drug interfere mitochondrial metabolism valproic acid , statin , certain antibiotic like aminoglycosides , etc . ) smoking , alcohol intake , main diagnosis record . The investigator preform follow measurement : basic demographic data , structure patient interview , dietary questionnaire , nutritional risk screening , quality life , physical functioning , body composition , energy expenditure , blood urine analysis . The study conduct accordance ethical guideline 1957 Declaration Helsinki , inform consent obtain participant . The healthy volunteer patient expose risk due study . Objective The aim study assess nutritional intake nutritional state patient mitochondrial myopathy compare healthy control . The investigator expect able provide general nutritional advice ( nutritional counselling ) increase ingestion balanced/healthy food energy intake , therefore expect improve health well-being population . Methods Questionnaire , indirect calorimetry , bioimpedance analysis BIA , Hand grip test , Anthropometrics 7-days food recall protocol</detailed_description>
