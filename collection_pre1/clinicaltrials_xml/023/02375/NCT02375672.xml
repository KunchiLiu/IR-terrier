	<brief_title>Study Pembrolizumab Combination With Chemotherapy Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : mFOLFOX6 Treatment D1 D15 ( Cycle = 28 day ) - Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV - Leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV follow - 5FU 400 mg/m2 bolus 2400 mg/m2 via continuous infusion Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) IV 30 minute every 3 week SAFETY RUN-IN COHORT : The safety run-in cohort include 6 subject treat 200 mg ( fix ) IV infusion pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) every 3 week plus standard-dose mFOLFOX6 give every 2 week . These first 6 subject follow 4 week dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) enrol additional 24 patient . If DLT observe 1 6 subject , trial continue enrol subject remainder phase II portion study . Otherwise , 6 additional subject enrol dose level -1 . If one DLT observe , phase II enroll subject dose level -1 total expect number accrual . Disease evaluation every 8 week every 2 cycle Demonstrate adequate organ function define follow laboratory value study entry . All screen lab perform within 14 day prior registration protocol therapy . Hematopoietic : - Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ( transfusion acceptable ) - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L - Platelets ≥ 100 × 10^9/L Renal : - Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) , measure calculated creatinine clearance ( estimate Cockcroft-Gault formula measure ) ≥ 50 mL/min Hepatic : - Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN - Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST , SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT , SGPT ) ≤ 3 × ULN , unless evidence liver metastasis , AST/ALT ≤ 5 x ULN</detailed_description>
