	<brief_summary>Swelling common problem knee arthroplasty often leading delay wound healing , last functional impairment hematoma . Due complication , sometimes risk deep venous thrombosis raise . This study investigate new self adjustable device reduce swell effective postoperatively .

	<detailed_description>Purpose Pain , swell inflammation expect early recovery total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . Compression therapy frequently use modality direct post operative treatment , great variety use material , way time frame application . The common goal compression therapy prevention reduction swell . At time literature consistent use effect compression therapy prevention trombo-embolic process The state art care concepts patient undergo total knee arthroplasty embrace concept `` fast track '' ( Kehlet et al ) important part early mobilisation optimal analgesic . In investigator hospital concept already implement . During stay hospital challenge give adequate compression therapy prevent reduce swell enhance woundhealing . At time essential optimise ambulation patient possibility exercise . The current protocol investigator hospital consist 24 hour compression therapy `` Elastomull Haft 速 '' , elastic bandage knee region , combine Comprinet stock ( BSM Medical速 ) anti thrombotic purposis . The anti thrombosis stock worn period 6 week . The compression combine use Continious Passive Motion device 4 hour post operatively ( 2 hour immobilisation position 90 degree flexion , follow 2 hour hour passive motion range 60-90 degree flexion ) . Four hour post operatively patient ambulatend physical therapy start . The investigator wonder optimal way post-operative care . Swelling knee whole leg remain problem first 6 week recovery inhibit rehabilitation . Sometimes delayed woundhealing occur patient may complain durable pain make analgesic necessary . Prolonging adequate compression could improve post-operative course support total rehabilitation process . The `` Juxta Reduction Kit ( Medi ) 速 '' , apply knee could adequate solution replace current protocol compression therapy . The `` Juxta Reduction Kit 速 '' non-elastic compression device tailor ( cut correct size ) circumference leg prior operation . Direct post operatively compression device adjust staff follow day patient enable adjust device use Velcro tie loosen fasten . The device suitable early mobilisation give patient tool selfmanagement compression use Velcro flap . The material ` restrict range motion possibility ambulate exercise advise fast track concept optimise . In study patient use compression device period six week combination anti thrombosis stocking ( Struva class 2 ) Outcome parameter measure scheduled way , describe scheme 1 .</detailed_description>
