	<brief_title>Improving Outcomes Cancer Patients Oral Anti-Cancer Medications Using Multi-modal Mobile Health Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The widespread increasing use oral anti-cancer medication ( OAMs ) usher rapidly increase understand cancer pathophysiology . Furthermore , OAMs ' popular ease administration potential cost saving highlight central position healthcare system whole . Importantly , fact heighten appreciation unique challenge associate OAMs use , especially relation prescribing , dispense , reimbursement , education , adherence , comprehensive quality safety assurance . In regard , investigator goal improve medication adherence clinical outcome cancer patient use OAMs mobile-enabled , multi-modal self-management educational intervention . The intervention seek enable patient ' self-efficacy adhere medication direct education coaching , anticipation symptom associated adverse event , close monitoring accurate assessment self-reported outcome . This innovative approach necessarily include personalize feedback management base patient ' treatment regimen , baseline knowledge elucidate barrier adherence , hold great promise improve overall adherence , safety , clinical outcome patient . The investigator hypothesize cancer patient OAMs use mobile-based , multi-modal health self-management ( M health ) intervention design extensive patient education symptom management well connect care team develop increased competency self-care primarily increase medication adherence improve secondary outcome measure study compare cancer patient OAMs use mobile-based intervention .</detailed_description>
