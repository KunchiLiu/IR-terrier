	<brief_summary>This pilot study 12 patient ( 6 control , 6 experimental ) test safety efficacy apply autologous , adipose-derived stromal cell ( ASCs ) , uncultured , Stage III IV pressure ulcer . Patients group would undergo minimal risk liposuction procedure withdraw 50-100 cc adipose tissue . The tissue would process extract stromal layer cell contain stem cell . The ASCs would inject fibrin sealant apply wound . Patients would follow 6 week assess wound heal tolerance treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Wound heal Stage III IV pressure ulcer take four six week longer cost upwards $ 40,000 treat . Past study show adipose tissue contains progenitor cell regenerative cell release multiple angiogenic growth factor cytokines include vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( SDF-1 ) . A current literature review reveal research relate use stem cell enhance wound healing , particular ischemic radiation-induced ulcer . However , limited research complete use stem cell ASCs pressure ulcer . The goal heal pressure ulcer faster prevent complication use patient 's natural ASCs .</detailed_description>
