	<brief_summary>This proposal test diagnostic utility fast magnetic resonance ( MR ) young child Traumatic brain Injury ( TBI ) . In child , TBI cause &gt; 2000 death , 35,000 hospitalization 470,000 emergency department visit US year , make leading cause pediatric disability death . Currently 20-50 % child undergo compute tomography ( CT ) scanning , expose harmful radiation , increase lifetime risk cancer . Risks especially increase child neurologic exam less reliable , grow tissue vulnerable radiation , child year accumulate harmful mutation . Fast MR short , motion-tolerant protocol use child shunt hydrocephalus eliminate radiation exposure without need sedation . However , fast MR validate child TBI , critical gap . The investigator measure feasibility diagnostic utility fast MR child &lt; 6 year ( 72 month ) old undergo head CT TBI . The Investigator recruit child head CT order TBI . Consenting subject undergo fast MR shortly CT result compare determine : 1 ) whether fast MR identify traumatic injury identify CT 2 ) whether fast MR without sedation perform quickly successfully .</brief_summary>
