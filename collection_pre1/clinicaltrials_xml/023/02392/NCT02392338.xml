	<brief_title>Hybrid Procedure Patients With Persistent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation highly associate sudden death stroke , require definitive treatment . In Korea , atrial fibrillation common disease predict affect 5 % population 65 year age 10 % 80 year . Totally thoracoscopic ablation adopt perform successfully February 2012 Samsung Medical Center first time Korea . More 120 operation perform date . In Korea , treatment atrial fibrillation still dependent percutaneous RFCA , life-long medication anticoagulation need recurrent atrial fibrillation occur . The investigator expect thoracoscopic ablation alternative overcome limitation . Also , thoracoscopic ablation RFCA recently perform simultaneously stage stage hybrid procedure , result report . In study , investigator therefore comparatively analyze mid-term result ( 1 year ) include electrocardiogram 24 hour Holter monitoring thoracoscopic ablation RFCA perform individually hybrid procedure patient long-lasting persistent atrial fibrillation . Antiarrhythmic medication , discontinuation anticoagulation medication , echocardiographic finding also analyze .</detailed_description>
