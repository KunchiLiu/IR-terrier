	<detailed_description>Falls fall-related injury elderly people common worldwide , age population raise burden cost . Within UK , fall become major government target , responsible increase injury hospital admission elderly people . The fall rate amongst patient haemodialysis ( HD ) much great general population . There many well establish risk factor fall , many commonly present patient HD , include severe loss muscle mass , high level inactivity , co-existing medical condition high number medication . Nonetheless , main cause health complication death Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) due cardiovascular disease . Cardiovascular disease may result suboptimal regulation blood pressure heart rate exercise , dialysis therapy , body transfer , general activity daily live . Associated symptom dizziness , generalise fatigue , muscular weakness , commonly report may predispose patient HD balance deficit fall . Despite evidence high fall rate patient HD grow number elderly patient , fall associate risk factor receive little research attention . The aim study therefore explore relative importance select exercise-modifiable risk factor fall amongst patient HD .</detailed_description>
