	<brief_title>Does Passive Spinal Mobilization Improve Shoulders Strength Healthy Adults ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants without exist neck pain shoulder problem recruit . Subjects screen 2 investigator independently shoulder muscle weakness . Weakness determine strength side one side remarkably weak compare general strength deltoid muscle side suspect involved . Suitable participant undergo shoulder strength test handheld dynamometer . Participants divide intervention group control group randomly . The shoulder strength test second , individual blind assessor . Subjects intervention group receive passive spinal mobilization cervical 4-5 segment involve side ( ) ; control group receive placebo intervention . Each participant test 2 time , immediately C4-5 joint mobilization involve side ( ) .</detailed_description>
