	<brief_summary>The goal Phase I clinical research study find high tolerable dose ONC201 give patient relapse refractory AML , ALL , MDS . The goal Phase II study learn dose ONC201 find Phase I help control disease . The safety study drug study phase study . This first study use ONC201 human . ONC201 early stage development use human . Providing direct medical benefit purpose study . While Phase II look effectiveness study drug , main purpose study learn safety drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , enrol study group base type disease and/or join study . Up 6 group 6 participant enrol Phase I study , 30 participant enrol Phase II . All take part MD Anderson . If enrolled Phase I , dose ONC201 receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level ONC201 . If intolerable side effect see , next group participant receive high dose group . This continue high tolerable dose ONC201 find . The dose receive may low effect disease , high cause bad side effect . If enrol Phase II , receive ONC201 high dose level tolerate participant Phase I portion study . Study Drug Administration : Each study drug cycle 21 day . You take ONC201 capsule mouth Day 1 cycle . You must crush chew capsule dissolve liquid . You give study drug diary write miss dos . You give study drug diary study doctor clinic visit . Your dose may increase decreased side effect , respond study drug , doctor think next high dose level safe . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include vital sign , weight , discussion medication take . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You 1 EKG dose study drug 3 time next 2 hour first dose . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn PK test 5 time next 24 hour dose study drug . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn PD test dose study drug . On Days 2-4 Cycle 1 : - On Day 2 , EKG . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn PK and/or PD testing . On Days 8 15 Cycle 1 : - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You EKG , vital sign , discussion medication take . - On Day 8 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PK PD test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam , include vital sign discussion medication take . - You EKG dose study drug . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PK PD test . - On Cycle 2 , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy PD testing . On Day 21 Cycle 3 , time doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy cytogenetic , biomarker , PD test . Biomarkers find blood/tissue may relate reaction study drug . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : About 1 month last dose study drug : - You physical exam , include vital sign discussion medication take . - You EKG . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PK PD test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check genetic mutation . This investigational study . ONC201 FDA-approved commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work .</detailed_description>
