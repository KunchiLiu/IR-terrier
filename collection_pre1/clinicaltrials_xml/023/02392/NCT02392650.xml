	<brief_summary>Hominids hominins serve remarkable host microbe , co-evolved past 4.5 million year highly plethoric community . Human-associated microorganism ( `` microbiome '' ) present number exceed quantity human cell least 10-fold begin neonatal period . The collective genome ( `` metagenome '' ) exceed human genome term gene content 150-fold . With respect microbiota preterm birth , generally assume majority intrauterine infection originate low genital tract , microbiota ascend otherwise sterile intrauterine environment infect placenta ( preterm birth ) , fetal membrane ( chorioamnionitis ) , umbilical cord ( funisitis ) , fetus ( sepsis ) . However , others recently demonstrate vaginal gut microbiome community distinctly structured pregnancy , placenta fact sterile , rather harbor low-abundance microbiome likely acquire hematogenous transmission oral microbiome . Based prior study preliminary data , central hypothesis distinct largely commensal resident microbiome pregnancy render risk preterm birth . By utilize state-of-the-science technology analysis tool longitudinal case-cohort preterm birth subject , able transform `` discovery base '' metagenomics multi'omics science readily translatable mechanistic study previously unparalleled level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microbiome And Multi'Omics In Preterm Birth : The Bacteria And Birth Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 . Longitudinal maternal ( vaginal , oral , skin , gut ) , fetal ( oral , skin , gut ) placental ( basal plate parenchyma ) 16S-based metagenomic profiling inferred metagenomics reveal distinct microbial community association preterm birth . Methods : We enroll 526 at-risk gravidae yield approximate 135 preterm birth 401 at-risk term control . Starting first/early second trimester , sample multiple body site ( vagina , oral , stool , placenta ) multiple time point ( antenatal delivery ) , isolate microbial DNA , perform 16S-based determination niche-specific microbial community find association preterm birth . With case-cohort longitudinal design , able apply well-developed supervise learn approach reveal taxa contribute risk preterm birth , body sit gestational age predictive preterm birth . Specific Aim 2 . Whole-genome shotgun ( WGS ) metagenomics select subject body sit enable specie identification , generation microbial gene catalogue , metabolic reconstruction determine structure , function diversity preterm birth microbiome . Methods : To probe metabolic functionality describe pathogen-related mechanism , analyze change total gene content use shotgun metagenomics subset sample . We build functional computational pipeline fully characterize targeted subject ' metagenomic signature . Specific Aim 3 . Integrated host genomics , metatranscriptomics metabonomics data reveal molecular mechanism network underlie preterm birth limit subset sample . Methods : We interrogate integrate concomitantly acquire clinical metadata , microbial host gene expression data ( RNA-Seq metatranscriptomics ) , metabonomics profile advanced computational biostatistical approach . We guide choice subject data Aims 1 2 .</detailed_description>
