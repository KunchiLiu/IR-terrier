	<brief_summary>The main objective trial explore biomarkers assess sensitively link asthma phenotype . This would potentially alone addition clinical biofluid marker indicate asthma endotypes link phenotype eosinophilic , neutrophilic , paucigranulocytic phenotype . Further exploratory marker analyse well understanding physiological level proteins marker play role regard disease characterization asthma . As basis development biomarker asthma , The sponsor plan conduct exploratory biomarker trial determine level reference range biomarkers potentially associate asthma phenotype . The trial aim generate panel serum biomarkers evaluate subsequent interventional study . The longitudinal design use ascertain stability test-retest reliability .</brief_summary>
