	<brief_summary>In past decade , massive scale-up insecticide-treated net ( ITN ) indoor residual spraying ( IRS ) , together introduction artemisinin-combination treatment , lead substantial reduction malaria prevalence incidence African highland . However , rise insecticide resistance increase outdoor transmission greatly hamper effectiveness ITN IRS current indoor-based intervention target outdoor-biting mosquito . Therefore , new supplemental intervention tackle outdoor transmission pyrethroid insecticide resistance urgently need .

	<detailed_description>In past decade , massive scale-up insecticide-treated net ( ITNs ) indoor residual spraying ( IRS ) , together use artemisinin combination treatment , lead major change malaria epidemiology vector biology . Along significant reduction overall malaria prevalence incidence , extensive use insecticide create large selection pressure resistance malaria vector population potential outdoor transmission , appear limit success ITNs IRS . Because IRS ITN little impact outdoor rest early biting vector , outdoor transmission represent one important challenge malaria control . Therefore , new intervention augment current public health measure reduce outdoor transmission urgently need . Larval control historically successful widely use mosquito control many part world , except Africa . Factors limit use larvicide include high cost associate frequent habitat re-treatment . Now new US EPA-approved long-lasting formulation , potentially effective 6 month available . The central objective study determine effect long-lasting microbial larviciding incidence clinical malaria reduction transmission intensity . Our hypothesis addition long-lasting microbial larviciding ongoing ITN IRS program lead significant reduction indoor outdoor malaria transmission malaria incidence .</detailed_description>
