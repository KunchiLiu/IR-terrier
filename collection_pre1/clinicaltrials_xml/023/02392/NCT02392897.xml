	<brief_summary>Eating frequency may play independent role appetite regulation , overall caloric consumption measure long-term health disease risk . Some literature recommend frequent eating , pilot data suggest type eat pattern may harmful health since leaf body perpetual fed state increase systemic inflammation . Therefore , investigator conduct clinical trial 50 healthy adult compare low frequency eat pattern high frequency eat pattern relation blood-based marker inflammation , metabolic health appetite . Study result apply recommendation eat frequency context overall healthy diet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proposal investigate whether eat frequency influence health . Evidence-based recommendation lack optimal number daily eating occasion . This important area research past 40 year Americans ' eat habit change three meal day pattern whereby people 6-8 daily eat occasion . Apart potential increase total energy intake , frequent eat leave people constant postprandial state . This constant , modestly elevate glycemia disturb normal glucose-insulin counter-regulatory hormone network balance also disturb downstream cell signal pathway . A constant postprandial state may increase systemic inflammation cause numerous metabolic disturbance . As result , eat frequency ( EF ) may associate risk diet-related chronic disease cardiovascular disease , cancer diabetes , major cause morbidity , mortality health care cost U.S. To well understand phenomena investigator propose randomize , cross-over clinical trial test low-EF eating pattern ( three eat occasions/day ) vs. high-EF eating pattern ( six eat occasions/day ) relation inflammation , adipokine appetite . The investigator hypothesize compare eating three times/day , eat six times/day increase biomarkers systemic inflammation , decrease beneficial adipokine increase biomarkers self-reported measure appetite . The investigator test hypothesis specific aim : 1 ) To test effect low vs. high eating frequency inflammatory biomarkers ( fast high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , Interleukin-6 tumor necrosis factor-α , ) beneficial adipokine ( adiponectin ) ; 2 ) To test effect low vs. high eating frequency appetite [ daily rating perceive appetite serial rating six-hour appetite test session ] biomarkers involve appetite regulation food intake ( leptin , ghrelin , peptide YY , cholecystokinin ) . The investigator enroll n=50 male female normal weight , overweight obese . Participants complete two 3-week long isocaloric intervention period random order [ low EF ( three eat occasions/day ) high EF ( six eat occasions/day ) ] . Participants free-living eating food use study-provided structured meal plan . Study staff provide on-going support instruction maximize adherence protocol . Fasting blood sample collect begin end study phase . The investigator test intervention effect use GEE modification linear regression compare mean biomarker response ( intervention effect ) study phase . On last day intervention period , participant complete 6-hour appetite test session two test meal provide low-EF phase four test meal provide high-EF phase . Serial appetite rating blood collect assess perceive appetite hormone appetite satiety . Results investigation use form guideline eat frequency context overall healthy diet .</detailed_description>
