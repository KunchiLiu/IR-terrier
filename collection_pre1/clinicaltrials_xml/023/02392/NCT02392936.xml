	<brief_summary>There recent increase incidence surgical site infection cardiac surgery hospital , spite specific measure take concern aspect surgical procedure , target good control classically know major risk factor infection , routine procedure involve sternotomy coronary artery bypass graft , valvuloplasty , aortic surgery , combine procedure . The first objective monocentric prospective cohort study , evaluate underestimate specific risk factor surgical site infection , perioperative period , patient undergo cardiac surgery sternotomy . Secondly , estimate specific risk associate class micro-organism responsible , profile resistance . The outcome concern occurrence surgical site infection diagnose surgeon charge patient , one month three month surgery ; may concern pre operative period , procedure , early post operative period , characterize high density care , even late rehabilitation , discharge surgical unit . Secondary outcome evaluate profile agent identify regard susceptibility prophylaxis recommend prevent wound infection ; may suggest adequate antibiotic prophylaxis often insufficient take account responsible agent , decolonisation always helpful , view emerge case failure due develop resistance . Considering low incidence type complication , investigator estimate period two year might necessary include sufficient number patient , least one thousand , order find dozen factor might significantly associate increase risk surgical site infection . The evaluation permit collaboration anesthesiologist , surgeon , intensivists , hygienist , along presence patient department , discharge hospital readmission eventually infectious complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgical site infection follow cardiac surgery source significant morbidity mortality . It may occur patient present preexist fragilizing underlying condition , suffer major surgical traumatism , consider sternotomy , presence eventual extracorporeal circulation , bleed risk associate procedure , hypothermia , etc . Many risk factor already study , might target prevented measure . Some concern pre-operative period , related patient 's underlying condition , disinfection eventual decolonisation patient ; concern procedure intrinsically , accord surgical technique prefer ; important role may accord post-operative period , high density care might responsible eventual contamination , recolonisation , fragilisation patient , thus make susceptible infection . Despite control modifiable risk factor application preventive measure , face progressive increase surgical site infection since month . We aim prospectively exhaustively evaluate risk factor play role , surgical period , routine procedure involve sternotomy , include coronary artery bypass graft , valvuloplasty ( except endocarditis ) , thoracic aortic surgery , combine procedure , without consider degree emergency , presence extracorporeal membrane , every major adult admit department cardiothoracic surgery . Those event related contemporary increase activity department cardiothoracic surgery . This hypothesis advance explanation , grow number patient operate last month could n't factor responsible post-operative infectious complication . Moreover , microbiological epidemiology simply allow single target preventive strategy particular agent responsible infection , bacterial population globally comparable classical one identify type surgery . It include large majority gram positive cocci , essentially Staphylococcus aureus ( find quasi absence methicillin-resistance ) epidermis , significant prevalence gram negative bacillus . So evidence epidemic recrudescence link specific microbiological element could easily identify . Nevertheless , recommend prophylaxis deserve reconsider , regard overall emergence every class microbial agent , constitute real problem face intensive care unit ; thus , seem logical consider protocol apply several year may lose efficacy epidemiology resistance constant accelerate evolution . So microbial agent could identical classically identify , may susceptibility . At least , might consider eventual modification choice prophylaxis administer . The evaluation start preoperatively information eligible patient , admission cardiothoracic department , also initiate preoperative anesthaesic evaluation . In case , moment admission operate room dedicate resident surgery anesthesiolgy recense pre exist condition . Then time procedure may involve different actor ( perfusionist , member anesthesiologic team , surgeon ) examine step procedure , pre-established checklist every one access ( inform file patient enter operate room ) . After surgery , care occur dedicate unit long patient 's status justify intensive monitoring , often invasive , eventual appropriate suppliance mediate drug device accord intensivist praticians charge , surgeon anesthesiologist , procedure patient 's tolerance . As early possible , discharge unit decide pursuit conventional sector , patient charge surgical staff , moderate surveillance permit early rehabilitation , discharge hospital , towards rehabilitation facility , return home . The follow-up commonly accomplished actor take part operating room , intensive care unit . But hospitalisation discharge , surgeon ' role diagnose declare hygienists infectious complication might consider surgical site infection . In case re-admission complication , hygienist staff also receive declaration . In order collect exhaustively interesting variable , surgery , period potentially prolong 3months , one member anesthesiologist staff charge audit follow-up every care unit inside hospital admission discharge , also check eventual event occur , hygienist inform event . An ancillary study might next conduct , order evaluate pharmacokinetic antibiotic prophylaxis patient extracorporeal circulation . It might eventually study modality continuous administration prolong time surgery ; might include blood sample procedure immediately repeat antibiotic dosage . Sites blood sample take extracorporeal circulation catheter use routine monitoring , radial artery catheter , invasive blood pressure monitoring , constant mean surveillance peroperatively surgery intensive care unit . So procedure implicate invasive manipulation already part routine standard care .</detailed_description>
