	<brief_title>Promoting CRC Screening Urban Minority Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project extension investigator ' early study ( Healthy Colon Project I ) investigator demonstrate telephone outreach individual significant effect CRC screen hard-to-reach , work class , urban minority population ( ~27.0 % screen receive telephone outreach vs. ~6.1 % screen receive printed educational material ) . Additional investigation suggest possible benefit intervene primary care physician ( PCPs ) regard CRC screen referral follow-up practice . In current project , investigator conduct 3-group randomized trial . The aims follow : Aim 1 : Evaluate incremental effect tailor telephone education ( TTE ) , effect academic detailing ( AD ) , increase rate CRC screen 12-months post-randomization ; Aim 2 : Evaluate effect academic detail alone ( AD ) minimal intervention ( control group ) , increase rate CRC screen 12-months post-randomization ; Aim 3 : Identify factor mediate effectiveness intervention ; Aim 4 : Identify factor moderate effectiveness intervention among subgroup . In one group , participant receive printed education material . In second group , participant ' PCPs receive academic detailing ( AD ) improve CRC screen referral follow-up practice . And third group , PCPs receive AD participant receive tailored telephone education ( TTE ) . Participants member union-based , self-administered self-insured benefit fund NYC metropolitan area . The educational intervention approach inform investigator ' early study among population , goal help participant make informed choice screening . The CRC PEM describe importance early detection prevention , risk factor , importance talk subject 's doctor CRC screening . The PEM highlight colonoscopy test identify prevent CRC describe prepare colonoscopy begin seven day prior test . The PEM also describe CRC screen test , include FOBT , FIT , sigmoidoscopy , barium enema virtual colonoscopy . Academic detail ( AD ) involve in-person visit member research team attempt communicate strategy improve CRC screen uptake practice 's patient panel . In case PCP unavailable , office staff member approach . A brief description RCT follow semi-structured interview assess usual practice regard CRC screen referral follow .

In contrast earlier RCT , current study 's TTE clearly represent colonoscopy screen method choice , encourage alternative screening method well . This emphasis consistent goal New York City Department Health Mental Hygiene American Cancer Society time study . Rapport establish , TTE dialogue focus identify address barrier might impede receipt screen . Verbal commitment elicit : speak PCP make appointment colonoscopy , request home stool test , appropriate . Follow call assessed progress towards achieve goal . Three type data collect . Baseline survey data assess eligibility measure variety demographic variable . Implementation data monitor extent AD TTE intervention conduct plan .
