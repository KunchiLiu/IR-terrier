	<brief_summary>Many Veterans recent war Iraq Afghanistan struggle chronic insomnia ( trouble fall stay asleep ) . Most current intervention insomnia time-consuming , make difficult young , work group Veterans use benefit intervention . The investigator assess whether Veterans find helpful use two health information technology tool , one measuring participant sleep ( WatchPAT ) one manage participant sleep ( CBTI Coach ) . The WatchPAT measure physiological sleep Veteran participant 's home . The CBTI Coach mobile health application use Veteran 's mobile phone tablet teach skill reduce insomnia . The investigator combine use WatchPAT CBTI Coach Veterans self-manage insomnia home . Participants record physiological sleep self-report sleep home 6 week self-management program . The investigator measure Veterans find tools helpful easy use , Veterans find tools helpful .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sleep disturbance form chronic insomnia ( difficulty fall stay asleep ) major health care problem Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) , Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) , Operation New Dawn ( OND ) Veterans . Chronic insomnia often co-morbid mental behavioral health issue posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) , common Veterans . Current behavioral intervention like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia ( CBTI ) use treat chronic insomnia effective , time-consuming . As result , largely young , work cohort Veterans use benefit intervention much could . The investigator assess usability feasibility two health information technology ( HIT ) tool measure objective subjective sleep , self-managing chronic insomnia . An exist mobile sleep monitoring device use VA sleep clinic , WatchPAT , use measure objective sleep parameter Veteran 's home . A benefit tool detect probable sleep apnea , permit referral Veterans sleep apnea treatment instead insomnia self-management . An exist VA mobile health application ( app ) , CBTI Coach , use mobile device teach skill reduce insomnia base element manualized CBTI . The goal combine WatchPAT CBTI Coach along self-management guidance help Veterans chronic insomnia learn improve sleep . As part 6-week pre-post intervention pilot usability feasibility trial , patient record objective subjective sleep home begin 6-week self-management trial end . Subjective sleep report form sleep diary measure throughout program part use CBTI Coach app . The objective subjective sleep report combine accessible mobile device use help guide sleep self-management participant . Self-management aid self-management worksheet feature CBTI Coach App . Usability two HIT tool assess within conceptual framework Integrated Technology Acceptance Model via survey item HIT tool . Feasibility assess use measure number time element CBTI Coach access 6-week program , semi-structured qualitative interview conducted end program . In interview , investigator obtain information barrier facilitator use WatchPAT CBTI Coach . If high use tool insomnia self-management , pilot study provide important incremental value new VA CBTI Coach app . The investigator also collect data user factor impact use tool ( e.g. , depression , mild traumatic brain injury , age ) , thereby either able target tool toward likely use , suggest development increase use potential user . The pilot sample provide preliminary data sleep outcome . The proposed work responsive multiple priority area HSR &amp; D include Healthcare Informatics , Healthcare Access , Mental Behavioral Health , Post-deployment Health . By partner VA Office Connected Health ( Web Mobile Solutions ) , VA 's eHealth QUERI , developer VA CBTI Coach App , investigator ensure finding maximally useful future version CBTI Coach app .
