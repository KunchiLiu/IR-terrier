	<brief_title>Olaparib Maintenance Treatment Versus Placebo Patients With PSR Ovarian Cancer Who Are CR PR Platinum-based Chemotherapy Whose Tumours Carry sBRCAm HRR-associated Genes Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase III , randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-centre study ass efficacy olaparib maintenance monotherapy relapse high grade epithelial ovarian cancer patient ( include patient primary peritoneal / fallopian tube cancer ) respond follow platinum base chemotherapy . The study population enrol two separate cohort enrol simultaneously . The confirmatory cohort consist patient carry somatic BRCA mutation ( document mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 predict deleterious suspect deleterious ) detect tumour material absent germline blood testing ; exploratory cohort include patient mutation ( document mutation predict deleterious suspect deleterious ) non BRCA HRR-associated gene detect tumour material regardless germline status .</detailed_description>
