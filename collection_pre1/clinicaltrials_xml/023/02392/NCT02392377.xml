	<brief_title>Molecular Phenotyping Predicting Response Patients With Stage IB-III Esophageal Cancer Receiving Combination Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate gene micro ribonucleic acid ( miRNA ) expression level patient esophageal adenocarcinoma prior receive chemotherapy identify relative expression difference patient respond respond treatment carboplatin paclitaxel 5-fluorouracil ( fluorouracil ) oxaliplatin measure fludeoxyglucose F-18 ( [ 18F ] FDG ) -positron emission tomography ( PET ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate impact treatment expression pattern gene miRNAs patient esophageal adenocarcinoma follow treatment either carboplatin paclitaxel 5-fluorouracil oxaliplatin , identify expression pattern associate treatment response resistance assess ( 18F ) FDG-PET . II . To evaluate expression pattern gene miRNAs patient esophageal adenocarcinoma prior follow full neoadjuvant combined-modality treatment program either carboplatin paclitaxel 5-fluorouracil oxaliplatin chemotherapy plus radiation , identify relative expression difference patient achieve pathologic complete response patient achieve pathologic complete response . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : INDUCTION : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute carboplatin intravenously IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CHEMORADIATION THERAPY : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenous piggyback ( IVPB ) 60 minute carboplatin IVPB 30 minute day 8 22 . Patients also undergo radiation therapy daily ( QD ) 5 day week . Treatment continue 5-6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : INDUCTION : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2-6 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV continuously 46-48 hour . Treatment repeat every 14 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CHEMORADIATION THERAPY : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2-6 hour day 1 , 15 , 29 fluorouracil IV continuously 96 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 . Patients also undergo radiation therapy QD 5 day week 5-6 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . SURGERY : In arm , approximately 4-10 week completion chemoradiation therapy , patient undergo esophagectomy discretion treat team . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
