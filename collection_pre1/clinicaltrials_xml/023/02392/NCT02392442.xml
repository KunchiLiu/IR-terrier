	<brief_summary>Background : - When bacteria enter lung , serious infection occur . Researchers want learn process inflammation lung study lung cell product make . Lung cell influence infection , smoking , molecule make within body . Researchers also want learn one molecule , call microRNA ( micro ribonucleic acid ) . Objective : - To better body respond infection . Also , understand cell lung secrete microRNA may influence lung cell . Eligibility : - Healthy , non-smoking adult age 18-45 . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They blood urine test electrocardiogram . - Participants blood drawn arm vein . They intravenous catheter ( small plastic tube ) place vein . - All participant bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage . They numb medicine . A thin flexible tube place nasal passage mouth airways lung . - Some participant bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage ( rinse airway salt water ) order obtain cell lung . The water suction . - Some participant two bronchoscopies ; first procedure , endotoxin , molecule find bacteria squirt small portion lung . Endotoxin molecule act like infection one . After 6 48 hour , bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage do look lung response endotoxin . - Participants heart rhythm rate , temperature blood oxygen level monitor procedure . - Participants call next day see feeling .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Defining mechanism limit tissue injury acute inflammation may provide basis prevent secondary organ dysfunction serious infection . We plan use human endotoxin lung challenge model study mechanism associate initiation resolution lung inflammation . Endotoxin ( LPS ) , outer membrane component Gram-negative bacteria , major microbial factor mediates inflammation associate serious infection . For fifty year , endotoxin administer human challenge agent order understand basic mechanism inflammation , provide proof principle pharmacologic intervention ( e.g. , anti-cytokines , corticosteroid ) , adjuvant immunotherapy malignancy . We previously develop human model study initiation resolution inflammation lung segment follow endotoxin bronchial instillation . The inflammatory response limit challenged segment minimal associate systemic response . After direct instillation lung segment , endotoxin elicits inflammatory response characterize local production inflammatory mediator , proteins increase cellularity . The predominate cell specie find bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) challenge segment change neutrophil influx 2 - 6 hour influx monocyte lymphocytes 24 48 hour follow endotoxin challenge . At 6 hour , BAL pro-inflammatory activity ( i.e. , tumor necrosis factor bioactivity induction intercellular adhesion molecule-1 reporter cell ) present absent 24 48 hour post endotoxin . In addition , unique subset lymphocytes present lung inflammatory response . We recently show non-cellular microRNAs ( miRNAs ) present archive BAL normal healthy volunteer airway differentially express 6 hour endotoxin-induced acute lung inflammation . miRNA single strand non-coding RNA mediate posttranscriptional regulation gene expression . Some extracellular miRNA specie may modulate local distant cell process . miRNA activate Toll-like receptor ( TLRs ) describe blood biomarkers different disease state . However , specific role extracellular secrete miRNAs lung poorly define . Our research plan design study role miRNA acute lung inflammation investigate change miRNA signature find BAL lung cell healthy volunteer baseline 6 , 24 , 48 hour endotoxin segmental lung challenge . A panel flow cytometry cell surface marker perform blood BAL cell intracellular secrete miRNA isolate specific cell specie ( i.e. , neutrophil , monocyte , macrophage , lymphocyte ) . We hypothesize miRNA role modulate initiation resolution inflammation .</detailed_description>
