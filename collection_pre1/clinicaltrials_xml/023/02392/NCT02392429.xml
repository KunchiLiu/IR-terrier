	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study fluorothymidine F 18 ( FLT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) measure response patient previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia . FLT radioactive substance may `` light '' cancer body . FLT inject blood build cell divide , include cancer cell . Diagnostic procedure , PET/CT , may help measure patient 's response earlier treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FLT PET/CT Measuring Response Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate negative predictive value ( NPV ) post-treatment FLT PET/CT image complete remission ( CR ) patient receive induction chemotherapy acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate positive predictive value ( PPV ) post-treatment FLT PET/CT image complete remission . II . To estimate sensitivity specificity FLT PET/CT complete remission detection . III . To evaluate pre-treatment FLT PET/CT activity predictor complete remission . IV . To evaluate change pre-treatment post-treatment FLT PET/CT activity predictor complete remission . V. To correlate post-treatment FLT PET/CT image parameter day 28 bone marrow aspirate/biopsy minimal residual disease assessment flow cytometry . VI . To correlate FLT PET/CT image parameter ( maximum FLT uptake across total bone marrow compartment [ SUVmax ] , mean FLT uptake across total bone marrow compartment [ SUVmean ] , heterogeneity ) biologic correlate ( minimal residual disease [ MRD ] assessment ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive anthracycline intravenously ( IV ) day 1-3 cytarabine IV day 1-7 2 course . Patients undergo FLT PET/CT within 3 day nadir bone marrow biopsy ( day 10-17 initiation first induction cycle prior reinduction ) . Patients may undergo optional FLT PET/CT prior induction chemotherapy interfere commencement treatment . After completion study , patient follow day 28-35 .</detailed_description>
