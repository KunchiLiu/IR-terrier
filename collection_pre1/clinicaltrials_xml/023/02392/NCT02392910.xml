	<detailed_description>Effect i.v . iron sucrose iron parameter anemia - During original 6 month trial , patient i.v . iron group receive 1000mg iron per protocol . No patient require iron subsequent 6 month . - During subsequent follow-up , patient require mean 165 274 mg iron per year ( range : 0 600 mg per patient per year ) . - Post initial 1000mg iron , 19 20 patient require least second dose i.v . iron . Most patient require one two dos per year . - The average time require second iron administration 14.5 ± 2.7 month ( range : 14 month , 23 month ) . - Correction iron deficiency ( ID ) result statistically significant increase transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) throughout study ( p &lt; 0.01 untreated group ) . At measured point , TSAT value treat group least target ( &gt; 20 % increase ) . - For serum ferritin , significant difference observe 6 month 1 year however difference observe 5 year post baseline serum ferritin value 173ng/mL 167ng/mL control IV iron group , respectively . - Statistically significant improvement versus untreated group observe hemoglobin ( Hb ) creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) well leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional class year . Effect i.v . iron sucrose hospitalization mortality - There numerically few hospitalization report 6 month compare among untreated patient ( 0 % 25 % , respectively ) , although difference versus untreated patient statistically significant ( p=ns ) . - At 1 year commence original study , number patient require hospitalization ( reason ) 50 % control group 10 % IV iron group ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . - By 5 year follow-up rate increase 85 % control arm 20 % IV iron treat group ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . - In relation all-cause mortality , death either group first 6 month . The number death due cause year 1 increase group ( 20 % untreated group , 5 % treated group ; p=ns ) . - At 5 year follow-up , 11 ( 55 % ) patient control arm decease , compare 4 ( 20 % ) IV iron treat group ( p &lt; 0.05 ) .</detailed_description>
