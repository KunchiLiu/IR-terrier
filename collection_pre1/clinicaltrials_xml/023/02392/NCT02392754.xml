	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) major treatable risk factor stroke , may hard detect frequently silent intermittent . New ambulatory cardiac monitoring technology potential improve early detection AF . This trial investigate AF screen primary care patient use ZIO XT Patch , wearable adhesive patch monitor provide continuous ECG record 14 day , addition WatchBP home blood pressure monitor built-in AF screening capability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Home-Based Screening Early Detection Atrial Fibrillation Primary Care Patients Aged 75 Years Older</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCREEN-AF investigator-initiated , multicenter , open-label , two-group randomize controlled trial investigate non-invasive , home-based AF screening . The trial target patient age 75 year old history hypertension without know AF would potential anticoagulant candidate AF detect . Eligible participant recruit primary care practice randomly allocate ( 1:1 ) one two group : - The control group receive standard care 6 month ( include pulse check heart auscultation physician baseline 6 month ) . - The intervention group undergo ambulatory screen AF 2-week continuous ECG patch monitor worn baseline 3 month , addition standard care 6 month ( include pulse check heart auscultation physician baseline 6 month ) . The intervention group also receive home BP monitor automatic AF detection capability use twice daily 2 week ECG monitoring block . The hypothesis continuous ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring use adhesive ECG patch monitor superior standard care AF detection . The overall aim research establish practical cost-effective screening strategy could apply primary care early detection AF patient would benefit anticoagulant therapy AF detect . The ultimate goal primary prevention initiative prevent stroke , stroke-related death , disability , dementia , hospitalization institutionalization , early detection treatment AF .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age ≥75 year without know atrial fibrillation atrial flutter . 2 . The participant clinically sinus rhythm ( heart auscultation 30 second pulse palpation perform enrol physician neither detects irregular rhythm suggestive atrial fibrillation ) . 3 . History hypertension require antihypertensive medication . 4 . Written inform consent participant . 1 . Any previously document atrial fibrillation atrial flutter ≥30 second . 2 . Implanted pacemaker , cardiac defibrillator , cardiac loop recorder , deep brain stimulator . 3 . Likely poorly compliant unreliable use home screening device study followup requirement cognitive issue , life expectancy &lt; 6 month due concomitant disease . 4 . Has condition opinion enrol physician would permit chronic treatment oral anticoagulant therapy . 5 . Patient already take longterm oral anticoagulant therapy . 6 . Known allergic reaction/intolerance skin adhesive .</criteria>
