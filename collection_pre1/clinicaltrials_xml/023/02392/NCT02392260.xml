	<brief_summary>This project part EU fund project NISTAS . NISTAS aim development new medical device non-contact , non-invasive screen health status vascular system adult subject . The instrument , call VascuLight , intend deploy out-patient points-of-care hospital , provide output parameter related PWV measure local and/or regional level . NISTAS bring together four European SMEs four different , complementary , technology area ( JULIGHT , ECLEXYS , EPI-LIGHT , OIP ) link five RTD Performers ( UNIPV , OSM , CORK UNIVERSITY , Saphyrion , Eudax srl ) develop new knowledge new medical device significant commercial benefit SME partner . VascuLight respond unmet need medical diagnosis practice : request fast sustainable method screen health vascular system large series , capable provide reliable indicator cardiovascular risk screen subject . The VascuLight idea found paradigm shift : bringing adapt biomedical field measurement technique date confine industrial environment . NISTAS develop new non-contact distance/displacement/vibration sensor base variant well-known reliable laser triangulation technique . JUL UNIPV carry proof-of-concept , in-vivo test VascuLight approach demonstrate concept realistic attainable . Results obtain use Laser Doppler Vibrometry ( LDV ) , displacement-measuring technique base principle light interference , area JUL UNIPV make important contribution . In test possible use TWO small LDV optical head simultaneously measure pulse wave two point carotid space 2.5 cm , allow calculation time-delay pulse wave , thus provide direct local measurement PWV . The aim study test implement contactless optical technique measurement PWV arterial stiffness carotid artery level . To evaluate validity measure method , investigator compare Vasculight v1.0 PWV measure obtain e-tracking ( echocardiographic method ) . The main idea compare distribution measure ( comparable mean standard deviation ) mix adult population , use two different method .</brief_summary>
