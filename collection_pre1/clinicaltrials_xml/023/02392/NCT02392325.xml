	<brief_title>Evaluating Clinical Immune Response Two Dengue Virus Vaccines Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dengue mosquito-borne flavivirus . There 4 type dengue virus ( DENV-1 , DENV-2 , DENV-3 , DENV-4 ) , cause mild illness life-threatening disease . The purpose study evaluate immunologic clinical response two dengue vaccine ( rDEN1Δ30 rDEN2Δ30-7169 ) , give 9 month apart , healthy adult history previous flavivirus infection . Participants randomly assign receive rDEN1Δ30 vaccine placebo vaccine Day 0 . Additional study visit occur Days 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 21 , 28 , 56 , 90 , 180 , 240 .
