	<detailed_description>A dramatic increase number infant diagnose Deformational Plagiocephaly ( DP ) observe worldwide since institution American Academy Pediatrics ' Back Sleep Program . According one publish report , incidence DP range 3-48 % ; translate into120,000-2 million infants/year develop DP United States alone . Some healthcare provider believe DP purely cosmetic condition . This mindset undermines importance prevention correction . In New Zealand , recent study demonstrate 39 % child without corrective action persistent DP age 3 4 year . Additionally , several study demonstrate association impaired social interaction , developmental problem DP.Thus researcher believe may spectrum untoward outcome brain remodel result DP . Recent technological advance allow detection diminutive change brain structure . In multidisciplinary descriptive pilot study use brain MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) cerebral tissue oxygenation monitor , namely Frequency Domain Near Infrared Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy ( FDNIR/DCS ) describe difference brain structure characteristic exist infant significant DP correction deformational defect . This study enable investigator seek preliminary evidence brain development influence shape cranial vault , change brain structure characteristic occur helmet therapy . Additionally study help determine need large investigation phenomenon would establish association DP developmental delay .</detailed_description>
