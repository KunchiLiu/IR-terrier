	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate side effect safety , effectiveness combine dabrafenib trametinib radiotherapy . Previous ongoing clinical trial demonstrate effectiveness safety combine dabrafenib trametinib compare dabrafenib alone . This lead approval use drug combination people metastatic melanoma BRAF mutation . Melanoma spread part body may also benefit radiotherapy help reduce symptom melanoma . Previous study show melanoma may sensitive radiotherapy help improve quality life . The intention CombiRT study establish dabrafenib , trametinib radiotherapy combine safe effective treatment metastatic melanoma .</brief_summary>
