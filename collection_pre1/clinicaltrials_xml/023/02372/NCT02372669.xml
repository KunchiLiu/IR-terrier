	<brief_title>Chitosan Nerv Tube Primary Repair Traumatic Sensory Nerve Lesions Hand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard therapy nerve injury hand without gap direct tension free microsurgical repair . Often , nerve tube use addition direct nerve suture protect nerve scar formation guide regenerate axon distal stump , still lack data approach . The basic design nerve tube similar make different resorbable biomaterials . Chitosan , derivative chitin , biocompatible similar natural glycosaminoglycans . In vivo study show positive effect survival orientation Schwann cell well survival differentiation neuronal cell prevention painful neuromas . Therefore ideal material nerve tube . In study want test Chitosan base nerve tube ( already certify German medical product European label ( CE-label ) ) - additional treatment digital nerve injury without gap . This study enroll participant traumatic sensory nerve lesion 3 Centres : Trauma Center Ludwigshafen ( Ludwigshafen , Germany ) , Trauma Center Frankfurt Main ( Frankfurt Main , Germany ) Trauma Center Bochum ( Bochum , Germany ) . After inform study potential risk , patient traumatic sensory nerve lesion consecutively screen eligibility . The study conduct four successive period . All enrol participant randomize locally alternate local list Double-Blind Period . After enrolment , assign subject number use Case Report Forms . The kind intervention blind participant investigator follow-up involve surgery . Enrolled participant randomize 1:1 ratio primary microsurgical repair additional use nerve tube , direct tension free microsurgical repair alone . Data collect Case Report Forms ( CRFs ) accord European DIN standard ( International Standards Organization ( EN ISO ) 14155 ) Good Clinical Practice recommendation . CRFs transmit electronically executive study centre Ludwigshafen check integrity , quality consistency . The executive study centre also ensure standardisation registry process , operative procedure follow-up participating center periodic monitoring . Furthermore write instruction course instruction provide Investigator . Data collect analyzed executive study centre . There also CRFs report drop-outs reporting adverse event . The static 2-point-discrimination ( 2PD ) 6 month bet primary outcome parameter . Assumptions gold standard treatment make literature . The mean 2-PD 6 month approximately 8 mm standard deviation 3 mm . A decrease 2 mm 2-PD would clinically relevant assumed experimental intervention . Using 2-sided t-test level 0.05 power 80 % , require 37 patient per group order show superiority . The primary endpoint test per-protocol set ( PPS ) via analysis covariance centre factor distance lesion finger pulp covariate . Secondary objective describe without confirmatory analysis . In order compensate loss follow-up data 50 patient per group randomize .</detailed_description>
