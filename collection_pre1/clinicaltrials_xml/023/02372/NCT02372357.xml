	<brief_title>A New Dosing Regimen Posaconazole Prophylaxis Children Based Body Surface Area</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Invasive fungal infection ( IFI ) , especially candidiasis aspergillosis , serious threat immunocompromised pediatric patient . Because diagnosis IFI pediatric patient difficult , due lack specific clinical radiological sign low sensitivity blood culture , antifungal prophylaxis would largely optimize management IFI setting . However , antifungal prophylaxis remain matter debate , clear consensus yet reach optimal drug . Very limited pediatric data available , current guideline mainly base extrapolation adult data . Fluconazole remain drug choice many center , despite non-mould active spectrum . Itraconazole , liposomal amphotericin B nebulized lipid-formulations amphotericin B often use off-label , although neither pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , efficacy safety document proper way . Voriconazole register child old 2 year age , mainly treatment set . Moreover , extremely variable PK profile , uncertainty adequate exposure risk hepatotoxicity neurotoxicity favor use voriconazole setting . Finally , micafungin low recommendation prophylactic setting , due possible risk liver tumour . Posaconazole would ideal antifungal drug use prophylactically child many reason . It broad spectrum activity , include emerge mould like Aspergillus spp . Zygomycetes . It show superior fluconazole itraconazole prevent IFI adult favorable safety profile , nausea vomit frequently encounter adverse event . However , lack pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data child young 13 year age , result marginal recommendation current guideline [ 8 ] . Little information available correct dose regimen available oral suspension young pediatric patient , similar observe adult , often low posaconazole plasma concentration ( PPCs ) measure . Therefore , therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) recommend reach adequate PPCs 0.5mg/L 0.7 mg/L follow increase dose need . In study , pharmacokinetics newly introduce dose regimen posaconazole oral suspension investigate , base body surface area ( BSA ) , use prophylactically immunocompromised child age 13 . Pediatric patient , admit hospital receive chemotherapy hematopoietic stem cell transplantation treat prophylactically posaconazole 120mg/m² tid . At steady state ( least 7 day posaconazole treatment ) , 9 plasma sample collect patient calculate area curve relevant PK parameter maximum minimal plasma concentration , volume distribution , halflife clearance rate . Finally , result compare adult data literature evaluate whether 120mg/m² tid adequate dose regimen child .</detailed_description>
