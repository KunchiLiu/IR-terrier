	<brief_summary>By employ combination advance MRI technique correlative serum biomarkers blood brain barrier ( BBB ) disruption , investigator plan develop powerful , first kind clinical algorithm pediatrics whereby investigator measure identify window maximal BBB disruption post MLA 1 ) allow alternative surgery incompletely resect tumor , 2 ) allow optimal chemotherapeutic dosing achieve great benefit least systemic side effect 3 ) distinguish subsequent tumor progression long-term MLA treatment effect . Preliminary data adult image study show BBB disruption last several week follow treatment return low baseline . This pilot therapeutic study provide preliminary validation pediatric patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>ARM A Newly diagnose incompletely resect pediatric glioma ( grade IIV ) determine candidate MLA treat neurosurgeon Age 3 ≤ 21 Karnofsky/Lansky performance status ≥ 60 % ARM B Recurrent pediatric brain tumor determine candidate MLA determine treat neurosurgeon . Unequivocal evidence tumor progression MRI There must interval least 12 week completion radiotherapy study registration except unequivocal evidence tumor recurrence per RANO criterion . When interval le 12 week completion radiotherapy , use PET scan allow differentiate evidence tumor recurrence pseudoprogression . Recurrent lesion dimension contour determine treat neurosurgeon appropriate MLA . Age 3 ≤ 21 Karnofsky/Lansky performance status ≥ 60 % Adequate cardiac function determine shorten fraction ≥ 27 % leave ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50 % echocardiogram within past 1 year prior registration . Prior anthracycline therapy exceed 200 mg/m^2 total cumulative dose . Adequate bone marrow hepatic function define ( must within 7 day MLA ) : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000/mcl ( GCSF allow ) Platelets ≥ 100 K/cumm Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ( pRBC transfusion +/ ESA allow ) ALT ≤ 3 x ULN AST ≤ 3 x ULN ALP ≤ 3 x ULN . If ALP &gt; 3 x ULN , GGT must check ≤ 3 x ULN . Bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN At time registration , patient must recover toxic effect prior therapy grade 1 toxicity . At time registration , patient must least 4 week prior cytotoxic chemotherapy . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) .

Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Premenopausal woman must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 14 day study entry . Inability undergo MRI due personal medical reason . Known history HIV autoimmune disease require immunosuppressant drug . ARM B Prior treatment bevacizumab within 12 week study entry . Previous treatment complete cumulative dos daunorubicin , idarubicin , and/or anthracyclines anthracenediones equivalent total dose &gt; 200 mg/m2 doxorubicin . More 2 prior relapse ( count current relapse treat study ) . Currently receive investigational agent intend treatment relapsed tumor . Multifocal metastatic disease .
