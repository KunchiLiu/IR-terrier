	<brief_summary>Sepsis common cause childhood death worldwide . Millions child survive , leave impaired health . Sepsis-related Acute Kidney Injury ( sAKI ) increasingly recognize significant factor associate long-term mortality among different patient population . Renal dysfunction subsequent chronic kidney disease implicate development hypertension cardiovascular disease . The investigator overall hypothesis , pediatric population , sepsis-related AKI unrecognized , long-term consequence regard kidney function , endothelial function , blood pressure control , overall health .</brief_summary>
