	<brief_summary>Dexamethasone steroid commonly use prevention chemotherapy-induced nausea vomiting ( CINV ) . While effective , high dose dexamethasone associate numerous side effect , even use short duration . One effect elevate blood glucose , hyperglycemia . Current literature suggest increase risk infection , poor wound heal , increased mortality non-cancer surgical patient steroid-induced hyperglycemia . There also evidence support elevation blood glucose associate worsened outcome cancer patient . Much data come cancer patient treat inpatient set blood glucose routinely check . Limited data available describing fluctuation blood glucose follow dexamethasone administration cancer patient manage outpatient setting , Anschutz Cancer Pavilion ( ACP ) Infusion Clinic . This study aim characterize effect dexamethasone blood glucose cancer patient utilize Continuous Glucose Monitoring ( CGM ) device . These device minimally invasive , FDA approve , produce real-time data blood glucose fluctuation course 3-7 day . By insert device skin abdomen , investigator evaluate temporal relationship glucose abnormality dexamethasone administration . Results study increase knowledge base dexamethasone-induced hyperglycemia identify patient increase risk , also allow future research conduct order determine standard protocol proactively minimize steroid-induced glucose fluctuation .</brief_summary>
