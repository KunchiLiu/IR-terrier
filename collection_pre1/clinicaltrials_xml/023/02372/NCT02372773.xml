	<detailed_description>This multicenter study enroll 300 member familial Frontotemporal Dementia ( FTD ) family across 8 experienced FTD research center know mutation MAPT , PGRN , C9ORF72 ( 100 mutation carrier mild dementia minimally symptomatic yet non-demented , 100 asymptomatic mutation carrier , 100 clinically normal relative non-mutation carrier ) obtain annual assessment include T1-MRI , FLAIR , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , ASL perfusion ( ASLp ) , intrinsic connectivity functional MRI ( icfMRI ) , MR spectroscopy ( MRS ) , CSF , blood , behavioral , neuropsychological functional assessment , total three assessment per participant . A primary goal study identify robust reliable method track disease progression familial FTD disease-modifying therapeutic trial design appropriately .</detailed_description>
