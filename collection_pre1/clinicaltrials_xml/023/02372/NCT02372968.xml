	<detailed_description>The study carry metabolic unit Nestlé Research Center ( Lausanne ) . A large cohort subject recruit among Nestlé employee . Body composition determine iDXA ( Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ) basal metabolism measure metabonomic analysis urine plasma sample . Individual food habit physical activity assess questionnaire . The clinical protocol plan also measurement energy expenditure ( EE ) indirect calorimetry subset twenty subject . These EE data use validate iDXA outcomes rest energy expenditure . The volunteer participate second time study case would like control evolution body composition metabolism period dietary regime physical training . In case , minimum period two month visit require . After two day dietary restriction , volunteer come morning metabolic unit fast state , urine blood sampling . The metabolism food bias metabonomic analysis . Therefore , consumption alcoholic beverage , fish meal , liquorice , grapefruit , power drink bar , spice , mineral supplement , soft drink , chocolate , coffee tea limit 2 cup per day , allow two day precede visit . In addition , intake pain-killers antiinflammatory drug forbidden two day sample urine blood metabolism alters metabolic profile blood urine . Antibiotics alter gut microflora , activity represent important contributor urinary metabolic profile . In order preserve gut microflora-related metabolic information , recommend minimum period one month end antibiotic therapy visit metabolic unit . On visit day , subject come fast metabolic unit , : - Answer medical question interview doctor charge study - Fill two questionnaire food habit physical activity . A dietician CHUV visit NRC ask question relative food habit . This validate new questionnaire fill - Give sample urine - Undergo iDXA scan ( 2 consecutive measure run two visit , order assess intra-individual variability result ) measure state hydration bioimpedance The analysis plasma sample recommend complete metabonomic analysis . However , blood sample freely decide participant . The protocol plan also perform measurement rest energy expenditure indirect calorimetry subset twenty subject .</detailed_description>
