	<brief_summary>Patients eligibility target therapy relies molecular test perform tumor sample collect biopsy . This invasive procedure associate relative high risk morbidity require intervention costly important technical platform . Thus , inoperable patient deprive potentially efficient therapy . A `` liquid biopsy '' Circulating Tumor Cells ( CTCs ) present blood molecular characterization appeal alternative meet urgent need patient . Moreover CTC-based molecular test currently routinely available . The 5-year survival rate patient non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) low . Recent report demonstrate detection ALK rearrangement tumor tissue allow patient late-stages NSCLC benefit crizotinib treatment . However , 1 ) detection ALK rearrangement currently perform small biopsy fine-needle aspirate hinder limited tissue quantity available . Tumor tissue difficult obtain patient advanced/metastatic lung cancer surgery rarely component treatment . Finding alternative effective mean diagnose ALK rearrangement critical issue identify patient may benefit treatment crizotinib ; 2 ) patient develop resistance crizotinib due de novo ALK mutation . In set , circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) , show detectable ISET ( Isolation Size Epithelial Tumor Cells ) method 80 % 100 % late stage lung cancer patient represent non-invasive easily accessible source tumor material assess ALK rearrangement escape mutation kinetic manner . The ISET method first publish 2000 several independent team establish high sensitivity specificity ISET NSCLC . With ISET , specificity achieve use method criterion use cytopathologists diagnose solid tumor . The high sensitivity specificity ISET two essential start point feasibility present project . Low-throughput molecular characterization CTCs isolate ISET also achieve . The remain challenge consist develop high-throughput ISET-based molecular test personalize medicine transferable clinic . The Team 1 CHU de Nice Team 2 Gustave Roussy Institute demonstrate detection ALK rearrangement CTC isolate ISET feasible consistent result obtain corresponding tumor tissue . In context , aim project obtain 1 ) definitive prospective clinical validation use CTC alternative tumor tissue ALK analysis-based patient stratification ; 2 ) proof escape mutation detect early kinetic analysis CTC patient treat crizotinib . ALK rearrangement prospectively investigated CTCs isolate ISET diagnosis follow patient stage IIIb/IV lung cancer de novo mutation search patient resistance crizotinib . This study provide clinical economic benefit target treatment patient advance lung cancer . This project strongly original CTC-based ALK rearrangement test independently validate clinical sample . The development non-invasive theranostic test genetic analysis CTCs clinically relevant goal non-invasive stratification cancer patient , avoid morbidity relate lung biopsy surgery . It would allow determine patient 's eligibility target therapy blood sample analysis . CTC-based ALK test could useful guide choice ALK target therapy patient lung cancer . Furthermore , develop biomarkers base CTCs analysis would open way non-invasive follow aggressive cancer , early detection mutation associate resistance target therapy tailor treatment real time analysis evolve tumor cell population . This test expect markedly improve patient ' quality life avoid invasive diagnostic procedure .</brief_summary>
