	<brief_summary>The overall purpose trial ass efficacy safety use oral verapamil subject recent onset T1D order downregulate TXNIP enhance patient ' endogenous beta cell mass insulin production . The objective therefore assess parameter beta cell survival ( include new biomarkers ) , insulin production glucose control feasibility approach thereby provide basis future , larger/expanded , longer-term verapamil study off-label use approve drug T1D .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Verapamil Beta Cell Survival Therapy Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Loss pancreatic beta-cell mass key factor T1D , therapies halt process available . The investigator discover thioredoxin-interacting protein ( TXNIP ) , promise target regard find commonly use anti-hypertensive drug calcium channel-blocker , verapamil , effectively lower beta-cell TXNIP expression rodent beta-cells human islet , promote beta-cell survival rescue mice T1D . This make verapamil potentially attractive drug T1D , prospective clinical data lacking . The investigator primary objective therefore conduct randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind study efficacy safety verapamil adult recent-onset T1D demonstrate subject oral verapamil daily 12 month improve insulin production ( indirect measure beta-cell mass ) . The investigator preliminary specific aim include : # 1 Assessment remain endogenous beta-cell mass/insulin production measure change baseline mixed meal-stimulated C peptide , exogenous insulin requirement verapamil placebo treat subject Week 12 Month 12 . # 2 Assessment glycemic control measure mean amplitude glycemic excursion hypoglycemic event rate ( CGMS subject-reported ) HbA1c Week 12 Month 12 . # 3 Evaluation non-invasive marker therapeutic follow-up beta-cell mass , i.e . TXNIP expression peripheral blood monocyte baseline , Week 12 Month 12 , collection serum future assessment potential beta-cell marker ( proinsulin/C-peptide ratio , demethylated insulin DNA , microRNAs ) . Results major translational implication potential immediate impact clinical care , encourage large clinical follow-up trial , evaluate marker beta cell health ultimately help develop novel therapy enhance patient 's beta-cell mass function .</detailed_description>
