	<brief_title>Shear Wave Sonoelastography Pediatric Liver Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The evaluation pediatric liver disease continue major focus research well-characterized liver diseases liver fibrosis secondary obesity . The degree fibrosis generally well-accepted measurement disease severity prognostic indicator . Unfortunately , current gold standard ass fibrosis remain liver biopsy , , addition anesthesia risk sample error , result profound hemorrhage , infection , even mortality . Standard reliable noninvasive biomarkers hepatic fibrosis pediatric population greatly need . Sonoelastography emerge method evaluate liver disease . Three method quantitative sonoelastography currently use . Transient elastography M-mode base sonographic technique mechanical vibrator create low-frequency wave cause shear stress tissue fix depth target tissue . It gain widespread use evaluation liver fibrosis adult population ( Fibroscan ) ; however , use great limitation pediatric population use real-time ultrasonography ( B mode ) fix depth measurement take . The lack real-time imaging make impossible accurately select area appropriate sampling , fix depth appropriate young child small liver . Also , shock wave administer tailor use young child . Furthermore , technique unreliable patient obese ascites . Other method sonoelastography include Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging ( ARFI ) Shear Wave Elastography ( SWE ) . The latter also know supersonic shear wave imaging . Both technique use real-time ultrasonography administer focus high-intensity , short-duration ( acoustic radiation ) pulse produce shear wave target tissue . Neither technique limited presence ascites shear wave propagate fluid . ARFI use single push beam generate shear wave , propagation shear wave monitor use conventional pulse-echo ultrasound various off-axis lateral location . The speed shear wave tissue determine collect displacement time . This principle elastography base Young modulus use formula : E=3ρѴ2 ( E elasticity 's modulus , Ѵ speed , ρ density tissue ) . The degree tissue displacement use create elastogram . Limitations ARFI include small selected region interest ( ROI ) ( 10 mm x 5 mm ) , 1-dimensional technique , unable provide correspond elasticity map tissue . The latter also prevent retrospective evaluation tissue elasticity . SWE new elastography technique . It work generate localize radiation force travel faster acoustic axis shear wave speed produce tiny , almost simultaneous , displacement tissue position along acoustic axis . The generated shear wave shape like cone fan , know Mach cone . An ultrafast sonography perform provide side-by-side greyscale image color-coded elasticity map tissue ROI . The ROI display real time B-mode imaging , thus , represent 2-dimensional technique . Advantages include large , fan-shaped ROI ( 50mm x 50mm ) , acquisition quantitative map liver tissue stiffness correspond greyscale ultrasound image . As result , simultaneous view select region interest provide well anatomic detail correspond color map tissue elasticity may result accurate scoring stage fibrosis . The presence color map also allow retrospective analysis . Only study begin use ARFI analyze liver fibrosis pediatric population . Studies use SWE evaluation liver fibrosis also limit one performed adult ; however , early study show accurate method liver fibrosis stag . Tutar , et al safely perform study use SWE pediatric patient Turkey . No dedicate pediatric study perform United States , technology recently approve use adult FDA . The use device pediatrics represent off-label use . That say , SWE safety consideration similar Doppler mode standard ultrasound technology perform pediatric patient age . While high thermal index routine B-mode ultrasound , measure within safety limit set American Institute Ultrasound Medicine ( AIUM ) .</detailed_description>
