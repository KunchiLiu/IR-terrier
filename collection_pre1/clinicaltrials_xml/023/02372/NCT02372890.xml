	<detailed_description>In head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) , presence lymph node metastasis addition free resection margin follow surgical resection primary tumor important prognostic factor , may impact plan surgery well radiotherapy . Neck dissection histopathology regard diagnostic standard procedure define lymph node status patient HNSCC . Occult lymph node metastasis image describe 46 % patient , e.g . patient cancer tongue . Although neck dissection generally low rate intra- postoperative complication , small statistically significant group patient suffer surgery-related side effect lymphedema , chronic pain syndrome injury cranial nerve paralysis ( shoulder lift mouth angle ) . Therefore would desirable spare diagnostic neck dissection patient without macroscopic lymph node metastasis . However , sensitivity and/or specificity non-invasive imaging technique available , include positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , allow exclude lymph node metastasis , especially true small metastasis . Therefore , image able replace histological examination cervical lymph node limited impact therapeutic concept , surgical planning planning dose prescription radiotherapy . Acquisition techniques image quality PET ( glucose analog F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) ) combine examination compute tomography ( PET/CT ) considerably improve last generation PET/CT machine . New generation PET/CT machine provide significantly improve image quality image resolution image , probably high sensitivity detect small lesion . However , face expect increase detect metabolically active cervical lymph node high-resolution ( HR ) PET/CT , diagnostic problem term potentially increase number false-positive lymph node arises , e. g. due inflammatory lymphadenopathy . Until evidence-based criterion classify small metabolically active lymph node detect HR PET/CT . Hence , correlation PET/CT finding histopathology cervical lymph metastasis inflammatory lymph node patient HNSCC require develop diagnostic criterion HR PET/CT exploit diagnostic potential HR PET/CT . Modern concepts radiotherapy planning neck lymph node metastases increasingly take consideration metabolic morphological information PET/CT target volume definition . Detailed information diagnostic performance HR PET / CT importance dose prescription intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) . In radiotherapy side effect depend significantly dose irradiation volume . Modern radiation technique , especially IMRT , allow highly-conformal radiation therapy steep dose gradient protect organ salivary gland , reduce side effect radiotherapy . On hand modern radiotherapy concept carry risk fail due non-inclusion subclinical lymph node metastases target volume . HR PET/CT may allow minimize out-of-field recurrence cause incorrect target volume contour dose prescription . Evidence-based data diagnostic accuracy HR PET/CT special regard small lymph node metastasis need clarify potential role HR PET/CT radiation treatment planning . Objective : - To determine sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , PPV NPV lymph node stag HR PET/CT patient HNSCC - To determine sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , PPV NPV HR PET/CT lymph node metastases different size patient HNSCC - To determine detection rate distant metastasis PET/CT patient HNSCC - To develop diagnostic criterion multi-modal lymph node stag HR PET/CT patient HNSCC - To evaluate potential impact HR PET/CT radiation treatment plan Methods : Patients HNSCC manage accord clinical recommendation interdisciplinary tumor board . Elective patient receive selective , modified radical radical neck dissection relevant lymph node region accord clinical routine standard Inselspital Bern . The neck dissection must carry within maximum 6 week PET / CT examination . As part neck dissection lymph node send Institute Pathology separate level side topographic marker ( cranial / caudal , medial / lateral ) . The histological examination remove lymph node serf reference standard analysis PET/CT image data , calculation diagnostic accuracy HR PET/CT . Theoretical radiation treatment plan generate base conventional imaging , whole-body PET/CT HR PET/CT protocols determine impact PET/CT .</detailed_description>
