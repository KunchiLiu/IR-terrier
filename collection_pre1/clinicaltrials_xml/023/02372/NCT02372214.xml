	<detailed_description>Title : Production patient-specific simulator endovascular aneurysm repair training . Clinics Hospital S達o Paulo University Medical School Introduction The aorta aneurysm common clinical condition implies considerable threatening life patient . Before year 2000 , 99 % abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) repair perform open surgery . Nevertheless , Catheter-based minimally invasive intervention rapidly become preferred initial treatment patient vascular disease . After 2004 , endovascular treatment AAA increase 52 % . This change venue require shift approach training fellows well general surgical resident exposure vascular surgery . Currently , supervise training progressive exposure procedure norm . Nevertheless , simulation base training may allow shorten learn curve avoid exposure patient unnecessary risk . Using rapid prototyping possible build model flexible material helpful training surgeon simulate surgical procedure realistic manner . The possibility train surgical procedure general well patient-specific procedure might improve surgeon 's ability result . Rapid prototyping model allow intensive training young surgeon , e.g. , endovascular stent implantation simulate vivo condition real tissue without risk patient complication exposure surgeon radiation biologic risk . After adequately trained model , surgeon feel confident go operating room actual surgery . Besides , pre-operative simulation specific complex surgery provide unique opportunity employ surgical step order determine best operating strategy . Simulators catheter-based intervention available approximately 5 year , technology evolve rapidly . Currently , simulator expensive access limit . The ultimate test simulation demonstrate performance improve operate room . To end , design randomize prospective study describe creation patient-specific simulator train endovascular infra-renal aneurysm correction analyze effect simulator training performance vascular surgery resident . Objectives : Primary : Production patient-specific simulator train endovascular infra-renal aneurysm repair . Secondary : Analyze effect simulator training performance vascular surgery resident . Methods : Production patient-specific simulator : The process chain production three-dimensional rapid prototype model consist follow three step : Image acquisition , Image post-processing 3D printing . Patients undergo angioCT , slice thickness 1mm . Acquired data save common DICOM format ( Digital Imaging Communications Medicine ) . Dedicated high performance workstation equip post-processing tool use process DICOM image generate acquisition . The DICOM data transform STL ( Surface Tesselation Language ) file format . The 3D machine read data CAD draw lay successive layer liquid , powder , sheet material , way build model series cross section . With , patient-specific pulsatile model produce . Analyze effect simulator training performance vascular surgery resident : The study perform period two year ( 2014 2015 ) , Clinics Hospital S達o Paulo University Medical School . All endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) perform time analyze . According average number EVAR service , calculate research include least 60 patient . Ten vascular surgery resident course last year practice randomize 2 group ( total number resident service ) . Inclusion Criteria : - Patients infra-renal aneurysm diameter 5,5cm - Residents last year vascular surgery Clinics Hospital S達o Paulo University Medical School Exclusion Criteria : - Patients suitable endovascular aneurysm repair - Patients iliac aneurysm require iliac bifurcate graft - Residents n't want participate - Group 1 ( 30 patients/5residents ) : patient undergo endovascular aneurysm repair accord hospital routine . The resident perform procedure supervision senior surgeon . It observational part study , already do year 2014 . - Group 2 ( 30 patients/5residents ) : patient aneurysm impressed 3D printing . The senior vascular surgeon resident group able practice procedure model many time wish surgery . After training , EVAR perform accord routine hospital . During surgery , objective parameter analyze : radioscopy time , volume contrast inject , total procedure time , number catheter guide-wires use , technical success . The patient follow leave hospital . Morbidity ( myocardial infarction , renal failure , pulmonary complication ) mortality peri-operative time ( 30 day ) analyze . The surgeon answer questionnaire experience . The data two group compare . This study approve national ethic committee .</detailed_description>
