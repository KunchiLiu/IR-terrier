	<brief_summary>Short Rationale : Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy ( RRSO ) mainstay prevent ovarian cancer BRCA1/2 mutation carrier , ovarian cancer screen ineffective detecting ovarian cancer early curable stage . Women underwent RRSO experience bothersome menopausal symptom worsen sexual functioning relate acute surgical menopause . Hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) mitigate RRSO induce menopausal complaint , however reduce complaint premenopausal level sexual symptom alleviate . Mindfulness intervention find improve sexual functioning alleviate menopausal symptoms various population . It investigate whether mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) effective mitigate RRSO-induced menopausal complaint BRCA1/2 mutation carrier effect sustain longer period time . Objective : To examine effect MBSR training menopause-specific quality life BRCA1/2 mutation carrier experience RRSO-induced menopausal complaint . Study population : Female BRCA1/2 mutation carrier younger 52 year time RRSO report two moderate severe menopause related complaint undergo RRSO . Study design : Prospective randomized control trial follow-up time twelve month conduct University Medical Center Groningen ( UMCG ) Intervention : Eight-week MBSR training consist weekly class two half hour full retreat day . Furthermore participant ask practice mindfulness exercise home 45 minute , six day week . Main study parameters/endpoints : Menopause specific quality life score measure Menopause-specific quality life questionnaire ( MENQOL ) . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : There risk associate take part MBSR training filling questionnaire use study . The content questionnaire concern intimate matter could consider burdensome . A possible benefit participant MBSR training participant able cope complaint RRSO . The group relatedness reflect fact RRSO specifically perform woman hereditary risk ovarian cancer BRCA1/2 mutation carrier .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES This study evaluate effectiveness mindfulness-based intervention alleviate RRSO-induced menopausal complaint BRCA1/2 mutation carrier . The intervention test MBSR training . The investigator hypothesize woman MBSR group report statistically significantly great improvement menopause-specific quality life baseline twelve week compare control group improvement maintain six month twelve month . The investigator also hypothesize woman MBSR group report statistically significantly great improvement sexual functioning decrease sexual distress baseline twelve week compare control group improvement maintain six twelve month . The primary objective examine effect MBSR training menopause-specific quality life BRCA1/2 mutation carrier experience RRSO-induced menopausal complaint . The secondary objective examine effect MBSR training sexual functioning distress BRCA1/2 mutation carrier experience RRSO-induced menopausal complaint . STUDY DESIGN The study prospective , randomize control trial , intervention group receive eight-week MBSR training well care usual control group receive care usual . All participant ask fill questionnaire regard menopausal sexual complaint baseline randomization ( T0 ) twelve week ( T1 ) , six ( T2 ) twelve month ( T3 ) randomization . The study conduct family cancer clinic UMCG . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The two treatment arm summarize baseline frequency categorical variable mean , range SDs continuous variable . Scores MenQOL , FSFI FSDS calculate accord publish score algorithm . A linear mixed effect analysis perform relationship MenQOL score intervention . The score MenQOL 12 week , 6 month 12 month model function treatment arm , time moment , interaction . An unstructured correlation matrix assume , unless data indicate presence another correlation structure . If group unbalance , covariates added model . All analysis conduct intention-to-treat basis . All analysis perform SPSS . Similar analysis conduct FSFI FSDS , use secondary outcome measure .</detailed_description>
