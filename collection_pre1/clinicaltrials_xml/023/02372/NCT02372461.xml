	<brief_summary>The relative benefit risk antibiotic therapy WHO define fast breathe pneumonia pre-school child resource limit setting controversial individual public health level . Most infection viral self-limiting non-selective drug treatment contribute global epidemic antibiotic resistance . There high quality trial evidence manage child fast breathe community setting WHO call evidence update guidance . The investigator propose non inferiority trial compare standard antibiotic treatment placebo poor urban slum setting South Asia address deficit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Amoxicillin Versus Placebo ( Fast Breathing ) Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pneumonia major cause illness death child low-income country . With view decrease death pneumonia , World Health Organization UNICEF develop Integrated Management Childhood Illness ( IMCI ) algorithm simplifies management common childhood illness pneumonia diarrhea different level severity determine appropriate case management primary healthcare provider . Many pneumonia case categorize non-severe pneumonia ( define fast breathe specify age cut-off respiratory rate ) . As incomplete information regard cause type `` pneumonia '' primary care setting , treatment guideline WHO dictate culture information hospital pneumonia case different severity cause . Current WHO guideline advocate use oral antibiotic fast breathe pneumonia . However , postulate fast breathe pneumonia require hospitalization viral etiology , thus require antibiotic treatment . The cost antibiotic treatment child pneumonia high ; estimate US $ 200 million South Asia &amp; sub Saharan Africa alone . Since 60 % pneumonia classify non-severe ( fast breathing ) , put strain already under-sourced programme low-income country . Giving antibiotic confer benefit also put child risk side effect increase risk antimicrobial resistance community . This uncertainty form basis propose study . Investigators propose show clinical trial outcome child diagnose WHO define fast breathe pneumonia similar regardless whether receive antibiotic . This study conduct five primary health care center locate low income community Karachi , Pakistan , extensive trial experience . Children identify fast breathe without danger sign randomize receive either three day WHO recommend oral antibiotic ( amoxicillin 250mg/5ml use WHO weight band ) match placebo ( drug taste look like amoxicillin active ingredient ) study physician work primary health center . The assignment antibiotic amoxicillin placebo child do use computer generate randomization list manner end trial , equal number child arm trial . Based statistical calculation sample size , investigator need assign 1214 child receive amoxicillin number child receive placebo . All child receive antibiotic placebo supervision primary health care physician morning . Evening dos deliver locally hire Community Health Workers ( CHWs ) visit child home . All child assess day 3 study physician see child 's present sign high respiratory rate resolve . All child persistently high respiratory rate and/or development new clinical sign indicate illness progression label treatment failure . There invariably child treatment failure treatment arm ; investigator hypothesize equal number treatment failure group i.e . around 5 % .</detailed_description>
