	<detailed_description>Dysmenorrhoea define painful menstruation . It divide primary secondary dysmenorrhoea accord pathophysiology . Primary dysmenorrhoea severe menstrual pain , occur short time menarche without pelvic pathology . Secondary dysmenorrhoea severe menstrual pain occurs relate pelvic pathology . In primary dysmenorrhoea , pain usually begin menstruation end 48-72 hour . Pain usually felt low abdomen lumbosacral region . Fatigue , headache , vomit , diarrhea constipation may accompany primary dysmenorrhoea . It difficult determine incidence etiology dysmenorrhoea variety criterion use diagnosis dysmenorrhoea subjective symptom . But current study show primary dysmenorrhoea common gynecological problem affect majority woman . Tu et al . indicated prevalence primary dysmenorrhoea 20-90 % percent 15 % case severe symptom . Although etiology primary dysmenorrhoea fully understood , excessive prostaglandin production believe cause abnormal uterine activity . Hyperalgesia present especially deep tissue menstrual cycle . Various approach propose treatment patient dysmenorrhoea . These medical treatment ( example paracetamol , NSAID , oral contraceptive ) , alternative treatment ( example herbal product nutritional supplement , dietary change ) , surgical treatment physiotherapy rehabilitation approach . Connective tissue manipulation ( CTM ) , physiotherapy rehabilitation approach , found German physiotherapist Elizabeth Dicke 1929 . CTM manual reflex therapy , produce autonomic response via cutaneous-visceral reflex . This safe effective technique consist short long traction , perform patient ' skin skilled experienced physiotherapist . Although effect mechanism CTM fully understand yet , know treatment method stimulate autonomic nervous system rebalance parasympathetic sympathetic function . CTM produce autonomic stimulus stroke perform skin blood vessel stimulate autonomic nerve ending locate tissue interface . It also find stimulation autonomic nerve ending may result reduction sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone lead vasodilatation . Stimulation skin stroke affect segmental reflex . It known stimulation segmental reflex use treatment organ dysfunction . CTM apply affected dermatome generates reflex effect associate organ , provide heal increase circulation decrease pain . Skin alteration subcutaneous tissue tension observe dermatome myotomes , innervate spinal cord level malfunction organ . In addition effect , powerful stimulation cutaneous mechanoreceptor induces gate control mechanism , increase pain threshold decrease stress hormone muscle tension . The aim study investigate effect connective tissue manipulation pain threshold woman primary dysmenorrhoea . According literature , study measure pain threshold . But randomize control trial explore short long-term effect connective tissue manipulation primary dysmenorrhoea . Hypothesis study connective tissue manipulation increase pain threshold decrease severity pain woman suffer primary dysmenorrhoea .</detailed_description>
