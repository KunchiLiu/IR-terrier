	<brief_title>Transcutaneous Bilirubinometry Neonates With BiliCare System Compared Invasive TSB Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia newborn jaundice impact 85 % newborn [ 1 ] . Regardless mechanism , excessive hyperbilirubinemia traditionally treat phototherapy minimize probable risk develop bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity . However , earlier recent data suggest pre-discharge bilirubin screen risk significant hyperbilirubinemia , whether due rapid bilirubin production earlier age onset , impact guideline clinical use phototherapy [ 1 , 2 ] . In study , plan test performance novel transcutaneous device ( BiliCareTM ) first screen bilirubin level postnatal age 6 48 hr ; possibly also , substitute use measurement total plasma/serum bilirubin ( TB ) . This device apply novel light transmission technology potential measure bilirubin point-of-care test subcutaneous tissue , use internal algorithm calculate bilirubin level skin . In proposalstudy , assess clinical performance BiliCare correlate measurement make device near-concurrent measure total plasma/serum bilirubin normative range ( mean , median , range inter-quartile range ) term late-preterm newborn ( include at-risk jaundice / administer phototherapy ) born family diverse race ethnic background .</detailed_description>
