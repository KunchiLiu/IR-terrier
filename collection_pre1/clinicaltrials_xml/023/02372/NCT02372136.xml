	<brief_summary>In preterm infant feed human milk , milk need fortified meet nutrient recommendation . Fortification 1 ) standard , 2 ) individualize ( adjust base daily human milk nutrient analysis milk volume ) , 3 ) optimize ( adjust base growth rate serum analysis ) . The first specific aim determine whether individualized optimized nutrition hospitalization result improve growth neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) extremely low gestational age ( GA ) neonates ( ELGANs , &lt; 29 week ) small GA ( SGA , birth weight &lt; 10th percentile GA ) preterm infant compare optimized nutrition . The second specific aim determine whether individualized optimized nutrition NICU improve neurodevelopmental outcome ( acquisition development milestone ) reduces risk disproportionate growth ( i.e. , excess fat ) NICU finding suggestive metabolic syndrome first 3 year life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Individual Nutrition Preterm Very Low Birth Weight Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses : 1 . Primary hypothesis : In preterm infant ( GA &lt; 29 week GA &lt; 35 week SGA ) individualize optimized nutrition increase velocity growth ( weight gain velocity 2 g x kg-1 x day-1 length velocity 0.2 cm per week ) birth 36 week postmenstrual age ( GA plus postnatal age ) discharge ( whichever come first ) comparison optimize nutrition . 2 . Secondary hypothesis : Individualized optimize nutrition improve neurodevelopmental outcome reduce risk disproportionate growth ( excess fat ) NICU finding suggestive metabolic syndrome first 3 year life . Study design : Double-blinded randomized control trial ( RCT ) : After consent , 150 neonate randomize one two group . Study intervention : Patients randomize either : 1 . Control : optimize nutrition : Milk fortification base current recommendation optimize adjustment nutrient week base blood level urea nitrogen albumin velocity growth ( weight length ) . 2 . Intervention : Individualized optimized nutrition : Milk fortification optimize control neonate . In addition , nutrition individualized every day . Milk fortification adjust base daily measurement macronutrients human milk use near-infrared analysis . Randomization do computer provide statistician use random block allocation stratification GA size age ( AGA 23-28 week , SGA 23-28 week SGA 29-34 week ) . Twins multiple randomize arm study .</detailed_description>
