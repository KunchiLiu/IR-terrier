	<brief_summary>Patients hip , knee shoulder PJI , treat two-stage exchange Revision . Patients randomize 2 group : experimental Group get reimplantation short interval ( 2-3 week ) control Group long standard interval . Primary objective study `` Infection outcome '' . The infection-free status define absence clinical ( e.g . fistula ) , laboratory ( e.g . normal C-reactive protein ) radiological sign infection ( e.g . septic loosening ) . Secondary objective `` Functional outcome '' .The functional assessment perform use joint-specific score ( HARRIS HIP SCORE , CONSTANT SHOULDER SCORE , KNEE SOCIETY SCORE , OXFORD HIP SCORE , OXFORD KNEE SCORE , QUICK DASH SCORE ) involve range motion ( ROM ) , patient mobility / independency daily life , subjective evaluation pain use visual analog pain scale ( 1-10 point ) life-quality evaluation ( EQ5D5L score ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Interval Treatment PJI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A two-stage prosthesis exchange long interval ≥6 week consider `` gold standard '' management prosthetic joint infection ( PJI ) . We compare efficacy safety novel surgical approach short interval 2-3 week ( `` fast-track '' ) compare standard long interval 6-10 week . Included patient hip , knee shoulder PJI , prosthetic component remove ; exclude patient treated prosthesis retention one-stage exchange PJI cause difficult-to-treat organism . Patients randomize short versus long interval surgical procedure , use standard antibiotic regimen 12 week study arm . The recruitment period multicenter treatment/outcome trial 24 month , follow-up period 12 month calculate sample size 418 patient ( i.e . 209 patient study arm ) . Primary endpoint infection outcome , secondary endpoint functional outcome , define establish score joint-specific score , pain quality life score . The expected outcome short interval ( `` fast-track '' ) arm ( ) improve infection outcome ( i.e . long infection-free period less treatment-related adverse event ) ; ( ii ) improve functional outcome , ( iii ) reduce healthcare expense . In addition , pharmacokinetic study perform biobank microbes biological sample establish . This study high clinical relevance increase public health challenge relate device-associated infection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects age ≥18 year hip , knee shoulder PJI , prosthetic component remove . The standard treatment systemic local antibiotic follow ( predetermined algorithm ) . Subjects willing participate study ( sign inform consent ) comply plan followup assessment ( 3 , 6 12 month study inclusion ) . Treatment debridement prosthesis retention ( e.g . perform early postoperative acute hematogenous infection symptom duration &lt; 3 week ) onestage exchange . PJI cause difficulttotreat organism , include rifampinresistant staphylococci , quinoloneresistant Gramnegative bacillus fungi . Subject previously enrol study currently enrol another competitive investigational study .</criteria>
