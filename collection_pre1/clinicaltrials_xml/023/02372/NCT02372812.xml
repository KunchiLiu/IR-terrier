	<brief_title>Analgesic Effects Of Dexamethasone ; Its Use To Reduce Post Operative Pain Scores</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RESEARCH QUESTION TO BE ADDRESSED BY THIS RESEARCH Does intraoperative dexamethasone 12mg reduce 24 hour post-operative pain score adult patient undergo elective laparotomy , thyroidectomy mastectomy Mulago hospital RATIONALE FOR THE RESEARCH The treatment acute post-operative pain important health care issue . Inspite , treatment widely recognise past two decade . A variety cultural , attitudinal , religious , educational , political logistical reason attribute variety physiological psychological side effect pain . Dexamethasone cheap readily available drug Uganda show analgesic property . However , study do assess analgesic effect majorly tonsillectomy cardiac surgery . A study do general surgery patient . Most study do outside Africa yet demonstrate positive result regard optimise analgesia reduce post-operative opioid requirement patient . This study yet do Uganda available literature may necessarily apply set . GENERAL OBJECTIVE To study effect intraoperative dexamethasone 12 mg versus placebo 24 hour post-operative pain score adult patient undergo elective laparotomy , mastectomy thyroidectomy Mulago hospital . SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To compare 24 hour post-operative pain score intraoperative dexamethasone 12mg versus placebo adult patient undergo elective laparotomy , mastectomy thyroidectomy Mulago hospital . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE To compare adverse event associate intraoperative dexamethasone 12mg versus placebo adult patient undergo elective laparotomy , mastectomy thyroidectomy Mulago hospital . METHODS Study design : phase 2 prospective randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled trial Study site : Mulago National Refferal Hospital . Study population : Adult patient undergo elective laparotomy , mastectomy thyroidectomy Mulago hospital , meet inclusion criterion consent participate study . Inclusion criterion : Patients schedule mastectomy , laparotomy thyroidectomy give informed consent participate , ASA I &amp; II , patient none mild moderate systemic illness , Adult patient , 18 year old . Exclusion criterion : Patients Cushing 's disease Cushing 's syndrome , Patients diabetes mellitus , Systemic infection , Previous history TB infection . Randomization : block randomization Blinding : double blind Sample size : 170 patient Study procedure : 1 . Premedication consist midazolam fentanyl . 2 . Anaesthesia induce use intravenous propofol thiopental . 3 . Maintenance anaesthesia do use inhalation anaesthesia i.e isoflurane sevoflurane . 4 . The intervention ( dexamethasone placebo ) give 15 minute follow induction anaesthesia . 5 . 30 minute prior end procedure , opioid ( morphine ) give intravenously post operative pain management immediate post operative period . 6 . Post-operative pain manage use tramadol pethidine . 7 . Breakthrough pain manage use intravenous diclofenac drug choice intravenous paracetamol tolerate opioids . 8 . The patient ' pain score assess post anaesthesia care unit discharge parent ward . 9 . A research assistant allocate patient ward , ensure timely administration analgesia well management breakthrough pain . 10 . The pain score assess 12 24 hour , research assistant train administer numerical rating scale . Their pain score assess use tool adverse reaction assess . RISKS OR BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS This minimal risk study . There demonstrated risk drug dos . All patient might react drug eliminate study . COMPENSATION/REIMBURSEMENT No patient expect pay study . Patients reimburse participate study . CONSENT inform consent sought patient prior surgery . CONFIDENTIALITY ASSURANCES Patient names patient number collect order ensure utmost confidentiality . The data collect safely store multiple soft copy storage device separate place , questionnaire .</detailed_description>
