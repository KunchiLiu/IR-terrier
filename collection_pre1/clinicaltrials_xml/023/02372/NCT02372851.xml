	<brief_title>Assessing Effectiveness Water Filter Technology Arsenic Mitigation Strategy West Bengal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Unilever Pureit As+ filter assess chemical microbiological performance health impact use parallel , household-randomised control trial ( RCT ) design four-month follow-up period . This study follow open ( non-blinded ) design filtration technology particularly challenge blind ( Boisson et al. , 2010 ) . Equal randomisation apply ( i.e . 1:1 ) . Randomisation undertaken lottery organise participating village . The study undertaken two phase ; initial phase involve baseline survey identify affected community . Those household identify eligible baseline survey randomise intervention control group intervention distribute . After 2-4 week adaptation period , control intervention arm follow monthly visit period four month . The baseline study collect information demographic , sanitation facility , hygiene practice , drink water source treatment practice , diet household member , knowledge arsenic contamination arsenicosis , factor could potentially impact outcomes interest . Additionally , data behavioural factor observe associated Household Water Treatment ( HWT ) use collect predict intervention use intervention arm . During baseline survey , water sample source water store drinking water collect tested total thermotolerant coliforms ( TTC ) total arsenic concentration . The female head household invite provide sample urine total urinary arsenic testing . The female head household follow expected household member i. mainly responsible drinking water management , ii . home day thus make logistically feasible obtain spot urine sample throughout study . At monthly interval , participate household visit assess filter use use self report well objective indicator . Additionally , round follow-up , drink water sample take participate household microbiological arsenic testing . Additionally , female head household invite provide spot urine sample total urinary arsenic round follow . For arsenic testing sample store drinking water collect analysed total arsenic . Additionally , intervention household , sample source water also collect assess percentage removal Arsenic Pureit AS+ filter . Water sample collect polyethylene bottle pre-washed nitric acid water nitric acid ( 0.1 % v/v ) add collection laboratory preservative ( Roychowdhury , 2008 ) . Samples store ice box arrival lab store 4°C shipment laboratory analysis . Total water arsenic measure Flow Injection Hydride Generation Atomic Absorption Spectrometry ( FI-HG-AAS ) Inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) . For microbiological testing , round follow-up , intervention household water sample collect i. store drinking water ( whether intervention filter another container ) , ii . 25 % random sample , sample also take influent water ( source water ) effluent water filter ( keep drinking water elsewhere ) . For control household , water sample collect i. store drinking water , ii . 25 % random sample , water source . Untreated drinking water collect determine technology performance compare effluent influent water quality . For stored drinking water , householder ask drinking water house moment sample collect vessel householder identifies main container use moment fill cup glass drinking . All sample microbial analysis collect sterile Whirl-Pak™ bag contain tablet sodium thiosulfate neutralize disinfectant . Samples place ice process within 4-6 hour collection ass TTC level . Microbiological assessment perform use DelAgua field incubator ( University Surrey ) accordance Standard Methods ( Eaton et al. , 2005 ) . Acceptability major limitation filtration technology assess final follow-up visit . The acceptability technology evaluate conduct household survey , in-depth interview ( IDI ) focus group discussion ( FGDs ) . A subsample male female head household ask participate FGDs end study provide feedback technology include perceive benefit limitation .</detailed_description>
