	<brief_summary>The aim randomize trial detect whether use Sildenafil citrate therapy increase amniotic fluid volume express term amniotic fluid index measure via ultrasound fetus pregnancy complicate oligohydramnios , compare outcomes Sildenafil-treated pregnancy similar pregnancy remain Sildenafil-naïve .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sildenafil Citrate Therapy Oligohydramnios</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women refer maternity ward hospital checkup inclusion criterion offer admission least 24 hour complete rest aim increase placental blood circulation uterus , improve amniotic fluid level . Patients randomly allocate two group accord trial sequence determine via computer generate random table . The trial sequence hidden opaque sequence envelope envelope contain assignment single patient . Patients first group receive 2 liter isotonic saline intravenous infusion period 4 hour use rate 250 ml per hour addition sildenafil citrate therapy ( Viagra® ) 25 mg 3 time daily fluid regimen use control group without sildenafil citrate treatment . During hospital course maternal monitoring do use maternal vital sign early detection manifestation fluid overload fetal monitoring do use non-stress test patient less 34 complete week receive dexamethasone total dose 24mg enhance fetal lung maturity case expedite delivery need . Fasting also recommend fluid therapy case emergency interference require patient resume usual daily diet fluid intake . All patient undergo sonography 24 hour reassessment amniotic fluid index show improvement least 20 % discharge home still show result regimen repeat . Discharged patient first group ask continue sildenafil citrate therapy ( Viagra® ) 25 mg 3 time daily plus daily oral fluid intake 2 liter control group ask 2 liter daily oral fluid . Outpatient monitoring group depend twice weekly non-stress test weekly amniotic fluid index biophysical profile . Readmission inpatient therapy use protocol group indicate time amniotic fluid index reduce ≤ 5 cm . All patient also instruct undergo period bed rest , also educate count fetal kick report immediately hospital unsatisfactory . Patients group monitor till go spontaneous labor till delivery indicate . The primary outcome measure value amniotic fluid index therapy group group . The secondary outcome measure mode delivery , gestational age birth , fetal birth weight , fetal neonatal outcome ( Apgar score , umbilical artery acid-base analysis birth , need transfer neonatal intensive care unit ) analyze study control group .</detailed_description>
