	<detailed_description>Benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) prevalent entity , affect 50 % men old 60 years.3 The clinical picture disease include low urinary tract symptom interrupt weak urinary stream , nocturia , urgency leak even sexual dysfunction individual . Medical therapy usually first-line treatment . However , efficacy drug like alpha-blocker limited , disease progress invasive treatment option take consideration . In case moderate severe low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) monopolar transurethral resection prostate ( TUR-P ) standard treatment . Especially frail patient , conventional TUR-P associate relevant potentially deleterious complication . The proportion elderly patient anticoagulation antiplatelet therapy cardial comorbidities increase . Especially major bleed transurethral resection syndrome ( TUR syndrome ) put high-risk patient relevant perioperative risk . TUR syndrome cause absorption electrolyte-free irrigating fluid ( used monopolar TUR-P ) , consist symptom circulatory nervous system . Mild form common often go undiagnosed , severe form TUR syndrome potentially life-threatening . Using isotonic saline , like bipolar TUR-P transurethral laser vaporization ( TUV-P ) , TUR syndrome prevent . Moreover , technique think completely prevent influx irrigation fluid vascular system due excellent coagulation property . However , ZÃ¼rich study group demonstrate bipolar resection prostate Greenlight-Laser , significant intraoperative fluid absorption occur . The author emphasize , care must take use procedure patient significant cardiovascular comorbidities , large volume influx patient significant cardiac comorbidities could result dangerous complication . Ethanol monitoring first use late 1980 's alternative traditional method measure fluid absorption ( i.e . measure volumetric fluid balance serum sodium concentration ) . These technique , however , bothersome must carry meticulously yield valid figure absorption . If tracer amount ethanol add irrigation fluid , volume fluid absorb estimated amount ethanol measure patient ' exhale breath . The expired-breath ethanol technique establish method investigate intra operative absorption irrigation fluid . Ethanol 1 % added conventional isotonic 0.9 % saline use intra-operative irrigation . The absorption irrigation fluid estimate measure end-expiratory ethanol concentration alcometer . During last year , Thulium laser emerge alternative type laser , combine best feature perform vaporisation technique : Thulium laser wavelength 2013 nm , target chromophore water . The energy Thulium laser high tissue absorption rate , produce effective vaporisation scant depth remain tissue . As property water remain unaltered reach boil point , effect laser tissue remain constant throughout surgical procedure . The short-term complication rate Thulium laser similar rate describe vaporisation laser system less TUR-P . Thus , Thulium vaporisation prostate establish standard procedure many urological department include . Despite recent publication safety complication Thulium vaporisation prostate , investigator knowledge , , prospective trial directly assess , whether absorption irrigation fluid occur extent Thulium Laser vaporisation prostate . The investigator therefore aim investigate absorption irrigation fluid occur Thulium Laser vaporisation prostate expire breath ethanol test .</detailed_description>
