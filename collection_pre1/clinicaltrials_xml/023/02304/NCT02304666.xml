	<brief_summary>Inflammatory Bowel disease ( IBD ) include Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis . IBD 's precise origin unknown . Today , current hypothesis disease pathogenesis IBD result dysregulated mucosal immune response gut microbial flora genetically susceptible host . The intestinal homeostasis depend interaction immune epithelial cell . Epithelial cell first line defense , tightly connect underlying gut associate lymphoid tissue alteration result loss tissue homeostasis . Vanin-1 ( Vnn1 mice , VNN1 human ) epithelial pantheinase regulate cell response stress . This ectoenzyme hydrolyse vitamin B5-derivative pantetheine provide cysteamine tissue regenerate pantothenate . Previous study show Vnn1 KO mouse resistant experimental colitis administration cystamine ( oxidized form cysteamine ) restore susceptibility colitis . Furthermore , analysis VNN1 expression IBD patient show high VNN1 expression associate severe clinical feature . Thus , analysis VNN1 expression could represent good prognostic marker . In recent publish article , characterize among retrospective cohort 500 IBD patient control new SNPs ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) VNN1 promoter show association IBD incidence high VNN1 expression . This suggest VNN1gene might new predisposition marker IBD . In mouse , Vnn1 expression tightly regulate activation PPARa PPARg transcription factor . Interestingly , one SNPs identify patient participates PPARg bind site . Interestingly , drug relate family 5-ASA commonly use IBD , PPARgamma agonist potential . Therefore , quantify VNN1 level patient 5-ASA therapy might help predict response therapy select patient high benefit therapy . The purpose new project extend initial analysis . The study prospective , monocentric control . Its primary objective evaluate level VNN1 expression colonic mucosa IBD patient control subject confirm correlation high VNN1 expression IBD . In relation prospective nature , also try associate VNN1 expression level specific endophenotypes ( severity and/or localization lesion , quality response therapy ) . Finally , screen patient previously identify SNPs integrate information interpretation result expression analysis . This study plan 2 year . Two group patient constitute : one group include IBD patient follow `` Service de Gastro-entérologie du Pr Grimaud à l'Hôpital Nord `` group constitute control cohort include person propose screen colonoscopy familial history colon cancer polyp , Irritable Bowel Syndrome . The investigator fill questionnaire include patient , collect information age , sex , past medical history , take medicine , digestive symptom colonoscopy indication . IBD patient first set biopsy ( n = 10 ) blood sample collect general anesthesia colonoscopy plan IBD usual follow-up ; second set similar sample collect within next 12 month endoscopic control medically justify . The control subject one set biopsy blood sample collect general anesthesia colonoscopy . In particular case IBD patient require surgery , small piece resection collect ex-vivo healthy pathologic area . The blood sample serve quantification VNN1 seric pantheteinase activity SNP 's genetic study . The colonic biopsy obtain duplicate 5 different ileocolonic area , one histopathological analysis transcriptional analysis qRT-PCR . The surgical sample use transcriptional activity , tissue pantheteinase activity constitution TMA ( Tissue MicroArrays ) bank immunohistochemistry . Expected benefit validate new IBD prognostic marker disease severity potentially evaluation therapeutic response .</brief_summary>
