	<brief_title>Comparison Between Laparoscopic Ovarian Diathermy Urinary Purified FSH Women With Clomiphene Citrate Resistant Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) common endocrine disorder reproductive age , incidence 5 -10 % . Classically clomiphene citrate ( CC ) first approach induce ovulation patient PCOS . Although 70-80 % PCOS woman ovulate treatment CC , 40 % PCOS woman become pregnant . Women ovulate increase dos CC describe CC-resistant remain major challenge gynecologic endocrinology . Traditional alternative CC-resistant patient include gonadotropin therapy laparoscopic ovarian diathermy . Gonadotropin therapy widely use ovulation induction CC-resistant PCOS patient . The use purify FSH preparation virtually free LH activity , recommendable treatment since evidence pure FSH may significantly reduce tonic LH level , favourably alter intraovarian hormonal milieu , promote initial follicular development minimal risk multiple follicular growth ovarian hyperstimulation . The use metformin PCOS associate cycle regulation , improve ovulation , reduction circulate androgen level ( 5 ) . Metformin likely play role improve ovulation induction woman PCOS variety action , include reduce insulin level alter effect insulin ovarian androgen biosynthesis , theca cell proliferation , endometrial growth . In addition , potentially direct effect , inhibit ovarian gluconeogenesis thus reduce ovarian androgen production . Laparoscopic ovarian drilling ( LOD ) avoid reduce need gonadotropin ovulation induction . Several potential mechanism action LOD also suggest . The reduction inhibin production follow LOD follow increase FSH secretion recruitment new cohort follicle . Other theory restoration normal production putative gonadotropin surge laparoscopic ovarian electrocautery . Moreover , drainage androgen inhibin follicle surface may inhibit excessive collagenisation overlie ovarian cortex facilitate Softening ovarian tunica . Neighbouring follicle undergo atresia may mature gain access ovarian surface , facilitate ovulation . Initiation normal inhibin B pulsatility LOD appear correlate postoperative onset ovulatory cycle ( 3 ) . The main drawback LOD adhesion formation ovarian atrophy . That minimise number diathermy point avoid diathermy near ovarian hilum recommend . All woman clomiphene resistant PCOS attend subfertility clinic Cairo university hospital invite participate study . PCOS diagnosis base chronic anovulation sonographic picture polycystic ovary ( 8 ) . Clomiphene resistance define failure ovulation spite receive 150mg clomiphene citrate 5 day menstrual cycle . Exclusion criterion age &gt; 40 year , cause infertility , hyperprolactinaemia , allergy FSH metformin , previous FSH LOD therapy , body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 35 . The study explain participant write informed consent obtain participation . Full history take follow complete examination sonographic evaluation . Sonographic picture polycystic ovary define least 12 follicle 2-9mm ovary and/or ovarian volume &gt; 10cm3 . 210 woman clomiphene resistant PCOS randomly divide 3 equal group use computer generate random number . Group 1 receive combine metformin FSH , group 2 LOD group 3 act control group intervention . Group 1 receive urinary purify FSH ( Fostimon速 IBSA , Switzerland ) 75IU daily 7 day start 3rd day menstruation progesterone withdrawal bleeding . If follicle exceed 9mm dose increase 37.5IU every 7 day . The cycle cancel follicle exceed 9mm 4 week start FSH . This combined oral metformin ( Cidophage速 CID , Egypt ) 500 mg tds . Group 2 LOD ovary stabilise grasp ovarian ligament monopolar diathermy use 4-10 puncture ovary . The number puncture individualise accord size ovary . Serial vaginal ultrasound scan do start 10th day menstruation , frequency monitoring individualize accord woman 's response . When dominant follicle reach 17mm either group , woman receive Human chorionic gonadotrophin ( Choriomon速 IBSA , Switzerland ) 5000IU timed intercourse advise 36 hour later . Group 3 regular progesterone withdrawal bleed form norethisterone ( stereonate速 Hi Pharm , Egypt ) .</detailed_description>
