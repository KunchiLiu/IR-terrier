	<brief_title>The Use 3D Surface Imaging Objective Assessment Breast Conserving Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BCT common breast surgical oncological procedure perform approximately 28,500 patient undergoing operation every year . In breast cancer surgery , primary aim remove cancer must reconcile secondary aim preserve breast aesthetic . Objective analysis cosmetic outcome measure breast surgery lacking , however 3D surface image begin show promise area . Having robust tool objective assessment outcome may facilitate critical appraisal technique therefore surgeon learn . Currently cosmetic success operation subjectively evaluate patient ' surgeon ' visual assessment . Patient report outcome measure ( PROMs ) instrument measure aspect patient 's health status . Various PROMs use evaluate patient ' satisfaction breast cancer treatment . For example , BREAST-Q develop quantitatively qualitatively measure patient ' perception breast reconstruction examine quality life domain ( psychosocial well-being , physical well-being , sexual well-being ) satisfaction domain ( satisfaction breast , satisfaction outcome , satisfaction care ) . When use PROMs , accuracy reproducibility measurable ; result subjective view patient . While patient opinion appearance clearly important outcome local oncological control , purpose objective comparison group patient , surgeon time , independent clinician ( / lay people ) may recruit perform 'panel assessment ' photographs various aspect cosmesis breast shape , size cleavage consider addition overall appearance . However assessment still subjective often lack accuracy reproducibility . There many attempt derive objective measure outcome . In 1970 's , Edstron et al described 'split reverse negative ' photographic negative leave right breast make laid next non-negative right leave breast . The constructed image perfectly symmetrical breast compare original photograph patient ' breast . More recently two software system develop objectively evaluate aesthetic surgical outcome breast surgery use 2D photograph . The Breast Analyzing Tool ( BATÂ© ) evaluate symmetry compare breast area , breast circumference nipple position breast . The Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment cosmetic result ( BCCT.core ) also analyse colour difference scar appearance addition asymmetry calculation . The use 3D surface image clinical set first describe Burke Beard 1967 analyze facial structure . Over last fifteen year 3D image use research clinical tool aesthetic , oncoplastic reconstructive breast surgery . Initial study establish optimal technique obtain image test accuracy reproducibility . 3D image currently use simulate patient cosmetic augmentation might achieve term size shape . It demonstrate simulated image accurate patient felt help choose implant . In term oncoplastic reconstructive surgery 3D surface imaging use objective evaluation cosmetic outcome oncoplastic procedure breast reconstruction lipofilling , however one article publish relate Breast Conserving Therapy ( BCT ) . Moyer et al analyze twenty three patient undergone BCT compare volume asymmetry . They find positive correlation percentage breast parenchyma excise asymmetry . The location cancer , age patient need multiple operation influence cosmetic result sample size small therefore likely underpowered . The aim study ass use 3D surface image tool assessment symmetry outcome follow breast conserve therapy . The result surface image correlate patient satisfaction , use BREAST-Q , validate patient questionnaire correlate panel assessment independent panel two surgeon , one clinical oncologist one breast care nurse .</detailed_description>
