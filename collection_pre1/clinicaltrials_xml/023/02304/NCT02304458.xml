	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose nivolumab give without ipilimumab see well work treat young patient solid tumor sarcomas come back ( recurrent ) respond treatment ( refractory ) . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab ipilimumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . It yet know whether nivolumab work well alone ipilimumab treat patient recurrent refractory solid tumor sarcomas .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab With Without Ipilimumab Treating Younger Patients With Recurrent Refractory Solid Tumors Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine tolerability , define describe toxicity nivolumab administer single agent child relapse refractory solid tumor adult recommend dose 3 mg/kg . II . Determine systemic nivolumab exposure child similar systemic exposure adult follow 3 mg/kg dose . III . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) define describe toxicity nivolumab plus ipilimumab administer child relapse refractory solid tumor . IV . Assess antitumor effect nivolumab across select childhood solid tumor seven expansion cohort ( Parts B1-B6 , B8 ) ; neuroblastoma ( 2 cohort : measurable disease , metaiodobenzylguanidine [ MIBG ] positive non-measurable disease ) , osteosarcoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma , Hodgkin lymphoma , non-Hodgkin lymphoma . V. Assess antitumor effect nivolumab combination ipilimumab across select childhood solid tumor ( Part D ) . VI . Characterize pharmacokinetics nivolumab alone combination ipilimumab , include area curve ( AUC ) , concentration maximum ( Cmax ) , concentration minimum ( Cmin ) , use intensive sampling . VII . Assess immunogenicity nivolumab alone combination ipilimumab measure anti-drug antibody ( ADA ) level . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Conduct exploratory study phenotypic functional effect nivolumab ( alone combination ipilimumab ) , well change antibody previously vaccinate virus , serum sample . II . Explore whether correlation exist program cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression tumor antitumor effect nivolumab ( alone combination ipilimumab ) pediatric solid tumor conduct exploratory study potential tumor associate biomarkers response tumor tissue ( least five follow marker : NRAS , BRAF , MEK , KIT , PDGF , TP53 , RB1 BRCA1 , Akt phosphorylation , IL-17 PD-L1 ) . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study nivolumab follow phase II study . PART A : Patients recurrent refractory solid tumor receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PART B : Patients neuroblastoma , osteosarcoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma , Hodgkin lymphoma , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , melanoma receive nivolumab Part A . PART C : INDUCTION : Patients receive nivolumab IV 60 minute ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive nivolumab IV Part A . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PART D : INDUCTION : Patients neuroblastoma , osteosarcoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma , Hodgkin lymphoma , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , melanoma receive nivolumab IV ipilimumab IV Part C. Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive nivolumab IV Part A . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow approximately 100 day , every 6 month 24 month , annually 60 month .</detailed_description>
