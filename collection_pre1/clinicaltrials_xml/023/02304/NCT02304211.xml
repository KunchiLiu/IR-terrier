	<brief_title>Intra-Arterial Microdosing : Proof-of-Concept Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IAM novel approach combine methodology technique 'microdosing ' 'intra-arterial drug delivery ' test new drug target organ tissue . The main feature approach microdose ( define 1/100th total body minimal pharmacological dose ) give body area 1/100th total body mass - temporary pharmacological concentration generate area may sufficient generate detect biomarker relevant drug 's safety efficacy . The drug return systemically dilute become subpharmacological microdose . The significance approach ability obtain information novel drug human safe manner . Insulin administer radial artery compare systemic administration . The effect ipsilateral hand compare systemic effect effect contralateral hand . The outcomes insulin pharmacokinetics , glucose potassium level , 18F fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) uptake measure Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) imaging .</detailed_description>
