	<brief_summary>Pilot study patient continuous flow leave ventricular assist device ( cfLVAD ) proof feasibility specific individual training home aim increase pulse pressure predefined threshold might attenuate loss arterial wall thickness . Hypothesis : Increasing daily physical activity near normal ( &gt; 10.000 step per day ) pre-defined level pulse pressure ( intensity ) realizable feasible approach investigate change arterial wall thickness cardio-respiratory capacity cfLVAD patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator study 3 cfLVAD patient low pulse pressure work package 1 use two different exercise , treadmill bicycle . Walking cycle present commonly use physical activity applicable individual daily basis . The investigator aim demonstrate individual change pulse pressure type exercise assess cfLVAD patient . In feasibility study ( work package 2 ) investigator enroll 6 cfLVAD patient perform home-based physical activity program include walk defined number step per day predefined speed cycling predefined power [ watt ] bicycle ergometer . The performance patient monitor seven day use wearable activity device .</detailed_description>
