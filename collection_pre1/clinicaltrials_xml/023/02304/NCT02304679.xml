	<detailed_description>The secondary objective study : A . To evaluate erectile function ( EF ) categorical improvement patient receive 4 weekly treatment shockwave therapy versus receive sham treatment , 3 month first sequence treatment . B . To compare improvement erectile function 4 week phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor ( PDE5i ) use 4 weekly treatment shockwave therapy ( `` within patient '' effect ) . C. To compare improvement erectile function 4 week PDE5 inhibitor use 4 weekly treatment sham shock wave therapy ( `` within patient '' effect ) . D. To evaluate effect 2nd sequence 4-8 weekly shock wave treatment 3 month second sequence . E. To evaluate treatment effect ( comparison objectives A , B , C , D ) validate measure EF ( question 2 sexual encounter profile ( SEP2 ) , question 3 sexual encounter profile ( SEP3 ) , Global Assessment Question ( GAQ ) , Erection Hardness Scale ( EHS ) ) , remain domain IIEF score ( orgasmic function , sexual desire , intercourse satisfaction , overall satisfaction ) , well total IIEF score . F. To evaluate treatment tolerance potential adverse event . G. To compare change EF measure time follow-up period 12 month follow second sequence 4 weekly shock wave treatment . H. To compare effect sequence 4 weekly shock wave treatment versus 8 biweekly shock wave treatment 3 month treatment ( `` within patient '' effect ) .</detailed_description>

Preinclusion : The patient agree try engage least 3 sexual intercourse per month period Inclusion : Patient complete 4 week PDE5i treatment , stop treatment additional month . Patient available follow 19 month ( time preinclusion 17 month time inclusion ) The patient participate another interventional study Within past three month , patient participate another interventional study The patient exclusion period determine previous study The patient judicial protection The patient adult guardianship The patient refuse sign consent It impossible correctly inform patient Complete anerection History pelvic cancer surgery ( radical prostatectomy , cystectomy , abdominoperineal resection rectum ) Untreated testosterone deficiency Neurological disease affect central nervous system Untreated psychiatric disease , psychiatric disease may compromise study participation Anatomical malformation penis consider investigator able prevent vaginal penetration Chronic haematological pathology associate risk haemorrhage Oral injectable antiandrogen treatment The patient take blood thinner AND/OR International Normalized Ratio &gt; 3 Known allergy treatment use study ( e.g . Cialis , gel ) Exclusion criterion : The patient contraindication Cialis mention SPC , regiven : Hypersensitivity active substance excipients list section 6.1 SPC . In clinical study , tadalafil show augment hypotensive effect nitrate . This thought result combine effect nitrate tadalafil nitric oxide/cGMP pathway . Therefore , administration CIALIS patient use form organic nitrate contraindicate . ( see section 4.5 SPC ) . CIALIS , must use men cardiac disease sexual activity inadvisable . Physicians consider potential cardiac risk sexual activity patient preexist cardiovascular disease . The following group patient cardiovascular disease include clinical trial use tadalafil therefore contraindicate : patient myocardial infarction within last 90 day , patient unstable angina angina occur sexual intercourse , patient New York Heart Association Class 2 great heart failure last 6 month , patient uncontrolled arrhythmias , hypotension ( &lt; 90/50 mm Hg ) , uncontrolled uncontrolled hypertension , patient stroke within last 6 month . CIALIS contraindicate patient loss vision one eye nonarteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy ( NAION ) , regardless whether episode connection previous PDE5 inhibitor exposure ( see section 4.4 SPC ) .</criteria>
