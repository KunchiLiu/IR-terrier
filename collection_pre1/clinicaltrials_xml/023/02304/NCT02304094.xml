	<brief_title>Morton 's Neuroma : Manipulation Versus Steroid Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proposed Randomised Single Blind Study Aims objectives The aim study establish two treatment option prefer intervention treatment Morton 's Neuroma . Objectives . A systematic review literature shall undertake order inform researcher . The Pressure Threshold Meter shall validate use foot . A randomised control trial shall perform . Steroid injection current gold standard conservative treatment condition . Therefore , manipulation shall compare control group receive steroid injection equality randomise control trial . Outcomes compare use visual analogue pain scale ( VAS ) , The Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire ( MOXFQ ) , The Foot Ankle Ability Measure ( FAAM ) , SF-36 quality life questionnaire algometric pressure threshold test . An improvement either group VAS 20mm group shall consider minimum worthwhile change identify minimum clinically important difference pain treatment group visual analogue pain scale ( Thomson et al . 2013 ) . The primary question ask whether manipulation beneficial treatment MN . Secondary question address , include , benefit manipulation Morton 's neuroma long lasting , out-perform current conservative intervention three month , six month one year . Is PTM accurate reliable measurement tool foot pain ? Furthermore , manipulation result change mechanical load gait see high resolution walkway analysis ? Ethics The main ethical issue ask subject pain accept experimental treatment . The study design way ensure volunteer deny treatment . There also opportunity benefit allocated treatment receive alternative treatment another treatment entirely . Each volunteer shall access standard treatment pathway time , wish avail . This shall fully explain volunteer prior enrolment study . At completion study , subject shall treatment strong outcome score make available . Patient Recruitment All patient The Edinburgh foot ankle surgical unit , QMU musculoskeletal clinic , Dundee Podiatry Clinic The Queen Margaret Hospital , Dunfermline suspicion Morton 's neuroma shall invite participate study . A member patient 's exist clinical care team shall check whether meet study inclusion exclusion criterion make initial approach invite become involve study . They also give patient participant information literature . Their active involvement study amount initial six week follow review appointment six week , three , six , nine twelve month . Methods 1 . Prior study , pressure algometer , ultrasound machine high resolution walkway calibrate validated . 2 . Patients recruit variety source include Edinburgh Royal Infirmary , QMU , Margaret Rose Hospital , Dunfermline The Dundee Podiatry Clinic . 3 . The clinician source shall identify potential subject assess study 's inclusion exclusion criterion . Those express interest give write information form patient information sheet [ appendix 1 ] describes study detail . They invite contact chief investigator ( David Cashley ) choose become involved . 4 . Detailed information study give chief investigator potential subject make contact give appointment QMU gait analysis laboratory . There minimum three month wash-out period subject previously treatment Morton 's neuroma . 5 . Those attend QMU invite ask question study raise concern may . They ask still want participate study . If agree , ask sign consent form [ appendix 2 ] study participation number allocate point order aide anonymous data collection . The chief investigator gather information include age , gender , duration location symptom . 6 . Participants longer wish involve study direct Musculoskeletal clinic QMU assessment treatment . 7 . A baseline set VAS [ appendix 3 ] QoL [ appendix 4 ] score complete participant . All VAS QoL questionnaire complete solely subject , intervention third party . This serve blind researcher VAS questionnaire measurement study complete . 8 . The following clinical test shall perform participant predetermine order change participant order limit effect hyperalgesia ( repetitive testing ) adversely affect single test . The test follow ; Lateral squeeze test ; Digital nerve stretch test ; Gauthier 's test ; Sullivan 's sign ; Webspace tenderness test . Maximal ankle dorsiflexion plantar percussion ( MADAPP ) test . Details test find appendix 5 . 9 . All participant undergo dynamic ultrasound scan affected area . Where neuroma identify US , location size lesion record . In instance multiple neuromas , either bilaterally unilaterally , neuroma site participant 's great discomfort shall record . However , order limit impact additional neuroma pain score QoL score , neuromas treat . Where US scan negative neuroma participant shall remove study invite attend QMU MSK clinic treatment . If US scan identifies anomaly except neuroma , participant inform , withdrawn study refer appropriate treatment . 10 . Each participant shall measure HR Walkway order ass forefoot load pattern . The walkway mat set obtain plantar pressure distribution measurement set manner ensure none system cable interfere record participant . Connecting handle unit walkway sensor change status `` misalign '' `` sensor OK '' . The sensor handle unit hold place Velcro strip ensure placing secure . The participant ask walk along mat least twenty step order accomplish `` break '' , , computer give live pressure reading sensor . Data acquisition parameter include duration , frames record , frequency period . Once parameter set , data record commence . Participants ask walk full length mark walkway normal walk pace . This repeat record three time . 11 . At point participant shall complete second set VAS score QoL questionnaire . This do day first set US scan HR Walkway complete . This ensure VAS QoL measurement tool sufficiently robust , valid repeatable . Allowing time lapse therapeutic intervention result similar score obtain occasion , thereby infer tool measure accurately . 12 . All subject first pressure threshold meter ( PTM ) score record . This do taking measurement metatarsophalangeal joint ( MTPJ ) either side affect webspace use low score joint subsequent measurement . Where ambiguity regard webspace , less MTPJs measure low score joint use subsequent measurement . The PTM measurement take way readout display meter cover read . This double blind measurement neither subject practitioner sight PTM measurement result intervention complete . 13 . Minimisation weight randomisation use split subject two trial group . 14 . Those randomised steroid group shall receive single injection 1 mL methylprednisolone [ 40 mg ] 1 mL 2 % lignocaine . They shall ask return review six week . A second injection may offer point clinically indicate . 15 . Those manipulation group shall lesser MTPJs affected foot manually manipulate use high velocity , low amplitude thrust technique . They ask return week five week . At visit VAS PTM measurement shall repeat , manual manipulation . They shall also ask return review sixth week . 16 . All subject receive weekly text message ask rate pain scale 0 - 10 . 17 . At six week review ultrasound scan , high resolution walkway , clinical test , QoL questionnaires , VAS PTM score shall repeat . Subjects ask attend second review three month . 18 . The three month review shall follow format six week review subject ask attend six month one year review procedure shall follow . 19 . At end study , data shall process subject statistical analysis . Comparisons draw three group .</detailed_description>
