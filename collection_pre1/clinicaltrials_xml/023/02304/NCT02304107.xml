	<brief_title>Comparison Between Letrozole Urinary Purified FSH Women With Clomiphene Citrate Resistant Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) common endocrine disorder reproductive age , incidence 5 -10 % . Classically clomiphene citrate ( CC ) first approach induce ovulation patient PCOS . Although 70-80 % PCOS woman ovulate treatment CC , 40 % PCOS woman become pregnant . Women ovulate increase dos CC describe CC-resistant remain major challenge gynecologic endocrinology . Traditional alternative CC-resistant patient include gonadotropin therapy laparoscopic ovarian diathermy . Gonadotropin therapy widely use ovulation induction CC-resistant PCOS patient . The use purify FSH preparation virtually free LH activity , recommendable treatment since evidence pure FSH may significantly reduce tonic LH level , favourably alter intraovarian hormonal milieu , promote initial follicular development minimal risk multiple follicular growth ovarian hyperstimulation . The use metformin PCOS associate cycle regulation , improve ovulation , reduction circulate androgen level . Metformin likely play role improve ovulation induction woman PCOS variety action , include reduce insulin level alter effect insulin ovarian androgen biosynthesis , theca cell proliferation , endometrial growth . In addition , potentially direct effect , inhibit ovarian gluconeogenesis thus reduce ovarian androgen production . Letrozole orally-active aromatase inhibitor , good potential ovulation induction . Letrozole act reduce estrogen production block androgen estrogens conversion . Additionally , adverse effect endometrium cervical mucus ( 7 ) . This release pituitary negative feedback estrogens release FSH . Also , add positive effect increase follicular sensitivity FSH amplification FSH receptor gene expression . Hyper-insulinemia , closely associate PCOS , think one causative factor CC resistance . The prevalence insulin resistance PCOS close 50 % . All woman clomiphene resistant PCOS attend subfertility clinic Cairo university hospital invite participate study . PCOS diagnosis base chronic anovulation sonographic picture polycystic ovary ( 10 ) . Clomiphene resistance define failure ovulation spite receive 150mg clomiphene citrate 5 day menstrual cycle . Exclusion criterion age &gt; 40 year , cause infertility , hperprolactinaemia , allergy FSH metformin , previous FSH LOD therapy , body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 35 . The study explain participant write informed consent obtain participation . Full history take follow complete examination sonographic evaluation . Sonographic picture polycystic ovary define least 12 follicle 2-9mm ovary and/or ovarian volume &gt; 10cm3 ( 10 ) 210 woman clomiphene resistant PCOS randomly divide 3 equal group use computer generate random number . Group 1 receive FSH , group 2 Letrozole group 3 act control group intervention . Group 1 receive urinary purify FSH ( Fostimon速 IBSA , Switzerland ) 75IU daily 7 day start 3rd day menstruation progesterone withdrawal bleeding . If follicle exceed 9mm dose increase 37.5IU every 7 day . The cycle cancel follicle exceed 9mm 4 week start FSH . Group 2 receive Letrozole ( Femara速 , Novartis , Switzerland ) 2.5mg twice daily 5 day start 3rd day menstruation progesterone withdrawal bleeding . Group 3 regular progesterone withdrawal bleed form norethisterone ( stereonate速 Hi Pharm , Egypt ) . Serial vaginal ultrasound scan do start 10th day menstruation , frequency monitoring individualize accord woman 's response . When dominant follicle reach 17mm woman receive Human chorionic gonadotrophin ( Choriomon速 IBSA , Switzerland ) 5000IU timed intercourse advise 36 hour later .</detailed_description>
