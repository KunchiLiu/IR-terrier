	<brief_summary>Epilepsy common disease affect 0.5 1 % general population . Epilepsies refractory drug treatment lead increase morbidity , mortality high cost public health ( represent 75 % cost associate epilepsy among costly disease Neurology ) . The curative therapy surgical removal disconnection epileptogenic network . To , comprehensive presurgical evaluation essential accurately define location epileptogenic zone ( EZ ) relationship functional area must preserve . This approach require case intracerebral EEG recording . This latter technique , expensive invasive , remain present , standard method location ZE . In context , development non-invasive inexpensive method priority field . Moreover , many fundamental study show change ion homeostasis include sodium associate hyperexcitability relate epilepsy . The investigator team CEMEREM , CHU Timone , specialize development validation innovative method MRI , develop vivo sodium MRI acquisition process data unique France , capable quantify intracerebral sodium concentration three dimension completely non-invasive non-irradiating manner</brief_summary>
