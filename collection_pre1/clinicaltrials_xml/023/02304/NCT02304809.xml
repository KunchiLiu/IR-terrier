	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Assessing Secured Access Vemurafenib Patients With Tumors Harboring BRAF Genomic Alterations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This biology driven , trans-tumoral , multicentric phase II trial assess efficacy safety target agent vemurafenib monotherapy cohort patient identify activate molecular alteration BRAF gene . A cohort define pathology BRAF- alteration ( eg ovarian cancer BRAF V600 mutation ) . To explore efficacy vemurafenib per pathology per target . To assess safety profile vemurafenib . To explore whether molecularly drive , high quality multi-tumor screen phase II trial feasible French multiinstitutional , multidisciplinary setting . To investigate additional molecular mechanism patient tumor response versus patient without tumor response within cohort . The study include 11 cohort adult patient follow cancer alteration : - NSCLC V600 mutate - Ovarian cancer V600 mutate - Cholangiocarcinoma V600 mutate - Thyroid cancer V600 mutate - Prostatic cancer V600 mutate - Bladder cancer V600 mutate - Sarcoma/GIST V600 mutate - Multiple myeloma V600 mutate - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) V600 mutate - Hairy cell leukaemia ( HCL ) V600 mutate ( excludes Hairy Cell Leukemia variant type , marginal zone splenic lymphoma ( MZL ) , splenic red pulp lymphoma ( SRPL ) patient ) - Other pathology / alteration pre-defined . The cohort name `` Other '' include adult patient tumor harbor BRAF genomic alteration test via emerge biomarkers program molecular pangenomic program : - non-predefined pathology harbor V600 mutation - Same non-predefined pathology harbor non V600 activate mutation - Same non-predefined pathology harbor BRAF amplification .</detailed_description>
