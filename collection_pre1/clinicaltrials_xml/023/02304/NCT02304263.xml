	<brief_summary>Tenofovir continue play vital role treatment human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) age HIV-infected population increase United States worldwide , urgent need understand extent old age influence way antiretroviral medication work body . The investigator study aim characterize compare pharmacology tenofovir old versus young HIV-infected adult assess kidney function course approximately one year . The investigator analyze tenofovir level different compartment blood hair sample , assess relationship tenofovir concentration change kidney function time old young cohort . Lastly , investigator evaluate relationship tenofovir concentration functional status ( include body composition , bone mineral density , frailty ) study participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite grow population old HIV infect person world-wide , major knowledge gap exist regard pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics antiretroviral drug old person . In United States , median age HIV-infected person expect surpass 50 year 2015 . A global report UNAIDS indicate first time since start HIV epidemic , 10 % adult population currently live HIV low- middle-income country age 50 old , high-income country , approximately 30 % adult live HIV age 50 year . Hypertension , diabetes , cardiovascular disease , cancer , osteoporosis , cognitive decline , hepatic renal dysfunction commonly encounter problem old person . Frailty also commonly encounter age population define cumulative effect age-related decline multiple physiological system homeostatic mechanism , result great vulnerability stressor . People live HIV high prevalence earlier onset age-related decline health , include frailty , compare HIV-uninfected adult . The emphasis HIV management past decade shift prevention AIDS complication , management chronic non-infectious comorbidities increasingly older complicate patient population . Age-related decline health along establish change body composition individual get old ( increase body fat , decrease lean mass ) , may impact pharmacokinetics antiretroviral medication use treatment HIV , study adequately . To date , substantial lack information regard pharmacokinetics antiretroviral medication , include tenofovir ( TFV ) , old HIV-infected adult . As evidence , 'Geriatric Use ' section Viread® ( tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , TDF ) -containing product state following , `` Clinical study Viread® include sufficient number subject age 65 determine whether respond differently young subject . In general , dose selection elderly patient cautious , keep mind great frequency decrease hepatic , renal , cardiac function , concomitant disease drug therapy . '' These gap knowledge arise underrepresentation old individual early phase drug development . This especially true antiretroviral drug HIV-infection afflict mostly young people time antiretroviral drug develop . It important realize HIV-infected individual reach old age high number , study urgently need optimize drug response population . A major gap knowledge lack information surround association functional ( frailty ) status pharmacology antiretroviral medication old HIV-infected individual . As old adult experience natural decline renal function , drug renally eliminate may accumulate systemic circulation , thus increase risk toxicity . Tenofovir renally eliminate principal dose-related toxicity new worsen renal impairment , mean slow elimination may accelerate damage kidney population . In order ass change renal function clinically , regression equation incorporate age , Cockgroft-Gault MDRD , utilized , depend serum creatinine ( endogenous muscle byproduct ) . Serum creatinine ideal marker old population muscle mass decrease age . A good method quantify actual GFR evaluate plasma clearance contrast agent , iohexol ( iGFR ) . This approach consider gold standard assess renal function age . The Anderson Laboratory recently validate method measure intracellular concentration tenofovir-di-phosphate ( TFV-DP ) , active form tenofovir , red blood cell ( RBC ) use dry blood spot ( DBS ) indicate recent cumulative dosing . Similar benefit provide hemoglobin A1C test diabetes therapy , TFV-DP DBS test allows much need quantitative approach assess cumulative exposure tenofovir long periods time . This enable 17 day half-life TFV-DP RBC . Measuring TFV concentration scalp hair alternative method measure cumulative exposure drug long period time ( week month ) , demonstrate researcher University California San Francisco . These novel biomarkers long-term tenofovir exposure provide opportunity compare cumulative tenofovir exposure old versus young individual . Long-term use tenofovir associate two main adverse effect , namely change bone mineral density renal function , however link age , tenofovir exposure , rate decline bone mineral density renal function fully elucidate . The goal present study characterize compare pharmacokinetics TFV old HIV-infected adult versus young HIV-infected adult assess change bone mineral density renal function ( use iohexol ) approximate one year time period two cohort . The study also include measure body composition ( use duel-energy x-ray absorptiometry , DXA ) functional status ( frailty ) ass relationship factor TFV pharmacology young old HIV-infected cohort .</detailed_description>
