	<brief_summary>This study evaluate two main type replacement tissue heart valve use current practice , compare outcomes surgical aortic valve replacement ( AVR ) recently introduce `` key-hole '' procedure call transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) . Participants recruit various time point range 1 month 10 year follow valve replacement either AVR TAVI . It think progressive calcium ( chalk ) formation responsible failure majority valve . All participant therefore PET-CT scan special type `` tracer '' call 18F-fluoride order measure active calcium formation valve . They annual clinical follow-up 5 year invite back repeat CT scan 2 year measure change calcium burden . This study aim investigate , firstly , effect valve age type calcium formation measure PET-CT , secondly , whether measure calcium formation help predict long different type valve last . If successful , 18F-fluoride PET-CT could become valuable tool test new treatment improve valve longevity new valve design .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18F-Fluoride Assessment Aortic Bioprosthesis Durability Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aortic stenosis common form valve disease western world lead indication valve surgery . Bioprosthetic valve know degenerate via process predominantly drive calcification . Transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) recently emerge less invasive alternative conventional aortic valve replacement ( AVR ) surgery . Whilst technique hold great promise , long-term follow data lack longevity valve remain establish . In longitudinal , cross-sectional study 180 subject either surgical transcatheter implant bioprostheses , study proposes look early sign active calcification use 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography ( PET ) . During 5 year follow-up period , study hope demonstrate 18F-fluoride PET predict subsequent bioprosthetic valve degeneration identify patient risk premature valve failure . The study also hop inform comparative durability novel percutaneous valve . If successful , 18F-Fluoride could provide useful method assess novel therapeutic strategy target improve longevity bioprostheses help guide future valve design .</detailed_description>
