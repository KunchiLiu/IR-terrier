	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess efficacy d-cycloserine ( DCS ) augmentation strategy two psychotic patient triplication ( 4 copy ) glycine decarboxylase ( GLDC ) gene . Subjects first undergo eight-week open-label arm treatment DCS ( 50 mg/d ) follow six 6-week double-blind placebo-controlled exposure DCS placebo . The length double-blind arm limit six week minimize length symptom exacerbation experience subject receive placebo . The randomization scheme allow two consecutive exposure DCS , allow two consecutive exposure placebo , minimize length symptom exacerbation . At end open-label DCS trial , follow procedure carry : structural MRI ( 3T ) , proton 1H MRS ( 4T ) , fMRI ( 3T ) , steady-state auditory evoke potential , electroretinogram recording . In addition , 1H MRS ( 4T ) 2 hour single oral dose DCS assess . Baseline data measure previously obtain part different study register clinical trials.gov - NCT01720316 ) . Positive , negative , affective symptom neurocognitive function well plasma level large neutral large small neutral excitatory amino acid psychotropic drug level assess periodically . Pharmaceutical grade DCS ) placebo compound dispensed McLean Hospital Pharmacy . The investigator hypothesize mutation carrier reduce endogenous brain glycine GABA level increase brain glutamate glutamine level . DCS administration increase brain glycine two carrier compare baseline treatment glycine ( 0.8g/kg ) . The investigator hypothesize reduce activation magnocellular pathway abnormal ERPs modulate NMDA mutation carrier compare non-carrier family member control . . The investigator hypothesize DCS , placebo , improve positive , negative affective symptom well neurocognitive function . The investigator also hypothesize DCS improve clinical cognitive functioning , partially normalize decreased baseline glycine GABA increase glutamate glutamine , partially normalize magnocellular pathway activation abnormal evoked potential .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple rare structural variant relatively recent evolutionary origin recognize important risk factor schizophrenia ( SZ ) neurodevelopmental disorder ( e.g. , autism spectrum disorder , mental retardation , epilepsy ) odds ratios high 7-30 . We find de novo structural rearrangement chromosome 9p24.1 two psychotic patient . One gene region gene encode glycine decarboxylase ( GLDC ) , affect brain glycine metabolism . GLDC encode glycine decarboxylase glycine cleavage system P-protein , involve degradation glycine glia cell . Carriers GLDC triplication would expect low level brain Gly , result NMDA receptor-mediated hypofunction , strongly implicate pathophysiology schizophrenia . There extensive literature effect NMDA enhance agent positive , negative , depressive symptom neurocognitive function . Although many study report positive result least one symptom domain , result study negative ambiguous . Factors likely contribute variability include : mechanism action agent , compliance , concurrent treatment first- vs second generation antipsychotic drug , baseline glycine blood level , presence/absence kynurenine pathway metabolic abnormality individual difference brain glycine uptake metabolism . Genetic variant impact synthesis breakdown glycine , glutamate , modulators NMDA receptor function also likely significant effect . Although DCS augmentation show variable efficacy patient unselected mutation would expect low brain glycine level , GLDC triplication two carrier study would expect result unusually low brain glycine level , support therapeutic potential augmentation strategy . Thus , important evaluate therapeutic efficacy DCS augmentation individual high prior probability therapeutic benefit characterize neurobiology mutation term brain metabolite , brain function , pharmacokinetics glycine metabolism use well-established method .</detailed_description>
