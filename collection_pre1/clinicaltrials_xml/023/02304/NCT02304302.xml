	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn medication Memantine Hydrochloride ( study medication ) help adolescent young adult Down syndrome . Dr. Alberto Costa research team want see 16-week treatment medication improve participant 's ability learn remember thing . In study , memantine hydrochloride use . Thus , researcher want learn whether study drug help improve memory young adult Down syndrome . To test effect study medicine , half people study receive study medicine half receive placebo ( inactive substance ) . Memantine approve medication treat memory think problem person Alzheimer disease . However , little known effect medication person Down syndrome approve use person Down syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Down Syndrome Memantine Follow-up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study seek investigate medication Memantine Hydrochloride help young adult Down syndrome . Two hundred person Down syndrome gender 15 32 year age recruit two site : Cleveland , OH , USA SÃ£o Paulo , SP , Brazil . Participants assign randomly either placebo group group take active medication 50 % probability either group . Neither participant investigator know take study medication take placebo study . Only investigational pharmacist access information . Up 60 people Down syndrome recruit study participant take part optional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study . This investigation aim help make EEG study precise find whether study medication significant effect structure brain . Additionally , recruit control group 60 age- gender-matched participant without Down syndrome . The goal investigate different group people activate brain hear see something , use high-density EEG MRI see study medication work person Down syndrome . In word , additional control group help u ascertain part test result due person Down syndrome one . Persons without Down syndrome come one EEG visit one MRI visit , ask take study medication . The visit participant Down syndrome follow : Screening visit ( approximately 2-hour long ) . The subject ask his/her health , medical history , social background , work background , well simple question determine performance test memory function part study . Informed consent assent obtain visit . At end visit , EEG machine use access brain response different auditory visual stimulus . Some ask would willing MRI perform , portion imperative . A urine sample collect used obtain cell keep frozen potential future study . If date screen visit convenient , sample collect next five visit . Visit 1 ( approximately 1 hour ) . Pulse , blood pressure , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) take . At end visit , urine blood sample take . Pregnancy also check . Visit 2 ( 2-3 hour ) . Tests memory , learning , reason skill conduct start study medicine placebo . At end visit , 60-day supply either study medicine placebo give . This need take 16 week . Visit 3 ( approximately 30 minute ) . Eight week begin treatment , participant return ass she/he treatment . Pulse , blood pressure , physical exam , pregnancy check . At visit , another supply study medicine give . Visit 4 ( 2-3 hour ) . Sixteen week start medicine , participant take second series test learn , memory , reason skill find whether change skill . Visit 5 ( approximately 1 hour ) . In 16th 17th week start medicine , participant meet one time doctor visit 1 3 . Vital sign , physical exam , ECG take , well blood sample ensure nothing change participant 's general health . For woman , pregnancy test perform . If reason subject withdraws study prior Visit 5 , he/she ask return clinic `` Treatment Discontinuation Visit . '' In addition , participant discontinues medication prior end study , he/she ask complete `` Retrieved Dropout Visit '' date represent Visit 5 . Study medication provide beyond study period .</detailed_description>
