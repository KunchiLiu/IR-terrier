	<detailed_description>The drug use intensive care unit numerous administration base strong expertise context urgency complexity . Nurses role carry preparation treatment implement complex treatment require risk management approach surpass simple task decree professional act refers . In context , administration catecholamine , widely use intensive care medicine treatment shock , appear sensitive issue study . These vasoactive drug short half-life narrow therapeutic index . Administration careful ensure efficiency prevention complication hemodynamic instability arrhythmia . Administration therapeutic must strictly continuous , say deliver use electric syringe pump . Syringe replacement appear critical moment risk flow change brief interruption infusion . There three main type syrinx relay technique , date , study compare technique . There thus recommendation base objective data guide clinical nursing practice . This study aim provide evidence order secure administration catecholamine . It may also use reference evaluation new feature allow automation relay call `` smart pump '' study demonstrate added value term security . No progress possible secure administration drug short half-life , narrow therapeutic index significant side effect without deep reflection condition infusion . The choice material use development care procedure must base reliable timely recommendation . Patients expect safe care . Nurses must able reference enable guide practice benefit patient .</detailed_description>
