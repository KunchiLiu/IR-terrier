	<detailed_description>Normal body iron store value overweight subject currently describe literature . The comparison value body iron level patient suffer dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome ( DIOS ) could allow quantify iron overload condition . DIOS lead cause hyperferritinemia mainly affect men 45 60 year . It characterize unexplained hyperferritinemia associate metabolic disorder ( include overweight ) iron overload , objectify MRI liver biopsy . Some author suggest hyperferritinemia associate metabolic disorder expression inflammatory syndrome cause insulin resistance steatohepatitis , manifestation real iron overload . The debate surround iron overload DIOS relate limit current analysis method ( phlebotomy , liver iron concentration , MRI ) . At present , phlebotomy standard method use determine body iron store . Using method , purpose study determine iron level healthy overweight volunteer , compare DIOS patient treat phlebotomy include another ongoing clinical trial ( SAIGNEES - ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01045525 ) .</detailed_description>
