	<brief_summary>This randomize , open label , single center safety efficacy study . At least 40 cirrhotic subject HCV genotype 3 receive standard care treatment sofosbuvir ribavirin ( SOF/RBV ) well 60 mg daily Daclatasvir ( investigational product ) . Subjects randomized 1:1 receive either : - Group A : 16 week DCV/SOF/RBV - Group B : 24 week DCV/SOF/RBV Subjects return study center various time point throughout 16 24 week treatment addition 12 week post take last dose study drug monitor safety efficacy . These visit accord standard care .</brief_summary>
