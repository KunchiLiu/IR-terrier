	<brief_title>Dose-Escalation Study Evaluating Safety Pharmacokinetics Artesunate Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Artemisinins , compound extract herb Artemisia annua , safe effective FDA-approved antimalarial drug . Recent study suggest artemisinins also exert anti-angiogenic cytotoxic effect human cancer cell . Artesunate ( ART ) water soluble semisynthetic artemisinin improve pharmacokinetic property . A single-center phase I dose-escalation study evaluate safety pharmacokinetics oral Artesunate patient Advanced HCC . Approximately 15 patient enrolled trial . Dose-escalation protocol : The first patient receive 200 mg Artesunate once-daily 14 day . If dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) observe 14 day , next patient start daily dose 300 mg Artesunate . If DLT observe 14 day , cohort 3 patient receive 400 mg once-daily 14 day . For subsequent cohort 3 patient 200 mg add dose , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine .</detailed_description>
