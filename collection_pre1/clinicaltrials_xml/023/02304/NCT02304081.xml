In context , fine-tuning alpha- beta cell activity fundamental avoid excessive metabolic excursion . The pathogenesis type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) drive insulin resistance , follow increase imbalance alpha beta cell activity characterise relative insulin deficiency increase glucagon secretion especially postprandial state . Individual arrangement complementary antidiabetic drug escalation pharmacological intervention T2DM major challenge . There substantial need provide scientific rationale best effective combination antidiabetic drug regard potency address different aspect pathophysiology T2DM . Therefore , study evaluate potential synergistic and/or complementary effect pharmacological intervention T2DM deem imperative . This study aim evaluate effect DPP-IV inhibitor saxagliptin ( compare placebo ) addition SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin insulin resistance , pancreatic alpha beta cell function . Triple therapy metformin , SGLT-2 inhibitor , DPP-IV inhibitor show efficacious safe several study approve treatment T2DM European Medical Agency . Therefore , subject T2DM stable metformin background therapy enrol trial . This single center , phase IV , prospective , placebo-controlled , exploratory , proof-of-mechanism study . This two-step treatment trial first open label second randomise , double-blinded , placebo control treatment phase . In treatment phase 1 ( TP1 , 30±4 day ) , 26 subject receive dapagliflozin 10 mg daily add pre-existing metformin monotherapy . Thereafter , treatment phase 2 ( TP2 , 30±4 day ) , subject randomise additional saxagliptin 5 mg correspond placebo treatment 1:1 ratio . Trial subject subsequently undergo treatment phase , endpoint assessment perform begin end treatment phase Visits 2 , 3 , 4Assignment treatment allocation take place investigational site . The total study duration subject 64 84 day . The use combine euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic hyperglycaemic glucose clamp protocol choose order ass parameter insulin resistance well alpha- beta-cell function highly standardised condition within small study population . Trained member staff perform administration IMP clinical site . Drug accountability perform Visit 2 Visit 4 base subject diary return study medication . Whenever deviation note Investigator , Sponsor and/or monitor informed implication deviation must review discuss . The deviation must document , explain reason deviation ( root cause analysis ) , action take impact deviation subject ( ) and/or trial . The safety laboratory perform first check value safety parameter flag value outside reference range . The Investigator must evaluate result outside reference range . Before Investigator start trial , laboratory reference range must available Investigator 's Trial File . The result provide safety laboratory part trial database . Data Management responsibility Profil Institut für Stoffwechselforschung GmbH , Neuss Germany . The objective monitoring procedure ensure ( ) safety right trial subject respect , ( ii ) accurate , valid complete data collect , ( iii ) trial conduct accordance trial protocol , principle GCP local legislation . The monitor must give direct access Trial Investigator File source document ( original document , data record ) . Direct access include permission examine , analyse , verify reproduce record ( ) report ( ) important evaluation clinical trial . Key task monitor include verify presence inform consent , adherence inclusion/exclusion criterion , documentation SAEs , record safety efficacy variable . The monitor also confirm completeness patient record , adherence protocol progress subject enrolment . Profil Institut für Stoffwechselforschung GmbH , Neuss , Germany , responsible statistical analysis . The statistical planning conduct analyse data study follow principle define relevant ICH guideline Sponsor 's biostatistical standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) . All statistical analysis perform use SAS® ( SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , North Carolina , United States America [ USA ] ) , version 9.3 later . For lack exist data confirmatory sample size calculation , study design exploratory proof-of-mechanism study experimental assessment set-up . All obtain result handle equal emphasis strictly exploratory sense . The data obtain trial serve purpose thesis generation design potential confirmatory study . Dapagliflozin well Saxagliptin approve treatment T2DM adult male female patient . Because moreover expect effect either drug endpoint measure differ male female subject T2DM , specific gender distribution plan study . Based previous study twelve patient T2DM treatment dapagliflozin , group size 12 patient group power 80 % detect difference significance level 0,05 ( two-tailed ) . Before data release statistical analysis , blind review data take place identify protocol deviation may potentially affect result . This review perform without reveal trial product subject assign . The blind trial product maintain everyone involve allocating subject analysis set data release statistical analysis . Furthermore , outlier identify data review accord ICH-E9 , use fake randomisation . In addition , protocol deviation , may potentially affect result , identify evaluated subject and/or data exclude analysis . The subject observation exclude analysis set , reason , describe clinical trial report . All available data include data listing tabulation . In general imputation value miss data perform . In general , metric variable derive parameter present use descriptive summary statistic include arithmetic mean , median , minimum , maximum standard deviation . Categorical variable present use descriptive summary statistic include number patient percentage . Percentages patient base non-missing value . In addition , efficacy variable well derive parameter geometric mean coefficient variation present well . Descriptive summary also present . Unless otherwise state , formal test conduct two-sided 5 % level significance . No alpha adjustment do . All analysis primary secondary efficacy endpoint interpret exploratory manner . To investigate dapagliflozin-corrected treatment effect , evaluation change Visit 3 Visit 4 incremental AUCGluc270-390min / AUCIns270-390min perform use analysis covariance ( ANOVA ) change incremental AUCGluc270-390min / AUCIns270-390min response , treatment fixed effect baseline ( Visit 2 ) value covariate . From model , least square mean change Visit 3 Visit 4 95 % confidence interval change calculate . In addition , estimate placebo-corrected treatment effect ( difference least square mean Visit 3 Visit 4 change saxagliptin placebo ) correspond 95 % confidence interval calculate . If data homogeneous normally distribute successfully transform , analysis perform non-parametric technique use Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test within treatment comparison Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test treatment comparison base two-sided alpha level 0.05 . In addition , estimate Hodges Lehmann correspond 95 % non-parametric confidence interval show . The secondary efficacy endpoint derive hyperglycaemic clamp phase base incremental AUCs calculate described primary endpoint . All AEs enter CRF ( AEs since first dose ) cod . All AEs present individual listing frequency table break body system preferred term assign Medical Dictionary Regulatory Activity , appropriate .
