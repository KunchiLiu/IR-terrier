	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease major cause morbidity death patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Patients CKD ESRD high risk myocardial dysfunction , ischemia heart failure . The mechanisms linking impaired renal function increase risk cardiovascular disease , however , remain elusive . In addition , conventional therapeutic proven effective reduce cardiovascular event general population fail provide similar benefit uremic patient . There clear need identify novel mediator cardiovascular complication uremic patient provide insight pathogenesis , tailor clinical care base cardiovascular risk , develop new therapeutic strategy . It become increasingly clear transcription eukaryotic genome far pervasive complex previously appreciate . While expression messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) microRNAs ( miRNAs ) account ~1 % transcribed specie , 90 % mammalian genome transcribe long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) , heterogeneous group non-coding transcript longer 200 nucleotide . LncRNAs show functional involve specific physiological pathological process epigenetic , transcriptional post-transcriptional mechanism . While role lncRNAs human disease include cancer neurodegenerative disorder begin emerge , remain unclear lncRNA regulation contribute cardiovascular complication patient renal dysfunction . In proposal , seek apply next-generation sequence technology investigate circulating ( plasma peripheral blood mononuclear cell [ PBMC ] ) lncRNA expression control subject patient CKD ESRD . We test hypothesis circulate lncRNA expression signature reflect underlie kidney disease state patient CKD ESRD . A gene co-expression network analysis conduct identify lncRNAs functionally involved pathogenesis CKD ESRD . Next , identify circulate lncRNAs indicative cardiovascular dysfunction ESRD patient . The hypothesis circulate lncRNAs use predict progression myocardial dysfunction , occurrence adverse cardiovascular event death among patient ESRD , test . The sensitivity specificity use circulate lncRNAs predict cardiovascular function/outcomes ESRD patient test prospectively independent ESRD population . Finally , propose test hypothesis circulate lncRNAs novel prognostic biomarkers predict cardiovascular outcome renal function progression CKD patient . The result experiment lead good understand circulate lncRNAs contribute uremic cardiovascular complication renal function progression . These experiment also help design well diagnostic prognostic tool CKD/ESRD patient , well develop novel therapeutic strategy treat prevent CKD progression uremic cardiovascular complication .</detailed_description>
