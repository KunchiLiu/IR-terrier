	<brief_summary>All patient ( ≥18 year ) spontaneous SAH proven compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) lumbar puncture consider trial . Upon presentation neurosurgical centre patient treat accord local protocol . Upon admission patient clinically evaluate occurrence clinical sign brain herniation syndrome ( anisocoria , bilateral dilate pupil , posture ) . Usually first line treatment include neurological resuscitation ( placement external cerebrospinal fluid drainage case hydrocephalus , treatment seizure , general intensive care measure ) . Hereafter , patient clinically evaluate second time . The patient grade accord usual WFNS scale modify `` herniation WFNS '' scale . The whole treatment patient accord local clinical protocol . Outcome measure six twelve month train investigator unaware clinical data . The primary endpoint difference specificity WFNS hWFNS respect poor outcome ( mRS 4-6 ) 6 month initial haemorrhage . Given specificity sensitivity negatively correlate , difference sensitivity second primary outcome . The null hypothesis test ratio true negative rate ( specificity ) hWFNS WFNS score 1.35 i.e . new score detect 35 % patient truly negative ( good outcome ) compare old score . In addition negative correlation specificity sensitivity also test ratio true positive rate ( sensitivity ) 0.82 i.e . new score 18 % less patient truly positive ( poor outcome ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Herniation WFNS Grading Spontaneous Subarachnoid Hemorrhage - SWISS SOS Observational Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) severe disease affect approximately 400 patient per year Switzerland . Death severe disability spontaneous SAH relate initial severity bleeding . The scale often use recommend grade severity SAH World Federation Neurosurgical Societies scale . Besides Glasgow Coma Scale basis WFNS grading , existence neurologic deficit include scale . In general WFNS I-III patient term good grade WFNS IV V poor grade . Morbidity Mortality SAH increase high WFNS grade . Yet , despite low Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) score poor grade SAH , 35 50 % aggressively treat patient show favorable outcome.Even severe SAH , i.e . WFNS grade V , good outcome observe 24 50 % patient treat aggressively , limit usefulness scale decision whether withhold continue treatment . Especially differentiation WFNS grade IV WFNS grade V intubate patient huge problem . The reason discrepancy poor grade favorable outcome due difficulty reliable GCS assessment acute stage SAH . In acute stage clinical status patient distort due sedative medication , seizure hydrocephalus necessarily display `` real '' clinical status . Therefore favorable outcome poor grade SAH patient matter beneficial course , rather initial wrong WFNS grading . The necessity reliable WFNS grading become evident clinical decision make basis scientific data different study compare . With respect clinical decision - usually WFNS grade V patient treat due limited capacity survive SAH . Up validate triage scheme identify SAH patient likely benefit aggressive treatment base WFNS score . Because GCS basis WFNS grading , information progressive herniation beyond motor response posture — e.g . third nerve dysfunction loss brain stem reflex — unfortunately incorporate routine SAH grading . As known consequence , sedate ventilated patient exhibit motor response symmetrically reactive pupil intact brain stem reflex may wrongly classify GCS score 3 thus WFNS grade V , lead inaccuracy prognostic power WFNS poor grade patient . In study , investigator apply concept follow logic original GCS design pathophysiological concept behind scale . During progression brain herniation , abnormal flexion ( decorticate rigidity , late diencephalic syndrome ) follow abnormal extensor posturing ( decerebrate rigidity , mesencephalic syndrome ) . Both positive sign , i.e . sign observe examiner . If herniation progress , damage occur medulla typical sign flaccidity , response pain , mydriasis reaction light . Using latter `` positive '' sign would help verify true GCS 3 patient . The purpose study re-evaluate prognostic power WFNS classification , particularly regard poor grade patient . The investigator compare exist WFNS grade modify WFNS herniation grade model ( hWFNS ) respect predict poor outcome death . Objective The primary objective observational study test whether sign herniation ( dilated unilateral bilateral pupil , posture ) improve predictive value poor outcome 6 month SAH . Specifically , study aim show improve ( superiority ) specificity modify scale maintaining ( non-inferiority ) sensitivity . Secondary objective impact radiological factor ( general/focal brain edema , intracerebral hematoma , hydrocephalus , amount subarachnoid blood ) well clinical factor ( seizure , time grading , sedation ) impact herniation grade patient SAH . Methods Patients proven spontaneous SAH enter study . Upon presentation neurosurgical centre patient treat accord local protocol . The patient clinically assess neurosurgical resuscitation . Patients screen occurrence clinical sign brain herniation syndrome . The patient grade accord usual WFNS scale modify `` herniation WFNS '' scale . Outcome measure six twelve month train investigator unaware clinical data .</detailed_description>
