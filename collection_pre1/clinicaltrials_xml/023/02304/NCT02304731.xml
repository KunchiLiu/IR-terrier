	<detailed_description>Modern society increasingly seek healthy life style , regular physical activity consider one main factor improve quality life . The evidence show aerobic physical training control environment benefit various aspect human health , include cognition elderly population . However , exercise perform polluted environment , individual subject grater exposure pollutant due increase ventilation ( breathe ) . It well know inhaled pollutant cause oxidative modification biomolecules oxidative stress cause diverse disease . This scenario raise important question : deleterious effect pollution abolish beneficial effect exercise ? This issue currently relevant give increase level air pollution large urban center Sao Paulo city time , outdoor physical activity public place largely stimulate public organization , particularly elderly . Thus multidisciplinary project aim investigate deleterious effect urban air pollution elderly people practice aerobic physical exercise outdoors Sao Paulo compare practice Laboratory . This study provide important knowledge public health welfare population .</detailed_description>
