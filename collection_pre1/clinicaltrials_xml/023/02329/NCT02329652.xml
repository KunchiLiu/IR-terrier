	<brief_title>Multi-functional Neuroprosthetic System Restoration Motor Function Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal project restore multiple function individual comprehensive neuroprosthetic approach address overall need individual . This approach involve aspect implementation , include implanted technology , surgical installation , outcomes assessment coordinate team approach order maximize functional independence gain individual . With system , propose individual mid-cervical-level spinal cord injury regain control multiple function , include grasp , reach , bed mobility , seat posture , restoration effective cough bladder function . This ambitious excite goal make possible culmination research clinical deployment neuroprosthetic system spinal cord injure subject past 30 year . We anticipate system provide increase independence target body function , provide enough overall benefit demonstrate significant improvement quality life health outcome . In clinical feasibility study spinal cord injure subject , clinical research team demonstrate control bilateral hand function , bed mobility , postural control , restoration effective cough , bladder control use chronically implant neuroprostheses . Outcomes clinical study demonstrate system provide increased functional independence individual . Initially , single type implant system implement one individual , result restoration single bodily function . Thus , necessary subject choose available function select one , despite fact subject multiple disability . In past year , progress implement subject one system , provide hand function trunk stability . However , fundamental limitation current approach technological ; i.e . implanted system completely independent ( technically programmatically ) , require separate technology develop function , system implement separate team separate surgical procedure . Thus , point , possible address individual 's comprehensive need tailor overall approach maximize functional gain . The propose approach depend availability foundational platform technology capable meeting broad specification . We achieve milestone separate funding , create revolutionary new implantable neuroprosthetic technology fully capable provide necessary technological base propose research . This system , Networked Neuroprosthetic System ( NNPS ) , modular , scalable , configurable network fully implant , networked module capable meeting exceed need neuroprosthetic application . The NNPS provide foundation enables efficient technical refinement optimize implementation system target application . The NNPS technology currently operational undergo fabrication test preparation final pre-clinical study human implantation .</detailed_description>
