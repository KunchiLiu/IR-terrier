	<brief_summary>There specific treatment Ebola Virus Disease ( EVD ) . Current EVD care supportive , include intravenous oral rehydration , nutrition , pain killer , treatment coinfections antibacterial antimalarial drug , blood transfusion appropriate . Despite intervention , mortality remain high since ongoing Ebola outbreak West Africa declare April . Potential anti-Ebola specific intervention include convalescent plasma , monoclonal polyclonal antibody , small inhibitory RNA ( siRNA ) , synthetic adenosine analogue RNA polymerase inhibitor . All intervention consider investigational due lack data human EVD . In study , investigator choose study efficacy favipiravir drug : - show anti-Ebola efficacy immunodeficient murine model ; - study thousand adult human participate anti-influenza trial , good tolerance ; approve treat novel resistant influenza infection Japan ; - immediately available ; - use orally , easily give adult child pill crush mixed food liquid ; - recently use Europe treat several patient EVD ; French drug safety agency ( ANSM ) review publish data well data provide firm ( Toyama Chemical Co. , Ltd ) , approve compassionate use EVD . Here investigator propose assess efficacy high-dosed favipiravir reduce mortality human EVD . In present trial `` JIKI '' ( mean `` Hope '' `` Kissi '' language ) , investigator , sponsor , scientific advisory board safety monitor board coordinate reactive way , new fact discuss rapidly research plan adapt accordingly ( change drug dosage ; use drug combination ; combination another strategy passive immunization convalescent plasma , etc . ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Favipiravir Against Ebola ( JIKI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses : 1 . The efficacy antivirals patient EVD correlate negatively time since first symptom . Thus , proof concept trial , main analysis do adult patient early symptom efficacy expect high ; 2 . Favipiravir EVD give high dose previously test study human influenza . For trial , dose calculate base pharmacokinetics simulation , rapidly reach plasma concentration associate anti-EBOV activity . 3 . A third assumption make , give recent pre-trial data show first strong link baseline viral load mortality second high mortality child 6 year : efficacy antiviral patient EVD correlate negatively viral load start treatment young age . Thus secondary objective efficacy favipiravir adult patient child &gt; 6 year moderate baseline viral load ( i.e . cycle threshold [ Ct ] ≥20 measure RT-PCR ) efficacy expect high . A comparative trial favipiravir standard package care ( without placebo ) deem appropriate : ) highly sensitive social political context ; ii ) need collect rapidly basic phase II evidence efficacy high dose favipiravir EVD choose best intervention ( ) test phase III ( favipiravir alone combination drug ; therapeutic option include convalescent plasma ) . Therefore , investigator propose non-comparative , proof-of-concept , phase II trial patient EVD , allow conclude within week : - mortality patient start favipiravir within 72 hour onset first symptoms inferior mortality without treatment prior trial initiation ; - trend favipiravir brings significant benefit term survival . Objectives Primary objective : assess efficacy high-dosed favipiravir reduce mortality human EVD . Secondary objective : ass evolution EBOV plasma RNA infectious load treatment ; tolerance favipiravir ; viral micro-diversity EBOV , trough concentration favipiravir factor associate mortality toxicity . Groups In protocol , investigator refer follow group accord age duration symptoms* : Group A1 : adult time first symptom first dose favipiravir ≤72h ; Group A2 : adult time first symptom first dose favipiravir &gt; 72h Group C : child &gt; 1 year weight ≥10kg . Time first symptom refers time begin symptom consider related EVD . * Symptoms consider : acute onset fever , severe headache , myalgia , extreme fatigue , vomit , diarrhoea , abdominal pain , unexplained hemorrhage . Given recent pre-trial data , second definition group also use : group AC1 : adult child &gt; 6 year baseline Ct ≥20 ; group AC2 : adult child &gt; 6 year baseline Ct value &lt; 20 ; group YC : young child ≤6 year &gt; 1 year . Sample size : recruitment trial keep opened group group A1 reach 60 participant , unless early termination recommend DSMB . Because expect efficacy treatment maximum patient early symptom , sample size calculation base analysis mortality group A1 . The observed pre-trial mortality estimate use three month data ( 15/08/2014 15/11/2014 ) MSF database Gueckedou EVD centre . Given estimation , remain pragmatic conservative , set pre-trial mortality 55 % group A1 , A2 , C. With 60 participant group A1 , power conclude mortality trial -20 % inferior pre-trial mortality equal 89 % . Statistical analysis primary outcome : mortality Day-14 95 % CI report overall group separately . Day-0 day first dose favipiravir . In group A1 , number death &lt; 24 ( 40 % ) 60 participant , upper bound 95 % CI &lt; 55 % . In group A2 , number death &lt; 54 ( 45 % ) 120 participant , upper bound 95 % CI &lt; 55 % . In group C , number death &lt; 17 ( 38 % ) 45 participant , upper bound 95 % CI &lt; 55 % In group ( A1 , A2 , C ) , investigator conclude favipiravir decrease mortality upper bound 95 % CI include observed pre-trial mortality ( 55 % ) untreated patient duration symptom prior trial initiation . Statistical analysis secondary outcome : mortality Day-14 exact 95 % CI report accord second group definition ( AC1 , AC2 , YC ) . In group , conclude favipiravir decrease mortality upper bound 95 % CI include observed pre-trial mortality ( 30 % , 85 % 70 % , respectively ) untreated patient characteristic prior trial initiation . All following outcome analyse overall separately two group definition ( A1 , A2 , C AC1 , AC2 , YC ) : evolution EBOV plasma RNA infectious load Day-0 end follow describe patient . The number , proportion exact 95 % CI describe grade 3-4 adverse event ; resistance mutation ; patient reach criteria cure Day-30 . The distribution ( median , IQR , min-max ) initial maximal viral load , time maximal viral load undetectability , rate increase/decrease report . The distribution trough concentration favipiravir point inter- intra-patient variability concentration describe . Factors associated mortality Day-14 , cure Day-30 grade 3-4 clinical biological adverse event ( include time first symptoms treatment initiation , evolution EBOV viral load , trough concentration favipiravir ) study . Stopping rule futility : intermediate analysis mortality futility , perform every 20 adult group every 10 child : - Adults : recruitment two group A1 A2 prematurely stop result show trial unlikely prove mortality favipiravir &lt; 55 % ; - Children : recruitment group C prematurely stop result show trial unlikely prove mortality favipiravir &lt; 55 % . Toxicity : death report sponsor DSMB daily basis ; SAE death report sponsor DSMB weekly basis . Sponsor coordination The trial sponsor INSERM . The international coordinating , monitor data management centre `` Mereva '' clinical trial unit ( CTU ) , international team member affiliate Inserm 897 Unit , University Bordeaux `` Pacci/ANRS '' research site Abidjan . Trial coordinating , monitor data management activity coordinate International Clinical Project Manager ( CPM ) . In Guinea , trial conduct , trial country coordination center ( CCC ) put place , lead country CPM work close collaboration international CPM participate clinical centre . The trial conduct monitor accord Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ) manual . Monitoring In order ensure clinical trial conduct properly , CTU CCC coordinate study activity Project Team . This include particular : - Set monitor workflow , timeline , milestone track tool ; - Conduct regular team meeting discuss project status , activity , address issue ; - Maintain daily contact principal investigator , sponsor clinical site ; - Provide status report principal investigator , DSMB , SAB ; - Support study site study related question ; - Ensure study drug store , dispense , account accord specification ; - Check completeness patient record , accuracy entry database , adherence protocol , SOPs Good Clinical Practice . Monitoring standard require full verification presence inform consent , adherence inclusion/exclusion criterion , documentation serious adverse event ( SAEs ) , record data use primary safety variable . The investigator must give CCC access relevant source document confirm consistency CRF database entry . For particular trial , document file within isolation ward destroy order avoid contamination . Data record document destroyed define study start . investigator put particular focus structure communication , , together principal investigator partner , define communication plan include key communication area meeting , training , telephone conference , internal project meeting , monitoring plan meeting report update . Investigators clinical site keep hard copy Trial Master File ( TMF ) , contain essential technical ( protocol , SOPs , etc . ) , regulatory ( insurance , IRB approval , task delegation description , bio-sketches , agreement , etc . ) trial document . The country CPM responsible checking file contain hard copy TMF document trial clinic CCC up-to-date . All TMF document also make available online investigator private website ( `` eTMF '' ) . The international CPM responsible routinely update documentation trial website . Data management The CTU develop December 1st , 2014 : A case report form ( CRF ) : data collect hard copy CRF . The medical investigator his/her designate representative responsible filling form . A database : Data enter online system ensure data encryption , restrict access database , daily back-up , track edits . A Data Management Plan ( DMP ) Data Validation Plan ( DVP ) , include quality control process ensure completeness , validity , consistency , timeliness accuracy . Training provide member study team involve data collection data entry , data check monitoring .
