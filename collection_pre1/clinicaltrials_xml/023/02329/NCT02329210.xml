	<brief_summary>Bardet-Biedl Syndrome ( BBS ) rare genetic disorder associate vast array symptom . The feature BBS highly variable , even sibling , make long-term follow-up centralization information vital well understand complex disease design effective treatment . Marshfield Clinic develop Clinical Registry Investigating Bardet-Biedl Syndrome ( CRIBBS ) gather comprehensive health information patient diagnose BBS single repository . This information use inform patient , family , physician complex feature BBS serve platform researcher develop effective targeted treatment strategy patient BBS . CRIBBS web-based , confidential database privacy patient enrol registry always respect . Information maintain database identifiable assign study identification number , name . The registry strictly comply HIPAA regulation . CRIBBS participant may contact periodically information regard clinical trial research study , participation entirely voluntary . CRIBBS bring together complex genetic clinical information BBS patient accelerate research effective treatment , attract additional researcher , make easy researcher identify patient find funding innovative study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Clinical Registry Investigating Bardet-Biedl Syndrome ( CRIBBS ) international registry individual rare genetic disorder call Bardet-Biedl syndrome ( BBS ) . The registry sustain private philanthropic funding source . The primary objective establish sustain CRIBBS enable clinical natural history study therapeutic trial individual BBS . Participation CRIBBS open individual meet diagnostic criterion BBS and/or genetic confirmation condition . Identification recruitment member accomplish two approach . First , family support organization share information regard CRIBBS encourage enrollment registry . Second , website develop participant , family health care provider . This website provide portal registration well medical new information impact health care individual BBS . Selection Enrollment Participants : A website portal www.bbs-registry.org facilitates voluntary registration interested individual . A CRIBBS coordinator contact individual and/or family establish participant meet publish diagnostic criterion and/or genetic criterion BBS . Individuals meet criterion consent assigned unique identifier . Data collection : Consented participant and/or parent/guardian interview CRIBBS coordinator collect demographic information well completion health questionnaire . Because CRIBBS international study participant geographically dispersed individual interview use secure telephone Internet service . Participants also ask complete behavioral health survey . Health information provider treatment facility obtain appropriate authorization . The CRIBBS coordinator conduct annual update health information behavioral health survey repeat . Data Safety Monitoring : - Participant confidentiality : Participation CRIBBS voluntary every effort make ensure participant privacy . Interviews participant carry CRIBBS coordinator close room . Personal Health Information obtain health information abstraction store securely double lock environment destroy follow data abstraction . CRIBBS make use primarily electronic database password protect accessible CRIBBS staff member . - Data use : Participant information use inform researcher natural history BBS , refine research initiative facilitate new therapy individual BBS . De-identified data share Global Rare Diseases Registry Data Repository ( GRDR ) maintain National Center Advancing Translational Sciences National Institutes Health researcher organization approve CRIBBS board director . - Registry Oversight : The Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation Institutional Review Board provide oversight CRIBBS registry CRIBBS board director determine direction focus registry .</detailed_description>
