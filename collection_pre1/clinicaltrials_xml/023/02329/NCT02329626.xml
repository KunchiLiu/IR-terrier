	<brief_summary>The main objective study make first evaluation relationship metabolic abnormality objectify Positron emission tomography 2-deoxy-2- [ fluorine-18 ] fluoro- D-glucose integrate compute tomography ( PET CT 18 FDH ) perform rest onset symptom patient first episode motor conversion disorder persistence motor disability 6 month measure modified Rankin score ( mRS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Anomolies Associated With 6 Month Clinical Evolution Patients Suffering From Motor Conversion Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objective study : A . To assess whether metabolic abnormality objectify PET CT 18 FDH perform rest onset symptom may predictive persistent disability 6 month measure EDSS , NIHSS WHO status . B . To assess whether metabolic abnormality objectify PET CT 18 FDH perform rest 3 month diagnosis may predictive persistent motor disability 6 month ( EDSS , NIHSS , mRS , WHO ) C. To search characterize abnormality metabolism objectify initial PET CT 18 FDH predictive persistent motor disability 3 month . D. To determine persistent metabolic abnormality 3 month post-diagnosis independently clinical course ( marker trait ) . E. Define brain area whose metabolism often alter patient motor conversion disorder . F. Establish collection biological sample patient future research study prognostic biomarkers motor conversion disorder .</detailed_description>
