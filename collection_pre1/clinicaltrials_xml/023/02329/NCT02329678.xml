	<detailed_description>Title : Efficacy guide tissue regeneration membrane heal apicomarginal defect - A prospective , control clinical trial . Apicomarginal defect , localize bony defect characterise total deficiency alveolar bone entire root length , report low success rate range 27-37 % ( 1-2 ) . It propose formation long junctional epithelium heal phase dehisce root surface may contribute relatively low success rate lesion ( 1 , 3-4 ) . Successful treatment may , thus , depend elimination bacteria root canal system also prevent epithelial proliferation along denuded root surface . GTRtechniques barrier membrane propose important adjunct management endodontic-periodontal lesion . Such membrane , place bony defect , may prevent downgrowth epithelial cell provide opportunity cell periodontal ligament endosteum regenerate lose tissue ( 5-6 ) . Literature replete case report clinical study ( 7-18 ) demonstrate high success GTR membrane , advocate use apicomarginal defect ( 19-20 ) . However , caution must exercise draw clinically relevant conclusion none clinical study control group . To best investigator knowledge , three experimental study ( 21-23 ) evaluate utility guide tissue regeneration apicomarginal defect . While two advocated use membrane lesion , one could find significant benefit GTR . Kim et al ( 24 ) , recent prospective clinical study , report 73.7 % heal success use calcium sulphate collatape ( resorbable collagen membrane ) periapical lesion complete denudement buccal bone plate ( type F ) 63.6 % success even membrane used E type lesion . Recently , Song et al ( 25 ) also report 70.4 % heal success apicomarginal defect without use GTR technique.These data suggest possibility heal apicomarginal defect without use GTR technique , use modern microsurgical technique . There still inadequate information available regard suitability GTR therapy periradicular surgery case apicomarginal defect . Only two randomized-clinical trial ( 17-18 ) evaluate heal response GTR material treatment apicomarginal defect . However , case previously mention clinical study , include control group . Therefore , purpose prospective , control clinical trial evaluate role collagen membrane GTR material heal apicomarginal defect . Materials Methods Subject Enrollment Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria This clinical trial conduct obtain ethical approval Institutional Ethics Board Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma University Health Sciences , Rohtak . Forty study subject recruit pool patient refer Department Conservative Dentistry Post Graduate Institute Dental Sciences , Rohtak , India , January 2012 January 2013 . The age patient range 16 47 year . Eligibility criterion include apicomarginal communication confine buccal aspect pocket depth ( PD ) &gt; 6 mm recurrent episode purulent discharge , teeth negative response vitality test , radiographic evidence periapical radiolucencies , fail previous root canal treatment retreatment least 1 year previously , adequate final restoration clinical evidence coronal leakage . Teeth vertical root fracture , resorptive process extend apical third root , subject chronic generalize periodontitis , systemic disease contraindicate surgical procedure , condition affect rate heal like diabetes smoke exclude study . All patient duly informed nature study , procedure involve associated risk benefit obtain write consent . The minimum sample size determine 15 patient treatment group basis error α=0.05 power 0.80 . Preoperative Procedures Primary Outcome Measurements After obtain consent , patient thoroughly examine clinical sign symptom record carefully . Each patient receive full mouth scale root planing , , need , occlusal adjustment carry . The patient recall one week baseline examination . All clinical periodontal measurement perform investigator ( R.R ) . The clinical parameter record included periodontal PD , CAL GMP . Each measure buccal aspect mesial distal interproximal space mid buccal aspect involve teeth ( rounded nearest mm ) use Williams O probe . Only site deep measurement baseline take consideration . PD measure gingival margin base defect . The cemento-enamel junction ( CEJ ) apical border restoration , CEJ visible , use reference CAL &amp; GMP measurement . The digital radiograph take Kodak RVG 6000 ( Kodak Digital Radiography System , Pt . Husada intra Care , Indonesia ) use Rinn ( XCP Instruments , Elgin , IL ) parallel device 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month interval . Using CDR DICOM software ( Schick CDR Technologies , Long Island City , NY ) , digital x-ray image divide grid block , size 1 mm2 . Finally , size lesion calculate count number block 50 % area lie radiolucent lesion . Subjects randomly assign GTR membrane group control group without stratification eliminate bias . Using equal proportion allocation technique , seal envelope assign code create another investigator ( S.T ) , utilized randomization subject two give group . It ensure neither surgeon , patient aware group allocation till time placement membrane . Surgical Techniques All surgical procedure except incision , flap elevation , suturing , perform operate microscope ( OPMI PICO ; carl Zeiss , Gottingen , Germany ) operator ( R.R ) . All clinical procedure perform use standard surgical protocol report previous study ( 18 ) . Briefly , full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap raise deep anesthesia osteotomy perform . After debridement pathologic tissue , involve root resect approximately 3 mm apex . 170 tapered fissure bur copious saline irrigation hemostasis achieve use cotton pellet soak 0.1 % epinephrine ( Jackson Lab ( P ) Ltd , Punjab , India ) . Then , entire area dehiscence along resected root surface stain methylene blue inspect micromirrors ( Hu-Friedy , Chicago , IL ) high magnification 26X identify isthmus , fin anatomic detail consequence . Root-end preparation approximate depth 3 mm make S12-7D ultrasonic retrotips ( Satelec ) use piezoelectric ultrasonic unit ( P5 Booster , Suprasson Neutron ; ActeonInc , Mt . Laurel , NJ ) . After ensure cleanness preparation , root-end fill do mineral trioxide aggregate ( Pro Root ; Retroplast Trading , Rorvig , Denmark ) . In GTR group , bioresorbable collagen membrane ( Healiguide , Advanced Biotech Products ( P ) Ltd. , Encoll Corp. , Fremont , CA , USA ) place apicomarginal defect , cover 2-3mm healthy bone around margin . No membrane place control group . Flap carefully reposition sutured nonabsorbable 4-0 monofilament suture . Traditional wound compression avoid GTR membrane group prevent collapse membrane . Postoperatively , patient instruct rinse mouth twice daily 0.2 % chlorhexidine gluconate ( Hexidine ; ICPA health product ltd , India ) plaque control 10 day surgery . The patient recall 4 7 day removal suture time heal surgical site check record . Outcome Assessment The radiographic examination carry every 3 month period 12 month use exposure parameter baseline . Clinical evaluation also do say interval look sign failure . However , PD , CAL , GMP measure 12 month . Follow radiograph compare baseline independently two examiner ( P.S , S.M ) blind group belong . Radiographic periapical healing designate complete , incomplete , uncertain , unsatisfactory accord criterion use Rud et al ( 26 ) Molven et al ( 27 ) . The category confirm data entry two examiner agree heal category . In case discrepancy , examiner sit together discuss arrive consensus . For statistical reason , result obtain dichotomized success fail case . The criterion success include absence clinical sign symptom , complete incomplete radiographic healing . Criteria fail case include clinical sign symptom and/or radiographic evidence uncertain unsatisfactory healing . Statistical Analysis Data present mean ± standard deviation . Statistical test perform two tail interpret 5 % significance level . The statistical analysis ordinal data carry use nonparametric method . Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon sign rank test use unpaired paired data , respectively . Chi-square test utilized evaluate dichotomous data . The interobserver reliability analyze Cohen kappa analysis .</detailed_description>
