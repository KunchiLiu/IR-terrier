	<brief_summary>The propose study aim compare pharmacokinetics bioavailability intravenous subcutaneous Furosemide . Although regimen intend bioequivalent , expect achieve therapeutic plasma level induce effective diuresis . The test formulation study buffer solution , Furosemide Injection Solution 8 mg/mL pH 7.4 ( range 7.0 7.8 ) intend SC injection accord instruction protocol . A commercial formulation Furosemide Injection , USP serve reference drug study , administer IV bolus . It contain furosemide 10 mg/mL solution alkaline pH 8.0 9.3 market IV IM injection . The objective study : - To characterize pharmacokinetics furosemide administer continuous subcutaneous infusion use biphasic delivery profile . - To estimate absolute bioavailability furosemide administer continuous subcutaneous infusion compare equivalent dose furosemide administer intravenous bolus administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Crossover Study Compare Pharmacokinetics Bioavailability Novel Furosemide Regimen Administered Subcutaneously vs. Same Dose Administered Intravenously Subjects With Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open-label , single-center , single-dose , randomize , two-way ( two-period ) crossover study 16 adult subject previously diagnose mild moderate heart failure ( NYHA class II/III ) treat concomitantly oral furosemide therapy dose ≥ 40 mg/day . Each subject complete Screening , Baseline , Treatment , Follow-Up Phases . The Screening Phase conduct outpatient basis 14 3 day prior Baseline . Subjects instruct maintain &lt; 2 gm sodium diet within 3 day prior Baseline . Baseline ( Day 0 ) consist clinical research unit ( CRU ) admission final qualification assessment . The Treatment Phase comprise two crossover period separate 7-day outpatient fluid re-equilibration washout . Following CRU admission , subject discontinue oral furosemide least 24 hour prior administration study drug Crossover Period . Subjects randomly assign 1:1 ratio 1 2 treatment sequence receive intravenous ( IV ) subcutaneous ( SC ) furosemide Crossover Periods ( i.e. , IV follow SC vice versa ) . Subjects remain domiciled CRU Crossover Period Treatment Phase 24 hour administration study drug , time discharge safety parameter acceptable Investigator . Oral furosemide therapy re-initiated discharge Crossover Period 1 ( i.e. , 7-day fluid re-equilibration washout ) Crossover Period 2 . The Follow-Up Phase occur 7 day ( ± 1 ) discharge CRU follow Crossover Period 2 , complete subject ' study participation .</detailed_description>
