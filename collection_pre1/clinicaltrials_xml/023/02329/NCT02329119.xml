	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia consider frequent severe chronic psychotic disorder . Its evolutionary mode clinical symptomatology remain particularly heterogeneous . Moreover , brain process involve schizophrenia still far clearly understood . Current empirical study provide mean duration comprise 1 3 year without specific diagnosis treatment . These diagnosis issue partly base difficulty early distinction schizophrenia bipolar affective disorder ( BD ) . These result emphasize necessity new early index ( endophenotypes ) . Such marker intend specific classical clinical manifestation . In word , absent among patient differential diagnosis , BD . Among possible early index , several electrophysiological disturbance explore . Our study design mainly describe N400 component among patient schizophrenia BD . This component classically interpret index integration meaning linguistic stimulus precede context . Our main hypothesis aim show specific alteration N400 component among patient schizophrenia compare participant BD . The second aim study concern exploration four event relate potential ( ERPs ) among patient schizophrenia BD : - P50 component , involve early sensory gating process , - P300 component , think reflect attentional resource allocation work memory update stimulus context , - P600 component , elicit paradigm N400 , reflect syntactic congruity . - CNV ( Contingent Negative Variation ) , reflect process motor anticipation Regarding potential 'endophenotypes ' status , aim consist compare N400 three ERPs among patient schizophrenia bipolar affective disorder . Since schizophrenic specificity ERPs alteration still remain rarely study , also propose describe possible relation ERPs result clinical score observe among patient .</brief_summary>
