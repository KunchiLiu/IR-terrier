	<detailed_description>Therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) offer possibility individualize improve patient 's pharmacological treatment , base measurement drug concentration biological sample . Conventionally , TDM perform blood plasma obtain venous blood sampling . This method associate several challenge ) need patient travel hospital health center ; ii ) special condition sample transport guarantee stability analyte decrease biohazard risk ; iii ) sample time always represent preferable peak trough concentration ; iv ) method invasive v ) delay outcome analyse regard outpatient visit . The Dried Blood Spot ( DBS ) may offer solution challenge . DBS think offer benefit plasma venous sample TDM . The main purpose PROTECT ( Personalized treatment immunosuppressive antifungal drug continuous home base monitoring Dried Blood Spot sample technique pediatric patient ) study improve therapeutic management patient participation pediatric patient treat antifungal immunosuppressive agent . PROTECT mainly finance ZonMW grant 'Goed Gebruik Geneesmiddelen ' . Four patient organization actively involve PROTECT study . Objective study : Primairy To clinically validate finger prick DBS method compare conventional venous sample analysis 5 immunosuppressive 4 azole antifungal drug pediatric population . Secondairy - Feasibility novel finger prick DBS method pediatric population assess . This include score relevant characteristic ( attribute ) blood draw method TDM , evaluation experience attitude patient parent regard finger prick DBS sample evaluation understand write instruction provide perform finger prick home . The data obtain validation study use implementation DBS therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) less invasive procedure , base discrete choice-experiment part HTA . - To design inventory type cost incur process DBS-based conventional TDM preparation step later health economic analysis . - Data study use construct population pharmacokinetic model optimize dose design new guideline . This observational mono-centre study DBS sampling compare conventional sample TDM steady state situation . Clearly , information feasibility DBS sample child cost relevant DBS sample child obtain actual sampling child .</detailed_description>
