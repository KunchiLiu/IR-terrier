	<brief_title>PK PD Enantiomers Tramadol O-desmethyltramadol Elderly Young Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pharmacokinetics enantiomer tramadol O-desmethyltramadol ( ODM ) extensively study elderly patient . Given importance hepatic function metabolism tramadol potent ODM metabolite fact tramadol primarily renally excrete , age-related change hepatic renal function may affect pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics tramadol . Data pharmacokinetics tramadol , ODM metabolite enantiomer provide important information source difference metabolism elimination Tramadol Contramid® OAD elderly compare young subject . Differences PK tramadol O-desmethyltramadol could result difference Pharmacodynamics tramadol , specifically analgesic effect . An Electrically Stimulated Pain Model use evaluate difference current perception pain tolerance age group .</detailed_description>
