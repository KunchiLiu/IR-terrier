	<brief_title>Change Oxygen Consumption Following Intravitreal Treatment Lucentis ( Ranibizumab ) Eyes With Diabetic Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy characterize retinal non-perfusion area ( retinal hypoxia ) , lead upregulation vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . Subsequently , VEGF cause increase vascular leakage , retinal vasodilation , development macular edema . Based mechanism , oxygen saturation retinal vessel retinal oxygen consumption would reflect degree underlie retinal hypoxia . Injections anti-VEGF agent ( ranibizumab ) reduce macular edema may suppress progression retinal nonperfusion area . However , far , limited information available effect anti-VEGF agent ( ranibizumab ) retinal hypoxic condition . In addition , baseline condition oxygen saturation retinal vessel may provide u predictive information treatment efficacy anti-VEGF agent ( ranibizumab ) diabetic macular edema . Recent report suggest anti-VEGF agent ( ranibizumab ) may suppress progression retinal nonperfusion area . This protective effect would cause increase oxygen consumption diabetic retina . We expect current study use retinal oximetry would show protective effect ranibizumab hypoxia diabetic retina . In addition , previous study show increased VEGF level aqueous humor vitreous , depend progression diabetic retinopathy . The level VEGF aqueous humor would reflect retinal hypoxia may use prediction visual prognosis . This study design analyze effect ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) retinal oxygen saturation consumption eye diabetic macular edema . Each eye treat three initial monthly injection intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg ( Lucentis ) , follow retreatment need , guide monthly clinical examination include biomicroscopy , VA measurement , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) examination . The principal criterion retreatment reduction VA , foveal extrafoveal macular edema serous retinal detachment OCT. At visit , eye schedule examined VA measurement , OCT examination , oxygen saturation measurement . Just first injection ranibizumab , aqueous humor extract pipet . Retinal oximetry perform Oxymap ( Oxymap ehf , Reykjavik , Iceland ) . Briefly , device simultaneously acquire digital image two wavelength automatically track retinal vessel image . Retinal vessel oxygen saturation estimate spectrophotometric analysis light reflect retinal vessel immediately surround retina . Oxygen saturation measurement make major temporal artery vein . Briefly , first second degree vessel use , addition third degree vessel image peripapillary haemorrhage prevent analysis close optic disc . Vessel segment choose analysis use consistently consecutive measurement retina .</detailed_description>
