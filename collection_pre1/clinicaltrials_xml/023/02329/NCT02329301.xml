	<detailed_description>To quantify relative effectiveness , cost , cost-effectiveness fMDA MDA DHAp mass treatment reduce P. falciparum parasite prevalence , confirm OPD malaria case incidence cohort infection incidence area high low malaria transmission program-relevant manner permit adoption adaptation wider-scale deployment . In area stratify high low malaria transmission , 2 round fMDA MDA DHAp effective mass treatment ( current standard care ) reduce malaria parasite prevalence , health facility confirm case incidence community infection incidence 12 month period - Null hypothesis ( H0 ) : There benefit 2 round fMDA MDA DHAp current standard care ( national policy case management ) reduce malaria parasite prevalence , health facility confirm case incidence community infection incidence 12 month period . - Research hypothesis ( HR ) : 2 round fMDA MDA DHAp low transmission season significantly effective mass treatment ( standard care ) reduce malaria parasite prevalence , health facility confirm case incidence community infection incidence 12 month period . The research objectives : 1 . In area stratify high low malaria transmission , evaluate relative effectiveness 2 round fMDA DHAp ( fMDA arm ) , 2 round community-wide MDA DHAp ( MDA arm ) mass treatment ( current standard care - control arm ) outcomes reduce malaria parasite prevalence , confirm case incidence infection incidence 12 month period ; 2 . In area stratify high low malaria transmission , assess percent health facility catchment area ( HFCA ) fMDA MDA intervention able reduce annual confirm malaria case incidence 25 case per 1,000 catchment population , would permit transition passive case investigation approach malaria elimination ; 3 . Quantify population coverage fMDA MDA intervention study area , include identification systematic barrier achieve high coverage , best programmatic effort use directly observe treatment ( DOT ) assure full treatment ; 4 . Assess compare cost cost-effectiveness fMDA MDA DHAp mass treatment area high low transmission ; 5 . Assess adherence take full course DHAp fMDA MDA intervention area high low transmission , best programmatic effort use DOT assure full treatment ; 6 . Assess clearance asexual stage parasite day 7 follow administration DHAp best programmatic effort use DOT assure full treatment ; 7 . Assess acceptability participate fMDA MDA intervention among community member health care leader area high low transmission . The study population include : Population ~560,000 people ~112,000 household 60 health facility catchment area near Lake Kariba Southern Province . Cluster randomize control trial high low transmission area use evaluate fMDA MDA intervention current standard care effect population-wide parasite prevalence ( RDT sensitive assay ) , community cohort infection incidence routinely collect confirmed malaria case incidence . The primary outcome : 1 . Parasite prevalence high transmission season among child &lt; 6 year old ( exclude neonate &lt; 1 month ) 2 . Pf infection incidence rate among individual â‰¥3 month 3 . Total confirm outpatient ( OPD ) malaria case incidence inpatient ( IPD ) malaria case incidence among age 4 . RDT test positivity rate fMDA MDA intervention ( plus control group ) 5 . Population coverage fMDA MDA intervention round The entire population include study ; intervention grouped/assigned randomly accord health facility catchment area ( n= 60 health facility ) , match potential confounding factor . Household survey high transmission season intervention use ascertain malaria parasite prevalence . A longitudinal cohort use ascertain infection incidence rate . The health system rapid reporting system use ascertain confirmed malaria case incidence .</detailed_description>
