	<brief_summary>In study , attempt determine factor associate interventional treatment outcome LBP ( extent ) . Up 346 patient LBP consider good candidate therapeutic interventional procedure give complete history physical exam , include assessment Waddell sign , query regard factor show non-interventional study retrospective study evaluate interventional treatment associate negative treatment outcome . These factor include presence Waddell physical exam sign , opioid use , allergy , psychopathology , concomitant pain condition , 6-point Likert scale expectation , sleep abnormality , secondary gain ( e.g . medical board litigation ) , procedure-related pain , obesity , smoke history . They proceed undergo schedule intervention , limited epidural steroid injection ( ESI ) , facet block positive , radiofrequency denervation , sacroiliac ( SI ) joint injection . A positive outcome define &gt; 50 % pain relief base average pain score 1-month score least 4 1-5 Likert satisfaction scale . Those positive outcome 1-month remain study follow 3-months .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This observational study 3-month follow-up . The course clinical treatment decide physician independent research . Besides filling questionnaire standardize follow-up visit , subject receive care would participate study . The study discuss subject enrol study determine meet selection criterion schedule one injection . They fill questionnaire . All procedure perform fluoroscopy . Following procedure , procedure-related pain report 0-10 scale ( patient receive much 1 % lidocaine local anesthetic necessary ) , include report pain standardized skin wheal start procedure . Patients receive standardized epidural steroid injection ( transforaminal interlaminar ) , sacroiliac joint injection , facet block radiofrequency denervation experience positive block . Details procedures available upon request . No patient permit additional intervention time procedure follow-up visit . Rescue medication form either tramadol , NSAIDs patient opioids , &lt; 20 % increase dose . The first follow-up visit schedule 1 month start treatment ESI SI joint patient , 1 month RF denervation positive diagnostic facet block responder . In facet block patient obtain prolonged relief `` diagnostic '' medial branch block , follow-up 1 month block ( patient may proceed denervation pain recurs 1 month final 3-month follow-up , 3-month follow-up 3 month medial branch block ) . A positive outcome define &gt; 2-point decrease average LBP couple positive satisfaction rating ( 4 5 5-point scale ) . Subjects obtain positive outcome initial 1-month follow-up visit remain study return final 3-month follow-up visit . Those negative outcome exit study `` per protocol '' receive standard care , may consist injection non-rescue medication antidepressant anticonvulsant . Subjects obtain positive outcome 1-month experience recurrence 3-month follow-up visit also exit study per protocol , final outcome measure record receive standard care .</detailed_description>
