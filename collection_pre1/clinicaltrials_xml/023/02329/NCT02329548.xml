	<brief_summary>This study use Alizarin Red powder mixture characterize sweat distribution youth tilt table testing . Patients know orthostatic sweat response prior clinical tilt table test investigator laboratory recruit . The Alizarin Red powder apply exposed skin , quantitative sweat measure thigh . During tilt testing , serial photo take sweat response occur . Sweat distribution compare syncope ( orthostatic sweat ) , period anxiety ( emotional sweat ) , patient POTS ( without syncope ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Qualitative Sweat Distribution During Tilt Table Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator ' laboratory conduct exploratory study quantitative sweat tilt table test past year . Some patient Postural Tachycardia Syndrome ( POTS ) experience excessive sweating . Patients syncope ( without POTS ) increase sweat tilt-induced syncopal episode . Increased warmth sweating among first pre-syncopal symptom individual . Anxiety also produce sweat response , so-called `` emotional sweating '' . Emotional sweat tends affect palm , sol , forehead prominently , distribution orthostatic sweat well-described . The investigator ' sweat measure quantify sweat production , placement sweat capsule limit four site arm leg . An Alizarin Red powder mixture apply exposed skin brown color dry red color moist . Using Alizarin red , quantitative sweat measure , serial photography , investigator characterize sweat distribution patient syncope , anxiety , POTS . Patients recruit sweat response prior tilt table test perform investigator ' laboratory . Consenting patient wear underwear bath suit . The investigator apply Alizarin Red expose skin angle mandible . A single sweat capsule place right hip . Pre-tilt photo take , patient tilt head-upright seventy degree . Once sweat begin , serial photo take . The patient remain tilted position syncope occur Alizarin powder saturate red . If sweat response prominent syncope occur , patient lower 30 minute . The investigator use serial photo describe temporal distribution sweat patient . Orthostatic sweat occur syncope , base investigator ' prior quantitative sweat measure , always associate drop blood pressure . The investigator distinguish emotional orthostatic sweat base patient 's self-report anxiety/panic , presence tachypnea , absence syncope hypotension . The current study aim characterize sweat production tilt test distinguish orthostatic emotional sweat distribution . The primary goal study compare sweat distribution patient syncope ( orthostatic sweat ) anxiety ( emotional sweat ) . The secondary goal characterize tilt-induced sweat distribution POTS patient compare orthostatic emotional sweat pattern . The investigator hypothesize emotional sweat predominantly affect palm sol ( forehead sweat measure ) , orthostatic sweat truncal predominance . This study significant sweat pattern may help resolve POTS syncope phenotypes ultimately aid gene discovery disorder .</detailed_description>
