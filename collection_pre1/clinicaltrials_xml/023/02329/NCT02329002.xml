	<brief_summary>Rationale : Hereditary retinoblastoma survivor increase risk develop second primary tumor ( SPT ) later age ( high risk teen ) , especially irradiated retinoblastoma . The investigator hypothesize regular screening magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) could lead early detection SPTs lead improved survival . Objective : To evaluate potential benefit craniofacial MRI screen early detection subclinical secondary cancer patient previously irradiate hereditary retinoblastoma . Study design : Prospective multicenter non-invasive screening study . The total study duration four year screen plus five year follow-up . Study population : Irradiated hereditary retinoblastoma patient 8-18 year old Main study parameters/endpoints : To evaluate ability craniofacial MRI early detection SPTs , investigator determine sensitivity specificity MRI detect SPTs irradiated hereditary retinoblastoma patient . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Included patient undergo yearly craniofacial MRI period 4 year . They also ask fill psychological burden assessment form visit . A potential risk screen might associate anticipatory anxiety , screen also could reassure patient parent ; investigator sure outweigh . False-positive result MRI screening could lead unnecessary diagnostics lead possible added anxiety diagnostics ( e.g. , biopsy ) . However , group patient high risk develop SPTs , poor 5-year survival statistic . Early detection therefore treatment earlier stage ( small ) tumor , might therefore increase survival patient group .</brief_summary>
