	<brief_title>The Role Levothyroxine Goiter With Atypia Undetermined Significance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence goiter Taiwanese adult find 19.4 % male , 33.6 % female 25 % total 20 year ago even though iodine-deficient area report Taiwan . The result implied goiter become quite common disorder , also deserve investigation , particularly since 0.7 % goiter would diagnose thyroid cancer mean fine-needle aspiration ( FNA ) . However , recent research indicate 5-15 % result fine-needle aspiration directly disclose malignant cytology . On hand , 80 % initial result FNA would appear non-malignant cytology . The common feature find indeterminate cytology , refers 15-30 % FNA specimens . The indeterminate cytology include follicular Hurthle cell neoplasm well atypia undetermined significance ( AUS ) . Based revised American Thyroid Association Management Guidelines Patients Thyroid Nodules , people would refer visit surgeon surgical intervention report FNA demonstrate either Hurthle cell neoplasm follicular neoplasm without autonomously function nodule ; instead , population AUS goiter receive observation period time follow . Otherwise , would arrange undergo surgical manipulation evidence malignancy suspect . There lack sufficient study offer therapeutic option patient AUS goiter around world present , especially Taiwan . Therefore , order avoid unnecessary operation perform upon patient AUS goiter provide another effective treatment , well-designed , prospective clinical trial warrant patient AUS goiter . To achieve goal , pathophysiology goiter require understood first . Although actual etiology goiter uncertain , TSH ( thyrotropin ) regard major factor induce formation . To attenuate growth-tropic effect TSH , levothyroxine suppression therapy administer past treat goiter , particularly goiter colloid nodule . Successful reduction goiter volume find publish paper others verify therapeutic effect levothyroxine . However , fact goiter size thyroid sonogram 1cm require examine indicated reduced volume goiter may offer benefit include amelioration previous malignant tendency especially AUS goiter TSH suppression therapy though study indicate routine suppression therapy benign thyroid nodule iodine sufficient population recommend At first , patient age 20 70 thyroid dysfunction relate manifestation goiter , palpitation hand tremor would recruit visited MET OPD ( Out-Patient Department ) would arrange undergo thyroid sono well receive thyroid functional test screen period study . The patient would eligible interventional trial thyroid sonography demonstrate goiter thyroidal function reveal euthyroid status . After careful investigation subject ' associate history family history , drug history diet habit , patient would actually recruit clinical trial sign informed consent . Initially , enrolled subject would classify two major group solitary nodular goiter multiple nodular goiter . Subsequently , two subgroup would identify major group presence autoantibody thyroglobulin . Thereafter , patient would ask comply guideline ATA ( American Thyroid Association ) advance evaluation , fine needle aspiration follow indeed present either goiter 1 cm size le 1 cm regard typical malignant characteristic thyroid sonography , heterogeneous , hypoechoic , increased peri-vascularization , tall wide . Furthermore , patient history family MTC ( Medullary Thyroid Cancer ) contact radiation radiation therapy would arrange FNA , . The patient first FNA disclosing AUS ( atypia undetermined significance ) would arrange receive FNA confirmatory examination one month later soon later patient positive finding AUS twice would allow take eltroxin TSH suppression therapy . On contrary , patient would assign group receive traditional observation follow thyroid sonography well thyroid functional test . These observed patient would receive surgical intervention FNA show malignant potential NUCLEAR GROOVING， MICROFOLLICULAR FOCI，Hurthle cell , etc . As studied patient consecutive FNA report indicate AUS twice would arrange take levothyroxine ( eltroxin , 0.1 mg ) therapy dosage would adjust carefully 2 week per OPD visit . Optimal therapeutic goal would regard subclinical hyperthyroidism constant concentration dosages eltroxin would achieve 2 month . Thereafter , studied subject would arrange receive thyroid sonography FNA 3 month later necessary blood biochemistry study follow . All following information would record well completely . The primary endpoint mean : reduce goiter volume sono &gt; 15 % cytology : benign*2 time ; operation thyroidectomy ; CAD attack ; refractory arrhythmia ; newly DM . The pathology FNA clinical trial would judge Bethesda System Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology .</detailed_description>
