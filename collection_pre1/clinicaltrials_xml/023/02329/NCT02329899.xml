The primary objective diagnostic study evaluate efficiency standardise procedure MBD child adult refer respective outpatient clinic bleed symptom . The following endpoint evaluate : 1 . The relative number precise diagnosis ( accord recognise classification haemostatic disorder ) clinical probability category ; 2 . The number biological test perform per patient clinical probability category ; 3 . The relative number patient specialise investigation low risk group . The secondary objective evaluate bleed event one-year follow-up . Follow-up perform phone call one year last consultation patient . The definition bleed event bleeding promotes specific medical attention ( consultation , hospitalisation , transfusion , re-intervention case surgery ) .
