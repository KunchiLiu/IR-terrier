	<brief_summary>Contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( CI-AKI ) significant iatrogenic complication contrast medium use associate prolonged hospitalization , cardiovascular event , persistent kidney damage increase risk all-cause mortality . When remote ischemic preconditioning apply percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , kidney protect ischemia-reperfusion injury subsequently CI-AKI . In randomised controlled trial , diabetic nephropathy patient undergo PCI part assessment treatment cardiovascular disease randomize receive RIPC control sham preconditioning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( CI-AKI ) significant iatrogenic complication contrast medium use associate prolonged hospitalization , cardiovascular event , persistent kidney damage increase risk all-cause mortality . Diabetes pre-existing renal disease increase risk CI-AKI . Remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) non-pharmacological strategy induce transient episode ischemia occlusion blood flow non-target tissue limb , subsequent prolong ischemia-reperfusion injury occur distant organ . These brief , repeated ischemic episode limb confer protection remote site heart , brain , lung , kidney , intestine skeletal muscle . In recent pilot study , use RIPC prior coronary angiography high risk patient moderate chronic kidney disease , author find RIPC significantly reduce incidence CI-AKI ( Er et al Circulation . 2012 ; 126 ( 3 ) ,296 ) . We hypothesize RIPC would protective adjunctive therapy reduce incidence CI-AKI diabetic pre-existing CKD . This prospective study perform evaluate efficacy RIPC prevention CI-AKI among diabetic nephropathy patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention .</detailed_description>
