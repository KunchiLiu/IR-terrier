	<brief_summary>Rationale : Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia ( CIN ) premalignant condition cervical cancer . High grade CIN ( CIN 2-3 ) currently treat large loop excision transformation zone ( LLETZ ) . This treatment potential complication , hemorrhage , infection preterm birth subsequent pregnancy . For reason , non-invasive therapy need . Imiquimod ( immunomodulator ) proven effective treatment HPV-related vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia ( VIN ) may also effective HPV-related CIN . [ van Seters , 2012 ] However , evidence limit study result consistent . [ Grimm , 2012 ; Pachman , 2012 ; Lin , 2012 ] Objectives : Primary objective : ( 1 ) investigate efficacy imiquimod 5 % cream treatment CIN2-3 lesion ( 2 ) develop biomarker panel predict clinical response imiquimod therapy . Secondary objective : assess side effect imiquimod treatment LLETZ , disease recurrence quality life . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize imiquimod effective treatment modality approximately 50-75 % CIN lesion treat without surgical intervention . Study design : Single-centre randomized control intervention trial . Study population : 140 woman histological diagnosis CIN2-3 , equally divide two study arm . Intervention : Patients randomize one two arm : 1 . Imiquimod treatment arm . Patients group treat 16-week regime imiquimod 5 % cream . 2 . Standard treatment arm . LLETZ perform patient group . Colposcopy diagnostic biopsy perform 10 week imiquimod treatment arm . In case progressive disease , treatment end appropriate surgical excision perform . Treatment efficacy evaluate 20 week , colposcopy diagnostic biopsy . A histological biomarker panel develop , consist marker represent host viral factor . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary endpoint study regression-or-not CIN2-3 , define CIN1 less colposcopy 20 week imiquimod arm PAP 1 cytology 6 month LLETZ group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment period set 20 week , order realize adequate treatment efficacy imiquimod , minimize risk progression cervical dysplasia invasive disease conservative treatment group . Based available literature natural history CIN several study cervical dysplasia include conservative treatment group , risk disease progression within treatment period 20 week estimate marginal . Approximately 30 % high-grade CIN progress cervical cancer . [ Peto , 2004 ; McCredie , 2008 ] . This believe slow process , take many year . The annual risk progression CIN 3 invasive cervical cancer estimate less 1 % . [ Canfell , 2004 ] . Ten study identify total 637 patient high grade CIN include either control group , receive conservative treatment 6 week 15 month , follow period diagnosis LLETZ . [ Grimm , 2012 , Follen , 2001 ; Meyskens , 1994 ; Keefe , 2001 ; Alvarez , 2003 ; Garcia , 2004 ; Van Pachterbeke , 2009 ; Kaufmann , 2007 ; Trimble 2005 ; Munk , 2012 ] Three case invasive disease identify : occur study 16 week conservative treatment . Other study show progression invasive disease . One case progression report undefined disease grade follow-up term . The possibility invasive disease already present initial colposcopy ( biopsy error ) exclude . Based result , investigator select treatment period 20 week , control colposcopy diagnostic biopsy ten week . The current study protocol include substantial amendment original study protocol , consist three study arm : imiquimod treatment arm , LLETZ treatment arm observational arm . The purpose observational arm ass spontaneous regression high-grade CIN develop prognostic biomarker panel predict spontaneous regression high-grade CIN . Patients observational arm underwent treatment period maximum 20 week . Histological assessment disease development perform 10 20 week colposcopy diagnostic biopsy . Inclusion patient study hampered observational arm : patient decline study wish treat , rather undergo observational management . The observational arm remove study .</detailed_description>
