	<detailed_description>First , 56 healthy subject distribute different dose group accord recombinant EC allergen dose low high.Conducting clinical trial TB-PPD control arm intradermal injection.Do specific interferon gamma detection skin test，after test 72h±2h 144h±2h . The vital sign ( breathe , heart rate , blood pressure temperature ) , skin reaction injection site ( flush induration ) , local reaction ( rash , pain , itch skin mucous membrane ) variety adverse event ; The vital sign , blood routine , urine routine , liver kidney function , electrocardiogram （before skin test , skin test 144h ）are main test item , Evaluate safety recombinant EC allergy expansion healthy people , provide appropriate dose range phase IIb clinical trial . Second，56 patient TB distribute different dose group accord recombinant EC allergen dose low high . Conducting clinical trial TB-PPD control arm intradermal injection.Do specific interferon gamma detection skin test，after test 72h±2h 144h±2h . The vital sign ( breathe , heart rate , blood pressure temperature ) , skin reaction injection site ( flush induration ) , local reaction ( rash , pain , itch skin mucous membrane ) variety adverse event ; The vital sign , blood routine , urine routine , liver kidney function , electrocardiogram （before skin test , skin test 144h ）are main test item , Evaluate safety recombinant EC allergy patient TB , provide appropriate dose range phase IIb clinical trial . Third，32 patient TB distribute different dose group accord recombinant EC allergen dose low high . Conducting clinical trial placebo control arm intradermal injection.Do specific interferon gamma detection skin test，after test 72h±2h 144h±2h . The vital sign ( breathe , heart rate , blood pressure temperature ) , skin reaction injection site ( flush induration ) , local reaction ( rash , pain , itch skin mucous membrane ) variety adverse event ; The vital sign , blood routine , urine routine , liver kidney function , electrocardiogram （before skin test , skin test 144h ）are main test item , Evaluate safety recombinant EC allergy patient TB safety .</detailed_description>
