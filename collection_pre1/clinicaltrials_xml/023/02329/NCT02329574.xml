	<brief_summary>Chronic pain devastate individual society . In age population , surgery increase cause chronic pain , rate persistent post-operative pain range 10-65 % .In particular , Persistent Post-Mastectomy Pain ( PPMP ) occur roughly one third woman mastectomy . The occurrence PPMP seem strongly determine type surgery , chemotherapy , radiation treatment , suggest individual person-specific factor may play important role . In fact , recent study indicate individual difference pain sensitivity ( psychophysics ) closely associate PPMP surgical/medical variable . Specifically , sensory test revealed woman develop PPMP low pressure pain threshold great temporal summation pain stimuli woman develop chronic pain condition . Moreover , psychosocial factor anxiety , depression , catastrophizing , somatization prominent woman PPMP . These preliminary , retrospective study suggest individual psychophysical psychosocial characteristic could important risk factor PPMP . Accordingly , aim study comprehensively prospectively study woman mastectomy surgery , determine relationship pre-operative psychophysical psychosocial factor development PPMP . Using data , prediction model PPMP develop , thus allow preoperative calculation `` PPMP risk score '' patient face mastectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study prospective observational study phenotypes individual ' baseline pain , psychosocial psychophysical characteristic , measure perioperative long-term change examine relationship psychophysical psychosocial processing persistent post-mastectomy pain development . Preoperative Psychophysical assessment : Pressure pain test method : After give informed consent , PI fully train member research staff administer brief QST session . Pressure pain threshold tolerance assess use digital pressure algometer ( Wagner FDX , Greenwich , CT , USA ) flat round transducer , probe area 0.785 cm2 . Testing site bilateral dorsal aspect proximal forearm ( extremity site ) trapezius muscle upper back ( truncal site ) . For pressure threshold determination , pressure increase steady rate approximately 1 kg/second subject indicate pressure first perceive painful . Pressure pain tolerance determine instruct patient indicate pressure pain longer tolerable . Two trial perform site . Temporal Summation test method : Mechanical pinprick pain assess use standardize weighted pinprick applicator similar describe Rolke et al99 two designated force ( 256mN 512mN ) result painful sensation subjects.1-2,100 First , single stimulation lower force pinprick apply dorsal aspect index finger first second interphalangeal joint hand rest palm armrest , rat subject scale 0-10 . Next , break least 10 second , train 10 stimulus apply premarked spot , rate 1 stimulation/second . The subject rate pain scale 0-10 first , fifth tenth stimulus , rate ongoing pain 15 30 second cessation last stimulus . The procedure repeat use high force pinprick third finger hand . Subjects undergo two trial force , break least one minute trial . Psychosocial Assessment : Preoperative demographic , medical , psychosocial pain questionnaire complete patient preoperative office visit . Questionnaires assess psychosocial factor choose base upon previous association PPMP , strong psychometric validation characteristic , brevity . The Pain Catastrophizing Scale ( PCS ) , validate pain patient control , use measure catastrophic thinking associate pain . Depressive symptom , anxiety sleep disturbance assess use short-form instrument NIH roadmap initiative , Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) , extensively validated study compare result establish scale , calibrate 20,000 person . The Brief Symptom Index 18-Somatization Scale , also previously validate chronic pain patients,107 use measure somatization . Pain assessment : The primary pain outcome measure Pain Burden Index measure Breast Cancer Pain Questionnaire ( BCPQ ) , originally develop Gartner et al use 600 patient previous study . The BCPQ include assessment average pain , pain frequency ( many days/week ) , pain location ( breast , arm , side , axilla ) , Pain Burden Index ( PBI ) calculate . The BCPQ also include question body pain , seek medical help pain , painkiller use . We also use Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) , well-validated general measure pain disability bad pain , least pain , interference . We supplement question assess pain without movement . We assess neuropathic character pain use Leeds Assessment Neuropathic Symptoms Signs ( S-LANSS ) .1 The Pain Coping Questionnaire administer prospectively assay effective coping strategy use patient . Medical , Anesthetic Surgical Assessment : Medical variable , include patient 's functional status , assess preoperative visit . Using Weiner preoperative evaluation center email alert system , hands-on anesthetist and/or anesthesiologist contact inform patient 's participation study . In order ass adjust potential impact anesthetic technique pharmacological agent PPMP , follow data collect day surgery : Primary anesthetic method ( volatile agent vs. IV propofol vs. regional/paravertebral ) , amount type local anesthetic administer , amount opioids use ( latter express morphine equivalent units/hr ) . In addition , information relevant analgesic preoperative intraoperative medication gather . Other potentially confound intraoperative factor vasopressor use/amount , fluid blood administer , total anesthesia time , etc . record . Among group breast surgeon , relative homogeneity anatomical technique tissue disturbance , although variation dissection technique . Detailed assessment surgical technique include primary surgeon , duration surgery , presence bilateral surgery , type surgery ( total mastectomy , segmental mastectomy ) , performance nodal dissection ( axillary sentinel node ) , mass breast tissue excise , length incision , predominant mode dissection , nerve handling , presence type reconstruction . Perioperative acute pain assessment : Initial pain score upon arrival assess PACU nurse staff and/or anesthetist . One hour PACU arrival , patient assess research study personnel , ask rate pain rest , arm movement , maximal deep inspiration use pain verbal rating scale ( VRS ) . The Perioperative Pain Service , comprise acute pain specialist , anesthesia resident , nurse practitioner , round postoperative patient Post-op Day ( POD ) 0 1 . Accordingly , pain score rest , arm movement deep inspiration two timepoints assess . In addition , opioid consumption adjuvant analgesic use assess . Upon discharge , typically POD1 2 , total postoperative opioid use/hours postoperative time inpatient calculate expressed morphine equivalent units/hr . On postoperative day 1 , patient undergo brief bedside QST ( preoperative evaluation , describe ) , PCS , Coping Strategies Questionnaire . Postoperative follow-up assessment subacute persistent pain , change psychosocial psychophysical functioning : Follow assessment make 2 week , 3 mo , 6 mo , 1 year . Patients see primary surgeon nurse practitioner , well collaborator Ann Partridge oncologists time . In collaboration practitioner , assess patient ' degree persistent pain use BCPQ , BPI VRS . Additionally , brief QST psychosocial questionnaire re-administered 6 month 1 year postoperatively . Collection sample future genetic testing : In order obtain genetic information particular site variability may impact post-surgical pain , collect saliva sample use Oragene Self-Collection kit . This procedure non-invasive , safe , effective , widely use . Statistical analysis : The primary outcome measure calculate Pain Burden Index ( PBI ) 1 year post-mastectomy . The PBI one year post-mastectomy test significant association potentially predictive preoperatively assess variable ( psychophysical ( QST ) , psychosocial , demographic , functional , medical surgical variable ) use t-tests categorical predictor linear regression continuous predictor . Results test summarize descriptive statistic unadjusted p-values p-values adjust use Holm 's procedure control family-wise error rate . In term data management analysis , attention pay identification multi-colinearity among covariates , redundant factor may eliminate multivariable analysis . Power analysis : Using cross sectional data , roughly 35 % patient experienced persistent post-mastectomy pain beyond 1 year mastectomy , calculated effect size pain pain group psychosocial psychophysical variable determine . Effect size , assume similar propose study , range 0.06 0.70 . With 200 patient 80 % power two-sided alpha level 0.05 detect effect size 0.40 great , observe 7 variable consider . Further corroborate feasibility adequate power sample size 200 , several small study also detect difference QST patient without chronic postsurgical pain thoracotomy , shoulder surgery , surgery correct chest wall deformation .</detailed_description>
