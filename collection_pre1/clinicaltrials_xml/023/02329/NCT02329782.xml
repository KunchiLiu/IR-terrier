	<detailed_description>This study evaluate effect Adherence Readiness Program ( ARP ) intervention primary outcomes dose-taking HIV antiretroviral ( ART ) adherence undetectable HIV viral load multi-site randomize controlled trial . The ARP base Information Motivation Behavioral skill ( IMB ) model behavior change include ( 1 ) brief pill take practice trial enhance pre-treatment adherence counsel provide behavioral criterion determine adherence readiness start treatment , ( 2 ) performance drive dose regulation mechanism tailor amount counseling ( pre-treatment full course treatment ) individual need patient conserve limited resource . Participants randomize receive either ARP ( adherence counseling session ) usual care . Primary assessment administer screen every 6 month ART initiation 24-month follow-up , make one study examine intervention effect longer one year . Secondary outcome include dose-timing adherence CD4 count . If effective , ARP provide clinician intervention ( 1 ) informs provider patient patient ready adhere well start treatment , ( 2 ) enhances adherence readiness outset treatment full course therapy , ( 3 ) tailor amount adherence support base individual patient need performance , thus efficiently use clinic resource , foster good acceptance provider patient , increase likelihood successful program adoption dissemination . This emphasis efficient use resource complement cost-effectiveness analysis inform policy decision regard transportability intervention potential wide scale use sustainability effective .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . The patient 's provider view patient medically appropriate begin ( ART na√Øve ) restart ART ( ART least 2 month ) , either plan start patient ART would like start patient ART provider patient uncertain patient 's readiness adhere well . Patients currently ART also eligible meet follow criterion , specific type patient : ) patient 2 HIV viral load test past year &gt; 1000 copies/ml ii ) patient HIV viral load test undetectable past year iii ) patient genotype past year show resistance reason virologic failure ( detectable viral load ) iv ) primary care provider view patient good candidate study , understand patient interrupt ART assign intervention . Criteria iii intend define subgroup nonadherent patient take little ART medication , evidence combination consistently high viral load drug resistance . If patient take least moderate level drug still consistently high viral load , would evidence drug resistance . Providers generally comfortable type patient stop medication order facilitate pretreatment , adherence readiness assessment training phase intervention prior restart patient treatment . 2 . The patient 's health status stable . There current acute OI medical condition call immediate ART , determine patient 's provider . 3 . Most recent HIV viral load detectable . 4 . If CD4 &lt; 200 , patient prescribe prophylactic medication 5 . Patient 18 old . 6 . Patient able willing give inform consent . 7 . English speaking . 1 . Patient test HIV+ provider suspect patient may acutely recently infect ( within past 6 month ) .</criteria>
