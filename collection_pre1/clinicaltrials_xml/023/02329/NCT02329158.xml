	<brief_title>Disinvestment Hydroxyl-ethyl Starches ( HES ) Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fluid replacement therapy administer patient require volume resuscitation follow significant blood loss , maintenance fluid requirement . Severe blood loss lead anemia , reduce oxygen carrying capacity , organ failure . Options fluid replacement include red blood cell transfusion , colloid hydroxyethyl starch ( HES ) , albumin , gelatin well crystalloids normal saline Ringer 's lactate . Until recently , use HES London hospital major health science center concentrate cardiac surgery patient non-critically ill perioperative patient . In April 2013 , London Health Sciences Centre ( LHSC ) opt discontinue use HES altogether , base evidence suggest HES may harmful compare alternative fluid therapy . The decision disinvest HES become effective April 2 , 2013 . The hospital longer purchased HES , clinician use alternative fluid volume resuscitation . Alternatives available hospital include Ringer 's lactate , normal saline , albumin . All HES product remove patient care area . The investigator perform before/after analysis impact HES disinvestment use retrospective observational cohort study design , employ data obtain administrative clinical database . Exposure HES disinvestment assume 100 % cardiac surgical patient , , washout period surround time disinvestment , exposure HES assume 0 % disinvestment . The study population define retrospectively term intervention receive time period intervention .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The London Health Sciences Centre disinvest hydroxyethyl starch April 2 , 2013 . The study population include individual undergoing cardiac surgery discharge hospital one two era : Era 1 ( 365 day prior disinvestment HES ) : time period April 1 , 2012 March 31 , 2013 , Era 2 ( 365 day follow disinvestment HES ) : time period June 1 , 2013 May 31 , 2014 ( NB : 2month washout period ensure HES supply exhaust ) . Specifically , study population comprise patient underwent follow cardiac surgical procedure : Coronary artery bypass graft Coronary artery bypass graft aortic valve replacement Coronary artery bypass graft aortic valve repair Coronary artery bypass graft mitral valve replacement Coronary artery bypass graft mitral valve repair Coronary artery bypass graft valve surgical procedure ( replacement and/or repair ) involve two valve Individuals undergo heart transplant , aortic dissection , cardiac procedure list inclusion criterion exclude . Individuals portion acute length stay span washout period ( April 1 , 2013 May 31 , 2013 ) exclude . Specifically , follow patient exclude : Patients admit prior April 1 , 2013 remain hospital April 1 , 2013 . Patients admit washout period ( April 1 , 2013 May 31 , 2013 ) remain hospital May 31 , 2013 . Patients admit discharged washout period . We exclude subsequent cardiac surgical procedure individual meet inclusion criterion study timeframe ( i.e . patient 's data use ) . Individuals enrol randomize controlled clinical trial entitle , `` VolulyteTM Cardiac Surgery '' ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01553617 ) exclude cohort . The purpose study assess efficacy safety 6 % Hydroxyethyl Starch 130/0.4 Isotonic Electrolyte Solution ( VolulyteTM ) compare 5 % Human Serum Albumin volume replacement therapy elective openheart surgery adult patient cardiopulmonary bypass . Individuals enrol trial randomize prim cardiopulmonary bypass machine volume therapy necessary either Volulyte Human Serum Albumin . The study begin October 2012 complete January 2014 , total enrolment 133 patient . The approximate number enrol LHSC 30 . Because study period overlap pre post disinvestment era , individual enrol study exclude retrospective cohort .</criteria>
