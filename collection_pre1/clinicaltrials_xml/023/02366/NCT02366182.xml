	<brief_summary>Failed intubation ventilation obstetrics remain one common cause death directly relate anesthesia . The reported incidence fail intubation obstetrics 1:300 , significantly high non-obstetric population . A clinical screening test high sensitivity specificity prediction difficult airway may help reduce morbidity mortality general anesthesia . Few study identify increased neck circumference best single predictor problematic intubation . However cutoff point test identifying patient high risk difficult intubation clear . The aim study determine optimal cutoff point , validate prediction difficult ventilation and/or intubation obstetric patient . Preoperative airway assessment do include neck circumference . Intraoperative difficult ventilation and/or intubation record . Optimal cutoff point neck circumference calculate Receiver Operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In prospective study , patient assess anaesthetist preoperatively ask medical history include detailed history obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) snoring . Physical examination include weight , height &amp; BMI . Airway assessment include : 1 . Maximum mouth opening measure interincisor gap ( mm ) . 2 . Sternomental distance measure straight distance upper border manubrium sterni bony point mentum head full extension mouth close ( cm ) . 3 . Hyomental distance measure hyoid bone tip anterior-most part mentum neutral position maximum head extension ( cm ) . Hence , hyomental distance ratio ( HMDR ) calculate . 4 . Thyromental distance measure distance thyroid notch inner margin mental prominence head fully extend ( cm ) . 5 . Extended Mallampati Score ( EMS ) sit position full extension craniocervical junction phonation ( class I : Entire Uvula clearly visible ; class II : Upper half uvula visible ; class III : soft hard palate clearly visible ; class IV : Only hard palate visible ) . 6 . Neck Circumference level thyroid cartilage ( cm ) . 7 . Condition teeth ( Protrusion , loose , miss ) . 8 . Mandibular protrusion test detect temporomandibular joint mobility measure ability move lower teeth front upper teeth . Intubation consider difficult Intubation Difficulty Scale ( IDS ) equal 5 .</detailed_description>
