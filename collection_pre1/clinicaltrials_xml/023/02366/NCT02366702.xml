	<brief_summary>The purpose descriptive exploratory pilot study investigate : ( 1 ) sagittal plane hip kinematics kinetics ( 2 ) metabolic consumption/cost , bilateral transfemoral walk passive prosthesis versus powered prosthesis . The pilot study collect data three subject bilateral transfemoral amputation . Differences kinetics , kinematics , oxygen consumption/cost compare passive powered component may indicate benefit clinical application power device person low limb amputation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Male female All cause limb amputation : congenital , trauma , vascular , limb salvage , infection . All transfemoral residual limb length : joint disarticulation , long , medium , short , short . Subjects currently walk entirely passive type prosthesis daily . Subjects walk without assistive device OR single point cane . Highactivity level walker Ages &lt; 18 &gt; 45 year Medical comorbidities exist condition may impede subject ability complete protocol exclude amputation . Current medication pharmaceutical intervention may impede subject ability complete protocol . Any powered prosthetic component prosthesis , include exclusive : Ossur Proprio Foot , BiOM BiOM T2 System Foot , Ossur Power Knee , Ossur Symbionic Leg . Subjects require walker , crutch , quad cane , assistive device exclude single point cane . Lowactivity level walker</criteria>
