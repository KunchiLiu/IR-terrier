	<brief_title>A 12 Week , 3-Period Study Evaluate Effects Dietary Supplement Lipid Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medications currently approve treatment obesity act primarily promote state energy balance - either suppress appetite interfere lipid absorption small intestine . Similarly , may possible reduce inhibit synthesis triglyceride ( TG ) dietary fat target activity diacylglycerol-acyltransferase-1 ( DGAT-1 ) enterocytes small intestine . DGAT-1 catalyzes final step biosynthesis TG abundantly express small intestine adipose tissue . DGAT-1 enterocytes critical assembly TG fatty acids derive food intake . Ingested dietary fat cleave monoacylglycerol free fatty acid lipases gut lumen next take enterocytes , re-esterified TG postprandial period . TG eventually release circulation , primarily transport chylomicron . Thus , DGAT-1 play critical role absorption dietary fat inhibition DGAT-1 show delay decrease re-esterification dietary fat circulate TG . It hypothesize effect may lead decreased deposition excess dietary fat adipose tissue , perhaps due increase fatty acid oxidation enterocytes . The potential physiological benefit DGAT-1 inhibition lead development potent , selective DGAT-1 inhibitor , AZD7687 . Human clinical trial AZD7687 demonstrate attenuation postprandial TG excursion , consistent inhibition gut DGAT-1 . However , compound limit , , therapeutic potential due profound gastrointestinal ( GI ) side effect , particularly diarrhea , nausea , abdominal cramping deem intolerable . Moreover , consistent dose-related treatment effect body weight , glucose lipid metabolism find small trial deem non-representative target therapeutic population . Both cell-free cellular vitro model use identify botanical extract potential inhibit DGAT-1 . In follow-up 7-d parallel arm proof-of-mechanism human clinical trial , four lead ingredient ( 2 g/d ) evaluate ability inhibit intestinal release dietary fat circulation follow high-fat meal challenge use post-prandial TG response surrogate marker . Of four lead botanical ingredient , whole grape extract ( WGE ) reduce fast postprandial TG level ( total area curve 0 6 h ) ~ 7 % 8 % follow high-fat meal challenge . This demonstration efficacy , albeit modest , sufficient warrant continue exploration . Importantly , subject report mild GI side effect , primarily bloat , trial . Combinations WGE botanical extract possess biological activity supportive secondary mechanism might strengthen overall inhibition dietary fat release circulation fat deposition explore . To examine potential synergistic interaction , WGE combine ingredient know act complementary biological pathway converge single efficacy outcome ; case , cellular TG level . Ingredients effect glucose fatty acid metabolism could ultimately synergize DGAT-1 pathway chosen . The complementary pathway target choose experiment Peroxisome-Proliferator-Activated Receptor-gamma Coactivator 1-alpha ( PGC1-α ) Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1c ( SREBP1c ) . In cellular DGAT-1 model , grape seed extract ( GSE ) result significant inhibition DGAT-1 activity combine WGE . The combination index ( CI ) , quantitative measure synergy , indicate strong synergistic effect ( CI = 0.61 ) . Synergy occur 1:1 ratio WGE GSE , ratio induce effect DGAT-1 activity either use alone . The synergy data , together proof mechanism clinical data , form basis conduct presently propose clinical trial WGE level use previous study .</detailed_description>
