	<brief_title>Cryoablation Phantom Limb Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim treat Phantom Limb Syndrome ( PLS ) cryoablation remain nerve stump . The rationale pain PLS follow know distribution nerve , amputated nerve know undergo change surgery may lead excessive `` firing , '' interruption nerve impulse reduce patient pain .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects status post ( s/p ) amputation upper low limb . That , amputation congenital . Refractory pain symptom , follow tissue heal ( postoperatively , post injury ) relate amputation determine refer physician investigator , include : stump pain , phantom pain , unpleasant phantom sensation , and/or undesirable and/or lifelimiting kinesthetic sensation . The character , frequency , location , description , exacerbation relieve element record . Patients question location sensation , pain , movement , burning , tingle , . The location pain correlate correspond proximal nerve stump . Positive anesthetic/steroid block , perform CT guidance analogous fashion cryoablation procedure . Absence infection Absence coagulopathy Ability willingness patient provide write informed consent Active infection Underlying congenital segmentation spinal anomaly result differential nerve root pressure Significant spinal stenosis interpret `` severe '' cross sectional imaging study Pregnant planning become pregnant Immunosuppression History laboratory result indicative significant cardiac , endocrine , hematologic , hepatic , immunologic , infectious , metabolic , urologic , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , dermatologic , psychiatric , renal , neoplastic , disorder opinion Principal Investigator would preclude safe performance cryoablation . Uncorrectable coagulopathies Concurrent participation another investigational trial involve systemic administration agent within previous 30 day . Have undergone previous surgical intervention post amputation may alter target nerve .</criteria>
