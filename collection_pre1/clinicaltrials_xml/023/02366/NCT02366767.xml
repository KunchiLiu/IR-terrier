	<brief_title>Assessment Automatic Closed-loop Insulin Delivery System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study complete two part . The initial part study inpatient evaluation system primary goal assess safety feasibility . This involve 8 subject type 1 diabetes , age 14 - 40 year , admit 60 hour . Plasma glucose level collect hourly test YSI ( YSI 2300 , Yellow Springs Instrument ) . These study perform Stanford University include group sport activity mimic diabetes camp environment . Capillary blood glucose test perform every 2-3 hour meal , snack , exercise , prebed subject research staff supervision day 00:00 , 03:00 07:00 research staff . These data review DSMB proceed camp study . The second part study test efficacy system diabetes summer camp . We test system subject type 1 diabetes , age 14-40 year , attend diabetes camp . There 20 subject recruit , 10 subject randomize control arm Medtronic 530G system threshold suspend ( control group ) 10 subject randomize automatic closed-loop insulin delivery ( intervention group ) . Capillary blood glucose test perform every 2-3 hour meal , snack , exercise prebed subject research staff supervision 00:00 , 03:00 07:00 research staff . The primary aim study generate preliminary data system safety efficacy closely supervised environment challenge glucose control .</detailed_description>
