	<brief_summary>The prevalence hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) United States ( US ) relatively low . However , immigrant population US Asia sub-Saharan Africa substantially high prevalence general population consequently significant risk hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . Indeed , age-adjusted incidence rate HCC US triple 1975 2005 . As population demographic change , 2000 US census estimate number Somalis Minnesota 25,000 current estimate put number around 50,000 due primary refugee arrival well secondary immigration state . There available data Somali immigrant US HBV HCV prevalence , HBV HCV genotypes/subgenotypes , genetic immunologic risk factor predispose Somalis HBV HCV subsequent development HCC . Therefore . study fill gap Somali population understand relative importance HBV HCV infection causation HCC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : To recruit cohort Somali immigrant screen chronic HBV HCV infection education prevention treatment hepatitis B . The investigator specifically : 1 . Establish community-based program recruit Somali African immigrant individual Minnesota screen hepatitis B HCV 2 . Establish partnership Somali African community organization physician enhance screen education prevention treatment hepatitis B HCV sequela , include HCC . Specific Aim 2 : To characterize viral factor contribute chronic inflammation , cirrhosis HCC Somali immigrant . The investigator specifically : 1 . Determine HBV HCV viral status participant use serologic test viral load 2 . Determine viral genotype viral mutation correlation measure liver injury , immune function , liver cirrhosis , HCC . Specific Aim 3 : To characterize host factor contribute chronic inflammation , cirrhosis HCC Somali immigrant . The investigator specifically : 1 . Determine whether variation host immune phenotype measure novel multicolor flow cytometry assay correlate clinical measure inflammation , fibrosis , HCC 2 . Determine whether variation host genotype gene know affect liver disease phenotype correlate measure liver disease severity .</detailed_description>
