	<brief_summary>The potential consequence breast cancer surgery joint pain sensitive disorder , main sign alteration shoulder mobility . Global kinesitherapy show effective increase shoulder range motion restriction . However , literature consider specific manual therapy technique , mean peripheral nerve articular capsule take account . These two tissue potentially damage structure surgery main responsible shoulder range motion restriction The main objective study pilot effectiveness accessory joint nerve mobilization technique order get overview articular capsule nerve dysfunction involvement shoulder motion restriction .</brief_summary>
