	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study genetic analysis-guided irontecan hydrochloride dose modify fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin ( mFOLFIRINOX ) treat patient gastroesophageal stomach cancer spread start nearby tissue lymph node . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Leucovorin calcium may also help fluorouracil work well . Genetic analysis may help doctor determine dose irinotecan hydrochloride patient tolerate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine residual tumor ( R ) 0 resection rate . II . To determine pathologic complete response ( pCR ) rate 36 patient treat 4 cycle neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX ( UGTA1A1 genotype-dosed irinotecan [ irinotecan hydrochloride ] ) regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Response rate ( radiographic [ compute tomography ( CT ) ] , metabolic ( positron emission tomography [ PET ] maximum standardize uptake value [ SUVmax ] ) chemotherapy . II . Chemotherapy-related toxicity . III . Surgical morbidity . IV . Overall survival ( OS ) measure time histologic diagnosis . V. Disease-free survival measure time histologic diagnosis . VI . Pattern recurrence ( distant , locoregional , ) . VII . Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive ( HER2+ ) vs HER2 negative ( - ) difference clinical outcome . OUTLINE : PREOPERATIVE THERAPY : Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute , fluorouracil IV 46 hour continuously day 1 . Courses repeat every 2 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . SURGERY : Patients undergo surgery . POST-OPERATIVE THERAPY : Beginning 5-10 week surgery , patient receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute , fluorouracil IV 46 hour continuously day 1 . Courses repeat every 2 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
