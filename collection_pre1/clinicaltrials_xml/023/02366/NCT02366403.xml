	<detailed_description>Post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) condition develop result exposure traumatic event characterize intense physiological psychological reactivity stimuli associate trauma . PTSD represent substantial proportion burden illness among Veterans . A recent study find PTSD diagnose 13 % Veterans return Iraq Afghanistan . Recent report also highlight PTSD associate suicidality - fact may explain alarm rise suicidal behavior amongst return Veterans . Several study suggest meditation-based treatment may helpful treat PTSD . Sudarshan Kriya Yoga ( SKY ) meditation technique involve sequence breathing exercise show promise treat PTSD . There several line evidence suggest meditation technique provide solid foundation treat PTSD . First , breathe meditation technique offer powerful method balance autonomic nervous system activity often heighten PTSD . Second , promote relaxation response counter hyperarousal result calm approach difficulty challenge . Third , may improve sleep quality . This may important treat PTSD memory encode long-term storage sleep via process know consolidation . It possible disturbed sleep common PTSD ( nightmare insomnia ) lead disrupt memory consolidation . Therefore improvement sleep may lead improvement PTSD . Despite promising finding , meditation sufficiently study Veterans recommend widespread use treat PTSD . The goal proposal examine effect SKY meditation therapy Veterans clinically significant PTSD symptom . SKY intervention compare cognitive processing therapy ( CPT ) commonly use treat Veterans PTSD . CPT give `` cognitive '' version ( CPT-C ) efficacious treat PTSD . Veterans randomly assign one two group ( SKY , CPT-C ; n=38 per group ) treatment deliver six-week period . A `` noninferiority '' experimental design use appropriate trial primary objective show novel intervention ( SKY ) effective standard intervention . Patients ' PTSD symptom monitor across time ; treatment ( i.e. , baseline ) , end treatment , one month treatment 12 month treatment . Other measure take baseline end treatment , include autonomic arousal ( heart rate ) cognitive function include memory consolidation . The investigator also monitor dropout rate high conventional PTSD treatment program . Based preliminary study use SKY Veterans PTSD exist literature , investigator expect PTSD symptom severity reduce follow treatment SKY , effect clinically inferior CPT-C dropout rate higher CPT-C . Such finding would provide strong evidence efficacy SKY treating Veterans PTSD . The investigator also expect improvement clinical measure PTSD correlate improvement memory consolidation , reflect improvement sleep follow treatment . It also likely individual 's response treatment influence baseline characteristic . The SKY CBT-C intervention focus different aspect PTSD ; SKY intervention focus breathe relaxation technique whereas CPT-C focus modify understanding trauma cognitive restructuring . For reason SKY intervention may effective Veterans exaggerate arousal ( e.g . heighten heart rate ) . In contrast CPT-C intervention may effective Veterans cognitive symptom ( e.g. , flashback , attentional difficulty ) since CPT-C address cognitive process . The long term goal project conduct fully-powered multi-center randomize control clinical trial SKY meditation Veterans .</detailed_description>
