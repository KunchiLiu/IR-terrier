	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect bariatric surgery bile acid homeostasis interrelationship metabolic change induce surgery . This study contemplate follow hypothesis : - Bariatric Surgery induce new study state bile acid homeostasis high bile acid synthesis association increase bile acid content . - The major effect bariatric surgery bile acid synthesis observe one month surgery progressively decline first year follow-up . - Gastric bypass increase serum bile acid content , postprandial plasma bile acid response fecal bile acid excretion . - Serum bile acid change induce gastric bypass positively correlate change gastric inhibitory polypeptide ( GIP ) level postprandial concentration insulin glucagon like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) inversely correlate thyrotropic hormone ( TSH ) postprandial concentration glucose . - Changes postprandial plasma bile acid response induce gastric bypass positively correlate change postprandial concentration insulin , GLP-1 peptide YY ( PYY ) inversely correlate postprandial response ghrelin glucose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study conduct adult subject undergo gastric bypass , sleeve gastrectomy endoscopic duodenal-jejunal bypass . treatment obesity . As first approach ( Protocol A ) group investigator determine 7α-hydroxy-4-cholestene -3-one ( C4 ) level , marker bile acid synthesis , fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19 ) , inhibitor expression Cholesterol 7- hydroxylase ( CYP7A1 ) , prior surgery month 1 , 3 , 6 12 postoperative follow-up . The measurement perform group patient medical treatment achieve 10-kg diet-induced weight loss , equivalent one-month surgically induced weight loss . Preliminary study suggest gastric bypass induces great weight loss improvement associate disease compare sleeve gastrectomy endoscopic duodenal-jejunal bypass . Therefore , expect deep change bile acid homeostasis gastric bypass , procedure . For reason , patient gastric bypass investigator determine fecal excretion , synthesis , bile acid pool composition , postprandial plasma response ( Protocol B ) . These variable measure prior surgery one month procedure also group patient medical treatment 10-kg diet-induced weight loss . The expression diverse enzyme , nuclear receptor , transcription factor , transporter well cell surface receptor quantify messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) protein level liver biopsy sample obtain patient time gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy ( Protocol C ) . Those parameter reevaluate liver sample obtain subject within first 12 month postoperative follow-up .</detailed_description>
