	<brief_summary>This study plan learn transfusion human blood component call plasma patient liver problem . Patients ask study liver disease therefore may require transfusion plasma . The dose plasma require reach certain blood clot laboratory target usually determine clinician . Due complexity patient 's blood clotting disorder , determine appropriate dose plasma difficult . The investigator develop dose table base information patient liver disease investigator test see accurate dose tool clinician chosen dose plasma patient liver disease need one plasma transfusion</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Validation Plasma Transfusion Dosing Algorithm Patients With Chronic Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinicians currently transfuse plasma International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) target without understand dose response characteristic plasma bleed patient liver disease . Epidemiologic study show INR infrequently correct target INR value clinician chosen plasma transfusion dose patient liver disease . Plasma transfusion frequently give patient prior procedure active bleed patient population though dose guideline aid clinician reach INR target patient liver disease . Previous study suggest patient liver disease may need plasma patient without liver disease correct give pre-transfusion INR post-INR target . Current physician dosing plasma variable rarely successful reach state INR target . The INR threshold commonly use trigger plasma transfusion Gastro-Intestinal ( GI ) , Hepatology critical care physician institution range 1.5-3.0 bleed pre-procedural patient liver disease represent tremendous variability . When evaluated plasma transfusion dose practice bleed patient liver disease 8 year , demonstrate physician rarely meet stated theoretical target . Over dose plasma patient may lead serious clinical complication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects eligible participate study meet follow criterion : 1 . Admission University Colorado Hospital Denver Health hospital clinical care team plan transfuse patient plasma target specific INR value . ( reason transfusion consider ) . 2 . Patient chronic liver disease define 1 following : Previous diagnosis chronic liver disease OR Imaging biopsy diagnosis cirrhosis ; 3 . Signs portal hypertension ( ascites , varix , hypersplenism ) , 4 . Laboratory evidence synthetic dysfunction ( INR &gt; 1.5 , bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL , albumin &lt; 2.5 mg/dL ) AND â‰¥2 physical exam finding admission associate chronic liver disease ( palmar erythema , spider angioma , asterixis , caput medusa , gynecomastia ) Exclusion Criteria Subjects ineligible participate study meet follow criterion 1 . Patient age 18 2 . Patient actively take vitamin K antagonists 3 . Inability obtain consent 4 . Clinical team desire target specific INR value 5 . Pregnant patient prisoner 6 .
