	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn XofigoÂ® ( also call Ra-223 dichloride ) combine hormone therapy denosumab help control breast cancer spread bone and/or bone marrow . The safety study drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Ra-223 Dichloride Hormonal Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive Ra-223 dichloride vein 5 minute Day 1 28-day study cycle . You also receive denosumab injection skin Day 1 Cycles 2-5 . You also receive hormone therapy study . Your doctor discus type hormone therapy , give , risk . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 2-5 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycle 6 : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing , include genetic biomarkers . - Blood ( 5 teaspoon ) draw test CTCs , tumor marker , genetic testing . - You PET-CT scan bone scan check status disease . If doctor think need , also MRI . Length Study Participation : You may continue take study drug 6 cycle . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : After last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing , include genetic biomarkers . - Blood ( 5 teaspoon ) draw test CTCs , tumor marker , genetic testing . - You PET-CT scan either bone scan CT scan check status disease . If doctor think need , also MRI . If doctor think need , bone marrow aspiration/biopsy check status disease . This investigational study . Denosumab hormone therapy use study FDA-approved commercially available treatment metastatic breast cancer . Ra-223 dichloride FDA-approved commercially available treatment bone metastases . It consider investigational use combination Ra-223 dichloride , hormone therapy denosumab treat patient bone cancer spread bone . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 36 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
