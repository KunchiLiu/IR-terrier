	<detailed_description>The goal study investigate effectiveness tDCS novel pain relief modality odynophagia due mucositis patient locally advanced head neck cancer undergo definitive radiation therapy chemoradiotherapy . Participants randomize one two arm : ( 1 ) Treatment : radiation/chemoradiotherapy standard care + tDCS neuromodulation ( 2 ) Control : radiation/chemoradiotherapy standard care . Patients treatment arm undergo tDCS stimulation day radiation/chemoradiotherapy appointment , prior receive treatment . This occur daily ( 5 day per week ) second third week therapy , three time per week fourth fifth week , twice per week sixth seventh week . Patients also EEG recording study . This occur pre-study visit , first stimulation appointment , third week , 7th week , follow-up appointment ( one-week one-month ) .</detailed_description>
