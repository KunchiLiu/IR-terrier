	<brief_title>Effectiveness Tortle Midliner Positioning System Prevention Treatment Cranial Molding Deformities Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dolichocephaly ( positional scaphocephaly ) define boat-shaped elongated anterior-posterior axis result skull flatten side-to-side head position infant hospitalization . This deformity often take place preterm infant &lt; 32 week prefer position sidelying prone improve ease containment , decrease reflux episode , decrease apnea/bradycardia . Supine position head midline recommend decrease occurrence deformity , maintain midline difficult result gravity preterm hypotonia . Developmental positioning use special positioning aid caregiver education common intervention use address dolichocephaly . Dolichocephaly may resolve prior hospital discharge , case infant discharge home deformity . Despite documentation dolichocephaly preterm infant nearly three decade , study report often occur rate resolution intervention . Prematurity appear common predetermine factor . Preterm infant may experience limited variety position due autonomic instability critical respiratory status . These infant often position prone improve oxygenation decrease incidence reflux . Furthermore , preterm infant demonstrate proximal hypotonia , cause head fall either side gravity supine . Bilateral flatten lateral skull develop result weight head pressure gravity . The correlation low birth weight head flatten establish literature . Researchers suggest deformity preventable use air water pillow . Limited emphasis place body position ( i.e . supine , sidelying , prone ) article . Since period time , use positioning aid developmental positioning use decrease occurrence dolichocephaly hospitalization . Despite intervention , infant dolichocephaly hospital discharge . The long-term consequence dolichocephaly fully know , correlate delay reach skill , tightness spinal extensor scapular retractor , development motor asymmetry . Other long-term effect dolichocephaly evaluate minimally . Elliman 's study demonstrate comparable developmental quotient age 3 compare preterm group control . Kitchen colleague report difference IQ 7-year follow . Mewes colleague , however , suggest shift cortical structure , cause dolichocephaly may affect preterm brain , continue develop rapidly birth . Since American Academy Pediatrics establish widely successful influential `` Back Sleep Campaign '' 1992 , many study establish relationship prevalence long-term neuro-developmental outcome preterm infant plagiocephaly - asymmetric flattening skull due head preference - study determine long-term neuro-developmental outcome preterm infant dolichocephaly . Increased time spend supine , couple fact nearly half preterm infant leave hospital head preference , call updated long-term study effect dolichocephaly specifically neuro-developmental outcome .</detailed_description>
