	<brief_summary>The study evaluate incidence major bleeding ( include clinically relevant non-major ( CRNM ) bleed ) event woman undergo surgery gynecologic cancer apixaban 2.5 mg BID compare current standard care , subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg QD 28 day post surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Apixaban ( Eliquis ) Versus Enoxaparin ( Lovenox ) Thromboprophylaxis Women With Suspected Pelvic Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Apixaban ( Eliquis ) oral anticoagulant treatment prevention thromboembolic event . It advantageous need perform routine blood monitoring test include , international normalize ratio ( INR ) , partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) Factor Xa , determine clot participant receive treatment . Several study show efficacy apixaban treatment prevention VTE . We anticipate efficacy could replicate prevention VTE woman undergo surgery gynecologic cancer . An oral-anticoagulant standard treatment prevention VTE outcomes follow surgery could help improve surgical mortality associate gynecologic oncology surgical patient , improve patient adherence outpatient treatment , reduce VTE surveillance outcome .</detailed_description>
