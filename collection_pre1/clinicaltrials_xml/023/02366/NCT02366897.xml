	<detailed_description>The propose methodology base use computer tablet modify pen . While instrumental element common-place widely accept modern life , context formal clinical assessment motor function psychiatric patient . They also novel clinician . The first stage involve recruitment 20 patient ) age 50 ( reduce likelihood idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ) : ii ) mixed , balance gender : iii ) right-handed : iv ) basic write competence : v ) English first language : vi ) suffer acute psychotic episode . These subject stable dos antipsychotic medication sort least 2 week . Patients seat comfortable write position table present graphic tablet modify digitizer pen wire connection operator computer . The assessor sit slightly behind one side subject 's view . To familiarise subject technique , ask ) draw repetitive overlaid circle b ) write name address , speed comfortable . They ask produce 8 character 'el ' text sequence ( 'elelelel ' ) 10 time write short , standard sentence : `` Today nice day time year '' . The examiner say subject nursery rhyme , 'Mary little lamb ... etc '' ask subject write spontaneously memory . Finally , ask copy standard short paragraph write page . On conclusion , ask complete brief 10cm line , Likert scale satisfaction , assess test situation 'easy/difficult : 'pleasurable/non-pleasurable ' : 'acceptable/non-acceptable ' . PREDICTION : participant find procedure easy , pleasurable acceptable 2 group 10 patient , comply criterion ) -vi ) , expose antipsychotic medication least 3 month ( oral formulation ) 6 month ( depot formulation ) antipsychotic medication indicate . Groups comprise consecutive consenting patient prescribe one two commonly utilised antipsychotic : high potency , risperidone , low potency , quetiapine . Dosages determine clinically responsible medical officer ask maintain standard pattern escalation : twice weekly within first 2 week exposure ( dose restrict ) . They also ask avoid additional medication drug-induced parkinsonism though may use require 'rescue ' basis . Other medication utilised clinical need determines . Following informed consent , prior initiation treatment , subject undertake baseline clinical assessment comprise : standardise assessment mental state ( Positive Negative Symptom Scale - PANSS ) ; standard clinical evaluation extrapyramidal neurological status ( Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale - ESRS ) ; standard questionnaire subjective state ( Subjective Well-Being Neuroleptics Scale - SWNS - design pick later potential medication effect ) . They complete instrumental component . Assessments complete twice weekly escalation phase ( 2 week ) weekly thereafter ( 4 week ) day increase implement . PREDICTION : instrumental method prove highly sensitive development extrapyramidal side-effects significantly standard clinical examination : AND : extrapyramidal effect significantly precede onset antipsychotic efficacy</detailed_description>
