	<brief_title>Dialogue Aimed Reducing Anxiety Patients With Severe COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) anxiety dyspnea describe primary symptom high impact patient quality life use social service . Both pharmacological non-pharmacological strategy aim reduce anxiety patient severe illness challenge low compliance and/or side-effect , emphasize need focus treatment strategy address issue characteristic population severe pulmonary disease . The trial single-centre randomise clinical trial test hypothesis minimal homebased psychoeducative intervention reduces anxiety patient severe COPD . The primary outcome anxiety assess hospital anxiety depression scale ( HADS ) , subscale anxiety ( HADS-A ) . Secondary outcome mastery dyspnea measure Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire ( CRQ ) , Health-related Quality Life ( HRQL ) measure St. George Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) depression measure HADS , subscale depression ( HADS-D ) . The outcome assess follow-up four week three month intervention . The trial population consist patient severe COPD affiliate Department Pulmonary &amp; Infectious Diseases Nordsjællands Hospital . Based sample size calculation sixty-six patient severe COPD associate anxiety randomise 1:1 either intervention plus usual care usual care . The intervention consist minimal psychoeducative dialogue deliver patient 's home follow telephone booster session two week . The intervention base manual , theoretical foundation cognitive behavior theory . The intervention carry nurse . Our primary outcome interest intra-individual difference HADS-A score baseline last follow-up three month . To analyse with-in group difference outcome use pair t-test Wilcoxon signed-rank . Differences group similarly assess two-sample t-test Wilcoxon rank-sum test . Same strategy use analyze secondary outcome CRQ , SGRQ HADS-D. To include point follow-up evaluate development with-in group group use longitudinal regression model . Because expect high number drop out , censure due death miss data due possibly lose follow handle appropriately , supervision collaboration experience bio-statistician . The sample size calculation base HADS-A , pair design estimate drop-out 33.3 % . The trial design aim give nurse health professional instrument clinically applicable prove care patient severe COPD associate anxiety . Positive negative result trial submit international journal .</detailed_description>
