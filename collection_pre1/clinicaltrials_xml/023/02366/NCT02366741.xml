	<brief_title>Neurocognitive Function After Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation &amp; Hippocampal Sparing LD SCLC Patients - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background rational Prophylactic cranial irradiation Small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) aggressive type lung cancer , high sensitivity chemotherapy radiotherapy high incidence local distant recurrence . The brain common site metastasis SCLC risk 70 % brain involvement [ 1 ] . Prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) standard treatment patient limited disease ( LD ) SCLC complete chemo-radiotherapy chest . The treatment include whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) , reduce incidence brain metastases improve overall survival ( OS ) 5 % [ 1 ] . The side WBRT central nervous system ( CNS ) vulnerable radiotherapy ( RT ) relate toxicity may associate irreversible cognitive dysfunction [ 2 ] . Radiotherapy neuro-cognitive function It demonstrate two main region human contain multipotent neural stem cell ( NSCs ) : subgranular zone ( SGZ ) within dentate gyrus hippocampus , subventricular zone ( SVZ ) lateral aspect lateral ventricle [ 3,4,5,6,7,8 ] . These NSCs capable replace adult neuron loss cause various form harm ( e.g . local ischemia , brain trauma , radiation exposure neurodegenerative disease ) . However , extremely sensitive X-rays , thus reduction NSCs may play important role radiation-induced neurocognitive impairment [ 6,7,8 ] . Neurocognitive function ( NCF ) major impact QOL actively study brain tumor patient treat radiotherapy . Many study evaluate neurocognitive outcome patient treat radiation brain metastasis primary brain tumor [ 9,10,11,12,13,14 ] . Radiation primarily cause coagulation necrosis white matter tract cerebral vasculature axonal demyelination damage vascular endothelial cell . Radiation show negatively affect various neuropsychological domain . WBRT show great neuropsychological impairment focus radiation treatment [ 14 ] . Correlation , radiation dosage bilateral hippocampus impairment NCF , find adult patient benign low-grade brain tumor treat fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy ( FSRT ) [ 14 ] . An ongoing clinical trial radiation oncology group ( RTOG ) test applicability hippocampal spar impact neurocognitive change cancer patient brain metastasis . Neuro-cognitive function test Even though many study evaluate NCF relation radiation , consensus regard standardization test selection , time point evaluation correlation biomarkers . Many study use Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) ass neurocognitive function [ 15,16 ] . The MMSE sensitive tool detect cognitive impairment measure cognitive function affect radiation . The NeuroTrax system describe elsewhere [ 17 ] . In brief , Mindstreams consist custom software reside local test computer serf platform interactive cognitive test produce accuracy reaction time ( millisecond time-scale ) data . In case conduct several trail single patient , Mindstreams use different version test trial , order avoid learn bias . Tests available multiple language , equivalence among English Hebrew version show [ 17 ] . After test run local computer , data automatically uploaded central server , calculation outcome parameter raw single-trial data report generation occur . All response make mouse number pad keyboard . Participants familiarize input device begin battery , practice session prior individual test instruct regard particular response require test . Hippocampal spar PCI Recent data suggest minimal risk hippocampal involvement patient SCLC brain metastasis suggest reduce radiation dose area PCI would significantly compromise control brain [ 18 ] . There publish data thus far test effect hippocampal spar PCI patient 's neuro-cognitive function , QOL , survival . Volumetric arc radiotherapy ( VMAT ) intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) use advanced radiation planning software computerize algorithms inverse planning allow differential radiation dose distribution within radiation field . A preliminary dosimetric work radiation oncology unit Sheba medical center prove feasibility generate WBRT plan use technique reduce dose hippocampus . The investigator compare 3 radiotherapy plan ( standard 2 lateral field plan , IMRT plan VMAT plan ) aim give 30Gy brain , 40Gy integrate boost evident brain metastasis ( use magnetic resonance image - MRI scan ) reduce dose hippocampus ( &lt; 10Gy ) accord RTOG 0933 protocol . IMRT achieve good result general VMAT plan , especially patient brain metastasis locate closer hippocampus . The work present EANS European Association Neuro-Surgeonsmeeting last year . Serum biomarkers CNS damage Neuron-specific enolase ( NSE ) S100 two serum tumor marker may use potential screening tool brain injury cause radiation [ 19-27 ] . NSE glycolytic enzyme find CNS , express neural neuroendocrine cell . Elevated level NSE find patient brain metastasis NSCLC . A multi-center retrospective study involve 231 NSCLC patient demonstrate high serum level NSE indicate short survival specific marker metastasis . It think rise NSE brain metastasis patient reflect extent neuronal damage , see follow cerebral stroke . S100 protein nervous-system-specific cytoplasmic protein find astrocyte release serum blood brain barrier ( BBB ) breach . Brain metastases show associated elevated level S100 several malignancy . Serum S-100B also demonstrate useful determine brain damage related stroke . Imaging biomarkers CNS damage Although brain radiotherapy induces white matter change depict standard MRI scan , correlation find change cognitive impairment . BBB disruption early , readily recognizable pathophysiological event occur radiation injury . It detectable vivo/in vitro MRI imaging modality , appear precede white matter necrosis . Micro-vascular leakage ( MVL ) , calculate perfusion MRI , sensitive conventional contrast-enhanced MRI subtle BBB opening , reflect abnormal permeability immature vessel . Treatment response assessment map ( TRAM ) novel methodology , base T1-MRI acquire 90 min contrast injection , allow depiction subtle BBB disruption [ 28 ] . The result calculated map , depict BBB function full brain , high spatial resolution high sensitivity subtle BBB abnormality . Results &gt; 200 patient primary metastatic brain tumor demonstrate high sensitivity subtle BBB disruption ability investigator map depict differentiate various BBB disruption pattern within tumor irradiated area .</detailed_description>
