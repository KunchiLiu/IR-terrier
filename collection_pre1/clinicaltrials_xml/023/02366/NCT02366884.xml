	<brief_summary>The cell behavior investigator regard `` malignant , '' include : cell autonomy ; invasion digestion surround normal tissue ; migration colonization distant organ ; ability develop resistance drug , temperature , radiation ; ability kill host , characteristic cancer cell , pathogenic and/or opportunistic unicellular organism ( bacteria , fungi protozoa ) . Rudolf Virchow ( 1821-1902 ) , father modern pathology , first point resemblance biological behavior cancer cell single-celled organism cause infection . He think , incorrectly , cancer cell cell infect bacteria acquire pathogenic behavior . Others later postulate behavior cancer cell likely due re-expression past trait behavior ( atavism ) derive past evolutionary experience independent , single-celled organism cell multicellular organism originate . In word , behavior pathogenic unicellular organism , include : unlimited replicative potential ; capacity invasion , migration , metastases ; ability evade host 's immune system , generate multi-drug resistance ; kill host , investigator define `` cancer '' one investigator cell re-express past ancestral trait . This reversion de-evolution differentiate cell ancestral undifferentiated , unicellular form name `` Atavistic Metamorphosis . '' This imply cancer cell bacteria , protozoa , yeast . It mean cancer cell express function and/or behavior similar ancestral parent , unicellular organism cell originate . If true , combination drug effective eradicate certain unicellular organism may work cancer treatment . The principal objective study determine whether benefit patient advance , metastatic terminal cancer treat combination select drug conventionally use medical practice kill bacterial , fungal protozoal cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This investigator initiate , randomize , single-blind , response-adaptive trial conduct two site patient tried conventional therapy fail refused conventional therapy . This study conduct determine efficacy combination market drug unicellular organism cancer treatment . The product investigation include FDA- SSA-approved anti-bacterial , anti-fungal anti-protozoan drug document anti-cancer property . The drug study compatible , use pharmacological dosage know tolerable safe human and/or cancer patient limited adverse effect . Patients receive treatment 10 12 month . The duration treatment depend drug investigate . It hypothesize regression occur within 6 month treatment continue assumption may prevent recurrence . Outcomes measure objectively assessment appropriate type cancer treat . Outcome measure may include 1 ) Changes sign symptom ; ( 2 ) Visual inspection tumor use weekly photograph measurement ( appropriate ) ; ( 3 ) Monthly chest X-rays monitor lung tumor , lung metastasis and/or fluid chest ; ( 4 ) Ultrasound evaluate abdominal tumor ( e.g. , liver metastasis ) , breast armpit lymph node ; ( 5 ) CT , MRI PET scan ; ( 6 ) Tumor marker blood Carcinoembryonic Antigen ( CEA ) , CA-15.3 , CA-19-9 , etc . laboratory study monitor response . The overall goal study understand efficacy atavistic chemotherapy may mediate metastatic terminal cancer regression cure .</detailed_description>
