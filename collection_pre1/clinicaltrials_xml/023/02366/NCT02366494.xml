	<detailed_description>1 . Identify novel exosomal RNA signatures pretreatment predict response ADT . We collect blood sample patient systemic disease pretreatment ( enrollment ) , 3 month post treatment time progression disease ( two year post ADT patient still remission time point ) perform next generation sequence use serum exosomal RNAs derive patient . We plan identify exosomal RNAs signature change pre-treatment ( enrollment ) treatment ( 3 month ) explore effect change disease response . We also plan compare exosomal RNA level patient relapse within first 2 year versus remission 2 year . Among patient progression , plan compare exosomal RNA signatures progression disease signatures pretreatment treatment . 2 . Validate exosomal RNA marker predict response ADT real-time RT-PCR . Secondary objective : Selected RNAs , identify process validate use real-time RT-PCR assay test reproducibility RNA sequencing result . We expect select validate approximate 5 RNA marker predict duration response ADT .</detailed_description>
