	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II study assess impact pre-conditioning migration survival among newly diagnose glioblastoma ( GBM ) patient undergone definitive resection complete standard temozolomide ( TMZ ) radiation treatment , well impact tetanus pre-conditioning basiliximab together survival . After complete standard care radiotherapy concurrent TMZ , patient randomize 1 3 treatment arm : 1 ) . receive cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) -specific dendritic cell ( DC ) vaccine unpulsed ( load ) DC pre-coinditioning prior 4th vaccine ; 2 ) . receive CMV-specific DC vaccine Tetanus-Diphtheria Toxoid ( Td ) pre-conditioning prior 4th vaccine ; 3 ) . receive basiliximab infusion prior 1st 2nd DC vaccine along Td pre-conditioning prior 4th vaccine . A permuted block randomization algorithm use 1:1:1 allocation ratio use assign patient treatment arm . Randomization stratify CMV status ( positive , negative ) , assignment arm I II double-blinded .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DC Migration Study Newly-Diagnosed GBM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A maximum 116 patient resect , newly-diagnosed World Health Organization ( WHO ) Grade IV GBM find eligible enrol . All consent patient undergo leukapheresis resection harvest Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes ( PBLs ) generation DCs . Patients receive Radiation Therapy ( RT ) concurrent TMZ standard target dose 75 mg/m^2/d . Patients experience progressive disease radiation , dependent steroid supplement physiologic level time first vaccination , unable tolerate TMZ , whose DCs PBLs fail meet release criterion withdraw study replace undergo repeat leukapheresis . For patient whose initial leukapheresis yield le 3 vaccine , repeat leukapheresis may obtain minimum 2 week previous leukapheresis ( may repeat need ) pre-pheresis blood work within Apheresis Center 's parameter long cause significant delay treatment patient . The remain patient randomize begin initial cycle TMZ standard target dose 150-200mg/m^2/d 5 day discretion treat oncologist 3 ( ± 1 ) week complete RT . The study cycle TMZ comprise target dose 150-200mg/m^2/d 5 day every 5 ( ± 1 ) week . All patient receive total 10 DC vaccine give bilaterally groin site unless progression occurs . DC vaccine give intradermally ( i.d . ) divide equally inguinal region . DC vaccine # 1-3 give every two week , thus delay initiation TMZ cycle 2 . All remain TMZ cycle continue per standard care . The day first DC vaccination , patient receive immunization 0.5 mL Td intramuscularly deltoid muscle ensure adequate immunity tetanus antigen . Those assign Group III receive basiliximab 20 mg infusion 1 week 1st 1 week 2nd vaccine . At time fourth DC vaccine , patient receive pre-conditioning per assign group ( Group I-unpulsed DCs i.d . ; Group II- Td i.d . ; Group III-Td i.d. ) . A single dose Td toxoid ( 1 flocculation unit , 0.3 milliliter ( mLs ) saline total volume 0.4 mLs ) 0.4 mLs 1 x 10^6 autologous unpulsed DCs saline administer single side groin , 0.4 mLs saline administer contralateral side 12-24 hour prior fourth DC vaccine , always give bilaterally groin site . Patients Groups I II receive 111In-labeled DCs compare effect different skin preparation DC migration follow Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography Computed Tomography ( SPECT/CT ) image immediately 1 2 day injection . Group III undergo migration study , return day Groups I II blood work immune monitor - Groups I II also draw . Groups I II double blind . Group III blind . All patient undergo leukapheresis immunologic monitoring specific assessment baseline antigen-specific cellular humoral immune response DC generation 4 ± 2 week vaccine # 3 . Patients vaccinated conjunction subsequent TMZ cycle every 5 ± 1 week total 6 12 cycle RT discretion treat oncologist . DCs give day 21 ± 2 day TMZ cycle . DC vaccination continue TMZ cycle total 10 unless progression occurs . Patients image bimonthly without receive prescribe anti-tumor therapy . Patients undergo additional leukapheresis generation DCs need continue vaccination . As part standard care patient , upon tumor progression , participant may undergo stereotactic biopsy resection . As research procedure consent obtain separately . However , tissue obtain , use confirm tumor progression histologically assess immunologic cell infiltration pp65 antigen escape tumor site .</detailed_description>
