	<brief_summary>The purpose study address need targeted treatment induce functional structural change brain , ultimately improve neurobehavioral functioning , investigator propose examine therapeutic effectiveness repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) . The objective improve functional recovery person remain vegetative ( VS ) minimally conscious ( MCS ) state 3 12 month severe TBI . The approach determine neurobehavioral effect rTMS , relationship neurobehavioral change net neural effect , identify define neural mechanism related neurobehavioral improvement provide 30 active placebo rTMS session .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>rTMS : A Treatment Restore Function After Severe TBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim ( SA ) CDMRP study : SA-1 : To determine presence , direction sustainability rTMS induce neurobehavioral effect use DRS ( low score indicate function ) . SA-2 : To determine presence , direction sustainability rTMS-induced change functional neural activation whether change correlate improve neurobehavioral function . SA-3 : To determine rTMS effect white fiber tract whether rTMS-related effect correlate neurobehavioral gain . White fiber tract examine accord change Fractional Anisotropy ( FA ) , Mean Diffusivity ( MD ) , Radial Diffusivity ( RD ) , Axial Diffusivity ( AD ) . SA-4 : To confirm rTMS safety severe TBI . The investigator hypothesize difference active placebo group accord average number research related adverse event ( AE ) treatment . To accomplish aim , investigator conduct double blind , randomize , placebo control clinical trial 58 person remain state disorder consciousness 3 12 month TBI randomize active rTMS group placebo rTMS group . The primary outcome neurobehavioral recovery slope measure total Disability Rating Scale ( DRS ) , collect weekly bedside Endpoints 1 ( 15th rTMS Session ) 2 ( 30th rTMS Session ) . The DRS collect weekly via telephone interview three week Endpoint 2 Endpoint 3 ( 3 week 30th rTMS session ) . Secondary outcome include four measure functional neural activation : task related functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , functional connectivity MRI ( fcMRI ) , EEG-Rest EEG-Task . The functional neural activation measure collect baseline , Endpoint 2 Endpoint 3 . Motor Threshold Testing Neurobehavioral measure addition DRS physical measure also collect secondary outcome . Motor Threshold testing , neurobehavioral physical measure collect baseline , Endpoint 1 , Endpoint 2 Endpoint 3 . The additional Neurobehavioral physical measure Disorders Consciousness Scale-25 ( DOCS-25 ) , Coma Recovery Scale Revised ( CRS-R ) , Coma Near Coma Scale ( CNC ) , Modified Tardieu Scale , Modified Ashworth Scale , Spaulding Limb Movement Protocol Consciousness Screening Algorithm .</detailed_description>
