	<brief_summary>- Lowering intraocular pressure prove treatment glaucoma . Medications , almost always form eye drop , mainstay lower intraocular pressure . Eye drop disadvantage difficult administer adverse effect surface eye surround tissue . Lowering intraocular pressure accomplish oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor , many systemic side effect agent relegate drug last resort . Therefore , effective , well-tolerated , oral agent would important addition treatment glaucoma . The hypothesis oral acetaminophen lower intraocular pressure clinically significant degree dose regimen safe convenient . The research important acetaminophen inexpensive , available over-the-counter , well know safety side effect profile .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Oral Acetaminophen Lower Intraocular Pressure ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The study design prospective case series . Before treatment , study subject intraocular pressure measure 8 , 10 , 12 pm 4 pm . They take acetaminophen 650 mg qid 7 day intraocular pressure measure 8 , 10 , 12 pm , 4 pm . Subjects stop acetaminophen return one week later one set intraocular pressure measurement 8 , 10 , 12 pm , 4 pm . The subject receive reminder , phone text message , day visit . Although measurement intraocular pressure part routine clinical care , multiple intraocular pressure measurement course three different day . -- The subject mask intervention . The person measure intraocular pressure unaware purpose study , hence bias measurement main outcome measure , intraocular pressure . - Treatment occur 7 day , time know treatment successful lower intraocular pressure . The basis upon participant would remove would report adverse effect study medication one week . - The rationale choose acetaminophen data may effective lower intraocular pressure . The dose chosen study ( 650 mg qid ) , dose regimen commonly use treatment pain , maximum recommend daily dose 3 gm/day . If dose scheme NOT low intraocular pressure , investigation plan ; low intraocular pressure , study perform find low effective dose . - Acetaminophen several decade long safety record counter medication treatment pain . The dose route administration propose standard . Many participant likely use acetaminophen past .</detailed_description>
