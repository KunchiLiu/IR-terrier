This feature inclusion criterion important since barrier community reintegration may affect impaired balance , cognitive dysfunction , affective dysregulation , across age spectrum . Consequently , study finding potentially benefit young Veterans , also middle age Veterans . The Military Acute Concussion Evaluation ( MACE ) : We use MACE score 21/30 ensure participant cognitive ability understand study protocol , therefore , participate voluntarily study . 62 We use exclusion criterion 12/24 Dynamic gait index ( DGI ) ensure patient ambulatory either without use assistive device able measure dynamic balance accurately.16 Past Medical History : The following diagnosis cause exclusion peripheral neuropathy , Parkinson syndromes , multiple sclerosis ; bipolar , schizophrenia , seizure psychiatric illness . Medically stable patient : It essential minimize future medical adverse condition minimize risk drop . Therefore , patient shall consider enrollment meet inclusion/exclusion criterion recommend polytrauma staff VA DCMC . The result VHA TBI Comprehensive Evaluation electronic template review follow IRB approve HIPAA compliant data collection procedure . The TBI diagnosis obtain patient 's chart review problem section physician 's note .</criteria>
