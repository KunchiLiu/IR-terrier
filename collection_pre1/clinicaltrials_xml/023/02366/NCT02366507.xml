	<brief_summary>Traditional device measure blood pressure include automatic sphygmomanometer ( pressure ) cuff system manual blood pressure obtain auscultation ( listen stethoscope ) . Both technique fail provide accurate consistent blood pressure hypotensive ( low blood pressure ) state , often encountered emergency department intensive care unit . Alternately , invasive arterial pressure measurement time-intensive , painful , expensive , risk include bleeding , infection , neurovascular injury . In clinical practice , Doppler velocimetry system occasionally use hypotensive , critically-ill patient immediate systolic blood pressure measurement vital clinical therapeutic management . With technique similar use obtain manual blood pressure , Doppler velocimetry system use place auscultation brachial pulse accurately determine systolic blood pressure . It currently unknown whether additional information obtain evaluation Doppler waveform healthy vs. critically-ill patient . The goal project digitally record Doppler waveform critically-ill patient Emergency Department ( ED ) via standard 8MHz ( fetal ) Doppler probe , correlate Doppler reading current blood pressure heart rate , determine waveform shape parameter predictive hemodynamic compromise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background/Significance : Hypotension common predict bad outcome . Arterial hypotension , define arterial systolic blood pressure ( BP ) less 90 mmHg adult , represent hallmark critical illness . Accurate arterial BP measurement essential deliver effective treatment , guide resuscitation , assess intervention . Non-traumatic hypotension document many 19 % Emergency Department ( ED ) patient patient hypotension 10-fold increase risk sudden , unexpected in-hospital death . ( 1 ) Early hypotension associate increased mortality survivor cardiac arrest , stroke , STEMI , ( 2-4 ) stress need tool rapidly accurately identify BP trend order effectively direct resuscitative measure . Additionally , Doppler waveform may provide additional clue impend hemodynamic deterioration overt hypotension shock ensues . Disadvantages current system - The current initial standard BP measurement hospital via automate non-invasive BP device use oscillometric technology . This method numerous limitation include non-continuous monitoring , miss delay identify hypotensive episode , inaccuracy inability measure BP due various reason include inaccurate cuff size severity hypotension . In one study , 34 % patient BP discrepancy ≥ 20 mmHg oscillometric device compare intra-arterial BP monitoring due incorrect cuff size . ( 5 ) Oscillometric device sufficient use many clinical situation ; however , notable exception include patient severely hypertensive , hypotensive , arrhythmias , trauma , critical clinical scenario , whereby manual auscultatory BP measurement prefer . ( 6 ) Even non-critically ill patient , validation data oscillometric measurement call question . ( 7 ) The alternative oscillometric device intra-arterial catheter . Although accurate , intra-arterial catheter invasive , technically difficult insert , expensive , time-intensive , painful , risk include bleeding , infection , neurovascular injury . Current guideline management critically ill patient suggest intra-arterial BP measurement prefer automatic oscillometric non-invasive BP measurement . Despite , recent survey intensivists , 73 % use non-invasive BP measuring device hypotensive patient . ( 8 ) For reason , researcher investigate new technology replace oscillometric technology ; example include Doppler photoplethysmographic device . ( 9 ; 10 ) Newer technology- The research application Doppler technology measure BP infancy yet fully realize . The benefit device would include accurate , non-invasive mean measure BP critically-ill patient . Due high-risk miss hypotension , possibility exists commercialize prototype broad clinical use non-critically ill patient well . The accuracy Doppler velocimetry one important advantage . In animal study compare three indirect BP measure instruments- Doppler ultrasonic flowmeter , oscillometric device , photoplethysmograph- direct arterial pressure cat , Doppler photoplethysmographic device high overall accuracy . ( 10 ) In clinical practice , initial automatic oscillometric BP device unable obtain measurement due hypotension , manual Doppler technique common practice due reliability reference one study `` gold standard '' . ( 11 ) However , accurate systolic BP measurement one parameter device . The Doppler signal receive arterial flow vessel incredible potential identify strength pulse auditory queue . This well establish peripheral arterial disease , descriptive term use monophasic , biphasic , triphasic pulse identify Doppler . The novel device potential identify `` sick '' pulse determine change Doppler waveform prior hypotension ensues , often , hypotension late course disease process . To date , automatic sphygmomanometer/Doppler apparatus available . This project provide data development novel blood pressure monitoring device enable non-invasive near-continuous blood pressure monitor hemodynamic information critically-ill patient . Data healthy volunteer use standard 8MHz ( fetal ) Doppler probe already collect companion protocol place University North Carolina Charlotte ( UNCC ) . Research Strategy : 1 . Significance Identification shock state overt clinical evidence shock ( i.e. , hypotension ) challenging . Determining whether Doppler-measured arterial waveform serve useful marker identify hemodynamic compromise shock ensues unknown . 2 . Approach Hypothesis : Doppler waveform pattern critically-ill hypotensive patient unique identifiable pattern . Objectives : 1 . Doppler waveform collect brachial artery critically-ill patient present ED overt evidence shock . This pilot study allow u obtain Doppler measurement critically-ill patient comparison non-critically-ill patient collect previously IRB-approved study conduct UNCC Co-PI . Doppler signal measurement obtain 20 critically-ill patient evidence shock ( i.e. , hypotension SBP &lt; 90 ) Emergency Department Carolinas Medical Center . Eligible patient identify Code Sepsis clinical protocol alert PCL currently utilize departmental study direct report PI work ED . Patients legally authorize representative approach informed consent . The 8MHz Doppler probe , ( fetal ultrasound probe ) , apply brachial artery , position adjust adequate signal obtain . Doppler wave form data collect course minute . It anticipate patient experience minimal discomfort throughout process . Expected technical difficulty overcome : The technical difficulty include ensure consistent measurement , data collect investigator clinical research staff . 2 . Develop computer algorithm distinguish `` healthy '' `` sick '' Doppler waveform . Waveform characteristic ED patient compare previously collect waveform normal volunteer . A computer algorithm develop identify distinguish feature waveform ( independent blood pressure ) . We use similar power analysis do Holt et al . ( 11 ) 1 . Algorithm Development : We use MATLAB ( The MathWorks , Inc ) analyze Doppler signal obtain hypotensive/shock patient compare prior obtain healthy patient data order identify unique wave characteristic patient shock . 2 . Filtering : Optimum filtering software design perfect PIs , require quantified audio piezo-electric signal , determine reliable accurate Doppler waveform . Sample Size Calculation Previous study use power analysis determine 18 observation set ( set one intra-arterial BP measurement one Doppler BP measurement ) detect difference 10 % ( deem clinically significant investigator ) intra-arterial Doppler BP SD difference 7.8 mmHg alpha 0.05 use two-sided one-sample t-test . A power analysis perform pilot study . A sample size twenty adult subject ( Doppler record &lt; = 5 minute ) choose ensure sufficient observation . Further statistical technique improve association implement described initial prototype description .</detailed_description>
