	<brief_title>A Therapy Intervention Address Fear Recurrence Men Women With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies show cancer survivor variety unmet need , Fear Cancer Recurrence ( FCR ) frequently report unmet need . FCR define `` fear worry cancer return progress organ another part body '' , describe sword Damocles hang patient ' head rest life . Up 49 % survivor experience moderate-to-high FCR , associate maladaptive cop hyper-vigilance , excessive bodily check reassurance seek . There clear evidence large portion cancer survivor experience moderate-to-high FCR . There paucity literature psychosocial intervention address FCR . To date , one publish intervention examine fear disease progression , concept related FCR . Herschbach colleague examine effect cognitive-behavioural group therapy supportive existential group therapy patient cancer arthritis . Results indicate intervention successfully reduce fear disease progression patient compare control group . However , intervention effective cancer patient . Humphris Ozakinci develop AFTER intervention address FCR head neck cancer patient , although result study yet publish . Thewes colleague develop pilot-tested Conquer Fear Intervention , aim address FCR breast colorectal cancer patient . This intervention currently evaluate RCT . As result lack publish intervention order address need patient moderate-to-high FCR , Lebel Maheu design cognitive-existential group intervention treat FCR . Lebel colleague adapt component intervention develop Kissane colleague . The intervention consist six consecutive , 1.5-hour weekly group therapy session , homework exercise assign week . The author pilot-tested intervention breast ovarian cancer participant ( n=44 ) , result study demonstrated significant improvement , moderate effect size pre-and post-testing FCR ( 0.73 ) , cancer-specific distress ( 0.38 ) , quality life ( 0.54 ) , uncertainty ( 0.41 ) , cop strategy ( 0.16-0.27 ) . Almost change sustain 3-month follow-up . It appear individual therapeutic intervention exist men woman specifically address FCR . The propose study address gap literature adapt aforementioned FCR group intervention individual therapy format . The research design randomize control trial ( RCT ) . This study two-arm , pre-post pilot study . Participants randomize either intervention arm wait-list control arm . Individuals randomize intervention arm receive six-week cognitive-existential intervention , individual randomize control arm receive standard care The Ottawa Hospital wait-listed intervention . Participants assign control group inform begin study option participate intervention complete control arm component ( 6 week later ) . Participants ask complete series questionnaire package . There 3 measurement occasion participant randomize intervention group : one week prior intervention ( pre-therapy meeting ) , one week end intervention , 3 month follow end intervention . There 4 measurement occasion participant randomize control group : 6 week prior intervention ( pre-therapy meeting ) , immediately intervention begin , one week end intervention , 3 month follow end intervention . Twenty ( n=20 ) male female cancer survivor great Ottawa region recruit study . The aim recruit 10 male 10 female mixed cancer group . Participants recruit The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre ( TOHCC ) . Participants recruit TOHCC personalize letter , TOHCC circle care staff member , post study poster throughout TOHCC , display study poster various cancer organization ( e.g. , Maplesoft Centre ) , use OHRI 's OBIEE tool . Individuals reach personalized letter , study poster , email option contact research assistant via telephone information study . Participants complete patient information contact form ask either return form healthcare provider , place form return box locate TOHCC wait room . For individual complete patient information contact form , research assistant collect form contact interested participant . Additionally , investigator use OHRI 's OBIEE tool search patient cancer diagnose complete TOH Consent Contacted Research Purposes . The investigator use date range January 2010-August 2014 . The investigator identify pool potential candidate participation request MOSAIC data The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre . Once investigator list patient , screen patient chart eligibility compile list potential participant appear good candidate study . Patients consent contacted research may contact directly member research team treat oncologist inform study . Any patient investigator find signed consent contact research , member circle care ( e.g. , oncologist nurse ) make first contact patient interested learn study contact research coordinator . Participants screen eligibility via telephone , pre-therapy appointment set eligibility criterion meet . During pre-therapy appointment , therapists assess participant suitable therapy , administer consent form Mini-Mental State Examination , discuss general expectation , prepare participant intervention . Once consent form sign , participant assign participant number . All consent form store secure , locked room Ottawa Hospital , access research team . G*Power 3.1.5 used calculate necessary sample size repeat measure ANOVA , factor , two group ( intervention group standard care control group ) , two measurement time point ( pre- post-intervention ) , use effect size find Lebel colleague ' pilot study 0.72 ( Ï†=.80 , p &lt; .05 ) . To obtain effect size , sample 14 participant require . While 14 participant minimum number detect difference group base parameter , approximately 20 participant recruit , order account attrition . Prior randomization , follow form complete eligible consent participant : 1 ) eligibility form 2 ) pre-therapy checklist 3 ) consent form . Participants randomly assign one two study arm . Participants first stratify gender prior randomization procedure , ensure equal number men woman arm . Random assignment start time implement via online random number generator ( http : //www.randomizer.org ) 20 participant . An individual expertise randomization outside research team conduct random assignment use computerized procedure keep generated list , ensure participant assignment could identify anyone research team . During pre-therapy meeting , consent form explain participant . Once consent form sign , participant ask complete first questionnaire package pre-therapy meeting . After completion questionnaire , therapist phone aforementioned individual previously generate randomization list find group participant assign . The therapist inform participant group randomize , proceed book next appointment ( i.e. , either one week randomize intervention group , 6 week randomize control group ) .Participants give choice complete online paper-based questionnaire . Participants ask complete first questionnaire pre-therapy meeting . Participants randomize intervention arm inform outcome , schedule first therapy session therapist follow week . Participants prefer online questionnaire email questionnaire package via Fluid Survey , ask complete questionnaire within 24 hour receive survey email .

The session rat adherence content intervention use 1-10 point Likert scale . Rating scale use measure adherence content ( 1-10 ) , adequate processing affect ( 1-10 ) , efficient time management ( 1-10 ) . If adherence le 80 % scale , additional over-the-telephone feedback provide . To maximize attendance , participant tell importance attend six session time inform consent obtain . For participant miss one session , ask withdraw study , much material miss . Participants also reimburse travel expense session . If participant choose withdraw study , terminate without consequence . Reasons termination document . Participants select online questionnaire option assign participant number , provide link complete questionnaire package via Fluid Survey , receive reminder email complete questionnaire . Participants select paper-based option also assign participant number , questionnaire package mail respective measurement timepoint . Total completion time questionnaire package take 20-30 minute . A pre-post test design control group use . In order examine treatment gain time , several repeated-measures ANOVAs conduct , use Bonferroni correction adjust multiple comparison . The independent variable two-levels : time ( pre-treatment post-treatment ) , treatment type ( intervention versus standard care ) . The dependent variable FCR , quality life , intolerance uncertainty , reassurance seek , impact event , cancer-specific distress , beliefs benefit worry , cop .
