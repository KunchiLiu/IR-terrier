	<detailed_description>Current non-invasive neuromodulatory approach like transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) proven efficacious induce transient plastic change human cortex . However , technology poor spatial resolution , suffer depth focality tradeoff experience significant attenuation depth . Thus , effectively target neural tissue surface cortex . Transcranial focus ultrasound ( tFUS ) new promise non-surgical low-energy technique induce transient plasticity high spatial resolution , adjustable focus low tissue attenuation . tFUS use safely effectively neural stimulation mouse , rabbit monkey research show tFUS also safe effective method transient cortical stimulation human . Having demonstrate efficacy human cortical stimulation , next step take advantage tFUS ' high spatial resolution deep focal length stimulate sub-cortical neural structure . Currently , way stimulate sub-cortical structure involve expensive risky surgery . It purpose proposal test tFUS sub-cortical stimulation . The ability individually stimulate small neural structure deep cortex without invasive surgery would broad application basic neuroscience investigation brain structure function well potential diagnosis therapy many neurological psychiatric disease .</detailed_description>
