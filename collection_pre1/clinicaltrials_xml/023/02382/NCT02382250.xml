	<detailed_description>Purpose study Dietary choice influence individual barrier perception health , , therefore , information factor need gain well insight overall dietary health . The aim study examine patient ' knowledge coronary anatomy lead dietary change change perception health pre-specified follow-up time period ethnically , racially , socioeconomically diverse patient population present cardiac catheterization . Study Design The propose study prospective study patient refer coronary angiography . Subjects enrol study complete questionnaire , include information diet , lifestyle , perception health perceive barrier healthy lifestyle . Demographics , information regard medical comorbidities ( include two question depression ) , baseline laboratory data ( already collect clinical purpose ) , angiographic data ( presence/absence CAD severity ) collect . Patients contact telephone one six month follow procedure complete two one-page questionnaire . On follow-up , patient also ask make change diet , use complete dietary survey guide . Both , baseline follow-up , questionnaire administer verbally consistent . The purpose follow-up determine patient 's knowledge coronary disease status affect short- long-term change diet perception health . The primary outcome measure change questionnaire response baseline follow-up . Methods Procedures Subjects study participation include patient age 18 old , refer New York University Medical Center Bellevue Hospital diagnostic coronary angiography , able complete baseline questionnaire . Consent recruitment conduct accordance policy New York University IRB federal guideline . For cardiac catheterization group , attend interventional cardiologist contact determine potential subject willing approach study . Informed consent seek documented subject upon referral . The Principal Investigator appoint designee explain rationale , procedures potential risk theprocedures study participant . Each subject tell participation study describe proposal strictly voluntary , refusal participate alter patient 's relationship physician , study constitutes research , information obtain specifically helpful individual patient 's care . After subject read consent form , comprehension key element study procedure risk test verbal question consent form content . If subject willing participate , subject sign IRB-approved inform consent form . Subjects give copy consent form time obtain . Study Technique Patients meet inclusion exclusion criterion group complete two one-page questionnaire ( uploaded research navigator ) , one diet one perceptions health perceive barrier healthy lifestyle . Both questionnaire administer verbally baseline one- six-month telephone follow-up . Baseline demographic information medical information obtain patient chart group ( outline ) . Information regard medication , laboratory data , procedural data obtain medical chart ( outline ) . At conclusion coronary angiography procedure , information regard severity CAD record . Data Collection The following baseline variable prospectively collect : Baseline Variables : - Demographics include gender/race/ethnicity , body mass index , abdominal circumference , education income level ( race-ethnicity self-reported , variable measure ) - Medical history : Previous MI , previous coronary revascularization , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , peripheral vascular disease , previous stroke transient ischemic attack , carotid artery peripheral artery disease ( moderate severe history prior repair ) , tobacco alcohol use ( collect medical record confirm patient ) - Medications : Beta blocker , diuretic , ACE-I/ARB , aspirin , thienopyridine , anticoagulant , statin , fibrates , niacin , fish oil , ezetimibe , bile acid sequestrant , glucose-lowering medication ( collect medical record confirm patient ) - Laboratory data : serum creatinine , lipid panel , hemoglobin A1c , ejection fraction ( normal , mild moderately reduce , severely reduce leave ventricular systolic function ) ( Collected medical record ) Procedural data : ( Collected catheterization report review film ) - Indication coronary angiography ( determine research team accord data provide medical record ) - Vessels affect - Degree stenosis within coronary artery - Post-procedural recommendation : Medical management , PCI , coronary artery bypass surgery - If PCI perform ( collected catheterization report ) : - Vessel treat ( left main , leave anterior descending , leave circumflex , right coronary artery , saphenous vein graft , arterial graft ) single vessel multivessel intervention - Type lesion treat ( de novo restenotic , chronic total occlusion , long lesion , bifurcation lesion , calcification , thrombus ) , lesion site ( ostial , proximal , mid-vessel , distal ) , number lesion treat - Procedural success ( define residual stenosis &lt; 20 % end procedure ) All electronic data de-identified reside password-protected computer . All hard copy data secure locked cabinet lock office NYU Medical Center property . Data Analysis Data Monitoring Results diet perception questionnaire compare baseline one-month six-month follow-up use paired sample test . This comparison analyze degree CAD define angiographic finding . The risk associate study deem minimal . There intervention change care subject , data collection . Therefore , Data Safety Monitoring Committee require . The investigator review data quarterly basis ( often necessary ) ensure safe proper treatment subject . Subject Identification , Recruitment , Consent Subjects screen recruit referred NYU Bellevue cardiac catheterization laboratory clinically indicate coronary angiography . Informed consent obtain study investigator designate appointee prior coronary angiography .</detailed_description>
