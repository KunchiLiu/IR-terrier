	<brief_title>Non Invasive Cardiac Output Monitoring Guide Goal Directed Fluid Therapy High Risk Patients Undergoing Urgent Surgical Repair Proximal Femoral Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management fracture neck femur elderly population clinical political interest United Kingdom present , current national audit progress look anaesthetic management clinical outcome . It estimate number patient sustain hip fracture reach 100,000 case per annum 2033 cost NHS £ 2.7 billion . Outcomes group remain poor mortality 8 % 1 month , increase 20-33 % 1 year4 . Complication rate group also remain significant 20 60 % patient significant postoperative complication . These complication associate increased length stay healthcare cost , also reduce long-term survival . Improving maximise cardiac output perioperative setting either use intravenous fluid , combination inotropes show reduce complication rate follow surgery variety setting include fractured neck femur . A recent meta analysis optimisation trial show every 100 patient intervention provide , patient avoid complication , length stay reduce 1 day . Importantly intervention also associate harm . In 1997 use oesophageal Doppler guide fluid therapy attempt maximise cardiac output , Sinclair manage reduce time patient operate fractured neck femur deem fit medical discharge 15 10 day ( P &lt; 0.05 ) . Stroke volume significantly increase protocol group , although postoperative complication rate report trial , infer reduce . A similar trial compare conventional fluid therapy versus therapy guide either central venous pressure measurement oesophageal Doppler show similar reduction time medically fit discharge . This trial report morbidity , show non-significant trend improvement subject receive oesophageal Doppler monitoring . One main limitation trial relatively small number , 20 per group Sinclair trial 30 per group Venn trial , yet even small number improvement outcome see . A large trial recently complete use invasive calibrate measure cardiac output , target somewhat aggressive oxygen delivery &gt; 600ml/min/m2 use inotropic support elderly fracture neck femur patient . Few patient actually achieve goal , however non-significant reduction complication ( RR 0.79 , 95 % CI 0.54-1.16 ) however trial underpowered due issue recruitment . The trial recruit 149 patient total date large study examine population despite impact population health service within NHS worldwide . In addition trial describe included recruitment broad group patient could consider low risk post operative complication . Within group elderly patient high-risk group exist . The Nottingham hip fracture score ( NHFS ) validate score system predict patient increase risk 30 day 1-year mortality . A NHFS ≥ 5 associate mortality 13.7 % vs. 3.5 % 30 day ( P &lt; 0.001 ) 45.5 % vs. 15.9 % 1 year ( P &lt; 0.001 ) . It assume high-risk group increase mortality rate also increase complication rate , hence effective intervention would great impact outcomes . An increase number operation repair fractured neck femur perform awake spinal anaesthesia . Technology oesophageal Doppler suitable easily tolerate awake , arterial base pulse waveform analysis require invasive procedure perform . Hence many patient receive goal direct therapy even though may clinical benefit . A recent economic analysis also suggest goal direct therapy group cost effective also associate cost saving . The Clearsight™ non invasive cardiac output device measure blood pressure use volume clamp method develop Czech physiologist Jan Penaz . Using simple non-invasive finger cuff , volume artery keep clamped constant diameter . Changes diameter measure photo-plethysmograph within finger cuff , servo controller applies counter pressure keep diameter artery constant . This allow measurement beat beat blood pressure hence cardiac output also calculate . The simple non invasive nature device make suitable use patient undergo repair fracture neck femur regardless type anaesthetic . It require calibration , would make goal direct therapy accessible group . The Clearsight show valid measure cardiac output .</detailed_description>
