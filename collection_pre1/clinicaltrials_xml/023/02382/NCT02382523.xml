	<brief_summary>IgA nephropathy occurs IgA—a protein help body fight infections—settles kidney . IgA deposit may cause kidney leak blood sometimes protein urine . Proteinuria ( abnormal amount protein urine ) sign kidney damage . Current treatment IgA nephropathy limit Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor medication fish oil . ACE Inhibitors , also call ACEI medication , slow angiotensin convert enzyme blood vessel relax . This study involve study drug , Acthar Lisinopril ( ACEI medication routinely give high blood pressure ) . In previous clinical study , subject IgA nephropathy experience reduction proteinuria consistent use Acthar . Acthar approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use treat patient proteinuria . The purpose study safety effectiveness study drug Acthar give different dos .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participation study may last 2 year ( first visit final visit ) include 10 study visit 8 phone call . Subjects randomly assign one two treatment group : Group A receive Acthar 80 unit injection 2 time per week Group B receive Acthar 80 unit injection 3 time per week All participant prescribe Lisinopril ( 10mg per day high depend blood pressure ) part regular care condition . If already another ACEI , Lisinopril prescribe . If subject unable tolerate Lisinopril ACEI medication , angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) prescribe . ARBs another type medication also help relax blood vessel subject tolerate ACEI medication . Regardless treatment group subject assign , everyone self-inject study drug use subcutaneous ( SC ) injection skin use needle syringe . Subjects trained proper technique use injection take study drug home . Enough study drug give take home ( base group subject ) administer see 3 month next study visit . Blood sample take lab test visit biomarkers ( Screening Visit Visit 9 ) . Women childbearing potential also pregnancy test do . Approximately 4 teaspoon blood drawn Screening Visit Visit 9 . Subjects must fast least 8 hour prior blood draw . The follow study procedure perform : SCREENING VISIT : - Informed consent obtain ; - Inclusion/exclusion criterion assess , demographic medical history collect ( include PCR urinalysis result test routinely do part regular care ) ; - Pregnancy test subject female child bear potential ; - Physical exam ; - Height/Weight collect ; - Vital sign obtain . Blood pressure record . - Blood sample collect study specific test ( aldosterone cortisol ) ( approximately 2 teaspoon ) biomarkers ( approximately 2 teaspoon ) . No approximately 4 teaspoon collect study visit ; Subjects meet eligibility criterion initial screen attempt permit rescreen 2 time , total 3 screening attempt . Rescreen subject must first register screen fail CTMS system subsequently register rescreen subject . Once subject register rescreened , screen procedure need repeat . ; The exact time interval re-screen would discretion investigator . Completion rescreen would great 6 month initial screen date . VISIT 1 ( BASELINE , DAY 0 ) - Pregnancy test subject female child bear potential - The first study drug dose clinic supervision study staff . Subject remain clinic least 1 hour monitoring allergic reaction . - Subjects receive enough study drug ( 8 dose twice week 11 dosing three time week ) take home next visit 3 month . Subjects also receive dose diary keep track dose take side effect may feel . Subjects bring dose diary study visit Visits 2-5 . A member study staff also call subject week first 4 week start study drug ( Visit 1 ) make sure take study drug require , complete dose diary , take medication experience side effect . There 4 phone call Visit 1 Visit 2 . VISITS 2-5 ONLY ( MONTHS 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 ) - Dosing diary collect - Study medication accountability record . - Pregnancy test subject female child bear potential - Acthar medication dispense ( Visits 2-4 ) - Kidney biopsy perform - Visit 5 Kidney biopsy procedure : Subjects go nearby hospital within 1 week complete Visit 5 outpatient procedure do . Subjects ask lie stomach face pillow rib cage least 20 30 minute . Ultrasound may use find proper biopsy site . A local numbing medicine ( anesthetic ) inject skin near biopsy area . The hospital staff make tiny cut skin insert biopsy needle area surface kidney . Subjects asked take deep breath hold breath thin needle pass skin kidney . Inside needle sharp edge remove small piece kidney . The biopsy needle withdrawn , pressure apply biopsy site stop minor bleed usually occur biopsy . After procedure , bandage apply biopsy site . The hospital staff give subject numb pain medicine need . VISITS 2-9 ( MONTHS 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 24 ) - Inclusion/exclusion criterion assess , demographic medical history collect ; - Physical exam ; - Height/Weight collect ; - Vital sign obtain . Blood pressure record . - Blood sample collect study specific test ( aldosterone cortisol ) ( approximately 2 teaspoon ) . Biomarkers ( approximately 2 teaspoon ) also collect Visit 9 . No approximately 4 teaspoon collect Visit 9 ; After Visit 2 , member study staff continue call every 1 ½ month make sure subject take study drug require , subject take medication experience side effect . There 4 phone call occur Visit 2-3 , Visit 3-4 , Visit 4-5 Visit 5-6 . Subjects receive total 8 phone call study . The total amount blood collect course study approximately 38 teaspoon . Treatment study drug continue first 12 month participation study . If subject respond 3 month treatment partially respond treatment , dosage may increase ( 120 unit injection twice week 3 month ) . If subject still respond increase dose , study drug discontinue another 3 month treatment . If subject respond treatment 12 month treatment response go away follow period , place back study drug additional 6 month . If , reason , study drug stop last treatment visit , subject ask come clinic complete study procedure . Subjects ask end-of-study test do safety . Acthar abruptly stop must gradually lessen . Except subject experience allergic reaction , drug administer half dose 1 week , ¼ dose another week , stop . If subject insulin oral antidiabetic medication , Acthar may decrease glucose ( sugar ) tolerance . This may result increase blood sugar . Subjects ask let study doctor know medication discuss glucose monitoring plan keep take medication Acthar experience increase blood sugar .</detailed_description>
