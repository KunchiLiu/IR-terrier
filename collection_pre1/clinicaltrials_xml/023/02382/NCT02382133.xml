	<detailed_description>Continuous pulse oximetry monitor standard care critically ill patient emergency department , operate room intensive care unit . In patient poor peripheral perfusion ( low blood flow ) due peripheral vascular disease , low body temperature , shock use medication raise blood pressure , clinicians difficulty obtain accurate measurement . Several study demonstrate utility forehead sensor measurement clinical condition . Forehead sensor measurement consider central measurement digit ear sensor . However sensor require head band accurate measurement . On regular basis , forehead sensor lead pressure ulcer development Barnes-Jewish Hospital despite follow vendor recommendation alternate placement every 8 hour one side forehead . An alternate sensor place nose recently demonstrate rapid detection induce drop oxygen saturation . It also demonstrate correlation arterial oxygen saturation measure clinical laboratory . The oxygen saturation measurement nose also consider central measurement . However , study nose sensor conduct healthy subject anesthesia care several hour . Therefore , research need examine accuracy nose sensor ICU patient population . In addition , due concern sensor relate pressure ulcer patient decreased perfusion , sensor need evaluate extend period time .</detailed_description>
