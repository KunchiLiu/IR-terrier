	<brief_summary>Proven treatment exist improve quality life reduce risk repeat heart attack death amongst person already one heart attack . These treatment include medication supervise cardiac rehabilitation program . Unfortunately , research show many people heart attack stick treatment therefore benefit . This quality improvement research program seek understand impact intervention could readily implement scale entire health system organization wish improve adherence proven treatment . Specifically , trial test whether provide Ontario-based patient ( health professional ) repeat educational reminder deliver via post phone help improve use medication attendance cardiac rehabilitation . During project , type patient responsive identify cost-effective strategy deliver reminder . The trial team partner project health system decision maker interest use result create standard operating procedure could benefit patient across province .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interventions Support Long-Term Adherence aNd Decrease Cardiovascular Events Post-Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Background : In patient myocardial infarction ( MI ) coronary disease , guideline recommend cardiac rehabilitation service long-term use cardiac medication reduce risk recurrent cardiovascular event . Adherence recommendation substantially reduce morbidity mortality post-MI . However , variety patient , provider , system-level reason , adherence cardiac medication decline approximately 50 % 12 month . Likewise , 30-40 % patient participate cardiac rehabilitation . Thus , intervention increase secondary prevention treatment adherence urgently need . The Cardiac Care Network Ontario ( CCN ) hold registry patient province coronary angiography . The registry use identify gap care plan health system strategies high-risk patient . More recently , pilot trial conduct Hamilton trial team use data registry send recurrent postal reminder regard importance treatment adherence patient , pharmacist , family physician . A similar program underway Ottawa use automate phone call interactive voice response nurse follow . These intervention potential address know determinant adherence . The CCN , Ministry Health Long-Term Care , Health Quality Ontario , stakeholder across Ontario interested evaluate comparative effectiveness cost intervention . Research Questions : The research objectives form decision maker ' need evaluate whether format sustain and/or scale-up post-MI educational reminder intervention : . Can educational reminder deliver via post and/or use interactive voice response personalize telephone follow improve secondary prevention treatment adherence post-MI ? ii . How different approach improve adherence recommendation compare term clinical effectiveness cost ? iii . Which subgroups more/less likely respond reminder ? Research Approach : This pragmatic , randomize control trial blind outcome assessment . Patients cardiac centre throughout Ontario undergo coronary angiography provide letter information explain study append standard CCN letter information . CCN identify eligible patient ( substantial coronary artery disease survive initial hospitalization post-MI ) provide patient list back cardiac centre . A representative centre securely send list Population Health Research Institute Hamilton . Patients randomized Population Health Research Institute team one three arm : 1 . - Usual care , standardize educational material reminder 2 . - Postal letter send Population Health Research Institute behalf hospital 's interventional cardiology team patient approximately 4 , 8 , 20 , 32 , 44 week post-MI , insert family physician pharmacist approximately 4 8 week post-MI . 3 . - Postal letter plus interactive voice response phone call patient deliver approximately 2 week letter , well personalize telephone follow train lay health worker patient identify interactive voice response system non-adherent . Patient self-report administrative data use assess outcomes 12 month post-MI . Analyses intention treat . The primary outcome adherence guideline-recommended treatment . Secondary outcome include health service utilization ( include outpatient visit interventional cardiology ) , recurrent cardiovascular event , mortality . During trial , theory-informed process questionnaire administer random sub-sample . An economic evaluation conduct perspective public health care payer . Implications : This project potential lead improvement care patient high cardiovascular risk well provide generalizable insight regard optimize intervention improve adherence . Further , potential inform health database could use improve health system performance .</detailed_description>
