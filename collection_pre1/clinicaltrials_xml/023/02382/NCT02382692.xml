	<detailed_description>Sinus surgery common procedure rhinology treatment chronic inflammation , tumor pathology . These procedure perform immediate vicinity skull base . The risk injure membrane cover brain way require treatment le 1 % [ 1 ] . Such Injuries skull base could lead loss cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . The destruction natural barrier raise potential risk ascend infection membrane brain nose . Leakage cerebrospinal fluid usually bloody surgical field view always distinguishable sometimes notice postoperatively . The spontaneous closure leaky membrane brain without surgical treatment know . This small trauma skull base often remain undetected . At end operation , thin gauze insert nose side addition usual tampon . The tampon additional gauze remove day operation send tube venous blood laboratory . The gauze venous blood check beta-2-transferrin , biomarker cerebrospinal fluid . During clinical standard control patient ask symptom fluid leak nose . If positive , regardless study , patient must additional CT scan sinuses another blood sample check beta-2-transferrin .</detailed_description>
