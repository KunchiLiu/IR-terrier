	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Study Quality Life Prostate Cancer Patients Randomizing Anti-androgen Versus Total Androgen Blockage Prior Curative Intended Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : To study difference quality life relation anti-androgen versus total androgen blockage . Exploratory parameter : ▪ Time PSA relapse - Time symptom give metastasis - Overall survival Patients localize /locally advanced prostate cancer subject treatment curative intention . They could divide three group accord risk metastasis . Mainly intermediate risk group patient include study . Patients low risk could include subject neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy . Different risk group define : Low risk group : PSA ≤10 ng/ml Gleason score ≤ 6 Tumour stage ≤ T2b Intermediate risk group : Presence 1-2 factor high risk . High risk group : PSA &gt; 10 ng/ml Gleason score ≥7 Tumour stage T2c - T3b</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histopathologically verified prostatic adenocarcinoma . 2 . All consecutive patient refer radiation therapy combination method i.e . external beam RT HDR brachytherapy fractionation curative intention . 3 . Patients intermediate risk group prostate cancer mainly include study radiotherapy intention cure indicate possible perform . The intermediate risk group define 12 high risk factor metastasis . Patients low risk possible include indication neoadjuvant hormonal therapy . 4 . No sign distant metastasis . 5 . Informed consent . 1 . Failure fulfill inclusion criterion . 2 . Severe hepatic renal failure , accord clinical laboratory examination , serum creatinine &gt; 225 mmol/l . 3 . Concomitant disease would influence plan treatment ( e.g . Inflammatory bowel disease , urinary incontinence , severe atherosclerosis , myocardial infarction within last 6 month . 4 . Previous diagnosis malignant disease exclude patient free relapse least 5 year diagnosis . Patients basal cell carcinoma includable . 5 . Inability patient cope study rule , due abuse , mentalstatus reason 6 . Participation clinical study time considers may hamper assessment QoL .</criteria>
