	<brief_summary>Despite efficient antiretroviral treatment HIV infection , decrease life expectancy remain . Excess mortality mainly due non-AIDS co-morbidity include cardiovascular , pulmonary , liver related disease . Both HIV-unrelated HIV-related risk factor probably contribute pattern . At present , evidence regard co-morbidity HIV infection rely cross-study comparison HIV-infected person publish population rate prospective study U.S. cohort . Using well characterize participant Copenhagen General Population Study ( CGPS ) control , aim include &gt; 1500 HIV-infected person COCOMO study determine co-morbidity prevalent develop high rate HIV-infected person . The study asses 1 ) cardiovascular , 2 ) pulmonary 3 ) liver-related co-morbidity use uniformly collect data two cohort . The investigator aim study relative impact HIV-unrelated HIV-related factor development co-morbidity .</brief_summary>
