	<brief_title>Web-based Interpretation Training For Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately half U.S. population experience serious mental health problem lifetime , include 29 % anxiety pathology severe enough qualify anxiety disorder diagnosis [ 1 ] . Critically , two third individual struggle mental illness receive treatment [ 1 ] . With level mental illness burden , clear treat people one-on-one office set never meet exist need [ 2 ] . There many barrier treatment , include cost [ 3 ] , difficulty access evidence-based treatment many region [ 4 ] , associate stigma [ 5 ] . Thus , press need consider alternative , large scale approach deliver mental health service . Cognitive Bias Modification ( CBM ) intervention hold considerable promise way meet need , especially anxiety difficulty [ 6 ] . These computer-based program design alter bias way think , tendency toward negative interpretation , cause maintain anxiety [ 6 ] . Because program require therapist contact administer computer Internet connection , CBM hold promise cost-effective method disseminate widely . However , CBM interpretation bias ( CBM-I ) establish efficacy administer in-person laboratory [ 7 ] , need test broad population use web-based infrastructure examine : ) whether program effective web environment , b ) whether program continue engage target mechanism ( i.e. , interpretation bias ) , c ) feasibility delivery method , ) modification need adapt program web ( particular , prime anxiety-linked negative thinking online environment , test effect add guide anxious imagery exercise prime fear outcomes prior training session ) . Together , current proposal develop infrastructure pilot test effectiveness web-based CBM-I anxiety symptom . CBM-I training target moderate severe anxiety symptom , widespread problem area considerable occupational social impairment [ 8 ] . Participants visitor Project Implicit Mental Health ( PIMH ) , exist website direct Principal Investigator allow visitor assess cognitive bias tie mental health concern . Consistent RFA 's priority , approach encourages efficiency capitalize exist PIMH site heavy traffic . Further , site 's large number visitor use automated assessment make efficient assess baseline demographic characteristic interpretation bias moderator CBM-I effect test future trial . Aim 1 : Develop evaluate usability acceptability web-based CBM-I anxiety symptom . Aim 1 build web-based interpretation bias train program use PIMH infrastructure . We pilot program small test group moderate highly anxious participant ( N=15 ) complete questionnaires semi-structured interview provide feedback program ' usability acceptability . Further , advisory board ( N=8 ) anxiety researcher , clinician , expert CBM web-based research provide feedback program study protocol . Using `` deployment-focused '' approach , feedback expert end-users use iteratively modify program trial plan Aims 2 3 . Thus , even initial pilot stage , measure target outcome ( anxiety symptom ) mechanism ( interpretation bias ) determine whether modification enhance target engagement need . Note , within Research Domain Criteria ( RDoC ) , outcome fall Potential Threat/Anxiety construct within Negative Valence System , target mechanism ( interpretation bias ) fall Response Selection , Inhibition construct within Cognitive ( effortful ) control system . Both outcome mechanism objectively measure use multiple unit analysis ( e.g. , behavior self-report ) . Further , mechanisms underlie guide anxious imagery prime 's effect measure assess subjective distress , imagery vividness , activation fear outcomes follow manipulation . This prime select part potential disseminate widely future trial , give require human contact . Aim 2 : Test target engagement , feasibility effectiveness web-based CBM-I . Aim 3 : Evaluate impact anxious prime web-based CBM-I anxiety symptom . Aims 2 3 test feasibility 8-session web-based interpretation train program among individual moderate severe anxiety symptom ( base screen PIMH site ) . Participants randomly assign positive CBM-I ( 90 % positive scenario training ) , 50 % positive/50 % negative CBM-I , scenario control condition . Half participants 3 condition receive anxious imagery prime prior training session , half receive neutral imagery prime , result 3 training condition x 2 prime design ( N=210 ; target n=35 per condition ) . Feasibility determine analysis recruitment , attrition , acceptance randomization , adherence appropriateness measurement model , caseness , extent miss data , safety . Additionally , target engagement ( change interpretation bias ) preliminary test effectiveness reduce anxiety symptom evaluate .</detailed_description>
