	<detailed_description>The main purpose study determine effectiveness use oral supplementation alpha lipoid acid improve clinical electrophysiological recovery carpal tunnel release surgery . This research design double blind clinical trial , calculate sample size 40 patient , divide two group 20 ( A placebo , B alpha lipoid acid ) . All patient undergo open carpal tunnel release surgery , procedure perform expert surgeon . A total four visit perform follow : T0 . baseline 4 week surgery , T1 immediately surgery , T2 : 4 week surgery , T3 : 8 week surgery , T4 : 12 week surgery . The assessment perform visit include : physical examination , Boston Questionary Carpal Tunnel Syndrome . Nerve conduction study ecographic evaluation perform visit T0 , T1 T4 . Statistical Analysis : Categorical variable assess count percent frequency compare use chi-squared test . All statistical analysis perform use SPSS 21.0 package ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) .
