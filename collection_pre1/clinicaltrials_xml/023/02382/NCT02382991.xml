	<brief_summary>Moderately active amputee may lose limb due diabetes , vascular condition , trauma , tumour congenital cause . These amputee currently benefit computerised knee performance criterion associate give one . However , amputee high risk fall use non microprocessor control knee joint ( NMPK ) physical ability , associate disability persistent contralateral leg weakness allow compensate balance deficit . These amputee restrict much move around participation instability elevate risk fall . The objective study evaluate effect 3C60 knee , microprocessor-controlled knee joint external leg prosthesis , reduction risk fall three month moderately active person leg amputation knee knee disarticulation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Disability Compensation With C-LEG COMPACT 2 Knee ( Ref . 3C60 et 3C60=ST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient evaluate one month use his/her usual non micropressor control knee joint ( NMPK ) . After fit 3C60 , patient undergo least five rehabilitation session , adapt his/her individual need , he/she know use device ready go along plan testing . After trial 3C60 knee , patient fit his/her non microprocessor control knee joint ( NMPK ) require undergo one rehabilitation session regain his/her walking ability .</detailed_description>
