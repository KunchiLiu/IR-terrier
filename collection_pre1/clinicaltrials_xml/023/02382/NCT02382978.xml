	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Nurse-Provided Well Child Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study deploy mixed-methods convergent parallel design19 , use quantitative method well qualitative data gathering analysis . To test acceptability satisfaction care receive , interview patient health care team member investigate attitude experience patient care provider . To explore effectiveness efficiency nurse-led WCC , interview chart audit ass quality care provide , cost term time team resource involve . These two method occur simultaneously result integrate report together give overall view feasibility nurse-provided WCC within Bruyere/Primrose FHT . Sample : There 2 cohort participant . The first cohort consist health care professional involve , namely family physician nurse Bruyere/Primrose FHT agree participate whose patient invite join research study . The second cohort participant consist parent well child ask nurse provide WCC pilot project . The eligibility criterion include : - Most responsible provider agree appropriateness inclusion - born term uncomplicated pregnancy birth - normal physical growth development date - parental post-partum depression - age 6 week 4 year age - due WCC visit study period Recruitment : The appointment schedule panel participate FHT physician review identify eligible child due schedule visit . The potential participant contact phone 1-4 week prior visit , research assistant , project explain invitation participate continue usual care . If parent agree , verbal informed consent phone obtain . Consenting patient offer nurse intervention arrival schedule appointment , option see family physician afterwards . They sign informed consent form prior visit , also ask interest participate follow-up interview . Intervention : A propose work-flow model nurse-led WCC develop , informed literature review competency-mapping exercise well discussion participate FHT physician nurse ensure feasibility buy-in . It likely nurse use Rourke Baby Record , standardize validated template well child visit , endorse use College Family Physicians Canada20 , use many physician Bruyere/Primrose clinic . FHT team member discipline ask review work-flow model consultation session provide feedback , buy-in , validation . The plan test selected cohort infant child adjustment make accord feedback previously unanticipated issue . The pilot project commence run 9-month period allow multiple visit patient , recall patient require specific WCC task possibly alternate visit nurse family physician . The goal perform 50 nurse WCC visit within study period . Data collection : To address secondary research question , semi-structured interview explore acceptability nurse-provided WCC parent , nurse physicians Bruyere/Primrose FHT , focus potential facilitator barrier introduction model care . Interviews hold provider cohort intervention phase , patient nurse WCC visit . Interviews stop theme saturation achieve 10 provider 20 patient interview , ever come first . The interview guide develop research team use information literature review , competency mapping-exercise consultation FHT member around recruitment work-flow planning ( see Appendix B potential interview question ) . To assess acceptability feasibility nurse lead WCC , investigator compile initial participation rate ( percentage patient contact accepted nurse WCC ) continuation rate ( percentage participant eligible additional visit agree another nurse-led WCC visit within study period ) . In order provide quantitative data acceptability nurse-provided WCC , electronic medical record participant Bruyere/Primrose FHT search quality indicator immunization rate , WCC visit attend eligible patient , use standard developmental questionnaire ( eg . Nippissing District Developmental Screen ) , completion template like Rourke Baby Record , proper documentation growth parameter , frequency visit study period , appropriate follow-up plan accord WCC visit finding . Further different indicator may select , base competency-mapping exercise currently underway . Using data extraction sheet develop participant ' chart audit , similar data extract randomly select age-matched cohort control subject offer intervention compare nine month intervention 9 month study period . Analyses : The transcript semi-structured interview anonymized read several member research team , include investigator . A cod template develop base literature review study objective may iteratively adapt initial interview allow emerge theme . Thematic analysis use code data , first create many code , group collapsed major theme sub-themes21 . At analysis meeting , entire research team review code , theme sub-themes reach consensus data answer question feasibility acceptability nurse-provided WCC . To ensure rigour , theme compare finding literature review chart audit , triangulate , final conclusion drawn22 , 23 , 24 . Quantitative data chart audit analyze use SPSS 21 descriptive statistic generate compare proportion receive recommend care across two group pre- post-intervention . Our hypothesis difference appropriate care manoeuvre receive control group intervention group . Patient characteristic summarize report group . Discrete variables summarize use frequency proportion . Comparisons discrete variable group make use Chi-square Fisher 's exact test , appropriate . As pilot project , investigator expect power detect significant difference care result use triangulate finding qualitative data appropriate care . Participation rate calculate base proportion invite patient participate intervention . Completion rate calculate determine proportion start nurse-provided WCC continue intervention visit full duration study . Results : The quantitative qualitative result integrate reported together provide description feasibility acceptability , well efficacy compare usual care nurse-provided WCC .</detailed_description>
