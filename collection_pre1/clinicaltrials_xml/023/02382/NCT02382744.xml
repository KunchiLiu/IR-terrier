	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing foot ankle surgery option nerve block administer Anesthesiologist . The nerve block numbs foot result less post-operative nausea vomiting , good pain control . Two different technique block saphenous nerve foot describe commonly used St. Paul 's hospital . The goal study compare success rate two technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose / Hypothesis This clinical study prospective , control , randomize , single-blinded trial design investigate hypothesis ultrasound-guided blockade saphenous nerve conjunction nerve stimulation high success rate compare ultrasound alone . These research intervention represent consider improvement standard practice St. Paul 's , block saphenous nerve one number saphenous nerve block , use number different technique ( i.e . ultrasound-guided , nerve stimulation , blind field block ) ; effectiveness inconsistent . The purpose study identify one technique great success rate another , would ultimately result increased success rate saphenous nerve block patient care . Study Design The study randomize , single-blinded trial 80 subject undergoing foot ankle surgery . Informed consent obtain study subject . Subjects randomize one two saphenous nerve block technique administer experienced regional anesthesiologist St. Paul 's Hospital . Once nerve block complete success evaluate investigator blind procedure . Once 30min evaluation complete anesthetic care provide accord regular institutional practice discretion attend anesthesiologist . The subject contact 2 7 day block administration ass delayed complication . Intravenous access gain non-invasive blood pressure measurement record every five minute . Continuous electrocardiography oxygen saturation monitoring maintain throughout procedure least 60 minute afterwards . Light sedation provide , goal maintain verbal contact subject throughout procedure . Where clinically appropriate , study block may precede ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic nerve block discretion attend anesthesiologist . Saphenous nerve blockade preform use transsartorial approach . Subjects group position prone . The ultrasound probe place transverse plane medial aspect thigh 3-5cm cephalad superior border patella ( area mark ) . An attempt make identify saphenous nerve , run deep sartorius muscle within subsartorial fascial plane . The nerve appear hyperechoic , round oval shape . The anesthesiologist maximum scan time 3 minute prior needle entry . Up 5 mL 1 % Lidocaine use skin infiltration injection site . The block preform protocol depend group allocation . A thirty minute evaluation saphenous nerve block occur normal monitoring period placement block . Following completion thirty-minute evaluation , anesthetic care provide accord regular institutional practice discretion attend anesthesiologist . This may include spinal general anesthesia . All subject contact telephone two seven day post procedure follow interview ass delay complication associated procedure . The medication use nerve block study include ropivacaine 0.5 % lidocaine 1 % . For subject sedation , midazolam fentanyl use . None medication consider study drug ; rather commonly use anesthetic medication . While use study , drug investigate . The medication use subject enrol study . Study Treatment Group 1 - Saphenous nerve block use ultrasound guidance The needle place needle tip close proximity ( 1-2 mm ) target structure ( saphenous nerve visible subsartorial facial plane sartorius muscle nerve visible ) . A total 10 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine use block . Before injection local anesthetic gentle aspiration preform , second aspiration 5 mL ropivacaine inject . Once injection local anesthetic commence small needle adjustment allow enhance spread . This do discretion regional anesthesiologist perform block . Study Treatment Group 2 - Saphenous nerve blockade use ultrasound guidance nerve stimulation The needle place needle tip close proximity ( 1-2 mm ) target structure ( saphenous nerve visible subsartorial fascial plane nerve visible ) . The Pajunk MultiStim SENSOR nerve stimulator turn , start 1.0 milliamp ( mA ) tap sensation elicit medial anterior aspect ankle . The amplitude nerve stimulator gradually decrease maintenance tap sensation make small adjustment needle location . The end-point nerve localization tap sensation area medial malleolus ≤ 0.6 mA . The anesthesiologist maximum search time 5 minute needle entry elicitation tap sensation . Once tap sensation elicit ≤ 0.6 mA range , 10 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine inject site . If tapping sensation elicit ≤ 0.6 mA within 5 minute 10 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine inject site low amplitude tap sensation elicit . If tapping sensation elicit subject 5 minute , injection 10 mL ropivacaine make Sartorius muscle subsartorial fascial plane . Before injection local anesthetic gentle aspiration preform , second aspiration 5 mL ropivacaine inject . Once injection local anesthetic commence small needle adjustment allow enhance spread . This do discretion regional anesthesiologist perform block .</detailed_description>
