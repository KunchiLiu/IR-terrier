	<brief_title>FAST Fish Phase IIb Clinical Trial Treatment Fish Allergy Subcutaneous Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fish allergy persistent food allergy ( usually lifelong ) life threaten due danger anaphylaxis ( severe allergic reaction ) upon accidental exposure fish . Until today curative treatment fish allergy . The treatment avoidance . Patients fish allergy avoid fish type carry adrenaline autoinjector rescue medication , case accidental exposure fish . That way patient fish allergy continuously control eat cause great deal stress impact quality life . The major allergen responsible fish allergy protein parvalbumin . It recognize vast majority ( 96-100 % ) fish allergic patient . During past , treatment food allergy immunotherapy successful dangerous , due serious side effect ( anaphylaxis ) . A novel biotechnological product , recombinant hypoallergenic parvalbumin , call mCyp c 1 , use first time phase IIb clinical trial , test efficacy subcutaneous immunotherapy treatment fish allergy . The investigational medicinal product mCyp c1 , base recombinant wild type carp parvalbumin ( rCyp c 1 ) result site direct mutagenesis , disruption two calcium bind site carp parvalbumin perform . The modified parvalbumin mCyp c 1 , hypoallergenic immunogenic . That way promise molecule safe effective treatment fish allergy . This molecule proven safe phase I/IIa study perform , mCyp c 1 administer subcutaneous injection . During study local reaction injection site observe . There observed systemic reaction . Even , clear indication mCyp c 1 recognize immune system . The result phase I/IIa study guarantee necessity phase IIb clinical trial mCyp c 1 , order study efficacy modify parvalbumin treatment fish allergy .</detailed_description>
