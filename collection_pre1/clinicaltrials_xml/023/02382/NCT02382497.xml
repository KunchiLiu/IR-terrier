	<brief_summary>The present study ground possible role hemispheric lateralization Eating disorder ( ED ) : specifically , hyperactivity right frontal region Anorexia Nervosa ( AN ) , hypoactivity right frontal region Binge Eating Disorder ( BED ) food crave behavior . Therefore , investigator hypothesize active excitatory tDCS leave prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) ( Anode left/cathode right ) may aid altering/resetting inter-hemispheric balance AN patient , re-establish control eat behavior . On contrary , active excitatory tDCS right PFC ( Anode right/cathode leave ) may aid altering/resetting inter-hemispheric balance BED patient people frequent food craving , decrease cravings/appetite binge eat behavior .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design randomize stratified , double blind , add-on , placebo-controlled . A group child adolescents AN select randomly assign two different condition : treatment `` usual '' plus experimental treatment ( active tDCS ) ; treatment `` usual '' plus placebo treatment ( sham tDCS ) . Similarly , group child adolescents Over-weight/Obesity ( OW/OB ) BED select assign randomized stratified sample follow condition : treatment `` usual '' plus experimental treatment ( active tDCS ) ; treatment `` usual '' plus placebo treatment ( sham tDCS ) . In project , investigator work understand whether brain-based treatment , use tDCS , improve outcome patient eat disorder . The investigator test whether tDCS treatment produce improvement under-eating over-eating disease , u AN OW/OB BED food craving . Our overarch goal provide scientific foundation devise new rehabilitation strategy ED .</detailed_description>
