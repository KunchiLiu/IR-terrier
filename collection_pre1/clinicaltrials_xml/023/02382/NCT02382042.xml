The next step process run ordinary least square ( OLS ) regression model give continuous nature main outcome variable , substance use . The investigator first run model examine main effect . Next , investigator test interaction effect determine whether effect PTSD substance use disorder varies type referral . Finally , ordinary least square regression model run determine whether 6-month abstinence rate low without family support compare family support . Innovation : To knowledge , first evidence-based substance abuse intervention modify rural veteran . If effective , SUD intervention first : - Specifically improve sobriety rate rural veteran , - Incorporate family member intervention , - Assess rural veteran satisfaction intensive referral , - Determine trauma symptom improve rural veteran adapt intensive referral , - Determine family involvement enhance responsiveness adapt intensive referral , - Significantly decrease relapse rate rural veteran , thus decrease re-hospitalizations subsequent health care cost .</detailed_description>
