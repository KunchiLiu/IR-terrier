	<brief_title>Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central Hypothesis : Non-invasive brain stimulation suppress alpha oscillation reduces cortical hyperactivity cause clinical improvement Aim 1 : To conduct pilot clinical trial establish feasibility collect first effectiveness data use tACS renormalize pathological alpha oscillation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dl-pfc ) unmedicated patient MDD compare MADRS score baseline one month follow . Aim 2 : Compare alpha oscillation power rest state EEG recording first last day stimulation . Collect EEG data one month follow visit use data analyze alpha frequency activity pilot study derivation EEG biomarkers .</detailed_description>
