	<brief_summary>Background : - Treatment Hepatitis C change lot past 2 year . Most change come combination medicine yield high cure rate . But long-term effect uncertain . One problem lot people need treatment , specialist give . The success rate Hepatitis C treatment primary care doctor , nurse practitioner , physician assistant largely unknown . Researchers want see provider type affect treatment outcome . They conduct large , community-based study District Columbia . Objectives : - To see people treat Hepatitis C safely successfully community-based health center . Eligibility : - Adults need treatment chronic Hepatitis C infection . Design : - Participants screen blood test . Their current medicine review . - Participants give researcher access medical record . Researchers follow participant record . - Participants see primary care infectious disease provider . The provider tell treatment . They tell often visit provider often blood draw . They get calendar study visit . - Participants take Harvoni 8 , 12 , 24 week . They visit care provider monthly . - Participants monthly follow-up visit 3 month finish medicine . - Participants yearly follow-up visit care provider 10 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Community-based Treatment Chronic Hepatitis C Monoinfection Coinfection With HIV District Columbia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment hepatitis C revolutionize last 2 year advent combination antiviral therapy yield high cure rate ; although , long term effect treatment remain uncertain . Use medication limit clinical trial setting typically highly specialize care team tertiary care hospital . As prevalence hepatitis C significant , exist significant imbalance patient require treatment specialist provide treatment . Success rate treatment hepatitis C primary care doctor physician extenders , nurse practitioner physician assistant , largely unknown . As , propose first community-based , large scale , longitudinal study directly act antiviral ( DAA ) -based treatment chronic hepatitis C , set District Columbia . Within study , approximately 600 HCV genotype 1 monoinfected HCV/HIV coinfected subject treat ledipasvir/sofosbuvir ( 90 mg/400 mg ) fix dosed combination 8-24 week , base medication label instruction , follow immediate ( SVR12 ) long term ( comorbid disease , cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma , transplantation mortality ) outcomes 10 year study period . The study conduct exclusively District Columbia clinic associate NIH DC Partnership AIDS/HIV Progress ( DC PFAP ) , serve population comprise primarily minority , high degree negative predictor treatment response . In study , participant assign treatment either ( 1 ) ID hepatology specialist , ( 2 ) primary care provider , ( 3 ) physician extender . Please see Figure 1 study schema approximate distribution subject . Each provider group undergo uniform training treatment hepatitis C management adverse event prior initiation study . All subject sign inform consent agree treatment follow phase study . During course study , subjcts clinically evaluate base American Association Study Liver Diseases ( AASLD ) / Infectious Diseases Society America ( IDSA ) guideline management hepatitis C. Clinical data subject capture city wide cohort database , store guideline-driven data point clinic visit within network . Through trial explore efficacy manage hepatitis C subject directly act antiviral therapy urban , community-based setting , investigate effect provider type ( specialist , primary care , physician extender ) treatment outcome . We detail safety tolerability treatment . We assess variability treatment outcomes monoinfected HIV-coinfected subject . Finally , evaluate public health impact large-scale treatment HCV infect subject prevent long-term clinical outcome . As first interferon ( IFN ) - ribavirin ( RBV ) -free , urban community-based treatment utilize new standard care criterion , study serve model implementation similar practice pattern globally .</detailed_description>
