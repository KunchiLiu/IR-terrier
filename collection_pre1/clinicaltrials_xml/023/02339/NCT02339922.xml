	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well ixazomib citrate rituximab work treat patient B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma grows slowly ( indolent ) . Ixazomib citrate may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , may block cancer growth different way target certain cell . Giving ixazomib citrate together rituximab may work well treat indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixazomib Citrate Rituximab Treating Patients With Indolent B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy ixazomib ( ixazomib citrate ) monotherapy untreated indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( B-NHL ) base overall response rate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy parameter include duration response ( DOR ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , time next therapy ( TNT ) , complete response rate ( CR ) ixazomib untreated indolent B-NHL . II . To evaluate safety tolerability ixazomib subject B-NHL . III . To evaluate safety tolerability ixazomib plus rituximab subject B-NHL . IV . To evaluate efficacy parameter include overall response rate ( ORR ) , DOR , TNT , PFS , CR combination rituximab ixazomib . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate clinical biological prognostic predictive biomarkers relative treatment outcome ixazomib indolent B-NHL . OUTLINE : Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally ( PO ) weekly every 4 week 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Upon completion 6 course ixazomib citrate therapy , patient also receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) weekly . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
