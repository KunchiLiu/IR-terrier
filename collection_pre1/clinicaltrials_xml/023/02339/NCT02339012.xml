	<brief_summary>Background : - Biomarkers substance people blood tissue . They help researcher understand disease sign age . Scientists want research biomarkers find way improve quality life old age . Objective : - To learn biomarkers relationship age . Eligibility : - Adults least 20 year old weigh least 110 pound body mass index 30 . They must agree genetic sample collect , study , store . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . They heart test nurse ass vein . They fill questionnaire . - Participants 2-day baseline visit . Then return every 2 year 10 year . These follow-up visit repeat baseline visit : - Repeat screening procedure . - Physical performance test like balance walking test . - Leg grip strength test . - Health mental state question . - Memory problem solve test . - Cytapheresis . Blood remove needle vein one arm run machine . The blood return needle vein arm . - Visits may also include : - Magnetic resonance imaging scan . Participants lie table slide machine take picture . - Diabetes test . After fast , participant drink sweet drink give blood . - Breathing walking test . - Wearing device record physical activity . - Scan abdomen right leg . - A small amount muscle tissue and/or skin remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Under assumption age cause dysfunction specific biological mechanism , reasonable hypothesize slow age delay onset chronic disease typically affect old person improve longevity quality life . Indeed , emerge evidence factor associate premature mortality also involved multiple pathologic condition typical age . Scientists suggest factor genetic nature involve variation genetic code sequence . Contrary view , genetic approach study age limited success argue study age longevity require comprehensive analysis include non-genetic biomarkers epigenetic , gene expression protein biomarkers . This non-genetic biomarkers reflect interaction genetic variation environmental/behavioral factor . A major limitation approach date study epigenetic , gene expression protein biomarkers rely blood specimen , may recapitulate biology tissue . In addition , although cell type person exactly genetic code ; information epigenetic modification , RNAm , protein expression likely differ across cell type different point time . Thus , global measure biomarkers specific cell type affect percentage cell type blood , well know percentage change age chronic disease . To overcome limitation describe , plan use cytapheresis collect large number PBMCs group healthy individual disperse wide age-range . The collection large number PBMCs essential obtain sufficient number cell cell type support measurement biomarkers interest . The information collect used identify biomarkers change age individual initially healthy , independent change specific PBMCs cell type . We also develop statistical model use study biomarkers adjust analysis PBMCs cell type composition without perform complex expensive measure , flow cytometry . The data collect PBMCs compare similar biomarker data obtain muscle skin biopsy understand extent biomarkers measure blood recapitulate similar change occur different human tissue . Finally , methodological limitation measure biomarkers blood address , plan assess relationship biomarkers assess specific circulate cell type , whole blood muscle skin biopsy physiological measure typically change age , include measure body composition ( anthropometrics , CT scan MRI ) , energetics ( spirometry rest different degree exercise intensity ) , homeostatic equilibrium ( hormones inflammatory marker ) , neurological function ( neurocognitive testing , brain MRI , nerve conduction study ) . The final goal develop new hypothesis biological nature age process age associate decline physical cognitive function .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Since study gene expression epigenetic regulation essential aim GESTALT , participant require consent DNA/RNA test storage Screening Visit subsequent Followup Visits . Participants refuse genetic testing storage eligible participate continue participate study . The criterion pertain Screening Baseline Visits , except otherwise note . If condition develop participant study , participant remain study . In particular , participant develop cognitive motor problem medical condition stroke Parkinson disease retain study , although exclude specific test underlying health condition exclusion criterion . Participants develop severe cognitive problem diagnose dementia , longer able participate study . Age great equal 20 year age . Are willing return every 2 year 10 year study visit procedure .

Do muscleskeletal condition due disease traumas ( cause pathological weakness and/or chronic pain ) . Do history severe psychiatric condition associate behavioral problem require chronic medical treatment . Do medical condition require absolute continuous need long term treatment antibiotic , corticosteroid , immunosuppressor , H2 blocker and/or proton pump inhibitor , pain medications.Do medical condition require use chronic anticoagulant medication use Coumadin , heparin antiplatelet agent low dose aspirin .
