	<brief_summary>Most woman plan cesarean section receive spinal anesthetic procedure . Typically , spinal opioids administer time component multimodal analgesia provide pain relief 16-24 hr period postoperatively . However , spinal opioids frequently associate adverse effect nausea , pruritus , sedation occasionally respiratory depression . The quadratus lumborum ( QL ) block regional analgesic technique block T5-L1 nerve branch evolve role postoperative analgesia lower abdominal surgery potential alternative spinal opioids . There evidence may provide visceral along somatic pain relief . It simple safe technique study low abdominal surgery , study pain relief cesarean section . If find effective , advantage reduction opioid associate adverse effect provide similar quality analgesia . This block evolve previously know transversus abdominis plane block . We propose undertake study compare relative efficacy QL block local anesthetic spinal morphine . We also study provide incremental benefit administer addition spinal morphine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize control double blind trial . Seventy five female patient belong American Society Anesthesiologists status 1-3 , age 18-45 yr undergo elective caesarean delivery include prospective study . After obtain informed consent , randomize one three group computer-generated randomization . All patient receive standard spinal anesthetic . They randomize one three group ( n=25 per group ) . Groups 1 3 receive intrathecal morphine addition spinal anesthestic . Group 2 receive equal volume saline add intrathecal mixture . Ultrasound guide Quadratus Lumborum block do . Following negative aspiration , 25 mL Ropivacaine 0.5 % ( Groups 2 3 ) , amount saline ( Group 1 ) inject side . All patient receive routine postoperative analgesia , include analgesic oral morphine . All patient assess postoperatively blind investigator 6 , 12 24h post-operatively .</detailed_description>
