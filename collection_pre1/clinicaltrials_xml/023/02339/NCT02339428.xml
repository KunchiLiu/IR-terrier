	<brief_title>Diclophenac Versus Placebo Pain Control Diagnostic Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim : To determine effectiveness oral diclophenac sodium quality colonoscopy pain control diagnostic colonoscopy hospitalize patient . Hypothesis : Null hypothesis : statistically significant difference diclophenac sodium placebo parameter quality colonoscopy pain control hospitalize patient undergo diagnostic colonoscopy . Outcomes : Primary outcome : Reduction total mean pain index 2 point ( measure 10-point Likert scale ) Secondary outcome : Reduction pain subgroup patient high pain index ( defined patient report 7-10 , inclusive , 10-point Likert scale ) Reduction pain subgroup patient moderate pain index ( defined patient report 3-6 , inclusive , 10-point Likert scale ) Proportion patient willing repeat procedure , necessary Need sedation analgesia colonoscopy Time discharge Adverse event : Total complication ( record begin colonoscopy hospital discharge ) Colonoscopy-related complication ( defined vasovagal , hypoxemic , bleed perforation event ) Total mortality ( defined lethal outcome begin colonoscopy hospital discharge ) Patients follow hospital discharge , average 10 day . Sample size calculation To able detect 2-point difference mean pain index standard deviation 3 , alpha=0.05 power=0.80 , investigator calculate required total sample size 72 patient . Methods This single-center , prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind clinical trial diclophenac sodium versus placebo colonoscopy . The investigator plan enroll total 72 patient refer diagnostic colonoscopy indication hospital stay . The trial conduct university hospital Croatia ( University hospital Rijeka , Department Gastroenterology ) . Inclusion criterion : inpatient refer colonoscopy indication hospital stay . Exclusion criterion : refusal sign inform consent age &lt; 18 year pregnancy lactation allergy nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug patient take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug previous seven day randomization ( except acetylsalicylic acid dose 300 mg/day ) patient antiplatelet anticoagulation therapy ( except acetylsalicylic acid dose 300 mg/day ) history gastric duodenal ulcer history GI bleed perforation history active inflammatory bowel disease severe liver disease ( defined presence history ascites and/or esophageal varix ) severe kidney disease ( defined glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 ml/min ) history myocardial infarction cerebrovascular disease history peripheral arterial disease congestive heart failure ( NYHA III-IV ) history systemic lupus erythematosus Protocol : Patients refer colonoscopy hospital stay inform trial protocol possible risk adverse event , offer accept include trial signing informed consent form . Upon inclusion , patient randomize computer random number sequence generation either 'Group 1 ' ( diclophenac ) 'Group 2 ' ( placebo ) . Patient allocation withhold participant trial store secure central location . Group 1 receive peroral diclophenac sodium dose 100mg ( two 50mg tablet ) , two hour colonoscopy , empty stomach one glass water . Diclophenac sodium tablet provide hospital pharmacy . Group 2 receive two tablet placebo shape , size , colour way different diclophenac tablet . Placebo provide collaborate pharmacy . The patient , attend physician , endoscopists , data assessor data analyst blind patient ' allocation . Allocation keep central location know person randomize patient . On day colonoscopy patient accompany trial form relevant data enter . First part fill attend physician refers patient colonoscopy , second part fill endoscopist third part fill trial associate day discharge ( appendix 1 ) . All patient assess randomization history physical examination , laboratory test include complete blood count , plasma glucose , urea , creatinine , glomerular filtration rate , Na , K , total direct bilirubin , aspartate transaminase , alanine transaminase , alkaline phosphatase , gamma-glutamyltransferase , albumin , serum protein electrophoresis , coagulogram ( prothrombin time INR ) , urinalysis , chest radiogram electrocardiogram . Statistical analysis The investigator use two-tailed Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test mean two-tailed Fisher 's exact test proportion . The investigator use Kaplan-Meier curve construction time discharge graphs Mann-Whitney U test statistical difference curve . The investigator perform multivariate analysis different characteristic test effect characteristic result mean pain index report patient . If characteristic show statistically significant effect , investigator perform univariate analysis covariates . Financial support This trial support Department Gastroenterology 's resource , consider drug investigate routinely administer patient indication .</detailed_description>
