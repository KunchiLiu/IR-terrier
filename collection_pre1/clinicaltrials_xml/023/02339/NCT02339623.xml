	<brief_title>Fetal Adrenal Gland Volume Estimation Prediction Preterm Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm birth ( PTB ) one lead cause neonatal morbidity mortality ( Goldenberg et al. , 2008 ) Early PTB ( ≤ 34 week ' gestation ) carry 7-fold increase risk Neonatal death . Following PTB , survivor experience significant long term cognitive , behavioral , emotional , sensory , motor deficit . Hence , grow interest identification woman Risk spontaneous PTB . Many biophysical biochemical marker discover identify woman risk spontaneous PTB . ( Honest et al. , 2009 ) Unfortunately , none various maternal fetal biomarkers : cytokine , CRH , C-reactive protein , fetal fibronectin , … . etc . sufficiently sensitive specific use alone combination help decrease rate preterm birth . ( Ozhan et al. , 2007 ) Obviously , 's need accurate method high sensitivity specificity prediction preterm labor . So appropriate management referral high center do woman likely PTB . Whereas unnecessary tocolytic therapy avoid woman unlikely PTB . ( Rengaraj et al. , 2009 ) Convincing data show 2-dimensional ( 2D ) ultrasound measurement cervical length ( CL ) identify woman risk PTB . Accordingly , CL widely use clinical practice risk estimation . ( Crane et al. , 1997 ) However , understand mechanism preterm labor ( PTL ) evolve , obstetrician learn , woman , cervical shortening phenomenon carry increase risk prematurity . Therefore , search early accurate marker distinguish physiologic process abnormal activation labor cascade ongoing . Literature suggest activation fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis play crucial rule commencement labor . ( Norwitz et al , 1999 ) A previous study demonstrate three -dimensional ultrasound measurement fetal adrenal gland volume ( AGV ) may identify woman risk impend PTB . ( Turan et al , 2007 ) In recent study receiver operator characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis reveal three -dimensional ultrasound measurement ( AGV ) superior two-dimensional ultrasound measurement ( AGV ) anticipation PTB within 7 day scan . ( Turan et al , 2012 ) The aim study investigate utility 3D fetal adrenal gland volume measurement early prediction PTB determine whether measurement could combine 2D ultrasound cervical assessment improve early prediction PTB .</detailed_description>
