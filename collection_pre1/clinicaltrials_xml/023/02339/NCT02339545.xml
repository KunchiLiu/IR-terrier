	<brief_summary>This acute , observational , prospective , multi-center clinical study evaluate Coronary Flow Reserve use Volcano FloWire® treatment Orbital Atherectomy stenting de-novo severely calcified lesion due Coronary Artery Disease . 15 subject enrol 3 active U.S. study site . Subjects undergo successful revascularization use Orbital Atherectomy stenting eligible enrollment . All enrolled subject treat OAS stenting see 24 hour discharge , whichever earlier . The purpose study evaluate coronary artery flow reserve follow successful treatment severely calcify coronary lesion OAS stenting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) affect 16 million subject United States , make common form heart disease . The American Heart Association 2010 Update Heart Disease Stroke Statistics report 2006 estimate 1,313,000 inpatient percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) procedures perform United Sates . Despite advance interventional equipment technique , still patient population remain challenging treat . One patient subset consist individual lesion calcium deposit . Up 50 % stent deploy calcified lesion find asymmetric stent expansion . Research also show increased amount calcium deposit lead high incidence major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) compare non-calcified lesions.In addition , lesion calcification show associated vessel dissection PCI , failure deliver stent , balloon rupture , un-dilatable lesion . Unlike PTCA stenting procedure calcify lesion crack stenotic lesion material crush arterial wall , atherectomy procedure remove stenotic lesion material , especially calcified portion lesion . Removing , oppose displacing , stenotic material may potentially lead reduce acute vascular trauma , lessen stimulus neointimal hyperplasia commonly associate in- stent restenosis , facilitate stent delivery expansion . Adequate plaque preparation modification may improve acute long term outcome subject complex lesion , especially heavily calcified lesion . Measurement coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) use Volcano FloWire ass physiological change distal vascular bed . The primary endpoint study evaluate coronary flow reserve successful treatment severely calcify coronary lesion use OAS stent deployment . The secondary endpoint measure occurrence post-procedural Major Adverse Cardiac Events ( MACE ) , include Cardiac death , acute myocardial infarction ( Q wave non-Q wave ) , target vessel revascularization .</detailed_description>
