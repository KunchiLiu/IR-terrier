	<brief_summary>Background : - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) create high-quality image human body without x-ray . It use strong magnetic field radio wave take picture . Researchers want test scanner use high magnetic field strength . Objective : - To study body responds high field 11.7T MRI scanner . Eligibility : - Healthy people age 22 65 . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They complete healthy volunteer questionnaire MRI safety screen form . They may 3T MRI scan brain . - Participants MRI scan . They lie table slide MRI cylinder slowly . They ask lie still . - Participants simple task inside machine . These include listen respond question , tap finger , move hand . - While scanner , participant hear loud knocking noise . They get earmuff . - Right exit scanner , participant get questionnaire fill . This ask felt inside scanner . - During MRI , participant heart rate , respiratory rate , skin temperature measure . Before scan , thing plus blood pressure measure . - Participants test MRI scanner . They answer question , take pen-and-paper computer test , simple action . Their sense smell may test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The goal pilot study establish normative database vital sign , cognitive function unusual subjective sensation 0T scanner . This data use reference future study effect exposure 11.7T static magnetic field . Study Population 26 healthy volunteer , age 22-65 . Accrual ceiling =50 Accrual Target =26 Drop out replaced Design The study consist one outpatient screen session one experimental session . Informed consent history neurological examination carry screening visit . Vital sign ( pulse oximeter , heart rate , respiratory rate skin temperature ) measure immediately experimental scan session , pulse oximeter , heart rate respiration monitor subject scanner . Subjects remain scanner approximately 1 hour . During experimental session , subject scanner , ask carry brief test attention 10-15 minute interval , 3 time session . At end experimental session , subject fill MRI exit questionnaire rate subjective sensation nausea , vertigo , lightheadedness , Likert scale complete computerized neuro-cognitive test battery . Outcome Measures The objective study obtain normative dataset neuropsychological test measure , physiological parameter , subjective experience measure subject undergo 0T exposure .</detailed_description>
