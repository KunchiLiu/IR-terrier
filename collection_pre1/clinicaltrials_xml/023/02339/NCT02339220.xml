	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine value Constraint-Induced Movement therapy ( CIMT ) improve motor function general fitness adult subacute chronic traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , particularly TBI acquire active military duty , comparison Lakeshore Enriched Fitness Training ( LEFT ) . The study also test effect set enhance versus `` standard '' procedure transfer therapeutic gain treatment set everyday life . Lastly , study determine whether therapeutic effect observe correlated neuroplastic white matter grey matter change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose project prospective , randomize , control , single-blind study compare motor improvement result Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy ( CIMT ) Lakeshore Enriched Fitness Training ( LEFT ) traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) veteran civilian . Over course two year , total 80 subject randomly assign 4 condition . Treatment , test , follow-up test carry first 3 grant year 1-year follow-up complete fourth year . Clinical test conduct pre-treatment , post-treatment , 1-year follow-up . Longitudinal neuroimaging study determine treatment change white matter , grey matter , functional brain connectivity carry across above-noted time point different diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) analysis variant , voxel-based morphometry ( VBM ) analysis structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , analysis rest state functional MRI ( fMRI ) , analysis fMRI hand movement . The 80 study participant randomly assign equal number 1 4 arm : CIMT Standard Transfer Package ( sTP ) , CIMT Enhanced Transfer Package ( eTP ) , LEFT sTP LEFT eTP . Forty volunteer test average per year . The patient classified mild/moderate ( Grade 2 ) moderate motor deficit ( Grades 3 ) ; classification make impairment level base standard active range motion ( AROM ) criterion ( elaborate `` Eligibility Criteria '' ) . The primary clinical outcome pre- post-treatment change measure use more-affected arm daily life know Motor Activity Log . It describe outcomes section . As noted , response brain intervention examine use structural grey matter MRI analysis , DTI , fMRI rest state arm movement . Each participant option accompany caregiver ( travel living expense pay project ) . The caregiver ask complete MAL independently participant . The questionnaire administer patient administer caregiver . In addition , caregiver show help patient carry home practice exercise treatment afterwards ( remain close contact participant ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Motor criterion make use impairmentlevel system characterize severity upperextremity ( UE ) motor deficit base Active Range Motion ( AROM ) . All UE motor criterion determination make subject sitting . The moreaffected forearm rest support surface ( e.g . arm chair ) allow maximum wrist flexion gravity . This study treat patient level Grade 2 ( mild/moderate impairment ) Grade 3 ( moderate impairment ) . The minimum motor criterion ( MMC ) inclusion Grade 3 ( moderate impairment ) ability : Extend gravity least 10 degree wrist fully flex start position Extend two finger least 10 degree metacarpophalangeal ( MP ) joint either proximal distal interphalangeal ( IP ) joint Extend abduct thumb least 10 degree Extend elbow least 20 degree 90 degree flex start position Flex abduct shoulder least 45 degree The MMC inclusion Grade 2 ( mild/moderate impairment ) ability : Extend gravity least 20 degree wrist fully flex start position Extend finger least 10 degree MP joint either proximal distal IP joint Extend abduct thumb least 10 degree Extend elbow least 20 degree 90 degree flex start position Flex abduct shoulder least 45 degree Additionally , subject must substantially reduce use extremity activity daily live indicate score less 2.5 Motor Activity Log ( MAL ) . Note : Each movement describe must repeat 3 time 1 minute . Those &lt; 3 month postTBI . Excessive UE spasticity . Insufficient stamen carry requirement therapy ( base clinical judgment ) . Medication ( include psychoactive substance ) exclusionary except follow case : ( If subject medication , medication record possible effect treatment outcome analyze separately ) Participation experimental drug field study Botox injection moreaffected UE le 3 month prior participation Baclofen Dantrium take orally time study MiniMental Status Exam ( MMSE ) score 20 . Concurrent participation formal physical rehabilitation program clinical trial . Excessive pain joint moreaffected extremity could limit ability cooperate intervention ( base clinical judgment ) . Serious , uncontrolled medical problem ( e.g. , cardiovascular , severe rheumatoid arthritis , serious joint deformity arthritic origin , symptomatic cancer renal disease , kind endstage pulmonary cardiovascular disease , uncontrolled epilepsy ) judge Medical Director . Other neurological musculoskeletal condition affect UE function . Unable read speak English . Inadequate communication skill , i.e. , able reliably understand question able express need report behavior , participate study base clinical judgment . Substantial use moreaffected arm daily life reflect Motor Activity Log score &gt; 2.5 . Pain interferes use moreaffected arm base clinical judgment . A positive pregnancy test exclude participant MRI scanning , would exclude clinical treatment .</criteria>
