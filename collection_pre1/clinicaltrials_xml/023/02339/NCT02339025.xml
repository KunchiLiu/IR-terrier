	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers National Cancer Institute Department Defense try learn cause cancer , heart disease , health problem . To , gather data risk factor biological marker . They get data large group people long-running study . As group people age , researcher must form new group . TRICARE health insurance program uniformed service member family . It major part Military Health System . Researchers hope form new study group TRICARE member . This study test TRICARE member take part research study .

	<detailed_description>DCEG long history develop run major cohort study , form backbone research portfolio Division . Existing cohort , include limited AARP , PLCO USRT , extremely productive generate wealth information potential cancer risk factor biological marker . In next decade , cohorts reach end natural lifetime due length time since baseline questionnaire , average age participant , depletion biological sample . There need , therefore , start plan next generation cohort able continue address current future hypotheses etiology cancer . A work group within DCEG form discuss potential setting , cohort study within US military setting select one promising possibility . Attractive feature conducive conduct cohort study use TriCare health insurance system possibility linkage numerous electronic database , include maintain address enrollment status , pharmacy database , medical record database , cancer registry mortality database . Tricare health care insurance program uniformed service member ( active , Guard/Reserve , retire ) family . Our overarching , long-term , objective build new prospective multi-center adult cohort among membership Tricare insurance plan . The cohort rich exposure information accurate outcome information use Divisionwide resource investigate novel hypotheses etiology cancer , use questionnaire data , medical record , tumor tissue serial biospecimens . Given large-scale nature anticipate cohort study , plan begin work conduct feasibility study military treatment facility , Walter Reed National Medical Center ( WRNMMC ) . The goal feasibility study help u determine possible large effort . Several feasibility study conduct group DCEG . Depending outcome study , DCEG senior leadership make decision whether one large cohort several small cohort move forward . The feasibility study two part : Part 1 ) randomly select invite participate , post , stratify sample 1,000 eligible beneficiary age 35-74 year old . All participant ask access study website , complete on-line consent form include consent access electronic health record , complete on-line questionnaire , provide blood specimen within three month enrol study . The letter offer paper-based option consent questionnaire completion unwilling unable access website . The following outcome evaluate : % enrollment , % questionnaire completion , % agreement blood draw , % completion blood draw , time enrollment blood draw , duration enrollment Tricare , % supplemental civilian insurance , feasibility link electronic patient database questionnaire data , available characteristic participant non-participants ; Part 2 ) Using MDR file , Defense Health Agency ( DHA ) provide frequency place cancer diagnosis treatment ( military treatment facility vs. civilian hospital ) availability treatment data eligible beneficiary diagnosis cancer nonmelanoma skin cancer within past 12 month . No individual level data collect . The protocol format submission WRNMMC .</detailed_description>
