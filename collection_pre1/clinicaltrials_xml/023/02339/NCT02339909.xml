	<brief_summary>This trial randomise control trial ass whether annual attendance rate diabetic eye screen appointment Kensington , Chelsea Westminster could improve offer invitee small financial incentive . The research question : 1 . Are incentives effective strategy encourage participation screen programme ? 2 . Does design financial incentive scheme affect effectiveness influence participation health screen ? 3 . Does choice incentive scheme , successful , attract patient different demographic socioeconomic status attend screen regularly ? 4 . Is offer incentive cost-effective strategy enhance participation ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incentives Diabetic Eye Assessment Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An increase emphasis place preventative healthcare NHS ( National Health Service ) . Screening programme currently exist many clinical area include diabetic retinopathy well breast cancer , cervical cancer cardiovascular disease . In many contexts benefit health screen well document , concern exist effectiveness cost-effectiveness programme uptake screening may poor , generally hard reach , community . There many way try encourage participation health promoting activity likely real shift behaviour come mix strategy . In study set see improve screen rate London , high low level deprivation specific population poor attendance . The ultimate success high-quality screen program depends uptake rate population novel solution require meet challenge achieve . Diabetes increase public health concern worldwide . There 2.9 million people diagnosed diabetes UK ( United Kingdom ) estimate 850,000 people condition recognise . Whilst rate vascular risk factor hypertension , smoke hypercholesterolaemia fall , rate diabetes UK rise . This despite co-ordinated effort primary secondary care prevention programme . All patient diabetes risk develop diabetic retinopathy . This condition cause microscopic damage small blood vessel eye . There proliferation ( growth ) vessels new fragile vessel may bleed destroy retina lead sight loss . It estimate England every year 4,200 people risk blindness cause diabetic retinopathy 1,280 new case blindness cause diabetic retinopathy . It lead cause sight loss UK work population therefore significant social financial burden associate condition . However timely diagnosis treatment risk blindness dramatically reduce . As condition may well remain silent catastrophic late manifestation disease evident , need effective screen programme obvious . The National Screening programme implement England 2003 2006 . This involve annual retinal digital photographic screening offer people age 12 year old diagnose type 1 type 2 diabetes . The test involve administration eye drop eye photograph retina take without contact eye . The success screen programme without contest . In 2011-2012 , 2,587,000 people England age 12 identify diabetes 90 % offer screening diabetic retinopathy . 1,911,000 receive screen equates uptake 81 % . However significant variability uptake differ area . Although screening offer multiple location include GP ( general practice ) surgeries hospital , poor uptake screen socially deprive area well document . For example , Gloucestershire , increase quintile deprivation , diabetes prevalence increase ( odds ratio 0.84 ) , probability screen diabetic retinopathy decrease ( odds ratio 1.11 ) , prevalence sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy among screened patient increase also ( odds ratio 0.98 ) . Since effectiveness screen programme intimately link uptake population ( particular uptake risk ) , simple , inexpensive cost effective strategy require NHS influence population health behaviour domains choice often sharp contrast underlying intention . This relevance diabetic retinopathy screening also widely increasingly try prevent disease rather simply treat . Incentives central economics use across public private sector influence behaviour . Psychological phenomena behavioural economics allow u design incentive-based intervention effective deliver improve outcome . Personal incentive use motivate patient general population change behaviour . Examples behaviours target include smoking drug use cessation . Incentives include cash , voucher benefits-in-kind profound effect individual behaviour relatively small cost . Interest offer incentive foster healthy lifestyle increase , full economic social cost bad choice unhealthy behaviour become apparent . Incentives previously use improve cancer screen rate , target provider service rather people invite attend screening . Financial incentives see effective increase performance infrequent behaviour ( e.g . vaccination ) rather sustain behaviour ( e.g . smoking ) . As screen usually require discrete one-off behaviour , incentive may particularly effective increase uptake . A wider use incentives public health intervention recent phenomenon attract controversy concern whether effective ( cost effective ) . This study provide evidence policy maker role different incentive scheme encourage health promoting behaviour . We suggest provide incentive answer encourage screen participation , demonstrate good evidence effective ( cost effective ) , target application may indicate . Equally demonstration incentive type effective may prevent unnecessary financial loss NHS wider rollout programme consider .</detailed_description>
