	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) preventable cause stroke . CHADS CHA2DS2VASc score predict likelihood stroke patient nonvalvular AF . Atrial flutter confers similar risk stroke atrial fibrillation . Anticoagulant therapy warfarin , dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban , edoxaban effective prevention thromboembolic stroke patient AF . However , despite widely available risk stratification tool , five option anticoagulation , evidence-based practice guideline , thromboprophylaxis stroke prevention AF under-prescribed U.S. , Europe , worldwide . The investigator previously demonstrate efficacy alert-based computerized decision support ( CDS ) strategy prevention symptomatic venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) at-risk hospitalized patient receive thromboprophylaxis . The investigator ' goal create evaluate alert-based CDS strategy stroke prevention patient nonvalvular AF atrial flutter randomize control trial . The investigator follow specific aim : Aim # 1 ( Primary Endpoint ) - To assess whether alert-based computerized decision support strategy increase prescription anticoagulant patient nonvalvular AF atrial flutter risk stroke systemic embolism . Hypothesis # 1- An alert-based computer decision support ( CDS ) strategy increase prescription anticoagulant patient nonvalvular AF atrial flutter risk stroke systemic embolism . Relevance- Failure prescribe anticoagulant therapy stroke prevention AF represent critical patient safety concern . The investigator successfully apply alert-based CDS another important unmet patient safety need : prescription thromboprophylaxis hospitalize patient increase risk VTE . During Year 1 study , Brigham Women 's Hospital design alert-based CDS program notify individual clinician private electronic message hospitalize patient risk stroke due AF atrial flutter . The message specify order anticoagulant therapy contain patient 's predict risk develop stroke absence anticoagulation . In Years 2 3 , investigator conduct randomize controlled trial evaluate impact alert-based CDS strategy prescription anticoagulant therapy at-risk patient nonvalvular AF atrial flutter . Aim # 2 ( Secondary Endpoint ) - To determine potential impact alert-based computerized decision support strategy frequency stroke systemic embolism at-risk patient nonvalvular AF atrial flutter . Hypothesis # 2- This study provide proof-of-concept data , include event rate , design large randomize control trial ass whether alert-based CDS strategy reduce frequency stroke systemic embolism at-risk patient nonvalvular AF atrial flutter . Relevance- Strokes patient AF prescribe anticoagulant therapy important source morbidity , mortality , health care cost . In randomized controlled trial , investigator previously demonstrate alert-based CDS reduce frequency symptomatic VTE high-risk hospitalize patient order thromboprophylaxis 41 % . The investigator conduct randomize controlled trial evaluate potential impact alert-based CDS strategy prevent stroke at-risk patient nonvalvular AF atrial flutter prescribe anticoagulant . The number stroke endpoint small show statistical difference . These data provide information useful ass feasibility calculate sample size estimate large pivotal trial clinical end point . Though investigator ' research conduct hospitalized patient AF atrial flutter , investigator ' methodology extend outpatient set future study .</detailed_description>
