	<detailed_description>The study take place single-center ; prospective randomize study preterm infant less 1500 gram and/or less 32 week gestational age , admit Neonatal Intensive Care Unit University Clinical Hospital Santiago de Compostela . They recruit period 14 month ( July 2010 august 2011 ) follow birth 2 year life . 40 child include follow study . Patients assign randomly two group depend type formula receiving . The group A child receive formula supplement DHA ARA relationship omega 6/omega 3 = 2 . And group B receive formula DHA ARA , ratio 1/1 . The classification group A B make simple random way ; one birth every group , continuously . Implementation breastfeed promote fortified 7 day life , total amount breast milk 1/2 total . When breastfeed insufficient nonexistent , special formulas premature baby give During follow-up patient , measure : 1 . - Levels fatty acid blood first week life , 3 month , 6 month 12 months.The determination carry collaboration Hospital de Cruces , Bilbao , Spain . 2 . - Evaluation psychomotor development Brunet-Lezine scale 2 year correct age .</detailed_description>
