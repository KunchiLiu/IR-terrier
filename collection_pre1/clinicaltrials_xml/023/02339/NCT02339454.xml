	<brief_summary>Low intensity shockwaves proven animal pilot clinical study induce local growth new blood vessel . Small single-center clinical trial shockwave therapy show promising result reduce angina symptom , improve perfusion contractility patient refractory angina stress-induced ischemia image test . The hypothesis study shockwave therapy could improve angina symptom exercise tolerance broad population patient stable angina regardless image test result Study aim demonstrate anti-anginal efficacy Extracorporeal Shockwave Myocardial Revascularization Therapy ( ESMR ) , top stable optimal medical treatment patient stable angina .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Extracorporeal Shockwave Myocardial Revascularization Therapy Patients With Stable Angina Pectoris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low intensity shockwaves ( 0.09 millijoule/mm2 ) deliver myocardial tissue . Shockwaves create special generator focus use shockwave applicator device . The treatment guide standard echocardiography equipment . The shockwaves deliver synchronization Patient R-wave ( ECG ) avoid arrhythmia . The treatment painless . At first , patient undergoes modify Bruce treadmill test , ass exercise induce ischemia . Exercise induce ECG ischemia define new development horizontal - slop ST segment depression ( ≥1 mm 60 m J point ) versus baseline tracing . Study treatment consist 9 session , 3 session per week 1 , 5 9 . 100 shock deliver per spot , 1200 shock per session . During 1st treatment week ESMR deliver 3 time ( every day ) basal segment ( 2 spot wall apical 4- , 2- , 3- chamber position ) . During 2nd treatment week ESMR deliver 3 time ( every day ) middle segment ( 2 spot wall apical 4- , 2- , 3- chamber position ) . During 3rd treatment week ESMR deliver 3 time ( every day ) apical segment ( 2 spot wall apical 4- , 2- , 3- chamber position ) . The spot localize ultra-sound device shockwaves focus area . Several treatment require optimal result .</detailed_description>
