	<brief_title>Non Invasive Prenatal Testing ( NIPT ) Single-gene Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Conventional prenatal diagnosis ( PND ) single-gene disorder require invasive procedure , either chorionic villus sample 11 14 week gestation amniocentesis 15 week . Although approach obtain foetal DNA currently provide golden standard PND , invasive procedure carry risk miscarriage 0.5-1 % . A reliable non-invasive alternative long sought . Circulating cell-free foetal ( cff ) nucleic acid ( DNA RNA ) , present maternal blood pregnancy , use non-invasive prenatal testing ( NIPT ) . NIPT chromosomal anomaly ( trisomy 21 , 13 , 18 ) validate . NIPT chromosomal anomaly still development . NIPT single-gene disorder technically challenge , due predominance maternal DNA sequence , Some small study show limited number monogenic genetic disorder currently diagnose maternal blood . In general de novo mutation foetus paternally transmit disorder less difficult diagnose maternally transmitted disorder . In study , investigator aim develop non-invasive targeted molecular analysis use cell free fetal ( cff ) DNA cff RNA single-gene disorder , pregnant woman refer department Clinical Genetics Maastricht University Medical Centre ( MUMC+ ) Radboud University Medical Centre ( RUMC ) conventional PND . The investigator contribute literature confirm early publish result , add single-gene disorder mutation list disorder possibility use cff DNA examine . Objective : Developing target non-invasive prenatal analysis single-gene disorder use cff DNA RNA maternal plasma . Study design : This study proof concept study aim demonstrate molecular analysis indicate presence absence ( ) mutant allele ( ) maternal plasma . Study population : Pregnant woman ( â‰¥18y ) refer Department Clinical Genetics MUMC+ RadboudUMC conventional PND , one follow reason : - The fetus high risk inherit dominant recessive disorder his/her affect parent ( ) . - The fetus risk de novo disorder basis ultrasonography finding . Main study endpoint : Does target molecular analysis cff DNA RNA indicate 1. presence absence ( ) mutant allele ( ) maternal plasma 2. presence sufficient concentration foetal nucleic acid maternal plasma reliably diagnose monogenic disorder Nature extent burden risk associate participation benefit : minimal burden : one moment blood sample pregnant woman partner . In case blood sampling combine regular blood sampling . Benefit : benefit pregnancy study phase result invasive prenatal test leading .</detailed_description>
