	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial study side effect best dose nivolumab ipilimumab give together without sargramostim see well work treat patient stage III-IV melanoma remove surgery . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab nivolumab , may kill tumor cell block blood flow tumor , stimulate white blood cell kill tumor cell , attack specific tumor cell stop grow kill . Colony-stimulating factor , sargramostim , may increase production white blood cell . It yet know whether nivolumab ipilimumab effective without sargramostim treat patient melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab Ipilimumab With Without Sargramostim Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival ( OS ) nivolumab/ipilimumab/sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) versus nivolumab/ipilimumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) patient treat nivolumab/ipilimumab/GM-CSF versus nivolumab/ipilimumab . II . To assess difference tolerability , specifically rate grade III high adverse event , nivolumab/ipilimumab/GM-CSF versus nivolumab/ipilimumab . III . To evaluate immune-related response rate ( base immune-related response criterion response rate ( base Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion ) compare . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 , ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 , sargramostim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive nivolumab sargramostim Induction therapy . Patients partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) , complete response ( CR ) 24 week may continue maintenance therapy 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive nivolumab ipilimumab Arm I . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive nivolumab Induction therapy . Patients PR , SD , CR 24 week may continue maintenance therapy 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
