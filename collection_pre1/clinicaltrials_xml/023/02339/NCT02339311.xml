	<brief_summary>One three people diagnose diabetes 2050 , proportion likely higher among Native Americans . Diabetes control currently suboptimal underserved population Zuni Indians despite plethora new therapy . Patient empowerment key determinant diabetes control , empowerment difficult achieve due resource limitation cultural , language health literacy barrier . The investigator conduct home-based chronic disease ( diabetes ) educational intervention use Community Health Representatives ( CHRs ) associate improvement Patient Activation Measures score ( primary outcome ) clinical indicator diabetes control ( secondary outcome ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The number American Indians Alaska Natives ( AI/ANs ) diabetes grow rapidly , especially among young people . At 16 % , AI/ANs high age-adjusted prevalence diabetes among U.S. racial ethnic group [ 1 ] . One population Zuni Pueblo home small , geographically isolated tribe locate rural portion New Mexico , USA . It home ~11,000 Zuni Indians 90 % Zunis live Pueblo . This socioeconomically disadvantage population face major public health challenge grow health disparity . Changing lifestyle lead decreased physical activity increase caloric intake high consumption fast food , soda pop alcohol . Therefore , Zuni experience interrelated epidemic obesity , diabetes , hypertension , kidney disease intermediate phenotype . As part Zuni Health Initiative ( ZHI ) , investigator survey participant regard barrier healthcare [ 2 ] , particular attention diabetes care . In ZHI investigator also collect stored clinical phenotype information anthropological measurement participant . Participants identify follow barrier : access care , language barrier , limited patient education , anxiety around diagnosis , fear chronic disease , reluctance participate self-care , resistance dietary change , reluctance engage regular exercise . The investigator previously document suboptimal glycemic control high burden kidney disease among Zuni [ 3 , 4 ] . The burden present barrier ultimately translate lack patient activation engagement healthcare , effectively hinder adoption healthy behavior . Focus group subsequently identify common solution overcome barrier , include home-based care , point care test , individualized exercise nutrition prescription , care provider knowledge Zuni language , community culture . The information gather focus group [ 5 ] use design implement Zuni culture specific educational intervention diabetes . The investigator devise innovative educational intervention base coordination four key element : ( ) deliver healthcare incorporate collaborative communication within healthcare team emphasize great autonomy care , adherence medical regimen , patient-centered goal setting , retain ability address need patient , family member , healthcare team , and/or healthcare system ; ( b ) provide innovative educational organizational approach , well behavior change strategy , enhance adherence ; ( c ) address health belief reduce adherence over- under-predicting maladaptive thought ( e.g. , catastrophizing , minimize , cognitive dissonance , invincibility , fatalism ) interfere weight control ; ( ) use technology address barrier achieve desire health outcome . Sixty participant type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) complete baseline evaluation include physical exam , Point Care ( POC ) testing , Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) survey . Participants underwent one hour group didactic session lead Community Health Representatives ( CHRs ) subsequently carry monthly home-based educational intervention encourage healthy lifestyle , include diet , exercise , alcohol cigarette avoidance follow 6 month , clinical phenotyping PAM survey repeat .</detailed_description>
