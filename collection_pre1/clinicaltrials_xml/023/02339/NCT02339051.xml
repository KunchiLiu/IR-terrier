	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis large public health disease , characterize low bone mass micro architectural deterioration bone tissue , result enhance bone fragility consequent increase fracture risk . Osteoporosis present bone mineral density ( BMD ) content ( BMC ) , measure dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) , 2.5 SDs mean value young adult . BMD measure DXA surrogate measure bone strength primary determinant fracture risk men woman . However , majority fragility fracture occur woman individual osteoporosis accord standard , indicate BMD one among several indicator bone health assessment fracture risk also rely bone property . Newer image method , quantitative computerize tomography ( QCT ) , complement information DXA-measurements due ability ass volumetric BMD bone geometry differentiate cortical trabecular bone compartment . Bones composite material make predominantly live cell , extracellular matrix , water lipid . This composite nature bone material enable absorb stress elastic deformation endure high load fracture . A new vivo measurement bone material strength use evaluate bone mechanical property thereby fracture risk . It well establish skeleton benefit , term increase density , regular physical activity . However , change BMD still main surrogate assess improvement exercise-induced bone health despite experimental finding well finding human show improvement mechanical bone property independent change BMD . These improvement mechanical bone property may due change bone shape matrix composition . It could argue decrease BMD one possible manifestation osteoporosis bone strength fragility multifactorial . The objective study investigate role mechanical load bone material strength bone microarchitecture middle-aged woman . The overall hypothesis mechanical loading regulator bone material strength microarchitecture middle-aged woman . This intervention study participant act control . The investigator intend include 40 postmenopausal healthy woman 50-60 year age study . Advertisements local paper hospital use come contact suitable study subject . The woman ask perform intervention program , include jump one leg every day 3-month period accord protocol gradually increase load/number jump . The woman choose one legs intervention-leg stick choose leg throughout study . The leg without intervention use control . Both bone material strength ( BMS ) bone microarchitecture measure intervention leg ( tibia ) . The operator measure BMS ( OsteoProbeÂ® ) bone microarchitecture ( high resolution pQCT ) blind concern participant 's choice leg intervention . In addition , subject ask register daily physical activity structure diary . The primary outcome measure change bone material strength ( BMS ) low leg ( tibia ) intervention compare leg ( tibia ) without intervention . Participants attend two clinic visit , baseline 3 month intervention period complete . The secondary outcome measure change total volumetric density , cortical volumetric density , cortical cross sectional area trabecular bone volume fraction lower leg ( tibia ) intervention compare leg ( tibia ) without intervention .</brief_summary>
