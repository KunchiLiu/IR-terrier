	<brief_summary>Community walk issue old adult chronic condition describe important participation community . Walking outside home universally accessible form physical activity multiple health benefit . Walking 150 minute per week help reduce risk cardiovascular disease , hypertension , stroke , diabetes , osteoporosis , depression , well fall . Practice walk across road , slope curb , talk , deal crowd traffic , safe feasible improve confidence , balance walking ability . Being physically active outdoors nature appear improve mental health active indoors . Despite health benefit , majority old Canadians walk outside regular basis . Barriers walk outside include fear , physical disability due chronic disease , appropriateness footwear walking aid , physical environment , uneven pavement , weather temperature . To date , best strategy get people walk outdoors regularly unknown . The investigator propose evaluate effectiveness dynamic 1-day workshop , old adult infrequently walk outdoors learn strategy facilitate outdoor walking , appropriate use footwear , ambulatory aid equipment , goal setting , practice skill related increase outdoor walking . The workshop compare workshop plus involvement walk group 3 month . Outcomes include outdoor walking activity , total physical activity , walk ability , participation , health-related quality life . Each participant three evaluation : intervention 3 6 month later . The investigator interview select participant 6 month ask opinion work n't work . Increasing outdoor walking expect improve health well-being , help people live independently community longer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Inability walk outdoors restrict full participation physical activity community live old adult reduce health-related quality life ( HRQL ) . Older adult report limit outdoor walk 8 % achieve Canadian recommendation old adult 150 minute moderate-to-vigorous ( MV ) intensity physical activity per week . Known barrier walk outside include fear , physical disability due chronic disease , appropriateness footwear walking aid , physical environment , weather temperature . Group practice walk outdoors location variable environmental challenge potential improve physical ability , confidence , outdoor overall physical activity social participation . The extent safe feasible implement intervention people vary degree physical ability , preference walk , neighbourhood walkability , measure outdoor walking activity , unclear . Objectives : The study purpose evaluate feasibility randomize control trial ( RCT ) protocol design evaluate effectiveness education skill workshop plus 3-month outdoor walk group ( GO-OUT program ) compare workshop alone improve outdoor walking activity . Specific objective characterize participant ; determine feasibility recruitment ; estimate withdrawal rate safety feasibility study protocol ; obtain preliminary effect size ; identify optimal measure outdoor walking activity base validity , reliability , effect size data completeness ; identify participant ' intervention facilitator ' perception challenge benefit intervention evaluation tool . Methods : Design Participants-A feasibility RCT embed qualitative component propose 18 participant . Ambulatory old adult live community report walk outdoors ≤20 minutes/week stratify level walk impairment ( gait speed &lt; 0.8 m/s v ≥0.8 m/s ) randomly assign receive GO-OUT program workshop alone . Group allocation conceal . A blinded evaluator evaluate participant baseline , 3 6 month . At 6 month , focus group participant GO-OUT workshop group intervention facilitator , participate semi-structured interview explore perceive benefit challenge adherence , intervention strategy outcome measure . Interventions-The workshop include activity station people learn appropriate footwear , walk aid equipment ( pedometer , Nordic pole ) , goal setting , physical activity recommendations/benefits practice walking-related task . The GO-OUT program include workshop plus outdoor walking group . The walk group supervise consist 9 participant ; meet twice week 1 hour walk increasingly challenge environment achieve individualize goal . Outcome Measures-Outdoor walking ( primary outcome ) measure 2 method : outdoor walk item Community Health Activities Model Program Seniors ( CHAMPS ) ( self-report ) accelerometer/Global Positioning System ( GPS ) . Overall physical activity ( secondary outcome ) measure CHAMPS ( self-report ) well accelerometry . Measures aerobic capacity , walk competency , mood , participation , HRQL also administer . Neighbourhood walkability assess Neighbourhood Environment Walkability Scale ( self-report ) . Analysis-This feasibility study ; therefore , hypothesis test . The analysis include describe participant characteristic , estimate recruitment , withdrawal adverse event rate , estimate preliminary effect size outcome measure , estimate test-retest reliability outdoor walk time derive CHAMPS construct validity data completeness outdoor walk time derive CHAMPS accelerometry/GPS . A qualitative descriptive approach use analyse interview data . Conclusion-Increasing outdoor walking expect help people improve physical activity , ability live independently community , health well-being . This study evaluate feasibility trial protocol aim improve outdoor walking . Findings use justify inform planning future definitive multi-site trial .</detailed_description>
