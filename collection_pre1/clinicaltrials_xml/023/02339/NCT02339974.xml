	<brief_summary>The goal study determine short term safety ( &lt; 30 day ) mid long term efficacy ( 6 month &gt; 1-year ) heterotopic implantation Edwards-Sapien XT valve inferior vena cava treatment severe tricuspid regurgitation patient inoperable high surgical risk tricuspid valve replacement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heterotopic Implantation Of Edwards-Sapien XT Transcatheter Valve Inferior VEna Cava Treatment Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation ( HOVER )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective single center non-blinded ( open label ) , non-randomized safety feasibility study enrol patient symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation extremely high risk standard tricuspid valve surgery . These patient undergo inferior vena cava ( IVC ) stenting Edwards-Sapien Transcatheter valve amelioration symptom . In patient favorable anatomic substrate , pre-stenting perform right atrial ( RA ) IVC junction provide stable scaffold transcatheter valve implant</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must least 22 year old . 2 . The patient must severe , symptomatic ( ACC/AHA Stage D symptom ) tricuspid regurgitation assess 2D echocardiogram , evidence right heart catheterization ventricular vwave transmission inferior vena cava , evidence peripheral central venous congestion . TR functional nature , without anatomical abnormality tricuspid valve leaflet . 3 . The patient must evaluate `` heart team '' physician include interventional cardiologist , cardiothoracic surgeon , heart failure specialist present review multidisciplinary conference . By consensus , heart team must agree ( verify case review process ) valve implantation likely benefit patient . 4 . The heart team agree medical factor preclude operation , base conclusion probability death serious , irreversible morbidity exceed probability meaningful improvement . Specifically probability death serious , irreversible morbidity ≥ 50 % . Also , factor may increase patient perceived surgical risk inclusion trial clearly delineate present . The surgeon ' consultation note shall specify medical anatomic factor lead conclusion . At least one cardiac surgeon assessor must interview examined patient . 5 . The study patient agree comply required postprocedure followup visit include annual visit 5 year analysis close date visit , conduct phone followup . 1 . Heart Team assessment operability ( heart team considers patient good surgical candidate ) . 2 . Evidence acute myocardial infarction ≤ 1 month ( 30 day ) intend treatment [ define : Q wave MI , nonQ wave MI total CK elevation CKMB ≥ twice normal presence MB elevation and/or troponin level elevation ( WHO definition ) ] . 3 . Untreated , severe , leave sided valvular heart disease include mitral regurgitation stenosis , aortic regurgitation stenosis . 4 . Mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥40mmHG PVR &gt; 4 wood unit assess right heart catheterization . 5 . Any therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure result permanent implant perform within 30 day index procedure . Implantation permanent pacemaker exclude . 6 . Patients plan concomitant surgical transcatheter ablation Atrial Fibrillation . 7 . Leukopenia ( WBC &lt; 3000 cell/mL ) , acute anemia ( Hgb &lt; 9 g/dL ) , Thrombocytopenia ( Plt &lt; 50,000 cell/mL ) . 8 . Hemodynamic respiratory instability require inotropic support , mechanical ventilation mechanical heart assistance within 30 day screen evaluation . 9 . Need emergency surgery reason . 10 . Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40 % . 11 . Echocardiographic evidence intracardiac mass , thrombus vegetation . 12 . Active upper GI bleeding within 3 month ( 90 day ) prior procedure . 13 . A known contraindication hypersensitivity anticoagulation regimen , inability anticoagulated study procedure . 14 . Recent CVA clinically confirm ( neurologist ) neuroimaging confirm stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within 6 month ( 180 day ) procedure . 15 . Estimated life expectancy &lt; 1 year 16 . Expectation patient improve despite treatment tricuspid regurgitation 17 . Currently participate another investigational cardiac device study . Note : Trials require extend followup product investigational , since become commercially available , consider investigational trial . 18 .Active bacterial endocarditis within 6 month ( 180 day ) procedure . 19 . Patients TR secondary trauma tricuspid valve , history tricuspid valve endocarditis carcinoid syndrome . 20 . Patients sign symptom SVC syndrome , hepatic cirrhosis felt due passive congestion TR . 21 : Subject unable personally provide legally effective informed consent</criteria>
