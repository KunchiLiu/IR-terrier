	<brief_summary>Epidural technique offer advantage able titrate level , density , duration blockade use catheter associate relative maternal hemodynamic stability . One disadvantage , however , include raise maternal temperature attribute labor epidural technique . This study ass decrease maternal ventilation follow induction labor analgesia cause raise temperature .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Maternal Fever During Labor Analgesia Has Any Relationship With Maternal Ventilation ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fever labor complicates one-third delivery . The etiology intrapartum fever diverse include maternal chorioamnionitis , infection . In addition , epidural analgesia use pain relief labor associate mild maternal temperature increase overt fever . Originally dismiss obstetric anesthesiologist clinical curiosity little consequence , epidural-associated hyperthermia may lead significant maternal well fetal neonatal adverse effect . Observational investigation perform 2 decade ago demonstrate gradual increase temperature labor parturients epidural analgesia see elect systemic opioid analgesia analgesia . The epidural group show average increase temperature approximately 1 degree centigrade 7 hour whereas temperature non-epidural group remain constant . No evidence clinical infection report woman . Many study confirm raise temperature epidural group compare epidural group labor delivery . Several mechanism postulate study reach conclusion . The mechanism suggest include imbalance heat production heat dissipation , effect opioid interleukin-2 , marker inflammation induced epidural analgesia , etc . Our study aim first mechanism . It may physiological process lead imbalance heat production heat dissipation . Labor hyper metabolic state increase heat production dissipate via increase ventilation associate labor pain epidural pain relief . It conceivable labor woman pain relief subsequent epidural analgesia , decrease ventilation may occur lead decreased heat dissipation .</detailed_description>
