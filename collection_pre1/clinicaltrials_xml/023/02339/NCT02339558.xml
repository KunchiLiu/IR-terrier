	<brief_title>Nivolumab Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Objective tumor response nivolumab patient previously treat recurrent and/or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) base Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria version 1.1 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Tumor response nivolumab base immune-related response criterion ( IRC ) . II . Duration response . III . Progression-free survival overall survival . IV . Safety tolerability . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate effect nivolumab tumor burden analyze clearance plasma Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) first 4-6 week treatment . II . To investigate association treatment outcome immunological marker : ) Intratumoral expression program cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) program cell death-ligand ( PD-L1 ) archive NPC tissue ( mandatory ) ; b ) Serum absolute lymphocyte count baseline post-treatment ( mandatory ) ; c ) Plasma cytokine level baseline serially first 8 week treatment ; ) Expression PD-1 cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8+ T cell tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) baseline ( optional ) . III . To investigate functional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) sequence early predictor response nivolumab ( optional Chinese University Hong Kong [ CUHK ] ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) approximately 60 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
