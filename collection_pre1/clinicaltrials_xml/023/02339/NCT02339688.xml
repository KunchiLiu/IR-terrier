	<brief_summary>Current study investigate quality ( psychometric property ) clinical utility several mobility measure , accord disability level . Therefore , several aspect inquire : - Was effect rehabilitation - Is measure able detect change time ? And thus change exceed measurement error clinically important ( responsiveness ) - Does measure assess claim measure ( validity ) - Is measure able differentiate performance patient , inclusively good bad performance ( floor ceiling effect ) - Does measure give similar result consistent test condition another test day ( reliability ) Worldwide , theoretical approach physical therapy rehabilitation Multiple Sclerosis often appear significantly different . Since present research protocol perform different center across European country ( US sit ) , multi-center study additionally apply mapping volume content rehabilitation , well differential impact diverse rehabilitation approach train volume mobility , several disability level . Some health-economic analysis perform examine approximate cost rehabilitation compare effect driver cost ( set , equipment , staff ) .</brief_summary>
