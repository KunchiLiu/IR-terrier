	<brief_summary>Thyroid eye disease autoimmune disorder affect approximately 50 % individual autoimmune thyroid disease result enlargement ocular muscle may lead congestion eyelid ocular surface , ocular movement restriction double vision , optic nerve compression loss vision . First line medical therapy oral intravenous corticosteroid ( CS ) , several study show result reduction soft tissue congestion , study suggest ocular restriction visual loss may still occur spite CS therapy.i External beam radiotherapy ( XRT ) second line therapy controversial , study suggest benefit prevent onset double vision optic nerve compression study suggest benefit . Most proponent XRT TED believe effective early disease evolution . XRT show safe therapy side-effects , although retinopathy change develop small percentage diabetic use avoided diabetic . Combined oral prednisone XRT show effective reduce soft tissue inflammation motility complication either monotherapy two different study . To date trial compare combine XRT iv CS iv CS alone early progressive TED identify potential benefit reduce severity motility disorder prevent onset dysthyroid optic neuropathy . That purpose study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose : To demonstrate combine Radiotherapy ( RT ) intravenous corticosteroid ( CS ) effective iv CS alone prevent severe motility disruption ( include strabismus primary diplopia ) new-onset dysthyroid optic neuropathy early progressive thyroid orbitopathy . 2 . Hypothesis : Combined RT iv CS effective iv CS alone prevent motility problem ( reduce field single binocular vision , reduce ductions , strabismus worsen diplopia ) prevent new-onset dysthyroid optic neuropathy patient early progressive thyroid orbitopathy . 3 . Justification : Standard therapy progressive TED iv CS , occasionally supplement RT complication develop spite appropriate iv CS therapy . A single retrospective study suggest early combine treatment may prevent serious visual complication ; would first randomize controlled prospective trial see find true . 4 . Objectives : Demonstrate statistically significant reduce rate new onset optic neuropathy double vision patient progressive TED combine therapy versus traditional monotherapy . 5 . Research Method : Multicentre , institutional base , randomize control trial . 6 . Statistical Analysis : Subjects : 100 patient early progressive TED randomize equally two group : 1 . Therapy : iv MP 500 mg iv weekly 6 week , 250 mg iv weekly 6 week + XRT 100 Rads orbit x 10 dos 2 . Control : Same iv MP dose + XRT</detailed_description>
