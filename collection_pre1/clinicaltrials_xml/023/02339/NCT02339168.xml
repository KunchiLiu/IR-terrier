	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose metformin hydrochloride give together enzalutamide treat patient prostate cancer respond previous treatment hormone . Hormone therapy use enzalutamide may fight prostate cancer lower amount androgen body make block use androgens tumor cell . Metformin hydrochloride , use diabetes , may also help kill tumor cell . Giving enzalutamide together metformin hydrochloride may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enzalutamide Metformin Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) enzalutamide give combination metformin ( metformin hydrochloride ) patient castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) , few 33 % patient experience dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ) attributable study regimen recommend phase II dose combination . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response patient CRPC give enzalutamide combination metformin . II . To determine PSA progression patient CRPC give enzalutamide combination metformin . III . To investigate feasibility safety enzalutamide give combination metformin hydrochloride patient CRPC . IV . To obtain preliminary evidence efficacy combination . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect compute tomography ( CT ) -guided biopsy metastatic soft tissue bone tumor tissue analysis androgen receptor ( AR ) gene signature integrate biomarker ( University California San Francisco [ UCSF ] conduct analysis ) . II . To collect serum sample measurement PSA level bone re-absorption marker . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study metformin hydrochloride . Patients receive enzalutamide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) metformin hydrochloride PO twice daily ( BID ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 , 8 , 12 week .</detailed_description>
