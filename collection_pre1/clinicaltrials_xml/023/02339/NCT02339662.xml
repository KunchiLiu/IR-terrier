	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare two drug efficacy treatment pain originate masticatory muscle . The two drug - Amitriptlyne ( amitriptyline ) Gabapentin ( gabapentin ) , common use treatment chronic pain Methods - patient diagnose suffer myofacial pain , receive one medication ( Gabapentin amitriptyline ) one month , invite pain clinic control . Two week , patient start take drug 1 month invite department recall continue standard treatment . The patient choose whether continue medication one drug stop medication treatment . Total duration experiment two half month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective , Cross Over Gabapentin v Amitriptyline Study Patients Suffering From Masticatory Muscle Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Temporomandibular disorder one main reason pain damage function head , jaw neck ( 1,2 ) term somewhat misleading include two type pain , one originate temporomandibular joint , another originate mainly muscle mastication - Myofacial pain ( MFP ) . The last one seek explore etiology pain explain use biological-psychological model , reflect complex interaction physical factor , behavioral , social emotional influence ( 3 ) . The pain may last week many month ; usually severe one side face , especially pre-auricular area ( front ear ) . Intensity pain usually moderate ; squeezing , dull nature . It worsen mouth open often cause opening restriction ( 5 , 4 ) . One find trigger point pain harsh radiates remote area . Treatment often integrate , multi-systemic comprehensive ( 7 , 6 ) : physical therapy , behavioral therapy , night splint , Trigger point injection , use drug different family use manage treat MVP . Among drug use routinely : Amitriptyline nortriptyline family tricyclic antidepressant ( TAC 's ) . These drug originally intend treat depression day primary use treat chronic pain muscle origin , use low dos 10-35 mg /d , connection anti-depressive effect ( 8,9,10,11 ) . . Gabapentin gaba-amino buyic acid ( GABA ) analogue originally develop anti-epileptic ( 12 ) . This drug also use first treatment neuropathic pain ( 13 ) . A study publish 2007 Kimos et al ( 14 ) suggest use gabapentin high dos 4200 mg per day therapeutic option myofacial pain . The author prospectively examine use gabapentin versus placebo myofacial pain 12 week 50 patient , 36 complete study , result demonstrate improvement parameter . Another study conduct department accept publication journal orafacail pain &amp; headache examine retrospectively gabapentin Vs amitriptyline better result gabapentin complex widely spread disorder . To gabapentin side effect drug interaction profile good amitriptyline ( 16 ) . Moreover , gabapentin anticholinergic usually limit use amitriptyline . Therefore , gabapentin may attractive alternative treatment MFP . Our clinic use gabapentin routinely second option lack response amitriptyline . The aim study compare prospectively efficacy amitriptyline low dos 20 mg gabapentin low dos 900mg . Patients age 18 come orofacial pain clinic department Oral medicine , diagnose suffer facial pain originate chew muscle ( MVP ) least three month , invite participate study . The examination one use routinely include : patient demographic : age , sex , marital status , occupation , medical history . Pain characteristic include : Location , duration , intensity ( subjective ) , nature pain , whether pain prolong , frequency duration attack , disruption sleep , quality life everyday functioning ( work , company ) , whether pain accompany autonomic systemic sign whether patient suffers pain body outside region head neck . Patient receive questionnaire examine accompany emotional distress ( AXIS II ) . Masticatory muscle involvement examine palpation , load testing , restriction non-limitation mouth opening . All routinely use department . Patients receive explanation nature disease possible treatment . Patients would like participate study , sign consent form , receive pain questionnaire start medication treatment acceptable case myofacial pain . The drug use : amitriptyline 20 mg Gabapentin 900 mg . Patients side effect call receive instruction . After one month , patient invite clinic . A clinical examination , similar one mention perform re-filling questionnaire . First medication treatment discontinue two week replace equivalent drug . Meaning patient begin amitriptyline continue gabapentin ( two week break ) vice versa ( cross design ) . After another month patient invite clinic similar clinical examination questionnaire fulfil , , necessary patient continue preferred treatment . . All patient give consent participate study . Criteria improvement include : 1 . Intensity pain accord VAS scale . 2 . The frequency attack . 3 . The frequency use drug ( treatment chronic acute pain ) . 4 . Improving function - open mouth , free jaw movement . 5 . Quality Health Index ( AXIS II ) .</detailed_description>
