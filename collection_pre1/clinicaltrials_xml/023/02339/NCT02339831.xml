	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine well active motion device , Camoped , work compare continuous passive motion device , CPM , rehabilitation partial total knee replacement . It hypothesize Camoped active motion device provide outcomes equal superior CPM . Patients undergo either partial total knee replacement give opportunity participate . If elect participate , preoperative data collect include demographic , measure strength , balance knee bending , well survey regard current physical mental health , well knee function . After surgery , patient randomly select receive either Camoped CPM use rehabilitation . After discharge , participant ask maintain daily diary tracking use assigned device , well daily pain level . At visit 4 week surgery , participant ask complete series survey pertain health knee function , well perform test strength , balance knee bending . These result use determine one device produce superior rehabilitation result follow total partial knee replacement surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine well active motion device , Camoped , work compare continuous passive motion device , CPM , rehabilitation partial total knee replacement . It hypothesize Camoped active motion device provide outcomes equal superior CPM . 110 patient randomized course study . Participation last approximately 4 week . Data patient begin trial , choose drop lose follow include analysis . Patients elect undergo surgery one PIs , either total knee replacement Dr. Richard Scott partial knee replacement Dr. Wolfgang Fitz , inform study offer participation meet eligibility criterion . The PI obtain write consent office choose participate . For participant , demographic data include height , weight , BMI , age sex collect . Additionally , sit-to-stand , knee flexion , proprioception , strength balance testing performed office physical therapist . Participant response SF-36 physical mental health survey , knee function score , KSS WOMAC questionnaires also collect . Patients randomize receive either Camoped CPM device surgery . Patients receive device protocol usage hospital follow surgery . They use device duration hospital stay , take device home . At home , patient ask keep daily diary tracking device usage well daily pain medication intake . These result compare part study analysis . When patient return follow-up appointment four week surgery , demographic data include height , weight , BMI , age sex collect . Additionally , sit-to-stand , knee flexion , proprioception , strength balance testing performed office . Participant response SF-36 physical mental health survey , knee function score , KSS WOMAC questionnaires also collect . These measure compare preoperative result . Two-sample t-tests use analyze similarity two treatment group intervention ass difference afterwards . The Wilcoxon-Mann Whitney test perform non-parametric alternative t-testing data set find non-normal . Data collection management responsibility PIs . All adverse event report necessary .</detailed_description>
