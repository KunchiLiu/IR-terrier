	<brief_summary>Our aim determine feasibility use continuous glucose monitor ( CGMs ) infant low blood glucose improve care infant . To plan monitor blood glucose level CGMs ( instead intermittent bloodsampling ) late-preterm term infant admit NICU hypoglycemia . To see use CGMs help u prevent low blood glucose level allow u find diagnosis treat sooner , randomize patient one two group : `` CGM group '' CGM information make available NICU team `` Standard Care '' group CGM information available research team . However , infant `` Standard Care '' group note three unrecognized severe low blood glucose level research team inform NICU team occur .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Continuous Glucose Monitoring Neonates With Hypoglycemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We aim evaluate utility continuous glucose monitor ( CGMs ) improve diagnosis management neonatal hypoglycemia infant admit neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . Specifically , hope ass whether use CGMs population reduces number severity hypoglycemic event , reduces time diagnosis etiology hypoglycemia and/or reduces time take achieve stable euglycemia sustainable feed regimen . We plan perform prospective pilot feasibility study compare clinical course outcome newborns hypoglycemia admit NICU actively monitor CGMs versus receive routine care . Eligible infant late preterm term infant admit Boston Children 's Hospital two document hypoglycemic episode current admission . Families approach consent shortly diagnosis recurrent hypoglycemia . As infant undergo periodic blood glucose monitor part routine care , enrollment study involve minimal additional intervention , include CGM placement , involve placement small subcutaneous needle sensor , possibility draw additional blood glucose sample hypoglycemia detect CGM . All enrol infant place CGM monitor randomize either `` CGM Protocol '' `` Standard Care '' group . Those CGM Protocol fully accessible CGM analyze blood glucose trend alarm blood glucose level approach hypoglycemic threshold ( eg . BG &lt; 70 mg/dL ) . Those `` Standard Care '' group CGM place , value available clinical team except severe hypoglycemia record ( eg . BG &lt; 40 mg/dL ) . Whenever CGM alarm concern blood glucose trend measure CGM , nurse ask check blood glucose value . All clinical management decision make clinical team base confirm blood glucose value . In control group , change current management potential performance additional blood glucose check may prompt CGM alarm severe hypoglycemia . The CGM remain place infant longer monitored glycemic stability infant discharge . We record blood glucose level , laboratory data relate investigation underlie cause hypoglycemia , intravenous enteral source glucose , use therapeutic intervention diazoxide carnitine replacement . We also compare blood glucose data information CGM monitor assess accuracy . We compare severity frequency hypoglycemia , well time diagnosis euglycemia `` CGM '' `` Standard Care '' group .</detailed_description>
