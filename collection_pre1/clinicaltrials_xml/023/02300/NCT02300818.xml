	<brief_summary>Glaucoma among lead cause blindness western world . Elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) identify important risk factor . However , patient progress despite adequate IOP lower subject elevate IOP never develop glaucoma . Other patient develop glaucoma although IOP measurement always normal range . Therefore , factor must involve . In last year , study use MRI perform evidence accumulate also change retrobulbar structure present , particular lateral geniculate nucleus visual cortex . However , study limit low spatial resolution MRI instrument use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Magnetic Therapy Seawater Combined Decreasing Intraocular Presion .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The two principal pathophysiological mechanism glaucomatous process ( hydromechanical metabolic ) determine development two trend treatment glaucoma . One treatment modality aim reduction intraocular pressure , therapy hemodynamic metabolic disorder . General local drug therapy physiotherapy , include electro- laser stimulation retina optic nerve magneto-therapy , use correct disorder . Modern ocular hypotensive agent myotic beta-adrenoblockers , adrenergic drug , alpha 2-agonists , carboanhydrase inhibitor , prostaglandin , osmotic agent . The progress attain conservative therapy glaucoma mean overstate . In many case combination conservative surgical method treatment help preserve vision glaucoma patient . During follow investigation demonstrate use Magneto therapy Ocular ( MTO ) reverse symptomatology Glaucoma patient . The use Eyeglass magnetic prevents development Glaucoma disease.During follow investigation demonstrate use MTO reverse symptomatology Glaucoma patient ; use seawater drop prevents development Glaucoma disease combine use MTO seawater effective therapy Glaucoma disease cure grand percentage patient . We randomize 100 glaucoma patient treat MTO ( group 1 ) seawater drop ( group 2 ) combine group 3 compare result</detailed_description>
