	<detailed_description>Imaging biomarkers important tool detection characterization cancer well monitor response therapy . `` Whole-body '' molecular imaging , particular use 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET , proven useful evaluation management lymphoma patient . FDG-PET evolve valuable biomarker aggressive lymphoma , current state-of-the-art imaging technique response assessment end treatment . Additionally , prognostic value `` interim '' ( treatment ) early PET well establish Hodgkin lymphoma diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , together account 50 % lymphoma . Worldwide clinical trial ongoing evaluate risk-adapted individualized treatment strategy base interim PET result . Therefore , uniform evidence-based guideline interpretation warrant . International Workshop Interim PET Lymphoma recently propose 5-point score method far result validation study promise . However , one could speculate risk false-positive study due non-specific inflammatory effect great patient receive toxic regimen usefulness image biomarkers would vary different lymphoma subtypes . Meanwhile , thanks rapid technical development , whole-body functional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) particular diffusion-weighted MRI ( DWI ) reflect cell density feasible clinical setting . Quantitative parameter derive DWI reflect cell density may provide complementary information current state-of-the-art FDG-PET imaging reflect quantitatively glucose metabolism prove helpful patient management . Pilot study show potential whole-body DWI lymphomas stag response assessment 1.5 Tesla MR system larger-scaled prospective study require new imaging-based biomarker ever validate routine clinical use . Besides , technical challenge remain especially encounter higher-field clinical MR system . Finally , vast amount information generate whole-body parametric imaging data require development automate image analysis software , may help establish multi-parametric approach characterize residual lymphoma mass . Therefore , present study aim optimize whole-body DWI protocol 3 Tesla MR and/or new system combine 3Tesla MR PET , develop validate automate whole-body parametric image analysis algorithm , determine add value whole-body DWI FDG-PET management lymphoma patient .</detailed_description>
