	<brief_summary>The platelet-rich fibrin ( PRF ) , belong new generation plasma concentrate biomechanical processing simplify without need handle blood biochemistry . Some study show potential PRF release growth factor assist accelerate regeneration soft tissue , however contradictory result regard hard tissue . The aim study evaluate clinical analyzes , histomorphometric micro-computed tomographic image , dimensional change , quantity quality tissue form socket extraction receive membrane PRF . 15 socket ( test group ) receive membrane PRF extraction 15 ( control group ) receive biomaterial ( spontaneous healing ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical , Histological Micro-computed Tomographic Evaluation Neoformed Tissue Post-extraction Sockets Covered With Platelet-rich Fibrin ( PRF ) Membrane : Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Development methodology This study randomize control conduct accord principle outline Declaration Helsinki regard experiment human being . This work submit Ethics Committee , approval number : CAAE : 21317113.4.0000.5243 . To ensure quality randomize study , guideline RCT-CONSORT checklist follow . 2 . Selection volunteer / sample The sample consist 30 human alveolar socket . Selected volunteer must agree participate study sign informed consent form willing follow guideline propose timeline . The volunteer treat Dental Clinical Research Center Fluminense Federal University . The 30 teeth involve study provide indication tooth extraction without treatment possibility , determine clinical radiological examination . 3 . Pre-Surgical Treatment Dental medical case history conduct volunteer . Initially , volunteer select diagnosed clinical examination periapical radiographic cone beam tomographic ass need tooth extraction . All volunteer undergo basic periodontal therapy oral hygiene instruction . Volunteers risk factor bacterial endocarditis medicate Amoxicillin 2g single dose one hour procedure , allergic penicillin , prescribe 600g single dose clindamycin one hour procedure , recommend American College Cardiology . Laboratory test , include blood pressure measurement , complete blood count , lipid profile , coagulation profile complete fast glucose require volunteer . 4 . Surgical Procedures Plaster study model make mold alginate volunteer , enable construction measure guide ( template ) acrylic . Also intraoral photograph hold . Volunteers undergo local anesthesia ( 2 % epinephrine Mepvacaína - 1 : 100.00 ) extraction teeth . In case , extraction perform minimally traumatic manner without lift flap aim preservation tissue . Incisions intra-sulculares free surface ( buccal / lingual ) proximal ( mesial / distal ) perform scalpel blade 15C aim disruption periodontal fiber . The dislocation tooth conduct forceps , subsequent removal tooth socket . After extraction , rigorous inspection curettage socket removal granulation tissue hold , follow irrigation sterile saline . Performed extraction , start make venous blood volunteer qualify professional goal achieve PRF membrane . For , collect sterile without anti-coagulant 10 ml blood median cubital vein ( arm ) syringe . It lead immediately test tube centrifuge calibrate 2700 rpm 12 minute . After processing , three phase arrange within test tube . The fibrin clot obtain layer acellular layer plasma red blood cell . The tube carefully collect manipulated form membrane suture 5.0 absorbable synthetic yarn ( Vycril - Johnson &amp; Johnson ) . The suture remove seven day procedure . The remain fifteen socket ( control group ) fill biomaterial ( clot ) . Volunteers instruct rinse mouth twice daily 15 day chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12 % . Queries review conduct first week suture removal subsequent second fifth week . 5 . Clinical Evaluation Prior extraction group , band keratinize gingiva buccal lingual measure muco-gingival line gingival margin , support UNC-15 periodontal probe , position template ( stent ) acrylic resin . Furthermore , measurement gingival margin template , track keratinize gingiva measurement edge template edge bony ridge hold region mesial , buccal distal buccal lingual surface . For evaluation thickness tissue , surgical caliper locate 5mm gingival margin use . The data collect immediately record assistant . Clinical evaluation perform prior extraction ( T1 ) 120 day ( T2 ) . 6 . Histomorphometric analysis At T2 , implant instal socket region . The surgical bone obtain discharge procedure implant placement trephine measure 3mm diameter , collect . It store buffered formaldehyde , decalcify EDTA , dehydrate ethanol embed paraffin . Serial section include central portion bone cylinder prepare parallel long axis , standard microtome 5mm . The section stain hematoxylin eosin . The analysis new tissue form evaluate Leitz microscope equip image capture system . Morphometric measurement evaluate determine proportion occupy mineralize bone ( lamellar bone , immature bone ) , osteoid tissue ( connective tissue matrix rich collagen partially mineralize ) , bone marrow ( adipocytes vascular structure ) , fibrous tissue tissue residual ( tissue element unidentified artifact preparation ) . 7 . Micro-computed tomographics Representative non-decalcified sample scan resolution 18 x 18 x 18 voxels μc3 use micro-Pxs5-928EA cone beam CT . The GEHC MicroView Plus ® Analysis software ( GE Healthcare ) , use create three-dimensional reconstruction ( 3D ) bone tissue scan . The tissue analyze represent fragment tissue biopsy sample . The value scale grayscale use biopsy single calibrate examiner anonymous . The value average grayscale calculate used representative evaluate bone volume ( BV ) mineral content tissue value . The tissue mineral density also calculate . 8 . Statistical analysis The result express mean ± 95 % CI . Mann-Whitney test conduct . Will consider significant difference P &lt; 0.05 . Nominal data evaluate chi-square test . Alternatively , case associate ( extreme ) value , Fisher exact test use . Continuous variable express mean standard deviation analyze normal distribution use Shapiro-Wilk test . The Student Mann-Whitney test apply normal non-normal distribution , respectively .</detailed_description>
