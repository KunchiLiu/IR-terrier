	<brief_summary>Chronic pain laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) common complication incidence range 3-56 % . In many case , however , cause chronic pain LC remain unknown visceral hyperalgesia central sensitization suggest part pathophysiology . So purpose study determine whether Calot 's Triangle Block ( CTB ) combine patient control intravenous analgesia ( PCIA ) superior PCIA reduce incidence chronic pain LC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Calot 's Triangle Block Postoperative Analgesia Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy : Prospective , Randomized , Double-blind , Controlled , Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) currently regard gold standard treatment symptomatic gallstone disease . Compared open cholecystectomy , LC benefit include less postoperative pain , reduce analgesic consumption , early discharge . However , besides advantage mention , exist complexity diversity acute pain LC , consist somatic , visceral refer pain component . Meanwhile , team also find many LC patient experience visceral pain surgery . According epidemic research show chronic pain LC common complication incidence range 3-56 % . Several report indicate early postoperative pain show significant risk factor chronic pain . In many case , however , cause chronic pain LC remain unknown visceral hyperalgesia central sensitizationhave suggest part pathophysiology . To reduce incidence chronic pain LC , conduct randomize control trial investigate whether calot 's triangle block combine PCIA superior PCIA reduce incidence chronic pain LC . This study approve institutional review board First Affiliated Hospital Chongqing Medical University . The protocol design accordance Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) statement . All potentially eligible participant ask give write informed consent enrol study . This study prospective , randomize , double-blind , control clinical trial guide standard good clinical practice ( GCP ) , eligible participant divide two group : group CTB group PCIA , primary ass outcome incidence chronic pain LC intensity acute pain LC . Participants group CTB receive single injection ropivacaine calot 's triangle surgical dissection combine PCIA post-operatively . Participants group PCIA receive single injection calot 's triangle normal saline surgical dissection PCIA post-operatively . The primary outcome study incidence chronic pain LC . The secondary outcome study acute post-operative pain , moderate-severe pain , rescue medication adverse event associate post-operative analgesia . This study conduct supervision independent auditor . Every week , auditor check data participant day surgery conduct . Assessment pain intensity prognostic outcome must confirm auditor sample population . When disagreement surgeon anesthesiologist evaluate prognosis patient , auditor must solve disagreement discussion evaluator . Data double-entered two statistician limitation access lock statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
