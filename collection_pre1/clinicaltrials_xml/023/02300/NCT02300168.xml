	<brief_title>Neuromuscular Blockade : Outcome Recovery Laparoscopic Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Performing bariatric surgery short-stay procedure ongoing trend many center around world . For morbidly obese ( MO ) patient , anesthetic approach base choose drug least potential accumulation . This allow rapid clear-headed recovery contributes reduce duration perioperative time . However , neuromuscular blockade ( NMB ) require surgery , complete recovery major factor may prevent rapid fast-track discharge . In Canada , reversal NMB achieve use acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) inhibitor , mostly neostigmine , must administer certain level spontaneous recovery order ensure complete reversal . This elongate time spent operating room ( OR ) , prevent therefore fast track surgery procedure . On hand , effort shorten time spent OR , AChE inhibitor may sometime administer early spontaneous recovery , post-operative residual curarization ( PORC ) may observe . In post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) , PORC may particularly problematic , possible occurrence critical respiratory event ( CREs ) . This turn also associate significant delayed discharge . Because aforementioned inconvenience , Canadian anesthesiologist reluctant induce deep NMB . Consequently , intra-abdominal pressure remain non optimal surgery , facilitate surgeon work , addition increase perioperative time . This problem particularly frequent case bariatric surgery . The current study explore question perspective surgeon satisfaction patient quality recovery .</detailed_description>
