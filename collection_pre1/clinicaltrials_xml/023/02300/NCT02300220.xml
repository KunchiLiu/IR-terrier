	<brief_title>Targeted Retreatment COPD Exacerbations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD long term lung condition patient suffer recurrent symptom flare-up , call 'exacerbations ' .

Previous research group show patient exacerbation completely recover two week start treatment likely suffer another one early completely recover . This study aim test whether prevent early re-exacerbation give extra course antibiotic , compare placebo . Patients experience exacerbation COPD treat antibiotic , two week start treatment , invite attend screen visit . Patients eligible study fully recover visit ( i.e . either still symptoms blood test show still inflammation present ) fulfil diagnostic measure COPD .
