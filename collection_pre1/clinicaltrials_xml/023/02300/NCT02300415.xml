	<detailed_description>Severe sepsis sepsis shock common emergency department , high mortality rate . The potential severity disease impose diagnosis early possible start antibiotic therapy hemodynamic support . The conventional biomarkers important support emergency physician . However , comparison sensitivity specificity new biomarkers , like presepsine , suggest efficient indication . Presepsine soluble fragment CD14 , concentration reflection cellular activity ( macrophage monocyte ) response sepsis 's aggression . Today , 's possible ass presepsine value bedside , new device ( PATHFAST ) , 17 minute , reinforce interest biomarker . We conduct single-center , prospective , non-interventional study , december 2014 July 2015 university emergency department Nice . The primary outcome compare sensitivity presepsine lactate diagnosis severe sepsis septic shock . The dosage presepsine make 194 patient 18 year old , least two S.I.R.S criterion , suspect infection , presence one organ failure . The secondary outcome asses link presepsine value germ responsible sepsis , correlation presepsine value admission mortality J-28 . And try determine correlation initial presepsine value , P.I.R.O score .</detailed_description>
