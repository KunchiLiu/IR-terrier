	<brief_summary>Interventions primary HIV infection ( PHI ) modify immune control clinical evolution chronic phase . Although several study suggest benefit antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) PHI , indication ART still universally recommend . The investigator randomize patient PHI , favourable immunological profile well controlled ART , undergone structure treatment interruption alone low dos IL-2 , stop ART thereafter . The endpoint immune control HIV replication time resume ART . Immunological profile , specific CD4 CD8 responses clinical data analyse group 48 week , long follow-up , nine year since final ART stop .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intermittent ART Primary HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design include two phase . The first phase consist four STI 8 week ( off-ART ) , separate 16 week treatment -or time necessary reach PVL &lt; 20 copies/mL- ( on-ART ) . At end 4th off-ART cycle ( week 0 ) interim evaluation perform second phase initiate . During second phase , first 6 patient receive ART reach PVL &lt; 20 copies/mL , discontinue thereafter ( final stop ) . The last 6 patient receive ART low dos IL-2 . ARV therapy stop reach PVL &lt; 20 copies/mL ( final stop ) IL-2 6 month treatment . IL-2 prescribe dose 750.000 UI/m2 daily self-administrated patient previous trained specialize nurse . ART resume patient drop CD4 cell count le 350 cell/mm3 two consecutive determination patient develop opportunistic infection . A long term follow analysis perform 3 , 6 9 year since final stop . It include time resume ART , clinical event , survival rate , CD4-CD8-CD4/CD8 ratio .</detailed_description>
