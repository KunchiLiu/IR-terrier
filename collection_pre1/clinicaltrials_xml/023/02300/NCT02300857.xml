	<brief_title>Effects Macronutrient Diet Brain Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A question critical field obesity `` cause overweight obese individual overeat ? '' One common explanation hold weight gain population-level cause increase widespread availability highly palatable food . An alternative explanation biological effect modern diet produce effect central nervous system periphery augment homeostatic hedonic hunger . Reducing glycemic load preferentially maintain total energy expenditure weight-loss maintenance ( Ebbeling et al. , 2012 ) , group investigator previously show late postprandial period , nutrient-controlled high glycemic load vs. low glycemic load meal increase rest regional cerebral blood flow nucleus accumbens ( Lennerz et al. , 2013 ) , part mesoaccumbal reward circuitry implicate crave addiction . However , effect macronutrient composition blood flow activity homeostatic reward-related brain region fully ascertain study acute ingestion single macronutrient , generalize mixed-nutrient meal consume part typical American diet . Further , retrospective design rely participant report frequency recent macronutrient ingestion prospective design limited duration diet prescription address critical question long-term , cumulative effect dietary composition brain function . Therefore , investigator propose approach identify brain response randomize , mixed-meal diet vary macronutrient composition long-term weight-loss maintenance diet , use arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) blood-oxygen-level-dependent ( BOLD ) -based functional connectivity . To explore outcome , investigator partner ongoing Framingham State Food Study ( NCT02068885 ) : Following weight loss standard diet , 150 overweight obese adult ( age 18 65 year ) randomize one three weight-loss maintenance diet vary carbohydrate fat ratio 20 week . Investigators invite subject already enrol Framingham State Food Study participate goal enrol 75 subject ( aim equally divide per diet group follow randomization assign test diet parent study ) . Participants complete 1 morning visit MRI imaging center Brigham Women 's Hospital approximately 14-20 week weight maintenance test diet phase . During visit , undergo fast baseline brain imaging session , consume assign diet breakfast meal , undergo late postprandial brain imaging session . Participants additionally provide frequent rating food craving , mood , anxiety level throughout visit . The main outcome rest blood flow nucleus accumbens connect striatal region late postprandial period , additional secondary outcome include blood flow hypothalamus connectivity hypothalamus late postprandial period .</detailed_description>
