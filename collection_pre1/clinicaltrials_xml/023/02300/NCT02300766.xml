	<brief_title>Cerebellar Mutism Syndrome Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Cancer account 22 % death among child Europe thus lead non-traumatic pediatric cause death . Central nervous system ( CNS ) tumours constitute 25 % childhood cancer , majority locate posterior fossa . One troublesome late effect neurosurgery tumour cerebellar mutism syndrome see 25 % patient . It characterize mutism , hypotonia , ataxia irritability . The exact aetiology , risk factor , clinical course treatment yet identify . The aim study accomplish . Method : This observational prospective multicentre study include minimum 500 paediatric patient posterior fossa CNS tumour Nordic country . Additional country might add later study run . The study start fall 2014 20 centre 5 Nordic country . Prior pilot study perform 43 Danish adult patient validate fine-tune registration procedure . All patient treat accord local standard , clinical data collect image review centrally . To calculate participation rate annual number include patient country compare number register patient cancer register respective country year . A blood sample genetic analysis collect patient . The patient ' neurology speech function examine pre-operatively repeatedly post-operatively , include record standardised speech sample . All data collect trough , purpose develop , online database . Registration data The following data register follow 5 time point : 1 . Preoperatively Hospital country , patient relate variable ( date birth , handedness , bilingualism , sex date diagnosis ) . Medical history ( Previous neurological/neuropsychological/ psychiatric problem , comorbidities , previous operation treatment tumour , previous regular use kind medication ) . Preoperative neurological status examine language speech test perform record . If patient young 2 year bedside assessment speech perform instead test . A blood sample genetic analysis drawn together standard blood sample . Alternatively do time follow-up . 2 . Postoperatively within 72 hour surgery Operation relate variable ( date , duration course operation , surgical position , surgical approach , tumour removal method ) , complication , technology employ , preoperative hydrocephalus estimate completeness tumour resection . 3 . Postoperatively within 1-4 week surgery Approximately 1-2 week post-op : Postoperative language speech status old 2 year , record speech sample . Neurological examination . Glucocorticoid administration pre- , intra- postoperatively plus medication use treat CMS postoperatively effect . Kind ( ) imaging perform tumour pre- postoperatively . Approximately 4 week post-op : Development treatment postoperative intracranial haematoma hydrocephalus , leakage cerebrospinal fluid need ventilator . 4 . Postoperatively 2 month surgery Postoperative development CMS , detail survey status CMS affect include record speech sample neurological examination . Medications use treat CMS since last registration effect . 5 . Postoperatively 12 month surgery Language neurological status include speech sample old 2 year . Medications use treat CMS since last registration effect . Other anti-cancer treatment give ( chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy ) . Results pathology department regard kind tumour histology genetics . Registration whether neuropsychological assessment ( ) perform . Kind ( ) imaging perform tumour since 1st follow-up . Copies MRIs description perform pre-op , right operation approximately . 12 month post-op obtain . All register data examine third party check miss data misentries order ensure high quality data . In case miss data misentries third party contact person make registration . The database administer child 's cancer epidemiology group ( CCEG ) Karolinska Hospital Stockholm , also responsible Swedish child 's brain tumour registry leukaemia database Nordic Society Pediatric Hematology Oncology ( NOPHO ) Other course : In case acute surgery , coma etc . information study offer participate give within 7 day operation . In case preoperative data patient obtain patient 's medical record and/or parent , preoperative speech sample perform . These patient include analysis whether preoperative speech language status affect risk develop CMS , include study analysis . Speech sample perform postoperatively exactly manner patient include operation able monitor patient 's speech postoperatively register sign CMS . Should patient posterior fossa tumour surgery perform 12 month follow-up period , patient re-start follow-up programme date . A separate pre-op post-op registration perform , use analysis risk first versus second surgery . New genetic blood sample necessary case . Should patient posterior fossa tumour surgery perform last 12 month follow-up , patient offer participate study new consent obtain . New genetic blood sample necessary case . If patient leaf study reason follow-up 12 month post-op , separate form fill explain patient leave . If patient turn 18 include study , new consent participate give patient him- /herself . Blood sample analyse : As soon patient register , study centre request 2 ml anticoagulated blood sample genetic profiling ( Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism ( SNP ) analysis ) . The investigator use newly develop single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) sequence strategy allow cost-effective map 25-30.000 genetic polymorphism within biological domain could potentially link development CMS ( e.g . inflammation , vascularization , blood-brain-barrier marker , apolipoprotein E lipoprotein pathway gene ) . The genetic data link clinical data identify genetic variant associate risk CMS course CMS . Specifically investigator map SNPs gene know likely link pathway , include mRNA binding site first order protein-protein interaction . Rather expect large effect single SNPs , strategy approach use front-line bioinformatics pathway analysis explore additive effect numerous SNPs involve biological pathway . This identify high-impact pathway , although individual low-impact SNPs . The result obtain could guide future therapeutic approach CMS . If custodial parent consent child contribute blood sample study , child may still participate study , albeit part involve genetic analysis . The sample well rest study data protect Act Processing Personal Data Act Health Act . All MRIs analyze neuroradiologists respect tumour resection neuroradiographic sign associate CMS . All speech record analyze speech therapist respect sign associate CMS . The result neuropsychological test may perform routinely separately obtain analyze . Power calculation : For surgical hypothesis , assume 35 % patient operate approach low risk CMS ( assume 10 % ) remain 65 % patient operate use approach carry 20 % risk CMS , investigator 80 % power able identify difference 5 % significance level investigator include total 450 patient . For genetic analysis , several pathway SNP-profiles explored appropriate adjustment multiple comparison . Multiple SNPs due randomness find related risk CMS . Their true biological significance subsequently validate internal validation , investigator explore SNPs biological pathway , e.g . SNPs gene haplotype SNPs affect cod regulatory region identify risk-related gene significantly associate risk CMS randomly select SNPs . Furthermore , genes/SNPs explore bioinformatic prediction impact SNPs protein-folding , bind affinity etc . Once high-risk SNPs/genes/pathways identify publish , investigator attempt confirm independent patient cohort Europe US . Based project overall risk CMS 20 % , frequency specific SNP ( SNP-profile ) 30 % , project double risk CMS group harbour SNP ( SNP-profile ) , investigator 90 % power able identify genetic predisposition 5 % significance level , total 343 patient include study . Thus , study sufficient power . To analyze effect mention variable ( surgical method , administration corticosteroid , handedness etc . ) risk develop CMS investigator perform univariate multivariate regression analyse well standard descriptive analysis . These analysis perform use SAS . Discussion : The study large prospective multicenter study cerebellar mutism syndrome date , first one kind systematically gather detailed information 1 ) surgical approach least likely cause syndrome , 2 ) syndrome best treat , 3 ) role genetics 4 ) difference incidence clinical course syndrome different patient . The ultimate aim study reduce incidence improve treatment cerebellar mutism syndrome lead harmonization treatment CNS tumour patient across Nordic country .</detailed_description>
