	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency anaemia ( IDA ) affect approximately 4.7 million people UK , child pre-menopausal woman high risk ( 1 ) . Each year 6.8 million prescription oral iron fill England alone ( NHS Information Centre data ) . However , gastrointestinal symptom limit adherence 10-30 % otherwise healthy patient ( 2-4 ) 50 % patient gastrointestinal disorder ( 5 ) . Simple ferrous iron salt constitute vast majority currently prescribe oral iron cheap well absorb . However , also poorly tolerate thus , believe , expensive NHS . Funded Medical Research Council , develop alternative oral iron supplement , name IHAT ( iron hydroxide adipate tartrate ) , efficacious therapy IDA minimal side-effects . In study propose aim ass total health cost associate current oral iron supplement , hence , define clinical unmet need alternative treatment . We use Clinical Practice Research Datalink ( CPRD ) GOLD data ( ) estimate pattern prescribe oral iron primary care general population ( ii ) develop health economics model pre-menopausal woman . These data provide evidence total health system cost associate current oral iron treatment . Furthermore , study provide data cost-effectiveness total health system cost alternative effective treatment minimal side-effects could estimate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our research objective gather evidence unmet clinical need safe , low-side-effect oral iron UK . To achieve objective aim determine : 1 . Pattern prescribe oral iron primary care GP practice England : estimate prescription rate , efficacy intolerance treatment form currently prescribe oral iron . 2 . Health economics use ferrous iron salt primary care : estimate pattern individual response treatment ; determine cost ferrous iron ( sulphate , fumarate gluconate ) therapy pre-menopausal woman primary care , develop cost-effectiveness model alternative treatment minimal side-effects .</detailed_description>
