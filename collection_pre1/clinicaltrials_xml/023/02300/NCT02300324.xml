	<brief_summary>There current evidence suggest eat cruciferous vegetable like broccoli , cauliflower , cabbage beneficial health contain compound think reduce risk disease cancer cardiovascular disease . Cruciferous vegetable able deliver body group compound call isothiocyanate ( ITCs ) think responsible health-promoting effect . Sulforaphane ( SF ) broccoli one study ITCs anticancer property extensively investigate vitro vivo model . The investigator propose undertake intervention study measure bioavailability SF soup use another intervention study call ESCAPE . The investigator would like investigate rate extent SF reach systemic circulation excrete urine measuring SF metabolites plasma urine sample collect apparently healthy participant consumption three type broccoli + stilton soup . The three type soups standard broccoli + stilton soup two high-glucoraphanin ( SF precursor ) broccoli + stilton soup able deliver different level SF . This study fund Biotechnology Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) Prostate Cancer foundation ( PCF ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Bioavailability Of Sulforaphane From Broccoli Soups Study ( BOBS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , double-blinded , three-phase crossover trial investigate bioavailability SF follow consumption broccoli + stilton soup contain different concentration glucoraphanin . The study population consist non-smoking men woman age 18 65 year old . Participants undergo three phase separate minimum two week ( wash-out period ) . Each phase consist 48 hour pre-intervention diet restriction , study day involve 8 hour cannulation Human Nutrition Unit ( HNU ) Institute Food Research ( IFR ) collection 24 hour urine blood sample follow morning . Participants randomly allocate one three soup phase . The following soup test three phase : ) 300g standard broccoli + stilton soup , ii ) 300g Beneforte® broccoli + stilton soup , iii ) 300g Beneforte Extra broccoli + stilton soup . Beneforte Beneforte extra broccoli especially cultivate deliver high sulforaphane level consumption . All three broccoli variety appearance flavour thus enable blind human intervention study undertaken . Broccoli soup manufacture food company supply soup lead supermarket retailer United Kingdom . Each phase consist 48 hour pre-intervention diet restriction , study day ( study day 1 ) comprise approximately nine hour stay HNU involve cannulation . The following morning participant visit HNU 1 hour collection single blood sample 24 hour post-dose follow breakfast . During study day 1 , eleven 10ml blood sample collect course day participant follow timepoints : 0 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 360 , 480 min 24 hour blood sample . Six urine sample collect follow timepoints : 0 , 0-2 , 2-4 , 4-6 , 6-8 , 8-24 hour . The three phase separate minimum two week washout period . For duration study , participant require follow glucosinolate-free diet total nine day three day per phase . The three day split 48 hour ( 2 day ) prior study day , 24 hour ( 1 day ) study day well follow morning 24 hour blood urine sample collect . After 24 hour urine blood sample collect , participant resume normal diet minimum two week 48 hour prior next study day . This reduce contribution glucosinolate food impact result study . The involvement participant last approximately 11-12 week .</detailed_description>
