	<detailed_description>Oxidative stress , define imbalance pro antioxidant molecular specie favor former , recently recognize potential mechanism peripheral muscle dysfunction associate COPD . series study propose well understand role source oxidative stress skeletal muscle patient COPD . Specifically , three main aim address follow question regard COPD , skeletal muscle , oxidative stress : oxidative stress prevalent , oxidative stress occur , consequence oxidative stress COPD ? overall hypothesis test COPD result shift toward great intramuscular oxidative stress , least part , responsible diminished mechanical efficiency great peripheral muscle fatiguability muscular work often associated disease . The vascular consequence augment free radical load alter vascular function disruption local match perfusion metabolism skeletal muscle exercise . These crucial change result cascade factor local hypoxia elevate vascular shear stress , enter vicious cycle lead generation free radical , especially physical work . It propose imbalance pro antioxidant potential , toward oxidative stress , play significant role attenuate exercise capacity reduce muscle fatigue resistance associate COPD .</detailed_description>
