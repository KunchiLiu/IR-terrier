	<detailed_description>Borderline personality disorder ( BPD ) serious debilitate psychiatric condition characterize instability relationship , emotion , identity , behaviour . Affecting 2-6 % general population , BPD associate high rate self-harm ( suicide attempt non-suicidal self-injury ) , mortality suicide , consequent heavy use public health resource , make one expensive psychiatric disorder treat . Psychotherapy recognize first-line treatment BPD , dialectical behaviour therapy ( DBT ) demonstrate strong empirical support . Although DBT efficacious self-harming individual BPD , increasingly available past 10 year , demand DBT exceed exist resource . Within current climate rise health care cost limited resource , length ( 12 month ) intensive nature ( entail multiple treatment component ) standard DBT major barrier adoption . Subsequently , DBT program lengthy wait list . Inadequate accessibility treatment specific Canada ; global problem . In clinical practice , DBT often abbreviate , clinician deliver component believe appropriate , despite evidence base almost entirely consist study 1 year DBT . There data optimal length treatment . Therefore , primary aim proposal examine efficacy abbreviated course DBT ( include component treatment ) compare evidence-supported 12 month DBT . Our principal question : How clinical outcome 6 month DBT ( DBT-6 ) compare standard 12 month ( DBT-12 ) treatment chronically self-harming individual BPD ? Assessments conduct pretreatment 3-month interval 24 month ( i.e. , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 month ) . Hypotheses : ( 1 ) Patients DBT-6 arm show equivalent reduction frequency severity self-harm across treatment phase one-year post treatment follow-up phase compare patient DBT-12 arm . ( 2 ) Patients present high rate self-harm impulsive behaviour reduction frequency severity self-harm behaviour comparable DBT-6 arm DBT-12 arm , course treatment phase 1-year post treatment follow-up . Patients present co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder , generalize anxiety disorder , cluster A C personality disorder exhibit less reduction frequency severity self-harm behavior DBT-6 arm compare DBT-12 arm , course treatment phase 1-year post treatment follow-up .</detailed_description>
