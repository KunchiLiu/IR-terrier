	<brief_summary>Neonatal Encephalopathy serious condition arise unexpected lack cerebral blood flow oxygen supply foetal brain time birth . Every year , approximately one million baby die neonatal encephalopathy low middle-income country quarter death occur India . In past decade , number clinical trial high-income country show cool therapy along optimal neonatal intensive care reduces death neurodisability neonatal encephalopathy . Cooling therapy use standard therapy neonatal encephalopathy high income country , include UK . Although burden neonatal encephalopathy far high low middle-income country , safety efficacy data cool therapy high income cooling trial extrapolate setting , due difference population co-morbidities sub-optimal neonatal intensive care . The HELIX trial proposes examine whether whole body cool 33.5°C initiate within 6 hour birth continue 72 hour reduces death neurodisability 18 month neonatal encephalopathy public sector neonatal unit India . A total 408 baby moderate severe neonatal encephalopathy recruit participate centre India 18 24 month period . The baby randomly allocate whole body cool usual care .

	<detailed_description>Although burden neonatal encephalopathy far high low middle-income country , safety efficacy data cool therapy high income cooling trial extrapolate setting . Firstly , high-income country clinical trial date provide cool therapy along side optimal tertiary neonatal intensive care cardiorespiratory support . Such tertiary care include 1:1 expert nursing care , continuous clinical monitoring vital physiological parameter , close attention acid base electrolyte balance , optimal ventilatory inotropic support , parenteral nutrition , nitric oxide cerebral function monitoring . These centre also access extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) facility infants persistent pulmonary hypertension meconium aspiration may adversely affected cooling . The safety efficacy cool therapy without optimal tertiary neonatal intensive care unknown . Even best resourced public sector tertiary neonatal unit India low middle-income country facility expertise comparable neonatal unit high-income cooling trial originally perform . The danger extrapolate safety efficacy data high income country intensive care unit low middle-income country well know , recently re-emphasise increased mortality see fluid boluses child septic shock Africa ( FEAST trial ) . The HELIX trial examine safety cool therapy resourced public sector neonatal unit India , above-mentioned facility provide optimal tertiary intensive care , alongside cool therapy . Secondly , significant population difference baby suffer encephalopathy high-income country low middle-income country higher incidence perinatal infection meconium aspiration . Antenatal care often poor , intra uterine growth restriction delay hospital admission obstruct labour extremely common . Thus brain injury may chronic already establish , window period cooling may already lose time baby bear . Two recent NICHD hypothermia workshop ( 2011 2013 ) 14 involve expert therapeutic hypothermia recommend rigorous evaluation cool therapy urgently conduct LMIC , ensure benefit one important discovery neonatal medicine lose population need . Without rigorous evaluation may creep introduction cool therapy , constantly sabotage residual safety concern , never widely use India LMIC . Cooling study low middle-income country A number small randomise control trial report low middle-income country . Individual study small poor quality . The large trial report China exclude baby risk perinatal sepsis substantial methodological concern . Two study report increased mortality cooling . Meta-analysis trial show trend towards reduce mortality , however statistically significant ( RR 0.74 ; 95 % CI 0.4 1.3 ) . More importantly , confidence interval wide therefore significant benefit harm exclude . There data long term neurological follow cool therapy . In preparation HELIX trial , investigator conduct feasibility study cool therapy use servo control cool device ( Tecotherm ) 2013/14 , Madras Medical College ( MMC ) , Chennai . The data 58 cooled baby neonatal encephalopathy 112 contemporary 'un match ' encephalopathic baby usual care ( normothermia ) admit neonatal unit 15 month period give . Although neonatal mortality cool baby appear high high-income country cool trial , low contemporary encephalopathic population hospital . High incidence gastric bleeds persistent metabolic acidosis see group . The case control match possible control baby unwell , therefore high mortality ( 29 % versus 54 % ; Table 1 ) ; nevertheless , data reassure support evaluation cool therapy rigorous randomise control trial ( manuscript preparation ) . A paradox private public sector health care exist India low middleincome country . Private hospital often well equipped good tertiary intensive care facility , affordable low income population . Moreover , hospital relatively small ( annual delivery rate less 2000 ) , low encephalopathy burden . Public sector hospital hand , tend much large ( 20,000 30,000 delivery per year ) offer free health care low income population . These hospital huge encephalopathy burden ( inborn out-born baby ) , lack resource good neonatal intensive care facility . Thus , significant health benefit occur neuroprotective therapy usable indeed effective public sector hospital low middle-income country , rather private health care . The HELIX trial carefully design generalizable under-resourced neonatal unit sub optimal neonatal intensive India low middle-income country , bear high neonatal encephalopathy burden . However , neonatal unit need good quality basic neonatal care , include facility neonatal resuscitation , administration intravenous fluid , drug basic respiratory support , optimal cardio respiratory 1:1 nursing care facility . The HELIX trial conduct real life situation resourced public sector neonatal unit lack optimal tertiary intensive care India . Exclusively clinical criterion use case identification recruitment , laboratory parameter , neuroimaging cerebral function monitoring require eligibility . The entire cooling therapy provide exist clinical team , research team involve accurate high quality data collection , trial result reflective routine clinical scenario . Clearly , population co-morbidities resource Indian neonatal unit different African low-income country neonatal unit . If HELIX trial result suggest cool safe effective Indian neonatal unit , next stage would evaluate cool therapy resourced neonatal unit Africa , low-income country . The Helix trial two arm un-blinded pragmatic randomise control trial whole body cool versus standard care , neonatal encephalopathy low middle-income country . The investigator plan randomise 408 baby trial , investigator anticipate approximately 1200 baby screen eligibility . The treatment duration ( cool therapy ) 72 hour , however temperature recruited baby monitor first week birth . Any temperature rise &gt; 37.5°C active treat , cool usual care arm , fever increase brain injury adverse outcome neonatal encephalopathy . The neurological outcome assess 18 22 month age . The trial duration 4 year , consist 4 week start period , 24 month recruitment period , 18 month follow-up period , 5 month data analysis write .</detailed_description>
