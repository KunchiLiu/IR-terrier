	<brief_summary>Pulmonary dysfunction present patient heart failure observe decrease maximal aerobic capacity compare healthy people . Lung function deterioration manifest , presence muscle fatigue dyspnea exertion , loss functional capacity , activity limitation daily live . Those manifestation influence perception quality life patients1 . Patients heart failure need develop change lifestyle daily activity aim maintain clinical control prevent onset complication disability . If change often perform , might carry big burden individual family healthcare system due increase morbidity mortality patients2 . Systematic review conduct developed country ( USA3 , UK4 Canada5 ) develop country ( Colombia6 ) show telehealth produce positive effect individual chronic disease heart failure . This kind intervention seem effective prevent hospitalization non-elective emergency visit . In Brazil , telenursing still non-standardized non-diffused intervention . In perspective , telenursing represent soft new tool provide quality care . It certainly allow orientation training patient , permanence home , reduces unnecessary hospitalization . Additionally , intervention , allow management nursing time strengthen professional autonomy7 . The principal aim study describe protocol use MRE study . The objective MRE trial test hypothesis telenursing contributes improvement lung function medium term , patient heart failure continuous education .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>METHODS STUDY DESIGN It blinded- controlled-randomized clinical trial parallel-group , six month follow-up . The trial protocol perform referral outpatient center accompany patient heart failure . This unit part public health system city Salvador - Bahia , second large city Northeast Brazil . The Brazilian health system one large public health system world . Ensures full access , universal free entire population country . Bolstered broad concept health , health system create 1988 Brazilian Federal Constitution , health system 180 million Brazilians . Run-in The run-in period last 15 day . After run-in , eligible patient part study , accord follow criterion : 1 . To participate telenursing education program ; 2 . To fill-in diary symptom sign , daily ; 3 . To receive call research team weekly ; 4 . To attendance appointment window 15 day schedule date ; 5 . To predisposed perform spirometry testing , six-minute walk test , pulse oximetry , electrocardiography , respond questionnaire quality life scale dyspnoea . Wash After begin project , patient present follow criterion must exclude : 1 . Pregnancy ; 2 . Hospitalization 30 day ; 3 . Do attend monthly visit inside search window 15 day schedule date ; 4 . To change residence address among state preclude attendance schedule visit ; 5 . Death ; 6 . To discharge outpatient clinic Hospital study ; 7 . Subsequent diagnostic acute chronic respiratory disease physical/mental condition make impossible participate study ; 8 . To Cease participate telenursingprogram study . RANDOMIZATION The sample size calculation perform Sealed Envelope TM program . 156 patient need ( 78 per group ) , use follow indicator : confidence level 95 % , 5 % maximum error permit , statistical power 90 % detect elevation primary endpoint 12 % experimental group . After apply inclusion exclusion criterion , two group source randomization allocate case group control group without replacement . All subject include assigned three-digit sequential number ( eg . 000-999 ) . These number feed group four patient similar characteristic . After , blok size randomization procedure specific software ( www.randomization.com ) . INTERVENTIONS The control group receive standard treatment monitor heart failure ambulatory staff study perform , include pharmacotherapy health education , recommend health team . The intervention group receive standard treatment ongoing follow-up well monitor telenursing period 6 month ( 24 week ) . The application remote nursing monitoring program shall establish contact participant six month , weekly telephone contact day times accorded . We expect duration 5 10 minute per call . The team perform intervention explain content foreseen contact educational approach , allow participant moment comment clarification final question . After conclusion study , control group also receive telenursing intervention proven benefit study . The protocol telenursing intervention deploy continue specialized outpatient clinic chronic disease program , proven benefit . Implementation Program Telenursing The program telenursing consist weekly contact patient heart failure functional class I , II III . For development telenursing , distribute study staff protocol remote monitoring practice nurse form individualized remote monitoring ( appendix A B ) . Intervention group receive educational support material ( educational booklet diary sign symptom ) . The protocol telenursing allows realization standardize professional contact patient educational approach It possible question answer cod , indicate need educational intervention reinforcement appropriate health behavior . The telenursing program protocol base : 1 ) Contact patient telephone , weekly ; 2 ) Distribution explanation educational booklet ; 3 ) Filling diary symptom sign ; 4 ) Record , management markdown visit case non-elective visit , hospitalization fatal episode . Also , follow aspect shall observe : help request associate illness , adaptation live disease , effect drug daily life , availability financial resource disease management , self-image ; emotional social support . The protocol individualize accord need identify monthly consultation and/or weekly contact telenursing call . The protocol address theme : information health education pathology ; monitoring sign symptom ; adherence treatment ; healthy eat weight control ; breathe exercise ; cardiovascular pulmonary risk factor ; physical , occupational sexual activity ; emotional social support . It function guide instrument telenursing , useful clinical management disease , improvement self-care , strengthen communication humanization relation professionals user health service . These item address alternate call avoid wear loss information phone . Before finalize call , offer individual moment express doubt make setting regard intervention . The nurse expect write report end call , check form individual remote monitoring . All call record Skype MP3 Skype Recorder software . The educational booklet contain information heart failure diary symptom sign distribute participant , nurse attribution explain . The booklet develop support material conduct health education telenursing , illustrate , aim answer typical question , easy handle transport , simple visual communication , include accessible individual limit understand write language . It suitable material use individual well assistance parent , family member , caregiver health professional student . Moreover , first contact , develop intervention plan individual , accord need identify analysis medical record nurse consultation . The plan may modify accord need identify telenursing call . Procedures BASELINE : First baseline period hold , individual enrol study . Following questionnaire apply : sociodemographic clinical characterization formulary ; quality life ( Minnesota Living Heart Failure Questionnaire - MLHFQ ) ; Baseline Dyspnoea Index Mahler ; electrocardiogram perform . When participant pass baseline period , precede randomization implementation Visit 01 . Also period , pilot telenursing make , seven study participant undergo intervention order identify necessary change adjustment . VISIT 01 ( start run-in ) : For group : Application structure interview data collection socio-demographic clinical characterization formulary ; Application quality life questionnaire ( MLHFQ ) ; The questionnaire Baseline Dyspnea Index Mahler ; Conducting pulmonary function test spirometry technician certify Brazilian Society Pulmonology ; Achievement Test six-minute walk ; Measurement clinical data ( pulse oximetry , electrocardiogram , measurement anthropometric data ) . Intervention group : explain distribute educational booklet journal sign symptom . Remote monitoring procedure nurse continue education explain , collect best time contact , collect phone ( personal , neighbor , run errand , pay phone street residence mobile phone ) .
