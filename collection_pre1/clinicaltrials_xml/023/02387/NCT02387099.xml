	<brief_summary>The BOLERO-2 study demonstrate benefit patient receive everolimus addition exemestane patient progress during/after non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor ; Routine use everolimus show high rate intolerability due mucositis/stomatitis especially first 12 week treatment lead cause treatment discontinuation relate tumor progression ; GeparQuinto study ( set III : non-responders ) : everolimus give salvage treatment combination paclitaxel patient without response 4 cycle epirubicin/cyclophosphamide with/without bevacizumab . A dose-escalation schema successfully use improve tolerability everolimus together cytotoxic Agent . Everolimus plus exemestane improved prognosis metastatic breast cancer significantly . Desiree-study aim improve tolerability , necessary order achieve adequate dose intensity patient Routine care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The BOLERO-2 study demonstrate enormous benefit patient receive everolimus addition exemestane patient progress during/after non steroidal ( NSAI ) , lead approval everolimus indication . However , experience routine use report high rate intolerability innovative treatment approach especially first 12 week treatment . Most common side effect mucositis/Mucositis consider leading cause treatment discontinuation relate tumor progression . This outside clinical trial experience contrary finding BOLERO-2 , number patient still take full-dose ( 10mg ) everolimus 4 , 8 , 12 week 77.8 % , 75.6 % , 75.6 % , respectively . These finding concordance non-interventional study . However , finding might bias positive pre-selection . In non-responder part ( set III ) neoadjuvant GeparQuinto study , everolimus give salvage treatment combination paclitaxel patient without response 4 cycle epirubicin/cyclophosphamide +/- bevacizumab . A dose-escalation schema successfully use improve tolerability everolimus together cytotoxic agent . In fact addition everolimus paclitaxel lead increase grade 1-4 leukopenia , grade 1-2 thrombocytopenia , leukopenia , skin change hyperlipidemia . Grades 3-4 hematological nonhematological toxic effect infrequent difference treatment arm . Moreover , Ravaud et al perform metaanalysis clinical trial order evaluate potential relationship everolimus exposure , safety efficacy . Previous study show maximum everolimus concentration reach 1-2 hour administer 5-70 mg oral dos , maximum everolimus concentration increase dose-proportional manner 5 mg 10 mg continuous 5-10 mg once-daily dose enables steady state achieve within 1 week . The metaanalysis show two-fold increase minimum concentration everolimus increase probability tumor size reduction ( odds ratio 1.4 ) , associate trend reduce risk PFS event ( risk ratio [ RR ] 0.9 ) , increase risk grade 3 pulmonary toxicity ( RR1.93 ) , Mucositis ( RR 1.49 ) , metabolic toxicity ( RR 1.3 ) . Taking together result suggest dose-dependent antitumor effect everolimus balance correlate increased toxicity . For reason optimal dose schedule need explore within randomize prospective clinical trial , order increase compliance tolerability , maximize efficacy .</detailed_description>
