	<brief_summary>The main objective study utilize Magnetic Resonance Elastography ( MRE ) determine tissue stiffness abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) . For patient AAA , MRE sensitive superior method determine risk rupture AAA base stiffness estimate compare current , crude method assess risk base measurement diameter aneurysm . The investigator also validate stiffness estimate gold standard i.e . mechanical test histopathology AAA patient undergo AAA surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Currently , MRE clinical tool use assess hepatic fibrosis many institution . MRE superior invasive technique ( i.e . biopsy ) mechanical test noninvasive perform vivo physiologic condition . MRE could make diagnose stiffness widely available could revolutionize diagnosis treatment numerous disease affect stiffness soft tissue . Aortic wall `` stiffness '' fundamental biomechanical parameter reflect structural integrity normal aneurysmal aortic tissue . AAAs enlarge time lead sudden rupture death 90 % patient . Surgical endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) recommend AAAs &gt; 5.5 cm diameter . However , previous study report high percentage ( 13 % ) small AAAs ( &lt; 5 cm ) go rupture , even high percentage ( 60 % ) large AAAs ( &gt; 5 cm ) remain stable . Despite poor prognostic value aortic diameter , still primary parameter use time surgical repair . It known change stiffness AAA reveal important information extra-cellular matrix content ; key factor pathophysiological development AAA risk rupture . A non-invasive , spatially resolve estimate aortic stiffness may provide superior determinant risk rupture compare currently use anatomical measure . The relationship non-invasively measure wall stiffness ( WS ) structural integrity aortic wall must elucidate . Therefore , aortic MRE use noninvasive tool estimate stiffness AAAs provide superior diagnostic prognostic information patient develop AAA disease . Entry study open men woman age 18 year old , racial ethnic subgroup . Two separate group patient AAA recruit . One group patient diagnose AAA monitor observe size AAA . The group comprise patient scheduled surgical repair AAA .</detailed_description>
