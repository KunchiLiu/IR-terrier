	<brief_summary>Dental implant widely use treatment option replacement lose teeth due trauma oral disease . The original protocol placement dental implant edentulous space maxilla mandible introduce thirty year ago call two-stage approach , i.e. , surgical placement submerge dental implant subsequent uncovering abutment connection , prosthesis fabrication functional loading approximately 6 month . Today , time surgery load two-stage protocol commonly abbreviate 3-4 month , immediate implant provisionalization emerge reliable predictable option case adequate osseous support , similar survival success rate two-step procedure . Comparison histological healing demonstrate significant difference bone implant contact implant surgically place accord two-stage protocol immediately provisionalized . However , substantial variability note among clinical protocol use study carry far , additional well-designed randomize control trial ( RCTs ) need fully appreciate clinical outcome immediate early loading protocol . The design dental implant subject continuous improvement , implant manufacturer regularly introduce new product use may result accelerated soft hard tissue healing , increase initial implant stability , enhance esthetic outcome . The purpose randomized , control trial compare treatment outcomes use newly-introduced dental implant ( NobelParallel™ CC ) one-stage two-stage protocol . This new implant titanium oxide surface coating ( TiUnite® ) design principles parallel-walled NobelSpeedy Groovy™ implant , internal conical connection . The implant market premarket notification K050406 K073142 ( 510 ( k ) , Food Drug Administration ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible participant ( i.e. , adult 18 year old need dental implant posterior maxillary mandibular region ) refer dental implant treatment Clinics College Dental Medicine approach study investigator aim study explain . Signed informed consent obtain . All patient refer limited field cone beam computer tomography ass presence adequate bone volume area interest , accord standard clinic protocol . Alginate impression obtain fabricate diagnostic stone cast . A vacuum-formed stent manufacture laboratory offer fix reference point longitudinal probing measurement , radiographic stent use polyvinyl siloxane interocclusal record material allow standardized position radiographic holder obtain periapical radiograph projection geometry . At day surgery ( baseline ) , computer-generated sequence assign patient either one-stage twostage treatment arm . In arm , implant place flush bone crest , flap elevation , accord standard treatment protocol . A periapical radiograph obtain immediately completion surgery . Patients one-stage group receive temporary acrylic crown manufacture chair-side visit . Care take relieve crown occlusal laterotrusive contact . The distance soft tissue margin occlusal stent measure use periodontal probe six sit around implant ( mesiobuccal , midbuccal , distobuccal , mesiolingual , midlingual distolingual ) time post-surgical follow-up , 1-2 week surgery . At three month implant surgery , patient two-stage group implant uncover punch oral mucosa , accord standard protocol . An acrylic temporary crown deliver . Soft tissue margin assessment measurement carry , describe , carried time post-surgical follow-up , 1-2 week surgery . At four month implant surgery , patient arm final fixture level impression accord standard protocol fabrication final implant support restoration ( full contour Zirconia abutment crown angulate screw channel ) , deliver approximately 2 week later . Resonance frequency analysis measurement obtain determine implant stability use Ostell™ device . At six month implant surgery , patient treatment group return follow visit reinforce oral hygiene receive oral prophylaxis . Resonance frequency analysis measurement obtain determine implant stability use Ostell™ device . A periapical radiograph obtain , soft tissue margin measurement carry described , peri-implant probe depth assess six site . An alginate impression also obtain produce stone cast use volumetric measurement . At twelve month implant surgery , patient treatment group return follow visit reinforce oral hygiene receive oral prophylaxis . Resonance frequency analysis measurement obtain determine implant stability use Ostell™ device . A periapical radiograph obtain , soft tissue margin measurement carry described , probe depth assess six site around implant . An impression obtain produce cast use volumetric measurement . The 12-month examination conclude study visit .</detailed_description>
