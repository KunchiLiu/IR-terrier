	<brief_summary>This study do test add vitamin D cheese yogurt product help child improve vitamin D intake . All child give six month supply milk product . One group receive yogurt cheese product already sell store , group receive yogurt cheese product add vitamin D. This show milk product add vitamin D help maintain vitamin D intake child health . The investigator ask child 2 8 year old participate . Children must medical condition affect bone vitamin D level . They must take vitamin D supplement medication affect bone . This study last 6 month . The investigator expect 60 child Montreal area participate study . Children randomly place one two study group . There equal number child group . All group go exact procedure study ; difference group amount vitamin D milk product consume day . Families know group child study complete . Children continue drink regular milk home investigator provide flavour yogurt cheese eat every day entire 6 month study . Families give fresh supply yogurt cheese product every 4 week along instruction . There 3 study meeting parent child attend take place Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit . The clinic locate Macdonald Campus McGill University Ste . Anne-de-Bellevue , QC . The first visit start study , second end 3 month last visit end 6 month study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fortified Cheese Yogurt Products Vitamin D Status Young Children ? Phase 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : 1 . Establish much vitamin D intake food require maintain vitamin D status consistent 75 nmol/L serum 25 ( OH ) D child begin UVB-void period ( begin October ) end winter period ( end April ) . The amount vitamin D select base Phase 1 data ( January April 2014 ) . It hypothesize total intake half EAR 400 IU ( i.e . 200 IU/d typical intake young child ) result exceed serum 25 ( OH ) D 40 nmol/L population target aligns current EAR value . Intakes reach RDA 600 IU support serum concentration 25 ( OH ) D 75 nmol/L ( enable investigation regard functional outcome bone BMC BMD ) . Secondary Objectives : 2 . Demonstrate child higher vitamin D status ( ≥ 75 nmol/L 25 ( OH ) D ) improve biomarkers bone mineral metabolism compare low vitamin D status ( &lt; 75 nmol/L 25 ( OH ) D ) . It hypothesize child higher vitamin D status lower PTH CTx high P1NP normal iCa , suggest bone health outcome would also improve ; preparation follow-up study . Design : Parallel randomize control study use fortify milk milk product . Population : Healthy child ( n=60 ) 2 8 age Greater Montreal Area . This study use two group ( base result phase 1 ) establish much vitamin D intake food require maintain vitamin D status consistent 75 nmol/L throughout duration winter . Control Group 1 : regular fortify milk + regular cheeses/yogurts Intervention Group 2 : regular fortify milk fortify yogurt cheese Estimated Vitamin D intake 2.5 serving Milk Milk Products Foods1 All serve size ½ Canada 's Food Guide Milk Alternatives Serving . Study Group Fluid Milk ( 2x 125 ml ) Yogurt drink ( 2x93 ml ) Cheese ( 21 g ) Other Foods Total/d Dose-response increment 1 . ( control ) 100 IU ~30 IU tr . IU 10-65 IU 140-195 0 2 . 100 IU 300 IU 300 IU 10-65 IU 410-465 420 IU v grp 1 1 Fluid milk serving base previous data median intake 1.7 servings/d [ IQR 1.0-2.3 ] ; total milk product serve 2.5 [ IQR : 1.7-3.3 ] ; vitamin D intake food provide ~65 IU/d . All serve size ½ Canada 's Food Guide Milk Alternatives Serving . The specially fortified cheese make Agropur Cooperative , St-Hubert , Quebec specially fortify yogurt product make Ultima Foods Inc. , Quebec . All product verify within 5 % vitamin D content . The yogurt beverage 15 IU/93 ml fortify product 150 IU/93 ml . The cheese standard make one fortification level ( 0 300 IU/25 g serve ) . All serve size select base target population typical intake . There difference taste fortify non-fortified product . A 24 h total food intake ( day prior sample ) validate 1 mo food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) calcium vitamin D assessment conduct . Nutrient intake generate use Nutritionist Pro™ ( Axxya Systems LLC , Stafford , TX , US ) Canadian Nutrient File version 2010b . Compliance also monthly telephone survey unused product . Demographics , Skin Pigmentation UVB : Surveys baseline parent legal guardian use estimate socioeconomic status ( education household income ) . Race collect facilitate understanding relationship among culture , skin pigmentation baseline vitamin D status [ 5,6 ] . Data regard sun exposure previous month collect percentage body surface area ( BSA ) expose frequency sunscreen use total hour spend direct sunlight per day . Sun index calculate child necessary ( i.e . travel ) , multiply % BSA expose time spend outside ( minute per day ) . This index consider use sun block , capture survey event travel . Skin type baseline establish measure pigmentation three time site constitutive pigmentation inner upper arm facultative pigmentation forehead , mid-forearm low leg use spectrophotometer ( CM-700d/600d , Konica Minolta , Ramsey , NJ , USA ) . Anthropometry : Height measure use portable stadiometer ( Seca 213 , Seca Medical Scales Measuring Systems , Hamburg , Germany ) body weight measure use digital scale ( Home Collection 63-8711-0 , Trileaf Distribution , ON , Canada : calibrate ) child wear light clothing shoe . Body mass index ( BMI ) calculate . Z-scores weight , height BMI calculate use WHO 2007 growth standards/references child under/over 5 ( WHO AnthroPlus , Geneva , Switzerland ) . A BMI Z-score +2 consider obese important exclusion criterion ; possibly change time . At baseline 6 month , dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) use quantify total body regional fat mass . This do help explain difference response vitamin D intake since central deposition adipose tissue relate vitamin D status adult [ 15 ] . DXA also use measure change BMC BMD 6 month period explore relationship vitamin D status . Measurements take use Hologic 4500A clinical densitometer . Whole body , lumbar spine ( L1-4 ) forearm scan undertaken measure BMC BMD , child wear standardize clothing ( pyjama bottom T-shirt ) . The whole body scan technique also provide total body fat , distinguish subcutaneous visceral fat depot . Abdominal adipose estimate use sub-region analysis full torso last rib iliac crest . Total body fat ( kg % ) trunk fat ( kg ) value available DXA software . Although DXA measure trunk fat mass reflect adipose tissue subcutaneous visceral depot , DXA-derived measure agree well CT woman [ 16 ] . To measure volumetric BMD ( vBMD ) well bone architecture , peripheral quantitative computer tomography ( pQCT ) ( XCT-2000 ; Stratec , Pforzheim , Germany ) use . pQCT able distinguish type bone ( cortical trabecular ) . For tibia , length non-dominant tibia measure distance distance palpate lateral condyle lateral malleolus . Single slice measure 4 % 66 % proximally distal end tibia . The 4 % site provide trabecular measurement whilst 66 % site provide cortical measurement . Blood Sampling Procurement : Fasted ( nothing midnight ) venipuncture sample ( total 6.5 ml ) take ~ 0800 h [ 17 ] ; breakfast follow research site . Vitamin D Status Bone Biomarkers : In serum ( 3 ml whole blood ; store -80°C analysis ) , total 25 ( OH ) D ( 25 µl ) well PTH measure use immunoassay ( Liaison , Diasorin ) proven agreement LC-MS/MS [ 20 ] .</detailed_description>
