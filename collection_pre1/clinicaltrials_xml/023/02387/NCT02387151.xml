	<brief_title>Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Therapy Renal Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation improve survival quality life patient end-stage renal disease . However , despite advance immunosuppressive therapy , long-term allograft survival outcomes improve last decade . A promising novel therapeutic immunosuppressive option treatment renal recipient profound effect fibrosis reaction clinical application mesenchymal stromal cell ( MSCs ) . Allogeneic MSCs offer advantage availability clinical use without delay require expansion . Although believe allo MSCs immune privilege , could possibly elicit anti-donor immune response , may increase incidence rejection/ graft loss impact allograft survival long term . These safety issue study study plan allogeneic MSCs transplant setting . MSCs infuse time point immune suppression lower kidney increase risk develop immune mediate injury . In addition , large amount kidney already sign fibrosis time point MSCs might reduce fibrosis importantly affect long term survival . MSCs Human Leucocyte Antigen ( HLA ) share mismatch donor recipient antibody direct MSCs reduce anti-donor immune respons risk .</detailed_description>
