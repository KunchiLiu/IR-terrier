	<brief_summary>A debilitating consequence diabetes mellitus ( DM ) neuropathy globally affect 20 -30 % diabetic patient 50 % study . The incidence diabetic neuropathy ( DN ) estimate 45 % type 2 diabetic patient 59 % type 1diabetic patient USA . ( DN ) common complication DM . The risk DN rise age , duration DM , vascular disease . It Characterized damage arm leg . The pathophysiology DN promote several risk factor : micro vascular disease , neural hypoxia , hyperglycemia-induced effect At molecular level , primary cause diabetic complication know hyperglycemia , disrupt cellular metabolism formation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) .In aspect nerve function , ROS formation increase neuron 's susceptibility damage . In addition , hyperglycemia impedes production angiogenic neurotrophic growth factor , necessary normal function neuron glial cell maintenance vascular structure .The common presentation nerve damage due effect hyperglycemia neuropathic pain . ( DN ) may cause foot deformity hammertoes unnoticed sore infection numb area foot . Improperly treat infection frequently extend bone require amputation foot.No definitive disease-modifying treatment reverse DN . The current treatment focus tight glycemic control reduce potential risk factor nerve damage DN-associated pain management . In many study , deficiency neurotrophic factor lack vascular support regard key factor development DN .Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) particularly attractive therapeutic agent ability self-renew , differentiate multi lineage cell type , locally secrete angiogenic cytokine , include basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) .These factor report prompt neovascularization support neural regeneration.MSC transfusion report therapeutic agent treatment Cardiovascular disease . Similarly , plausible MSCs may also effective therapeutic agent DN treatment paracrine effect bFGF ( Shibata et al. , 2008 ) VEGF potential differentiate neural cell astrocyte , oligodendrocyte , Schwann cells.The adherent nature MSCs make easy expand culture attractive candidate use cell therapy . Also , MSCs particularly attractive therapeutic agent ability self-renew , differentiate multi lineage cell type , locally secrete angiogenic cytokine , include ( bFGF ) VEGF . Therefore , cell therapy recently emerge attractive therapeutic strategy meet need neurotrophic vascular deficiency DN.In electrodiagnostic study , nerve conduction velocity magnitude measure electrically stimulating nerve . Proper diagnosis DN depend pattern sensory loss , reflex test , electrodiagnostic study , image</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives This study conduct investigate effect Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) transfusion diabetic peripheral neuropathy diabetic patient . ( MSCs ) report secrete various cytokine exhibit angiogenic neuro supportive effect . Study Design Experimental interventional study . phase II clinical trial Ethical committee approval ( ethically approve department ) Internal medicine department Yes Study Methods Population study &amp; disease condition ( e.g woman hepatitis , ……… ) Diabetic patient ( type I , type II ) document peripheral neuropathy determine impaired nerve conduction Inclusion criterion : ( Type I , type II ) diabetic patient age range ( 18-45 ) year , diabetic peripheral neuropathy prove clinical assessment nerve conduction receive treatment diabetic peripheral neuropathy . Exclusion criterion : Decompensated cardiac , renal liver disease . Associated autoimmune disease Associated endocrinal disease Pregnancy , usage contraceptive pill steroid . Methodology detail The study conduct patient diabetic peripheral neuropathy collect internal medicine department ( inpatient patient , male female ) All subject study submit following : ( preparatory visit ( MSCs ) transfusion visit . ) - Thorough clinical assessment general assessment patient , also assessment diabetes complication especially diabetic neuropathy . This include full history examination ( e.g. , pain , sensory loss , ulcer , sensory level , etc… . ) preparatory assessment do internal medicine department . - Venous blood drawn morning overnight fast pre ( MSCs ) transfusion visit . Plasma biochemical blood measurement determine standard laboratory procedure central lab clinical pathology department , Kasr Alaini hospital ) - Fasting blood glucose level , 2 hour postprandial . - C-peptide . - Hb A1C . - Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor ( bFGF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) ELISA . - Complete blood picture . - Liver function form ALT , AST - Kidney function form serum creatinine . - fundus examination - Nerve conduction study neurophysiology unit . - Bone marrow aspiration 90 ml local anesthesia first visit preparatory visit mention , patient admit 12 hour monitor closely avoid anaphylaxis ( steroid , anti-allergic treatment ) , complication , discharge . To avoid infection : During bone marrow aspiration , procedure do complete aseptic precaution , place sterile tube contain pre-servative-free heparin ( Sigma-Aldrich , St. Louis , USA ) Separation process sample do good manufacture procedure ( GMP ) : Bone Marrow Aspirate ( BMA ) withdraw good sterilization skin isolate area . Processing sample do laminar air flow ; supply disposable sterile . Technique : Separation mononuclear cell : The bone marrow aspirate dilute ratio 6:1 phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) 2 mM EDTA ( 30 ml BM aspirate+ 5 ml PBS/EDTA buffer ) . The MNCs separate aseptic condition use Ficoll . Hypaque desity gradient ( density 1.077 , GibcoBRL , Grand Islan , NY , USA ) centrifugation 1800 rpm 20 min MNCs plat 40 ml alpha-modi-field Eagle 's medium ( αMEM ) , serum free medium ; mesencult ( Mesenchymal stem cell culture ) , penicillin ( 100 U/ml ) , streptomycin ( 10 mg/ml ) ,0.5 ml amphotericin B ( Gibco BRL ) 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor ( b-FGF ) ( R &amp; D system , Minneapolis , MN ) incubate 370 c humidify atmosphere contain 5 % CO2 ( Digirolamo et al.1999 ) .after one day , non adherent cell culture presence Mesenchymal medium 3 week change every 1 week ( cambrex Bioscience , Nottingham , uk ) . After reach 80 % confluence MSCs place 10 ml saline infuse intravenously Flow cytometry Surface expression MSCs use anti- ( CD271 , CD34 , CD73 , CD90 , CD105 , CD29 ) monoclonal antibody ( mAbs ) analyze use flow cytometry . MSCs ( 2X105 cell ) suspend PBS contain 1 % BSA stain flurochrome -conjugated mAbs 20 minute ice ( anti-mouse mAanti-CD 271 , CD34 CD73 , CD90 , CD105 , CD29 ; BD Bioscience , MN , USA ) .flow cytometric analysis perform use FACSCaliber ( BD bioscience ) equip cell Quest software.10000 cell pass front laser sample . Each sample analyzed duplicate . A cut value 20 % set categorize sample positive . Mesenchymal stem cell identify morphology immunophenotyping central lab clinical pathology department , Kasr Alaini hospital ( stem cell lab ) . Mesenchymal stem cell transfusion slowly intravenous applied procedure patient take approval inform consent . Follow 3 month Mesenchymal stem cell transfusion fast blood glucose level , 2 hour postprandial , C-peptide , Hb A1C , ( bFGF ) , ( VEGF ) nerve conduction kasr Alaini hospital department mention . Possible Risk ( mention risk ) Anaphylaxis Infection Primary outcome ( Most important outcome assess ) 1- Effect mesenchymal stem cell transfusion diabetic peripheral neuropathy regard improvement clinical symptom like pain , sensory loss improvement nerve conduction . Secondary outcome parameter ( outcome assess ) 1 . Mesenchymal stem cell treatment modality diabetes complication like peripheral neuropathy , avoid hazard patient secondary diabetic peripheral neuropathy . 2 . Improving diabetic condition like lower blood glucose level , decrease insulin requirement improvement general condition .
