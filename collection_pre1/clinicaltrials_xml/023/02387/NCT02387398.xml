	<brief_summary>This study pilot , multi-centered , randomize , clinical trial evaluate safety efficacy perform early Coronary Angiography ( CAG ) versus early CAG post-cardiac arrest patient without ST segment elevation . Safety assess evaluate association major adverse event ( re-arrest , bleeding , pulmonary edema , hypotension , acute renal insufficiency , pneumonia ) early coronary angiogram . Efficacy assess composite endpoint improve leave ventricular regional global function ( regional wall motion analysis leave ventricular ejection fraction ) measure echocardiography prior hospital discharge favourable neurological function ( Cerebral Performance Categories 1 2 ) discharge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Coronary Angiography Versus Delayed Coronary Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac arrest major public health issue . Arizona leader improve long-term survival introduce new innovative resuscitation approach include `` Chest Compression-Only CPR '' `` Cardiocerebral Resuscitation '' . Post-resuscitation care next great opportunity improvement . Early coronary angiography ( CAG ) combine therapeutic hypothermia become recommend standard care post-cardiac arrest patient manifest ST segment elevation electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . However , majority cardiac arrest victim ST segment elevation . There clinical equipoise whether patient benefit early CAG . Subjects qualify study randomize 1:1 one two group . ° Intervention Group-Early coronary angiography ( door-to-angiography ) within 120 minute admission Emergency Department . ° Control Group-No early coronary angiography ( within first six hour admission ) All enrolled patient , treat therapeutic hypothermia standard care , begin simultaneously group within least 2 hour hospital arrival . Subject follow 180 day safety long-term survival .</detailed_description>
