	<brief_summary>Purpose : The goal guide bone augmentation provide alveolar ridge sufficient dimension permit dental implant placement . While wide variety bone graft barrier membrane product commercially available , limited evidence exists support use one technique another . The purpose study radiographically define dimensional bone change follow horizontal bone augmentation use synthetic GUIDOR® ( Sunstar , Inc. ) membrane . Secondary outcome measurement include assessment inflammation , infection , wound heal complication . Participants : A total 60 patient require bone augmentation single bound edentulous site prior dental implant placement select study . This multicenter study 30 patient receive treatment study site . Procedures ( method ) : Patients randomly allocate receive horizontal bone augmentation synthetic GUIDOR® membrane + freeze dry bone augmentation ( FDBA ) , synthetic GUIDOR® membrane alone , xenograft BioGide® membrane + FDBA . CBCT image obtain baseline 6 month post-operatively assess dimensional alveolar ridge change . Additionally , post-operative appointment 1 , 2 , 4 week post-grafting complete assess presence inflammation , infection , wound dehiscence , membrane exposure .</brief_summary>
