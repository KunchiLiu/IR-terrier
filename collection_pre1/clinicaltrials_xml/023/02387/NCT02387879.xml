	<brief_title>A Non-interventional , Observational Post Authorization Study Patients With Multiple Myeloma Treated With Lenalidomide TR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : - Primary : To characterize determine incidence adverse event special interest ; subject treat Lenalidomide real life set give indication . - Secondary : 1 . To observe basic adverse event management approach physicians 2 . To evaluate effectiveness Lenalidomide give indication evaluate prescription line . 3 . To monitor reason patient ' noncompliance lenalidomide usage recommend Patient Information Leaflet . Subjects recruit approximately 36 hematology/oncology site Turkey . In case , decision treat patient make prior decision enter subject study . All subject enrol prospectively follow 36 month , feasible , follow end observe treatment period . This 36 month observation period start end treatment . The observation follow period end 36 month end lenalidomide background observe treatment period , time death , withdrawal consent , loss follow . Following completion treatment , subject follow 30 day every 6 month assess status . Patients eligible signed consent form recruit consecutively . Subjects temporarily discontinue treatment reason 30 day withdraw treatment observation observe safety 36 month ( end treatment ) . If reason discontinuation subject due adverse event , follow adverse event time limited continue resolution stabilization , opinion investigator , additional useful information obtain event subject withdraws consent data collect . Subjects discontinue study switch another treatment . No intervention perform physician . Treatment accord physician 's regular clinical practice . All treatment prescribe treat investigator accordance regular clinical practice . All assessment make accord regular clinical practice treat investigator . Therefore parameter request case report form ( CRF ) investigator 's normal practice carry assessment , field complete . Statistical Analysis : Data subject receive least one dose treatment include safety analysis . Adverse event classify use MedDRA classification system . The severity toxicity grade accord NCI CTCAE V. 4.03 whenever possible . Adverse event frequency tabulate body system MedDRA term . In subject analysis , subject event count . Adverse event summarize worst NCI CTCAE V. 4.03 grade . Adverse event lead death discontinuation treatment , study-drug-related event , serious adverse event list separately . The Kaplan-Meier procedure use characterize time onset time resolution adverse event special interest . Multivariate logistic regression use determine demographic baseline characteristic predictive develop adverse event interest . A forward selection stepwise procedure use identify subset relevant factor . Summary table also provide clinically relevant subgroup . Analyses undertaken explore course neuropathy subject pre-existing neuropathy baseline . Specifically , cross-tabulations use summarize change severity observe lenalidomide treatment summary statistic provide relevant variable .</detailed_description>
