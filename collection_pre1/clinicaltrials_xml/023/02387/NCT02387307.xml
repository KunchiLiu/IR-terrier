	<brief_title>A Study rSIFN-co Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Dose-Escalation Cohort consist Pretreatment Phase , Treatment Phase , Extension Phase , Discontinuation Follow-up . The Pretreatment Phase include Consent Screening Period . The Treatment Phase consist Lead Period first 21-day cycle treatment subject monitor development dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) follow 1 week washout . The Extension Phase start start Cycle 2 intra-subject dose-escalation perform discontinuation study treatment . Upon discontinuation study treatment , discontinuation visit assessment occur within 7 day treatment discontinuation confirmation discontinuation criterion . End treatment information also collect subject discontinue treatment completion cycle 1 treatment . Follow-up visit/final visit evaluation perform 28 ( ±5 day ) day last rSIFN-co administration . The decision undergo dose-escalation next dose level base safety information obtain Cycle 1 . Dose escalation solid tumor utilize `` 3+3 '' design intra-subject dose escalation . 3 dose level rSIFN-co plan determine RD . 3-6 subject assign dose level follow 4 week start administration Cycle 1 . Each cohort start tolerability dose level confirm subject advance solid tumor . For subject start low dose cohort , intra-subject dose escalation allow till grade 3/4 toxicity encounter 24µg TIW reach . In order minimize risk allergic reaction , sponsor advise lead-in period start 15µg . When tolerability dose level confirm observation DLT among 3 subject , escalation next dose level occur . The Expansion Cohort initiate RD . Depending RD , lead period occur accordingly . After lead period , period Cycle 1 final administration perform Treatment Phase subject undergo standardized evaluation safety efficacy rSIFN-co RD . If subject discontinue study treatment , discontinuation visit assessment occur within 7 day last rSIFN-co administration confirmation discontinuation criterion . End treatment information also collect subject discontinue treatment completion cycle 1 treatment . Follow-up evaluation perform 28 day ( ±5 day ) last rSIFN-co administration .</detailed_description>
