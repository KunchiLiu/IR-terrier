	<brief_title>Non-Inferiority Study FRESCA Mask Versus Existing CPAP Mask Treatment Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) common chronic disorder common sleep disorder . OSA occur age group , prevalence increase middle old age . Over last two decade prevalence sleep disorder breathe seem increase men woman , likely due increase rate obesity . Relative increase report 14 % 55 % depend subgroup . For men , current prevalence estimate moderate severe sleep-disordered breathe 10 % 30 49 year-olds 17 % 50 70 year-olds . For woman , correspond prevalence estimate 3 % 9 % . Common consequence OSA include daytime sleepiness , extreme daytime fatigue , slow reaction time , moodiness , belligerence vision problem . OSA also link hypertension , increase cardiovascular morbidity , type 2 diabetes , neurocognitive dysfunction possibly cancer . The study prospective , comparative , open label , randomize crossover assignment , multi-center pivotal study . Up forty-five ( 45 ) subject enrol . It desirable subject population distribute across OSA severity criterion range . The purpose study demonstrate FRESCA mask non-inferior CPAP nasal mask maintain AHI ODI single night PSG assessment .</detailed_description>
