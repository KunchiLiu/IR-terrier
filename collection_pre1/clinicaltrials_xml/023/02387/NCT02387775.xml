	<brief_title>Temperature Control With Esophageal Cooling Device Post Cardiac Arrest Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Temperature control comatose survivor cardiac arrest , critical aspect patient ' care . In context , mild temperature reduction 24 hour post cardiac arrest show improve neurological outcome . Hypothermia commonly induce use combination internal external cooling modality . Internal cool modality include intravenous administration cold crystalloids intravascular cool catheter . External body surface cool achieve use cool blanket , adhesive pad , ice pack . Each method however , limitation . Administration intravenous refrigerate crystalloid ( 4°C ) bolus simple , effective widely available method hypothermia induction . Lack precise temperature control potential pulmonary edema however , make modality unsuitable maintenance phase hypothermia . Surface cool method , cool blanket ice pack , often cause shivering , skin breakdown , obese patient may ineffective . Intravascular cool catheter require time physician insertion bear potential risk line infection deep venous thrombosis . Searching temperature control device overcomes limitation , inefficiency inconvenience exist modality therefore strongly desire . The ideal temperature control modality effective , predictable easy use . An esophageal cooling device recently become available theory may , may possess attribute . To date , publish study examine device 's efficacy . In addition , study document adverse event 's use , evaluate 's ease-of-use bedside . This prospective , interventional study aim assess effectiveness Esophageal Cooling Device ( ECD ) temperature control modality comatose survivor cardiac arrest ( E-Chill trial ) . In addition , observed adverse event ECD use , ease-of-use , nurse satisfaction patient outcome examine .</detailed_description>
