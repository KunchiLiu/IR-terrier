	<brief_summary>1 . To perform observational analysis determine mean translesional gradient measurement ( TLG ) associate difference clinical outcome patient femoropopliteal arterial disease claudication . 2 . Hypothesis : Patients stratify residual translesional gradient &lt; /= 11 mmHg peripheral revascularization angiography alone well clinical outcome patient TLG &gt; 11 mmHg assess six minute walk ( 6MW ) , walk impairment questionnaire score ( WIQ ) , ankle brachial index need repeat procedure 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes Femoropopliteal Disease Stratified Translesional Pressure Gradient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The role measure translesional pressure gradient ( TLG ) peripheral arterial disease lesion iliac artery unclear . In previous study investigator demonstrate pressure wire effectively use measure gradient femoropopliteal ( FP ) arterial bed show good correlation TLGs record exercise ankle brachial index walk impairment score . However evidence effectively modify gradient high residual gradient revascularization medical therapy correlate worse clinical outcome . This prospective , single center , observational clinical study evaluate whether measurement mean residual TLG time angiography and/or immediately endovascular revascularization associate clinically important outcome patient claudication symptom . Prior angiography ask complete ankle brachial index evaluation , baseline six minute walk test walking impairment questionnaire . Arterial access obtain contralateral common femoral artery symptomatic limb feasible . Angiographic image obtain , interpreted clinical decision regard endovascular treatment make per treat physician 's discretion prior obtain translesional pressure gradient . In patient whose angiogram meet exclusion criterion chronic total occlusion ( CTO ) baseline TLG obtain . A 0.014 '' pressure wire/catheter measure pressure insert . After baseline calibration superficial femoral artery , wire insert past narrow lesion popliteal vessel . Intra-arterial adenosine 100-200 mcg give hyperemia measurement record . If intervention plan , repeat measurement obtain end procedure . If intervention plan residual final TLG record . If baseline measurement unable obtain due CTO post intervention residual TLG obtain include analysis . The operator blind pre post TLG measurement turn display monitor away procedure table towards recorder situate procedure room measurement obtain . Patients follow within two week post angiography routine schedule follow obtain repeat ABI , WIQ , six minute walk underwent revascularization . Treating physician study coordinator collect test measurement blind TLG measurement angiography treatment . Patients evaluate 6 month follow repeat ABI , WIQ six minute walk .</detailed_description>
