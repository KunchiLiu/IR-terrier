	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether thalidomide improve effectiveness gefitinib NSCLC patient EGFR mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib Combined With Thalidomide Treat NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To determine 1 year progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate combination thalidomide gefitinib patient harbor EGFR mutation . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate objective response rate 2 year overall survival combination therapy ; 2 . To evaluate safety tolerability combination therapy ; 3 . To acquire preliminary data regard effect thalidomide interleukin-2 level serum . Treatment administer outpatient basis . Thalidomide start dose 50mg QD night . After one week , increase dose 100mg QD night . Aspirin administer 100mg QD continuously . Gefitinib administer 250mg QD continuously . Maintenance Therapy patient respond therapy maintain gefitinib、thalidomide aspirin . Duration Therapy In absence treatment delay due adverse event , treatment may continue one follow criterion applies : 1 . Disease progression , 2 . Intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment , 3 . Unacceptable adverse event ( ) , 4 . Patient decide withdraw study , 5 . General specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must NSCLC confirm Histological cytological ; The NSCLC harbor EGFRmutation previously untreated Patient must measurable lesion stage IIIB IV disease ( include M1a , M1b stag recurrent disease ) ( accord 7th edition tumor node metastasis ( TNM ) classification system ) . Patients age &gt; 18 year &lt; 75 year . Patients must Life Expectancy great 12 week . Patients must ECOG performance status 0 2 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define , within one week prior randomization : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mL platelet &gt; 100,000/mL total bilirubin : within normal institutional limit AST/ALT &lt; 2.5X institutional upper limit normal creatinine≤1.5X institutional upper limit normal urine dipstick proteinuria &lt; le 1+ . If urine dipstick &gt; 1+ 24 hour urine protein must demonstrate &lt; 500mg protein 24 hour allow participation study . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Patients must international normalize ratio ( INR ) &lt; 1.5 partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) great upper limit normal within 1 week prior randomization . Patients history hypertension must wellcontrolled ( &lt; 150 systolic/ &lt; 100 diastolic ) stable regimen antihypertensive therapy . Patients must able swallow tablet . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients uncontrolled illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients receive therapeutic anticoagulation . Prophylactic anticoagulation venous access device allow provided Section 3.10 met . Caution take treat patient low dose heparin low molecular weight heparin DVT prophylaxis treatment bevacizumab may increase risk bleeding . Patients administer aspirin risk bleed stomach ulcer . Prior use chemotherapy . Patients receive immunotherapy , hormonaltherapy radiotherapy within 2 week prior enter study . Note : Those recovered adverse event due agent administer consider ineligible . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients uncontrolled brain metastasis . Note : Patients brain metastasis must stable neurologic status follow local therapy ( surgery radiation ) least 2 week , must without neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition thalidomide、gefitinib aspirin agent use study exclude . Women pregnant breastfeed Note : Pregnant woman exclude study agent use study may teratogenic fetus . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother thalidomide , breastfeed woman also exclude study . HIVpositive Patients combination antiretroviral therapy due potential lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy .</criteria>
