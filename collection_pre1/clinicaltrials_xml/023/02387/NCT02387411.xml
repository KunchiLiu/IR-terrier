	<brief_summary>Chronic heart failure ( CHF ) clinical syndrome present central , cardiac deterioration well peripheral vascular muscular abnormality , result finally reduce exercise tolerance , quality life mortality rate . Exercise training major component rehabilitation / secondary prevention intervention , induce significant beneficial change mechanisms pathophysiology , exercise tolerance , functional capacity quality life , positive impact hospitalization mortality reduction also exclude . There grow interest characteristic modality exercise train able induce optimal benefit . High intensity interval mode show induce great benefit moderate intensity continuous mode regime . Additionally , sound rationale inclusion strength training , also show able yield benefit term exercise capacity quality life . However , n't much data call combined regime , include aerobic exercise strength training . This study aim investigate effect combine high-intensity interval strength training compare high-intensity interval exercise alone CHF .</brief_summary>
