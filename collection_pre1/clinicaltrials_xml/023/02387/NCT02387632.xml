	<brief_summary>Humidified High Flow Nasal Cannula ( HHFNC ) new modality respiratory support child respiratory failure . Despite extensive use pediatric adult population , exact mechanism work HHFNC fully explained.The objective investigator ' research project determine relationship amount airway pressure deliver specific flow level HHFNC . This information allow investigator use HHFNC much inform safe manner .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Airway Pressure During Humidified High Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Respiratory failure one common reason admission Pediatric Critical Care Unit ( PCCU ) . 17 % child admit PCCU require form invasive non-invasive mechanical respiratory support . HHFNC therapy first introduce early 2000 hence relatively new mode respiratory support . One propose mechanism action HHFNC provide airway positive pressure hence consider non-invasive mode ventilation pediatrics . However , actual amount positive airway pressure HHFNC provide increase flow rate well studied child . Objectives : The investigator ' objective measure positive airway pressure deliver increase HHFNC flow rate child , evaluate variable may influence delivery positive airway pressure HHFNC . Methods &amp; Design : This observational cohort study conduct McMaster child ` hospital , pediatric critical care unit ( PCCU ) . Children 18 year age , admit PCCU , require respiratory support HHFNC , determine care physician ; inform consent assent substitute decision maker . Those child must NG tube size 10 French small inserted time HHFNC application . Patients intermittent NGT suction exclude . Airway pressure measure indirectly use esophageal pressure liquid fill method . Data Analysis Baseline demographic summarize use count ( % ) categorical variable , mean ( standard deviation ) median interquartile range ( IQR ) appropriate continuous variable . Estimates pressure report mean ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] ) . Relationship pressure deliver flow analyse use analysis variance . Regression method use determine follow factor deliver flow per weight patient , patient size , disease severity , work breathe nasal cannula : naris diameter ratio associate air pressure</detailed_description>
