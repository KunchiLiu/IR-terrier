	<brief_title>LUDEC Study - Pilot Study Lavage Uterine Cavity Diagnosis Endometrial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endometrial Carcinoma ( EC ) - carcinoma line uterus - common gynecologic malignancy western civilized country . Just US , approximately 42,160 case diagnose 7,780 death occur annually . Type I EC estrogen-dependent associate condition elevate estrogen level . The precursor lesion , atypical endometrial hyperplasia , well describe . Type I EC , often endometroid histology , well differentiated case , usually diagnose early stage due irregular bleeding therefore good prognosis . Type II EC estrogen-dependent serous clear cell histology . In contrast type I cancer , vast majority , especially serous cancer , high grade , affect postmenopausal woman , cause early symptom , diagnose advanced stage , behave like epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC ) poor prognosis . Precursor lesion endometrium refer `` serous endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma '' ( SEIC ) , lesions quite similar precursor lesion EOC fallopian tube , call `` serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma '' ( STIC ) . Unfortunately , patient type II epithelial EC , particular serous clear cell carcinoma , experience symptom disease metastasize . The lack early symptom absence reliable screen test detect disease early , result woman diagnose disease spread beyond uterus therefore poor prognosis . For reason , clear medical need earlier diagnosis type II EC . Type I type II uterine tumor also appear different pattern molecular alteration underlie pathogenesis and/or progression ( 1 ) . Alterations tumor suppressor gene PTEN , microsatellite instability , K-ras alteration associate early development type I tumor , alteration uncommon type II cancer . On hand , mutation TP53 gene appear important early pathogenesis uterine serous carcinoma . Moreover , HER2 overexpression/amplification associate type II tumor . Irregular bleed main symptom EC conventionally investigate `` dilation curettage '' hysteroscopy , rather invasive procedure require general anesthesia hospital admission . This allow diagnosis early stage type I usually endometroid carcinoma . Bleeding serous type II EC examine way , usually , disease already progress advanced stage time diagnosis . The proof concept malignant cell upper genital tract get transport even low genital tract recently publish Kinde I. et al . ( 2 ) . Liquid-based cervical cytology allow cytological evaluation also collection DNA . A panel gene commonly mutate endometrial ovarian cancer assemble new whole-exome sequencing data 22 endometrial cancer previously publish data tumor type , include mutation TP53 gene . This panel use search mutation 24 endometrial 22 ovarian cancer identify mutation 46 sample . Aiming establish possible screen test EOC EC , tumor cell search DNA obtain liquid Pap smear . With sensitive massively parallel sequence method , possible identify mutation DNA liquid Pap smear specimens 100 % endometrial cancer ( 24 24 ) 41 % ovarian cancer ( 9 22 ) . A promising approach detection EOC establish Paul Speiser Robert Zeillinger ( Molecular Oncology Group , Department General Gynaecology Gynaecologic Oncology , Medical University Vienna , Austria ) . This approach call ALPINE technique ( Austrian Lavage Procedure Detection tubal Intraepithelial Neoplasms ) ( manuscript preparation ) . It include lavage uterine cavity proximal fallopian tube subsequent analysis lavage fluid presence pre-malignant malignant cell . Uterine lavages collect surgical intervention suspect ovarian malignancy investigator ' institution . After malignancy confirm , panel genetic change frequently find endometrial ovarian cancer ( see ) study lavage sample 22 ovarian carcinoma patient deep sequence group Bert Vogelstein ( Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , USA ) . The presence genetic change , indicative ovarian cancer , could confirm 16/22 ( ~73 % ) lavage specimen . The sensitivity detect EOC pilot study unprecedented sparked study , examine potential ALPINE technique detect EOC precursor lesion EOC , call STIC . The fact ovarian cancer cell - collect ALPINE technique - detect much high sensitivity lavage , compare liquid-based cervical cytology , make investigator confident EC detection lavage specimen also possible . If turn already SEICs detect lavage specimen , could even result prevention type II EC . The investigator study 80 lavage sample correspond EC tissue sample woman undergo `` dilation curettage '' hysteroscopy abnormal uterine bleeding suspect EC . Women diagnose EC schedule hysterectomy also include study . Patients recruit study 40 case verify ECs correspond lavage collect . Before `` dilation curettage '' hysteroscopy abnormal uterine bleed hysterectomy EC , lavage uterine cavity proximal fallopian tube obtain . The lavage perform operating theatre general anesthesia . After lavage finish , cap put collection syringe syringe send laboratory . The 10ml uterine aspirate centrifuge 10 minute 300 x g. The supernatant remain cell pellet frozen -80Â°C . Analysis cell pellet carry apply sensitive massively parallel sequence method publish Kinde et al . ( 2 ) . Mutations follow gene analyse : AKT1 , APC , BRAF , CTNNB1 , EGFR , FBXW7 , KRAS , NRAS , PTEN , PIK3CA , PPP2R1A , TP53 . Considerations safety ethical issue : One concern lavage procedure might tumor cell EC might get washed peritoneal cavity procedure . During hysteroscopy , distention medium drain tubes peritoneal cavity large quantity . A meta-analysis observational study report significant difference frequency positive peritoneal cytology woman EC undergone diagnostic hysteroscopy ( 3 ) . This indicate transport EC cell uterine cavity peritoneal cavity diagnostic hysteroscopy necessarily result implantation persistence . In study report long-term follow-up , detriment survival associate pre-staging hysterosalpingography ( confirm intraperitoneal spill ) ( 4 ) hysteroscopy ( 5 ) . These finding reassure lavage uterine cavity proximal tube ALPINE technique safe . Conclusion : If possible detect EC high sensitivity specifisity mutation analysis lavage uterine cavity fallopian tube , result represent important finding might open opportunity early detection EC , possibly result stage shift earlier stage . That would lead improvement prognosis , even type II EC . Literature : 1 . Lax SF Molecular genetic pathway various type endometrial carcinoma : phenotypical molecular-based classification .
