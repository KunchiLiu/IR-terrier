	<brief_title>PK Safety Study AG-221 Healthy Male Japanese Subjects Healthy Male Caucasian Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1 , single ascend dose study evaluate PK safety AG-221 healthy adult male Japanese subject relative healthy adult male Caucasian subject . A total 60 subject enrol ; 30 Japanese subject 30 Caucasian subject . There total 3 cohort . Cohort A receive single dose 100 mg AG-221 . Cohort B receive single dose 50 mg AG-221 . Cohort C receive single dose 300 mg AG-221 . Within cohort , 10 subject Japanese 10 subject Caucasian . Investigational product ( IP ) administer orally approximately 240 mL noncarbonated , room-temperature water . Subjects enter clinic prior even meal day dose ( Day -1 ) take single oral dose AG-221 Hour 0 dose day ( Day 1 ) , follow 10 hour overnight fast . After dose administer , subject observe 7 day assess acute safety profile next high , protocol specify dose cohort enroll . The Sponsor Investigator review available safety information prior escalation next cohort ensure safety issue exist . Subjects confine study center Day -1 Day 3 . Subjects discharge study center upon completion 48 hour PK blood draw . Subjects return study center additional PK blood draw Days 5 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 22 29 . In event subject discontinues study , early termination visit perform . Blood sample collect following time ( hour ) analysis AG-221 AGI-16903 ( minor , active metabolite human ) concentration : Pre-dose , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 48 , 96 , 168 , 240 , 336 , 504 672 hour . In accordance guidance clinical pharmacokinetic study Japan , study design select obtain PK data Japanese comparison Caucasian healthy subject . As IP anticancer agent , follow Japanese guidance global study , single dose design choose . AG-221 novel , first-in-class compound target specifically inhibit mutate IDH2 enzyme . AG-221 currently study Phase 1 dose escalation study subject advance hematologic malignancy harbor IDH2 mutation ( AG221-C-001 ) . The AG221-C-001 study currently conduct United States France . This Japanese PK bridging study intend provide single dose PK safety information healthy Japanese subject , relative healthy Caucasian</detailed_description>
