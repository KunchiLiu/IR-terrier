	<brief_summary>The purpose study ( 1 ) determine threshold discriminate speed peripheral field patient dry AMD ( 2 ) examine drive skill license driver early dry AMD use drive simulator investigate healthy counterpart perform drive task . We hypothesize speed discrimination may better patient dry AMD healthy control subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Ocular Diseases Driving : Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational study two goal : 1. establish patient affected dry AMD different speed discriminate threshold use peripheral vision field healthy counterpart . 2. determine drive skill AMD glaucoma patient differ healthy control . Two task use : 1 ) A speed discrimination test . ( Glaucoma patient ask perform task assess peripheral visual field , affect disease . ) 2 ) A driving simulation session . Participant undergo test day , later month initial recruitement visit . For disease , patient compare healthy control match age gender , also young control group . The latter group add order take account normal age impact drive skill ( visual cognitive ) . Our hypothesis AMD patient show well speed discriminate threshold match control maybe well equal young control group . We also hypothesize drive skill involve peripheric speed awareness , pass another car , enhance AMD group compare glaucoma patient age-matched control group .</detailed_description>
