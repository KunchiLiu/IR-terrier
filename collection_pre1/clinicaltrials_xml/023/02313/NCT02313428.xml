	<brief_summary>This study observe effect application topically administer oxygen heal rate , cost care rate amputation diabetic patient foot ulcer ( ) ( DFU ) . The propose study pragmatic ( comparative effectiveness research , CER ) study , effectiveness topical oxygen ( 100 % ) administer 4 day per week , 16 week , treatment diabetic foot ulcer ( DFU ) measure compare standard care ( SoC ) treatment . There 2 patient group ( include comparison group treatment group ) include : ( 1 ) Medicaid patient Wagner grade 2 , receive standard treatment ( 2 ) Medicaid patient Wagner grade 2 , receive standard treatment plus Topical Oxygen Therapy . All Topical Oxygen Therapy provide home care set extend care facility.100 patient recruit . This study assist Ohio Department Medicaid ( ODM ) provide efficient effective administration Medicaid program . This observational descriptive study seek generate hypothesis . Due small sample size study primarily feasibility study attempt measure evaluate difference relative cost intervention topical oxygen therapy population subsequently compare outcome area overall health improvement cost effectiveness .

	<detailed_description>There total 5 study visit include initial baseline visit randomize one 2 group ( comparison treatment ) . At baseline visit follow collect ; history patient , physical examination patient include : , digital imaging DFU input WoundMatrixâ„¢ software , patient ask complete quality life questionnaire . They also provide teach regard diabetes , footwear , wound care . Patients return study visit 2-5 week 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 . At study visit 2-5 research staff collect digital imaging ulcer study visit 5 patient ask complete quality life questionnaire . These visit correlate regular scheduled visit CWC . If ulcer heals end study , ask return study visit 5 ( week 16 ) . The patient complete home treatment , include 90 minute treatment , 4 consecutive day week , 3 day treatment ) . The patient study personnel come home provide supply , teach , give support TO device . The study personnel also go patient 's home weekly give support treatment . Participation study expect add additional risk patient . The risk expect occur frequency irritation skin upper calf . This issue anticipate protocol , specifies appropriate treatment modification discontinuation Topical Oxygen , problem improve . This problem , occurs , expect self-limited minor significance . Oxygen although combustible , support combustion flammable material . The use oxygen protocol essentially equivalent supply nasal cannula patient hospital home . To minimize risk fire investigator strictly enforce smoke open flame policy room Topical Oxygen utilized . Treatment facility comply local fire ordinance study personnel familiar fire safety protocols facility . The potential benefit however dramatic . The disease state highly morbid typically involve prolonged medical care multiple surgical procedure . Despite intensive therapeutic intervention state art still result high morbidity mortality high financial cost . The application topical oxygen diabetic wound potential dramatically impact effectiveness wound heal therefore improve limb salvage , decrease infection rate mortality , generally improve quality life study participant receive topical oxygen well general population efficacy prove . Patients enrol comparison group benefit close follow-up treatment use accept comprehensive wound care protocol .</detailed_description>
