	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , open-label , parallel-group , single-dose study lofexidine 8 adult subject ESRD maintain hemodialysis ( 3 time per week ) 8 control subject normal renal function ( creatinine [ Cr ] clearance &gt; 90 mL/min ) , recruit 1:1 match ESRD subject , match gender , age ( ±10 year ) , body mass index ( BMI ) ( ±15 % ) . Normal renal function ESRD subject confine inpatient facility day dose 144 156 hour dose , respectively , total 7 8 night 8-9 day inpatient confinement . Subjects successfully complete screen report inpatient facility appropriate time day study drug administration undergo pre-dosing study procedure ( Day 1 ) . The next morning ( Day 1 ) , subject receive breakfast ( approximately 6 hour plan lofexidine dose ) ESRD subject begin hemodialysis session . All subject receive single , oral dose 400 µg lofexidine HCl ( two 200 µg tablet ) , dose 240 mL water , clock time approximately normal renal function subject ESRD subject . Because ESRD subject maintain 3 time per week dialysis , lofexidine administer near begin 3-day between-dialysis interval . Fingerprick blood sample subject normal renal function collect PK analysis multiple time point next 144 hour . Fingerprick blood sample ESRD subject collect PK analysis multiple time point next 156 hour . Fingerprick blood sample ( 0.5 mL ) collect BD Microtainer pink top K2EDTA tube . Two ( 2 ) venous blood sample ( 4-6 mL K2EDTA tube ) collect subject lofexidine protein bind analysis , one sample collect 0-60 minute dose one sample collect 4 hour post-dose . Pooled urine sample subject normal renal function collect 0 3 hour , 3 6 hour , 6 12 hour , 12 24 hour , 24 48 hour , 48 72 hour , 72 96 hour , 96 144 hour post-dose . Pooled urine sample collect ESRD subject available accord schedule . Arterial venous blood sample arterial-venous ( A-V ) shunt ( 0.5 mL BD Microtainer pink top K2EDTA tube ) PK analysis collect ESRD subject 0.5 , 1.5 , 2.5 , 3.5 hour two 4 hour hemodialysis session . Additionally , fingerprick blood sample ( 0.5 mL ) collect hand contralateral arm use dialysis A V shunt specify time point . Dialysate ESRD subject collect two 4 hour hemodialysis session 0 1 hour , 1 2 hour , 2 3 hour , 3 4 hour . Two 10 mL sample 1-hour pooled dialysate collection aliquoted suitable collection tube . Safety assess record adverse event ( AEs ) , measure vital sign ( blood pressure pulse rate ) clinical laboratory test ( chemistry , hematology , urinalysis ) , record 12 lead safety Holter electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , perform physical exam .</detailed_description>
