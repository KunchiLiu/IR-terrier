	<brief_summary>Obesity medical condition increase risk disease , type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease . Obesity-related risk factor development metabolic disease include unstable glucose level high blood pressure . Dapagliflozin exenatide approve worldwide treatment patient Type 2 Diabetes . Dapagliflozin work lower glucose level inhibit renal reabsorption glucose thereby promote urinary excretion energy loss thereby reduction body fat . Exenatide exhibit many glucose-lowering action naturally occur hormone lead weight loss mainly via reduce energy intake , likely via central effect appetite regulation . The purpose exploratory study investigate combination treatment dapagliflozin exenatide synergistic effect weight loss non-diabetic obese subject . Subjects treat 24 week either active combination treatment placebo ( non-active treatment ) . Neither study personnel subject know treatment give . All subject complete 24-week double-blind study willing eligible offer enter 28-week open-label extension study . All subject enter extension study receive unblinded active study treatment additional 28 week . Thus total treatment period subject enter extension study 52 week .</brief_summary>
