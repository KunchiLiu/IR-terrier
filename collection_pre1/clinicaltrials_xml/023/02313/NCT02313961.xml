	<detailed_description>Ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) lead cause mortality worldwide , account 7 million death per year . ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) account nearly one third acute coronary syndrome . Despite improved STEMI patient care achieve mainly timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) mortality remain unacceptably high , range 6 14 % . High mortality rate may partly ascribe ischemia-reperfusion injury ( IRI ) believe account 40-50 % infarct size . Several pharmacological alternative attempt prevent IRI promise animal experiment nevertheless clinical translation disappoint . On opposite side , ischemic conditioning ( IC ) short cycle ischemia-reperfusion apply , major ischemic event clearly show attenuate IRI various clinical scenario . Moreover , even repeat bout limb ischemia cardioprotective , so-called remote IC ( RIC ) . In 2010 , Bøtker et al . show improved myocardial salvage index assess single photon emission compute tomography 30 day PCI patient randomly assign receive concomitant RIC whereas Rentoukas et al . find high proportion ST-segment resolution adjunctive RIC compare PCI alone , although significant reduction troponin I peak reached statistical significance subgroup undergo RIC morphine therapy combine PCI . More recently , group Bøtker evaluate long-term effect RIC population initially recruit ( 166 patient underwent PCI adjunctive RIC 167 patient simply underwent PCI ) show improved long-term prognosis patient underwent adjunctive RIC regard composite endpoint adverse cardiac cerebrovascular event : all-cause mortality , MI , readmission heart failure ( HF ) , ischaemic stroke/transient ischaemic attack . However , although promising , result inconclusive regard cardiovascular mortality HF development , since study power show difference clinical event . Large scale study address major adverse cardiovascular event warrant . RIC-STEMI single-centre , randomize , control trial ass whether RIC adjunctive therapy primary PCI patient present ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) improve clinical outcome assess death cardiac-cause hospitalization heart failure ( HF ) minimum follow-up period 12 month . After enrollment , participant randomize accord computer-generated randomization schedule , ratio 1:1 RIC intervention , block four individual . RIC begin least 10 min estimate time first balloon inflation maximum duration 30 min . Ischemia induce 3 cycle inflation blood pressure cuff place leave low limb 200 mmHg deflation 0 mmHg another 5 minute . Apart temporary moderate pain treat thigh , RIC show innocuous . All patient receive standard care therapy accord institutional guideline , namely treatment 250 mg aspirin intravenously , 600 mg clopidogrel orally 5000 IU unfractioned heparin intravenously PCI . The choice balloon , stent type PCI procedure well use glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor leave discretion attend physician . Considering STEMI medical emergency , little time available . Eligible patient orally inform ask participate study . Enrollment base witness oral consent acute phase deal full write informed consent obtain . Patients notified enrollment freedom abandon study time without consequence .</detailed_description>
