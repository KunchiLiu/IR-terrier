	<brief_title>The Effect Checklist Quality Education During Insulin Initiation Trained Medical Students</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Diabetes increase worldwide . The International Diabetes Federation estimate currently 382 million person diagnose diabetes . The prevalence expect increase 592 million less 25 year [ 1 ] . This increase disproportional develop world , 80 % affected living low- middle-income country . For example , South Central America , prevalence diabetes estimate increase 60 % next two decade [ 2 ] . Insulin one agent use treatment diabetes mellitus . Diabetes characterized progressive decline beta-cell function insulin secretion . Over time , significant number person diabetes require intensification management , possibly insulin treatment achieve acceptable glycemic control [ 3 ] . Insulin remain old effective treatment hyperglycemia . It also possibly cheap form treatment relative potency , particularly use animal human form . Insulin particularly important treatment option develop world low-income group develop world . In develop world , drug affordability limit international evolution algorithmic individualized approach glycemic management [ 4 , 5 ] . In many country , insulin remain affordable second third line choice treatment , therefore use great frequency . Insulin initiation , however , complex task . To safely initiate insulin , many important aspect patient education must address . Patients must understand technicality draw insulin needle syringe well administer insulin syringe , pen pump . The side effect weight gain hypoglycemia must also understand , include recognition treatment latter . Checklists show increase quality care reduce error [ 6 ] . They reduce cognitive load decision make decrease analytic conscious think [ 7 ] . At basic level , reduce human error provide documented methodological approach complete task . This advantage may useful complex potentially dangerous arena insulin initiation . We seek evaluate teaching intervention insulin initiation , determine whether safety gain additional use checklist . This evaluation do mean patient simulation , allow reliable evaluation [ 8 ] without expose patient risk [ 9 ] . Research hypothesis ( alternate ) : Using checklist insulin initiation , needle syringe , improve patient education safe effective insulin use , thorough undergraduate education . Methods : Trial design ; The study randomize control . Initially , student experience two-hour training session insulin initiation . Within week complete training , ask submit 250 400-word reflective narrative , guide question reflection . Two four week training , student consent participate study randomly assign two study group : control group intervention group . They ask complete simulation exercise insulin initiation , ( intervention group ) without ( control group ) availability insulin initiation checklist . Performance simulation assess aid check sheet . The Checklist ; The checklist develop task-force , consist eleven individual : layperson , pharmacist , two dietitian , two diabetes educator , podiatrist , diabetes specialist nurse , pediatrician two diabetologists . The process lead pharmacist , diabetes specialist nurse one diabetologists . The final version checklist achieve iterative cycle re-design feedback . The aim develop simple A4-size , two-sided document could easily copy . Eleven checklist item agree upon , cover insulin side effect ; use disposal syrinx ; insulin administration storage ; recognition treatment hypoglycemia . Images illustrate process use syringe draw insulin vial well injection site ( child , adult pregnant woman ) include back . There also space provide documentation client 's name registration number , insulin type take , medication stop , date signature facilitator . The Check Sheet ; A check sheet use evaluate performance undergraduate student simulation . Educational task list five sub-headings : 'side effect ' , 'hypoglycemia ' , 'drawing insulin ' , 'insulin administration ' , 'other ' . Tick box use 'check ' whether task perform adequately , inadequately . Each task brief note constitutes adequate performance . Setting Simulation ; The study take place within nine-week final year medicine clerkship University West Indies , Cave Hill , Barbados . Every nine week , simulation take place within medicine end-of-clerkship Objective Structured Clinical Examination . An actor/actress use simulation play role patient , he/she require education use administration insulin via needle syringe . The participant give instruction simulation use checklist , intervention group . Training session insulin initiation ; Key aspects lesson plan outline : Time : 120 minute Number student : 7 10 Materials : - Insulin bottle - At least 7 insulin syrinx - An orange suitable model inject - 7 10 insulin initiation checklists - 7 10 instruction sheet simulation section F - Sharps disposal container Aim : To able competently initiate insulin client diabetes Outcomes : Ability , 1 . Evaluate client determine whether insulin initiation appropriate 2 . Evaluate client decide insulin initiate titrate 3 . Discuss major side effect insulin use , include weight gain hypoglycemia 4 . Discuss frequency time glucose monitoring insulin regime ( background , biphasic basal bolus ) 5 . Explain client recognize treat hypoglycemia 6 . Demonstrate explain client proper technique draw inject insulin , use needle syringe well pen Learning method : - Case base approach - Socratic discussion - Use simulation create clinically authentic learn environment - Kolb 's experiential reflective cycle - Utilization checklist structure learn Session structure : A : ( 10 minute ) Brief review insulin type B : ( 30 minute - 10 minute per case ) Discussion three clinical case scenario , decide : 1. whether insulin initiation appropriate regime use , 2. frequency glucose monitoring , 3. approach initiation titration insulin , applicable General learning point section Indications insulin : - Type-1 diabetes - Diabetes due pancreatic insufficiency - Type-2 diabetes adequately control oral agent ( second-line third-line agent ) insulin safely introduce Weight gain insulin approximately 2 4 kg proportional glucose lower . It likely due reduction glycosuria . C : ( 15 minute ) Students discuss key element education client learn draw self-administer insulin , use needle syringe . D : ( 10 minute ) Simulation- student demonstrate would educate client start insulin use needle syringe . Instructions give student : please start patient 10 unit Novolin N bedtime ; administration needle syringe method ; , please provide education require . A diabetes specialist nurse ( DSN ) act simulated client . Other student observe reflect would . E : ( 30 minute ) Insulin initiation taught DSN , use structure checklist . Methods administration include syringe pen . F : ( 30 minute - Role change 15 minute ) Simulation- Students work pairs , one act patient one doctor , simulate education require insulin initiation . `` Doctors '' instruction use checklist process initiation . Insulin initiation reflective narrative : Instructions student ; Having experience insulin initiation session require write short , 250-400 word reflective narrative . The desired outcome process enhancement understand learnt , knowledge skill need facilitate learn . Please consider guide question assist process . 1 . How session impact knowledge skill insulin initiation ? 2 . What action enable provide best quality care insulin initiation ? 3 . What make session useful learn experience ? Please note submission adequate piece essential part educational intervention assess presence content related question . Evaluation : The educational intervention evaluate 2 4 level Kirkpatrick evaluation model 10 . On level one , content analysis reflective narrative provide information like intervention . On level two , student 's performance simulation insulin initiation provide information learnt . Additionally , comparison student initiate insulin without ( control group ) checklist give insight safety gain use . Analysis : Reflective commentary analyze qualitatively use Atlas ti V7 software . Code list creation inductive ( code formulate base research question available literature ) deductive ( code base information derive commentary ) . Thematic analysis take place iterative cycle cod , update code analysis . To ensure consistency analytic process , two researcher participate process meet regularly compare analysis within across participant . A third researcher repeat analysis event discrepancy . Quantitative data analyze use SPSS version 18 ( IBM Inc. , Armonk , New York , USA ) . Descriptive statistic use describe performance without checklist . The chi-squared test use analyze nominal data capture without use checklist . If necessary assumption apply t-tests determine whether statistically significant difference within checklist score administration group . If necessary assumption apply Wilcoxon signed-rank test use respectively . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider represent statistical significance .</detailed_description>
