	<brief_title>Endothelial Function-guided Therapy Compared Usual Care Patients With NOCAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects chest pain non-obstructive coronary artery disease ( 20-70 % luminal diameter narrow ) document coronary angiogram enrol study 2 - 30 day follow coronary angiogram . Only subject sign Informed Consent Form meet eligibility criterion qualify enrollment . Following baseline EndoPAT test subject divide two group EndoPAT ( EndoScore ) result : 1 . Group A - normal EndoScore : Logarithmic value RHI ( Ln_RHI ) &gt; 0.7 2 . Group B - abnormal EndoScore : Ln_RHI ≤ 0.7 The subject Group B randomize 1:1 ratio ( envelopes randomization number site ) Group B1 treat conventionally i.e. , `` usual care '' site study team ; Group B2 treat `` enhance care '' . Staff prescribe treatment regime subject group A B1 ( `` usual care '' ) along subject group , blind EndoScore value . Subjects group return 4 follow-up visit : 180±14days , 360±14days , 720±14days 1080±14days ( study end ) .</detailed_description>
