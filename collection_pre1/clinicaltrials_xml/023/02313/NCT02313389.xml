	<brief_summary>Hypothesis Our hypothesis maintenance chemotherapy prolong complete remission obtain standard induction chemotherapy acceptable toxicity elderly . Rationale - Treatment elderly challenging , indeed age 60 associate poor prognosis high risk treatment induced neurotoxicity devastate consequence quality life . Therefore become standard practice treat elderly first line high-dose methotrexate ( MTX ) base polychemotherapy alone , avoid whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) defer recurrence . - There clear need improve disease control induction chemotherapy . Since consolidation WBRT intensive chemotherapy autologous stem cell rescue either poorly effective and/or toxic elderly population , maintenance chemotherapy interest alternative approach . Several agent , high-dose MTX , temozolomide ( TMZ ) , rituximab , report activity PCNSL acceptable safety profile , single agent combine , good candidate maintenance</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives - The primary objective evaluate benefit estimate PFS associate maintenance chemotherapy compare observation patient ≥ 60 year achieve complete response high-dose MTX base induction chemotherapy - The secondary objective ass : - Overall survival - Safety maintenance chemotherapy - Neurocognitive outcome - Quality life patient Inclusion exclusion criterion At registration - Inclusion criterion - Newly diagnose primary cerebral lymphoma - Age &gt; 60 year - Pathology proven diagnosis - Positive cytology CSF vitreous - Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 40 - No evidence systemic NHL ( body CT scan , bone marrow biopsy ) - Adequate haematological , renal hepatic function - Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 40 ml/min - Non inclusion criterion - Positive HIV serology - Preexisting immunodeficiency ( organ transplant recipient ) - Prior treatment PCNSL - Isolated primary intra-ocular lymphoma - Low grade lymphoma - Any active primary malignancy At randomization - Complete response MRI induction chemotherapy accord IPCG criterion - Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 40 - Adequate haematological , renal hepatic function Study Design - This study open label multicenter randomize phase III trial compare maintenance chemotherapy versus observation complete responder high dose MTX base induction chemotherapy . - Patients register participate study time initial diagnosis study enrolment induction chemotherapy . - Induction chemotherapy ( R-MPVA protocol ) include 4 5 monthly cycle high dose MTX ( 3.5g/m2 , D1 D15 ) , procarbazine , vincristine , rituximab follow one cycle high dose cytarabine consolidation . - Randomization observation ( arm 1 ) maintenance ( arm 2 ) carry patient complete response ( CR ) induction chemotherapy Arm 1 : Observation Arm 2 : Seven monthly R-MT cycle include high dose MTX ( 3.5g/m2 , D1 ) , TMZ , rituximab Sample size , duration study , feasibility - 295 patient need enrol randomize 192 patient - Duration study : 6 year ( accrual period= 4 year ; minimal follow-up = 2 year ) 26 participate expert center national LOC network The trial support neurooncology ANOCEF lymphoma LYSA clinical research group . Ancillary study LOCALYSE : Role [ 18F ] -FDG brain PET newly diagnose primary cerebral lymphoma , immunocompetent patient old 60 year Rationale Patients old 60 year account half case PCNSL poorer outcome . No prognostic predictive factor exist survival initial remission . [ 18F ] FDG-PET ( Fluoro Deoxy Glucose ) play key role grade therapy monitoring systemic diffuse large B-cell type . LOCALYZE ancillary PET/MR clinical study BLOCAGE 01 . The aim evaluate usefulness [ 18F ] FDG-PET monitor treatment response PCNSL ( Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma ) old 60 year ( n=56 ) , complement multiparametric MRI . Hypothesis We assume development new image biomarker extract PET image multiparametric MRI , could improve assessment treatment response PCNSL . Primary aim To evaluate predictive value [ 18F ] FDG-PET assessment perform end-of-treatment ( high-dose methotrexate base polychemotherapy ) , progression free survival newly diagnose PCNSL age ≥60 year ( n=56 ) . Primary Outcome Measures : Progression free survival calculate date completion end chemotherapy PET Study design Three [ 18F ] -FDG PET/MR perform Department Nuclear Medicine - Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital : - prior initiation R-MPVA chemotherapy ( Rituximab Methotrexate Procarbazine Vincristine Aracytine ) ( PET # 1 ) , - two chemotherapy cycle ( PET # 2 ) , - end first-line chemotherapy regimen ( PET # 3 ) . Inclusion criterion ( =Blocage-01 ) Blocage01 eligibility Exclusion criterion - Uncontrolled diabetes fast glycaemia &gt; 200 mg/dL - Sensitivity active substance [ 18F ] -FDG - Calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 40 ml/min - No contraindication MRI</detailed_description>
