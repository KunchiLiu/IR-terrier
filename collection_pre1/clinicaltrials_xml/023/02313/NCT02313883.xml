	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy PerioSept® Adjunct SRP Subjects With Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial follow adaptive trial design , whereby information regard PerioSept ( r ) drug level obtain via PK trial lead period ( PK Pilot ) limit number subject ( N=8 ) . This follow main safety efficacy trial PerioSept ( r ) adjunct scale root planing ( SRP ) subject moderate severe periodontitis ( Main Trial , N=87 ) . The PK Pilot open label PK study . Up 8 qualify subject receive SRP Day 1 follow 3 % PerioSept ( r ) administer minimum 4 qualify periodontal Study Pockets least 2 quadrant probe pocket depth ( PPD ) ≥ 5mm bleed probing ( BOP ) least 20 qualify pocket ( PPD ≥ 5 mm ) . The Main Trial multi-center , randomize , blind , placebo control , parallel arm trial PerioSept ( r ) ( 0.3 % , 1 % 3 % ) administer three time ( Days 1 2 , Weeks 4 12 ) minimum 4 qualify periodontal Study Pockets least 2 quadrant PPD ≥ 5mm BOP follow SRP baseline . All eligible pocket PPD ≥ 5mm also treat . Full mouth SRP initiate Day 1 follow randomize treatment side . If necessary , SRP randomize treatment may complete side mouth Day 2 . Treated pocket still PPD ≥ 5mm 4 12 week visit retreat SRP SRP plus placebo PS , randomize . Assessments conduct 24 week ( 6 month ) period include safety assessment assessment dental parameter ( PPD , BOP , Plaque index , Gingival Index , Clinical attachment level ) .</detailed_description>
