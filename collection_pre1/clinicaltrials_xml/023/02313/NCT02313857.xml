	<brief_summary>Patients enrol study receive stem cell transplant . After transplant , immune system grow back patient risk infection . Some virus stay body life , immune system weaken ( like transplant ) , cause life-threatening infection . CMV cause serious infection patient weak suppressed immune system . It usually affect lung , cause serious pneumonia , also affect gut , liver eye . Investigators want see use kind white blood cell call T cell treat CMV infection occur transplant . Investigators observe study treatment specially trained T cell successful cell make transplant donor . However take 1-2 month make cell , approach practical patient already infection . Investigators generate CMV-specific T cell blood healthy donor create bank cell . Investigators previously successfully use frozen virus-specific T cell line generate healthy donor treat virus infection bone marrow transplant , improve production method customize bank line specifically exclusively target CMV . In study , investigator want find banked CMV-specific T cell derive healthy donor safe help treat CMV infection . The CMV-specific T cell ( Viralym-C ) investigational product approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To make CMV-specific T cell ( Viralym-C cell ) , small piece protein call peptide come CMV mixed blood cell healthy donor . These peptide train kind white blood cell call T cell recognize kill cell infected CMV . These T cell grown special growth factor special flasks lab . Once make sufficient number cell , test make sure recognize cell infect CMV , froze . When think subject need , Viralym-C cell thaw injected intravenous line . To prevent allergic reaction , prior receive Viralym-C cell subject may give diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) . The subject remain clinic least one hour infusion . After subject receives cell , transplant doctor monitor level CMV blood . We also take blood see long cell give subject lasting body . Subjects continue follow transplant doctor injection . The subject either see clinic contact research nurse follow study every week 6 week , 3 , 6 12 month . The subject may visit standard care . Subjects also regular blood test do follow count viral infection part standard care . To learn way Viralym-C cell work body , extra 30-40 ml ( 6-8 teaspoon ) blood take infusion study follow-up visit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 6 week , 3 month infusion . Blood come central intravenous line , require extra needle stick . All participant study infused number ( dose ) cell . If Viralym-C infusion help subject infection treatment , example steroid drug might destroy T cell subject give , allow receive 4 additional infusion Viralym-C cell initial dose level 28 day initial infusion . Following infusion least 14 day apart . After Viralym-C cell infusion , subject monitor described .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Prior myeloablative nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant use either bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell single double cord blood within 24 month . 2 . Persistent recurrent cytomegalovirus infection disease despite least 7 day standard therapy failure therapy describe unable tolerate standard therapy . Standard therapy define antiviral therapy ganciclovir CMX001 ( brincidofovir ) agent choice foscarnet cidofovir second line agent . i.Cytomegalovirus infection : define presence CMV positivity detect Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) pp65 antigenemia culture ONE site stool blood urine nasopharynx . ii . Cytomegalovirus disease : define demonstration CMV biopsy specimen visceral site ( culture histology ) detection CMV culture direct fluorescent antibody stain broncheoalveolar lavage fluid presence new change pulmonary infiltrates change consistent CMV retinitis ophthalmologic examination . iii . Failure therapy : define rise fall le 50 % viral load peripheral blood site disease measure PCR pp65 antigenemia 7 day antiviral therapy . 3 . Clinical status enrollment allow taper steroid equal less 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone ( equivalent ) . 4 . Hemoglobin ( HgB ) &gt; 8.0 ( may transfuse ) 5 . Received transplant care locally remain Houston area least 6 week post ViralymC infusion 6 . Pulse oximetry &gt; 90 % room air 7 . Available ViralymC T cell line 8 . Negative pregnancy test female patient applicable ( childbearing potential receive reduced intensity condition regimen ) . 9 . Informed consent explain , understood sign patient/guardian . Patient/guardian give copy inform consent . 1 . Patients receive ( antithymocyte globulin ) ATG , Campath immunosuppressive T cell monoclonal antibody within 28 day treatment ViralymC 2 . Patients uncontrolled/progressing infection define hemodynamic instability attributable sepsis new symptom , worsen physical sign radiographic finding attributable infection . For bacterial infection , patient must receive definitive therapy sign progress infection 72 hour prior enrollment . For fungal infection patient must receive definitive systemic antifungal therapy sign progress infection 1 week prior enrollment . Persisting fever without sign symptom interpret progress infection . 3 . Patients receive donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) within 28 day ViralymC infusion . 4 . Patients receive investigational drug within 28 day ViralymC infusion 5 . Patients active acute Graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) grade IIIV . 6 . Active uncontrolled relapse malignancy</criteria>
