A grow body evidence identify change composition , temporal stability metabolic activity gut microbiome IBS ( Bolino &amp; Bercik , 2010 ) . Moreover , evidence bidirectional communication gut brain , gut microbiota appear influence well modulate brain activity neurohumoral mechanism ( Collins , Surette , &amp; Bercik , 2012 ) . Currently , medication widely use treatment IBS ( Ford et al. , 2009 ; Ford et al. , 2014 ) .
