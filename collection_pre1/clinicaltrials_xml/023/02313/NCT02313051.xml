	<detailed_description>Endocrine therapy cornerstone treatment patient hormone receptor ( HR ) -positive advanced breast cancer . The selection endocrine agent take account menopausal status , type previous adjuvant endocrine treatment , disease free interval past medical history . In premenopausal woman HR-positive advance breast cancer , ovarian function suppression combine aromatase inhibitor standard first-line choice hormone treatment , especially patient progress tamoxifen . Unfortunately , patient response first-line endocrine therapy , even patient response eventually become resistant . An emerge mechanism endocrine resistance aberrant signal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) -Akt-mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) signal pathway7-9 . Growing evidence support close interaction mTOR pathway ER signaling . Everolimus sirolimus derivative inhibits mTORactivation11 . In preclinical model , use everolimus combination aromatase inhibitor result synergistic inhibition proliferation induction apoptosis12 . In randomized , phase 2 study compare neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole letrozole alone patient newly diagnose ER-positive breast cancer , response rate combination high letrozole alone . Recently , Breast Cancer Trials Oral Everolimus-2 ( BOLERO-2 ) study show addition everolimus exemestane significantly improve progression-free survival , observe median 11 4 month , correspond 62 % reduction hazard ratio14 impressive practice change . However , different western country , majority ( 50-55 % ) patient premenopausal woman Asia include China.The benefit everolimus plus endocrine therapy premenopausal woman yet well delineate . Although report efficacy comparable premenopausal metastatic breast cancer patient treat letrozole plus goserelin postmenopausal patient treated letrozole alone first line hormone therapy , generally accept endocrine treatment outcome premenopausal woman , especially young age know poor . So addition everolimusin population would potential viable treatment option overcome resistance endocrine therapy need evaluated . In addition , feasibility patient progress endocrine continue receive endocrine agent plus everolimus unclear . At time , difference concurrent sequential medication endocrine agent everolimus yet address . Based rationale , investigator introduce randomized trial evaluate efficacy addition everolimus letrozole LHRH agonist premenopausal metastatic breast cancer patient fail tamoxifen treatment also explore best schedule endocrine therapy together everolimus .</detailed_description>
