	<brief_summary>Sciatica due herniated disc major cause disability young adult . Surgery gold-standard control treatment case failure conservative treatment . Percutaneous chemonucleolysis Discogel® may valuable alternative surgery . In addition , Discogel® chemonucleolysis appear relatively innocuous technique may avoid 2 % complication disc surgery 5 % repeat surgery ( accord recent trial ) . This first randomize trial compare Discogel® chemonucleolysis versus surgery patient sciatica due lumbar disc herniation unresponsive conservative medical treatment ( include epidural steroid injection ) Our expectation Discogel® chemonucleolysis avoid surgery 80 % patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intradiscal Discogel® Resistant Sciatica</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since chymopapain take market 2002 , percutaneous treatment proven valuable alternative surgical discectomy herniated disk-related sciatica . Intradiscal injection alcohol possibly efficient technique use due rapid dissipation nerve toxicity . The gel , stabilize alcohol disc , make effective locally cancel nerve toxicity . As preliminary evaluation , conduct open trial strict methodological criterion test efficiency intradiscal injection use new product base jellified ethanol , Discogel® , treatment nerve root pain due compression herniated disk . A 30 % improvement pain VAS obtain two third patient . No complication encounter . These result prompt u investigate effectiveness Discogel® chemonucleolysis use randomized design compare surgery remain gold-standard treatment disk-related sciatica resistant conservative treatment . Our hypothesis chemonucleolysis use Discogel® suitable efficacy safety profile large application treatment persistent herniated disc relate sciatica consequently able reduce need surgery , namely open discectomy , indication . New minimally invasive approach herniated disc-related sciatica crucial , due high prevalence medico-economic impact disease . Awaited advance enrichment management strategy herniated disc-related sciatica , early recovery patient unresponsive first line conservative treatment , reduction cost serious adverse event relate surgery finally reduction cost associate induced sciatica disability . Study design : - Open randomize non-inferiority clinical trial - Discogel® v surgery , organize within four next week randomization - Eligible patient decline participation trial follow observational cohort time-frame randomize cohort - Measurement compliance assign treatment - Patients randomize delay decline assign treatment exclude trial - Visits 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 52 week ( evaluation main secondary outcome ) - Result analysis conduct Intention treat - Surgery allow Discogel® arm start 16 W visit case intractable pain complication . Study procedure : Enrollment patient do consultation Rheumatology , Radiology , Surgery Physical Rehabilitation Medicine Departments study center . Indeed , inclusion visit do physician perform chemonucleolysis , surgeon charge patient . After randomization , chemonucleolysis surgery schedule within four next week . Patients undergoing chemonucleolysis hospitalize day hospital Rheumatology / Surgery department study center . The procedure chemonucleolysis perform correspond Radiology department usual department . Open discectomy perform conventional hospitalization Surgery department study center . Duration hospital stay depend patient 's recovery surgery . A duration one week expect . The follow-up patient 52 week ( 5 time point ) . At time point , main secondary outcome evaluate . Questionnaires fill patient , consultation visit . An independent person ( nurse , secretary , clinical research technician.. ) available help patient fill self questionnaire check accuracy patient answer . It important note physician involve protocol participate patient evaluation . The physician assessor blind result questionnaire .</detailed_description>
