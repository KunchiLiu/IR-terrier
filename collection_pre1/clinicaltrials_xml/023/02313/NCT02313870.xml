	<brief_title>Topical Steroids Alone Associated With Methotrexate Bullous Pemphigoid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bullous pemphigoid ( BP ) rare mucocutaneous autoimmune bullous disorder ( incidence &lt; 1/10000 / year France ) mostly affect elderly patient . Its mortality rate high 20 40 % one year . A study initiated French group bulllous disorder devote study autoimmune bullous disease study autoimmune bullous disease international leader issue , previously demonstrate efficacy relatively good tolerance superpotent topical corticosteroid BP.However , use superpotent topical corticosteroid flaw practical difficulty ( home-based care nurse twice day administer treatment , several month ) cost significantly high oral steroid treatment consequence . On hand , probably non-negligible systemic absorption superpotent topicalsteroid responsible potentially serious side effect similar encounter systemic corticosteroid . Finally , protract treatment superpotent topical steroid often cause skin atrophy deleterious consequences.It would interest able significantly reduce duration use topical steroid early-associated systemic treatment rely easy-to-use relatively safe molecule would maintain disease control initial clinical remission achieve initial time-limited use superpotent topical steroid . Methotrexate ( MTX ) could interesting candidate regard , low-level tolerable short- middle-term toxicity small dos use ( 10-15 mg / week ) long-term safety usually irrelevant elderly patient . Its use monitoring relatively easy number international publication , include two recent French one , show efficacy set include relay strategy initial use superpotent topical steroid BP treatment , preliminary open study .These encouraging result prompt propose control multi-center randomized clinical trial , direct individual benefit , compare efficacy safety treatment regimen use superpotent topical steroid alone maintain 9 month ( current standard care ) mix initial treatment combine application superpotent topical steroid associate methotrexate 4 week follow methotrexate alone 8 additional month non-localized BP . In arm , total treatment duration 9 month . The two arm study : Arm A : daily application topical clobetasol propionate dose 10 30 g / day depend patient 's weight initial number new blister per day , associate methotrexate ( MTX ) receive either orally subcutaneously dose 12.5 mg / week patient weigh less 60 kg creatinine clearance great 50 ml / min ( plan dose reduction 10 mg / week patient le 60 kg creatinine clearance le 50 ml / min ) four week follow oral subcutaneous methotrexate alone dose follow 8 monthsArm B : daily application topical clobetasol propionate dose 10 30 g / day depend patient 's weight initial number new blister per day maintain 14 day full disease control follow daily dose applied every day month twice week month week end 9th month.The primary endpoint actuarial survival rate one year group secondary endpoint initial control rate disease , number serious side effect treatment number relapse treatment.The expect result equivalence two compare strategy term safety efficacy , MTX monotherapy maintenance phase easy manage therefore associate good compliance topical steroid less cutaneous side effect cost-effective.This study enroll 150 patient per arm include follow 9 month 9 visit per patient .</detailed_description>
