	<brief_summary>The F.R.O.N.T . formula pre-operative airway assessment documentation Background : Prediction difficult airway one important challenge general anesthesia . Although recent decade different score system preoperative assessment sensitivity specificity predict difficult airway remain moderate . Recently , calculation composite score use different formula propose sensitive one . The aim present work test clinical usefulness FRONT score , recently develop score system . Methods : This study multi-center , inter-observer , prospective double-blind investigation include 976 patient two university center : 250 University Cluj-Napoca , Romania , 726 University Debrecen , Hungary . The preoperative evaluation patient perform preoperative team anesthesiologist ( team A ) evaluate score expect difficulty management airway . An intraoperative team evaluator ( team B ) work independently team A , perform actual instrumentation airway score actual finding . Both team use FRONT score system work independently ensure blinded assessment . Statistical analysis preoperative intraoperative FRONT score perform post hoc .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Criteria preoperative assessment grade five level `` F '' 0 Normal level difficulty difficulty expect 1 . Difficulty apply air tight facial mask ventilation one person ( difficulty maintain SpO2 92 % 100 % O2 ) , inability prevent decrease SpO2 facial mask ventilation . 2 . Increased ventilation difficulty , require presence two anesthetist order maintain patient 's oxygenation , inability ventilate patient facial mask . `` R '' 0 Normal level difficulty difficulty expect 1 . Incomplete teeth , loose teeth , edentulous status , incisor protrusion , prognathia , micrognathia , limited opening mouth still 3 cm. , expect difficulty direct laringoscopy and/or insertion supraglottic device . 2 . Mobile teeth , mouth open less 3 cm , laryngoscopy insertion supraglottic airway device impossible `` O '' 0 Normal level difficulty difficulty expect 1 Laryngoscopy intubation difficult expect intaroral mass , abscess , anatomical anomaly ( large tongue ) 2 Laryngoscopy tracheal intubation expect extremely difficult impossible `` N '' 0 Normal level difficulty difficulty expect 1 . Reduced mobility cervical spine , short neck , bulky chest , special position patient necessary ( roll shoulder ) 2 . Immobile cervical spine `` T '' 0 Normal level difficulty difficulty expect 1 . Expected trouble pass tube glottis ( polyp , tumor , abscess ) , tube small diameter necessary 2 . Severe obstruction upper airway ( polyp , tumor , abscess , paralysis vocal cord ) , tracheal stenosis , tracheomalacia Criteria intraoperative assessment grade five level . `` F '' 0 Normal level difficulty difficulty 1 . Difficulty seal face mask accordingly one person order maintain SpO2 92 % ventilate oxygen . 2 . Inability maintain SpO2 92 % ventilate oxygen handle face mask two person . `` R '' 0 Normal level difficulty difficulty 1 . Incomplete dentition , protrude incisives , prognathia , micrognathia , reduce interincisive gap 3 cm thus explicitly hamper ( completely prevent ) intubation supraglottic device insertion . 2 . Incomplete dentition , protrude incisives , prognathia , micrognathia , reduce interincisive gap 3 cm limit intubation supraglottic device insertion . `` O '' 0 Normal level difficulty difficulty 1 . Macroglossia , presence tumour finding increase oral tissue mass , tongue base process hamper performance direct laryngoscopy ( Cormack/Lehane grade 3° ) , conventional intubation insertion supraglottic airway . Final success could achieve two attempt secure airway adopt technique . 2 . Macroglossia , presence tumour finding increase oral tissue mass , tongue base process prevent performance direct laryngoscopy ( Cormack/Lehane grade 4° ) , conventional intubation insertion supraglottic airway . Tracheal intubation could achieve recur visualize technique ( e.g . flexible fiberoptic ) . `` N '' 0 Normal level difficulty difficulty 1 . Reduced cervical spine mobility , short neck , risk spinal cord damage certain head position hamper direct laryngoscopy conventional mean tracheal intubation . Successful intubation possible 2 attempt . Supraglottic airway insertion affect . 2 . Reduced cervical spine mobility , short neck , risk spinal cord damage certain head position prevent direct laryngoscopy conventional mean tracheal intubation . Tracheal intubation could achieve recur visualize technique ( e.g . flexible fiberoptic ) . Supraglottic airway insertion may affect . `` T '' 0 Normal level difficulty difficulty 1 . Difficult forward tracheal tube regular diameter mid-tracheal position . Supraglottic airway insertion affect . 2 . Impossible forward tracheal tube even reduce diameter mid-tracheal position . Supraglottic airway insertion affect ventilation difficult impossible . Necessity apply jet ventilation bypass oro-tracheal route perform trans-tracheal access .</detailed_description>
