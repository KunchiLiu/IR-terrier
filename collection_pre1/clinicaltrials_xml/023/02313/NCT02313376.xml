	<detailed_description>This single arm , open-label , phase 1 safety study design evaluate safety tolerability genetically attenuate P. falciparum ( GAP3KO ) arrest early liver stage parasite life cycle . The study also confirm attenuation GAP3KO parasites use peripheral blood smear . The secondary objective study evaluate humoral immune response GAP3KO . A total 10 healthy , malaria-na√Øve adult subject enrol receive GAP3KO via bite 150-200 GAP3K0-infected A. stephensi mosquito control condition . Subjects evaluate safety , reactogenicity , sign symptom malaria confirm attenuation 28 day , include monitor hotel set 8-18 day post GAP 3KO administration .</detailed_description>
