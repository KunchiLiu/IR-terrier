	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize single-cell analysis use evaluate prostate needle-core biopsy prospectively even non-homogenous sample provide profile proteomic phenotypic signature . These profile turn enable good prediction malignant progression prostate cancer settings current clinical practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current approach early detection diagnosis include prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) useful , though specific , biomarker detect prostate cancer . The suspected patient send digital rectal examination ( DRE ) , doctor insert lubricate , gloved finger patient 's rectum feel lump , enlargement , area hardness might indicate prostate cancer . However , test fully confirm diagnosis prostate cancer biopsy - removal small piece prostate microscopic examination . If cancer suspect use PSA test DRE , 90 % suspected patient choose undergo prostate biopsy . Prostate needle biopsy routinely do outpatient basis rarely require hospitalization . Markedly , fine needle biopsy minimally invasive currently suggest longitudinal monitoring highly suspected patient follow-up therapeutic response . The large availability biopsy sample prostate cancer provide cornerstone propose patient specimen-based research . The investigator anticipate comprehensive analysis rather simple pathological examination sample generate new insight prostate tumor progression human .</detailed_description>
