	<detailed_description>Major colorectal surgery , i.e . surgery involve wide colon resection and/or low anastomosis , remain problematic , despite great advance medico-pharmaceutical treatment , improvement surgical technique , sophisticated postoperative management . Such surgery still accompany unacceptably high morbidity 15 % 23.2 % leading increase number ventilatory support day , prolongation total hospital stay , significantly high medical cost , patient suffering , , unfortunately mortality . Worse , nowadays , infection sepsis far common morbidity , either initial cause consequence another complication , anastomotic leakage . Ongoing clinical study report probiotic therapy beneficial elective surgery case , since show successfully modulate GI flora plethora medical setting critically ill trauma patient . More precisely , recent randomize controlled study meta-analyses elective surgery abdominal surgery patient demonstrate perioperative use probiotic safe reduces incidence postoperative wound infection , sepsis , post-operative pneumonia infection , necessary duration hospital stay length antibiotic therapy . However , exist control , large-scale , trial compare current standard treatment probiotic concept show superiority latter colonic surgery regard reduce complication rate . Therefore , investigator decide conduct randomize control trial investigate impact probiotic treatment protocol postoperative morbidity open elective colonic surgery cohort . The major objective evidence reduction 30-day infectious , surgery-related morbidity : surgical site infection ; organ specific infection ; systemic infection anastomotic leakage . Minor objective related reduction non-infectious complication , well assessment outcome indicator number day postoperative ileus , mechanical ventilation , stay ICU , total hospitalization mortality 30-day post-operative period .</detailed_description>
