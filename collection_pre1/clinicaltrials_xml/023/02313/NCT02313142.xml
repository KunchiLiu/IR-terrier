	<brief_summary>One major issue space exploration negative effect prolong exposure low gravity ( i.e . condition often refer microgravity weightlessness ) astronauts ' health . In unusual condition human body undergoes adaptation process , often refer `` deconditioning '' , lead significant loss bone muscle mass , hormonal change , well modification important cardiovascular parameter . While new physiological state adequate microgravity environment , result unsuitable upon return earth . Hence mission astronaut experience various health-related problem must undertake intense rehabilitation program . Cardiovascular deconditioning originates mainly shift blood low extremity upper part body cause absence gravity . In long term ( i.e . day ) cause loss blood body fluid . In short term ( i.e . minute ) elicit modification arterial blood pressure heart rate . In study , fund European Union project STAMAS , intend evaluate whether leg physical exercise lead displacement blood towards low extremity , therefore ameliorate upward fluid shift cause weightlessness . More generally , aim investigate short-term response cardiovascular system leg exercise microgravity-like condition . After clear understanding phenomenon develop controller , monitor physiological stare subject , compute appropriate exercise regime stabilize his/her cardiovascular parameter desire safe value . Our contribution provide good understand cardiovascular system , delineate physiological ground development novel countermeasure device cardiovascular deconditioning space flight base continuous leg exercise . The protocol propose document present minimal risk potential subject , potential produce important contribution . The cardiovascular parameter intend analyse : blood pressure , heart rate leg blood volume . These signal acquire non-invasively minimal risk . Leg exercise perform mean step device ( MARCOS ) previously develop Lab . MARCOS enable vary resistance apply knee-extension movement , therefore allow systematic evaluation different exercise intensity . Finally , microgravity condition easily emulate let subject lay tilted platform head-down ( i.e . head-down bed rest - HDBR , head-down tilt - HDT ) exercise session , thus induce shift body fluid toward thorax . The effective inclination angle prove low -6Â° , thus constitute minimal risk subject . In practice , subject comfortably lay negatively tilted platform perform step different intensity cardiovascular parameter monitor record encrypted form subsequent analysis .</brief_summary>
