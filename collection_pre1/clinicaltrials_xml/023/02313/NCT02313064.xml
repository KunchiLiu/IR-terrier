	<detailed_description>This first-in-human ( FIH ) study oral formulation CXA-10 . The main purpose trial demonstrate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics ( PK ) CXA-10 metabolite ( ) administer single ascend oral dos healthy volunteer ( Part A ) . The effect food PK CXA-10 also investigate ( Part B ) . Part A study single-center , randomize , double-blind , third party open ( sponsor ) placebo-controlled study . Sequential single ascending dos administer 5 cohort subject . Each cohort subject randomize receive single dose CXA-10 placebo , fast state , illustrate table . Part B study single-center , open-label , two-period study conduct two cohort subject follow . The select dose interval Period 1 Period 2 determine base emerge PK data Part A . The select dose intermediate dose level avoid food effect interaction markedly enhance exposure . Subjects participate Part B study receive two dos CXA-10 .</detailed_description>
