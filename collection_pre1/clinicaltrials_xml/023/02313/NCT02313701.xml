	<brief_title>Effect Standardized Consent Urogynecological Procedures Patient Satisfaction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The current standard care consent patient undergo urogynecological procedure involve counsel patient procedure , treatment option , risk , benefit , pre-op post-op period . This counsel routinely do verbally may consistently standardize across patient . Pre-operatively , patient may undergo test post-operatively , patient may admit hospital and/or discharge urinary catheter follow void trial . Patients may also experience pain constipation post-operatively hospital home long term may experience recurrence symptom require reoperation . The exist literature cite many example quality improvement initiative study focus improve surgical consent process , patient ' understanding satisfaction . Several systematic review include prospective randomize controlled trial use various patient counseling intervention include video , computer program , electronic presentation , website , powerpoint , write information find improved patient comprehension knowledge consistently affect satisfaction ( Farrell et al . Patient Education Counseling . 2012 ; 94:20-32 . Nehme et al . Surg Innov . 2013 ; 20 ( 1 ) :13-23 . Schenker et al . Med Decis Making . 2011 ; 31:151-173. ) . Most trial report outcomes include overall satisfaction , knowledge score , perceive understanding ( Hoppe et al . J Shoulder Elbow Surg . 2014 ; 23 : e134-e139 . Johannes et al . Ann Surg Oncol . 2013 ; 20:15-23 . Bollschweiler et al . Ann Surg . 2008 ; 258:205-211. ) . However , prospective randomize control trial improve consent process use medium aid urogynecological procedure . A related prospective study report patient ' understanding sacrocolpopexy without intervention find deficiency mean knowledge score less 70 100 ( Adams et al . Female Pelvic Med Reconstr Surg . 2012 ; 18 ( 6 ) :352-356. ) . In study , hope incorporate ass effectiveness standardize visual presentation addition standard care . We hope use result study inform clinical practice improve patient ' understanding satisfaction . Design Overview Our randomized control trial investigate effect standardize consent three urogynecologic procedure ( vaginal hysterectomy , robotic sacrocolpopexy , sub-urethral sling ) use visual medium , patient ' understanding , satisfaction , procedure . Eligible patient recruited member research team pre-operative clinic visit . Participants decline enroll access additional material , receive standard level care enrol participant . Currently , standard care consent patient three procedure involve verbally counseling patient procedures involves , treatment option , risk , benefit , expect pre-op post-op period . In study , three surgical procedure , use computer-generated scheme allocate participant 1:1 ratio use block randomization . Participants randomize one two study arm : 1 . Participants receive standard counsel describe 2 . Participants receive counsel describe review standardize visual presentation procedure undergo . Each participant first provide standard care would receive pre-operative clinic visit . Then , participant intervention arm view visual presentation address type procedure undergo , risk benefit procedure ( i.e . injury nearby organ , risk infection bleeding , risk re-operation ) , alternative treatment procedure , expect pre-operative period , expect post-operative period ( i.e . urinary catheter , constipation , pain management , hospital stay ) . Time spent view visual presentation record assess efficiency quality improvement intervention . At end clinic visit , participate patient receive survey evaluate understanding procedure , pre-operative post-operative expectation , satisfaction experience . A similar survey repeat surgery post-operative clinic visit approximately 1-2 week follow surgery . Outcome Ascertainment Our primary outcome patient 's knowledge score end pre-operative clinic visit , secondary outcome include patient ' satisfaction , subjective understanding procedure , immediate pre-operative post-operative knowledge , number post-operative encounter . Participants follow post-operative clinic visit .</detailed_description>
