	<brief_summary>This trial look use umbilical cord blood unrelated donor high dose chemotherapy . It people cancer bone marrow lymphatic system include leukaemia lymphoma , blood disorder call myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . The trial baby 4 week old , child , adult age 45 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Myloablative Cord Blood Transplant Haematological Malignancies ( MAC UCBT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During treatment cancer bone marrow lymphatic system , lot stem cell damage may need bone marrow stem cell transplant replace . Stem cell also collect umbilical cord newborn baby . Many people around world donate baby 's umbilical cord store safely . There usually enough cell one cord transplant small child , may enough cell old child adult . Researchers want see adult child safely stem cell 1 umbilical cord . Before transplant , high dos chemotherapy , sometimes radiotherapy . This intensive conditioning aim destroy cell bone marrow , call myeloablative conditioning . The aim trial see transplant use cord blood cell unrelated donor myeloablative condition safe , whether helps people need stem cell transplant n't stem cell donor . You may able enter trial : - Have leukaemia , lymphoma another disorder bone marrow treatment intensive conditioning follow stem cell transplant likely help - Do suitable stem cell donor family , doctor able find matched unrelated donor - Have satisfactory blood test result - Are 4 week 45 year old You enter trial : - Have family member could donate stem cell , match unrelated donor - Can treatment doctor think cure disease keep control long time - Have already lot radiotherapy ( trial doctor advise ) - Have already bone marrow stem cell transplant use cell - Have chronic myeloid leukaemia chronic phase respond imatinib , blast phase respond treatment Have acute lymphoblastic leukaemia respond treatment come back 5 % bone marrow make immature cell ( blast ) - Have acute myeloid leukaemia respond treatment come back 20 % bone marrow make immature cell ( blast ) - Have disease come back another type treatment ( salvage treatment ) disease respond get bad - Have blood disorder call myelofibrosis - Have blood disorder call aplastic anaemia - Have infection control medication - Have either HIV HTLV virus - Are pregnant breastfeed This phase 2 trial aim recruit 60 people . It include adults child . Everybody take part intensive conditioning transplant stem cell umbilical cord blood least 1 unrelated donor . To take part trial , researcher need sure 2 lot cord blood cell would suitable . They use cell 2 cord concern wo n't get enough cell 1 umbilical cord . People age 2 45 ( apart child age 16 acute myeloid leukaemia , juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia ( JMML ) MDS ) condition fludarabine , cyclophosphamide radiotherapy whole body ( total body irradiation ) . This take 9 day together . On last day , stem cell drip vein . Children 2 year age ( child age 16 acute myeloid leukaemia , JMML MDS ) condition busulfan , cyclophosphamide melphalan . They radiotherapy . This conditioning take 10 day together . They stem cell drip vein 11th day . The stem cell find way bone marrow start make new blood cell . You see trial team test start treatment . The test include : - Physical examination - Blood test - Chest X-ray - Lung function test - Heart trace ( ECG ) - Heart ultrasound ( echocardiogram ) MUGA scan - Bone marrow test When treatment , hospital 4 6 week . As high risk infection , room . This call isolation . You another bone marrow test month transplant . When go home , go back hospital regular blood test . This likely 2 3 time week begin . You may go back hospital day point . After transplant , see doctor blood test At least week first 3 month At least month rest first year The trial doctor follow progress closely least 2 year . The main side effect treatment transplant drop number blood cell , cause increase risk infection , tiredness breathing problem . We information fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , busulfan melphalan cancer drug section . It take longer blood cell start grow transplant cord blood type stem cell transplant . Even blood count get back normal , immune system may take 2 year recover fully . Unfortunately , treatment affect ability child ( fertility ) . Men take part offer option store sperm ( sperm banking ) start treatment . Preserving fertility woman complicate important woman talk doctor start treatment . After type bone marrow stem cell transplant , risk graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . This happen new stem cell attack body tissue . It mainly affect skin , gut liver . Rarely , new stem cell fail start work . This common cord blood transplant bone marrow transplant . And even transplant successful , risk disease may come back . Because risk , doctor monitor closely transplant .</detailed_description>
