	<brief_summary>Coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) pandemic condition elderly patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) associate bad prognosis . Although available data show association testosterone level men CAD , association testosterone CAC old-aged male patient CAD remain unknown . In study , relationship serum testosterone level CAC score elderly male patient CAD evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Association Testosterone Levels With Coronary Artery Calcification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) associate bad outcome patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , especially old-aged population . Extensive CAC also increase risk procedure associate complication , stent migration , coronary artery perforation , dissection thrombosis . The pathogenesis CAC fully explain . Recent evidence suggest CAC share common pathways bone formation . So , presumed risk factor contribute bone formation resorption activity also affect development CAC . Sex hormone know play important role bone development bone quality maintenance . Available data show androgen may affect differentiation , proliferation , apoptosis osteocyte , osteoclast , osteoblast . Androgen receptor expression detect different type cell contribute bone formation , osteoblastes , osteocytes condrocytes , androgen deprivation therapy result negative effect bone mineral density patient metastatic prostate cancer . Osteoporosis , systemic disease characterize bone tissue loss , prevalent oler men low testosterone level . In CAC , pathophysiological research show several vascular cell type , vascular smooth muscle cell , adventitial myofibroblasts microvascular pericytes , potential produce mineralize matrix differentiate osteoblast . So , postulate androgen may play similar role development CAC . Up date , limited data available association testosterone CAC . A single-center study relatively small sample reveal inverse association testosterone CAC non-obese men . The aim study investigate association testosterone CAC measure CAC score old-aged male patient CAD .</detailed_description>
