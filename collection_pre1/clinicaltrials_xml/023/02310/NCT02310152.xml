	<brief_title>Explanatory Clinical Trial Novel Parent Intervention Childhood Anxiety ( SPACE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite strong evidence efficacy individual cognitive-behavior therapy ( ICBT ) childhood anxiety disorder , 50 % child remain symptomatic treatment many still meet diagnostic criterion . Evidence parental influence etiology maintenance anxiety child often lead reasonable assumption add parent work ICBT would enhance treatment effect . This idea repeatedly test randomize control trial ( RCTs ) compare ICBT ICBT add parent work . The specific content parent work vary mainly include teaching parent skills contingency management , model appropriate behavior , reduce family conflict . Working parent way far lead enhanced treatment effect compare ICBT alone , number meta-analytic comprehensive review show . One plausible conclusion data parent work enhance effect beyond achieve ICBT alone . This study focus alternative plausible conclusion : That parent intervention need inform theoretical work model parent-specific mechanism change target ICBT ; parent intervention need evaluate explanatory RCTs ask 'does treatment work ? ' also 'how treatment work ? ' Underlying system shape parent respond child anxiety distress provide clue parent-specific target intervention point potential moderator treatment response . Identifying mechanisms parent intervention enhance child anxiety outcome , identify marker parent need intervention advance goal personalize psychotherapy , overall goal study . Family accommodation ( FA ) describe parent ' attempt help child avoid feel anxious participate symptom-driven behavior modify family routine . FA highly prevalent among parent anxious child link great symptom severity child poor response ICBT . Research link number biological behavioral parent marker protective parental behavior child anxiety . The nonapeptide oxytocin ( OT ) implicate parental attachment protective behavior human animal . Coded behavioral observation link aspect parental behavior ( i.e. , autonomy granting , involvement , sensitivity ) child anxiety . A number study also show biological behavioral marker interact predict anxiety outcomes at-risk child . Yet far research siloed intervention research inform parent-based treatment , highlight need clinical investigator equip necessary skill integrate multiple unit analysis explanatory RCTs novel intervention . This study represent fusion clinical , biological behavioral research explanatory RCT parent-based treatment focus modify parental response child anxiety distress mediator treatment outcome , biological behavioral marker possible moderator treatment outcome . The intervention evaluate study ( Supportive Parenting Anxious Childhood Emotions ; SPACE ) aim systematically reduce FA series concrete manualized step . This study integrate explanatory RCT SPACE follow 3 specific aim : Aim 1 - Specificity : Does SPACE lead significantly low level FA compare ICBT ? Hypothesis : Levels FA parent SPACE significantly low treatment treatment , compare parent child ICBT . Aim 2 - Mediation : Does reduce FA lead positive child outcome ? Hypothesis : Parents ' reduce FA significant mediator positive child outcome ( i.e. , reduce child anxiety ) . Aim 3 - Moderation : Do key biological behavioral marker ( i.e. , parental OT , autonomy granting , involvement , sensitivity ) moderate child outcome ? Hypothesis : Baseline level maternal OT , autonomy granting , involvement , sensitivity significant moderator child outcome ( i.e. , reduce child anxiety ) .</detailed_description>
