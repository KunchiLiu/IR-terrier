	<brief_summary>This study feasibility study Nucleus 24 ABI child without NF2 . It conduct repeated-measures , single subject experiment order accommodate know variability cochlear implant clinical result . Data obtain course study compare exist publish outcome data child normal hear cochlear implant ( CIs ) . These comparison may provide additional useful information progress ABI subject ' performance time . Also , may allow result current study utilize design future pivotal study device pediatric population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Auditory Brainstem Implant ( ABI ) Children With No Cochleae Auditory Nerves</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate clinical safety efficacy Nucleus™ 24 Auditory Brainstem Implant ( ABI ) pediatric patient Neurofibromatosis Type 2 ( NF2 ) ; specifically , child total hearing loss due severe cochlear anomaly , cochlear nerve disorder fail cochlear implantation . These condition include : developmental acquire cochlear nerve deficiency ( CND ) , cochlear aplasia , post-meningitis cochlear ossification , cochlear malformation . This study propose implant 10 pre-linguistic young child ( 18 mos 5 yr . age ) 10 post-linguistic child ( &lt; 21 yr age ) Nucleus 24 Multichannel ABI attempt demonstrate safety surgical procedure device stimulation potential auditory benefit beyond experienced CI . These child would qualify Nucleus ABI device , etiology approve indication neurofibromatosis Type 2 ( NF2 ) . Further , child benefit conventional hearing aid cochlear implant . Two group child include : Group 1 include prelingiustic deaf child age 18 month - 5 year Group 2 include postlinguistic deaf child &lt; 21 year age . Post-operative evaluation conduct initial activation 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36-month interval post-activation order demonstrate emergence open-set speech perception ability prior study cessation . Experience CI literature show minimum 2 year device usage require child pre-lingual hearing impairment develop open-set speech perception ability . While Group 2 post-linguistic may significant hearing prior become deaf , time interval use consistency . Blinding masking procedure include design , presence/absence brainstem implant easily conceal device recipient and/or clinical investigator .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Group 1 : Prelinguistic hearing loss ( birth5 year ; age implantation ABI 18 months5 year ) • Prelinguistic hearing loss ( birth5 yr . ; age ABI 18 months5yrs ) : MRI +/ CT evidence one following : Cochlear nerve deficiency Cochlear aplasia severe hypoplasia Severe inner ear malformation Postmeningitis ossification When cochlea present patent , lack significant benefit CI despite consistent use ( &gt; 6 mo . ) No limited speech perception ability ( limited pattern perception close set testing material use CI ) Lack progress auditory skill development Group 2 : Postlinguistic hearing loss ( &lt; 21 yr . age ) Postlinguistic hearing loss ( &lt; 21 yr . age ) : Loss lack benefit appropriate CI without possibility revision contralateral implantation . Examples might include : Postmeningitis ossification Bilateral temporal bone fracture cochlear nerve avulsion Failed revision CI without benefit Previously develop open set speech perception auditoryoral language skills No medical contraindication Willing receive appropriate meningitis vaccination No limited cognitive/developmental delay . Strong family support Reasonable expectation parents/guardians include thorough understanding : potential benefit limitation ABI parental role rehabilitation child may develop spoken language primary communication mode even sufficient spoken language make significant academic progress aural/oral environment Involvement rehabilitation program emphasize development auditory skill without use supplementary visual communication . Able comply study requirement include travel investigation site . Informed consent procedure child 's parents/legal guardian . For Groups 1 2 : Pre postlinguistic child currently make significant progress CI Even young child ( 18 month age 6 month use ) , nearly child good auditory signal CI show evidence improvement metric time . MRI evidence one following : normal cochlea cochlear nerve NF2 brainstem cortical anomaly make implantation unfeasible Clear surgical reason poor CI performance remediate revision CI contralateral surgery rather ABI . Intractable seizure progressive , deteriorate neurological disorder Patients evidence Chiari malformation , hydrocephalus , spina bifid Patients foreseeable need future MRI scan Unable participate behavioral test mapping CI . If appear age effect , ABI delay assure child able participate , reliable objective measure map currently available map device . Unable tolerate general anesthesia ( cardiac , pulmonary , bleed diathesis , etc. ) . Need brainstem irradiation Unrealistic expectation part subject/family regard possible benefit , risk limitation inherent procedure ABI device . Unwilling sign inform consent . Unwilling make necessary followup appointment .</criteria>
