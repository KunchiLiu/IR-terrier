	<brief_summary>This randomize , double-blind , single center clinical trial study compare oocyte maturity , embryo development , risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) receive standard dose human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) ovulation trigger lower dose hCG plus concomitant follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) co-trigger woman undergo vitro fertilization ( IVF ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Administration FSH Low Dose hCG Oocyte Maturity While Decreasing hCG Exposure IVF Cycles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The success rate assist reproductive technology ( ART ) dramatically increase due improvement embryo culture , laboratory condition , optimization different ovarian stimulation protocol . Recent data show hCG administer oocyte maturation , severe OHSS rare . However , gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) agonist cycle , hCG require . Previous study reveal small dose hCG use ovulation trigger versus standard dose effect induction final oocyte maturation possibly reduce risk OHSS . However , minimal dose require hCG maintain maximal success rate IVF know adequately study randomize controlled trial . Interestingly , previous randomize control study reveal concomitant administration FSH hCG ( 10,000 IU ) , physiological process , improve developmental oocyte competence . In study , OHSS group receive FSH co-trigger . A subsequent study perform randomized trial determine FSH co-trigger reduce incidence OHSS find , may prevent OHSS . Additionally , clinical experience ( unpublished data ) reveals administer 1,500 IU hCG plus 450 IU FSH co-trigger enough promote adequate oocyte maturation increase risk develop OHSS high risk patient . Given finding , propose modification ovulation trigger decrease exposure hCG . Our objective determine concomitant administration FSH decrease dose hCG versus standard dose hCG alone ovulation promote improve oocyte maturation quality , decrease risk OHSS . The select FSH dose 450 IU think parallel physiologic FSH surge observe natural cycle . We choose 1,500 IU designate low dose hCG base previous study show even hCG dos low 2,000 IU allow oocytes undergo maturation well clinical experience demonstrate adequate oocyte maturity fertilization patient choose receive 1,500 IU hCG , due risk OHSS . Study participant recruit Reproductive Endocrinology Infertility Clinic University California San Francisco Center Reproductive Health . Couples undergo IVF offer participation study . Approximately 100 subject randomized time enrollment receive either standard dose hCG alone low dose hCG ( 1,500 IU ) + FSH ( 450 IU ) oocyte maturation trigger research coordinator . There 50 subject study arm . Each subject undergo standard IVF stimulation protocol choose primary physician . Study participant receive syringe ( prepared research coordinator ) day ovulation trigger contain either standard dose hCG low dose hCG + FSH accord randomization . The subject trigger follow : 1 . Control arm : Standard dose hCG ( 10,000 5,000 IU ) 2 . Experimental arm : hCG 1,500 IU SQ + FSH 450 IU SQ . For control arm , standard hCG dose give base estradiol ( E2 ) level . If E2 level le 3,500 pg/ml trigger 10,000 IU hCG . If E2 level 3,500 pg/ml less 5,000 pg/ml trigger 5,000 IU . Interventions prevent OHSS high risk patient : Any patient either arm E2 serum level &gt; 5,000 pg/ml day expect trigger administration exclude study . These patient individually assess primary physician . Their primary physician decide safe trigger option base patient 's risk OHSS . From clinical experience , expect &lt; 5 % subject E2 serum level &gt; 5,000 pg/ml exclude . The hCG FSH trigger shot patient prepare unblinded nurse day patient administer medication . The subject self-administer ovulation trigger designated time give monitoring physician . Subjects return day oocyte maturation trigger blood draw ass serum hormone level ( estradiol , progesterone , hCG , FSH LH ) . The oocyte retrieval perform 36 hour oocyte maturation trigger . All egg retrieval perform use transvaginal ultrasound associate needle guide standard fashion . Both physician laboratory personnel blind study . All visible follicle aspirate . The first follicle ovary every patient aspirate system ( needle tubing ) flush separate tube prior aspirate remain follicle direct correlation follicular size oocyte recovery maturation , embryo development separately assess . Additionally , follicular fluid first aspirate collect future hormone assay . Oocyte strip perform standard protocol . The status oocyte maturation time strip ( approximately 38-40 hour hCG administration ) end intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) procedure ( approximately 40-42 hour hCG administration ) record . Fertilization assess 16-19 hour insemination . The embryo transfer growth medium culture standard protocol . To assess incidence OHSS , patient evaluate objectively change abdominal circumference well subjectively clinical symptomatology base patient 's bloating symptom . Prior start stimulation , abdominal circumference ( C ) body weight ( BW ) also measure centimeter baseline ultrasound visit ( C baseline , BW baseline ) . Five day oocyte retrieval abdominal circumference body weight measure centimeter ( C stimulate , BW stimulate ) . The difference abdominal circumference body weight calculated follow : C baseline - C stimulate = CΔ . ; BW baseline - BW stimulate = BWΔ . The patient 's clinical symptom evaluate base bloating score report patient trigger shot administer 5 day oocyte retrieval determine . A venipuncture also obtain hormone assay 5 day oocyte retrieval . Patients diagnose OHSS manage physician clinically indicate . The number follow-up clinic visit hospitalization secondary symptom OHSS record .</detailed_description>
