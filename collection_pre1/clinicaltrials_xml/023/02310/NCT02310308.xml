	<brief_title>Effect Sugar-Free Chewing Gum Containing Magnolia Bark Extract Caries Lesions Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Dental caries incidence adult similar child adolescent , caries preventive agent evaluate effectiveness adult population . Magnolia bark extract ( MBE ) plant extract obtain bark magnolia widely use traditional Chinese medicine 2,000 year , Magnolia officinalis use treatment acute pain , diarrhea , cough urinary problem . The two main constituent bark medicinal plant magnolol honokiol . They know possess variety pharmacological property , include therapeutic-related activity central nervous system inhibition anti-inflammatory effect , antimicrobial activity , antioxidative activity freeradical scavenging activity . Magnolol andhonokiol also report inhibit growth Streptococcus mutans , Streptococcus sobrinus , Porphyromonas gingivalis , Fusobacterium nucleatum , Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans , Capnocytophaga gingivalis Veillonella disper vitro reduce dental caries value rat . Consequently , antimicrobial property MBE cariogenic plaque bacteria show promising result . The effect chew gum contain MBE xylitol different variable relate caries gingivitis sample adult volunteer high risk caries evaluate . The main result double-blind randomize controlled interventional trial chew gum contain MBE effective reduce plaque acidogenicity , salivary mutans streptococci concentration gingival bleeding compare xylitol sugar-free chewing gum . Materials Methods A two-year , placebo-controlled , double-blind , randomized clinical trial sponsor Perfetti Van Melle test effect caries lesion development daily use chew gum contain Magnolia Bark Extract xylitol conduct . The trial take place dental clinic locate dental school University Sassari Milan . The study approve Ethical Committee University Sassari . Study Population Principal inclusion criterion age range ( 30-55 year ) presence least one cavitated caries lesion , three . Subjects systemic disease interfere oral ecosystem exclude . The caries criterion design include participant risk form new lesion . Sample size preliminary screening calculate basis previous study regard caries prevalence ( 26 % ) adult [ Campus et al , 2011 ] relative odds ratio 2.88 incidence , report literature [ Ito et al , 2011 ] . Thus , theoretical sample size preliminary screening set 1200 subject . In order get statistical comparison result , number subject per group include analysis calculate . Considering 35 % difference among group significant , 95 % probability obtain significant difference among group 5 % level , result number subject per group set 104 . To ensure adequate quantity surface risk , participant require minimum 12 natural teeth . Treatment The subject randomly assign three group : Magnolia Xylitol group ( MX group ) use chew gum contain MBE xylitol , Xylitol group ( X group ) use chew gum content xylitol free MBE finally Control group ( C group ) , use sugar-free chewing gum without MBE xylitol . Each subject instruct chew 1 2 pellet 5 minute , 3 time day ( 2 morning , 2 midday meal 1 afternoon ) . Thus , total daily intake magnolol honokiol MX group 11.9 mg/day . The daily use three different chew gum carry 12 month . Three clinical evaluation caries diagnosis perform : one baseline , second end chew period ( 12 month baseline ) third 24 month baseline assessment . A microbiological evaluation cariogenic bacteria perform immediately clinical assessment . Mutans streptococci lactobacillus count saliva assess categorized use dip-slide technique ( CTR bacteria , Ivoclar Vivadent , Germany ) . Following sugar challenge , measure interdental plaque pH , use pH indicator strip ( Spezialindikator , pH range 4.0-7.0 ; Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) , perform 5 different point : baseline , 6 month chew gum use , 12 month chew gum use , 6 month end chew gum use ( 18 month baseline ) finally 12 month end chew gum use ( 24 month baseline ) . Randomization Eligible enrolees randomize either active control arm . Randomization carry use computer-based program . Staff participant blind treatment assignment . Study Outcomes The primary study outcome cumulative D2 Filled Surface ( D2 FS ) increment ( root coronal surface combine ) cumulate baseline two follow-up examination . In addition caries increment , data participant safety risk factor related caries development collect . Expected result The result RCT bring clarity effectiveness MBE caries preventive agent .</detailed_description>
