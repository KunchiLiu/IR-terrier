	<detailed_description>Anaemia state decrease blood oxygen carry capacity . Acute anaemia associate increase tissue oxygen extraction . On hand , chronic anaemia human body time least partially adapt decrease blood oxygen carry capacity , . Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) non-invasive method ass tissue oxygenation ( StO2 ) estimate tissue haemoglobin ( THb ) level . The investigator study skeletal muscle StO2 critically ill patient preserve oxygen ( i.e. , cardiogenic shock ) impair oxygen extraction ( i.e. , septic shock ) , , . In addition measure rest StO2 , investigator perform vascular occlusion test stop arterial blood flow , estimate oxygen consumption , end occlusion , also possible estimate vascular reactivity maximal reperfusion capability . Under acute blood loss trauma patient , skeletal muscle StO2 measure NIRS correlate blood haemoglobin ( Hb ) delivery oxygen , easily detect latent stage haemorrhagic shock . Unexpectedly , chronically anaemic haematology patient preserve oxygen extraction capability show low skeletal StO2 THb index despite severe anaemia , would predict normal physiological response . It known structural functional change RBCs storage . Recent study detect deleterious effect RBC storage microvascular response transfusion stable anaemic trauma patient . The aim present study re-challenge current data anaemia chronically anaemic haematology patient associate low skeletal muscle StO2 , age RBCs influence tissue response . The investigator investigate aspect use improved technology NIRS device , deep tissue penetration removal superficial signal skin .</detailed_description>
