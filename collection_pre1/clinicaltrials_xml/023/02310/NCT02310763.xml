	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 randomize , 2-period , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multiple ascend dose study evaluate safety , efficacy , PK PD PF-06252616 administer ambulatory boy diagnose Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy . Three intravenous ( IV ) dose level investigate within subject dose escalate fashion . Subjects randomly assign 1 3 sequence group approximately 96 week ( 2 period 48 week ) . In period 1 , two sequence group receive PF-06252616 one sequence group receive placebo . In period 2 , placebo group switch PF-06252616 two remain sequence group either receive placebo PF-06252616 . Efficacy base observed mean change baseline function ( 4 stair climb ) PF-06252616 compare placebo end period 1 . Period 2 provide opportunity evaluate PK . Subjects receive monthly IV infuse dos either PF-06252616 placebo undergo safety evaluation ( Laboratory , cardiac monitoring , physical exam , x-ray , MRI ) , functional evaluation ( pulmonary function testing , 4 stair climb , range motion , strength testing , Northstar Ambulatory Assessment , upper limb functional test six minute walk test ) , pharmacokinetic test pharmacodynamic test evaluate change muscle volume ( MRI ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Ambulatory boys age 6 &lt; 16 year old ( time randomization ) , diagnose DMD . Diagnosis must confirm subject 's medical history genetic testing obtain routine clinical care diagnostic purpose report appropriate regulated laboratory use clinically validate genetic test ( genetic testing provide sponsor ) . 2 . Subjects able perform 4 stair climb &gt; = 0.33 &lt; =1.6 stairs/second . 3 . Subjects must receive glucocorticosteroids minimum 6 month prior sign inform consent . There significant change ( &gt; 0.2 mg/kg ) dosage dose regimen ( relate body weight change ) least 3 month immediately prior signing informed consent reasonable expectation dosage dose regimen change significantly duration study . 4 . Adequate hepatic renal function screen laboratory assessment . 5 . No underlying disposition iron accumulation screen laboratory assessment . 6 . Iron content estimate screen liver MRI within normal range . 1 . Subjects know cognitive impairment behavioral issue would impede ability follow instruction . 2 . History major surgical procedure within 6 week sign informed consent plan surgery study . 3 . Any injury may impact functional testing . Previous injury must fully heal prior consent . Prior low limb fracture must fully heal least 3 month injury date . 4 . Presence history musculoskeletal neurologic disease somatic disorder relate DMD include pulmonary cardiac disease . 5 . Compromised cardiac function ( left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 55 % determine screening cardiac MRI echocardiogram ) . Subjects may receive ACE ( angiotensin convert enzyme ) inhibitor beta blocker , ARB ( angiotensin II receptor antagonist ) aldosterone blocker/thiazide diuretic ; however must initiate treatment 3 month prior screen ensure stable therapy . 6 . Evidence history clinically significant hematological , renal , endocrine , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular ( include uncontrolled hypertension ) , hepatic , neurologic , allergic disease ( include drug allergy , exclude untreated , asymptomatic , seasonal allergy time dose ) . 7 . Documented history iron overload include hemochromatosis , beta thalassemia major , beta thalassemia intermedia hemolytic anemia . 8 . Unwilling unable ( eg , metal implant , require sedation ) undergo examination close MRI without sedation . 9 . Participation study involve investigational drug ( ) minimum 30 day within 5 half life ( whichever longer ) prior sign inform consent and/or study participation . 10 . Current prior treatment antimyostatin , exon skipping , nonsense mutation target therapy ever 30 day treatment utrophin modifier treatment utrophin modifier within 30 day prior ot sign inform consent and/or study participation . 11 . Current prior treatment within past 3 month androgens human growth hormone . 12 . Current treatment immunosuppressant therapy ( glucocorticoid steroid ) , aminoglycosides ( eg , gentamicin ) , multi vitamin iron iron supplement investigational therapy ( include idebenone ) .</criteria>
