	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND The pathophysiology knee OA pain complex . Altered process nociceptive input spinal high brain center may help explain discrepancy pain severity pathological abnormality OA . Central sensitization describe increased responsiveness nociceptive neuron spinal supraspinal level normal sub-threshold afferent input lead hyperalgesia . It may also include dysfunction endogenous pain control system . Furthermore , peripheral pro-inflammatory mediator neuropeptides knee OA sensitize nociceptors , lower threshold activation . This increase responsiveness peripheral nociceptors refer peripheral sensitization . Both peripheral central nervous system sensitization , clinically refer pain sensitization result enhance , persistent widespread pain response . Recent study find presence increase pain sensitivity remote site , enhance temporal summation hypersensitivity various stimulus associate report severe knee pain symptom . These study cross-sectional although link sign sensitization great level pain disability infer causality . There evidence suggest increase pain sensitivity negatively affect treatment outcome . In painful musculoskeletal condition shoulder impingement lateral epicondylalgia widespread pressure pain sensitivity thermal hyperalgesia , link poor prognosis . Surgical outcome knee osteoarthritis may also affect presence increase pain sensitivity prior total knee replacement associate persistent pain surgery . Physiotherapy widely recommend conservative management approach . Studies prognosis knee OA focus demographic psychological variable , study focus factor relate abnormal pain processing . No longitudinal study explore prognostic factor relate pain sensitization outcome follow physiotherapy . In whiplash associate disorder presence sensory hypersensitivity cold hyperalgesia show reduce likelihood positive response physiotherapy treatment . Thus conceivable , currently unproven , knee OA patient evidence pain sensitization poorer outcomes follow physiotherapy . One obstacle investigate implication pain sensitization reliably identify clinical setting . Clinical criterion propose assess central sensitization rely principally clinician 's subjective interpretation patient symptom . Although useful clinically , research purpose objective measure preferable . Due complexity pain experience inadvisable rely single test reflect peripheral central pain mechanism . A multi-tissue assessment use multi-modal stimulus approach advocate , adopt study . Recognised feature central peripheral sensitization previously identify knee OA patient incorporate study include extend area hyperalgesia , enhance temporal summation , dysfunctional condition pain modulation . This study explore clinical outcome knee OA ( pain , function , patient 's global assessment ) follow physiotherapy , investigate association key feature pain sensitization likelihood poor outcome . Distinguishing patient risk poor outcome help determine appropriate management strategy timely manner . STUDY AIMS : The main aim study ; firstly provide comprehensive description somatosensory characteristic people pain associated knee OA ( mean clinical examination , QST , validate questionnaire measure pain , functional capacity quality life ) secondly , investigate presence pain sensitization baseline associate poor response physiotherapy treatment . METHODS AND ANALYSIS : Study design : A multi-centre observational cohort study assessment baseline , 3 month ( completion physiotherapy treatment ) six month conduct . Following baseline assessment feature pain sensitization participant receive usual physiotherapy care . The relationship pain sensitization outcomes term pain disability explore regression analysis . Setting : The study set physiotherapy outpatient department three large publicly fund teaching hospital Dublin , Ireland . Participants : Patients symptomatic knee OA refer physiotherapy treatment hospital consultant clinical specialist physiotherapist eligible inclusion . Healthy control : Forty age gender match pain-free control recruit . The control provide reference data QST result . Recruitment procedure : A consecutive sample knee osteoarthritis patient moderate/severe knee pain recruit . Potentially eligible participant identify musculoskeletal assessment clinic physiotherapy outpatient wait list . A feasible recruitment rate estimate 12 patient per month recruitment continue specified number achieve . Those agree participate attend baseline assessment prior commence physiotherapy treatment . Written inform consent obtain enrolment study . Physiotherapy management : Physiotherapy treatment line current clinical guideline management knee OA . ( McAlindon et al. , 2014 ) . A workshop lead principal investigator hold recruitment site prior study commencement physiotherapist receive update clinical guideline current best evidence management knee OA . This standardise treatment degree , intervention individualise discretion treat physiotherapist . Assessment Baseline assessment : Each baseline assessment take approximately 50 minute complete physiotherapy clinic principal investigator . Some questionnaire post complete advance participant . Follow assessment : The primary endpoint completion physiotherapy treatment ( expect 3 month ; estimate duration course physiotherapy treatment ) . Six month enrolment study participant complete postal questionnaire assess pain function . They exit study point . Testing procedure : In order improve reliability assessment minimise bias standardise assessment procedure follow . Studies support reliability QST measure protocol standardise tester participant carefully instruct . Outcome Variables : Primary secondary outcome outline section . Identifying Quantifying Pain Sensitization : Abnormal pain pressure thresholds temporal summation previously use identify sub-groups patient widespread pain hypersensitivity . Conditioned pain modulation ( CPM ) reflective endogenous inhibitory capacity nociceptive system dysfunction CPM associate syndrome fibromyalgia temporomandibular joint disorder central sensitization recognise hallmark . Pain sensitization therefore operationalized presence decrease PPTs enhanced temporal summation local ( knee ) remote ( arm ) sit addition dysfunctional CPM . The cut-off point abnormal sensitize determine control data gather spread variability 'normal ' result see . Points sum produce pain sensitization score high score represent great pain sensitization . DATA ANALYSIS PLAN Data analyse use SPSS v 20 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) . Descriptive statistic calculate outcome measure baseline . Initial analysis exploratory compare symptom profile people respond treatment treatment non-responders . Treatment responder categorise OMERACT-OARSI responder criterion . Categorical variable analyse use chi-square test . Multivariate analysis variance ( MANOVA ) use compare continuous normally distribute variable responder non-responders . The Kruskal-Wallis test use comparison variable normally distribute . A p value le 0.05 consider significant . A logistic regression model develop predict response physiotherapy treatment 'treatment responder ' dependant variable . The model adjust predetermined variable base previous literature ( age , gender , obesity , socioeconomic status , depressive symptom , treatment adherence , comorbidities presence widespread pain ) . The pain sensitization score enter regression model independent variable . Sample size : The sample size calculate base number explanatory variable plan inclusion logistic regression model . It intend include 8 explanatory variable allow 15 participant explanatory variable . Recruiting 140 participant allow 20 % loss follow-up ensure adequate number . Dropouts : All participant follow discharge physiotherapy . Patients consider lost follow-up complete primary outcome measure post treatment . DISCUSSION To knowledge first study examine effect pain sensitization clinical outcome response physiotherapy patient knee OA . There lack standardized protocol assess pain sensitization clinical setting . This study select test base utility clinical setting . The result may identify small selection outcome measure practical assess pain sensitization associate increase risk poor outcome . This clinically base observational study aim investigate effect specific physiotherapy treatment . It observe people undergo usual physiotherapy variation intervention expect . Nonetheless attempt standardise care degree make use current evidence base guideline keep record physiotherapy intervention adherence participant . Recruiting participant sample secondary care set limit generalizability study finding patient population primary care . Given relatively short follow-up period infer causality directly data regard pain sensitization physiotherapy outcome . Nonetheless may point relationship worthy investigation order well understand pain mechanism knee OA optimise physiotherapy outcomes future .</detailed_description>
