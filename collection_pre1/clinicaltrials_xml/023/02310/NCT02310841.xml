	<brief_title>Pilot Study Patient-cooperative Control Strategies Actuated Transfemoral Prostheses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Setting study : Conventional prosthesis transfemoral amputee mostly simple mechanic joint , micro-processor-controlled damping . The prototype test study equip motor actively move knee joint . Therefore , movement like , example , alternate stair climb , possible realize pure mechanical actively damped prosthesis . During level-ground walking , hypothesize less compensatory movement need . We develop actuated prototypical prosthesis new control strategy facilitate level-ground walk stair climb . Parts control strategy test able-bodied subject [ 1 ] . This control strategy extend biological stiffness modulation render [ 2 ] . Hypothesis : Subjects use transfemoral prosthesis walk level-ground , climb several step overcome small obstacle without prior training . The user-cooperative control intuitive easily learnable . Objective study : This pilot study mean investigate general feasibility novel control strategy actuate transfemoral prosthesis . Parameters standard gait analysis , like ground reaction force kinematics ( use motion capture system ) , record . From data , gait symmetry , step length , walk speed , measure calculate . The subjective impression user evaluate questionnaire .</detailed_description>
