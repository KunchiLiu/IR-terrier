	<detailed_description>Metastatic melanoma aggressive tumor 5-year survival rate 6 month . Although recent progress make treatment metastatic melanoma , improved patient survival still limit primary resistance relapse . It therefore important continue understand molecular mechanism involve melanoma development progression improve current treatment / discover new anti-metastatic melanoma treatment . Drugs alkylating agent ( temozolomide fotemustine ) vemurafenib trigger senescence-like phenotype melanoma cell . Although senescence process limit proliferation cell , know senescent cell secrete factor exert pro-tumoral role . If many study focus role soluble factor secretome , potential existence role insoluble factor remain undetermined . Preliminary result investigator laboratory indicate presence senescent secretome exosomes ; microvesicles involve intercellular communication , immunomodulatory function , tumorigenesis . The exovesicules discharge cell environment subject increase interest oncology prognostic factor marker therapeutic response . Several study show vesicle shape tumor microenvironment contribute migration cancer cell . This project aim study effect exosomes produce senescent melanoma cell development progression melanoma vitro vivo use cell culture animal model . In addition , investigator propose pilot study whose objective determine effect vemurafenib production , quantity , size composition nanovesicles produce patient advance unresectable metastatic melanoma . The investigator hope show exosomes participate process drug resistance relapse , goal developing ( exosomes study ) theranostic tool personalize care patient .</detailed_description>
