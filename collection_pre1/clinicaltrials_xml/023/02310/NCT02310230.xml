	<brief_summary>Purpose : To assess utility new medical device monitor patient 's breathe medical procedure patient sedate , mechanically ventilate . In minor procedure , endoscopy ( doctor examine patient 's digestive tract TV camera insert mouth ) , patient require general anesthesia , machine would take breathe unconscious surgery . However , endoscopic procedure sometimes difficult anesthesiologist monitor patient 's breathingâ€”specifically , monitor change breathe pattern adequacy breathe . In endoscopy procedure , room darken , patient 's mouth generally occupy endoscope . While anesthesiologist listen patient 's breathing sound stethoscope , type monitoring do periodically , limited ability gauge adequacy ventilation . This study use ExSpiron Respiratory Volume Monitor ( RVM ) , measure non-invasive minute ventilation ( MV ) , tidal volume ( TV ) respiratory rate ( RR ) , patient undergo endoscopic procedure provide additional information regard effect clinical intervention drug administration airway maneuver patient 's respiratory status . For patient give informed consent , study participation mean PadSet consist 3 electrode apply chest . Another component , nasal cannula ( thin clear plastic tube go nose ) give patient supplemental oxygen , standard care endoscopy UVM Medical Center . Patients ask breathe portable spirometer ( breath meter ) 30 second five time . This data compare data record monitor confirm monitor record accurately . The procedure go forward normal fashion . Patients randomly place one two group . In first group procedure , anesthesiologist able see number ( MV , TV , RR ) display screen monitor , data use guide patient 's clinical care . In second group , anesthesiologist able see RVM measurement MV , TV , RR evaluate effect intervention . Monitoring group continue recovery room , discharge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation Utility ExSpiron Respiratory Variation Monitor During Upper GI Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess utility ExSpiron Respiratory Variation Monitor patient undergo interventional procedure anesthesia . The primary outcome measure average minute ventilation patient procedure . This study also examine correlation clinical intervention drug administration airway maneuver data monitor . Additionally study may provide information ability new monitoring system prevent hypoxemia procedure consider utility , compare capnography , detect hypopnea . Background Assessing adequacy ventilation Monitored Anesthesia Care ( MAC ) sedation difficult . Agents use provide procedural sedation depress ventilatory drive interfere airway patency , make much likely patient hypoventilate experience partial complete obstruction ventilation . [ It actually clinically easy administer general anesthesia insert airway management device endotracheal tube laryngeal mask airway , however give superior recovery profile follow sedation vs. general anesthesia , usually preferable administer sedation , procedure perform use . ] The American Society Anesthesiologists maintain database close malpractice claim allow analysis pattern injury . A study consider claim MAC/sedation case find 40 % MAC claim result death brain damage , 25 % claim associate oversedation/hypoventilation occur endoscopy suite , 44 % oversedation case could prevent good monitoring.1 A study compare claim remote location ( endoscopy ) operating room , find 50 % remote location claim involve monitor anesthesia care , proportion claim death increase remote location claim [ 54 vs. 29 % ( operate room claim ) ] , respiratory damaging event common remote location claim ( 44 vs. 20 % ) , inadequate oxygenation/ventilation common specific event ( 21 vs. 3 % operating room claim ) , remote location claim often judge preventable well monitoring ( 32 vs. 8 % operating room claim ) .2 Upper endoscopy procedure , upper GI endoscopy endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) , particularly challenge anesthesiologist limited access patient 's head work darken room . Indeed investigator find difficult find combination propofol short act opioid allows instrumentation esophagus without `` intolerable ventilatory depression '' .3 Trying assess ventilation observe chest excursion listen ventilation stethoscope condition difficult do periodically . Side-stream nasal cannula end-tidal capnography offer possible solution , cannula become dislodged proceduralist 's endoscope often interfere function . End-tidal capnography non-intubated patient insensitive change minute ventilation . At best , technology usually assess presence absence ventilation : limited ability judge adequacy ventilation quantify it.4 The Study Device The ExSpiron Respiratory Volume Monitor ( Respiratory Motion , Inc. , Waltham MA ) FDA 501 ( k ) clearance use patient care . It consist proprietary PadSet place chest mid-axillary line connect free stand monitor . This monitor measure analyze change thoracic electrical impedance occur respiratory duty cycle . It able quantify respiratory rate also determine tidal volume minute ventilation well graphically display change lung volume . It show accurately measure effect intervention ( medication , airway maneuver ) endoscopy patients.5 Preliminary work determine optimal lead placement demonstrate excellent correlation spirometry R value 0.94-0.98 excellent accuracy precision.6 Preliminary work cite show monitor provide information effect medication airway maneuver breathe pattern available routine monitoring . This study seek extend knowledge investigate whether use information real-time result different respiratory measurement compare patient routine monitoring .</detailed_description>
