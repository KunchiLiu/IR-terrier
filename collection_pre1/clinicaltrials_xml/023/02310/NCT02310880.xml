	<brief_summary>Low vision patient difficulty acquire sufficient visual information timely manner purpose perform challenge daily task , travel independently safely busy street . The advance virtual reality technique provide potential platform training low vision patient use remain vision efficiently , key issue always whether patient 's visual experience virtual world transfer real world . The propose study design provide definite answer question .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Enhancing Low Vision Mobility Thru Visual Training Virtual World</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NEI 's National Plan Eye Vision Research identify Low Vision Blindness Rehabilitation one pressing need opportunity vision research . Since low vision ( LV ) patient nowadays useable vision , important aspect LV rehabilitation maximize use patient 's remain vision . Visual skill especially important task travel independently busy street , distant , rapidly change event direct impact patient 's task efficiency safety . The patient learn new information acquisition skill compensate impaired vision . Current LV training skill do real street one-on-one , trainer/trainee session . This way training , however , usually expose client circumstance need deal , usually provide graded level task difficulty repeatable condition facilitate learning , meet need majority LV patient shortage high cost LV trainer . The advance virtual reality ( VR ) technology make possible affordable realistically simulate complex dynamic visual auditory environment facilitate LV rehabilitation . However , important first step apply VR technology LV rehabilitation determine whether visual experience LV person transfer real world . Only positive transfer visual skill confirm , subsequent development comprehensive VR train system aspects LV rehabilitation become worthwhile . The purpose study accomplish first step . A set visual skill visually challenge task , cross signal-controlled street , select standard orientation mobility curriculum study virtual experience transfer . Existing technology use build desktop computer-based VR simulator generate virtual street intersection scenario contain visual auditory information require practicing skill study . Computer generate street intersection pedestrian , traffic control signal project large screen participant view , like movie . Twenty LV person recruit university LV rehabilitation facility . They randomly assign practice select visual skill real virtual street intersection . Their skill level evaluate real intersection immediately schedule training . The primary outcome interest mean change visual skill pre- post-training evaluation two group . The training rehabilitation intervention change visual/audio information gathering skill train observe . The participant train evaluated sidewalk real virtual street . They never allow step curb avoid exposure danger . The long-term goal develop interactive VR train system multiple sensory motor input output module incorporate collective experience LV rehabilitation profession . Adding system LV curriculum greatly improve affordability , accessibility , efficiency scope LV rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
