	<brief_title>Cvac Maintenance Treatment Patients With Resected Stage I Stage II Adenocarcinoma ( Cancer ) Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total approximately 40 patient 30 clinical site screen eligibility study within 6 week complete treatment , include R0 ( complete resection microscopic residual tumor ) R1 ( complete resection grossly visible tumor microscopically positive margin ) surgery stage I stage II adenocarcinoma pancreas without chemotherapy radiation . Eligible patient must measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 ( Eisenhauer 2009 ) tumor marker carbohydrate antigen 19-9 [ CA 19-9 ] great 2 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) follow surgery without chemotherapy radiation . Prior surgery , neoadjuvant chemotherapy , adjuvant chemotherapy , radiation therapy allow .</detailed_description>
