	<detailed_description>The prevalence chronic non-communicable disease , include cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , type-2 diabetes ( DM ) , common mental disorder ( CMD ) , i.e . anxiety &amp; depression , increase worldwide , include India , patient CMD underserved , especially rural area , due stigma lack trained provider . Treatment patient dual diagnosis involve special challenge , leave untreated , mental illness contribute non-adherence worsen outcome . Similarly , lack staff train India 's Primary Health Centers ( PHC ) result miss diagnosis , inappropriate treatment , increase morbidity suffering . A grow body research suggest challenge overcome integrating treatment patient co-morbid diagnosis , use `` step '' `` collaborative '' care model . Such integration may also help reduce stigma seek mental health service . We plan address need implement evaluate multi-level integrate intervention collaboration 50 Primary Health Clinics ( PHC ) rural Karnataka use cluster Randomized Controlled Trial ( cRCT ) . Our approach base team 's previous clinical behavioral research region build decade long collaboration St. John 's Research Institute University California San Francisco . This study bring together Indo-US team scientist government representative expertise treat study mental health , chronic disease , behavior change , stigma , conduct large clinical trial rural India . It also build work India 's National Rural Health Mission ( NRHM ) , recently announce add tobacco control agenda . If successful , intervention thus high potential scale-up sustainability . The propose intervention inform Social Ecological Paradigm articulate relationship social setting health behavior . It use behavior change strategy guide Cognitive Social Theory . Patients intervention PHCs receive integrate collaborative clinic care physician , nurse case manager consult psychiatrist . They also participate 12-month community-based `` Healthy Living group , '' cognitive behavioral strategy use target health promote behavior , increased activity , improve diet , adherence medical regimen , well problem-solving skill , cop skill , social support . These group initially co-facilitated Master 's level mental health professional train lay community health outreach worker ( ASHA ) weekly basis 3 month . During remain 9 month , ASHA conduct monthly booster session focus maintenance acquire health-promoting behavior . Patients control PHCs receive `` enhanced standard '' care model , include provide referral mental health need . To ensure standardization study procedure across setting , control PHC staff receive basic training establish clinical protocol , plus train prescription anti-depressant medication . While may represent somewhat intervention , consider ethical allow clinically depressed patient treat vitamin anxiolytic , currently frequently use PHC . Following brief start-up phase adapt measure finalize protocol , propose : 1 . Use ASHAs conduct community-based screening depression , anxiety , DM CVD risk factor community health fair catchment area 25 PHCs examine ) whether increase subsequent diagnosis PHC patient co-morbid mental health chronic disease diagnose b ) whether patient likely enter remain treatment , compare standard PHC-based screening . 2 . Implement evaluate effect provide staff train collaborative care model integrate mental health ( depression , anxiety ) cardiovascular disease ( hypertension , diabetes , CVD ) intervention PHC staff compare control PHC staff respect ) knowledge clinical skill use clinical patient vignette , b ) perceive satisfaction report clinic patient intervention control PHCs . 3 . Implement evaluate effect , multi-level integrated clinic community-based intervention co-morbid primary care patient compare enhanced standard non-integrated treatment service cRCT 50 participate PHC , regard mental health ( depression anxiety ) physical health ( diabetes cardiovascular disease ) outcomes post intervention , 6 month 12 month follow .</detailed_description>
