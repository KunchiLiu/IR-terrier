	<brief_summary>Impairment arm function common low limb impairment stroke patient also resistant treatment . Several clinical trial stroke patient produce statistically significant gain upper limb function use instrumental playing treatment rhythm support prim timing movement . Based positive result control non-controlled trial , Cochrane review music therapy acquire brain injury ( Bradt , et al. , 2010 ) recommend investigation rhythm base technique treat hemiparesis stroke patient , future study need examine relationship frequency duration intervention treatment effect . The aim study examine whether thirty minute , twice weekly , six week , home music therapy treatment , play set musical pattern instrument music feasible deliver , lead improve coordination , dexterity activity daily live hemiparetic stroke patient . Twelve patient recruited Cambridgeshire Community Services NHS trust ( CCS ) one month two year post stroke hemiparesis . Participants complete discharged community rehabilitation upper limb receive treatment arm function . They randomise two group : treatment ( immediate treatment follow discharge community rehab ) wait list ( begin 9 week baseline measure ) . Participants assess begin end treatment ( start complete 6 week treatment ) one two experience community occupational therapist contract CCS , also experience work stroke patient blind experiment . The three measure conduct chief investigator . The assessment tool Action Research Arm Test ( ARAT ) nine hole peg test ( 9HPT ) . There also pre post treatment semi-structured interview participant , conduct chief investigator . ARAT 9HPT assessment administer participant time point : baseline week 6 , 9 , 15 18 . Data analyse determine treatment effective compare treatment ( wait list ) follow community discharge , whether early intervention ( treatment group ) yield good result participant , eventually receive treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Music Therapy The Rehabilitation Upper Limb With Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CROSSOVER DESIGN After stroke patient finish upper limb rehabilitation CCS longer receive physiotherapy occupational therapy improve , study aim establish upper limb function maintain , deteriorates , improves . In order investigator wait list group wait 9 week end CCS rehabilitation assess time point baseline measure treatment group . This enable u compare result treatment group wait list group , word 'treatment compare treatment CCS rehab end ' , establish music therapy effective . The investigator also compare result group determine participant receive music therapy earlier perform differently wait list group . The five repeat measure use ARAT 9HPT also allow participant measure , compare treatment treatment establish exercise use musical instrument ( TIMP treatment ) influence paretic arm use activity daily live . STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES The study goal investigate feasibility deliver music therapy treatment stroke patient ' home twice week six week objective answer primary research question , : 1 . Does TIMP improve upper limb function statutory rehabilitation cease effective consequently end ? The Secondary objective try determine : 2 . Is TIMP effective deliver immediately statutory rehabilitation end compare 9 week later ? 3 . How participant experience TIMP ? STUDY DESIGN In order answer research question wait list , crossover design use , twelve participant randomly assign two group : A = treatment B = wait list Randomisation achieve use envelope system , twelve seal envelope contain folded piece paper , six word 'treatment ' six word 'wait list ' write . Each time patient consent participation , chief investigator contact statistician ask open envelope read piece paper inside . There enormous variability patient term speed recovery follow stroke inclusion criterion 'time since stroke ' quite broad . There clear data fully confirm difference degree upper limb paresis base type site stroke type site include . Inclusion criterion study follow : 1 . Can consent treatment 2. age 18-70 3. complete community rehabilitation upper limb paresis 4. type site stroke 5. 1 month 2 year post stroke 6. lift paretic hand onto table whilst seat , without assistance unaffected hand 7. finger movement , could extension one finger 8. receive treatment upper limb paresis course study ( 18 week baseline measure ) Once treatment begin , participant receive two , thirty minute music therapy session per week six week . All participant eventually receive treatment . Group A begin music therapy immediately complete baseline assessment use ARAT 9HPT complete semi-structured interview . This mean first session require approximately two hour order allow set equipment break participant . In event participant tire follow assessment continue treatment , music therapy session reschedule another day week . The end measure also take place day twelfth final session participant tire complete end assessment reschedule another day week . METHODOLOGY RECRUITMENT Patients complete CCS community occupational physiotherapy rehabilitation send letter invitation participate study information sheet ( see attach 'Letter Invitation ' 'participant information sheet ' ) . In letter ask contact chief investigator interested participating , explain answer question participation arrange visit home order demonstrate exercise . Then , interested chief investigator leave consent form sign return within week . RANDOMISATION Once participant give informed consent , chief investigator contact statistician ( Mike Parker , medical statistician , Anglia University , Chelmsford ) ask open one 12 envelope , either 'treatment ' 'waiting list ' write piece paper inside indicate group participant go . ASSESSMENTS The primary outcome measure Action Research Arm Test ( Lyle 1981 . See diagram 12 'Appendix ' ) , use similar study ( Schneider ; 2007 , Altenmueller ; 2009 , Grau-Sanchez ; 2013 ) thus enable comparison data study . It 19 item measure divide four category : grasp , grip , pinch gross movement . Each item , action , perform participant seat measure distance table ( 15cm ) , assessment item place ( block wood various size , small item , etc ) . The test recreate movement sequence movement common activity daily live , reach onto shelf pick soup . A table map ARAT lay flat table top marker indicate start end position object use test , thus optimise consistency patient set . The performance task time use stopwatch , score accord standardise scale . The assessment take 30 minute patient need complete item every subcategory , rare . The test usually take approximately 10 minute . The secondary outcome measure 9 hole peg test ( Kellor et al , 1971 ) . This test Cambridgeshire Community Services team ( host study ) use . It time test measuring finger dexterity use standardised equipment comprise rectangular plastic tray round , concave tray one end contain nine small white pegs end nine hole participant must ( one time ) place nine peg tray remove , place back tray quickly possible . The patient practice unaffected hand first , paretic side . The patient seat perform test . A non-slip mat place base peg test table surface . The participant may stabilise test base necessary use unaffected hand . The test take 2 minute administer , depend age patient exist degree finger dexterity . SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW Before begin music therapy treatment participant ask set question score much think improve paretic arm use activity daily live . At end treatment participant ask question . The chief investigator write response interview later thematic analysis . Interviews record . Questions use open possible give participant opportunity express preconception thought . Each question may lead question , example question 1 may prompt response ' I think help '' chief investigator may respond `` might help ? '' The purpose semi-structured interview gather qualitative data specifically regard participant experience treatment . The pre post question set .</detailed_description>
