	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend expansion dose ( RED ) ASP2215 concomitant cytarabine/idarubicin induction chemotherapy base status onset dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) . Safety tolerability ASP2215 also evaluate . This study also characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter ASP2215 concomitant induction consolidation chemotherapy well evaluate PK parameter cytarabine concomitant ASP2215 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study ASP2215 Combination With Induction Consolidation Chemotherapy Japanese Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study compose dose-evaluation part expansion part . In dose-evaluation part , least 3 subject receive ASP2215 dose ( low , middle , high ) determination MTD and/or RED . Treatment AML study compose 3 period therapy : remission induction , consolidation , maintenance . The decision whether proceed next dose make base occurrence DLT Cycle 1 induction period . In expansion part , maximum 3 subject receive ASP2215 RED recommend dose-evaluation part safety assess base onset DLTs Cycle 1 induction consolidation period .</detailed_description>
