	<brief_title>PICTURE Breast XS : Patient Information Combined Local Therapy oUtcome Assessment bREast Cancer - Cross-sectional</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common cancer affect woman Europe , lifetime risk 1 9 . It increasingly treatable disease , 10-year survival exceed 80 % . The primary treatment breast cancer surgery , may use conjunction adjuvant therapy , chemotherapy radiotherapy . Given high breast cancer survival rate , many woman live many year potentially disfigure aesthetic consequence surgical therapeutic treatment . A good aesthetic outcome important endpoint breast cancer treatment closely related psychosocial recovery quality life . When woman face breast cancer diagnosis , surgery propose , several option available . The decision type surgery offer patient largely subjective base almost exclusively judgment experience clinician . The cosmetic outcome surgery function many factor include tumour size location , volume breast , density , dose distribution radiotherapy . In breast-conserving surgery , evidence approximately 30 % woman receive suboptimal poor aesthetic outcome ; however currently standardise method identify woman . The PICTURE project aim address issue provide objective tool , tailor individual patient , predict aesthetic outcome local treatment . Using combination 3D photography routinely acquire radiological image ( i.e . mammography , ultrasound MRI , available ) , together information tumour ( size , location , shape etc . ) develop technique biomechanically model anatomy breast effect surgical removal cancerous tissue . This digital patient representation associate predictive tool enable alternative surgical strategy explore consequence available option , respect appearance breast , visualise . This aid communication patient type breast surgery recommend surgeon , empower patient take active role share decision make process . The study develop tool enable patient 's aesthetic appearance treatment objectively evaluate . Current technique use subjective method , assessment expert panel , computer analysis 2-dimensional photography estimate , instance , breast asymmetry . By adopt recent development low cost 3D photography depth sense technology , develop standardise , reproducible analysis tool base aesthetic outcome evaluation 3-dimensional shape reconstruct breast volume . This establish standardised quality assurance evaluation procedure , enable institution across Europe compare factor positive negative impact surgical outcome identify . In summary , demonstrator create PICTURE project integrate model surgical technique treatment scheme , clinical patient data , multi-modal imaging individualised model patient anatomy build personalise , digital representation patient . The aim use aid surgical planning , via simulation cosmetic effect breast conserve surgery , decision support tool communicate available option patient enable standardised evaluation safe outcome procedure . The demonstrator aim empower patient direct impact care quality life .</detailed_description>
