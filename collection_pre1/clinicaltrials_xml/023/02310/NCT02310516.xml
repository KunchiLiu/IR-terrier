	<brief_summary>The brain awake surgery recently boom neurosurgical oncology also epilepsy surgery . The goal awake surgery allow precise localization sensorimotor function , language cognitive good respect . Indeed , interindividual anatomo-functional variation , lack specificity functional exploration radiological magnetic nuclear , well reorganization area involve function ( mechanisms brain plasticity ) epileptic patient patient cerebral tumor allow identify preoperatively . Brain awake surgery allow analysis precise real-time identification area network involve function direct electrical stimulation ( inhibitory activatory ) . Thus , surgical technique become gold standard surgery brain lesion locate functional area . However , although brain awake surgery practice since many year , confidentiality information recent year explain probably little data available personal experience procedure patient . Studies analyze perception patient satisfaction patient surgery awake condition retrospective include patient . The investigator experience live surgery investigator develop investigator team since four year whole awake surgery well tolerate adequate explanation provide preoperatively minimum preoperative precaution observe . Thus , investigator decide develop preoperative device could improve personal experience well-being patient undergo surgical approach .</brief_summary>
