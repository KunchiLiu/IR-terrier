	<brief_summary>Blast-related blunt traumatic brain injury key priority area Rehabilitation Research &amp; Development ( RR &amp; D ) represent critically important public health problem face Veteran population . Developing efficacious treatment persistent memory deficit see population key step reduce impact problem everyday life Veterans . Memory problem TBI Veterans quite heterogeneous , efficacy likely maximized develop disseminate multiple alternative treatment individually match Veteran 's key deficit , research seek understand cognitive neural basis treatment-related change time . The result approach may aid clinical decision make assignment patient rehabilitative treatment likely improve memory capacity functional outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Memory dysfunction result impairment along continuum information processing , poor initial acquisition information learn disturbed retrieval store memory later need perform task1 . The heterogeneous nature TBI-related memory impairment well-known , critical need good understand disease heterogeneity order enhance diagnosis therapeutic management2 . Several subtypes memory dysfunction TBI identified3,4 . First , TBI survivor exhibit impaired memory acquisition/encoding ( e.g. , frontal system damage ) 5 . Second , exhibit impaired memory consolidation/storage impairment ( e.g. , prominent damage temporal lobe systems6 ) . Third , show impairment retrieval information5,7 . This heterogeneity result variable nature severity underlie brain trauma result unpredictable mechanical forces2,8 . It suggest parse underlying variability take precedence generality regard effect TBI memory conceptualize treat memory disorder population8 Nevertheless , many rehabilitation program utilize `` one size fit '' approach memory training , base ( typically ) train compensatory strategy , train specifically target identifiable component process memory could differentially impair ( encode , consolidation/storage , retrieval ) , might respond differentially specifically targeted treatment . This situation clinical practice due lack evidence upon base inform decision-making allocate specifically targeted memory re-training individual survivor TBI , base clinical test result identify memory component process impaired ( encode , consolidation/storage , retrieval ) . Because , little attempt appropriately match patient impairment target treatment . There exist training protocol train three component memory processing , follow : encoding ( memory strategy training9 ) , consolidation ( errorless learning10 ) , retrieval ( retrieval practice11 , efficacy test TBI survivor document impairment component . That , investigator ' knowledge , solid evidence memory training TBI survivor support widely hold belief specifically matching patient impairment treatment lead well treatment outcomes . This proposal attempt fill gap investigator ' knowledge . Prior test efficacy three type train large trial , important make standard preparation , refine test training material ensure fidelity treatment method across clinician . Aim 1 . Aim 1 refine validate three separate , process-specific memory rehabilitation treatment focus improve information-processing encoding , consolidation , retrieval stage Veterans chronic moderate/severe TBI . Objective 1.1 . Generate treatment manual three process-specific memory treatment . Objective 1.2 . Test refine treatment fidelity three intervention reliably deliver different clinician . Aim 2 . Aim 2 provide preliminary test response three memory intervention . At baseline , TBI survivor evaluate memory function three memory component process use establish neuropsychometric method . Their experimental treatment allocation treatment target impaired memory component . In addition , subject serve his/her control , engage treatment target another memory component ( 'mismatched ' group ) . Hypothesis A . Matched vs. mismatch group show differential improvement memory component function , former group benefit significantly great degree . ( Primary measure : Memory component performance , encode , consolidation , retrieval ; secondary : cognitive function quality life ) . Aim 3 . Aim 3 establish link behavioral taxonomy three memory component difference brain structure function document diffusion tensor image functional connectivity analysis . This key first step establish brain-based metric neuroplastic change memory therapy investigator ' research program . Objective 3.1 . Identify specific unique imaging signature distinguish patient deficit encode , consolidation , retrieval , respectively . Primary measure : structural measure morphometry white matter integrity ( FA ) functional connectivity ( cross correlation total interdependence ) identify brain network damage TBI . Clinical Implications . This research potential devise method match specific subcomponents memory impairment specifically targeted memory intervention , thus maximize recovery memory function . The result investigation use refine intervention , evaluate cognitive functional endpoint , power large clinical trial yield data enable clinician match TBI patient effective treatment base individual profile memory dysfunction .</detailed_description>
