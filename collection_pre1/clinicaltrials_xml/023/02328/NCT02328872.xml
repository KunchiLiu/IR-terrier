	<detailed_description>Compass randomise control trial primary HPV test cervical cancer screen versus cytology screen Australia . A pilot study involve 5,000 woman carry 2013-2014 . The main trial involve recruit 121,000 woman primary health clinic . Women age 25-69 , attend cervical screen routine follow-up invited participate 2-arm trial . A liquid-based cytology ( LBC ) sample take consent woman send VCS Pathology . On receipt woman 's first Compass sample VCS Pathology randomise 1:2 parallel group allocation LBC HPV arm use randomisation minimisation procedure , stratification birth cohort accord whether offer HPV vaccination Australia 's national publicly-funded HPV vaccination program ( date birth &gt; =July 1st 1980 DOB &lt; 1st July 1980 ) . The screening management algorithms two study arm follow : Active control ( LBC ) Arm : 2.5 yearly image-read cytology screen reflex HPV triage test low grade cytology . Intervention ( HPV ) Arm : 5 yearly HPV screen potentially oncogenic type partial genotyping enable separate identification HPV16 HPV18 referral group diagnostic evaluation , secondary randomisation `` intermediate risk '' woman test positive oncogenic HPV ( HPV 16 18 ) either image read LBC screen dual-stained ( DS ) cytology test p16/Ki67 . The laboratory report issue practitioner specify recommended management woman , accord study arm test result . Participating woman flag Victorian Cervical Cytology Registry ( VCCR ) invitation letter issue registry 3 month prior designated time re-screening follow-up . Clinical outcome ( screen test , colposcopy histology result ) track via VCCR . Data linkage VCCR National HPV Vaccination Program Register perform order integrate vaccination screen history trial participant . Participants follow anticipated 5 year time recruitment . Previous trial unvaccinated population demonstrate increased detection CIN2+ HPV-screened ( co-tested ) woman vs. cytology-alone screened woman baseline screen round , follow decrease rate incident CIN3+ HPV-screened vs. Pap screen woman thereafter . This potentially reflect ( ) increase detection disease CIN2 ( treatment ) threshold baseline HPV-screened woman , lead increase prevention future CIN3 group woman treat CIN2 baseline ; ( ii ) association , demonstrate multiple cohort study , HPV positivity ( especially type 16/18 ) development CIN3+ future . In Compass trial , HPV-positive woman without verified disease baseline undergo increase surveillance test HPV negative . A total 33,000 woman birth cohort offer vaccination 77,000 woman cohort offer vaccination , present routine screening , recruit , along additional woman bring total number recruit 121,000 ( additional woman represent present routine follow-up recruit safety monitoring sample ) . The sample size requirement trial base assessment cumulative proportion CIN3+ ( include CIN3 invasive cervical cancer ) woman screen-negative baseline . A major impact study value extend screening interval patient screen-negative baseline . Logistically , would difficult randomise patient baseline screening , cumulative 5-year CIN3+ rate baseline screen-negative patient may longer strictly comparative . However , critical scientific question trial power secondary outcome : cumulative proportion CIN3+ ( include CIN3 invasive cervical cancer ) screen-negative woman , adjust censor CIN2+ treatment . The primary outcome base total cumulative detection CIN3+ . Because primary outcome include precancer , remain potential benefit early detection baseline screen round , although benefit explicitly factor primary outcome highlight assessment outcome baseline screen-negative woman ( i.e . analysis Secondary Outcome 1 ) . When assess total cumulative rate CIN3+ , include baseline round longitudinal follow-up arm , follow-up duration critical determinant expect relative outcome CIN3+ two arm compare . A second critical determinant disease ascertainment process trial exit , consistent process use sensitive screen test follow equivalent referral management process must perform arm . Therefore woman enrol Compass offer HPV exit test 5 year ( since expect standard care Australia cervical screening 2016 , HPV exit test also act routine cervical screen test ) . A Scientific Advisory Committee advise investigator team issue relate protocol , operation issue bring investigator Committee . An Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( IDSMC ) configure monitor safety participant trial . Compass sponsor Victorian Cytology Service ( VCS ) , government-funded health promotion charity . The VCS receive equipment fund contribution Compass trial Roche Molecular Systems Ventana Inc USA .</detailed_description>
