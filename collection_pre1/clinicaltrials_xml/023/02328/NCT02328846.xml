	<detailed_description>There increase evidence despite resuscitation normalization macrohemodynamic parameter ( blood pressure cardiac output ) significant dysfunction microcirculation may persist.1 , 2 There also positive correlation severity microcirculatory dysfunction outcome patient septic shock . In contrast , early improvement microcirculatory perfusion response macrohemodynamic goal direct therapy associate improvement organ function.3 Monitoring microcirculation challenge . The monitoring window ( e.g . sublingual bed ) must reflective remote vascular bed . This likely case set systemic disease sepsis hypovolemic shock . Current research modality study microcirculation include laser Doppler videomicroscopy.4 The limitation device assessment microcirculation perform off-line target microvascular resuscitation establish . Therefore , microvascular monitoring currently restrict research arena . Evaluation tissue transcutaneous carbon dioxide ( PtC02 ) novel , non-invasive , real-time method assess microcirculation.5 , 6 The three major determinant PtC02 arterial carbon dioxide ( PaCO2 ) , oxygen consumption ( VCO2 ) tissue blood flow . Under normal condition , increase tissue metabolism ( thus VCO2 ) couple increase tissue perfusion , largely reduce PtC02 increase ( `` washout '' phenomenon ) . Therefore , PaCO2 constant , increase PtC02 reflect inadequate relationship metabolism tissue perfusion . PtC02 thus represent good estimate tissue perfusion . To overcome influence PaCO2 PtC02 , convenient use carbon dioxide gap ( tissue-arterial carbon dioxide gradient , normal &lt; 7 mmHg ) . Very high gap value may addition suggest presence tissue hypoxia moderately elevate gap may represent either flow stagnation tissue hypoxia . Cardiac surgery characterize significant alteration microvascular circulation . These change observe on-pump off-pump case pulsatile non-pulsatile flow . Monitoring PtC02-arterial CO2 gradient offer rapid real-time measure microvascular abnormality encounter post-cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) period effect post-CPB organ dysfunction .</detailed_description>
