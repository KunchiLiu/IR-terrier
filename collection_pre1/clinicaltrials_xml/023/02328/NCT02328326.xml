Methods : This randomize controlled trial evaluate intervention ( Caring Others Increasing EngageMent PACT , CO-IMPACT ) design structure facilitate health supporter involvement PACT patient become actively engage PACT care . 240 patient diabetes receive PACT primary care : 1 ) high risk diabetes complication due hyperglycemia OR high blood pressure 2 ) health supporter involve care recruit along health supporter . Patient-supporter dyad randomize CO-IMPACT intervention usual PACT care high-risk diabetes , 12 month . The intervention provide patient-supporter dyad : one coaching session action planning , communicate provider , navigation skill support skill ; preparation phone patient ' primary care visit ; after-visit summary mail ; biweekly automate phone call prompt action new patient health concern .
