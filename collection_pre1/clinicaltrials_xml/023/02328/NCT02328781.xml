	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Safety Efficacy Vertebral Drug-eluting Stent System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial utilizes prospective , multicenter , single-arm target value trial design , evaluate safety efficacy Firehorus vertebral artery rapamycin-target-eluting stent system ( hereinafter refer Firehorus ) clinical use , 5 ( ) institution select Clinical Trial Centre.Subjects screen accordance inclusion exclusion criterion protocol treat Firehorus . Immediate stent implantation success rate subject surgery record , DSA angiographic follow-up perform six month ( ±30 day ) surgery ass incidence stent restenosis ( stenosis ≥ 50 % ) subject , subject follow 30 day ( ±7 day ) , 6 month ( ± 30 day ) , 12 month ( ± 30 day ) surgery long-term clinical follow-up , evaluate safety efficacy Firehorus clinical use . The expected participate duration subject enrollment complete follow-up 12 month ( ± 30 day ) .</detailed_description>
