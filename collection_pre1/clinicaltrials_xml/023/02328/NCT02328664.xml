	<brief_title>SCar-biopsies After Malignant Colorectal Polypectomy Uncertain RAdicality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : colorectal polyp may harbor adenocarcinoma . Numbers increase due nationwide colorectal screening program . After endoscopic removal , rescue surgery often perform radicality guarantee pathologist . However , 85 % surgical specimen residual malignancy find . Given morbidity mortality associate surgery method diagnose residual cancer need . Biopsies polypectomy site variably use reduce likelihood residual tumor polypectomy site circumstance . However , sensitivity biopsy unknown . Objective : evaluate sensitivity second-look endoscopic biopsy polypectomy site residual tumor . Study design : prospective cross-sectional design use multi-center approach . Study population : patient plan rescue surgery sole reason ( potentially ) irradical endoscopic resection colorectal adenocarcinoma without poor differentiation , lymphovascular invasion tumor bud without sign dissemination . Intervention : endoscopic biopsy polypectomy site operation . Main study parameters/endpoints : sensitivity second-look biopsy polypectomy site residual tumor resect bowel postoperative mortality . Various factor assess might associate residual cancer . Nature extent burden risk associate participation benefit : Depending situation : ) : In case tattoo need do polypectomy site , second endoscopy do anyway take biopsy ( painless ) extra burden ; b ) : In case tattoo need do sigmoidoscopy ( lesion distal splenic flexure ) colonoscopy ( proximal splenic flexure ) need arrange purpose study . A sigmoidoscopy take 10-20 minute . Preparation consist two enema . A colonoscopy take 20-30 minute . Preparation consist drink 3 litre MoviPrep® , usually doe home . Notice patient recent experience colonoscopy . If necessary , investigation arrange conscious sedation ( rule colonoscopy ) , also imply day-care admission . The risk complication second endoscopy estimate &lt; 1:5000 . The benefit 2nd colonoscopy discovery new polyps 10-25 % case .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged 18 . Endoscopically remove colorectal lesion follow pathological characteristic : A moderatelytowell differentiate adenocarcinoma . If possible judge : distance adenocarcinoma vertical lateral resection margin le 1 mm . In case piecemeal resection : unjudgeable radicality ( mostly due loss orientation multiple fragment ) . Absence / unjudgeable lymphatic / vascular invasion . No grade I tumor bud . No suspicion dissemination follow investigation : serum carcinoembryonic antigen , computer tomographic ( CT ) scan abdomen chest Xray ; case rectal tumor ( le 15 cm anal verge ) : additional magnetic resonance imaging rectum . Operation advise agreement Dutch Guideline Colorectal cancer , plan agree patient . Written inform consent obtain . Pathology show one follow characteristic : A radical enbloc resection free vertical lateral margin ≧ 1 mm . A poorly differentiate signetcell contain adenocarcinoma . Lymphatic vascular invasion ( feature unjudgeable due piecemeal resection , exclusion do ) . Tumor bud grade IIIII . Suspicion dissemination investigation mention inclusion criterion . Patients already receive antitumor treatment another tumor synchronic colorectal cancer . Patients secondlook endoscopy would require major unacceptable effort / resource , instance clinical admission bowel preparation , long travel , general anesthesia , extremely difficult reach polypectomy site . Such decision patient / treat physician . Patient plan transanal surgery . Patient plan surgery . Patient pregnant . Patient provide write informed consent unable provide .</criteria>
