	<detailed_description>The Buckypaper ( BP ) innovative material attract attention many research group engage study possible application various technological field preliminary human experimentation . In fact experimentation , preliminary conduct animal model , applicable human , result term toxicity durability comfortable . The interesting material property , good mechanical strength , electrical conductivity , low density , porosity adaptable , closely associate intrinsic characteristic carbon nanotube ( CNTs ) , BP make . The high surface development CNT , addition promote aggregation , allow preparation micro-and nano-porous membrane exclude passage colloidal particles diameter great 50 nm . The microporous structure , also give BP high capacity absorb liquid , water , effect capillarity , penetrate quickly mesh material . This could possible interpretation rapid effective adhesion BP biological tissue observe study effect material implanted vivo . The bioadhesion BP document ex vivo experiment mechanical peeling ( bench surgery ) , conduct advance use substrate , guinea pig , rat , abdominal muscle fascia rabbit . The result show force require post BP organic support much great required conventional prosthesis make polymer network , commonly use hernia surgery fix glue biological prosthetic material bioadhesive synthetic currently market . Based assessment base potential offer use BP field prosthetic surgery , deductible intrinsic characteristic material project expect research development new generation prosthetic material use surgical -based BP , easily implantable surgeon without need suture , graph / biological glue . The reason : 1. stitch : could tighten knot vessel ( ischemia-atrophy ) nerve ( chronic pain ) ; 2. graph : placing blind cause bleed pain ; 3. biological glue : derive plasma donor thus could transmit disease unknown . It still unknown BP appropriate mechanical property withstand stress occur abdominal wall In case document good bio-adhesion living tissue anatomical preparation , make humid . For reason decide prepare composite material BP/polypropylene . Such material , define `` coupled '' , obtain adhere smooth face BP , polymeric support confers hybrid film , correct mechanical resistance . Such system may subject change . Indeed , exploit functional group present introduced crystalline structure MWCNTs and/or polymer , possible implant muscle/muscular fascia surface , composite material , obtain grip . Moreover , biologically active molecule , function antimicrobial , anti-adhesive , anti-inflammatory analgesic , introduce crystalline structure MWCNTs , modulate inflammatory response incorporation implant material fibrous scar . The objective project obtain result direct search ultimate realization prosthetic device use abdominal surgery appliable human . Our Research Group propose present research program skill achieve objective . It bring together researcher proven expertise experience various field General Surgery Prosthetic Surgery abdominal wall Experienced scientist Materials Science especially polymeric nature , also biomedical us , Organic Chemistry , synthesis bio-conjugates development slow release system drug , characterization biological system technique nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) . The surgeon unit search , fact , many year engage resolution issue related surgical technique , assessment effect live organism conventional prosthetic material innovative one , propose project , include vivo testing , conduct accord protocol specially prepared approve Ministry Health . The protocol drawn respect environmental policy , ethical principle experimentation animal model , accordance guideline European Union ( 86/609/EEC-European Economic Community ) , Italian Law nÂ° 116/92 . Will conduct systematic experiment 30 New Zealand female rabbit ( R1-R30 ) , weight 3000 g ( Harlan Laboratories ) . The `` vivo '' investigation biocompatibility adhesion BP abdominal scar perform intervention incisional hernia plastic surgery inguinal hernia . The biocompatibility BP investigate mean blood chemistry test . Blood sample 3 ml whole blood run every beast induction general anaesthesia , ear vein , surgery prosthetic implant , prior euthanasia indicate Time schedule . Methodology technique experiment : These experiment preliminar human use perform general anesthesia endotracheal intubation , hair removal , disinfection preparation surgical field . A midline incision 10 cm navel-pubis perform , splay skin subcutaneous layer , incise fascia plane , muscle deep enter peritoneum sac . The execution blood sample coincident detection body weight execution ultrasound abdominal region study implant site search sign sepsis incisional hernia . We implant kind new matherials human try study tollerability toxicity animal model drawn : ten rabbit ( hereafter define BPR1-BPR10 ) ( Buckypaper Rabbit subject 1 10 ) receive 2x2cm2 sample BP ( Buckypaper ) ten rabbit receive 2x2cm2 sample PR ( polypropylene ) ( PRR11-PRR20 ) pocket create muscular fascia large muscle abdominal wall . In five rabbit ( BPR21-BPR25 ) , surgical incision carry abdominal linea alba perform deeply , enter abdominal cavity . The control group ( R26-R30 ) undergo surgery . A 2x2cm2 BP sample insert rough side face parietal peritoneum surface smooth brilliant surface face visceral peritoneum ( BPR21-BPR25 ) . Five rabbit ( R26-R30 ) operate used control group . The animal monitor controlled daily , entire studied period , order continually assess state health , body weight . At 35th day pick blood sample examination . Finally animal sacrifice general anesthesia . The case BPR1-BPR10 ( group A ) compare PRR11-PRR20 ( control group B ) compare effect implant BP size Parietene already use reconstructive surgery healthy man . After intervention , last 60 minute time induction , animal slowly awaken bring back room housing . At time sacrifice prepare anatomic sample viscera implantation site , study histologically . Histopathological sample microscopic examination prepare . Portions BP implant BPR 1-BPR 10 excise surround fascia , dermal muscular tissue . The procedure perform , also PRR 11-PRR 20 group BPR 21-BPR 25 group . The sample fix 10 % buffered formalin , cut stain Haematoxylin Eosin ( H &amp; E ) histological observation . The post-operative pain , human , mild , treat analgesic accord technique standardize human . In experience , animal undergo prosthetic surgery , experimental control group , treat prophylactic antibiotic pain medication immediate post -operative , closely watch . Even animal model , sterility surgical procedure prevents inflammation , edema sepsis abscesses ensure low level postoperative pain . The day surgical procedure expect moderate appetite operate animal mild clinical symptom relate post-operative . All treated animal observe daily carefully control amount food consume thus potential loss appetite . Will look evidence possible inflammatory degenerative process affect skin abdominal wall , symptom infection rejection prosthesis . If weight loss excessive ( eg 10 % normal weight animal race , age comparison control group ) , animal show clinical symptom suffer normal postoperative , subject general anesthesia delete . The analgesic antibiotic therapy perform postoperative period follow : Antibiotic : enrofloxacin 2.5 mg /kg /day I.M . 5-7 day ; anti-inflammatory analgesic : ketoprofen , Findol 10 % , 0.3 ml/10kg/die i.m . 3-5 day . If necessary give also tramadol , 2-4 mg /kg/day first 2 /3 day post-intervention . The surgical wound check daily . The clinical-chemical parameter examine blood sample 3 ml : BUN ( Blood Urea Nitrogen ) , blood glucose , creatinine , sodium , potassium , calcium , magnesium , albumin , total proteinemia Blood protein level , SGOT ( Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase ) , SGPT ( Serum Glutamic PyruvateTransaminase ) , GGT ( gamma glutamyl transferase ) , ALP ( alkaline phosphatase ) fractionate bilirubin , PT ( Prothrombin Time ) , APTT/PTT ( Activated partial thromboplastin time ) , Fibrinogen , CBC ( Complete Blood Count ) formula , lymphocyte subpopulation , C-reactive protein , erythrocyte sedimentation rate . Will perform ultrasound examination evaluate morphologically prosthesis ' incorporation , formation seroma , bruise , abscess . This procedure perform sedation follow body weight check pick-up blood sample . The procedure repeat twice intervention 35 day sacrifice .</detailed_description>
