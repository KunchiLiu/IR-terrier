	<detailed_description>Overall objectives Our primary objective determine four intervention improve smoke cessation rate beneficiary Vitalilty/Discovery program . The investigator plan compare effectiveness standard intervention ( control ) include text messaging aim encouraging cessation four intervention : 1 ) choice free ( traditional ) cessation aid ( NRT : gum patch ) , 2 ) free e-cigarettes , 3 ) Choice free cessation aid ( NRT e-cigarettes ) reward base incentive cessation , 4 ) Choice free cessation aid ( NRT e-cigarettes ) virtual deposit-based incentive cessation . Primary outcome variable : Urine cotinine , anabasine , blood carboxyhemoglobin test ( metabolite nicotine ) 6 month follow quit date . Secondary outcome variable : Urine cotinine , anabasine , blood carboxyhemoglobin test ( metabolite nicotine ) 1 month , 3 month , 12 month follow quit date . Background Tobacco use remain one preventable cause disease , disability , death worldwide ( CDC , 2014 ) . Rates smoke US decrease 18.1 % 2012 remain far cessation goal set tobacco prevention organization ( 12 % 2020 US ) . To achieve cessation goal reduce harm tobacco , investigator need implement proven strategy promote cessation develop new approach increase tobacco cessation ( Frieden , 2014 ) . Vitality wellness program 25 company US . They charge provide variety wellness program employee company represent . These program span variety health behavior include tobacco use , obesity , healthy eating , drive texting many . Financial incentive effective improve health variety area , include smoke cessation ( Heil et al. , 2008 ; Loewenstein et al. , 2012 ; Lynagh et al. , 2013 ; Sutherland et al. , 2008 ; Volpp et al. , 2009 ) . In large ( n = 878 ) successful trial , Volpp colleague ( 2009 ) find financial incentive , total $ 750 , increase long-term smoking cessation rate 5.0 % control group 14.7 % incentive group 12 month quit . Following period 6 month incentive discontinue difference group remain intact , support use incentive sustainable cessation effort . Strong evidence support use incentive smoke cessation allowance grant Affordable Care Act employer use 30 % total premium outcomes-based reward penalty lead increase use financial incentive employer . An estimated 82 % large employer 2013 use financial incentive promote healthy behavior ( Volpp , 2014 ) . While financial incentive show improve rate healthy behavior , basic research behavioral economics suggest pay incentive may critical . Behavioral economics suggest loss aversion may promote behavior change reward-based incentive . Whether hold true large employer base population participant auto-enrolled yet determine . The investigator propose conduct 5- arm study examine use different financial incentive structure new technology promote smoke cessation Vitality member US . The relative effectiveness incentive pay unknown . To shed light fundamental question investigator examine incentive assistance quit compare incentive deliver evidence smoking abstinence deposit contract . Additionally utility e-cigarettes promote abstinence well understood . The use e-cigarettes smoking cessation tool promote provide across experimental arm effectiveness aide also evaluate . The primary objective identify difference long-term abstinence rate . Secondary objective include assess sustain abstinence follow-up . An opt-out enrollment procedure use study . All participant previously test positive cotinine report smoker , 18 year age old , beneficiary Vitality , opportunity terminate participation time . Employing opt-out design trial help connect high-risk smoker , largely interested change behavior , potentially helpful treatment may otherwise seek . Below describe many reason opt-out enrollment appropriate trial . 1 ) An opt-out design essential answer question interested : rate sustain smoke abstinence might insurer expect generate actually roll intervention test among beneficiary , intervention compare term effectiveness ? Thus , design trial , explicitly aim mimic roll health initiative real-world setting ; opt-out consent , whereby beneficiary engage program unless actively choose otherwise , program would roll real world . As program similar current trial develop disseminate across country imperative examine intervention perform condition . Enrolling large number smoker study offer form assistance cessation provide high expect benefit , enrol participant term knowledge gain . While smoke rate reduce 18 % United States , smoke related illness still remain leading cause preventable death United States . More 75 % current American smoker wish quit ; 45 % quit least day year ; anti-smoking policy , new pharmaceutical , behavioral modification program offer promise help . Nevertheless , 2-3 % smoker attain prolonged abstinence annually . Given high interest quit smoking , low rate successfully sustain quit attempt currently available program , opt-out consent ensure smoker access potentially helpful program without add barrier complete lengthy enrollment/consent process . Vitality commit use effective mean reduce major risk health membership employee base . In order achieve goal work innovative researcher University Pennsylvania Center Health Incentives Behavioral Economics ( CHIBE ) . Within Vitality US population 13 % member test positive tobacco use . In South African Vitality employee population smoke prevalence estimate 22 % . Vitality launch study tobacco cessation use incentive new nicotine technology member US . Findings study publish use development smoke cessation program offering Vitality . If successful trial could serve model organization interested implementing similar program . This study use National Institute Aging support Way Health technology ( RC2-AG036592 ) use many previous study nature . As outlined Appendix , web-based behavioral research infrastructure substantially increase efficiency patient enrollment tracking , data management , incentive collection disbursement , thereby enable much large study possible previously . Participants eligible trial previously identify Vitality/Discovery group various assessment conduct . All meet minimum eligibility requirement ( 18 year old , smoke least 5 cigarette day , test positive cotinine previous health screen ) automatically enrol study randomize one four experimental arm control arm . All participant enrol day . Furthermore , participant give quit date , date one month enrollment . This program require participant indicate smoking status provide sample verification abstinence pre-determined date quit date ( 1 month , 3 month , 6 month 12 month post quit date ) . Participants report successfully quit ask undergo urine cotinine anabasine test 1 month , 3 months,6 month , 12 month follow quit date . Cotinine use determine abstinence participant report use NRT ecigarettes . Anabasine use determine abstinence participant report use NRT ecigarettes , cotinine test distinguish cigarette nicotine replacement therapy nicotine . Participants test positive cotinine anabasine report use e-cigarettes tobacco product ask submit secondary test determine abstinence . This test blood carboxyhemoglobin test . Control Arm : Participants randomize arm receive standardized Vitality program aim promote tobacco cessation . This program include exist employee benefit quit use text/email message encourage tobacco cessation . No incentive give participant randomized arm . Free cessation aid available participant arm . They receive compensation complete study related activity ( sample submission ) . E-cigarette arm ( Arm 2 ) : Participants randomize experimental arm receive standardize program include text/email message access free e-cigarettes . These product order directly , free charge , web-based interface . No incentive give participant randomized arm . They receive compensation complete study related activity ( sample submission ) . E-cigarette/NRT/Zyban/Chantix Choice arm ( Arm 3 ) : Participants randomize experimental arm receive standardize program include text/email message access free e-cigarettes , conventional Nicotine Replacement Therapy ( NRT ) , Zyban , Chantix . Each order directly , free charge , web-based interface . No incentive give participant randomized arm . They receive compensation complete study related activity ( sample submission ) . Outcome Incentive arm ( Arm 4 ) : Participants randomize experimental arm receive standardized program access free e-cigarettes , NRT , Zyban , Chantix . In addition , also able earn incentive across six month test negative tobacco use ( see Incentive payout , ) . They also receive compensation complete study related activity ( sample submission ) . Loss frame incentive arm ( Arm 5 ) : Participants randomize experimental arm receive standardized program access free e-cigarettes , NRT , Zyban , Chantix . In addition also able earn incentive across six month pre-funded deposit precommitment account . They notify incentive place account . At time point lose portion initial funding provide biochemical evidence abstinence . They also receive compensation complete study related activity ( sample submission ) .</detailed_description>
