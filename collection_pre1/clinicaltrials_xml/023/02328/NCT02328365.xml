	<detailed_description>Background overview More one third patient colorectal cancer ( CRC ) suffer comorbidity heart lung disease . This comorbidity markedly impair survival surgical treatment owe increase mortality within first week month surgery , increase mortality relate medical complication heart lung complication . Since operation constitutes severe challenge patient 's cardiopulmonary system , study aim elucidate whether systematic perioperative management follow-up colorectal cancer patient cardiopulmonary comorbidity may improve outcome measure complication , hospitalisation time , survival within first year . All patient schedule elective surgical treatment colorectal cancer Vejle Hospital screen study nurse cardiopulmonary comorbidity determine eligibility inclusion . If fulfil inclusion criterion , see preoperatively cardiologist and/or pulmonary physician undergo echocardiography and/or spirometry . Included patient randomize postoperatively either standard follow-up alone ( `` standard '' group ) standard follow-up supplement structure medical management follow-up ( `` intervention '' group ) . Patients intervention group examine 4th 5th postoperative day experience physician Department Internal Medicine . Furthermore , intervention group follow outpatient visit 1 3 month postoperatively . The 1-month visit include cardiology visit echocardiography ECG , pulmonary medicine visit spirometry . The 3-month visit include pulmonary medicine visit spirometry . Mortality , cardiopulmonary complication , hospitalisation time treatment change induce structured follow-up record outcome measure intervention . Hypothesis Patients cardiopulmonary comorbidity standard follow-up extend include structure medical management follow-up surgery colorectal cancer obtain good outcome measure less cardiopulmonary morbidity well survival within first year . Aim To test study design systematic preoperative screening cardiopulmonary comorbidity postoperative randomization eligible patient either standard followup alone standard follow-up supplement structure medical management follow-up operation colorectal cancer . Design A randomized feasibility study . Based old data , require approximately 400 patient arm demonstrate 10 % reduction expect mortality . This study aim test design acquire reliable mortality data arm order establish basis large multicentre study .</detailed_description>
