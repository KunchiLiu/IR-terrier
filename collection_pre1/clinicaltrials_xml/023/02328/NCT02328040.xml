	<brief_summary>There many recent advance insulin treatment type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( Type 1 DM ) , however meal sugar always concern . There drug sitagliptin ( Januvia ) FDA approve treat people type 2 diabetes help correct glucose ( sugar ) meal . This study go test whether drug improve meal sugar people type 1 diabetes . To test , give mixed meal effect insulin level . The hormone affect blood glucose well sugar level measure series blood test . We also look high blood sugar might occur food stay long stomach usual due suppression hormone call glucagon increase blood sugar . If qualify , give sitagliptin ( Januvia ) 50 mg 100 mg dosage . You researcher know dose take single visit . We first enroll 10 subject establish type 1 Diabetes Mellitus least 1 year , age 18-30 year old . The first 10 patient evaluate safety parameter ability keep blood sugar &lt; 70 mg/dl least 70 % time , episode severe hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar ) . After safety criterion establish , recruit subject age 14-19 yr next phase study . A total 17 subject enrol study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Comparing Sitagliptin Placebo Closed Loop</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Sitagliptin extensively study patient type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( Type 2 DM ) . Sitagliptin increase endogenous GLP-1 ( Glucagon like peptide ) inhibit break enzyme DPP-4 ( Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 ) . GLP-1 turn result glucagon suppression.This mechanism effective improve meal blood sugar , type 2 diabetic also type 1 diabetes . In study test use sitagliptin decrease meal blood sugar set close loop.Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) meet initiation study child enrol study . The safety data meeting submit Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . Specific Aim : In closed loop setting , establish safe effective dose Sitagliptin type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) compare placebo effect lower post meal glucose level , Further test effect insulin utilization , glucagon level gastric empty . Hypothesis : Post meal sugar decrease dose dependent manner due glucagon suppression sitagliptin use close loop set compare placebo . Study Design : Following informed consent ( appropriate subject assent ) , subject Type 1 DM undergo 4 study visit : Screening , Part A ( Placebo/Insulin ) Part B ( Sitagliptin 100 mg ) . A randomized double-blinded 2-period cross study trial use subject participate study . All study subject 's ( 14-30 yr old ) study staff ( except one person ) blind study part study Parts A B random order . Montefiore Medical Center ( MMC ) Investigational pharmacy one study staff ( exclude PI ) un-blinded protocol randomization table , dispense , check dose study medication schedule study visit ( do study staff person ) . The participant admit Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) two occasion Parts A B follow screen visit . Parts A B do least 2 week apart . Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria : Subjects Type 1 DM age group 14-30 year without concomitant illness except treated hypothyroidism recruit also HbA1C le 8.5 % . Menstruating woman must negative pregnancy test . Lactating pregnant woman exclude anyone anemia define Hemoglobin le 12 gm/dl . Also , subject history substance abuse ( evaluated medical history CRAAFT questionnaire administer screen visit ) exclude . The subject 's medication affect blood sugar . Screening : After sign consent form , screen evaluation perform 4-6 week prior study enrollment CRC . The evaluation consist medical history , physical examination ( include height , weight , vital sign tanner stag ) , blood sample clinical laboratory test : CBC ( complete blood count ) , LFT 's ( Liver Function Tests ) , amylase , lipase , creatinine HbA1C . The approximate volume blood drawn expect 12 ml . CRAAFT questionnaire administer . Subjects undergo baseline blind open loop evaluation use Medtronic CGM iPro 2 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System insertion device . It three part - glucose sensor insert subcutaneously , transmitter connects sensor electrode attach body receiver display glucose value . Part A : The subject admit Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) around 2 PM day 1 . Vitals take . IV place blood drawn measure Stat CBC , HbA1C , Liver function test , Serum Amylase , Serum Lipase Serum Creatinine . Study continue Hemoglobin great 12 gm/ dl . Urine pregnancy test do female subject prior study . Insulin infusion subcutaneous pump continue long act analog , novolog give per home regimen . Subjects continuous glucose monitoring system overnight till 9 PM day 2 . BLOOD SAMPLING AND MEDICATIONS : At 6.30 PM day 1 subject start closed-loop device automate delivery insulin base glucose sensor measurement . The insulin dose base patient 's usual insulin carbohydrate ratio . Placebo pill give around 8 PM ( 0 min ) dinner serve carbohydrate consistent diet ( 60 gm carbohydrate ) . Subjects close loop device night till 9 PM day 2 . On day 2 breakfast serve 7 AM ( 660 min ) morning consist boost ( high protein drink ) 9.6 oz , consumed period 10-15 min . Lunch dinner serve 12 PM ( 960 min ) 5 PM ( 1260 min ) . At approximately 6.30 PM baseline blood sample draw prior study start glucose , insulin , glucagon , GLP-1 , DPP-4 activity Sitagliptin . Also , blood draw follow time point : 0 , 60 , 120 , 240 , 360 , 480 , 540 , 600 , 660 , 720 , 780 , 840 , 900 , 960 , 1020 , 1080 , 1140 , 1200 , 1260 , 1320 , 1380 , 1440 . The insulin pump basal rate ( novolog ) set continue per home regimen . Blood glucose concentration measure bedside use Analox glucose analyzer . The subject discharge . They pay separately transportation , park child care . A social security number require . It keep confidential . For minor , compensation give parent , intend child . A subject withdrawn participate study he/she meet follow condition : 1 ) develop chronic disease 2 ) develop anemia 3 ) become pregnant 4 ) develops weight loss great 10 pound unspecified reason 5 ) loss contact- unable reach study subject ( within 2 month screen completion first study ) phone mail schedule next appointment . All study subject ( withdrawn study ) receive phone call letter notify withdrawn . Blood sample keep 20 year assays develop hormone analysis . Since difficult perform clinical study pediatrics , feel well bank blood sample perform hormone analysis newer assay become available rather repeat study . Part B : Will identical part A except Sitagliptin 100 mg administer pill dinner 8 PM day 1 . In Part B urine pregnancy test do visit female subject . Prior part , hemoglobin must &gt; 12 g/dl female subject test negative pregnancy . Treatment Hypoglycemia : If blood glucose value subject less 55 mg/dl , IV glucose 5-10gm , blood glucose le 50 mg/dl , 10-15 g administer counter low blood glucose achieve euglycemia ( 90-130 mg/dl ) . 1-2 dos IV glucose correct hypoglycemia . If 3-4 dos require achieve euglycemia , study terminate subject offer meal tray blood sugar rechecked ensure euglycemia . After completion first 2 study subject , data safety monitoring committee assess safety protocol , well drug dose adjustment protocol make . If hypoglycemia occur even reduce dose insulin , reduction insulin dose advise . The total blood draw volume 95 cc ( 1/2 cup ) Part A B . Statistical Analysis : Sample size : Data earlier trial determine mean area curve ( AUC ) child Type 1 DM insulin alone 470 mg*hr/dl . The current trial design detect 25 % difference mean area curve ( AUC ) glucose 1670 min period . Based power 0.8 , alpha 0.05 correlation coefficient r &gt; /= 0.5 ( base previous study ) standard deviation excursion measure AUC glucose approximately 0.8 two study condition , estimate sample size 16 subject . With usual 10 % drop rate noticed study , would need recruit 17 subject . Data Analysis : Two way analysis variance ( ANOVA ) repeat measure use compare two study period , insulin , glucagon glucose concentration time . Mean area curve ( AUC ) time calculate modify paired t-test use post hoc analysis.Differences consider significant 0.05 . Comparative descriptive statistic compute use SPSS ( Statistical Package Social Sciences ) statistical software Graph pad prism .</detailed_description>
