	<brief_summary>Incident extent pulse alteration administration various mode local anesthesia child routine dental treatment . Our aim : ( 1 ) To estimate percent patient receive mandibular block , C-CLAD-IL infiltration injection show increase pulse rate delivery anesthesia ( spite negative aspiration ) result infiltration adrenalin blood vessel . ( 2 ) To estimate extent pulse rate alteration correlation velocity volume local anesthesia inject . ( 3 ) To examine correlation increase pulse rate effectiveness anesthesia . ( 4 ) To examine correlation needle gauge ( 27 &amp; 30 ) increase pulse rate mandibular block injection spite negative aspiration . We recruit child undergo routine dental treatment local anesthesia ( mandibular block , infiltration C-CLAD-IL ) . Patients connect , immediately entire delivery local anesthetic , pulse-oximeter connect computer continuously monitor pulse rate saturation delivery local anesthesia . Each aberrant event may occur alteration pulse rate gag reflex , cough , pain related disruptive behavior document computer real time another person treat dentist . All type local anesthesia delivery perform computerized-controlled local anesthesia delivery system - Single-Tooth-Anesthesia connect computer document continuously amount velocity local anesthetic deliver patient . All injection perform use 29 gauge needle , except child treat general anesthesia , injection perform also 27 gauge needle . In case pulse rate increase 150 % baseline rate , pulse reach 150 beats/minute injection stop immediately . The continuation local anesthetic delivery continue different location return pulse basic rate . A total 100 patient receive local anesthetic contain 1:100,000 adrenalin 50 patient without adrenaline . Three modes local anesthesia evaluate : C-CLAD-IL , infiltration mandibular block= total 300 patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parents child ( healthy systemic disease ) need local anesthesia ( mandibular block , infiltration C-CLAD-IL ) routine dental treatment ask sign inform consent form participate study . The parent receive explanation aim study evaluate alteration pulse rate delivery different mode local anesthetic delivery ( indirect sign penetration local anesthetic solution blood vessel ) . All patient connect , immediately entire delivery local anesthetic , pulse oximeter ( pulse oximeter , Boston , USA Nellcor N550 ) . The probe attach patient 's finger big toe accord patient 's age . The pulse oximeter connect computer document continuously pulse rate saturation delivery local anesthesia . Each aberrant event may occur alteration pulse rate gag reflex , cough , pain related disruptive behavior ( cry , grimace , body movement verbal complains-CHEOPS , attachment 1 ) document computer real time another person treat dentist . This documentation feasible due new program develop especially study . All type local anesthesia delivery perform computerize controlled local anesthesia delivery system - Single-Tooth-Anesthesia ( C-CLAD , STA , Milestone Scientific , Inc. Deerfield , IL , USA ) connect computer document continuously amount velocity local anesthetic deliver patient . This program kindly provide developed Dr. Mark Hochman USA , part collaboration present study . The local anesthesia perform use Lidocaine 2 % Epinephrine 1:100,000 , Mepivacain HCl 3 % without vasoconstrictor necessary . The use local anesthetic without vasoconstrictor serve control elevation pulse rate result penetration adrenalin blood vessel . When inject mandibular block infiltration , aspiration perform immediately inject solution . In case positive aspiration , find mark ; location needle change negative aspiration receive . All injection perform use 29 gauge needle , except child treat general anesthesia , injection perform also 27 gauge needle . In case pulse rate increase 150 % baseline rate , pulse reach 150 beat per minute injection stop immediately . The continuation local anesthetic delivery continue different location return pulse basic rate . When perform mandibular block injection , lingual buccal nerve anesthetize well . The total injected volume mandibular block delivery 1.8 ml . In case full anesthesia achieve ( wait 5 minute ) additional injection perform . In case amount local anesthetic inject exceed amount 4.4 mg/kg body weight . When participate child schedule two consecutive appointment similar treatment , child receive one appointment local anesthesia without adrenalin adrenalin vice versa . Anesthesia effectiveness . The dentist ass effectiveness anesthesia presence absence ( non-contiguous ) pain-disruptive behavior treatment describe Oulis et al . ( 6 ) . Each single sign discomfort ( even mild ) rat positive presence pain . Signs discomfort include visual acoustic change , hand body tension movement , eye movement , verbal complaint , tear . Anesthesia rat adequate child completely relaxed treatment . Each patient computerize file detail fill The name treat dentist Name patient Systemic disease Type management : behavior management , nitrous oxide , sedation , general anesthesia Type local anesthesia Number tooth Type local anesthetic solution : Lidocaine 2 % 1:100,000 Epinephrine , Mepivacaine HCl 3 % without Epinephrine Gauge needle 30 gauge 27 gauge Side injection Number positive aspiration Number negative aspiration Type treatment provide Effective local anesthesia treatment Basic pulse rate injection Maximum pulse injection The reason increase pulse rate : gag reflex , cough , pain , bitter test , nothing All detail complete immediately complete injection . Number patient 100 patient mode anesthesia 50 patient receive local anesthetic contain 1:100,000 Epinephrine 50 patient without Epinephrine Three modes local anesthesia evaluate : C-CLAD-IL , infiltration mandibular block= 300 patient Each patient participate maximum twice mode anesthesia ( receive local anesthetic contain 1:100,000 Epinephrine 50 patient without Epinephrine ) . The type local anesthesia solution select dentist accord patient 's need affect study . Children fully cooperate treatment exclude present study .
