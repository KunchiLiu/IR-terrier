	<brief_title>European Registry Management Helicobacter Pylori Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abstract Introduction : H. pylori selectively infects human stomach mucosa , prevalent chronic infection world . Its prevalence correlate socioeconomic factor higher old individual . H. pylori presence cause chronic gastritis 100 % infected patient major cause relevant diseases atrophic gastritis , peptic ulcer disease gastric cancer ; reason public health standpoint consider high impact pathogen , responsible significant morbidity mortality . Nowadays Consensus Clinical Guidelines regard infection management European level state , data show level implementation recommendation . The high cost infection carry socially health system require continuous systematic assessment diagnostic treatment strategy , well accessibility diagnostic method efficient drug . Aim : To register treatment , diagnosis management strategy H. pylori infect adult patient Digestive Services outpatient clinic throughout Europe . Methods : Non-interventionist prospective multicentre international registry promote European Helicobacter Study Group . A renowned gastroenterologist country select Local Coordinator ( 30 country ) . They turn select ten gastroenterologist per country register routine clinical practice consultation receive 10 year electronic Case Report Form ( e-CRF ) . Variables retrieve include clinical , diagnostic , treatment , eradication confirmation outcome data . The database allow researcher perform specific subanalysis approval Scientific Committee study . INTRODUCTION H. pylorus presence cause chronic gastritis 100 % infected patient major cause relevant diseases atrophic gastritis , peptic ulcer disease gastric cancer . H. pylori eradication prevents peptic ulcer recurrence complication , decrease incidence gastric cancer . H. pylori eradication patient peptic ulcer even functional non-investigated dyspepsia cost-effective strategy . The common clinical manifestation H. pylori infection dyspepsia , major health problem , whose prevalence reach 10 % among adult population attendant burden morbidity health system cost diagnosis treatment . Approximately 20 % 30 % people community year report chronic recurrent dyspeptic symptom , consultation dyspepsia account 40 % referral among gastroenterology outpatient , `` test-and-treat '' strategy cost-effective . Moreover , H. pylorus major cause peptic ulcer disease , cause 90 % duodenal 70 % gastric ulcer . Considerable evidence support nature chronic inflammatory process drive H. pylori critical importance gastric carcinogenesis ( adenocarcinoma mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue -MALT- lymphoma ) . It reason WHO 's International Agency Research Cancer classify H. pylorus group 1 ( definite ) carcinogen . Scientific evidence demonstrate diagnosis eradication H. pylori cost-effective strategy management dyspepsia , peptic ulcer gastric cancer prevention . The treatment regimens diverse change overtime . Monotherapies treatment two drug achieve acceptable eradication rate . The commonly recommended regimen Consensus Conferences standard triple regimen , combine two antibiotic ( clarithromycin amoxicillin metronidazole ) proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) 7 14 day . Another recommend alternative bismuth-containing quadruple therapy ( PPI , tetracycline , metronidazole bismuth salt ) . In last year , result new efficient rescue regimen include levofloxacin publish . Lately , new treatment propose , include non-bismuth quadruple regimen , two main variant : `` sequential '' treatment ( induction phase PPI amoxicillin second phase PPI , clarithromycin metronidazole ) `` concomitant '' treatment ( four drug take altogether ) . The great diversity regimens treatment line , different efficacy , mostly due increase bacterial antibiotic resistance regional difference , require continuous critical analysis clinical practice , evaluate systematically efficacy safety different regimens cost-effectiveness different diagnostic-therapeutic strategy . This help design efficient optimize treatment reduce number re-treatments , diagnostic test appearance associate pathology peptic ulcer , gastrointestinal bleeding , probably , gastric cancer . Therefore , evaluation real clinical practice use non-interventionist registry help improve design organization European Consensus management H. pylorus infection , best way establish healthcare efficiency . AIMS Primary aim To obtain database register systematically year large representative sample routine clinical practice European gastroenterologist order produce descriptive study management H. pylorus infection . Secondary aim 1 . To evaluate H. pylori infection consensus clinical guideline implementation different country . 2 . To perform study focus epidemiology , efficacy safety commonly use treatment eradicate H. pylorus . 3 . To evaluate accessibility healthcare technology drug use management H. pylorus infection . 4 . To allow development partial specific analysis participate researcher approval Registry 's Scientific Committee . METHODS International multicenter prospective non-interventionist registry promote European Helicobacter Study Group . Scientific Committee - Javier P. Gisbert ( President ) - Francis Megraud - Colm O'Morain - Adrian G. McNicholl Local Coordinators A list European Countries select . Included country least ten clinical research publication PubMed regard H. pylori infection . In country Local Coordinator select base clinical research activity ( Table I ) . The Local Coordinators constitute monitor draft committee registry . The Local Coordinators charge select 10 recruit investigator country charge follow quality recruiting ; link promoter recruit investigator . Recruiter Investigators The Recruiting Investigators must gastroenterologists attend adult population gastroenterology outpatient clinic assist H. pylorus infect patient . Before acceptance outpatient clinic must attend , clinical routine basis , patient H. pylori diagnosis treatment indicate . Eradication confirmation test perform routinely . They register study variable routine clinical practice e-CRF . Study Variables Anonymised Patient Identifiers - Country/Centre/Investigator - Autonumeric Patient identifier number - Gender - Date Birth - Ethnic Background History Comorbidity - Drug allergy - Relevant comorbidities - Current concomitant medication Data Infection - Indication diagnosis treatment - Upper Gastrointestinal tract symptom - Diagnostic Test current treatment - Number type previous eradication attempt Prescribed Treatment - Drugs - Dosage intake per day - Length treatment Compliance - Adherence treatment ( yes/no &gt; 90 % ) Adverse Events - Type event , intensity , duration relation treatment - Treatment withdrawal due adverse event . Efficacy - Eradication ( yes/no ) , test use , date</detailed_description>
