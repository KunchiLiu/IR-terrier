	<detailed_description>Identifying image biomarkers metastatic brain tumor treatment response could allow early modification treatment determination tumor progression vs. treatment related effect ( pseudo-progression , radiation necrosis ) . Earlier treatment response assessment could reduce cost , improve clinical trial efficiency allow well assessment prognosis . The development PET/MRI offer possibility combine functional imaging PET exquisite soft tissue contrast physiologic image capability MRI . Combining FLT-PET image MRI may allow good evaluation new unclear lesion brain metastatic disease . The goal study explore FLT-PET imaging combine dynamic MR image technique identification tumor response marker metastatic brain tumor .</detailed_description>
