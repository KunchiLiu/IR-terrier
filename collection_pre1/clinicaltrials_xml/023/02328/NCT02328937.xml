	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1 . The participant must leat 18 year old old great 65 year old . Children young than18 likely able come back forth clinic typical work week outline ( due school schedule ) thus able adhere protocol . 2 . The participant must current soft contact lens wearer routinely wear lens least 68 hour per day least 4 day per week least past 3 month . 3 . Refraction suitable spherical soft contact lens power 1.00 6.00 D participant must correctable 20/30 good distance eye dispense contact lenses . 4 . The participant must free active anterior segment disorder would preclude safe contact lens wear . Active anterior segment disorder evidence central microbial keratitis allow . However , evidence past CLPU allow long 3 scar detect bilaterally . Evidence 3 CLPUlike scar place excessive risk participant subsequent CIE. 5 . The participant must correctable 20/25 good eye spectacle . Amblyopia exclude . 6 . Flat steep corneal curvature keratometry reading must 39.00 48.50 D , respectively . Corneal curvature outside range may indicative disease state , participant expect comfortably wear study lens . 7 . The participant must agree purchase pair spectacle wear lens remove , washout period , case ocular discomfort emergency . 1 . The participant worn rigid gas permeable contact lenses within last 30 day PMMA lenses within past 12 month . These lens transiently alter corneal shape influence fit soft contact lenses alter endothelial cell morphology . 2 . The participant immunocompromising disease systemic disease investigator 's opinion affect ocular health increase risk daily contact lens wear . 3 . The participant take medication investigator 's opinion affect ocular physiology study participation . 4 . The participant ocular disease condition aphakia , clinically significant corneal dystrophy , corneal edema , external ocular infection , iritis , anterior segment surgery . 5 . The participant take ocular medication . If participant previous take ocular medication , medication must discontinue least 2 week prior enrollment . 6 . The participant must less equal grade 2 slit lamp observation : upper tarsal papilla , corneal staining , corneal neovascularization , conjunctival injection , lid erythema scale . 7 . The participant currently pregnant lactating . Participant become pregnant study discontinue . 8 . An employee member UHCMC Eye Institute family member study personnel .</criteria>
