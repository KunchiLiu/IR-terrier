	<brief_summary>A custom design Virtual Gait Retraining System ( VGRS ) adapt balance mobility rehabilitation individual transtibial amputation . The system compose treadmill simulate different environmental situation walk stair hill go around curve . The treadmill synchronize immersive display avatar user . The combination variable terrain visual feedback extremely promising mean amputee patient achieve improve functional mobility gait training . The propose work relevant public health first step develop novel rehabilitation system use visual feedback gait training amputees others pathological gait disorder . The research pertinent mission Department Veterans Affairs commit improve quality life Veterans disability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lower extremity amputation cause impairment gait balance due loss proprioception motor control . The asymmetry present amputee gait think one major contributor secondary musculoskeletal problem osteoarthritis . After low extremity amputation , physical rehabilitation necessary achieve functional ambulation ; however , evidence-based standard care exist individual undergo transtibial ( TT ) amputation . The objective application determine effectiveness gait train immersive virtual environment people transtibial amputation . The investigator ' custom design Virtual Gait Retraining System ( VGRS ) virtual reality ( VR ) system provide visual motor challenge treadmill walk . The VGRS immerse user virtual world , provide additional feedback avatar present user challenge task incline stair climb complement movement treadmill . The central hypothesis people amputation achieve great improvement balance , mobility gait function use investigator ' custom design VGRS compare current conventional treadmill gait training . This objective accomplished address follow specific aim : - 1 ) Compare efficacy VGRS conventional treadmill training . - 2 ) Evaluate rate improvement course training program ( VGRS conventional treadmill ) . The investigator conduct randomize clinical trial twenty TT amputee subject compare 6 week train VGRS 6 week train use conventional treadmill protocol . The investigator use gait analysis , postural sway standard balance mobility instrument include 6-Minute Walk Test , Four Square Step Test , Berg Balance Scale Dynamic Gait Index ass improvement gait mobility . The investigator evaluate subject pre- post training interim point 3 week train session . The investigator anticipate VGRS deliver effective training create realistic challenging environment accurate visual perception motor task simultaneously perform user . The investigator also gain understanding rate improvement TT amputee treadmill train . The research design demonstrate need immersive virtual reality include rich visual display affords opportunity train variety terrain condition mobility task .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects must unilateral transtibial amputee ( TTA ) age 18 65 consistently use prosthesis least one year . Subjects must community ambulators K3 level , dictate ability potential walk variable cadence , traverse environmental barrier may vocational , therapeutic , exercise activity demand prosthetic utilization beyond simple locomotion . History surgical procedure intact limb . Subjects exclude study present cardiovascular , neurological , balance disorder affect gait . Rheumatoid arthritis , knee joint replacement , use ambulatory aid also exclude participation . Subjects considerable pain knee joint , measure visual analog scale also exclude due confound effect pain gait pattern . A medical history screening use identify subject preexist condition would compromise gait .</criteria>
