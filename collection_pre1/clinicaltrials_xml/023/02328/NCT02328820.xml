	<brief_summary>This study evaluate prognostic value therapeutic potential combine pressure flow measurement evaluate coronary artery stenosis . Lesions intact coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) despite reduce fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) receive optimal medical therapy . Only lesion simultaneous reduction CFR FFR treat percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pressure flow represent two physiologic variable measure directly inside coronary artery . Already pressure measurement proven clinical value form fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) . However , myocardial function remain intact sufficient flow , even low perfusion pressure . Therefore , combined pressure flow measurement provide complete description physiologic stenosis severity guide medical treatment versus revascularization . Based exist work relate common flow measurement , coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) , FFR link variable subsequent prognosis , hypothesize lesion intact CFR &gt; =2.0 reasonably treat medical therapy despite reduced FFR &lt; =0.8 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year . Eligible PCI base local practice standard current procedure ( PCI stag ) . At least one epicardial stenosis ≥50 % diameter ( visual quantitative assessment ) meeting follow criterion determine operator base either prior current diagnostic angiogram : &lt; 100 % diameter ( chronic , total occlusion ) ; native coronary artery ( include side branch exclude bypass graft ) ; ≥2.5mm reference diameter ( near level stenosis ) ; supply sufficiently viable myocardium ( exclude region know , prior , transmural myocardial infarction ) . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . Anatomic exclusion : Prior CABG . Preferred treatment strategy revascularization would CABG base local practice standard . Left main coronary artery disease require revascularization . Extremely tortuous calcify coronary artery preclude intracoronary physiologic measurement . Operators may also exclude subtotal similar highgrade lesion , judgment may threaten ComboWire placement . Known severe LV hypertrophy ( septal wall thickness echocardiography &gt; 13 mm ) . Clinical exclusion : Inability receive intravenous adenosine ( example , severe reactive airway disease , mark hypotension , highgrade AV block without pacemaker ) . Recent ( within 3 week prior cardiac catheterization ) STsegment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) arterial distribution ( specifically target lesion ) . Culprit lesion ( base clinical judgment operator ) either STEMI nonSTEMI include . Severe cardiomyopathy ( LV ejection fraction &lt; 30 % ) . Planned need cardiac surgery ( example , valve surgery , treatment aortic aneurysm , septal myomectomy ) . General exclusion : A life expectancy le 2 year . Inability sign inform consent , due mental condition render subject unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence trial due mental retardation language barrier . Potential noncompliance towards requirement followup visit . Participation plan participation another cardiovascular clinical trial complete 24 month followup .</criteria>
