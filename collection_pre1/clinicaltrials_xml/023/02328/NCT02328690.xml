	<detailed_description>The purpose prospective , double-blind , repeated measure study assess efficacy Binaural Beat Technology ( BBT- sound technology use special tone [ embed music ] stereo headphone affect brainwaves order put relaxed state ) anxiety anxiety relate cardiovascular measure well ass feasibility implement BBT intervention military population high risk post-deployment window . A sample 74 Warriors deploy randomly place two group ( music BBT music without BBT ) . Each group expose respective intervention 30 minute bedtime , 3 time week , 4 week . Quantitative qualitative measure collect follows… 1 . Cardiovascular reactivity , c-reactive protein , state anxiety measure collect baseline 4 week intervention . 2 . Morning blood pressure ( BP ) surge even BP decline measure collect baseline week 0 , 2 4 . 3 . Input participant collect via daily log completion 4 week intervention . Aim 1 - To assess feasibility implement binaural beat technology intervention military population high risk post deployment window . Feasibility measure assessing : 1. retention 2. number refusal recruitment 3. number drop out 4. reason drop out 5. reason stay 6. number day technology use 7. selection music 8. ease use comfort equipment 9. adherence protocol 10. evaluation recruitment strategy Aim 2 - To assess impact binaural beat technology anxiety relevant CV health measure . These measure include : 1 . Comparison pre post intervention state anxiety score 2 . Observing trend morning blood pressure surge time 3 . Observing trend even blood pressure decline time 4 . Comparison pre post intervention heart rate variability measure 5 . Comparison pre post intervention c-reactive protein measure</detailed_description>
