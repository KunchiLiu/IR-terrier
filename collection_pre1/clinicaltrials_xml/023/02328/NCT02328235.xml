	<brief_summary>Skeletal muscle burn significant amount fat sugar circulates blood stream . Ideally , sugar elevate blood stream , muscle either use make new energy store later use . Likewise , fatty acid . Skeletal muscle obese diabetic human show inadequately use either sugar fatty acid increase blood stream , term metabolic inflexibility . The cause metabolic inflexibility know , believe eat fat body need energy may contribute factor . Metabolic inflexibility skeletal muscle bad muscle use sugar fat , store elsewhere body potentially lead obesity resistance insulin . The investigator perform research study nonobese , healthy human feed high fat diet 5 day . Interesting , 5 day high fat diet sufficient cause skeletal muscle become metabolically inflexible like observed obese diabetic human . The investigator propose addition study fee healthy human high fat diet 5 day effort well understand cause metabolic flexibility . The investigator speculate high fat diet cause intestine release substance call endotoxin cause muscle become metabolically inflexible . The investigator test notion propose study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To discern potential mechanism ( ) high saturate fat feed disrupts normal skeletal muscle metabolism . Our work hypothesis high saturate fat feeding increase gut permeability blood endotoxin , elicit pro-inflammatory signal skeletal muscle alters normal adaptive response meal . Preliminary evidence use model acute ( 5 day ) , high saturate fat feeding , isocaloric habitual intake , healthy , non-obese human present herein support hypothesis . Background : The inability skeletal muscle adapt fuel oxidation fuel availability term metabolic inflexibility , well characterized feature disease state obesity , metabolic syndrome , type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . The mechanism ( ) responsible skeletal muscle metabolic inflexibility know . Recently , grow interest role gut permeability blood endotoxin pathology metabolic derangement associate obesity T2D . Rodent study reveal direct link gut microbiome metabolic disease , well association elevate blood endotoxin metabolic dysregulation , whole body tissue level . High fat feeding rodent know elicit elevated level blood endotoxin , phenomenon term metabolic endotoxemia . In human , obesity T2D associate increase blood endotoxin single meal show elevate blood endotoxin , date , evidence human high fat feeding result metabolic endotoxemia . Moreover , establish link gut permeability , metabolic endotoxemia , skeletal muscle metabolic function human . Approach . We propose utilize model acute high fat feed healthy human study interplay gut function , blood endotoxin , skeletal muscle pro-inflammatory signal metabolic adaptability . We employ two-week lead-in period , research participant feed prepared meal isocaloric habitual diet , follow five day high saturate fat feeding . The high saturate fat feeding period consist prepared meal isocaloric habitual diet macronutrient composition 50 % fat ( 45 % saturated fat ) , 35 % carbohydrate , 15 % protein . Studying healthy , nonobese human context innovative approach two level : 1 ) confounding influence associate metabolic disease ( obesity , diabetes , metabolic syndrome ) eliminate , e.g. , insulin resistance , hyperlipidemia , impaired gut function , pre-existing metabolic dysfunction inflammatory tone ; 2 ) isocaloric feed design negates confound influence positive energy balance allow u specifically examine effect acutely increase dietary saturate fat .</detailed_description>
