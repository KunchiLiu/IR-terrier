	<brief_summary>The overall purpose study determine replace standard soybean oil base fat emulsion Omegaven® , fish oil base fat emulsion , reverse prevent progression parenteral nutrition associate liver disease . It compassionate use protocol patient already significant liver disease related parenteral nutrition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compassionate Use Omegaven® Treatment Intestinal Failure Associated Liver Disease Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parenteral Nutrition ( PN ) potentially life-saving intervention child short bowel syndrome intestinal failure . Many common neonatal surgical disease include Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) , intestinal atresia , gastroschisis cause intestinal failure . The recovery illnesses often involve prolonged period parenteral nutrition . Intestinal Failure Associated Liver Disease ( IFALD ) prevalent complication long term parenteral nutrition child , affect 2/3 child short bowel syndrome . Parenteral lipid important source calorie child , provide essential fatty acid . Development IFALD multifactorial process . Phytosterols contain soybean base lipid emulsion show predispose animal IFALD . Previous study child show dose soybean base parenteral lipid emulsion dos great 1g/kg/day may contribute development IFALD . It currently practice limit lipid dose child risk development IFALD 1g/kg/day . Despite , patient still develop biochemical evidence cholestasis IFALD . Previous study human show child IFALD administer intravenous fish oil lipid emulsion Omegaven® reduce serum direct bilirubin level . This may due reduction amount arachidonic acide derive inflammatory mediator . The investigator hypothesize administer Omegaven® place conventional soybean fat emulsion may reverse prevent progression PN associate cholestasis thus allow patient maintain adequate PN he/she able ingest adequate nutrition enterally .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Parenteral nutrition ( PN ) dependent ( unable meet nutritional need solely enteral nutrition ) expect require PN least another 30 day . Parenteral nutrition associate liver disease ( PNALD ) define direct bilirubin ≥ 2mg/dL histology and/or currently Omegaven another protocol . Other cause liver disease exclude . A liver biopsy necessary treatment . Exhaustion standard therapy prevent progression liver disease include surgical treatment , cyclic PN , avoid overfeeding , reduction/removal copper manganese form PN , advancement enteral feeding , use ursodiol . Pregnancy Other cause liver disease Enrollment clinical trial involve investigational agent ( unless approve designated physician multidisciplinary team ) The parent/guardian subject unwilling provide consent assent</criteria>
