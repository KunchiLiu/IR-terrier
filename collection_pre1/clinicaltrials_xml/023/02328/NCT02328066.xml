	<brief_title>Diagnostic Accuracy NICE Classification Predict Deep Submucosal Invasion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In first phase study , learn program NICE classification base example perform . Forty image evaluate learn program . In second phase study , consecutive patient underwent colonoscopy include lesion great 1 cm find endoscopy perform high definition colonoscope Narrow Band Imaging ( NBI ) . Patients , lesion endoscopy equipment characteristic record . Subsequently , histological diagnosis lesion also record . Evaluated test ( NICE classification ) blind pathologist perform gold standard test ( histology ) . In case adenocarcinoma , histological predictor lymph node metastasis , predefined assessment criterion , also record . Finally , histological preparation adenocarcinomas sent reference center two experienced pathologist examine .</detailed_description>
