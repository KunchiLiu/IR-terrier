	<detailed_description>The propose study randomize , double-blinded clinical trial evaluate efficacy course laser therapy peripheral neuropathic pain person diabetes . Participants assess baseline , post-intervention , 3-months followup , study consist two treatment arm , include : ( ) twice-per-week laser treatment 4 week once-per-week laser treatment 8 week ( b ) treatment schedule sham ( placebo ) 12 week . Additionally , study examine inflammatory marker , functional status , quality life . Specific Aim 1 . Change baseline self-reported pain sample adult diabetes last visit 3 month . Hypothesis 1 : The laser therapy produce significant improvement post-intervention three-month followup measure self-reported pain among adult diabetes . Specific Aim 2 : Decrease biochemical marker inflammation investigate level cytokine . Hypothesis 2 : The laser therapy produce significant improvement post-intervention three-month followup level inflammatory markers.Specific Aim 3 : Improve quality life . Hypothesis 3 : The laser therapy produce significant improvement post-intervention three-month followup quality life.No substantial psychological , medical , social risk exist participant , minor discomfort associate venipuncture . Although measure protect confidentiality put place , possibility exist electronic data could jeopardize . In remote case event occur , immediately report IRB.The proper use LiteCure LightForce FX Therapy Laser class IV laser therapy device harmless present different risk similar laser therapy device currently market . At time submission , serious adverse event report company regulatory authority consumer . All study personnel complete detailed training use device follow direction manufacturer operate device ; instruction use device follow subject . As reported LiteCure Medical LiteCure LightForce FX therapy laser device clear FDA , test accord IEC electrical safety standard medical device , manufacture ISO13485 compliant facility . These certification ensure LiteCure Medical device manufacture state art facility , strict quality control , environmental protection standard . Participants incur additional appreciable psychological social risk participate study . The process interview assessment may cause discomfort . Discomfort fatigue may also experience complete assessment battery . The information obtain study help determine efficacy use class IV laser therapy device neuropathic pain , inflammation , quality life person diabetic distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy . By participate study , subject may feel less pain , low inflammation , experience improve quality life . The minimal risk participate study reasonable potential benefit gain pain status , inflammatory status , quality life .</detailed_description>
