	<brief_summary>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection frequent opportunistic viral infection transplantation . It associate increased incidence acute rejection lower graft patient survival . The goal study demonstrate immunosuppressive regimen associate everolimus reduce dose cyclosporine A prevent acute rejection episodes efficiently standard regimen also efficiently reduce incidence CMV infection 6 month post-transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proportion CMV Seropositive Kidney Transplant Recipients Who Will Develop CMV Infection When Treated With Immunosuppressive Regimen Including Everolimus Reduced Dose Cyclosporineversus Immunosuppressive Regimen With Mycophenolic Acid Standard Dose Cyclosporine A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection frequent opportunistic viral infection kidney transplantation . Therefore patient receive universal prophylaxis . On contrary CMV naïve patient , seropositive recipient ( R+ ) already mount specific immunologic response direct virus , completely abrogate immunosuppressive drug . Although CMV infection management guideline offer little guidance immunosuppressive therapy prevent CMV infection disease , recent data plead reappraise place mTOR inhibitor situation . The potential anti-CMV action molecule could add potential antitumor effect equivalent immunosuppressive efficacy kidney transplant recipient low immunological risk . By way , could represent alternative systematic universal prophylaxis R+ kidney transplant recipient . However , proof anti-CMV action must confirm vivo study , could close monitor CMV infection . We therefore design prospective multicentric randomize control trial compare immunosuppressive regimen base everolimus reduce dose cyclosporine A regimen base mycophenolic acid standard dose cyclosporine A , order demonstrate superiority first one prevention CMV infection . Subjects randomize one two treatment arm follow period 12 month . Whole blood CMV real time PCR perform every week first three month , every two week Month 3 Month 6 , Months 8 , 10 12 . Incidence CMV infection compare two arm 6 12 month post-transplantation .</detailed_description>
