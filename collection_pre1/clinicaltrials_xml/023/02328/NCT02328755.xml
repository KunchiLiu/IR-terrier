	<brief_title>Peginterferon Alfa-2a Enhance Anti-leukemic Responses After Allogeneic Transplantation Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol open label , single arm , non-randomized , phase I / II clinical trial investigating use pegylated interferon alpha-2a ( peg-IFN-α , Pegasys® , Genentech ) prevention relapse acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) remission time allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HCT ) . The inability attain remission status follow induction therapy AML remain significant problem associate poor outcome . While HCT remain curative option , activity set relapse refractory AML significantly diminish due high relapse . The anti-leukemic property HCT primarily attribute combined effect 1 ) pre - transplant chemotherapy ( termed conditioning ) 2 ) immunologic effect donor cell ( term graft-versus-leukemia GVL ) . While increase intensity conditioning reduces relapse , strategy historically associate great toxicity . Alternatively , improve GVL without add toxicity ( particularly graft-versus-host disease ) represent alternative strategy limit relapse improve outcome , aim protocol . IFN-α , FDA approve viral hepatitis , demonstrate anti-tumor activity several hematologic malignancy include myeloproliferative disease AML . IFN-α also show feasibility treatment post HCT relapse elicit durable clinical response , without significant toxicity . Recent insight pre-clinical study HCT identify central role IFN-α enhance antigen presentation , thereby promote leukemia specific T cell response ( GVL ) without GVHD . In protocol , investigator propose administer peg-IFN-α prevent relapse increase GVL responses patient relapse refractory AML remission time HCT .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must AML remission high risk HCT ( Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation ) relapse . For newly diagnose AML , patient must achieve two consecutive induction attempt without achieve complete remission For patient initially complete remission whose AML relapse &gt; 6 month precede remission , one reinduction must attempt eligible For AML patient early relapse , precede remission shorter 6 month duration , reinduction regimen necessary eligible Patients antecedent MDS ( Myelodysplastic Syndrome ) progress AML may therapies render phase count towards requirement . Patients poor cytogenetic molecular risk associate high risk relapse HCT may proceed without provision prior treatment . However , must receive least one induction attempt .
