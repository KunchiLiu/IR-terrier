	<brief_title>Feasibility Validity Remote Lung Function Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study plan test new non invasive way measure lung function compare current method blowing spirometer . Spirometry essential investigation diagnosis assessment severity people Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) respiratory condition , use every respiratory unit across primary care . It require subject blow tube measure volume flow expire air . It involve specialist equipment train perform interpret . Not patient capable perform spirometry , particular child , frail , cognitively impaired experience flare exacerbation symptom . Remote lung function assessment technology potential enable assessment lung function group patient . In future also hop could use improve respiratory disease monitoring outside healthcare environment patient home . This new method use late infra-red depth detection camera measure chest wall movement . ( N.B capture identifiable image ) . We would like record participant chest wall movement blow spirometer .</detailed_description>
