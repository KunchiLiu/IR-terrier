	<brief_summary>Ankylosing spondylitits ( AS ) chronic , systemic rheumatic disease primarily affect spine sacroiliac joint , belongs group condition know spondyloarthopathies cause eventual fusion spine . Twin study AS estimate heritability 90 % . HLA-B27 regard earlist important gene associate AS heritability , 90 % AS patient carry HLA-B27 gene . HLA-B27 highly polymorphic , 89 subtypes B27 gene find . Subtypes HLA-B27 vary different region , relationship HLA-B27 subtypes disease development among different race . Anti-TNF- agent regard one milestone recent year development treatment ankylose spondylitis , patient show significant improvement anti-TNF- therapy . Yet part patient still show insufficient response . Our previous study suggest AS patient carry different genotype SNP TNF gene different response anti-TNF- therapy . But study carry identified gene polymorphism associate treatment response . In study design prospective , open-label trial investigate genetic difference beween AS patient different response anti-TNF- therapy . We plan enroll 50-100 early AS patient fulfill 2009 ASAS axial spondyloarthritis classification criterion axial symptom 2 year . The patient must high disease activity define BASDAI 4 , HLA-B27 test must positive . The patient able receive 24 week etanercept treatment . And patient previous anti-TNF- therapy contraindication anti-TNF- therapy must exclude . Other medicine stable least 4 week etanercept treatment begin . For clinic assessment , patient fill AS questionaires receive physical examination visit . ASAS20 think primary endpoint . For genetic polymorphysm detection , select 10-20 SNP MHC region associate AS 5-10 HLA-B27 subtypes work definite association AS . At first visit 4ml anticoagulated blood collect DNA extract . Target SNPs detect PCR direct sequencing . HLA-B27 subtypes identify use PCRSSP method . And relationship SNPs/HLA-B27 subtypes different response anti TNF- therapy access use chi-square statistic process SPSS software . In study plan investigate relationship genetic background clinical response anti-TNF- therapy AS patient , seldom report . Our group study disease-associated gene AS year , get plenty data experience genetic study AS .</brief_summary>
