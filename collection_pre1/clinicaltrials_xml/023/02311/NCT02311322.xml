	<brief_summary>Background : - Some growth disorder cause change gene . Genes instruction body use function . Changes gene often cause work correctly . Researchers want use new technology call exome sequencing , look many gene . This do look DNA blood saliva lab . This method may help find cause disorder researcher able find use past method . Objectives : - To good understand genetic cause growth disorder . Eligibility : - Children adult growth disorder family member . Design : - Participants give small sample blood and/or saliva . - Researchers purify DNA sample . They perform exome sequencing test look change gene . Some participant may receive limited genetic test . Researchers let know exome sequence perform . - Participants may medical history , physical exam , lab test . They may x-ray ultrasound test study disorder family . - Some participant may recommend specific genetic test commercial lab . They may pay test . - Participants tell test result relate growth disorder . This may happen year test . They may give another blood and/or saliva sample . - Some participant may get result health condition . This happen information would help person family protect health . They may give another blood and/or saliva sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Children often present pediatrician pediatric endocrinologist abnormal body growth , include childhood growth failure , less commonly , overgrowth . Sometimes cause evident , example , growth hormone deficiency growth failure growth hormone excess overgrowth . In child , etiology remain unknown despite extensive evaluation , result unhelpful diagnosis severe idiopathic short stature tall stature . These condition quite heterogeneous , include child isolated growth disorder others also abnormalities developmental delay constellation congenital anomaly ( syndromic growth disorder ) . Some case severe growth disorder polygenic inheritance others appear inherit monogenic trait recessive , dominant X-linked . Because recent advance DNA sequence technology , feasible sequence exome ( portion genome encodes gene exon ) family monogenic disorder thereby determine underlie molecular etiology . We therefore propose study identify novel genetic cause idiopathic growth disorder use whole-exome sequencing . The primary goal study identify novel cause childhood growth disorder order improve clinical diagnosis , provide precise characterization associate medical problem , prognosis , response treatment base etiology , gain new insight regulation human growth , may eventually lead new therapeutic approach . Subjects include child adult clearly recognizable phenotype include either short stature tall stature pedigree strongly suggest monogenic inheritance . Both syndromic non-syndromic growth disorder proportionate disproportionate growth disorder include . Affected unaffected family member ( informative meiotic inheritance relationship proband index case ) also study importance genetic approach . The phenotype characterize medical history , physical exam , body measurement , laboratory evaluation . Blood saliva sample collect whole-exome sequence single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) array analysis . Candidate sequence variant typically verify Sanger sequence .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : If subject meet one criterion , he/she potentially eligible participate : Short stature ( height less 2 SDS ) , either currently previously Tall stature ( height great + 2 SDS ) Bone age delay ( great 3 year ) Bone age advancement ( great 2.5 year great 1.5 year short stature ) Predicted adult height &lt; 2SD Growth disorder treat promptly , thus maintain child height within normal range , e.g . subject congenital growth hormone deficiency multiple pituitary hormone deficiency unknown genetic etiology receive growth hormone treatment begin early life Family member subject meet criterion The growth disorder : Of postnatal onset ( born appropriate gestational age ) prenatal onset ( small gestational age/large gestational age ) Nonsyndromic syndromic ( accompanied malformations/abnormalities ) Proportionate disproportionate The pedigree suggest monogenic inheritance : Autosomal recessive Autosomal dominant De novo mutation Xlinked dominant/recessive EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A nongenetic disorder condition , either congenital acquire , explain growth abnormality , example , pituitary injury , chronic thyroiditis , whole body irradiation , celiac disease . A welldocumented diagnosis genetic disorder condition explain growth abnormality molecular genetic etiology already identify , example , SHOX deficiency , hypochondroplasia , Noonan syndrome .</criteria>
