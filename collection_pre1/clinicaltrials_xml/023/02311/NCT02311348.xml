	<detailed_description>Millions Americans diagnose form Hepatitis liver disease require treatment . Liver biopsies frequently perform mainly stage disease , aid diagnosis guide treatment . As part assessment Hepatitis patient , liver biopsy frequently part regimen . Liver biopsy procedure perform use one two method : percutaneous liver biopsy ( PLB ) transjugular liver biopsy ( TLB ) . Alknawy &amp; Shiffman ( 2007 ) discus approach percutaneous liver biopsy include percussion-palpation approach , image guide , ultrasound assist , ultrasound guide type biopsy needle use . The method liver biopsy select randomly assign determined hepatologist care patient . Pain complication follow liver biopsy require adequate pain management . Despite extensive review previous study , none find discuss pain experience patient undergone PLB versus TLB . This study propose compare amount pain experience patient undergone PLB versus TLB . Thirty-two male female patient age 18 year old meet study criterion invite participate . The participant place either PLB TLB group group consist 16 male 16 female participant . Prior biopsy within first 6 hour post procedure , 2 , 4 6-hour time point , patient ask rate pain Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) Numeric Pain Scale ( NPS ) . Additionally , dolorimeter use pre liver biopsy along VAS NPS standardize pain measurement .</detailed_description>
