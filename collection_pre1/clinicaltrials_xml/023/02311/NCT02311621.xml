	<brief_summary>Patients recurrent refractory neuroblastoma resistance conventional chemotherapy . For reason , investigator attempt use T cell obtain directly patient , genetically modify express chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) . The CAR enable T cell recognize kill neuroblastoma cell recognition CD171 , protein express surface neuroblastoma cell patient neuroblastoma . This phase 1 study design determine maximum tolerate dose CAR+ T cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Engineered Neuroblastoma Cellular Immunotherapy ( ENCIT ) -01</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon meet eligibility requirement enrol study , subject undergo apheresis obtain T cell generation CD171 CAR+ T cell . The T cell isolated apheresis product , CD4 CD8 T cell select grown separately , transduce lentivirus express CD171 CAR well truncate EGFR signal capacity ( noted EGFRt ) expand culture 4-6 week period . During process cell generation , subject continue care primary oncologist may undergo additional treatment direct neuroblastoma time . After CAR+ T cell generate , subject undergoes disease assessment determination necessary lymphodepletion therapy . A variety lymphodepletion strategy acceptable determined case case basis . At least 48 hour completion lymphodepletion , subject receive infusion CAR+ T cell approximate 1:1 ratio CD4 CD8 CAR+ T cell . Following treatment CAR+ T cell , subject follow intensely 6 week serial blood test re-evaluation disease status MIBG scintigraphy , tumor image MRI/CT bone marrow aspirate . After 4-6 week , subject clinical care resume primary oncologist , possible would receive additional chemotherapy investigational agent . Some subject receive cetuximab ablation genetically modify T cell . Criteria receive cetuximab include acute toxicity life threatening , well study indicate lymphoproliferative disorder arise infuse genetically modify T cell . Upon completion study , subject follow bi-annually 5 year , annually 10 additional year either medical history , physical exam blood test phone call/questionnaire . This follow help determine subject develops long-term health problem relate CAR+ T cell include new cancer .</detailed_description>
