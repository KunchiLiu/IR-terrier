	<brief_title>Tamoxifen Citrate Z-Endoxifen Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic , Estrogen Receptor-Positive , HER2-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess whether progression-free survival z-endoxifen hydrochloride ( HCl ) relative tamoxifen ( tamoxifen citrate ) prolong postmenopausal woman local advance metastatic estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive/Her2 negative breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety profile agent patient population . II . To assess whether tumor response rate ( determine use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion ) among randomize z-endoxifen HCl differs among randomized tamoxifen . III . To estimate median progression-free survival time receive z-endoxifen HCl disease progression tamoxifen . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine whether ER alpha alteration ( define either ER activate mutation ER amplification ) associate longer progression-free survival ( PFS ) high response rate z-endoxifen HCl arm compare tamoxifen arm . II . To determine change lipid profile compare tamoxifen z-endoxifen HCl . III . For treatment , evaluate change marker bone formation absorption 12 week ( 4 cycle ) treatment . IV . For patient treatment arm , determine whether progression-free survival differs respect sensitive endocrine therapy ( SET ) index . V. To examine whether deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) alteration measure Foundation medicine cod exon 287 cancer-related gene well 78 polymorphism 34 absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion ( ADME ) -related gene associate longer PFS high response rate z-endoxifen HCl arm compare tamoxifen arm . VI . To assess whether molecular characteristic identify tumor biopsy detectable circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) and/or cell-free DNA ( cfDNA ) . VII . For treatment arm : examine change ER expression CTCs , change estrogen receptor ( ESR ) mutation amplification CTCs CfDNA explore impact change PFS response rate . VIII . To characterize pharmacokinetics , pharmacogenetics metabolism z-endoxifen HCl tamoxifen . IX . To determine impact concentration tamoxifen metabolite PFS tamoxifen arm . X . To determine impact concentration z-endoxifen HCl metabolites PFS endoxifen arm . XI . To determine impact genetic variation enzymes responsible tamoxifen z-endoxifen HCl metabolism . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive z-endoxifen hydrochloride orally ( PO ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive tamoxifen citrate PO daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression bone metastasis may cross Arm I receive z-endoxifen hydrochloride start later 28 day documentation disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow yearly 5 year .</detailed_description>
