	<brief_summary>Phantom limb pain ( PLP ) painful sensation locate miss limb classify neuropathic pain . In United States , estimate 1.7 million patient undergone limb amputation , 60 % 80 % patient develop PLP ( 1-2 ) usually resistant wide variety treatment ( 1-4 ) . Three factor may contribute development persistent , post-amputation PLP induce central sensitization different time relative surgery : pre-amputation pain , noxious intraoperative stimulus , acute postoperative pain ( 5-7 ) . Investigators hypothesis pre-amputation period could important eliminate Phantom Limb Pain ( PLP ) patient cortical reorganization yet establish . The reduction pre-operative pain prevention formation pain memory may eliminate development PLP use dual network treatment strategy . This Phase III , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study design evaluate efficacy pre-operative pregabalin ( lyrica ) ketamine eliminate phantom limb pain patient undergo low limb amputation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-operative Pregabalin Ketamine Prevent Phantom Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo unilateral low extremity amputation ( n=30 ) randomize double blind parallel placebo control clinical trial evaluate efficacy pre-operative pregabalin ( lyrica ) ketamine eliminate phantom limb pain . Patient receive either pregabalin ketamine treatment ( Group 1 ) placebo ( Group 2 ) pre-operative period approximately 4 day ( 2-4 day ) . Patients identified anesthesia preoperative clinic orthopedic inpatient unit ( Parkland Hospital UT Southwestern University Hospital ) eligibility . Data base ( EPIC ) also use prescreening potential subject review clinic visit daily schedule operate room schedule . Then patient chart review initial data collection determine eligibility potential subject use HIPAA waiver form . Eligible subject approach study PI , investigator , research coordinator write consent obtain prior study procedure . A pregnancy test perform preoperative treatment start woman child-bearing age : exception include surgically sterile woman woman medically confirm menopause . Women positive pregnancy test report unprotected heterosexual sex since previous menses currently use and/or willing use medically approve form contraception ( e.g. , birth control pill ) enrol study . Pain document use visual analog pain score ( 0=no pain , 10=worst imaginary pain ) preoperative period treatment daily pain diary day surgery postoperative period PACU , 24 48 hr . long-term follow-up 1 , 3 , 6 month surgery . Total opioid dose 48-h study period document PCA pump morphine consumption postoperative first 24 hr . postoperative oral opioid usage 48 hr . surgery . Patients receive standard general anesthetic surgery postoperative standard care pain treatment similar patient . Study limit standard post-operative pain medication . Long-term analgesic success evaluate 1 , 3 , 6 month surgery . At follow-up period , pain diary use patient ' self-assessment pain occurrence , intensity , duration phantom stump pain , documentation oral analgesic usage . Analgesic medication use daily pain score document pain diary 1 month period follow surgery . At first follow-up visit , patient see Pain Clinic 1 month surgery . Patient call home 3 6 month surgery long-term follow-up . At all-time point , Self-Rating Depression Scale use assess depression patient complete Pain-Related Self-Statement Scale ( PRSS ) . The duration involvement study 6 month . Randomization : This randomized double-blinded placebo control clinical trial . Investigational Drug Pharmacy ( IDS ) randomize subject either treatment group placebo . IDS dispense drugs/placebo .</detailed_description>
