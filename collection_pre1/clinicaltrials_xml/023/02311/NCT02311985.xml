	<brief_title>Comparison Three Transfusion Strategies Central Venous Catheterization Cirrhotics : A Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central venous catheterization ubiquitous procedure intensive care unit mainly use drug administration , hemodynamic monitoring hemodialysis . Only US five million catheter insert annually . One main complication associate central venous line mechanical one , i.e . arterial puncture , bleed hematoma formation , vary 5 % 19 % . The use real-time ultrasonography accomplish central venous catheterization associate drastic reduction complication rate , perform trained personnel , series show complication rate &lt; 1 % , even patient coagulopathy . Patients present chronic liver failure complex coagulation system balance , result reduction majority procoagulant anticoagulant factor , oppose preservation thrombin generation . Thus , patient prone develop hemorrhagic thrombotic phenomenon . The coagulation cirrhotic patient classically evaluated standard coagulation test . Nevertheless , test present important limitation , evaluation plasmatic component , predict bleed risk . The thromboelastometry point-of-care real-time coagulation system evaluation advantage evaluate cellular plasmatic component coagulation present comprehensive evaluation blood coagulation , specially cirrhotics . This technology associate reduced cost diverse clinical setting . In clinical practice , approximately 90 % physician empirically transfuse blood component cirrhotic patient invasive procedure . This practice associate increase risk related blood transfusion per se , e.g . blood borne infection , immunologic non-immunologic adverse reaction , cite . Several randomized clinical trial show restrictive blood transfusion strategy associate well outcome , include mortality .</detailed_description>
