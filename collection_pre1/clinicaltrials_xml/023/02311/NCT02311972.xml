	<brief_summary>Very low birth weight ( VLBW ) infant ( &lt; 1500 gram birth ) low birth weight infant experience hypothermia birth stabilization ( first 24 hour life ) due inability keep warm metabolic heat production experience heat loss care . The investigator hypothesize insert InnerSense oral gastric tube ( Philips Healthcare ) imbed thermistor attach tube temperature monitor digital temperature display enable care-providers monitor continuous body temperature prompt provide warmth prevent heat loss , thus prevent hypothermia infant first 24 hour life . The investigator predict infant intervention group warmer axillary temperature upon admission NICU 1 , 4 , 8 hour age . Mothers non-active labor seek consent enroll VLBW infant study infant 's birth . 160 VLBW infant low birth weight infant 1000-2000 gram randomize intervention group ( placement InnerSense oral gastric tube thermistor Squirrel monitor continuous digital temperature display , immediately birth 24 hour life ) control group ( standard delivery room care stabilization care ) . The study staff plan enroll 180 infant ( 90 per group ) allow screen failure . Axillary temperature infant record NICU admission , 1 , 4 , 8 24 hour age . Further , study staff intend enroll approximately 300 Intensive Care Nursery provider care InnerSense study infant wish complete provider satisfaction survey . These provider ask provide consent prior complete survey name record separate study enrollment log . Infant demographic data compare make sure group significantly different . Temperatures intervention group compare control group use student test time point . Satisfaction questionnaires summarize described . The InnerSense oral gastric tube temperature monitor FDA approve use market commercially Philips Healthcare . VLBW infants oral gastric tube place standard care feeding , intermittently delivery room positive pressure ventilation necessary respiratory stabilization . There additional safety risk intervention study ; however , safety/data monitor committee form meet quarterly monitor trial .</brief_summary>
