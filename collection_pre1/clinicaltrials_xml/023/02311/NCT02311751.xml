	<brief_summary>In study , investigator examine effect repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) executive function deficit individual autism spectrum disorder . Half participant choose chance receive active rTMS stimulation half choose chance receive sham rTMS . Sham rTMS feel active rTMS direct brain stimulation . This necessary ensure active rTMS efficacious enhancement executive function individual autism spectrum disorder . Based result recently publish pilot study , investigator propose active rTMS treatment result significant improvement work memory performance compare sham rTMS treatment .</brief_summary>
