	<brief_title>Vagus Nerve Stimulation Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicenter study safety , biological activity clinical outcome active implantable VNS device patient active refractory CD . Patients sign inform consent prior screen undergo screen baseline assessment procedure include endoscopy endoscopic biopsy prior plan VNS implantation date . Those meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion consider enrol implant . After minimum 14 day follow implantation , patient first in-clinic visit ( Week 0 Visit ) , begin self-delivered once-daily stimulation use VNS device . Patients return weekly visit Weeks 1-4 , time outcome safety assessment take . At visit week 1 4 , attempt make increase output current maximum level tolerate . At Week 4 Visit , another attempt increase output current make daily stimulation time addition incremented 60 second 2 minute total . At Week 6 Visit safety outcomes assessment take another attempt increase output current make , daily stimulation time addition incremented 5 minute total . Patients return Week 8 , time safety outcomes assessment take . If patient achieve clinical remission CDAI , frequency stimulation increase daily 4 time daily . At Week 12 , patient return safety outcomes assessment . The final study visit Week 16 Visit , time patient final primary endpoint safety outcomes assessment , include follow-up endoscopy endoscopic biopsy . If patient terminate study prior week 16 , every effort make perform Week 16 Visit procedure Early Termination Visit . Patients complete study option enroll long-term extension study . If wish participate extension study opt either device permanently inactivate left place device surgically explanted .</detailed_description>
