	<detailed_description>Introduction In hip dysplasia acetabulum present shallow oblique insufficient coverage femoral head . Deformity femoral neck head common bilateral affection 54 % . The lack congruence acetabulum femoral head compromise passive stability hip joint result increase increased stress acetabular labrum , joint capsule muscle act close hip joint . The increased stress soft tissue result acetabular labrum injury 49-94 % patient hip dysplasia schedule joint preserving surgery . Left untreated hip dysplasia may lead development early osteoarthritis ; however , osteoarthritic process prevent delayed Periacetabular osteotomy ( PAO ) . Soft tissue injury present hip dysplasia , pathology iliopsoas muscle find 18-50 % . The muscle act close hip joint include deep fiber iliopsoas iliocapsularis muscle together acetabular labrum joint capsule able increase dynamic stabilisation femoral head dysplastic shallow acetabulum . The hip joint beside iliopsoas stabilise adductor gluteus medius muscle . Sustained hip pain immobilisation negative impact iliopsoas , psoas hip adductor term atrophy decrease hip muscle strength . In experimental study design find decreased force contribution gluteal muscle hip extension iliopsoas muscle hip flexion result increase anterior hip joint force . The increased anterior hip joint force may contribute anterior hip pain , subtle hip instability development anterior acetabular labral tear . Patients hip dysplasia less physical active prior PAO mainly due groin pain . A decreased physical activity level likely negative impact muscle act close hip joint possible increase risk sustain acetabular labrum injury and/or overuse related soft tissue pathology . After surgery , risk overuse related soft tissue pathology might increase due surgery impact muscle tendon . If possible demonstrate pathology hip muscle tendon apply clinical test , muscle strength test , ultrasonography , find sports-active people groin pain , make sense plan test specific training program focus pathological soft tissue pathology . The overall aim research project examine soft tissue pathology 100 patient hip dysplasia prior one year PAO . Material method Design Prospective cohort study 100 patient symptomatic radiologically verified hip dysplasia one year follow-up . Inclusion 1 . Diagnosis hip dysplasia Wiberg´s Center-Edge ( CE ) angle &lt; 25 degree , plan PAO surgery Aarhus University Hospital Exclusion 1 . Osteoarthritis grade ≥2 use Tönnis ' classification 2 . Other hip condition Calvé Perthes epiphysiolysis 3 . Surgery due discus disease spondylodesis joint preserve alloplastic surgery hip , knee angle region 4 . Neurological and/or rheumatological condition affect function hip joint 5 . Tenotomy iliopsoas tendon 6 . BMI &gt; 40 7 . Cross-over sign ( retroversion acetabulum ) Primary outcomes measure 1 . Soft tissue pathology abnormal clinical entity iliopsoas , adductor , rectus abdominis , gluteus medius hamstring use standardized reliable examination protocol 2 . Soft tissue pathology iliopsoas , adductor , rectus abdominis , gluteus medius hamstring use standardized ultrasonography protocol 3 . Hip related health measure reliable Copenhagen Hip Groin Outcome Score ( HAGOS ) validate patient groin pain 4 . Physical activity measure triaxial accelerometer period 7 day follow category : rest , stand , walk , sit stand ( STS ) , cycle run Secondary outcome measure 1 . Isometric hip muscle strength hip flexor , hip abductor , hip adductor hip extensor use reliable standardize method 2 . Subjective visual analogue scale ( VAS ) rest hip muscle strength test 3 . Pain location register pain-drawing 4 . Presence internal snap hip examine standardized examination test ultrasonography 5 . Presence intra-articular pathology examine Flexion/Abduction/External Rotation ( FABER ) Flexion/Adduction/Internal Rotation ( FADDIR ) test ultrasonography hip joint 6 . Presence lumbar thoracic back pathology examine reliable Spine Springing Tests spinous process processus transversi sacrum 7 . Conjoint tendon pathology examine palpation pubic tubercle ultrasonography pubic tubercle Procedure Patients include division hip surgery Aarhus University Hospital use list inclusion exclusion criterion 's . The patient complete HAGOS questionnaire inform write consent . Wiberg 's center-edge ( CE ) angle , Tönnis ' acetabular index ( AI ) angle , osteoarthritis grade measure anteroposterior radiograph inclusion surgery surgeon . Information hospital chart use record age , gender , unilateral bilateral involvement pathology . Baseline characteristic register use standardized question include data BMI , duration pain intake analgesia . Pain afterwards measure 100 mm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) rest sit lying , furthermore register pain drawing . Preferred physical activity hour spend primary overall physical activity register use standardized question . Ultrasonography carry first ultrasound scanner ( Noblus , Hitachi-Aloka Medical , Zug , Switzerland ) use 18 Megahertz ( MHz ) linear transducer.Then standardize examination protocol abnormal clinical entity carry . Examination pain conjoint tendon , presence lumbar thoracic back pathology , examination intra-articular pathology evaluation internal snapping hip follow . The hip muscle strength carry , finally physical activity sensor attach , patient inform monitor duration physical activity . One year postoperative follow examination carry listed order : HAGOS , baseline characteristic , pain VAS scale , pain pain drawing , hour physical activity , ultrasonography , abnormal clinical entity , pain conjoint tendon , presence lumbar thoracic back pathology , examination intra-articular pathology , evaluation internal snapping hip , hip muscle strength . Finally physical activity sensor attach patient inform . Statistics Stata 11 use statistic calculation , result present significant p &lt; 0.05 . Sample size The present study descriptive study aim describe musculotendinous pathology patient hip dysplasia . This mean power calculation feasible . On annual basis approximately 140 periacetabular osteotomy carry Aarhus University Hospital . Allowing lack participation 25 % seem possible include 100 patient period one year . Based , convenience sample 100 patient include describe musculotendinous pathology patient hip dysplasia . Ethics The study present local research ethic 14th January 2014 . The Committee waive request ethic approval , since study accord Danish law require approval owe observational design ( Request 5/2014 ) . All participant provide write consent prior inclusion , approval obtain Danish Data Protection Agency ( Reference number : 1-16-02-47-14 ) . Economy publicise Financial support apply internal external fund . Both positive negative result publish international journal present conference .</detailed_description>
