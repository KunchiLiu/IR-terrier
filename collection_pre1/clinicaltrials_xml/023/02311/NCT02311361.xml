	<brief_summary>Background : - Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) use treat cancer . It way give focused beam radiation tumor . Researchers think drug use study might work well use SBRT people pancreatic cancer . Objective : - To study safety effectiveness MEDI4736 and/or tremelimumab SBRT . Eligibility : - People 18 old pancreatic cancer respond chemotherapy . They must candidate radiation resection . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They blood test . Their tumor measure use computerize tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . - Participants tumor biopsied needle . They also biopsy cycle 1 . - Participants get 1 2 drug . - MEDI4736 therapy give 28-day cycle . Participants get drug intravenous ( IV ) infusion twice cycle . - For tremelimumab , therapy first 6 cycle last 28 day . Then cycle last 12 week . Participants get drug IV cycle . - All participant SBRT . Some get 1 dose radiation get 5 . CT scan map tumor . - Participants medical history , physical exam , blood test cycle . They CT scan MRI every 8 week . Cycles continue 12 month . - Participants contact yearly follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Checkpoint Inhibition ( Tremelimumab and/or MEDI4736 ) Combination With Radiation Therapy Patients With Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : -Tremelimumab monoclonal antibody CTLA4 . Anti-CTLA4 therapy show enhance anti-tumor immunity block tumor-induced immune suppression cytotoxic T cell . - MEDI4736 human monoclonal antibody direct PD-L1 . Blockage ligation PD-L1 PD1 induce local immune activation prevent anergy exhaustion effector T-cells . - Several study document increase peripheral antitumor immunity follow radiation . This effect evidently weak clinically relevant , potential boost immune modulation . - The underlying hypothesis study effect Immune Checkpoint inhibitor ( Tremelimumab and/or MEDI4736 ) treatment enhance radiation patient advance pancreatic carcinoma . Objective : To determine safety , tolerability feasibility immune checkpoint inhibition ( comprise either MEDI4736 alone ( Cohort A ) , Tremelimumab ( Cohort B ) combine MEDI4736 Tremelimumab ( Cohort C ) ] combination stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) patient unresectable pancreatic cancer . Eligibility : - Histologically confirm metastatic pancreatic cancer primary in-situ ( locallyrecurrent ) least 1 measurable metastatic lesion RECIST 1.1 criterion accessible biopsy . No prior radiation therapy pancreas allow . There limit number prior chemotherapy regimens receive . - Patients must great equal 18 year age performance status ( ECOG ) less equal 1 - Life expectancy great 3 month . - Acceptable organ bone marrow function . - Patients must standard care chemotherapy , radiotherapy , major surgery within last 2 week prior enter study . For recent experimental therapy 28 day period time must elapse commence protocol treatment . - No active prior document autoimmune inflammatory disorder ( include inflammatory bowel disease , diverticulitis exception diverticulosis , celiac disease , irritable bowel disease ; Wegner syndrome ; Hashimoto syndrome ; Graves disease ; rheumatoid arthritis , hypophysitis , uveitis , etc . ) within past 3 year prior start treatment . - No active history inflammatory bowel disease ( colitis , Crohn ) , irritable bowel disease , celiac disease , serious , chronic , gastrointestinal condition associate diarrhea . - No active history systemic lupus erythematosus , Wegener granulomatosis . Design : -3 separate cohort enrol sequentially : - Cohort A : anti-PDL1 ( MEDI4736 ) combination Radiation - Cohort B : anti-CTLA4 ( tremelimumab ) combination Radiation - Cohort C : anti-PDL1 ( MEDI4736 ) anti-CTLA4 ( tremelimumab ) combination Radiation . Cohort C proceed follow NCI IRB approval update safety information ongoing study evaluate tremelimumab combination MEDI4736 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histopathological confirmation pancreatic adenocarcinoma prior enter study OR histopathological confirmation carcinoma set clinical radiological characteristic , together pathology , consistent diagnosis pancreatic carcinoma . Patients must disease amenable potentially curative resection . Primary insitu ( locallyrecurrent ) tumor must present , opinion radiation oncology , amenable radiation therapy plan protocol . Each case discuss GI tumor board multidisciplinary team . Patients must least 1 measurable metastatic lesion RECIST1.1 criterion accessible biopsy . No prior radiation therapy pancreas allow . There limit number prior chemotherapy regimens receive . Patients must receive least one line prior systemic chemotherapy advance unresectable and/or metastatic disease . Age &gt; 18 year Life expectancy great 3 month . ECOG performance status 01 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/mcL Platelets great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin Bili le equal 2 x ULN ( patient Gilbert 's Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dL ) serum albumin great equal 2.5 g/dl Patients eligible ALT AST 3 x ULN . ( 5 x ULN liver metastasis present ) Creatinine &lt; 2X institution upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance &gt; 45 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) , patient creatinine level institutional normal Patients must recover acute toxicity relate prior therapy , include surgery . Toxicity less equal grade 1 return baseline . Patient must able understand willing sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Malignant ascites clinically detectable physical examination symptomatic . Evidence radiographic ascites clinically significant exclusion criterion . Any prior Grade great equal 3 irAE receive immunotherapy , include antiCTLA4 treatment , unresolved irAE &gt; Grade 1 . Note : Active history vitiligo basis exclusion . Patients must standard care chemotherapy , radiotherapy , major surgery within last 2 week prior enter study . Note : Local surgery isolate lesion palliative intent acceptable . For recent experimental therapy 28 day period time must elapse commence protocol treatment . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness , include , limited , ongoing active infection , current pneumonitis , symptomatic congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , interstitial lung disease , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement , substantially increase risk incur adverse event MEDI4736 tremelimumab , compromise ability subject give write informed consent .
