	<brief_summary>The aim phase II study test novel concept treatment patient myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPN ) , disease bone marrow . With current cure available , MPN group chronic leukemia ( blood cancer ) patient produce many blood cell . These increase blood cell number cause problem patient bleeding thrombosis patient may progress acute leukemia , life threaten condition . Most MPN patient gene mutation call JAK2-V617F . The disease maintain mutant MPN stem cell reside bone marrow specialize location call `` niche '' . These niche need connection nervous system . New finding show connection destroy presence mutate MPN stem cell . Research team find drug ( beta3-sympathicomimetics ) restore damage niche time reduce MPN disease manifestation mouse model MPN . Such sympathicomimetic drug already use treat patient asthma hyperactive bladder . These drug show side effect . The study test effect beta-3-sympathicomimetic drug Mirabegron ( Betmiga® ) MPN disease 39 patient carry JAK2-V617F mutation . The hypothesis Mirabegron beneficial effect bone marrow niche cell thereby improve disease manifestation MPN patient . This study provide rapid answer whether target nervous system niche cell could useful patient MPN warrant test large long-term study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DISEASE BACKGROUND Myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPN ) clonal stem cell disorder characterize aberrant proliferation erythroid , megakaryocytic myeloid lineage . They associate decreased survival , thromboembolic complication , hemorrhage inherent tendency towards leukemic transformation . About 4-6 100'000 resident per year diagnose MPN Currently , MPN subdivide three disease entity : polycythemia vera ( PV ) , essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) primary myelofibrosis ( PMF ) . Three gene frequently mutate MPN implicate phenotypic driver mutation : 95 % PV patient carry somatic JAK2-V617F mutation , half remain PV patient ( 2-3 % ) display mutation JAK2 exon 12 . Thus , almost patient PV somatic mutation JAK2 gene . The mutational profile ET PMF diverse : JAK2-V617F find 50-60 % patient , whereas recently describe mutation calreticulin ( CALR ) occur 20-25 % patient . Between 5-8 % remain ET PMF patient carry mutation thrombopoietin receptor ( MPL ) 10-15 % patient mutation remain determined . Quantitative test available follow mutant allele burden JAK2 , CALR MPL mutant allele . THERAPY BACKGROUND No curative treatment exist MPN , possibly exception allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) , applicable minority patient . Currently , treatment MPN effective , extremely costly . Hydroxyurea standard care many decade . A reduction thrombotic complication demonstrate `` high risk '' MPN patient ( age &gt; 60 , presence previous thrombotic event ) , hydroxyurea effect course disease ( remission substantial reduction mutant allele burden ) . Interferon alpha ( IFNα ) promise treatment early stage PV currently test phase III study . However , IFNα always well tolerated phase II study proportion patient show substantial response . Ruxolitinib , recently approve PMF splenomegaly , effective reduce spleen size improve quality life , little effect JAK2-V617F mutant allele burden far report induce remission . Allogeneic HSCT reserve patient PMF poor prognostic score . These include recently develop JAK2 inhibitor reduce symptom disease , , exception pegylated interferon alpha ( peg-IFNα ) , little effect size neoplastic clone unable induce molecular remission . Thus , percentage mutant allele burden hematopoietic cell change much even successful treatment consider symptom reduction . It generally expect reduction size malignant clone , surrogate marker treatment success , potential reduce morbidity result prolong survival patient . NOVEL TREATMENT The beta-3-sympathicomimetic drug Mirabegron currently available Betmiga® indicate treat hyperactive bladder . It available slow release tablet 25 mg 50 mg formulation . Sympathicomimetic drug know relax smooth muscle several area human body therefore used inhalation patient asthma described drug relax smooth muscle bladder treat urge incontinence . β3-Adrenoceptors mediate negative inotropic effect human ventricular cardiomyocytes , opposite β1- β2-adrenergic receptor . Unlike beta1/2-mimetics , significant cardiovascular side effect ( include hypertrophy ) , beta3-mimetics report protect hypertrophy associate risk tachycardia palpitation patient . Sympathicomimetic agonist patient JAK2-mutated MPN RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL MPN initiate maintain mutate hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) . The interplay MPN HSCs stem cell niche increasingly recognize crucial biology disease . Dr. Simon Méndez-Ferrer et al , previously demonstrate nestin-positive mesenchymal stem cell ( nestin+ MSCs ) within bone marrow niche innervate sympathetic nerve fiber important regulate normal HSCs . New finding Dr. Méndez-Ferrer 's laboratory show nestin+ MSCs strongly reduce bone marrow patient MPN . Furthermore , mouse model MPN express human JAK2-V617F mutation , effect find cause early glial sympathetic nerve damage apoptosis nestin+ MSCs trigger mutant HSCs . In vivo depletion nestin+ cell accelerate MPN progression . Conversely , MPN phenotype could reverse compensate sympathetic neuropathy treatment beta-3-sympathicomimetic drug . Mice JAK2-V617F driven MPN treat beta-3-sympathicomimetic agonist restore nestin+ MSCs number , also show correction thrombocytosis , neutrophilia , bone marrow fibrosis , efficiently reduce mutant hematopoietic progenitor number bone marrow peripheral blood . Thus , treatment beta-3 sympathicomimetic agonist correct damage inflict MPN clone stem cell niche lead dramatic improvement MPN phenotype . Therefore , beta-3 sympathicomimetic agonist represent promise novel therapeutic approach MPN target stem cell niche rather MPN clone . Considering widely use establish safety track record beta-3-sympathicomimetic drug , phase II study select test concept beneficial effect beta sympathicomimetic activity bone marrow niche cell effect disease manifestation MPN patient .</detailed_description>
