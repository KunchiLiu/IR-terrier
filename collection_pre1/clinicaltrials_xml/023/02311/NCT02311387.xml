	<brief_summary>Background : - Lassa fever similar disease cause fever , malaria yellow fever . People get Lassa fever mouse . A person get Lassa fever mouse urine droppings . When group researcher test mice Soromba , Mali , find many infected Lassa fever . Lassa fever may also pass body fluid ( like blood semen ) people infect Lassa fever . Researchers want study disease help government well protect health people Sibirila . Objectives : - To find many people Sibirila ever Lassa fever . Also , measure many people get disease every year . Eligibility : - People age 6 month old resident Soromba , Bamba , Banzana plan relocate within 1 year . Design : - Households randomly select participate study . - Participants 20 drop blood collect finger heel . - Participants ask age . They ask ever fever ever see mouse around home . - Researchers come back 1 year take another drop blood participant . Participants ask question . - If participant fever time year , go health center . Researchers collect drop blood test Lassa fever .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Seroprevalence Incidence Lassa Fever Rural Commune Sibirila , District Bougouni , Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Throughout West Africa many 300,000 people infect annually Lassa virus , result approximately 5,000 death . Most commonly , contact infected rodent host ( Mastomys natalensis ) , ingestion / inhalation virus laden particle source human infection . However , person-to-person transmission also well document result outbreak , especially nosocomial setting . Infection pregnancy , especially third trimester , particularly severe maternal mortality rate estimate 20 % fetal mortality rate near 100 % . A survey rodent capture village Soromba ( rural commune Sibirila , district Bougouni , Mali ) find 25 % Mastomys natalensis evidence Lassa virus infection . The purpose study determine proportion people previously expose Lassa virus , well one-year incidence infection three village within rural commune Sibirila , district Bougouni . We obtain 2 fingerstick blood sample ( approximately one year apart ) approximately 600 participant age great equal 6 month . Participants passively follow one year ask present local health center fever . Elucidation prevalence Lassa virus infection population live near Sibirila may help Malian authority improve surveillance and/or local diagnostics . Accurate identification Lassa virus infection human help reduce morbidity mortality live area . The incidence etiology vector-borne disease southern Mali relatively unknown . It possible use sample screen vector-borne disease use similar serological assay . Expanding test include filovirus , bunyavirus , alphaviruses flavivirus would greatly benefit knowledge circulate pathogen southern Mali well public health help reduce morbidity mortality live area .</detailed_description>
