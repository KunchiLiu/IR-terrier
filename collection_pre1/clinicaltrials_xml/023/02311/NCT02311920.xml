	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study safety best dose ipilimumab , nivolumab , combination temozolomide treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma gliosarcoma . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab nivolumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know combination well treatment glioblastoma gliosarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab and/or Nivolumab Combination With Temozolomide Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Gliosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum safe dose single-agent treatment ipilimumab , nivolumab combination give temozolomide maintenance treatment newly diagnose glioblastoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Collect record side effect profile single-agent treatment ipilimumab , nivolumab , combination give temozolomide maintenance phase newly diagnose glioblastoma . II . Perform pilot study immune cell within tumor sample , e.g . phenotyping tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) interrogate tumor tissue diagnostic tumor block . III . Report number patient alive 1 2 year start single-agent treatment ipilimumab , nivolumab , combination give temozolomide maintenance phase newly diagnose glioblastoma . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Within 5 week completion chemoradiation , patient receive temozolomide orally ( PO ) day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute every 4 week 4 course begin 3 month course 4 every 3 month 4 course absence unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Within 5 week completion chemoradiation , patient receive temozolomide PO day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive nivolumab IV 60 minute every 2 week 16 week every 2 week 48 week absence unacceptable toxicity . ARM III : Within 5 week completion chemoradiation , patient receive temozolomide PO day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 4 week 4 course nivolumab IV 60 minute every 2 week 64 week absence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month , every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
