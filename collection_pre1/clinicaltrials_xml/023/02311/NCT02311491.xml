	<brief_summary>Purpose : The project aim assess hard ceramic coating orthodontic archwires reduce slide resistance archwires bracket orthodontic treatment procedure . Participants : Up 80 subject recruit study . Subjects 10 year age 45 year old otherwise healthy subject previously diagnose malocclusion . Procedures ( method ) : Each subject receive experimental ( coat ) regular ( uncoated control ) orthodontic archwire ( AW ) 3-month treatment . The 3D digital image subject 's dentition record three time 0- , 6- 12-week visit . The AW remove retrieve 3-month trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nano-Crystalline Ceramic Coating Orthodontic Archwires</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In trial , nano-crystalline ceramic apply surface orthodontic archwires use ion beam assist deposition reduce slide resistance . Excessive slide resistance work tooth motion bracket slide along wire new position . These ceramic coating produce predictable outcome , require less force shorter treatment time . A limited clinical trial conduct demonstrate effect . The aim project assess clinical efficacy new archwires Stage 1 ( level align ) Stage 2 ( space closure ) orthodontic treatment use twin bracket . The work hypothesis reduction slide resistance bracket-wire interface allow effective tooth movement leveling , align , slide , minimize unwanted tooth movement lateral ( mesio-distal direction ) movement due friction . This test total 80 patient undergoing active treatment University North Carolina ( UNC ) orthodontic graduate clinic . These patient comprise treatment group ( coat ) control group ( uncoated ) 20 Stage 1 Stage 2 treatment . A successful program demonstrate clinically significant increase amount rate-of-change tooth movement leveling , align , slide teeth .</detailed_description>
