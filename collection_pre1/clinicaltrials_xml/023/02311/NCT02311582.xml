	<brief_summary>The blood brain barrier ( BBB ) major obstacle drug delivery treatment malignant brain tumor include Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . MRI-guided laser ablation ( MLA ) note disrupt peritumoral BBB , could lead increased access new tumor antigens lymphovascular system vice versa immune effector cell tumor effective activation immune system . Therefore combination MK-3475 MLA propose protocol hypothesize create therapeutic synergy MLA increase material access promote immune activation MK-3475 maximize tumor-specific immune reaction impart effective tumor control .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Phase I : Histologically confirm grade III IV malignant glioma . Phase II : Histologically confirm grade IV malignant glioma ( GBM ) . *Note : GBM variant secondary GBM allow phase I phase II . Unequivocal evidence tumor progression document biopsy brain MRI scan per RANO criterion . There must interval least 12 week completion standard front line therapy study registration unless unequivocal evidence tumor recurrence per RANO criterion . When interval le 12 week 4 week completion radiotherapy , use perfusion image and/or PET scan allow differentiate unequivocal evidence tumor recurrence pseudoprogression . Standard front line therapy describe : For grade IV malignant glioma ( GBM ) : Standard front line therapy newly diagnose GBM must include maximal feasible surgical resection ( biopsy alone allow ) , radiotherapy , temozolomide chemotherapy . If tumor initially diagnose either grade II III tumor recur progressed grade IV GBM , consider secondary recurrent grade IV GBM eligible study long prior treatment include maximal feasible surgical resection ( biopsy alone allow ) , radiotherapy , temozolomide chemotherapy . For grade III malignant gliomas 1p 19q codeletions : Standard front line therapy newly diagnose grade III malignant glioma must include maximal feasible surgical resection ( biopsy alone allow ) , radiotherapy , chemotherapy ( PCV temozolomide ) . If patient receive component standard front line therapy detail newly diagnose grade III glioma tumor recur progress , s/he must first receive least one prior standard therapy appropriate combination component standard therapy detailed must experience recurrence progression s/he deem eligible study . If tumor initially diagnose grade II glioma 1p 19q codeletions recur progressed grade III tumor , consider secondary recurrent grade III glioma 1p 19q codeletions eligible study long prior treatment include maximal feasible surgical resection ( biopsy alone allow ) , radiotherapy , chemotherapy ( PCV temozolomide ) . For grade III malignant glioma without 1p 19q codeletions : Standard front line therapy newly diagnose grade III malignant glioma must include maximal feasible surgical resection ( biopsy alone allow ) , radiotherapy , temozolomide chemotherapy . If tumor initially diagnose grade II glioma without 1p 19q codeletions recur progressed grade III tumor , consider secondary recurrent grade III glioma without 1p 19q codeletions eligible study long prior treatment include maximal feasible surgical resection ( biopsy alone allow ) , radiotherapy , temozolomide chemotherapy . Candidate MLA base size , location , shape recurrent tumor determine perform neurosurgeon . Surgical resection/debulking prior MLA allow per standard care require ; patient undergoes resection debulking , must occur least 3 week prior first dose MK3475 . For Phase II : surgical resection/debulking prior MLA indicate , biopsy tumor do time MLA obtain tumor tissue diagnostic purpose immune monitoring . Patients undergone gross total resection recurrence eligible , MLA direct treat peritumoral margin 0.51cm surround resection cavity disrupt BBB potentially increase access MK3475 peritumoral infiltrate glioma cell .

Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . Prior treatment antiangiogenic agent ( include bevacizumab ) . Prior treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , anticytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 ( CTLA4 ) antibody ( include ipilimumab antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation checkpoint pathway ) . Prior treatment monoclonal antibody within 4 week prior first dose MK3475 recover ( i.e . ≤ grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior first dose MK3475 recover ( i.e . ≤ grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : patient ≤ grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : patient underwent major surgery , s/he must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Candidates curative resection urgent surgical procedure ( ) need . Presence infratentorial lesion , brainstem lesion , lesion less 5 mm hyophysis cranial nerve . Multifocal gliomas bilateral . Patients unilateral multifocal glioma may eligible multifocal disease treat effectively safely single MLA procedure . Presence leptomeningeal metastasis . Required escalating dos corticosteroid equivalent ≥ 4 mg dexamethasone daily within 2 week prior enrollment . Recent ( within 8 week ) history CNS hemorrhage unless hemorrhage locate within tumor remove en total surgical debulking ablate MLA . Requires therapeutic dos anticoagulant unless anticoagulation safely discontinue surgery per standard practice ( e.g . first DVD anticoagulation least 3 month repeat image demonstrates resolution DVT ) IVC filter use place anticoagulation . Subjects permit resume anticoagulation follow surgery per discretion treat physician and/or site SOPs Received prior local therapy ( stereotactic radiosurgery , brachytherapy , carmustine wafer ) propose area MLA treatment . Received live vaccine within 30 day prior first dose MK3475 . Currently receive investigational agent participate study investigational agent use investigational device within 3 week first dose MK3475 .
