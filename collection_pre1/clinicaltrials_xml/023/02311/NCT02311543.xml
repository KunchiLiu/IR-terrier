	<brief_title>Impact Surgical Sealing Patch Lymphatic Drainage After ALND Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DISEASE BACKGROUND In Switzerland , 5'500 woman 30 40 men diagnose breast cancer every year . It account one third cancer diagnose among woman , cause approximately 1'350 death per year . Around 1'200 patient per year need axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND ) part surgical treatment . ALND indicate primarily node-positive breast cancer . Patients identify either pre-operative evaluation axilla intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) . THERAPY BACKGROUND During axillary lymph node dissection breast cancer , standard technique prevention leakage dissect lymphatic vessel include application suture ligament use bipolar electrocautery . Seroma prevention ALND achieve placement close suction drain skin axillary cavity . Closed axillary suction drain archaic tool prevent seroma ALND simple mechanical drainage cost significant patient discomfort increase length hospital stay . The seal agent TachoSil® ( consist equine collagen sponge coat human fibrinogen human thrombin ) allow nuanced approach management axillary seroma prevention may support ongoing decades-old effort professional breast cancer community decrease duration axillary drainage finally , abandon drain routine clinical practice . RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL Axillary lymph node dissection remain integral part surgical treatment primarily node-positive invasive breast cancer . In order reduce incidence clinically relevant seroma , suction drain routinely place axillary cavity ALND separate stab incision . Indeed , recent meta-analysis 6 randomize control trial ( RCT 's ) axillary drainage versus axillary drainage similar meta-analysis 6 RCT 's volume-controlled versus no/short-term drainage demonstrate significant reduction seroma risk use axillary drainage . Importantly , however , majority patient trial develop seroma even absence axillary drainage . The reduction seroma risk axillary drainage trial achieve expense prolonged hospital stay significant patient discomfort cause drain . During past 4 decade least 50 RCT 's perform various intervention reduce axillary drainage aim abandon axillary drain clinical practice . The intervention range surgical dead space reduction , use various surgical equipment , shoulder immobilization , compression dressing , application somatostatin analogons medication . Due overall limit success trial axillary drainage still standard care ALND . The pathogenesis seroma involve collection lymph fluid cause dissection lymph vessel exudate . All coagulation fibrinolytic factor produce secrete lymphatic endothelial cell involve seal lymphatic capillary . Local hemostyptic agent may therefore reduce postoperative secretion lymphatic fistula cause ALND . However , result trial use fibrin sealant axillary cavity ALND conflicting . While show favorable impact fibrin sealant , others demonstrate promising result use fibrin glue . Consequently , meta-analysis 11 RCT 's 632 patient show impact use fibrin glue ALND risk seroma length hospital stay , reveal trend toward less drainage volume ( weighted mean difference - 117.7 , 95 per cent confidence interval - 259.2 23.8 ml ) . In study , however , liquid form fibrin sealant use . The use TachoSil® , non-liquid surgical patch , show strongly reduce lymphatic drainage lymphadenectomy gynecologic urologic procedure prevent development chylothorax patient underwent heart surgery intraoperative lymphatic leakage . We propose conduct multicenter prospective RCT Switzerland evaluate impact TachoSil® axillary drainage ALND breast cancer . We hypothesize use TachoSil® significantly relevantly reduce volume duration axillary drainage ALND . This potential increase patient ' quality life , well shorten length hospital stay reduce hospital cost , provide rationale clinical relevance propose RCT . If propose RCT show minimum 33 % relative drainage reduction , follow-up trial justified . The follow-up trial conduct patient receive TachoSil® randomization versus without axillary drainage . Therefore , final goal omission axillary drainage ALND future .</detailed_description>
