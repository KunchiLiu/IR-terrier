	<brief_summary>Trans-palmitoleic acid ( trans-C16:1 ) naturally occur trans fatty acid present small quantity food , notably dairy product . Observational evidence suggest positive association trans-C16:1 insulin sensitivity , negative association risk develop type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 1-3 ] . Cis-palmitoleic acid ( cis-C16:1 ) find naturally food particularly high macadamia nut oil extract sea buckthorn plant . Animal model suggest palmitoleic acid isomer also improve insulin sensitivity reduce metabolic dysfunction . This pilot dose study necessary inform design large trial test hypothesis trans-C16:1 cis-C16:1 improve insulin resistance different dos . Plasma phospholipid fatty acid profile use primary outcome measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The fatty acid trans-C16:1 cis-C16:1 associate healthy plasma glucose level . Elevated glucose level associate diabetes . This study design determine whether dose-response relation much trans-C16:1 cis-C16:1 consume much appear plasma . This information use design future study determine whether trans-C16:1 cis-C16:1 could use treat diabetes . Trans-C16:1 occurs naturally dairy fat milk cheese , cis-C16:1 occurs naturally nut , particularly , macadamia nut , plant call sea buckthorn . The study consist two 9-week phase , minimum 4 week off-study period two phase . Fasting blood drawn baseline ( first day week 1 ) , 3 week , 6 week 9 week ( 4 total blood draw per phase 8 total blood draw 2 phase ) . During phase ask consume increase number vegetable oil capsule , 2 per day first 3 week , 4 per day second 3 week , 8 per day third 3 week . During period take half capsule morning half evening , meal . You randomly assign receive trans-C16:1 cis-C16:1 first phase second phase . The total length study 18 week , include break phase 1 phase 2 ( less 4 week ) . The trans-C16:1 capsule form partially-hydrogenated soybean oil . The cis-C16:1 capsule form sea buckthorn oil .</detailed_description>
