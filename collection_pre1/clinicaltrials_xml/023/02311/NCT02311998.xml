	<brief_summary>There 2 part study : Part 1 ( dose escalation ) Part 2 ( dose expansion ) . The goal Part 1 clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination bosutinib inotuzumab ozogamicin give patient Ph+ ALL CML lymphoid blast phase also express CD22 . The goal Part 2 learn dose find Part 1 help control disease . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study Bosutinib Combination With Inotuzumab Ozogamicin CD22-positive Philadelphia-Chromosome ( PC ) Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL ) Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ( CML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study whether receive earlier treatment leukemia . Up 36 participant enrol Part 1 study , 44 participant enrol Part 2 . If enrol Part 1 , dose bosutinib receive depend join study treatment history . The first group participant treatment history group receive low dose level bosutinib . Each new group receive high dose bosutinib group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose bosutinib find . If enrol Part 2 , receive bosutinib high dose tolerate Part 1 . All participant Parts 1 2 receive dose inotuzumab ozogamicin . Study Drug Administration : You take bosutinib tablet mouth 1 time day food . If miss vomit dose bosutinib , take `` make '' dose . Wait take next dose schedule next day . You also receive inotuzumab ozogamicin vein 1 hour Days 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle . If doctor think need , may switch different dose schedule receive inotuzumab ozogamicin 1 time every 4 week . The doctor discus . You give standard drug ( acetaminophen/paracetamol , antihistamine , and/or steroid ) help decrease risk side effect . If doctor think need , may also receive hydroxyurea control white blood cell count study . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle Days 8 15 Cycle 1 : - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You physical exam . On Day 8 Cycle 1 , exam . You may routine blood draw perform local lab clinic closer home . The result send study doctor review . On Day 1 Cycles 2-6 , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check status disease CD22 testing . If disease appear get good , test every 2 cycle . After Cycle 6 , test every 3 month time doctor think need . Length Treatment : You may take inotuzumab ozogamicin 6 cycle . You may continue take bosutinib long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study 1 year follow-up call . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 28 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test CD22 test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check status disease CD22 testing . If come MD Anderson clinic visit , call member study staff ask side effect may . This call last 5 minute . Follow-Up : After end-of-treatment visit call , call 1 time every 12 week ( 1 year ) ask anti-cancer therapy may start . This call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Inotuzumab ozogamicin FDA-approved commercially available . Bosutinib FDA-approved commercially available treatment certain type CML patient fail previous therapy . It consider investigational use combination drug treat Ph+ AML/CML . Up 80 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
