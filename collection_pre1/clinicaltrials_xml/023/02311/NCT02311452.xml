	<brief_summary>Some child get serious bacterial infection require hospitalization long course antibiotic completely treat infection . Examples serious infection include rupture appendicitis ( appendix get inflamed burst , release bacteria abdomen ) , complicate pneumonia ( infected pocket pu form either lung lung chest wall ) , osteomyelitis ( infection bone ) . To extend duration antibiotic therapy discharge hospital , doctor often insert long catheter call PICC line child 's vein , stay body several week . However , PICC line require fair amount maintenance training caregiver use , require child restrict activity , lead serious complication , blood stream infection clot . An alternative PICC line extend duration antibiotic therapy oral antibiotic ( pill syrup ) achieve high level medicine blood extra work , inconvenience risk PICC line . Unfortunately , high quality study demonstrate oral antibiotic good intravenous antibiotic deliver via PICC line , many doctor still recommend PICC line treatment option . Also , study do compare impact two treatment option quality life child caregiver . In proposal investigator outline series project compare oral antibiotic vs. intravenous antibiotic deliver via PICC line child require prolong ( least 1 week ) home antibiotic therapy hospitalization three different serious bacterial infection : rupture appendicitis , complicate pneumonia , osteomyelitis . To see whether oral antibiotic good PICC line , investigator use data collect 15,000 child one three infection hospitalize one 43 US child 's hospital year 2009-2011 , determine whether PICC line result few rehospitalizations treatment failure oral therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness Intravenous v. Oral Antibiotic Therapy Serious Bacterial Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : When clinician want prescribe prolong antibiotic therapy child hospitalize serious bacterial infection two option : ( 1 ) discontinue intravenous antibiotic discharge child receive prolonged course oral antibiotic home ; ( 2 ) insert central venous catheter ( usually peripherally inserted central catheter ( PICC ) ) , train parent care PICC administration intravenous antibiotic , discharge child receive prolonged course intravenous antibiotic via central venous catheter home . These two option major implication overall experience child caregiver , paucity evidence comparative effectiveness help clinician , patient , caregiver make informed choice . Objectives : In proposal investigator outline series project compare oral antibiotic vs. intravenous antibiotic deliver via central venous catheter child require prolong ( least 1 week ) home antibiotic therapy hospitalization three different serious bacterial infection : perforate appendicitis , complicate pneumonia , osteomyelitis . Methods : To compare clinical effectiveness two treatment option , investigator conduct three separate retrospective comparative effectiveness study diseases use detailed electronic data diagnosis , procedure , laboratory test , order drug device supplement limited chart review 43 free stand child 's hospital member Children 's Hospital Association ( CHA ) ( study year 2009-2011 , total sample size exceed 15,000 child ) . The primary outcome rehospitalization treatment failure . The investigator use conventional propensity-score base method , include matching , estimate compare effect two treatment option patient outcomes . These comparison goal ask effect therapy patient randomize one two treatment option .</detailed_description>
