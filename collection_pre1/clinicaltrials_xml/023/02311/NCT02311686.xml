	<brief_title>Non-oxidative Metabolite Profiles After Increasing Doses Ethanol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The abuse alcohol cause serious health social problem . Alcohol consumption monitor detect biomarkers . In current practice indirect biomarkers ( mean corpuscular volume , transaminase , gammaglutamyl carbohydrate-deficient transferrin ) use , although direct biomarkers alcohol , include alcohol metabolite also exist . Biomarkers alcohol consumption use tool prevent health social problem related alcohol , allow identification subject risk abuse , dependence withdrawal ass efficacy treatment alcohol dependence . Non-oxidative metabolite ( ethyl glucuronide , ethyl sulphate fatty acid ethyl ester ) longer biological half-life ethanol accumulate tissue consumption . The objective study study profile ethanol non-oxidative biomarkers ( ethyl glucuronide , ethyl sulphate fatty acid ethyl ester ) experimental administration increase dos alcohol adult subject . Subjects genotyped genetic polymorphism protein related ethanol metabolism effect ( alcohol dehydrogenase aldehyde dehydrogenase ) , genotype use evaluate influence result .</detailed_description>
