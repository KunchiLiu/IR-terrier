	<brief_summary>This study phase II , prospective , open-label , single arm , single center study efficacy safety concurrent conventional transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) sorafenib patient hepatocellular carcinoma extrahepatic metastasis . All 55 patient hepatocellular carcinoma newly diagnose extrahepatic ( lung , bone , lymph node , adrenal gland ) metastasis include . On demand conventional TACE perform patient enrollment continue intrahepatic CR , TACE failure consent withdrawal . Sorafenib start 3-7 day first subsequent TACE stop one day next TACE continue sorafenib failure , consent withdrawal condition worsen clinical decision . Repeated on-demand TACE sorafenib continue criterion treatment discontinuation meet . After initiation sorafenib combination treatment , patient see perform routine examination week 4 , routine examination follow every 6 ± 2 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Concurrent TACE Sorafenib Patients With HCC Extrahepatic Metastasis ( COTSOM Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , single arm , prospective , phase II study patient metastatic HCC . A total 55 patient HCC newly diagnose extrahepatic ( lung , bone , lymph node , adrenal gland ) metastasis enrol . On demand conventional TACE perform patient enrollment continue intrahepatic CR , TACE failure consent withdrawal . Safety evaluate every 6 ± 2 week initial TACE close monitoring unscheduled visit do well . The efficacy TACE evaluate every 6 ± 2 week session TACE use dynamic CT MRI . Performance repeat TACE decide base finding follow-up CT , patient ' liver function performance status , within 6 ± 2 week previous TACE . Patients residual viable tumor previous TACE indicate TACE evaluate routine examination image study every 6 ± 2 week . Safety evaluate ongoing basis within 3 day next TACE . All eligible patient give sorafenib ( initially 400mg po bid ) day 3-7 first every session TACE , sorafenib stop one day TACE . Sorafenib continue sorafenib failure , consent withdrawal condition worsen clinical decision . Treatment failure judge evaluation intra- extrahepatic lesion separately . TACE failure define TACE/transarterial chemo-lipiodolization ( TACL ) benefit clinical assessment judge clinically one investigator and/or patient eligible worsen ECOG PS liver function . Detailed criterion stop TACE clarify . Sorafenib failure evaluate modified RECIST apply extrahepatic lesion , sorafenib stop progressive disease ( PD ) mRECIST extrahepatic lesion indicate clinical benefit TACE expect intrahepatic lesion . As long TACE evaluate beneficial plan perform investigator , sorafenib could continue side effect tolerable . When treatment discontinuation criterion meet , test treatment stop . Survival post-treatment information collect 1-3 month interval last study visit endpoint death , subject become lose follow-up study termination Principal Investigator . Additional palliative anti-cancer therapy cytotoxic chemotherapy TACL without gelfoam embolization palliative radiation therapy allow record .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients HCC newly diagnose extrahepatic metastasis meeting follow criterion 1 . Clinical histological diagnosis HCC base guideline : Early enhancement follow late washout dynamic liver imaging ( CT MRI ) Or Pathological examination liver biopsy 2 . Evidence extrahepatic metastasis follow method ; CT , MRI , bone scan , positron emission tomography FDGPET , biopsy metastatic lesion 3 . Preserved liver function classify ChildPugh A 4 . ECOG PS 01 5 . Age least 20 year 6 . Patients able comply schedule visit , evaluation plan , study procedure 7 . Patient willing provide write informed consent 8 . There limitation prior TACE session number case TACE still consider beneficial 9 . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test perform within 14 day start treatment . All patient childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measure course trial ( barrier method birth control ) least 30 day last dose . Presence follow criterion 1 . Patients diagnose eligible TACE screen 2 . Patients advance liver disease define : Child Pugh B C Encephalopathy Ascites 3 . Complete occlusion main portal vein ( PV ) HCC 4 . Patients brain metastasis 5 . Inadequate liver function could perform TACE : AST &gt; 5 X ULN ( upper limit normal ) ALT &gt; 5 X ULN Total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL Prothrombin time INR &gt; 1.7 6 . Inadequate bone marrow function ( absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,500/μL , Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) &lt; 8 g/dL , platelet count &lt; 50,000/μL ) 7 . Inadequate renal function ( creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN ) 8 .

Investigational drug molecular target drug ongoing complete &lt; 4 week prior screen 11 . Clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 4 week prior start study drug 12 . Uncontrolled bleeding varix . 13 . History cardiac disease : Congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA class 2 Active coronary artery disease ( CAD ) ( myocardial infarction 6 month prior study entry allow ) Unstable angina ( anginal symptom rest ) , newonset angina within 3 month screen Cardiac arrhythmia poorly control antiarrhythmic therapy require pace maker Uncontrolled hypertension 14 . Active clinically serious infection except HBV HCV infection 15 . Patients HIV 16 .
