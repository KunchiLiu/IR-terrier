	<detailed_description>Background : Esophageal cancer ( EC ) 8th common cancer 6th common cause death cancer worldwide . Golestan province locate Northern Iran know high-risk area esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) . Recent report suggest increase rate esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) region well . Designing implement screen program may effective control cancer . The investigator aim develop screen program esophageal cancer region . The pilot phase project , Golestan EC Screening Program ( GESP ) , conduct 2011 2012 among 300 asymptomatic participant Golestan Cohort Study ( GCS ) , prospective population-based cohort 50,045 individual , age 40-75 year baseline , eastern half Golestan Province , Iran . The initial result GESP project show low participation rate endoscopic screening . In word , endoscopic ESCC screen feasible population , suggest need non-endoscopic screen method . Further result GESP project suggest capsule sponge cytology feasible valid primary method ESCC screen region . Because promising finding GESP project , decide start main phase EC screen program , call `` Non-endoscopic EC Screening Program Northern Iran ( NESP ) '' . The aim study assess effect implementation non-endoscopic EC screen program outcome interest asymptomatic high-risk population Golestan Province , Iran . Methods : For sample size calculation , investigator consider different scenario base publish literature unpublished data . The prevalence high grade dysplasia general population Golestan estimate 1.4-3.6 % . The sensitivity cytological detection esophageal squamous dysplasia ( ESD ) predict 46 % base study China , 60-100 % base study Iran , accord previous study , 27-65 % ESD lesion progress invasive ESCC without treatment . The investigator use rather conservative assumption calculate sample size : dysplasia prevalence 1.5 % , 60 % sensitivity sponge cytology , 2 % progression invasive ESCC screen ( treat ) group vs. 40 % untreated group . The investigator also assume power 90 % , mean cluster size 28 base PolyIran study ( CV=0.84 % ) , intra-class correlation ( ICC ) 0.01 . Based assumption investigator need 4980 people arm . So , investigator need enroll 9,960 GCS participant &gt; 50 year old . Estimating 20 % lack consent , final invitation list NESP project consist 12000 GCS participant include 6000 subject intervention ( capsule sponge ) arm 6000 subject control arm . A list 12000 subject GCS participant prepare . Sampling do use cluster randomization method . Each village consider cluster . Clusters randomly allocate two group , intervention group ( group 1 ) control group ( group 2 ) . Capsule sponge examination perform subject intervention cluster . But , participant control cluster enrol without capsule sponge examination . Both intervention control subject offer endoscopy develop upper GI symptom accord current clinical practice . The process data collection sampling perform community level . The NESP enrollment team go healthcare house locate village data collection sample do . After obtain informed consent , structure questionnaire include data demographic , socioeconomic status medical history complete subject . Subjects also ask fill quality life ( QOL ) questionnaire . The investigator use validated Persian version WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire basically develop WHO . Then capsule sponge examination perform subject community clinic overnight fast . The cytological specimen place preservative fluid transfer histopathology lab . Cytological specimen process paraffin block , slide prepare paraffin block stain use hematoxylin eosin ( H &amp; E ) method . Cytological examination capsule sponge H &amp; E slide do expert pathologist . The result report accord Bethesda system . All subject cytological diagnosis atypia refer Atrak clinic ( central clinic upper gastrointestinal disease Gonbad , Iran ) endoscopic examination . Endoscopic examination Lugol 's iodine staining perform previously describe method biopsy take abnormal lesion . Histological examination endoscopic biopsy sample do expert pathologist . If result endoscopic examination show high-grade dysplasia cancer , subject refer treatment . These subject treat endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) and/or radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) . Participants follow annually accord protocol GCS follow-up . Each subject annually contact telephone call , question subject 's vital status cancer incidence ask subject first-degree relative . In addition , official data subject 's vital status obtain death registry unit Department Health Golestan University Medical Sciences . Data cancer incidence study subject also obtain Golestan population-based cancer registry . Both group follow 5 year . At end study , QOL questionnaire complete available subject . The risk develop outcome compare intervention control group . Odds ratios 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) calculate . Survival analysis do assess survival rate sponge control group . The log rank test use compare survival rate two group . Hazard ratios 95 % CI calculate different variable use Cox regression analysis . Changes QOL score 5 year follow-up period compare sponge control group .</detailed_description>
