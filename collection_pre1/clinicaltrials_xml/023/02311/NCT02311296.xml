	<brief_summary>Ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) common problem among ICU patient major source infection among patient receive mechanical ventilation . Patients mechanical ventilation accumulate secretion lead aspiration infected secretion . Using new generation endotracheal tube ( Hi-Lo tube ) reduce incidence VAP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced Ventilator-Free Days Bacterial Colonization Sub-Glottic Secretions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient secrete fluid upper airway base tongue related structure . These `` subglottic '' secretion normally clear swallowing , person require mechanical ventilation process block breathe tube subglottic secretion tend accumulate . The removal subglottic secretion important bacteria normally inhabit back throat enter ultimately colonize collect pool subglottic secretion . This process call `` micro-aspiration '' show strong risk factor development Ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) . Previously , doctor nurse would attempt limit secretion pass small suction tube breathe tube , find ineffective increase risk bleed lung injury . A new development management patient require mechanical ventilation Hi-Lo endotracheal tube . This device `` suction port '' either side tube allow removal accumulate subglottic secretions.The standard care use Hi-Lo ET tube remove subglottic secretion every 4-6 hour . The Hi-Lo tube design minimize suction relate trauma . Moreover , recent study ET tube show regular suctioning reduces incidence VAP . When `` colonize '' secretion treat antibiotic , reduce number VAP shorten time breathe machine . The observation treatment bacterial colonization subglottic secretion reduce time breathing machine potentially important clinically . In study , propose development bacterial colonization directly contribute respiratory failure lead long time ventilator . The primary aim study could lead reduce time patient need mechanical ventilation . Recent study identify group `` protective protein '' call heat shock protein ( HSP ) appear protect patient develop pneumonia . The protective effect protein even pronounce patient require mechanical ventilation . Under stressed condition , HSPs secrete release subglottic secretion level secretion sufficient appear prevent bacteria `` colonize '' upper respiratory tract . In addition look rate bacterial colonization secretion , portion secretion measure amount HSP whether reduce secretion lead prolonged time ventilator .</detailed_description>
