	<brief_title>Uterine Cavity Assessment Endometrial Gene Expression Tamoxifen Treated Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer prevalent malignancy amongst woman approximately 13 % newly diagnose breast cancer patient diagnose age 20-34 [ 1 ] . At age group woman peak reproductive year , many yet complete family planning . Moreover age first birth steadily increase develop nation [ 2 ] quarter delivery woman age 35 . Despite repeated report literature bad prognosis young breast cancer patient , new treatment none-the-less improved outcome amongst young woman early stage disease subtypes outcome similar old woman [ 3,4 ] . These increase number breast cancer survivor concern post-cancer quality life issue , ability child complete treatment [ 5-6 ] , hence critical discus fertility preservation ability conceive breast cancer diagnose [ 7-9 ] . Treatment early breast cancer involve local therapy include surgery adjuvant radiation therapy well systemic therapy include chemotherapy , biological therapy hormonal therapy . Chemotherapy protocols breast cancer include different combination alkylating agent , platinum derivates taxanes toxic ovary , destroy primordial follicle stockpile , directly represent ovarian reserve result infertility premature menopause [ 10-12 ] . Tamoxifen Citrate , Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator ( SERM ) , compete estrogen bind site Estrogen Receptor ( ER ) target tissue breast . The drug use 30 year proven high therapeutic index significant efficacy . The drug effective reduce breast cancer recurrence improve patient 's survival across age group . The drug effective young pre-menopausal breast cancer patient [ 13-15 ] . Recently , report ( 16 ) breast cancer survivor take tamoxifen ten year half risk die estrogen receptor positive breast cancer . Therefore new ASCO ( American Society Clinical Oncology ) recommendation increase period tamoxifen treatment . However , period patient conceive , order enable pregnancy patient hold Tamoxifen treatment , either complete termination , ( suitable option new recommendation ) tamoxifen free window allow pregnancy offer . If ovarian function preserve woman try get spontaneous pregnancy . In patient suffer ovarian failure post chemotherapy treatment embryos ( egg ) store diagnosis fertility preservation procedure use . Pregnancies post ( even ) tamoxifen treatment report former breast cancer patient achieve low pregnancy rate perform embryo transfer embryo frozen prior treatment . The chance conceive post tamoxifen treatment even prolong Tamoxifen treatment determine . This become major importance limit window time allow conception . The risk develop endometrial cancer post-menopausal woman take tamoxifen well establish well incidence endometrial thicken endometrial adhesion polyp ( 17 ) . There available data whether change endometrium may induce Tamoxifen impairs ability conceive . Ultrasound assessment endometrium patient treat tamoxifen limited often inconclusive mainly due sub-endometrial ultrasonographic finding impair evaluation . The incidence endometrial adhesion polyps premenopausal breast cancer patient treat tamoxifen unknown . However abnormality interfere success future conception . The human endometrium dynamic tissue undergoes physiological clinical change menstrual cycle . Adhesion embryo endometrium possible short period time , endometrium acquire functional ability become receptive . This functionality pre- requisite successful pregnancy . It assume inadequate uterine receptivity responsible approximately two-thirds implantation failure . Although many fertility disorder overcome variety assist reproductive technique , implantation remain rate-limiting step success vitro fertilization . As mentioned previously , Tamoxifen may affect endometrium , however study regard effect change chance become pregnant . Furthermore , tamoxifen effect endometrial receptivity investigate yet . Although date single , clinically relevant morphologic , molecular , histologic marker capable indicate endometrial receptivity status identify . Few gene find associate implantation could act potential marker receptivity use compare endometrial receptivity patient previously treat Tamoxifen normal population . The research use several gene proven high correlation implantation process endometrial receptivity . Aims study : The aim multi-center study assess effect Tamoxifen uterine cavity endometrial abnormality young premenopausal woman diagnose breast cancer . The research contain two part : clinical study laboratory study . - In clinical part goal evaluate association tamoxifen treatment uterine abnormality . - The laboratory study 's target investigate effect Tamoxifen treatment endometrial tissue , explore molecular aspect endometrial receptivity</detailed_description>
