	<brief_summary>Background : - Genes instruction body use function . Researchers look change , variant , gene . The goal study find new gene change lead lipid disorder . Older research method look one gene time . Genomic sequence look gene . Genomic sequencing may find cause researcher able find past method . Objectives : - To good understand genetic cause lipid disorder genomic sequencing . Eligibility : - People age 2 old unusual lipid disorder , relative . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They blood take . They may give saliva sample . - Based screening test , researcher choose 3 5 family member perform genomic sequencing . The sequence do sample DNA collect blood draw saliva sample . - Participants may invite take part protocol may involve image heart blood vessel . They participate . If , sign separate consent test . - If participant family member travel NIH , NIH document consent review teleconference . A blood sputum kit mail .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary purpose discovery protocol identify new lipid gene subject rare genetic lipid disorder . We take advantage new technology whole exome sequence find cause dyslipidemia able find use past method . We work geneticist review sequence data unexpected gene change ( incidental finding ) explain lipid disorder gene change cause medical disorder rare form cancer heart disease . The opportunity participate Clinical Center Genomics Opportunity ( CCGO ) program enable u take advantage expertise rare lipid disorder translate knowledge new diagnostics therapy , key mission NIH .</detailed_description>
