	<brief_summary>Regular exercise several positive health effect include increased physical fitness muscle mass . It well know increased muscle mass associate increase rest energy expenditure may facilitate weight loss maintenance . Previous study , however , fail show consistent association intensity physical exercise energy expenditure , relate variance adaptation genetic variability . Whether high-intensity exercise ( HIE ) associate improved health relate quality life severely obese patient remain unknown . This PhD-project base plan randomise control study include 50 treatment seek morbidly obese patient randomise either 24 week moderate-intensity exercise ( MIE ) programme 24 week high-intensity exercise ( HIE ) programme . The investigator main hypothesis patient randomise HIE-program achieve high energy expenditure rest physical activity treatment allocate MIE-programme . In addition , investigator hypothesise HIE-group achieve good health relate quality life MIE-group treatment . The investigator also hypothesize inter-individual variability adaptation two training regimen may due genetic factor . If investigator hypothesis confirm , project might beneficial clinical implication future obesity treatment strategy .</brief_summary>
