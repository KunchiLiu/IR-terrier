	<brief_summary>The main objective evaluate strength duration immune response influenza vaccination patient Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) receive treatment biological agent compare group healthy control RA . Influenza vaccine titer draw 3 time : Baseline ( prior vaccination ) , 4-6 week post vaccination , 5-6 month post vaccination . Influenza vaccination do baseline visit baseline blood draw .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims : - Evaluate strength duration immune response influenza vaccination patient Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) receive treatment biological agent . - Evaluate predictor immune response age , gender , disease duration , type biological agent ( ) use , duration treatment , type treatment past . - Assess efficacy vaccine response population record proportion patient contract influenza illness despite vaccination . The result study may provide information regard situation inadequate immune response strength duration would likely expect . This may help lay groundwork future study look use booster vaccination population</detailed_description>
