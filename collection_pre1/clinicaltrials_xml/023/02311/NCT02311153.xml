	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Laryngeal Mask Airways Sinonasal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LMA 's studied wide range otolaryngologic procedure , generally safe accept anesthesia provider surgeon alike , safe mode airway management deliver general anesthesia . In sinonasal surgery , however , concern regard use LMA 's airway management . Due nature sinonasal procedure , patient expose blood secretion may drip/flow nasal cavity oropharynx potentially upper low airway protect adequately . Additionally , often time , manipulation patient 's head throughout procedure encounter improve operative positioning . As result , surgeon anesthesiologist hesitant utilize LMA 's type surgeries despite documented benefit increase patient comfort , few hemodynamic fluctuation induction anesthesia , good control emergence use LMA 's . Specific Aims The overall purpose study demonstrate ability provide safe effective ventilation airway protection laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) sinonasal surgery , directly compare endotracheal intubation prospective randomize single‐blind study . Aim 1 : Analyze compare incidence severity airway contamination/aspiration blood secretion sinonasal surgery reveal statistically significant difference LMA endotracheal intubation . Aim 2 : Analyze compare incidence various outcome measure include laryngospasm , bronchospasm , anesthesia time , recovery time , post‐op pain medication requirement , airway complication LMA endotracheal intubation . Aim 3 : Analyze compare patient comfort surgeon satisfaction procedure LMA endotracheal intubation group .</detailed_description>
