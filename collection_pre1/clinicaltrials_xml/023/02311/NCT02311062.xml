	<brief_summary>This investigation aim examine effect two different exercise-oriented protocol knee torque-angle relationship knee flexor . Thirty two young soccer player randomly assign three group : hamstring-eccentric ( ECC , n=11 ) , unstable-squatting ( UNS , n=11 ) control ( C , n=10 ) . The ECC UNS group perform eighteen session 6 week injury prevention protocol , use 3 hamstring-eccentric unstable-squatting exercise . The angle-torque relationship measure training intervention . Voluntary isometric torque record six test angle , participant prone ( 35ยบ-100ยบ ; 0ยบ full extension ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study utilize three parallel-groups randomize controlled design , 3 between-participant condition , ECC , UNS C , test . Once consider eligible study , participant familiarize test procedure . Participants attend laboratory pre-training test session , body mass , height muscle functional parameter record . Two day pre-test , participant include ECC UNS start 6 week ( 18 session ) train program control group perform type resistance training . Nevertheless , 6 week intervention period three group continue normal recreationally physical activity consist 2 3 session per week soccer train friendly match . Two day end intervention period muscle function re-tested .</detailed_description>
