	<detailed_description>About 50 75 % men LUTS secondary BPH also overactive bladder symptom . As major drug treatment overactive bladder symptom , muscarinic receptor antagonist use , precaution take specialist use muscarinic receptor antagonist due possibility dry mouth , constipation , blur vision post-dose dysuria acute ischuria . Mirabegron selective β3-adrenoceptor agonist relax detrusor smooth muscle increase functional bladder capacity improve overactive bladder symptom . This study examine efficacy safety mirabegron , new drug , improvement urinary frequency . The efficacy mirabegron compare placebo demonstrated phase III study , analysis patient Korea obtain significant difference placebo . The prevalence overactive bladder 9.7 % men 11.6 % woman , show similar rate 1 ) , cure rate high men woman ( OR 1.891 , CI 1.362 , 2.2627 , p=0.0001 ) . Male patient important customer OAB market low-dose anticholinergic agent relatively low risk urinary retention prefer treatment male overactive bladder ( OAB ) Korea . We conduct clinical study think mirabegron alternative therapy male OAB patient risk urinary retention .</detailed_description>
