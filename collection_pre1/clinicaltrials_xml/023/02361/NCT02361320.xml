	<brief_title>Imaging Biomarkers Pancreatic Hepatobiliary Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If agree take part study , 2 CT scan part regular cancer care review biomarkers . Biomarkers see CT image may relate status disease . One ( 1 ) scan perform start chemotherapy , first restaging visit oncologist . You also ask complete 1 questionnaire , MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Gastrointestinal cancer ( MDASI-GI ) , check health status . This questionnaire take 10 minute complete . This may do within one week schedule visit , person telephone . The study staff also collect information medical record . Length Study : Your active participation study last CT scan . Follow-Up : After last CT scan , follow-up visit and/or call . During visit and/or call , ask complete 1 questionnaire , MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Gastrointestinal cancer ( MDASI-GI ) , check health status . This questionnaire take 10 minute complete . If plan clinic visit MD Anderson chemotherapy part regular cancer care , member study staff meet briefly visit check health status . If coming MD Anderson follow-up care , member study staff call every 3-4 month see . These call last 10 minute . This investigational study . The CT scan perform use FDA-approved commercially available method . Up 259 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
