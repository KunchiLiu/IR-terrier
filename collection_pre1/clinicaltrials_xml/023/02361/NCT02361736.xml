	<detailed_description>Hydroxyethyl starch ( HES ) widely use volume expander maintain circulation patient surgery , trauma , critical disease , rapid sustain volume expansion goal . However , acute kidney injury ( AKI ) sometimes complication patient HES might contribute factor . Acute kidney injury often diagnose use sudden rise plasma creatinine ( p-crea ) abrupt decrease urine output . P-crea depend sex , nutrition , medication , muscle mass , age increase 24 48 h renal injury , diagnosis AKI delay use p-crea alone indicator renal damage . New technology allow early diagnosis AKI use measurement biomarkers urine . Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) small protein , filter via glomerulus reabsorb proximal tubule , thus low concentration NGAL measure blood urine . Approximately 6 h renal injury , NGAL increase rapidly due up-regulated expression secretion epithelial cell thick ascend limb Henle 's loop , distal tubule , collect duct . Thus , NGAL use marker renal damage . However , infection malignancy give falsely increase level . Interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) mainly create proximal kidney tubule proinflammatory factor detect early urine AKI animal model . There significant rise IL-18 level urine AKI confirm case ( chronic kidney disease , urinary tract infection , prerenal factor ) , specificity susceptibility 90 % . As result , IL-18 select biomarker . Intravenously administrated HES excrete urine also partly accumulate tissue . Studies animal human show HES molecule accumulate proximal tubule cell subsequent vacuolization swelling—a condition know osmotic nephrosis . However , recent study , primarily conduct patient sepsis , find impair renal function even use tetrastarch . In contrast , perioperative study find evidence AKI infusion HES . The investigator hypothesize 6 % HES 130/0.4 nephrotoxic effect , could reveal measurement urinary plasma NGAL IL-18 ; 6 % HES 130/0.4 influence kidney function differently crystalloids ( lactate Ringer 's solution ) due different pharmacokinetic property colloid compare crystalloids .</detailed_description>
