	<brief_title>Does Intraoperative Clonidine Reduce Post Operative Agitation Children ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Clonidine widely use off-label child several indication treatment and/or prevention postoperative agitation anaesthetise Sevoflurane . However , current level evidence support Clonidine treatment postoperative agitation child remain limited . In addition , pharmacokinetic profile intravenous Clonidine child well characterize age-groups . METHODS/DESIGN : In prospective multicentre double-blinded randomized clinical trial , investigator aim investigate impact intravenous ( IV ) Clonidine administer end surgery , incidence degree postoperative agitation . Children assign either intervention placebo group . The allocation carry centrally stratify base age trial-site , with152 patient allocate group . In intervention group , 3 microgram per kg IV clonidine administer approximately 20 minute expect completion surgery ( assess surgeon ) . In control group ; Saline ( placebo ) inject equal quantity surgery time . The drug conceal identical blind ampoule . The primary outcome postoperative agitation measure Watcha scale . Secondary outcome include measurement postoperative pain relief adverse effect , include 30-day follow-up . Twenty patient age 1-2 year twenty age &gt; 2 year , peripheral venous access place , allocate drug assay sampling ; enable compartmental PK analysis base age group , use non-linear mixed effect model .</detailed_description>
