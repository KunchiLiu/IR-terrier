	<brief_summary>Accumulating evidence suggest proliferative , invasive , immune tolerance mechanism malignant tumor use establish nutrient supply evade edit host immune response similar use develop placenta normal pregnancy . In addition share capacity invade normal tissue , cancer cell cell develop placenta create microenvironment supportive immunologic privilege angiogenesis . CD11b+Gr1+ cell heterogeneous population bone marrow-derived cell ( BMDC ) consist immature myeloid cell ( IMCs ) , first describe myeloid-derived suppressor cell . In healthy individual , IMCs generate bone marrow differentiate mature granulocyte , macrophage , dendritic cell ( DCs ) . These cell show play essential role mediate immune suppression animal model human tumor . As result tumor-induced alteration myelopoiesis , IMCs find peripheral blood , lymphoid organ tumor tissue . An increased population IMCs identify patient several tumor type . Accordingly , IMCs detect peripheral blood patient bear express common myeloid marker CD33 lack marker mature myeloid cell MHC class II molecule HLADR . IMCs show actively promote tumor growth metastasis modulate cytokine environment , vascular remodel promote angiogenesis . It demonstrate laboratory IMCs infiltrate placenta pregnant mouse actively promote angiogenesis . These cell show striking similarity IMCs populate malignant tumor . Accordingly , human placenta also infiltrate significant population IMCs . Immunostaining human placenta show IMCs comprise around 25 % ( range 10-40 % ) total placental CD45+ bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cell population locate close blood capillary . The investigator also demonstrate immature DCs , cell originally describe regulate adaptive immune response , also promote angiogenesis model choroidal neovascularization , endometriosis tumor . Tho objective propose study compare abundance IMC , DC , monocytes neutrophils count blood sample normal pregnancy : 1. woman term active labor . 2 . In woman labor . 3 . In pre term labor . According previous finding , investigator hypothesize IMC 's , monocytes active delivery ( term pre term ) low woman without sign labor . The investigator also hypothesize DC 's neutrophil abundant active delivery ( term pre term ) woman without sign labor . Experimental plan : Blood count collect pregnant woman agree participate research : The sample send routine complete blood count Hillel Yaffe hematologic lab also analyze IMC 's DC 's population lab use fluorescent immunostaining specific monoclonal antibody flow cytometry . IMC 's per total CD45 positive hematopoietic cell placental tissue analyze use fluorescent immunostaining specific monoclonal antibody flow cytometry . The specific location cell placenta identify within placental tissue use Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . The expression pro angiogenic gene analyze RT PCR Western blotting .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Women active labor normal pregnancy term . Women , normal pregnancy term come usual follow without sign labor ( contraction / `` show '' discharge/ rupture membrane ) . Women active pre term labor ( 34 37w ) normal pregnancy . Unwilling woman participate research Signs infection ( fever &gt; 38 ) Women preterm birth 34 week . Administration Celeston 2 week prior enrollment . Any complication woman fetus require induction labor ( Preeclampsia , Gestational Diabetes Mellitus A2 , pre gestational diabetes , Intrauterine Growth Restriction ) .</criteria>
