	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot study investigate use deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) substantia nigra par reticulata ( SNr ) subject treatment-resistant schizophrenia . There subset patient schizophrenia continue persistent psychotic symptom ( auditory hallucination delusion ) despite multiple adequate medication trial antipsychotic medication include clozapine . There currently available treatment patient generally poor function chronically disable , unable work , live independently meaningful social relationship . Neuroimaging study patient schizophrenia reveal information pathological neural circuit could suitable target use deep brain stimulation . Although yet test patient schizophrenia , DBS early phase clinical trial psychiatric disorder . This pilot study investigate use DBS treatment-resistant schizophrenia subject exhaust therapeutic alternative continue persistent disable psychotic symptom . Of note , DBS FDA approve use patient schizophrenia . The method similar use subthalamic nucleus stimulation patient Parkinson 's Disease . However , electrode advance slightly inferior SNr , major outflow nucleus basal ganglion , intention cause local inhibition SNr outflow result disinhibition mediodorsal nucleus thalamus ( MD ) . Hypofunction MDN implicate pathophysiology schizophrenia post-mortem well multiple structural functional imaging study . Evidence suggest dysfunction MD implicate positive cognitive symptom ( work memory impairment ) schizophrenia . Frequent monitor clinical assessment psychiatric scale use monitor treatment response .</brief_summary>
