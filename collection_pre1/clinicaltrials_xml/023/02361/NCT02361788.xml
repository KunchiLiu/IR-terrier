	<brief_summary>Background : Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia common reason admission neonatal period ( first month life ) worldwide SMRU . The skin newborn baby becomes jaundice , cause high level bilirubin blood . In neonate level bilirubin increase level cause braindamage even death . There different cause know lead high level bilirubin , example G6PD deficiency prematurity . In case neonatal hyperbilirubinemia neonate need treat phototherapy ( blue light therapy ) . If prolonged jaundice ( ≥ 21 day ) , investigation need do . Objectives : Primary objective : To determine etiology neonatal hyperbilirubinemia neonates gestational age ≥ 28 week refugee migrant population , Thai-Myanmar border . Secondary objective : - Establishing incidence neonatal hyperbilirubinemia - Determine risk factor development neonatal hyperbilirubinemia - Determine incidence prolong neonatal jaundice - Determine neurodevelopmental outcome , age 6 12 month - Determine body composition , use air-displacement plethysmography , birth , 1 , 2 3 month age - Determine incidence anaemia illness episode first year life - Determine incidence helminthic infection age one year - Assess knowledge level misbeliefs neonatal hyperbilirubinemia among mother SMRU health care staff Research design : The study conduct exhaustive prospective descriptive study , eligible newborn enrol obtain informed consent mother . During pregnancy delivery collect clinical data mother . At birth take umbilical cord blood ( 9 ml ) test different cause neonatal hyperbilirubinemia . In first week life plan 4 moment measure bilirubin hematocrit level ( 0.05 ml ) , weight ask question feed practice . Based bilirubin result determine whether neonate need phototherapy . After first week weekly follow-up conducted case visible jaundice measure bilirubin level . If neonate still jaundice age 21 day investigate cause . In infant period , age one year , plan monthly follow-up ass health growth child age 3 , 6 12 month neurodevelopmental test . An improved understanding pathological process contribute development neonatal hyperbilirubinemia need order identify neonate risk develop improved management .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PROCEDURES DURING PREGNANCY During first antenatal care visit mother gestational dating ultrasound determine accurate gestational age . During antenatal care visit information mother collect part standard obstetric care : - Ethnicity - Age - Medical history - Blood transfusion history - Chronic disease - Obstetric history - Parity gravida - Previous neonatal death reason death - Previous preterm delivery - Previous child neonatal hyperbilirubinemia - Pregnancy - Gestational date ultrasound - Obstetric problem - Malaria morbidity episodes pregnancy - BMI , MUAC weightgain - Laboratory result - Hepatitis B status* - HIV status* - Syphilis serology* - G6PD status - Hemoglobinopathy - ABO blood group - Rhesus D blood group Testing STD HIV routine practice SMRU clinic . Before screen permission mother request . Life-long antiretroviral triple therapy available case positive HIV test . To assess knowledge belief neonatal jaundice among mother perform short questionnaire . This questionnaire help study team ass level knowledge misbeliefs neonatal hyperbilirubinemia . The study team also ask subject use naphthalene contain moth ball explain danger case subject 's baby G6PD deficient . PROCEDURES AT BIRTH Eligibility : At birth neonate exclude gestational age &lt; 28 week . Questionnaire : Detailed data delivery collect : - Duration maternal membrane rupture delivery - Mode delivery - Presence maternal fever labour use antibiotic - Use oxytocin - Complications - Gestational age - Confirmed ultrasound present &lt; 24 week ( CRL &lt; 14 week , HC 14-23+6 ) , case late ultrasound , determine Dubowitz gestational age assessment ( perform 6-72 hour birth ) - Apgar score need resuscitation - Gender Laboratory Investigations : Umbilical cord blood obtain laboratory investigation ; ABO Rhesus D blood group 0.1 ml. , G6PD fluorescent test 0.005 ml. , G6PD spectrophotometric assay 0.05 ml. , G6PD flow cytometric assay 0.05 ml. , Coomb 's test ( Direct Antiglobulin Test ) 3 ml. , Albumin 3 ml. , Genotyping ( G6PD , SAO , UGT1A1 mutation ) 2 ml. , Total volume 8.205 ml ( For practical reason take 9 ml . ) Clinical assessment : Birthweight , length head circumference determine . The body composition measure use air-displacement plethysmography ( PeaPod ) . A newborn physical examination ( include vital sign ) perform within first 24 hour , part normal neonatal care : Observations : - skin colour ( pale/cyanosed/jaundiced/normal ) , - skin rash - description anterior fontanelle ( raised/normal/depressed ) , - bruising body : location - swell head - 2 diameter measure - swell cross scalp suture - diagnose : caput succedaneum , cephalhematoma subgaleal hemorrhage - abnormality face - abnormality palate , mouth - abnormality limb , finger toe Cardiovascular examination : heart rate ( per minute ) , heart sound , femoral pulse Respiratory examination : respiratory rate ( per minute ) , lung sound , sign respiratory distress ( chest indrawing/nasal flaring/head bobbing ) Abdominal examination : abdominal mass , enlarge liver spleen , genitalia , anus Neurological examination : muscle tone , move limb , eye red reflex PROCEDURES DURING NEONATAL FOLLOW-UP In first week birth four moment neonate assess . This 24 hour [ range 22-26 hour ] , 48 hour [ range 36-60 hour ] , 84 hour [ range 70-96 hour ] day 6 [ range day 5-8 ] . After week mother ask come back weekly follow-up age one month . At one month age body composition measure use PeaPod . Questionnaire : The mother ask question : First 24 hour delivery : - Age ( hour ) initiation feed - Feeding : - How baby fed ( exclusive breastmilk , supplementary mixed feeding ) - If supplementary feeding , reason ? - Does baby suck well ? - Use drug herbal medicine mother first 24 hour - Use herbal preparation neonate - Age ( hour ) passage first stool urine - Use napthalene ball store baby clothes During every follow-up mother question feed repeat . Laboratory Investigations : During every neonatal follow-up visit day 6 [ range day 5-8 ] , SBR haematocrit measure . The SBR result plot , age jaundice treatment graph specific gestational age need phototherapy intense follow-up determine . During weekly follow-up age 8 day , SBR hematocrit measure case visible jaundice . At age one month , hematocrit measure anemia screen G6PD fluorescent test repeat . Serum bilirubin 0.05 ml . x 5 , Haematocrit 0.05 ml . x 5 , G6PD fluorescent test 0.005 ml . Total 0.205 ml . Clinical assessment : A physical examination ( include vital sign ) perform every visit weight measure . Weightloss -increase calculate ≥ 10 % weightloss , neonate review carefully underlie cause weightloss supplementary feeding ( express breastmilk powdermilk ) start . PROCEDURES WHEN DELIVERY OUTSIDE SMRU In case delivery another clinic home , mother neonate visit SMRU clinic within first 48 hour delivery , neonate still include study . If neonate bear outside SMRU visit clinic within 48 hour delivery , present neonatal hyperbilirubinemia first 8 day life , neonate include study well . Because umbilical cord blood take , limited set laboratory investigation perform , describe ; . ABO Rhesus D bloodgroup 0.075 ml. , G6PD fluorescent test 0.005 ml. , G6PD spectrophotometric assay 0.05 ml. , G6PD flow cytometric assay 0.05 ml. , Serum bilirubin 0.05 ml. , Haematocrit 0.05 ml. , Genotyping 2 ml. , Total volume 2.23 ml . PROCEDURES DURING INFANT FOLLOW-UP Infant follow-up take place every month age 12 month . Questionnaire : At every visit mother ask feeding practice age 6 month neurodevelopmental milestone . Laboratory investigation : Due problem anaemia population ( 50 % infant report haematocrit &lt; 33 % age 6 month ; personal communication Dr. Rose McGready ) haematocrit measure monthly , finger prick , anaemia treat necessary . At age one year stool test parasitology screen take infant treat necessary . Finally one year age infant screen hemoglobinopathy due contradictory report association neonatal hyperbilirubinemia hemoglobinopathy : Haematocrit 0.05 ml . x11 , Hemoglobin type 3 ml . Total volume 3.55 ml . Clinical assessment : A physical examination ( include vital sign ) perform every visit weight measure . At age 2 3 month body composition measure use PeaPod . At 3 , 6 , 9 12 month length head circumference measure . At age 3 , 6 month 12 month infant assess Shoklo Developmental Test 53 result compare age specific norm develop population .</detailed_description>
