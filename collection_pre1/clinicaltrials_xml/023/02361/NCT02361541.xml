	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C ( HCV ) important global public health problem , disproportionally affect HIV positive population . Asia Africa account co-infection burden , access HCV screening treatment still limit . The high cost complexity current diagnostic treatment algorithm major bottleneck link lack accurate HCV prevalence estimate treatment-need data allow robust treatment advocacy program planning . Cambodia exception . It expect though , recent therapeutic advance increase global advocacy effort , HCV treatment become feasible option near future . Sihanouk Hospital Center HOPE ( Phnom Penh , Cambodia ) cater one large HIV cohort country , plan engage HCV treatment 2014 2015 onwards , double objective direct patient benefit catalyst role national level , past start antiretroviral ( ARV ) program . Within specific setting , researcher plan determine prevalence HCV co-infection , HCV genotype diversity severity liver disease HIV patient cohort , follow ambulatory setting . The researcher also explore performance simple blood tests/panels predictor significant fibrosis and/or cirrhosis . The current HCV diagnostic procedure ( tool ) , apply study , expensive resource-demanding allow scalability resource limit setting . Thus , researcher plan set study biobank sample clinically well describe HIV patient population . These sample allow constitute well-balanced panel evaluation future 'more scalable ' HCV diagnostic tool . Patients attend two study-visits . All adult patient HIV cohort propose HCV test next regular HIV follow-up consultation . HCV test follow late algorithm Centre Disease Control ( CDC ) ( May 2013 ) . During consultation , anamnesis clinical examination focus , additionally routine practice , presence general HCV liver-disease related feature . Laboratory analysis also include basic HIV ( CD4 ) , test liver function Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HbsAg ) . During follow routine HIV follow-up consultation ( 2-3 month later ) , result HCV test explain patient . If patient HCV negative , his/her study participation end . If currently infect Hepatitis C , clinician repeat HCV liver-disease ( extra-hepatic &amp; hepatic ) relate anamnesis clinical examination prescribe additional blood test non-invasive liver fibrosis/cirrhosis blood panel test , liver kidney function . Patients moreover ask undergo liver ultrasound liver stiffness measurement . The biobank set leave biological sample ( whole blood plasma serum ) comprehensive clinical information patient give additional consent scope . Both biological sample clinical information cod , ensure confidentiality .</detailed_description>
