	<detailed_description>Organ transplant recipient long-term drug-induced immunosuppression increase life-time incidence squamous cell carcinoma also affect early age general population . In organ transplant recipient prognosis squamous cell carcinoma differs due rapid growth , less differentiation high risk metastasis comparison general population . Epidemiological data indicate risk skin neoplasm organ transplant recipient related cumulative exposure immunosuppressive drug time . It remain unclear wether risk differs drug class . This study prospective observational cohort study kidney , heart , lung , liver , pancreas small bowel transplant recipient enrol Swiss Transplant Cohort Study ( STCS ) . Since 2008 almost organ transplant recipient Switzerland enrol STCS . The STCS collect - baseline patient case data : date transplantation , age , gender , type transplant organ , past immunosuppression - follow-up patient case data : organ rejection type date rejection , type immunosuppression response organ rejection , graft loss date graft loss , immunosuppressive drug treatment , drug treatment , death , drop , occurrence cancer infection ) - drug exposure data ( start stop date ) : induction immunosuppressive drug ( Basiliximab , Rituximab , Thymoglobulin , ATG , ATGAM , IG iv , Plasmapheresis ) , maintenance immunosuppressive drug ( Cyclosporine A , Glucocorticoids , Tacrolimus , Mycophenolate mofetil , Everolimus , Azathioprine , Sirolimus , EC-MPA ) , infectious disease prophylaxis ( e.g . TM-Sulfamethoxazole , Valaciclovir , Fluconazole , Atovaquone , Voriconazole , Quinolone ) , drug ( e.g . Statins , beta-Blockers , oral antidiabetic ) . The investigator statistically illustrate incidence , prevalence type skin neoplasms STCS . The investigator show association incidence skin neoplasms exposure different immunosuppressive drug , drug parameter STCS ( e.g . age , gender ) .</detailed_description>
