	<brief_summary>Spina Bifida developmental congenital disorder cause incomplete closing embryonic neural tube , lead serious malformation nervous system . Caudal neuropore malformation almost always lead sensory-motor deficit ( include complete paraplegia ) orthopedic deformation , pressure sore , pelvic/perineal neurological dysfunction ( affect bladder-sphincter , anorectal , genital sphere ) . The purpose study assess efficacy retrograde colonic irrigation associate usual care ( medical treatment , patient education ) anorectal dysfunction ( incontinence and/or constipation ) , compare usual care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retrograde Colonic Irrigation Manage Spina Bifida Functional Digestive Sequelae : Multicenter , Prospective , Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sphincter dysfunction impair quality life patient ' self-esteem . However , defecation disorder important issue Spina Bifida National Reference Center deal . Indeed , half patient concerned . These disorder mainly due fecal stasis . Treatments include laxative hygiene recommendation . Colonic irrigation also useful , especially achieve colonic vacuity improve continence . The use intra-rectal balloon inflation probe control instillation flow improve retrograde colonic irrigation efficacy . Nevertheless , technique currently evaluate young adult suffer Spina Bifida functional digestive sequela , mainly concern Malone enema . The purpose study assess efficacy retrograde colonic irrigation associate usual care ( medical treatment , patient education ) anorectal dysfunction ( incontinence and/or constipation ) , compare usual care .</detailed_description>
