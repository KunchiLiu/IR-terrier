	<detailed_description>Rationale study conduct : Leiomyomas common benign neoplasm woman ; estimate tumor occur least 25 % woman , probably underestimation , figure base select population . They histologically compose smooth muscle cell bland , uniform , cigar-shaped nucleus arrange interlace bundle , show little mitotic activity . Cellular leiomyoma ( CLs ) describe leiomyomas significantly cellular surround myometrium , often crowd overlap nucleus . The presenting symptom differ patient typical leiomyoma . On gross examination , CLs often soft appear tan yellow less circumscribed usual leiomyoma . Pre-operatively , anyway , CLs recognize ultrasound evaluation appear hypoechoic uterine lesion . It demonstrate patient hypoechoic myoma significantly longer surgery time treatment GnRH analog rest pretreated fibroid untreated patient hypoechoic myoma . Considering predominant relevance traction maneuver laparoscopic myomectomy , difficulty adequately grasp tumor key element longer operative time . The great soften fibroid tissue probably relate degenerative change induce GnRH-analog pretreatment , particularly fibroid without adequate fibrous `` skeleton '' thus appearance hypoechoic admission ultrasonography . From pathologic point view , fibroid , pretreated , show predominance area coagulative necrosis mixoid degeneration , cause longer operative time show unequivocally negative effect preoperative GnRH analog treatment kind uterine fibroid . At time , hypoechoic CLs responsive ulipristal acetate treatment common leiomyoma , give antiproliferative activity culture leiomyoma cell . The antiproliferative ulipristal effect , moreover , induces condition apoptotic necrosis , compare GnRH-a myxoid necrosis , probably allow easy surgical enucleation tumor .</detailed_description>
