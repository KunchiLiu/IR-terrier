	<brief_title>The Effect Ulipristal Acetate ( UPA ) Women Ovarian Reserve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The uterine leiomyoma common benign tumor female genital tract . The myoma usually clinically apparent 25 % patient . Among late possible therapeutic option , UPA prove effective medical management fibroid . Its advent clinical practice probably modify surgical approach , since UPA could possible place preoperative adjunct surgery also medical therapy avoid surgery . Very recently , result first study long-term intermittent ( 18 month ) therapy 10-mg UPA publish , demonstrate regimen ( four course 3 month ) maximize effect UPA induce high rate amenorrhea reduce fibroid size . Long term treatment , however , call question safety issue need explore . In patient treated UPA , Estradiol 5-mg 10-mg dos remain midfollicular level first course therapy , avoid menopausal symptom , frequently observe gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH- ) agonist group . No data publish Estradiol level end second , third fourth course UPA . Moreover , data publish effect UPA FSH AMH level ovarian antral follicle count ( AFC ) vascularization index treatment . Considering young woman reproductive age ( 40 year old ) , desire pregnancy , UPA propose avoid postpone surgery , also long-term administration program , data effect woman ovarian reserve urgently need . For reason , data biochemical ( AMH , FSH E2 ) 3D ultrasonographic ( VI , FI , AFC ) parameter woman treat UP need assess effect drug term ovarian reserve modification .</detailed_description>
