The maximum dose single course MT-3724 give intravenous ( IV ) infusion Days 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 12 negligible side effect and/or maximum serum level and/or maximum effect blood lymphocytes observe . Four dose level investigate . 2 . The change MT-3724 serum level blood lymphocyte time follow IV dos different point study . 3 . The change kinds clinical laboratory effect side effect may occur repeated course MT-3724 4 . The change subject 's immune status non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma follow one cycle 6 infusion .</detailed_description>
