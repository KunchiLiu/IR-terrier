	<brief_summary>It common understanding patient coronary heart disease suffering , among others , reduce myocardial perfusion . In order increase ( normalize ) reduce perfusion , conventional approach fail , coronary bypass surgery , coronary vessel dilatation/stenting perform . The similar situation reduce myocardial perfusion may find patient stenosis aortic valve , aortic valve replacement may increase myocardial perfusion left-ventricular remodelling . However , presently method establish measure myocardial perfusion quantitatively noninvasively therapeutic intervention . Data pre- post-therapeutic myocardial perfusion , quantitatively measure ml/100g/min would strengthen indication specific therapeutic approach enable objective control effectiveness apply therapy . Hypothesis : There measureable difference quantitative myocardial perfusion value ( low ) ( high ) interventional surgical procedure . The goal study measure myocardial perfusion advance CT technology ( e.g . iCT 256 Brilliance ) quantitatively ml/100g/min three group patient : 1 . Before coronary bypass surgery 2 . Before coronary vessel dilatation/stenting 3 . Before aortic valve replacement . The investigator assign specific intervention subject three group . Therefore , research strictly observational . Design : Prospective study measure quantitatively myocardial perfusion mention three group patient simultaneous control registration essential , physiological determinant myocardial perfusion immediately prior CT study . The CT myocardial perfusion measurement perform directly indication intervention surgery last day discharge hospital . All collect data ( determinant ) inclusively CT-studies anonymised archived local server . The investigator University Medical Computed Sciences Technology , Innsbruck / Austria perform evaluation myocardial perfusion measurement statistical analysis independently CT-studies perform physician .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Reliability hypothesis : On phantom study simulate myocardial perfusion measurement animal study could confirm use advanced CT technology ( e.g . `` iCT 256 Brilliance '' ) possible measure myocardial perfusion absolute value - ml/100g/min . These myocardial perfusion measurement differ receive EBCT ( Electron Beam Computed Tomography ) Based experimental result base quantitative measurement myocardial perfusion 1500 patient study EBCT Medical University Graz hypothesis may do use mention iCT 256 technology , possible measure myocardial perfusion quantitatively daily clinical practice . Ethical aspect : The study perform accord international regulation ( ISO 14144:212-01 ) agreement `` Declaration Helsinki '' . After oral write explanation plan study sign study agreement patient responsible physician , patient participation voluntary . The patient participate leave study time without negative sequel . There financial restitution patient . Patients informed ( rare ) possible allergoid-toxic reaction intravenous contrast agent application . For possible emergency well trained medical staff equipment present . About renal insufficiency : renal failure ( creatinin clearance &lt; 60ml/min [ GFR ( Glomerulo Filtration Rate ) calculate accord Cockroft-Gault-Formula , GFR { ml/min } = ( ( 40-age ) *weight { kg } *0,85 { woman } ] /serum creatinin [ mg/dl ] *72 ) . The applied X-ray dose ( CT ) may reduce : reduction KV ( kilovoltage ) 120 100 80 dependance patient weight , reduction MA ( milliamper ) use iterative image reconstruction allgorithm ( iDOSE ) . These technical approach represent best possibility reduce X-ray dose patient . As coronary heart disease stenotic lesion 50 % disease mainly elderly men ( female mostly menopause male 50 year age ) risk X-Ray dose relate genetic defect low . The expected applied X-Ray dos mention approach low therefore risk X-Ray induced malignancy may regard low . Design : Prospective study measure quantitatively myocardial perfusion mention three group patient simultaneous control registration essential , physiological determinant myocardial perfusion immediately CT study . The CT myocardial perfusion measurement perform directly indication intervention surgery last day discharge hospital . All collect data ( determinant ) inclusively CT-studies anonymised archived local server . These anonymised data may approach co-worker UMIT , perform evaluation myocardial perfusion measurement statistical analysis independently CT-studies perform physician . Practical procedure : 1 . In supine position CT table blood pressure heart rate measure register . 2 . In patient standard native cardiac CT evaluation coronary calcification Agatston score perform . 3 . In patient myocardial perfusion measure inspiration contrast agent application amount contrast agent apply dose related patient weight show : Patient Perfusion 210mg Iodine/ml Expected dose weight [ kg ] / [ kV/mAs ] / [ ml ] / per shoot [ mSv ] ( milli Sievert ) &lt; 60 80/80 40 0.21/ 60-70 80/100 50 0.25/ 70-90 80/120 60 0.30/ 90-100 100/90 70 0.40/ &gt; 100 100/100 80 0.43 4 . Standard cardiac CT perform evaluate coronary artery leave ventricular volume . 5 . In supine position CT table blood pressure heart rate measure register . Quantitative evaluation : The calculation myocardial perfusion succeed slice visible leave ventricular myocardium use modification formula describe K.Miles . The calculation leave ventricular volume succeed use vendor software . Statistic : All personal measure data anonymised , test , analyse evaluate Health &amp; Life Sciences University , Tryol . The numerical value express mean +/- SD ( min , max , 95 % CI ) . P-values 0.05 regard statistically significant . Paired test Wilcoxon signed-rank test use . XÂ² analysis use compare categoric variable . Additionally correlation analysis ( Pearson , Spearman ) perform method classification ( pre- vs. postoperative ) apply . All calculation do SPSS 21.0 ( SPSS , Chicago , Il , USA ) Matlab R2013b statistic Toolbox . The neccessary number study patient base result 64 patient study aortic valve replacement myocardial perfusion measure four month surgery . Pre-operative : Mean=74 ( SD=21 ) ml/100g/min Post 4 Months : Mean=78 ( SD=20 ) ml/100g/min . Difference= +4ml/100g/min . With 0.5 supposed correlation measure value standard deviation difference may estimate 20ml/100g/min . By alpha=0.05 , 1-beta=0.80 , n=209 patient need . As drop-out quote 10 % may expect neccessary study group patient 230 patient . This mean total 690 patient . All data register EXCEL-data bank test plausibility .</detailed_description>
