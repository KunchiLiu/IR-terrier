	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION The purpose present study establish Troponin I ( TI ) peripheral blood prognostic indicator emergence syndrome acute respiratory difficulty ( ARDS ) child shock . It note shock ARDS life-threatening disease one trigger another ( shock first ARDS ARDS shock ) . Both involve abnormality blood flow ( perfusion ) tissue lead cellular stress , reduction oxygen suplly ( hypoxia ) , nutrient , consenquently generate increase tissue´s metabolic demand . This set event call ischemia . The shock dynamic clinical syndrome acute complex circulatory dysfunction , cause severe illness trauma . To perpetuate generates multiple organ dysfunction death . Regardless cause , conceptualize state acute oxygen deficiency prevents cell sustainability . The shock one five leading cause admission emergency Pediatrics unit ( EPU ) Hospital Civil de Guadalajara `` Fray Antonio Alcalde '' ( HCFAA ) . Shock second cause mortality patient EPU . ARDS acute diffuse , pulmonary inflammatory lesion characterize increased pulmonary vascular permeability , weight decrease ventilation lung tissue . The specific clinical element hypoxemia bilateral radiographic opacity associate increase mixture venous blood , physiological dead space reduction pulmonary compliance . Diffuse alveolar damage morphological element acute phase ( e.g . swell , inflammation , hyaline membrane bleeding ) . It mortality rate 30-50 % world . TI protein determine blood pathological condition ; mainly increase myocardial ischemia . It use first instance diagnose acute coronary syndrome ischemia , coronary angina pectoris acute myocardial infarction . It document increase TI patient critical condition without coronary disease , mainly individual sepsis , septic shock , hypovolemic shock child respiratory failure respiratory syncytial virus ; addition , interpret prognostic marker mortality . TI seem anticipate clinical sign event persistent hypoxia may lead ischemia . The elevation serum level TI indicate myocardial damage , explain underlying mechanism . The addition ARDS shock generates trouble circumstance . However , child presentig shock develop ARDS ; necessary predict ARDS diagnose early stage ; This impact implementation strategy avoid severe form disease . With foundation investigator propose use TI prognostic indicator ARDS child shock . To validate hypothesis conduct study dynamic prospective cohort , type diagnostic test . The exposed cohort represent child shock take TI increase follow-up ; patient analyze ARDS ( event ) present TI high ( exhibition ) develop ARDS normal TI . Determine sample peripheral blood first 24 hour , take infant present shock without ARDS join EPU sign consent parent accept participation child study . The quantitative result sample obtain ELISA test sandwich immunofluorescence , carry Emergency Robotic laboratory Robotics HCFAA . The investigator monitor patient daily 7 day ; data obtain documented blog purpose . The investigator determine exposure increase TI serum value equal great 0 . 05ng/ml . The investigator believe development ARDS event . The diagnosis ARDS establish child meet criterion specify definition Berlin ARDS 2012 , within seven day onset shock . The statistical analysis plan consist case whole , establish initial comparability group , estimate magnitude effect partnership finally , investigator make adjustment potential confounding factor . The investigator begin descriptive statistic apply Shapiro ( small sample ) test determine normality distribution variable define type statistical analysis follow ( parametric free distribution ) . Test Chi2 allow comparison proportion risk qualitative variable . Will use R Pearson Spearman Rho test establish correlation quantitative variable . Test Student 's T Mann-Whitney ( accord find data distribution ) U use comparison independent medium . The investigator consider significant value p &lt; 0.05.The estimate magnitude effect carry determination relative risk ( RR ) absolute risk reduction ( ARR ) . The primary clinical research study represent cross-sectional study , case control , cohort clinical trial . TI diagnostic test , calculate sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , probability index elaborate COR ( Receiver Operating Characteristic ) curve optimum cut TI ( quantitative variable express ng/ml ) determine approach sensitivity specificity . QUESTION OF RESEARCH Does increase Troponin I serum child shock Emergency Room predict ARDS ? General Objective . Establish increase TI value predictor ARDS child shock . Specific objective . 1 . To determine incidence child shock develops ARDS . 2 . Establish correlation TI ARDS Kirby oxygenation index . 3 . To determine sensitivity specificity TI ARDS child shock . 4 . Establish serum prognostic value TI ARDS child shock The sample size Calculated sample size study prospective cohort confidence interval ( CI ) 95 % , 80 % power . Exposed non-exposed 2:1 relation . Probability occur event cohort expose 72 % 32 % unexposed . The investigator obtain 41 patient unexposed cohort 21 expose require observe difference . Total number 62 patient ( n=62 ) . The sample size calculate Epi Info version 7 Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) , Atlanta . Population Population take room Emergency Pediatric Unit ( EPU ) Hospital Civil Fray Antonio Alcalde ( HCFAA ) . Inclusion criteria 1 . Informed consent sign parent participate study . 2 . Children admit EPU HCFAA 1 month old 14 year old show shock le 24 hour evolution . 3 . Need endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation . Exclusion criteria 1 . Intake toxic tricyclic antidepressant , cocaine methamphetamine 2 . Transfusion three concentrate erythrocyte / plasma enter EPU . 3 . Pregnant girl 4 . Children previous diagnosis uremic kidney injury . Criteria elimination 1 . Parents legal guardian patient request leave study . 2 . Does gas analysis lactate time final categorization shock . Procedure The investigator include child shock , categorize instrument Pediatric assessment consist General assessment , primary , secondary tertiary assessment triangle . The doctor perform final categorization patient pediatrician pediatric resident certify American Academy Pediatrics American Heart Association Pediatric Advanced Life Support . Physicians train one hour pediatric evaluation management instrument prior participation . For purpose , instrument admission Hospital Triage sheet . The possibility categorization initial pathophysiological accord triangle General evaluation follow : 1 . Stable ( three part normal triangle ) 2 . Primary Disfunction Central Nervous System metabolic ( abnormal appearance ) 3 . Shortness breath ( abnormal breathing ) 4 . Respiratory failure ( abnormal breathing abnormal color appearance ) . 5 . Shock ( abnormal color ) 6 . Cardiorespiratory failure / imminent death ( three part abnormal triangle ) disease . Immediately categorization primary evaluation ; perform corresponding placement monitor measurement vital sign , well evaluate give A-B-C-D-E type treatment : air-permeable ( A ) , control management breath ( B ) , circulation ( C ) , identification neurological Deficit ( D ) ( E ) exhibition . Within laboratory study request tertiary evaluation , hold gas arterial blood lactate measurement . If child meet inclusion criterion , enter cohort study . One mililiter blood sample first 24 hour onset shock collect special tube contain anticoagulant specially marked purple lid manufacturer . The sample take emergency laboratory HCFAA within 10 minute obtain , process use ELISA test sandwich immunofluorescence use reagent Enzyme Immunoassay Quantitative Determination Cardiac-Specific Troponin-I Human Serum ( cTnI ) ELISA . The result report laboratory within 30 minute delivery , report cardiac Triage . The result TI express within range value less 0 . 05ng/ml high range value equal great 0 . 05ng/ml . Once obtained result , add document protocol 's log . Stroke ECG Echocardiogram perform patient , conduct MD. , Pediatrician Certified Cardiologist . The patient follow 7 day entry cohort . The investigator describe exposure cohort , TI ≥0 . 05ng/ml increase consider development ARDS , accord definition 2012 Berlin , even latter constitute measure instrument . There conflict interest . Equipment reagent determination TI obtain public tender officer Administrative Hospital Subdirector HCFAA . Dependent ( outcome ) variable : ARDS Independent ( Predictor ) variable : Troponin I</detailed_description>
