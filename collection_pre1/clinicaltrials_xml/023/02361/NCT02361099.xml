	<brief_title>SENTINEL : Impact Use Web-application Detection Lung Cancer Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With 5-year survival 15 % pulmonary cancer poor prognosis . About 70 75 % cancer diagnose advanced stage . Relapses common rarely curable . At least 75 % relapse symptomatic standard monitor curative treatment . Currently , common monitoring strategy involve completion clinical examination every 3 6 month associate chest X-ray CT-scan . An intensive clinical imaging monitoring yet show survival advantage monitoring symptom appear significant medical economic advantage compare image monitoring . This non-personalized approach source anxiety patient , especially approach date image assessment . In contrast , monitor leave symptomatic patient untreated relapse several week many symptomatic patient wait date imaging assessment consult . investigator develop score base dynamic association clinical sign alert physician possible recurrence lung cancer . The refer physician alert early convenes patient checkup . One explanation could demonstrate gain survival possibility offer application SENTINEL treat relapse earlier , thus avoid wait much important deterioration general condition two monitor follow-up le space .</detailed_description>
