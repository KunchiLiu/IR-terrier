	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Part IA : 1 . Provided write informed consent prior enrollment . 2 . Male female least 18 year age . 3 . A life expectancy least 12 week . 4 . Histologically cytologically confirm advanced metastatic solid tumor effective standard therapy available . 5 . BRCA1/2 mutation require enrichment subject population permit . 6 . Small cell lung cancer , high grade serous ovarian cancer , triple negative breast cancer subject preferentially recruit . 7 . Glioblastoma multiforme subject may eligible , discussion sponsor investigator . 8 . Archival tumor tissue strongly recommend collect available . 9 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤1 . Phase IB/Part A : 1 . Provided write informed consent prior screen visit . 2 . Male female least 18 year age day sign informed consent . 3 . Subjects histologically cytologically confirm advanced metastatic ovarian , fallopian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer , breast cancer , CRPC progress receive least one prior chemotherapy regimen advance metastatic setting could recruit L 4 . Subjects must measurable disease define per RECIST Version 1.1 , except : 1 . Subjects ovarian cancer without measurable disease may consider evaluable base GCIG CA125 criterion , discussion sponsor medical monitor . 2 . Subjects metastatic CRPC ( mCRPC ) nonmeasurable bone lesion must either progression 2 new lesion prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) progression specify PCWG2 criterion study eligibility within 6week period study drug administration . 5 . All subject must agree provide blood sample germline BRCA and/or mutation test . 6 . ECOG performance status ≤1 . 7 . A life expectancy least 12 week . Phase IB/Part B : 1 . Provided write informed consent prior screen visit . 2 . Male female least 18 year age day sign informed consent . 3 . Histologically cytologically confirm advanced metastatic solid tumor effective standard therapy available . 4 . BRCA1/2 mutation require enrichment subject population preferable . Subjects ovarian , fallopian , primary peritoneal , breast cancer CRPC must agree provide blood sample germline BRCA and/or mutation test even previously test . 5 . It highly recommend subject provide archival tumor tissue agree tumor biopsy biomarker analysis 6 . Small cell lung cancer , highgrade serous ovarian cancer , triple negative breast cancer subject preferentially recruit . 7 . Subjects must measurable disease define per RECIST Version 1.1 . Subjects ovarian cancer without measurable disease may consider evaluable base GCIG CA 125 criterion , discussion sponsor medical monitor . 8 . ECOG performance status ≤1 . 9 . A life expectancy least 12 week . 1 . Subjects treat chemotherapy , biologic therapy , immunotherapy , investigational agent within 5 t1/2 within 4 week ( whichever longer ) prior start study drug ( recovered side effect therapy ) 2 . Subjects undergone major surgery/surgical therapy cause within 4 week screen visit . subject must recover treatment stable clinical condition enter study 3 . Subjects receive radiotherapy target lesion 4 . Subjects receive local radiotherapy nontarget lesion local symptom control within last 4 week must recover adverse effect radiotherapy record baseline symptom 5 . Lesions treat locoregional therapy within last 3 month study inclusion qualify target lesion unless progression demonstrate</criteria>
