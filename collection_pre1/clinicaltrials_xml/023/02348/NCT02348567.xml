Twenty-three hospital ( 77 % ) ( 3 university hospital , 5 psychiatric hospital , 15 general hospital ) agree participate randomise one trial cluster . Eleven hospital receive announce survey ( control group ) 12 hospital receive unannounced survey ( intervention group ) .We hypothesise hospital receive unannounced survey rat less successful hospital receive announce survey , define meeting less compliance accreditation standard performance indicator . Nine experience surveyor employ educate The Danish Institute Quality Accreditation Health Care ( IKAS ) responsible conduct survey accord abbreviated version current Danish periodic survey . The outcome compliance indicator reflect organisational performance . Compliance analyse use logistic linear regression analysis random effect , contingency table , Pearson 's chi-squared test Fishers exact test , whichever appropriate . Ethics Dissemination : This trial pending ethic approval Research Ethichs Comite North Denmark Region . The finding randomise control trial disseminate peer-reviewed journal , national international conference utilise health care political decision make future national accreditation programme .

	<detailed_description>Accreditation external audit validate healthcare organisation ' operation practice satisfy agree high-quality service criterion conduct 70 country ( 1,2 ) . In 2003 , Danish government The Danish Regions ( responsible public hospital ) decide implement nationwide model quality healthcare involve formal accreditation Danish public hospital . In 2007 , national Institute Quality Accreditation Healthcare ( IKAS ) form develop The Danish Healthcare Quality Programme ( DDKM ) ; since 2010 , public hospital accredit base announce on-site survey conduct every third year ( include periodic midterm survey ) .

The DDKM base announce survey procedure pre-announcing date survey criticise create `` arrange reality '' reflect daily work quality care . This criticism unique Danish setting , raise number country operate accreditation system base upon announced survey ( 6,7 ) . Another possible negative effect announce survey considerable amount time human resource use prepare announce survey implies less time available patient care period preparation ( 6 ) . It propose unannounced accreditation survey may instrumental alleviate problem . An unannounced survey external visit pay organisation without prior notice visit take place ( 2 ) . Unannounced survey use several year The Joint Commission United States Aged Care Standards Accreditation Agency Australia , knowledge peer-reviewed literature publish experience change procedure announce unannounced survey ( 2,7,8 ) . Only one project , launch The Centre Clinical Governance Research ( CCGR ) Australia 2012 , encompass empirical test short-notice survey two accreditation programme . This study conduct paired design short-notice survey compare recent advanced notification survey . The study find use short-notice survey approach rating organisational performance less successful advanced notification survey ( 5 % significance level , P=0.044 ) ( 9 ) . The present trial design IKAS Danish Center Healthcare Improvements ( DCHI ) inform decision whether implement unannounced accreditation survey 3rd version DDKM 2016 . In September 2013 , IKAS Board Directors decide approve finance project , expect result present trial available Board 's decision 2015 . To provide best possible basis political decision-making , present study design nationwide cluster-randomised , controlled trial include general hospital , university hospital , psychiatric hospital five region Denmark . The objective trial evaluate effect unannounced hospital survey base finding survey embrace abbreviate set national accreditation standard performance indicator DDKM version 2 . We hypothesise unannounced survey produce less successful measure organisational performance announce survey . This study define less successful less compliance include standard performance indicator .</detailed_description>
