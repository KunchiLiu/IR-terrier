	<brief_summary>Adequate control extracellular volume major goal renal replacement therapy patient chronic renal disease . Fluid overload present early stage chronic kidney disease contribute significantly hypertension , arteriosclerosis high prevalence leave ventricular hypertrophy . These associate high rate morbidity mortality group patient , rate dialysis Brazil around17.9 % per year . Dry weight hemodialysis remain delicate gap hypervolemia hypovolemic . Many study show tight control post - dialysis weight relate well outcomes short term high long-term survival . Many method propose estimate hydration status hemodialysis patient objective manner , include ultrasonography inferior vena cava echocardiography . However , method time-consuming cumbersome use daily practice . In dialysis center , dry weight evaluate subjective clinical criterion , trial error time consume . It recently introduce Brazil monitor body composition multifrequency bioimpedance , call Body Composition Monitor ( BCM ) manufacture Fresenius Medical Care . The BCM piece bioimpedance spectrometry use three compartment model , able quantify objectively accurately extracellular volume hydration status patient measure body resistance electric current . The procedure safe , simple relatively inexpensive . The BCM use multi-frequency current ( range 5 1000 KHz ) . The availability device evaluation body composition assess dry weight efficiently objectively determine target achieve prevent leave ventricular hypertrophy , hypertension well manage improve cardiovascular outcome , motivates u perform study . So goal compare efficacy bioelectrical impedance analysis clinical evaluation suitability dry weight hemodialysis patient . A prospective , randomize , crossover study , include chronic renal failure patient hemodialysis St. Luke 's Hospital ( PUC - RS ) , include patient least three month HD 18 year age . The expected primary outcome achieve great accuracy determine state hydration dry weight patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Dryweight Determination Hemodialysis Patients With Two Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient study undergo period prior randomization week , data register pre post blood pressure , average weight gain ( delta weight ) session transdialysis complication . In first phase , BIA clinical evaluation ass blood volume pre-hemodialysis session state single assessment evaluate patient study . The clinical assessment method dry weight determination include : patient history search sign symptom volume overload , analysis pre treatment blood pressure , adventitious sound pulmonary auscultation among others . Patients randomize systematic manner two group : Group A - Clinic Assessment ( AC ) : patient dry weight determine clinical examination , unit routine , four week . Clinical criterion dry weight adjustment : edema , dyspnea , report shortness breath , post dialysis blood pressure great equal 140/90 mmHg . Group B - bioimpedance ( BIA ) : BIA use estimate dry weight four week , pre first HD session week . At end first four week group assess hydration state , data register specific instrument ass weight gain session , frequency complication time reach dry weight . After two week ' interval , wash , group would change method use assess dry weight . ( A - BIA B -CA ) After second phase , patient evaluation BIA assess hydration state , weight gain session , frequency complication time reach dry weight , data register specific instrument . Dry weight achieve adjustment make HD session , base clinical evaluation BIA . The maximum decrement achieve dry weight 500 gram weight per dialysis session . Nurses clinical evaluation group . The unit heath team , nurse doctor , trained methodology use research help determine dry weight .</detailed_description>
