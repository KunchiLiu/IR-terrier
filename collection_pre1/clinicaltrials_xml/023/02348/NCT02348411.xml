	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety initial effectiveness MRI-guided focus ultrasound thermal ablation designate area brain patient suffer medication-refractory MDD , use ExAblate transcranial system . The ExAblate system medical device involves focus ultrasound system MRI scanner . ExAblate delivers pulse focus ultrasound energy , sonication , target tissue . For MDD Patients : one thermal lesion create Bilateral Anterior Limb internal Capsule . The treatment begin series standard diagnostic MR image identify location shape target treat . The ExAblate computer use physician 's designation target volume plan best way cover target volume small spot call `` sonications '' . These treatment spot cylinder shape . Their size depend sonication power duration . During treatment , specific MR scan , process identify change tissue temperature , provide thermal map treatment volume confirm therapeutic effect . The thermal map use monitor treatment progress , confirm ablation proceed accord plan , thus close therapy loop . The ExAblate transcranial operate helmet-shaped transducer ( currently utilize 1000-element phased array transducer ) position subject head . The ExAblate transcranial system also include mean immobilize subject head , cool interface water , software CT analysis phase correction computation . After informed consent screening , eligible subject proceed treatment . All subject follow Day 1 , 7 day , 1 month , 6 month . At follow visit , patient evaluate general health , neurological change ( include MMSE exam ) , efficacy measurement well device/procedure related adverse event may occur follow-up period . Six ( 6 ) month follow visit also include Full Battery Cognitive/Neurological Testing</brief_summary>

Designated Ablation Targets must apparent MRI target perform direct visualization Able communicate sensation ExAblate MRgFUS treatment Depression medication regimen stable least 30 day enrollment Subjects current previous diagnosis follow psychotic bipolar disorder : Subjects primary serious ( require additional treatment ) comorbid obsessive compulsive disorder , posttraumatic stress disorder , panic disorder , bulimia , anorexia last year DSMIV Patients exhibit behavior ( ) consistent ethanol substance abuse ( aside nicotine ) define criterion outline DSMIV occur within 12 month period Active suicidal ideation plan intent self harm make suicide attempt within past 12 month Patient meet criteria personality disorder last 12 month DSMIV Patients unstable cardiac status include : Unstable angina pectoris medication Patients document myocardial infarction within six month protocol entry Congestive heart failure require medication ( diuretic ) Patients antiarrhythmic drug Severe hypertension ( diastolic BP &gt; 100 medication ) Severely impaired renal function ( estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 45ml/min/1.73 m2 ) receive dialysis Patients standard contraindication MR image nonMRI compatible implant metallic device include cardiac pacemaker , size limitation , etc . Known intolerance allergy MRI contrast agent ( e.g . Gadolinium Magnevist ) include advanced kidney disease History abnormal bleeding and/or coagulopathy Receiving anticoagulant ( e.g . warfarin ) antiplatelet ( e.g . aspirin ) therapy within one week focus ultrasound procedure drug know increase risk hemorrhage ( e.g . Avastin ) within one month focus ultrasound procedure Active suspect acute chronic uncontrolled infection History intracranial hemorrhage Cerebrovascular disease ( multiple CVA CVA within 6 month ) Individuals able willing tolerate require prolonged stationary supine position treatment ( 4 hr total table time . ) Symptoms sign increase intracranial pressue ( e.g . headache , nausea , vomit , lethargy , papilledema ) Are participate participate another clinical trial last 30 day Unable communicate investigator staff . Presence neurodegenerative disease like Parkinsonplus syndrome suspect neurological examination . These include : Multisystem atrophy Progressive supranuclear palsy Dementia Lewy body Alzheimer 's disease Anyone suspect diagnosis MDD . This include : psychotic depression , bipolar I II disorder , mental disorder due organic factor . Presence significant cognitive impairment determine score ≤ 24 Mini Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) History immunocompromise , include patient HIV positive Known lifethreatening systemic disease Patients history seizure within past year For purpose study , consider significant mood disorder include patient : receive transcranial magnetic stimulation receive electroconvulsive therapy Patients risk factor intraoperative postoperative bleeding ( platelet count le 100,000 per cubic millimeter , PT &gt; 14 , PTT &gt; 36 INR &gt; 1.3 ) document coagulopathy Patients type brain tumor , include metastasis . Any illness investigator 's opinion preclude participation study . Pregnancy lactation . Legal incapacity limit legal capacity . Patients deep brain stimulation prior stereotactic ablation Designated Ablation Target . Prior intracranial surgery Calcifications sonication pathway avoid tailor treatment plan More 30 % scalp sonication pathway cover scar , scalp disorder ( e.g. , eczema ) atrophy scalp Clips metallic implant object sonication pathway , except shunt .</criteria>
