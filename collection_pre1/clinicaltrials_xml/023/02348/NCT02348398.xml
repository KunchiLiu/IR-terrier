	<brief_title>Phase II Study Pazopanib Topotecan Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive study drug 28-day study cycle . You take pazopanib every day 28 day . You take topotecan time every day Days 1-21 , take Days 22-28 . You take pazopanib 1 hour within 2 hour eat . The pazopanib tablet swallow whole cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You chew , crush , dissolve , divide either topotecan pazopanib tablet . You give study drug diary write information take study drug time much take . You bring diary every study visit . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam . This include pelvic exam every 2 cycle . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) collect biomarker testing ( Cycles 1 2 ) , include genetic biomarkers . Biomarkers find blood/tissue may relate reaction study drug . - If become pregnant , urine pregnancy test . If take warfarin , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check blood 's ability clot . This do weekly Cycle 1 cycle change dose warfarin one study drug . On Day 1 every even-numbered cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) , CT scan MRI abdomen pelvis check status disease . You also x-ray CT scan chest check status disease need . If disease appear get good time take study drug , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . If study doctor think respond study drug , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw Day 1 Cycle 6 . If leave study , sample drawn time . End-of-Study Visit : Within 4 week last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 ½ teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You chest x-ray either CT scan MRI check status disease . If take warfarin , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check blood 's ability clot . ° If stop take study drug Cycle 6 disease get bad , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw biomarker test . Follow-Up Visits : If come study reason disease get bad , ask return clinic follow-up testing every 3 month . At visit : - You physical exam . - If study doctor think need , CT scan , MRI , x-ray check status disease . If disease get worse , call every 3 month ask . Each call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Pazopanib FDA approve commercially available treatment advance kidney cancer certain type advance soft tissue sarcoma bone , cartilage , fat , muscle . Topotecan FDA approve commercially available treatment metastatic ovarian cancer return treatment treatment small cell lung cancer return first-line treatment . Topotecan also FDA approve treat advance , recurrent persistent carcinoma cervix combination cisplatin . The use drug combination investigational . The study doctor explain drug design work . Up 40 participant enrol multicenter study . Up 30 take part MD Anderson . Up 10 enrolled Harris Health System .</detailed_description>
