	<brief_title>Bicalutamide A Treatment AR-positive Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer ( mTNBC ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) define absence estrogen progesterone receptor expression well ERBB2 amplification . It response endocrine anti-ERBB2 therapy . Recent study find potential therapeutic target TNBC . However , still poor outcome . It report TNBC six subtypes , include 2 basal-like ( BL1 BL2 ) , immunomodulatory ( IM ) , mesenchymal ( M ) , mesenchymal stem-like ( MSL ) , luminal androgen receptor ( LAR ) subtype . Different subtype may sensitive different treatment . Bicalutamide oral , non-steroidal , androgen receptor ( AR ) antagonist . It approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment metastatic prostate cancer . Recently , study explore efficacy bicalutamide AR positive , estrogen receptor negative metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) , show high clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) good safety profile . Based reason , initiate phase II study evaluate efficacy safety bicalutamide AR positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patient .</detailed_description>
