	<brief_title>Phase Ib Phase II Studies MK-3475 Combination + Renal Cell Carcinoma :</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . The phase Ib dose escalation study evaluate MK-3475 combination bevacizumab subject metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma failure least one systemic therapy metastatic disease . The phase II trial determine activity combination MK-3475 bevacizumab first line therapy subject metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma . PHASE Ib DOSE ESCALATION INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : Cohort 1 consist 3-6 patient receive MK-3475 200mg bevacizumab 5mg day 1 21-day cycle . The drug administer 15-30 minute apart separate intravenous infusion . Cohort 2 consist 3-9 patient receive MK-3475 200mg bevacizumab 10mg day 1 21-day cycle . The drug administer 15-30 minute apart separate intravenous infusion . If none 3 subject experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) first cycle therapy , additional 3 subject enrol dose level 2 . If three subject dose level 2 complete first cycle therapy without DLT , 3 subject enrolled ensure 0-1 6 subject DLT . There escalation beyond dose level 2 . PHASE II INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : The maximum safe dose MK-3475 combination bevacizumab ( determined phase 1b cohort ) give day 1 21 day cycle . Treatment continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , subject refusal , subject death either progression disease , therapy , cause . Subjects voluntarily stop study , progressive disease , unacceptable toxicity follow total 24 month . Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥ 70 % within 28 day prior registration protocol therapy . Life Expectancy : 6 month great The following baseline lab must complete within 28 day prior registration protocol therapy : Hematopoietic : - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 × 10 9/L - Platelets ≥ 100 × 10 9/L - Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 9.0 g/dL Renal : - Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) - OR , serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 × ULN , estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) ≥ 40 mL/min Hepatic : - Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN - Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 × ULN - OR , AST ALT ≤ 5 × ULN liver function abnormality due underlying malignancy Coagulation : - INR &lt; 1.5 × ULN - OR subject receive warfarin LMWH , subject must , investigator 's opinion , clinically stable evidence active bleeding receive anticoagulant therapy . The INR subject may exceed 1.5 × ULN goal anticoagulant therapy .</detailed_description>
