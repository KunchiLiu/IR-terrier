	<brief_summary>In study , 50 child 3 12 year old formally diagnose autistic spectrum disorder ( ASD ) also significant mitochondrial dysfunction treat 3 month period Mitochondrial Cocktail , combination specific nutritional supplement metabolite intermediate ( include anti-oxidants ) bio-energy substrate . A series neurological psychological evaluation conduct trained evaluators/clinicians evaluate severity clinical presentation ASD/mitochondrial dysfunction subject baseline prior treatment , 3 month treatment 6 month , another 3 month non-treatment period . In addition , laboratory investigation conduct time-points assess mitochondrial dysfunction cellular biomarkers think associate autistic mitochondrial disorder . These investigation include analysis sample blood cheek/buccal swab collect child ass select biochemical marker ASD . The Mitochondrial Cocktail treatment administer home day continuously total 3 month . All child study treat Mitochondrial Cocktail ( open label study ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , 50 child 3 12 year old formally diagnose autistic spectrum disorder ( ASD ) also significant mitochondrial dysfunction treat 3 month period Mitochondrial Cocktail , combination specific nutritional supplement metabolite intermediate ( include anti-oxidants ) bio-energy substrate . The Mitochondrial Cocktail presently widely use standard care clinically treat mitochondrial dysfunction . The precise content Mitochondrial Cocktail : - ubiquinol ( liquid form , 150 mg/kg subject weight/day - carnitine , 50 mg/kg subject weight/day - alpha-lipoic acid , 100 mg/ day . A series neurological psychological evaluation conduct trained evaluators/clinicians evaluate severity clinical presentation ASD/mitochondrial dysfunction subject baseline prior treatment , 3 month treatment 6 month , another 3 month non-treatment period . In addition , laboratory investigation conduct time-points assess mitochondrial dysfunction cellular biomarkers think associate autistic mitochondrial disorder . These investigation include analysis sample blood cheek/buccal swab collect child ass select biochemical marker ASD . The Mitochondrial Cocktail treatment administer home preferably morning day continuously total 3 month . All child study treat Mitochondrial Cocktail ( open label study ) . . Safety also evaluate base occurrence adverse event either report spontaneously subject and/or caregiver observe investigator ( ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subject/legal representative consider reliable capable adhere protocol ( e.g. , able understand complete diary ) , visit schedule , medication intake accord judgment investigator . 2 . Subject formal diagnosis autistic spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . ASD diagnosis satisfy DSM V criterion ASD , broadspectrum include severe milder case . 3 . All subject either suspected mitochondrial dysfunction assess clinical evaluation , mitochondrial dysfunction define presence significant abnormality buccal mitochondrial respiratory complex activity ( i.e. , either respiratory complex I complex IV deficiency ) significantly aberrant specific activity ratio . Subjects significant deficiency either muscle skin fibroblast respiratory activity also include case buccal mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity test perform . 1 . Subject medical psychiatric condition , opinion investigator , could jeopardize would compromise subject 's ability participate study . 2 . Subject medical condition could expect opinion investigator interfere drug absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion . 3 . Subject ketogenic specialize diet . If subject specialize diet past , must diet â‰¥2 month prior Baseline Period . 4 . Subject acute subacutely progressive central nervous system disease . 5 . Subject major brain deformation severe cognitive dysfunction . 6 . Subjects epilepsy need take antiseizure medication exclude .</criteria>
