	<brief_title>Human Lycopene Beta-cryptoxanthin Absorption From Citrus Fruit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lycopene beta-cryptoxanthin carotenoid find small number food . Unlike lycopene , beta-cryptoxanthin among 10 % carotenoid form vitamin A. Lycopene primarily find tomato tomato-based product , also pink grapefruit pink guava . Beta-cryptoxanthin primarily find tangerine , orange , pumpkin , peach , papaya . Tomatoes tomato product contain high concentration lycopene , beta-cryptoxanthin present modest amount , 2 3 mg per serving , even primary food source . Lycopene typically abundant carotenoid diet blood . Despite scarcity food , beta-cryptoxanthin third fourth abundant carotenoid blood . This suggest beta-cryptoxanthin absorption metabolism may quite different absorption metabolism lycopene carotenoid . Specifically , suggest either beta-cryptoxanthin absorbed unusually well citrus fruit primary food source beta-cryptoxanthin diet much bioavailable tomato product major source lycopene . The investigator hypothesize adult absorb significantly great amount beta-cryptoxanthin lycopene even carotenoid supply comparable amount similar matrix . Subjects give list food good source lycopene beta-cryptoxanthin ask avoid . Both carotenoid find limited number food , avoid limiting intake tomato , red orange pepper , pumpkin , watermelon , pink guava , pink grapefruit , tangerine , orange , papaya mango . The investigator fee citrus fruit volunteer randomize crossover design . On study day 14 28 , subject receive either tangerine , pink grapefruit randomize fashion subject get treatment study . Each subject serve his/her control , feed treatment different time , separate two-week washout period . On day 14 28 , subject arrive Western Human Nutrition Research Center approximately 10:30 AM . After baseline blood draw , subject feed carotenoid-containing fruit control meal ( low carotenoid , 30-35 % fat ) . Subjects give control , low carotenoid , 30-35 % kcal fat dinner 6:30 PM treatment day ( day 14 28 ) control low carotenoid , 30 - 35 % kcals fat breakfast 8 AM study day 15 29 . Investigators collect 25 mL blood per collection , venipuncture arm vein follow time point , 0 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 21 , 24hr follow fruit contain meal . Blood collect heparinized vacutainer tube place ice cover ice bucket .</detailed_description>
