	<detailed_description>This randomized trial compare two different intervention sustainable weight loss . Specifically researcher compare current best practice ( CBP ) intervention include standard dietary advice new Healthy Weight Living ( HWL ) intervention include recommendation eat diet rich protein , dietary fiber low glycemic index carbohydrate . The population adult dependent Active Duty ( AD ) military personnel retire military personnel ( direct intervention participant ) AD retired military personnel live ( indirect intervention participant ) . The primary outcome weight change baseline 2 year adult dependent . The objective study compare CBP HWL intervention deliver adult dependent AD retire military personnel measure weight loss effect adult dependent AD retire military personnel live . The work hypothesis HWL intervention result significantly great weight loss 2 year CBP intervention intent-to-treat analysis adult dependent AD retire military personnel , great weight loss HWL associate improved management hunger great adherence goal reduce energy intake . The researcher plan test central hypothesis accomplish study objective follow technical objective : 1 . Conduct randomize trial compare HWL intervention CBP intervention 2 year adult dependent AD retire military personnel . The primary outcome weight change baseline 2 year . The work hypothesis randomization HWL intervention result significantly great weight loss 2 year randomization CBP intervention , great weight loss HWL intervention associate great adherence goal reduce energy intake hunger . 2 . Examine effect intervention deliver adult dependent AD retire military personnel weight AD retire military personnel . The working hypothesis , base preliminary data , `` ripple '' effect program benefit intervention participant AD retire military personnel live ; specifically , overweight obese AD retire military personnel lose weight partner randomize HWL intervention compare CBP intervention , weight loss AD retire military personnel indirectly expose intervention proportional weight loss adult dependent directly expose . 3 . Compare effect two intervention change cardiometabolic risk factor . The work hypothesis significantly great improvement baseline 2 year key cardiometabolic risk factor adult dependent enrol HWL intervention compare CBP intervention , difference group predict difference weight loss .</detailed_description>
