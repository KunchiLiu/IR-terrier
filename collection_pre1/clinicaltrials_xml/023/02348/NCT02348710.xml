	<detailed_description>This study test theory-based intervention increase level exercise among breast cancer survivor , order help self-manage long-term treatment side effect . The study focus outcome expectation ( OEs ) , significant yet understudied construct central behavior change theory . OEs refer people expect obtain avoid engage behavior ; thus , people exercise believe produce desire outcomes . This randomize controlled trial test multicomponent intervention increase exercise OEs ass effect OE change exercise intention level exercise . Sixty early stage ( IA IIB ) inactive breast cancer survivor recruit Duke Cancer Institute . Participants randomize exercise OE intervention attention control group . Both group receive American Cancer Society diet exercise guideline accelerometer . The intervention group also receive OE workbook contain self-directed activity increase OEs focus OE importance ( value place outcome ( ) ) , certainty ( perceived probability outcome ( ) occur ) ; accessibility ( frequency outcome ( ) thought ) . The attention control group receive workbook containing activity focus diet , rather exercise . OE importance , OE certainty , OE accessibility , exercise intention , exercise , self-efficacy ( potential co-variate ) assess online survey baseline , 4- , 8- , 12-weeks post-intervention . At time point , accelerometer data collect objective exercise measure . Specific aim study : ( 1 ) examine trajectory OE importance , certainty accessibility participant OE intervention arm compare participant attention control arm , across four time point : baseline , 4- , 8- 12-weeks post-intervention ; ( 2 ) examine trajectory exercise intention total weekly minute exercise , participant OE intervention arm compare participant attention control arm , across four time point : baseline , 4 , 8 12 week post-intervention . If intervention increase exercise among breast cancer survivor may lead improved survivorship duration quality life . The intervention implement readily clinic setting support survivor exercise thus experience well long-term outcome . This study also provide foundation develop nurse scientist 's program research focus design theory-based exercise intervention chronically ill population .</detailed_description>
