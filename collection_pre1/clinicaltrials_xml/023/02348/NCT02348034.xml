	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Exploring Ability Negative Pressure Wound Therapy ( NPWT ) Reduce Colorectal Surgical Site Infections ( SSI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial commence recruitment participant assessment potential eligibility . Those recruited trial sign informed consent day surgery . Perioperative measure include bowel preparation Fleet Phospho-soda , preoperative shave electric clipper 1 hour operation , intravenous prophylactic antibiotic administer 30 minute incision , repeat OR operation last 3 hour , discontinue within 24 h operation . In procedure , chlorhexidine solution apply skin achieve preoperative skin antisepsis , usual reusable disposable surgical gown , drape , gloving use . The type surgical procedure colorectal resection malignant benign condition colon , rectum anal canal via laparotomy wound . The type incision either vertical midline transverse abdominal incision . Laparotomy wound close primarily mass closure technique utilize loop polydioxanone ( PDS ) Nylon suture . Skin subcutaneous tissue approximate use stainless-steel staple . During surgery , assessment eligibility ( include wound classification ) complete , eligible , participant randomize one two treatment arm - group A ( conventional dressing ) group B ( Prevena dress ) . After surgical wound close , assign dress - conventional dressing ( Mepore ) Prevena dress - apply . For participant group A ( conventional dressing ) wound inspect as-needed basis postoperative day 1-6 assess SSI ( day 0 = day surgery ) . On postoperative day 7 , dress remove . If participant hospital , wound care nurse study staff remove dress examine wound SSI . If participant discharge postoperative day 7 , home care nurse participant 's physician remove dressing . The patient send home Post-Op Day 7 follow-up form , instruct provide form home care nurse physician complete assessment SSI . For participant randomize group B ( Prevena dress ) , wound care nurse study staff inspect wound daily postoperative day 1-6 ( day 0 = day surgery ) ass proper function Prevena dressing . If participant discharge postoperative day 7 , wound care nurse study staff contact participant daily check proper function Prevena dress . On postoperative day 7 , Prevena dress remove . If participant hospital , wound care nurse study staff ( resident Surgeons ) remove dress assess wound SSI . If participant discharge postoperative day 7 , home care nurse participant 's physician remove dressing . The patient send home Post-Op Day 7 follow-up form , instruct provide form home care nurse physician complete sign SSI . If SSI suspect , participant advise visit clinic assessment SSI study team . In case possible participant visit clinic assessment SSI study team , participant send home SSI Confirmation form complete participant 's physician . The wound care nurse study staff conduct post-discharge follow-up postoperative day 14 ( ± 2 day ) 21 ( ± 2 day ) telephone family physician participant check whether sign SSI . If SSI suspect , participant advise visit clinic assessment SSI study team . If possible , participant instruct ask physician complete SSI Confirmation form . On postoperative day 30 ( ± 7 day ) , participant see clinic treat surgeon part treatment follow-up plan , wound assess SSI . For participant able come clinic , study team contact participant family physician telephone check whether sign SSI . If SSI suspect , participant advise visit clinic assessment SSI study team . If possible , participant instruct ask physician complete SSI Confirmation form . As described , participant 12 study visit ( 11 schedule visit , include day surgery , plus one clinic visit suspicion SSI ) . At point , however , SSI confirm , participant undergo study visit .</detailed_description>
