	<brief_title>Imaging Extrastriatal Dopamine Release Tobacco Smokers Nonsmokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : To determine sex difference amphetamine-induced dopamine ( DA ) release healthy tobacco smoker nonsmoker . FLB-457 use several PET center recently approve use Yale University PET Center . We would like determine whether sex difference amphetamine induce DA release healthy tobacco smoker nonsmoker . Specifically , 40 healthy tobacco smoker 40 healthy nonsmoker magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan follow another day two FLB scan ( ideally , two PET scan carry day ) . Starting 3 hour second PET scan , amphetamine ( 0.4mg/kg , PO ) administer . Aim 2 : To determine sex difference amphetamine-induced dopamine release tobacco smoker Aim 1 treatment guanfacine . Guanfacine give different protocol . We plan determine whether guanfacine treatment differentially inhibit amphetamine-induced DA release men smoker Aim 1 . After first scan , 40 healthy tobacco smoker Aim 1 take guanfacine 3 week another set FLB scan ( ideally , two PET scan carry day ) . Starting 3 hour second PET scan , amphetamine ( 0.4mg/kg , PO ) administer , . The set scan separate least 21 day , due schedule technical difficulty second set may schedule 6 week first set .</detailed_description>
