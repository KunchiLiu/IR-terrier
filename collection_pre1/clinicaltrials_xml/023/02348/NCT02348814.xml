	<detailed_description>Preliminary data suggest cholesterol retinoid metabolism tightly link cell , prompt u examine relationship set obesity diabetes . Specific aim develop test follow hypothesis : 1 ) Quantifying liver fibrosis continuous variable predict clinically significant outcome fatty liver disease related metabolic syndrome ; 2 ) In prospective cohort patient , quantify liver fibrosis correlate strongly tissue circulate retinoid metabolite , commonly measure serum marker . This study offer major innovation perform accurate fibrosis quantification without human intervention post-analysis correction . In addition , test whether subtle difference quantify fibrosis impact outcome give clinical stage disease severity , possible measure fibrosis continuous variable , categorical one . We use disease-independent approach evaluate anti-fibrotic agent clinical trial evaluate diagnostic marker . We also test whether novel diagnostic marker , retinoid storage , correlate liver disease progression human . We propose extend study address fatty liver disease , NAFLD/NASH , context adult patient abnormal liver test , fatty liver identify imaging , physical obesity , diabetes . Clinical variable outcomes record analyzed include : morphology ( age , gender , ethnicity , height , weight/BMI , waist circumference steatosis image study ) ; biochemistry ( glucose intolerance diabetes , complete blood count , metabolic panel , liver function test , cholesterol panel , insulin , vitamin D level ) ; clinical outcome ( date liver disease diagnosis estimate duration disease , list liver transplant list , occurrence liver transplant re-transplant , presence cancer , death ) ; medication ( current previous prescribed , herbal , supplement take diabetes , dyslipidemia , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , stroke ) ; disease exacerbation/modifying factor ( presence chronic liver diseases NASH + HIV , liver toxin alcohol consumption , weight gain , worsen diabetes ) . Data collect subject complete eight visit 24-month period . Assessments include morphometric measurement , blood collection laboratory analysis completion dietary history report .</detailed_description>
