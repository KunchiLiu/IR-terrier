	<brief_summary>Both artemether-lumefantrine chloroquine currently use recommend Malaysian Ministry Health blood stage treatment non-severe P. vivax P. knowlesi malaria . Microscopic misdiagnosis Plasmodium species remain large issue Sabah , Malaysia elsewhere . In order facilitate potential policy change unify ACT guideline malaria specie Sabah artemether-lumefantrine need evaluate P. vivax malaria . Preliminary data recently complete RCT evaluate artesunate-mefloquine v chloroquine P. vivax show 36 % P. vivax recurrence chloroquine monotherapy day 28 post treatment without primaquine . Based data blood stage chloroquine treatment failure rate also evaluate context standard concurrent ( rather delay ) liver stage primaquine dosing , due potential blood stage synergistic effect addition know decreased recurrence rate . As artemether-lumefantrine one current first line Ministry Health ACTs use Sabah low adverse event profile compare artesunate-mefloquine , recommended appropriate ACT evaluate chloroquine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Artemether-lumefantrine v Chloroquine Uncomplicated P. Vivax Malaria Malaysia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria due infection P. vivax currently estimate 390 million episode per year worldwide , substantial morbidity cause recurrent nature infection , associate anaemia adverse effect pregnancy , ability cause severe disease death . The majority malaria case Plasmodium species Malaysia Eastern state Sabah , despite around 36-fold reduction incidence since implementation malaria eradication program 1961 , minimum estimate base unpublished microscopy data Sabah State public health record still detailed 8685 malaria case 2009-2011 . While P. vivax account 30-50 % figure currently , study demonstrate overall transmission rate country previously endemic malaria decline proportion case attributable P. vivax increase . Mixed P. falciparum / P. vivax infection also likely underestimated area co-endemicity , high rate recurrence P. vivax show study follow treatment apparent P. falciparum mono-infection mixed Plasmodium spp . infection . Malaysian Ministry Health guideline currently recommend chloroquine primaquine first line treatment erythrocytic hypnozoite life stage uncomplicated P. vivax malaria respectively . While resistance chloroquine previously document Sabah also Peninsular Malaysia , unstable transmission dynamic recent reduction P. vivax incidence due public health measure mean current risk chloroquine-resistant P.vivax transmission likely low . Despite , due document increase resistance surround country include Indonesia , Thailand , Vietnam , PNG , transient population migrant worker , recent concern fail efficacy hypnozoite eradication primaquine , need ongoing therapeutic efficacy monitoring recommend . There also grow support artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACT ) unify first line treatment choice area co-endemic P. falciparum P. vivax , adopt small number country include PNG , Solomon Islands , Vanuatu Papua , Indonesia , due regional increase chloroquine-resistant P. vivax , ongoing concern microscopic misdiagnosis Plasmodium species . This also particularly relevant P. knowlesi malaria , frequently misidentified microscopy P. falciparum P. malariae due morphological similarity early trophozoite , late trophozoite schizont life stage respectively , study show 80 % P. malariae 7-12 % P. falciparum region actually P. knowlesi definitively evaluate PCR . Misdiagnosis concern treatment implication , although P. knowlesi show respond well ACT chloroquine , unlike P. malariae , knowlesi malaria rapid 24-hour replication rate cause hyperparasitaemia , severe complication fatal outcome , inadvertent use chloroquine widely chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum may also fatal consequence . Previous reluctance use ACTs presume chloroquine-sensitive P.vivax area center concern efficacy cost . The advent generically produce ACTs improve cost-related issue , recent Cochrane review clinical trial look use ACT versus chloroquine uncomplicated vivax malaria show ACTs equivalent chloroquine prevent recurrent parasitaemia first 28 day ( RR 1 , 95 % CI 0.30 3.39 ) , long half live mefloquine piperaquine superior 6-8 week follow , few recurrent episode day 28 ( RR 0.47 , 95 % CI 0.29 0.76 ) . This post treatment prophylaxis benefit longer act agent extend reduction gametocyte carriage , delay relapse re-infection decrease risk anaemia development , contribute decrease transmissibility health care cost .</detailed_description>
