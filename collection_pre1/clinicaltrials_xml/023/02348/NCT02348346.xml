	<detailed_description>Introduction background Background The annual epidemiological report annual report EARS-NET European Centre Disease Prevention Control ( ECDC ) describe continue deteriorate situation European country . Antimicrobial resistance increase Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate surveillance data show high percentage ESBL-positive isolates . Of particular concern increase percentage Klebsiella pneumoniae bacterial group resistant carbapanems ( last line antibiotic ) . Furthermore , percentage methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus still high remain public health priority On give day 5.7 % patient European hospital healthcare-associated infection ( HAI ) prevalence least one HAI 19.5 % patient admit Intensive Care Units . HAIs accountable least 37000 attributable death annual financial loss estimate â‚¬7 billion reflect 16 million extra day hospital stay . Each year 4 131 000 patient affect approximately 4 544 100 episode HAIs . The total number HAIs European long-term care facility ( LTCFs ) estimate 4.2 million per year . 8 % 12 % patient developed country confront adverse event ( AE ) hospital stay lead ( permanent ) disability even dead . As HAIs belong one important AEs considerable economic impact prolong hospital length stay , increase readmission rate necessitate additional ambulatory care extra societal cost . The total preventable direct medical cost AEs Netherlands estimate 1 % national health care budget ( 94.2 billion 2013 - Statistics Netherlands ) . Environmental cleanliness As antimicrobial resistance major overall deteriorate public health problem international cooperation necessary . Continued progress need implement improve programme prevention control antimicrobial resistance HAIs . Environmental cleanliness might one important initiative reduce HAIs . Hospital surface heavily contaminate bacteria high number surface closest patient . Bed rail , nurse call button , curtain , towel dispenser , door handle , sink , floor , clinical information station , medical device , stethoscope , staff toilet etc . Actually , general hospital ward Intensive Care Units load abundance potential pathogen . Surviving day , week even month environment . Colonizing patient bacteria hospital environment get HAIs even die . As ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAPs ) result nosocomial microorganism environment play important role acquisition pathogenic bacteria contaminate health care worker hand equipment . Furthermore , ICUs ward struggle colonized patient ESBL-bacteria sink eventually lead dead outbreak group A streptococcus infection contaminate curtain . As key healthcare-associated pathogen capacity persist week month hospital surface indirect transmission serious threat , especially antimicrobial resistance increase . Hospitalization room previous patient colonize infected nosocomial pathogen ( e.g . MRSA , VRE , multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter , Pseudomonas C. difficile ) show risk factor colonization infection pathogen next patient . Furthermore , important risk factor hand glove contamination healthcare worker multidrug-resistant bacteria demonstrate positive environmental culture . To decrease frequency level contamination environmental surface Centre Disease Control Prevention recommend routine disinfection medical equipment environmental surface prevent spread potential pathogen hospital ward ICU . Improved room clean show decrease risk MRSA , VRE C. difficile acquisition . Unfortunately , environmental clean frequently inadequate . Less 50 % hospital room surface adequately clean disinfect even environmental service personnel . Environmental service personnel low wage , time pressure clean room quickly high turn-over rate patient . Novel material clean technology develop ultraviolet germicidal irradiation ( UVGI ) hydrogen peroxide vapor ( HPV ) . However , technology expensive use terminal cleaning routine daily care . Self-disinfecting surface may overcome problem . Once applied antimicrobial surface continuously reduce bioburden nosocomial pathogen prevent transmission decrease HAIs . MVX One self-disinfecting product MVX . MVX contain titanium dioxide use nanotechnology available use health sector . Working photocatalyticum generates , presence light , hydroxy radical oxygen radical least five year coat hospital surface ( durability test TUV Rheinland ) . Laboratory test show MVX effective kill bacteria , virus fungi . To best knowledge one study examine efficacy titanium dioxide reduce MRSA contamination hospital environment 19 . In cross-sectional observational study two ICU isolation room coat four bed 'Intermediate Care Area ' ( ICA ) . However , study serious limitation . As 81 % sample ( N=698 ) take untreated surface high chance sample bias . Especially 9 % sample take ICA , contain four six coat beds/rooms , 48 % ICU 42 % general ward . Furthermore , 10.6 % sample positive ( N=74 ) really doubt validity study small sample size . Finally , country low prevalence MRSA ( e.g . Netherlands ) interest prevalence Enterobacteriaecae non-MRSA ( potential pathogenic microorganism ) use ( semi ) quantitative method . This make positive result report effect MVX laboratory evaluation still confirm clinical setting . After get CE-marking Gelderse Vallei Hospital Ede , Netherlands , first hospital Europe study efficacy MVX Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) .</detailed_description>
