	<brief_title>Aspirin Zileuton Biomarker Expression Nasal Tissue Current Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To analyze impact combine treatment acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) ( aspirin ) zileuton smoking-related gene expression signature nasal epithelium current smoker analyze difference ASA zileuton intervention placebo control . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess impact ASA zileuton three lung cancer gene signature ( 80-gene bronchial signature , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [ PI3K ] pathway gene signature nasal diagnostic gene signature ) compare placebo control . II . To determine whether change smoking-related gene expression signature three lung cancer gene signature nasal epithelium persists 10-14 day agent intervention . III . To measure urinary prostaglandin E metabolite ( PGE-M ) leukotriene E ( 4 ) ( LTE [ 4 ] ) level current smoker ASA zileuton . IV . To assess safety current smoker 12 week exposure ASA zileuton . V. To evaluate gender effect modulatory effect ASA zileuton smoke related-gene expression signature . VI . To explore effect ASA zileuton metabolomics profile arachidonic acid pathway . VII . To explore , discovery-driven fashion , effect ASA zileuton whole-genome gene expression . VIII . To analyze impact ASA zileuton karyometric analysis buccal cell . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive aspirin orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) zileuton PO twice daily ( BID ) 12 week absence unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive aspirin placebo PO QD zileuton placebo PO BID 12 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 week .</detailed_description>
