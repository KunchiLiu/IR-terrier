For , approximately 60 hypertensive , anti-hypertensive medication , select randomly distribute three group : home-based isometric handgrip training ( HBT ) , supervise isometric handgrip training ( ST ) control group ( CG ) .Subjects assign HBT ST train three time per week total 12 week , perform bout isometric handgrip exercise : four set 2-min isometric contraction ( use alternate hand ) 30 % maximal voluntary contraction . However , subject HBT group conduct training without daily supervision . Subjects randomize CG encourage increase level physical activity make healthy eating , without , however , receive specific recommendations.Baseline 12 week intervention , follow cardiovascular risk indicator obtain : blood pressure , arterial stiffness , cardiac autonomic modulation , vasodilatory capacity oxidative inflammatory stress marker , addition microalbuminuria . For data analysis , addition descriptive statistic , two-way ANOVA mixed model apply within group comparison . If premise test meet . The level significance adopt p &lt; 0.05 .</brief_summary>
