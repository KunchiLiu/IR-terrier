	<brief_title>Treating Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ( CML ) Chronic Phase ( CP ) With Dasatinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The advent Imatinib market 2001 change treatment paradigm CML . Seven-year follow-up IRIS trial reveal estimate overall survival 86 % newly diagnose CML patient treat Imatinib . In June 2006 , U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) grant accelerated approval Dasatinib treat adult CP-CML resistant disease intolerant prior therapy , include Imatinib . The FDA convert Dasatinib regular approval May 2009 , confirmation treatment 's safety effectiveness . On October 28 , 2010 , FDA grant accelerated approval Dasatinib treatment newly diagnose adult patient CML-CP . Dasatinib enter thereby marketplace TKIs include Nilotinib . According summary product characteristic brochure Dasatinib ( Sprycel® ) indicate treatment adult patient : - Newly diagnose Ph+ CML In chronic phase . - Chronic , accelerate blast phase CML resistance intolerance prior therapy include Imatinib mesilate . - Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia lymoid blast CML resistance intolerance prior therapy . A phase III study ( DASISION ) Dasatinib vs. Imatinib could proof Dasatinib induce significantly high faster rate complete cytogenetic response major molecular response compare Imatinib . Since achieve complete cytogenetic response within 12 month associate well long-term , progression-free survival , Dasatinib may improve long-term outcome among patient newly diagnose chronic-phase CML . Nevertheless , data require obtain additional information clinical benefit Dasatinib . CML require ongoing treatment assessment treatment milestone order manage disease properly . Dasatinib approve treatment newly diagnose PH+ CP-CML CML chronic accelerate phase blast crisis patient resistant intolerant prior therapy include Imatinib . Although Imatinib demonstrate exceptional efficacy clinical trial , mostly chronic phase CML , lack publish data CML manage real-life clinical practice setting . Therefore non-interventional study design collect real-life data CML-treatment Dasatinib clinical routine respect first second line treatment and/or switch setting ( within 1st line 1st line TKI 2nd line Dasatinib ) . Emphasis lie health care provide register doctor 's practice CML patient involve clinical trial treat .</detailed_description>
