	<brief_summary>Mechanical neck pain musculoskeletal disorder usually associate work absenteeism . Myofascial release therapy ( MRT ) currently development treatment mechanical neck pain one main focal point . However , paucity study report effectiveness . For purpose randomize single-blind parallel group study design compare effectiveness MRT manual therapy ( MT ) treat occupational mechanical neck pain . The sample ( n=59 ) randomly assign two therapeutic intervention program . Group I patient treat MT Group II patient treat MRT . Variables study intensity neck pain , cervical disability , quality life ( QoL ) , craniovertebral angle range cervical motion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A variety physiotherapy intervention use treat mechanical neck pain ( NP ) , proven effective . The number study clinical effectiveness MT technique , myofascial release therapy ( MRT ) , see marked increase . MRT relatively new therapy increase acceptance implementation daily clinical work physiotherapist . However , paucity study biomechanical alteration associate mechanical NP treatment MRT , consequently , clinical benefit MRT remain unclear . The purpose study assess clinical efficacy MRT occupational mechanical NP determine MRT advantage another MT protocol include MRT . An experimental parallel group study design . It single-blind ( assessor ) randomize controlled clinical trial . Patients FREMAP - Mutual Insurance Company Occupational Accidents Diseases - participate study January 2010 December 2010 . A total 71 patient ask participate initial screening , 8 meet inclusion criterion , 2 decline participate study personal reason , 2 could participate reason . 59 patient NP randomly distribute two group accord two therapeutic intervention program . Group I ( n=29 ; 18 females/11 male ; mean age : 38.24 ± 11.35 years-old ) treat MT Group II ( n=30 ; 15 females/15 male ; mean age : 38.20 ± 10.70 years-old ) treat MRT . The intervention group consist analgesic treatment accordance guideline FREMAP Protocol treatment mechanical NP . The analgesic part protocol include superficial thermotherapy ( infrared lamp ) transcutaneous electrical stimulation ( TENS ) . Additionally , Group I treat MT Group II MRT . There 10 treatment session distribute within 4 successive week three session apply first third week two session apply second fourth week . MT provide one physiotherapist , MRT perform another physiotherapist , FREMAP . The session hold nearly 50 minute , completion intervention determine FREMAP . Analgesic therapy consist application superficial thermotherapy infrared lamp ( Infra 2000 , Enraf Nonius ) TENS ( TENSMED 911 , Enraf Nonius ) . The 250-watts infrared lamp focus distance 50 cm cervical area 15 minute . TENS application employ 80 Hz frequency , 150 µs pulse duration , 50x50 mm electrode ( Gel-Trode , Enraf Nonius ) place painful metamers area 20 minute . The additional treatment apply group 15 minute . MT technique include : ( ) anterior-posterior side-shift cervical spine ; ( ii ) muscle energy technique involve side-bending cervical spine ; ( iii ) neuromuscular technique restrict C1-C2 rotation ; ( iv ) inhibitive occipital distraction ; ( v ) cervical stretching : post-isometric relaxation upper trapezius , scalene sternocleidomastoid muscle . The MRT include : ( ) cranial base release , adjust relation rectus capitis posterior muscle dura mater ( Hack et al. , 1995 ) ; ( ii ) gross release sternocleidomastoid muscle ; ( iii ) release suprahyoid infrahyoid muscle ; ( iv ) release retrohyoid fascia .</detailed_description>
