	<brief_title>A Smartphone Application Evaluate Energy Expenditure Duration Activities Overweight Obese People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There grow interest evaluate physical activity energy expenditure ( EE ) provide feedback user . The use mass-market sensor accelerometers offer promise solution general public due grow smartphone market last decade . Two previous study allow propose function name PredEE , test normal-weighted volunteer . This EE estimation function test improved data collect 43 overweight volunteer equip smartphones two three research sensor ( Fitmate , Armband Actiheart control condition , Armband Actiheart free-living condition ) . Research sensor ' data serf reference evaluation improvement propose function . This EE estimation function use smartphone technology dedicate light- moderate-intensity activity , investigator believe new way help people control daily physical activity level .</detailed_description>
