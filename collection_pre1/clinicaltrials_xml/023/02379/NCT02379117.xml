	<brief_summary>Food intake mainly control interaction gut brain ( homeostatic control ) environment , food exposure , mood past experience ( hedonic control ) play major role . The link gut brain mainly control enteroendocrine cell ( EC ) . These cell bowel sense nutrient food link brain control much eat . They make number hormone link brain control one 's eat habit . Crohn 's disease ( CD ) inflammatory disease bowel present number symptom include weight loss loss appetite . We think time ago increase number function EC could play central role . Since carry work show CD EC increase number produce hormone meal . This finding could negative effect food intake . This would one explanation symptom commonly experience patient . In CD thus feel might imbalance appetite control . We expect increasingly sensitive gut food intake subdue mood perception food reward imbalance lead decrease food reward consequently decrease food intake . This study carry use Healthy Volunteers CD patient . We plan measure food intake though telephone interview plan analyse eat behaviour 5 questionnaires.This study help u improve understanding control food intake . This particularly important patient CD routinely lose weight appetite .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE Crohn 's disease ( CD ) patient present variety luminal extra-luminal symptom nutritional abnormality common poorly study [ 1 ] problem disease [ 2 ] . Apart disease burden repeat surgery , reduce appetite [ 3 ] associate symptom nausea undoubtedly contribute , major impact quality life . Appetite satiation , process meal terminate , involve complex interaction homeostatic hedonic factor . While hypothalamus central homeostatic control food intake , neural circuit integrate environmental emotional cue constitute hedonic drive appetite regulation . The homeostatic control food intake govern enteroendocrine-gut brain axis . Enteroendocrine cell ( EC ) play pivotal role orchestrate physiological function gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract . Sensing nutrient content lumen , secrete multiple peptide amine control gut secretory motor function . Gut hormones act vagal afferent GI tract , directly relay key central nervous system ( CNS ) nucleus interface within hypothalamus cortical area regulate food intake . CD patient active small bowel inflammation show significant up-regulation EC cell increase ileal expression chromogranin A [ 4 , 5 ] , glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) [ 4 ] , key transcription factor stem cell EC differentiation pathway [ 4 ] , plasma polypeptide YY ( PYY ) [ 3 ] , cholecystokinin ( CCK ) [ 6 ] level reduction key enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 expression [ 7 ] . This increase plasma peptide level associate symptom nausea anorexia , symptom , tissue plasma EC-peptide expression decrease normality remission [ 3 ] . An increase EC expression tissue plasma level might affect appetite regulation increase CNS signal . Fatty-acids infused gut , lead CCK-dependent increase CNS activity area relate homeostatic control feed brainstem , pons , hypothalamus , cerebellum motor cortical area [ 8 ] . Glucose show decrease response upper hypothalamus [ 9 ] , possibly via GLP-1-mediated pathway [ 10 ] . Ghrelin PYY know homeostatic CNS signalling property play hedonic role control food intake [ 11 ] . In effect , increase plasma PYY GLP-1 see Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery obese subject parenteral administration [ 12 ] associate low activation brain-hedonic food response healthier eat behaviour [ 13 ] . In CD , expect subdue reward value food , postulate would aversive , inappropriately impair appetite food intake . We hypothesize CD small bowel inflammation observe change eat behaviour loss hedonic drive food reward response accentuate homeostatic response . STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE PURPOSE The overall purpose study quantify food intake patient active Crohn 's disease compare remission healthy age , BMI gender-matched healthy cohort volunteer . We quantify eat behaviour trait patient cohort active disease repeat remission . These data compare healthy volunteer . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE The primary objective quantify food intake patient active CD compare HV . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES The secondary objective study ) quantify food intake patient active CD compare inactive disease . b ) quantify change appetite eat behaviour patient active CD compare HV inactive CD measure appetite-related questionnaire</detailed_description>
