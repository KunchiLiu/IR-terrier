	<brief_summary>Background : - Sometimes stem cell transplant , donor cell attack recipient cell cause tissue damage . This call acute graft-versus-host-disease ( GVHD ) . Researchers want see bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( BMSC ) help treat GVHD . BMSC travel body help repair tissue . The BMSC study grow bone marrow healthy volunteer . Objectives : - To test whether BMSC safe use soon GVHD diagnose see body immune system respond BMSC . Eligibility : - People 4 year old stem cell transplant NIH acute GVHD . People certain previous immunosuppressive therapy may ineligible . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . They GVHD exam , include skin stool test . They must function central line . - Participation last 11 week : 4 8 week cell infusion , follow-up rest week . - Up 12 cell infusion : - Participants come clinic twice weekly . - They get medicine prevent side effect ( like Tylenol Benadryl ) . - BMSC give small plastic tube arm vein IV catheter . It last 20 60 minute . - Participants monitor 1 hour . - Follow-up visit : Up twice week , participant physical exam blood test . They may GVHD exam . - Participants tissue biopsy outside study ask send sample study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Treatment Acute Graft Versus Host Disease With Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Corticosteroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study evaluate addition bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( BMSC ) infusion corticosteroids early treatment acute graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . Acute GVHD major complication follow allogeneic stem cell transplant . GVHD occur T-lymphocytes donor graft respond signal recipient cell cause tissue damage . This process lead organ injury , increase risk infection , graft failure . Corticosteroids use primary therapy acute GVHD decade , guideline currently recommend use front line treatment . Recent prospective data Blood Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network show GVHD cure half patient steroids alone . Patients respond steroid consider steroid-resistant , associate much bad survival . It possible predict patient go steroid-resistant GVHD measuring plasma concentration molecule call suppression tumorigenicity 2 ( ST2 ) . BMSC infusion use treat steroid-resistant acute GVHD successfully , despite track record safety , little know use BMSC early treatment setting . The main objective study explore feasibility administer BMSC within 5 day diagnosis acute GVHD . Our study first time use ST2 biomarker accurately assign acute GVHD steroid refractory sensitive , explore change ST2 biological marker BMSC function correlation clinical response . In process study , assess safety feasibility early treatment accord regimen , obtain estimate efficacy important GVHD therapy time point , determine treatment BMSC prevent progression GVHD patient high risk GVHD progression measure biomarkers . The Cell Processing Section Department Transfusion Medicine Clinical Center NIH develop BMSC repository NIH . The NIH BMSC third party , early passage product base EU manufacture approach . The NIH BMSC cellular product administer safely transplant recipient steroid-resistant acute GVHD phase I study ( protocol 12-H-0010 , IND # 14596 ) conduct March 2012 October 2012 NIH . This pilot study continuation previous study open allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipient NIH ( age great equal 4 yr ) de novo acute GVHD require systemic therapy either directly allogeneic transplantation follow treatment donor lymphocyte infusion . Subjects receive BMSC infusion ( target dose 2 time 10 ( 6 ) BMSC/kg 12 dos ) addition standard upfront therapy corticosteroid . The primary endpoint proportion patient without treatment-related severe adverse event ( TRSAE ) day +56 . Responses assess day +28 +56 initial diagnosis . Responses correlate change GVHD biomarkers include ST2 , Reg3a , TNFR1 , IL-6 . Subjects enrol first diagnosis acute GVHD , first BMSC infusion give within 120 hour first dose corticosteroid . BMSC infusion give twice weekly first 4 week . Subjects complete response end week 4 receive infusion . All subject receive BMSC infusion weekly four additional week . Safety monitor continuously stop rule toxicity base treatment-related serious adverse event rate . Research sample drawn regular interval explore biological correlate response investigate mechanism action BMSC .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : History grade acute GVHD require systemic therapy allogeneic stem cell transplant DLI . Subjects must receive allogeneic stem cell transplant NIH diagnose acute GVHD . Acute GVHD define use NIH consensus definition inclusive classic acute ( less equal 100 day transplant DLI , presence acute GVHD feature , absence chronic GVHD feature ) AND persistent/recurrent/late onset acute ( &gt; 100 day transplant DLI , presence acute GVHD feature , absence chronic GVHD feature ) . Subjects stage I II skin ( overall Grade I ) isolate upper gastrointestinal involvement eligible treat physician deems systemic corticosteroid treatment indicate . Biopsy confirmation GVHD desirable , require study entry enrollment delay await biopsy pathology result . Patients must diagnose first episode acute GVHD require systemic corticosteroid associate precede administration cellular therapy include stem cell donor lymphocyte infusion . Patients treat GVHD associate another cellular therapy product ( e.g . prior allogeneic transplant DLI ) allow study . Previous immunosuppressive therapy The patient must receive systemic immune suppressive therapy treatment new acute GVHD ( e.g . pentostatin , etanercept , denileukin difitox , etc . ) , except maximum 120 hour prior corticosteroid therapy . This include immune suppressive therapy GVHD prophylaxis ( e.g . calcineurin inhibitor , sirolimus , MMF , etc. ) . It expect patient receive GVHD prophylaxis part transplant regimen , thus patient develop acute GVHD GVHD prophylaxis still consider eligible . Concurrent addition locallyacting steroid therapy ( skin cream , oral budesonide , locallyacting steroid preparation ) allow . There one exception stipulation : Use oral medication MMF ( addition systemic corticosteroid ) treatment acute GVHD allow . MMF commonly give early treatment acute GVHD , show improve outcome compare steroid alone randomize , prospective study ; therefore , treatment MMF exclude patient BMSC treatment . Age : Age great equal 4 year old allow . Birth control : Subjects childbearing childfathering potential must willing use medically acceptable form birth control , include abstinence , treat study . Informed consent : Signed informed consent and/or assent require . Assent educational material provide , review , patient age 18 . The informed consent process begin recognition patient eligibility . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Breast feed pregnant female ( due unknown risk fetus newborn ) . Known allergy gentamicin .</criteria>
