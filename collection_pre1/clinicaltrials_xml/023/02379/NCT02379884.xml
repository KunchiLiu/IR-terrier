	<brief_title>Mechanical Ventilation Internal Medicine Elderly Patients - Choosing Wisely</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The age population associate increased morbidity , one hand , technological advance provide life-sustaining treatment , result increased number mechanically ventilated patient Internal Medicine ward . In previous study investigator find half hospitalization day intermediate care unit Internal Medicine ward utilized old patient end life . The mortality 6 month time admission great 70 % , unrelated type treatment . The majority elderly patient survive acute stage transfer chronic long-term care hospital . The Public Health System Israel invest costly resource provide care mechanically ventilate patient acute chronic care setting , spite unproved benefit quality life life expectancy . Aims study 1 . Identification patient factor affect decision-making process outcome mechanically ventilate patient Internal Medicine ward acute care hospital . 2 . Development predictive model classify mechanically ventilated patient outcome basis patient characteristic admission factor involve decision-making . 3 . Assessment medical resource investment accord study model group . Study hypothesis Identification parameter predict well outcome potential rehabilitation elderly mechanically ventilate internal medicine patient , versus patient poorer outcome would need palliative care . Methods The study prospective observational study carry five Internal Medicine ward Medical Intensive Care Unit Rambam Health Care Campus Haifa , Israel . All patient require mechanical ventilation include . Patients ' medical demographic data obtain hospital computerized record system . Data gather regard event prior ventilation indication mechanical ventilation . In-hospital post-admission outcome monitor . Mortality 6 month obtain Israel National Population Registry . Descriptive statistical analysis perform , multivariate logistic regression analysis apply identify variable contribute need ventilation outcome . Importance study The approval 2005 Dying Patient Act Israel , allow withhold certain life-sustaining intervention end life . However , intervention mechanical ventilation commence , Law permit withdraw , make decision ventilate patient irreversible . There thus clear need improve decision-making process relate undertaking mechanical ventilation elderly internal medicine patient . In addition , investigator believe study highlight issue bring policy maker establish practical tool health care professional . The investigator also hope study incite general public attention address issue advance directive regard undergoing invasive treatment mechanical ventilation end life . Finally , investigator consider adoption evidence-based approach undertake mechanical ventilation , consideration patient ' advanced directive , health care provider community in-patient setting , lead good utilization health resource improvement end life care .</detailed_description>
