The new approach base improve aspect maternal nurturing behavior well mother-child co-regulation , important early development . Since young child developmental deficit often easily upset , mother teach co-regulate child comfort calm interaction 11 clinic visit .

There many co-regulatory process embed synchronous reciprocal interaction cross neurophysiological neurobehavioral domain ( Als , 1999 ) . A necessary detrimental separation mother infant create critical period mother-infant co-regulation developing . Regardless NICU well-baby nursery care , physiological challenge associate born soon , along disturbance normal mother-infant interaction key factor underlie risk early late preterm infant broad range early midlife disorder ( DeBoer , et al. , 1984 include late preterm , find another reference ) . This study compare common early intervention occupational , physical , speech therapy Family Nurture Intervention ( FNI ) , institute age 3 4 preschool age child developmental delay . This developmental time point delay include deficit emotion regulation , language , cognition , attention identifiable . The investigator hypothesize Family Nurture Intervention alter wide range physiological regulatory capacity result improved index mother psychological child neurobehavioral outcome .</detailed_description>
