	<brief_summary>The investigator look whether new type nebuliser ( machine use deliver drug airway ) well deliver drug lung people Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) , compare current nebuliser use Emergency Departments . The investigator randomly allocate patient come Emergency Department acute episode COPD either standard nebuliser group new nebuliser group . Both group receive medication , method deliver different .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aerogen Nebuliser Versus Standard Nebulised Therapy Acute Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease present significant burden Emergency Departments acute medical service , account approximately 90,000 hospital admission year , average stay last 11 day . COPD account 10 % acute hospital admission , therefore method improve health outcome reduce burden acute service benefit patient twofold . Severity acute COPD base clinical indicator patient perceived breathlessness , arterial blood gas analysis respiratory rate . Although breathlessness subjective marker , multiple score system devise attempt standardise order see objective improvement patient . One commonly use repeatedly validated score system BORG score , show effectively demonstrate improvement breathlessness emergency set . Nebulised bronchodilator therapy mainstay treatment , describe National Institute Clinical Excellence guideline . Delivery bronchodilator ( salbutamol ipratropium ) standard facemask - Trust Phillips Respironic© mask . Drugs delivery variable nebuliser mask difficult measure exactly much drug deliver distal bronchial tree . Furthermore , highly variable patient depend well mask fit patient tolerance , amongst factor . Various attempt make improve drug delivery acute set spacer hood ( within paediatric asthmatic patient ) , . However , show clinical outcome regardless method delivery . Clinical assessment base combination objective subjective parameter . Within Emergency Department , include patient clinician perception improvement symptom ( primarily shortness breath ) . Assessment also include objective measurement oxygen saturation , arterial blood gas measurement end tidal CO2 measurement available . There many challenge face specifically within Emergency Department patient COPD . As see patient soon enter hospital , initial therapy may already administer ambulance service assessment slightly bias patient may initially appear well actually . Furthermore , often burden Emergency Departments busy period winter , mean always possible give patient instant treatment see immediately doctor , particularly unwell patient base triage system . In addition , objective measure use previous trial bedside spirometry practical Emergency Department several reason . Firstly , patient acutely short breath able perform spirometry properly . Secondly , something do routinely Emergency Department , doctor nurse may properly train carry may obtain falsely high low result . The Aerogen Aeroneb Solo© new nebuliser hypothesise increase drug delivery peripheral bronchus . Previous study show delivers 4 time drug jet nebuliser 3 time much meter dose inhaler . However , first study adapter human subject first study specifically COPD .</detailed_description>
