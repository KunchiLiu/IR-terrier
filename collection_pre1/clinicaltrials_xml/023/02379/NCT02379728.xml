	<brief_summary>Every day Ghana , 47 baby stillborn ( SB ) 232 baby bear low birth-weight ( LBW ) - many die infancy suffer lifelong consequence . Sleeping back pregnancy recently emerge scientific literature potential risk factor SB LBW . In fact , one early study demonstrate link conduct Ghana investigator protocol . When woman mid-to-late-pregnancy lie back , large uterus compress one major vein delivers blood back heart may completely obstruct . This may result less blood return heart less blood pump develop fetus . Such change may negatively impact growth fetus , along risk factor , may contribute death baby . The investigator develop device , 'PrenaBelt ' , significantly reduce amount time pregnant woman spend sleep back . The PrenaBelt function via simple , safe , effective , well-established modality call positional therapy . The purpose study determine effect PrenaBelt birth-weight ass feasibility introduce Ghanaian third-trimester pregnant woman home set via antenatal care clinic local health-care staff . Data study use effect size calculation design large-scale , epidemiological study target reduce LBW SB Ghana globally .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : According WHO , stillbirth ( SB ) define fetal death gestation ≥28 week weight ≥1000g . In addition loss life stillborn baby , parent whose baby stillborn must cope psychological grief lose baby , result markedly increase mortality bereave parent compare non-bereaved parent . Low birth-weight ( LBW ) define weight le 2500g birth . LBW significant contributor SB , infants LBW 20 time likely die first year heavier baby . Although LBW baby constitute 15 % live birth , account 60-80 % neonatal death . Neonatal death ( death within first year life ) account 40 % deaths age five year . LBW also account significant morbidity cognitive impairment , chronic disease later life . LBW arise short gestation ( preterm birth ) in-utero growth restriction , . Women Ghana suffer one high perinatal mortality rate world . Every day Ghana , 47 baby stillborn 232 baby bear LBW - many die infancy suffer lifelong consequence . As , Ghana urgently require inexpensive intervention reduce perinatal morbidity mortality - assist pregnant Ghanaian woman avoid sleep back might one intervention . Background - Maternal Position : In obstetrics , well-known pregnant woman assume supine position ( lay back ) day , maternal cardiovascular parameter and/or fetal oxygenation alter , occasionally cause significant fetal heart rate change , particularly labor . However , recently , little evidence effect supine position sleep pregnancy . Recently , three study suggest maternal sleep position may risk factor SB LBW . This significant give majority third trimester pregnant woman spend 25 % sleep time supine . In Auckland Stillbirth Study , population attributable risk ( PAR ) non-left sleep position SB find 37 % , great PARs three important modifiable risk factor SB ( obesity , advance maternal age , smoke ) combine . In African population , investigator protocol find supine sleep pregnancy independent predictor LBW ( OR , 5.0 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.2-20.2 ; P=0.025 ) SB ( OR , 8.0 ; 95 % CI , 1.5-43.2 ; P=0.016 ) , control covariates maternal age , gestational age , parity , presence pre-eclampsia . Notably , LBW find mediate relationship supine sleep SB . Currently , much interest follow research occur worldwide , grow body evidence regard detrimental effect supine sleep position pregnancy outcomes . One propose model maternal supine position sleep stressor play causative role LBW SB via compression abdominal aorta inferior vena cava ( 'aortocaval compression ' ) , result negative sequela . The investigator hypothesize mitigate stressor , may protect fetus LBW SB . Background - Maternal Device : Given emerge data suggest supine sleep may play role LBW SB high perinatal mortality rate Ghana , simple intervention may allow investigator improve fetal outcome . Some pregnant woman sleep many pillow support body , include pillow behind back avoid supine position . Asking woman sleep leave increase percentage leave sided sleep approximately 60 % night ; however , may come cost slightly reduce sleep duration , perhaps due woman feel need make conscious effort maintain certain sleep position . Hence , simple , low-cost , easily-implemented device develop use pregnant woman mitigate risk factor . The investigator anticipate use device remove need woman make conscious effort avoid supine sleep position . The device name 'PrenaBelt ' . The PrenaBelt currently prototype stage development , , proposal proof-of-concept/feasibility project . The PrenaBelt belt-like , positional therapy device design specifically pregnant woman . While PrenaBelt prevent user lie back sleep , expect significantly decrease amount time spend position via mechanism positional therapy . Positional therapy simple , non-invasive , inexpensive , long-established , safe , effective intervention prevent people positional-dependent snore mild moderate obstructive sleep apnea sleep back - position exacerbate condition . The PrenaBelt worn level waist . By virtue design position user 's body , PrenaBelt affect subtle pressure point back user lie back . These subtle pressure point activate body 's natural mechanism spontaneously reposition relieve discomfort , thereby reduce amount time remain back sleep . The PrenaBelt also design adjustability comfort . The investigator design electronic Body Position Sensor ( BPS ) securely integrated pocket PrenaBelt . The BPS record body position user ( leave , right , prone , supine ) . The BPS research purpose . Study Design : The feasibility ( technical , operational , cultural ) , efficacy , acceptability , compliance PrenaBelt intervention target population third trim pregnancy antenatal care clinic home setting effect PrenaBelt treatment birth weight evaluate via sham-controlled , double-blind , randomize control trial . Preliminary data collect design future , large-scale , parallel-group , randomize control trial determine efficacy PrenaBelt intervention improve pregnancy outcomes resource-limited setting . A small cohort participant treatment control group randomly select use BPS 's throughout third trim pregnancy . Each BPS participant treatment group match BPS participant control group use BMI ( normal , overweight , obese ) age ( within 5 year ; 2.5 year side ) match variable BPS data compare . These data serve preliminary objective evidence PrenaBelt usage effect maternal sleeping position third trim pregnancy target population set . Potential Harms : This study minimal risk . Participants study great risk harm complete activity study risk encounter everyday life . The PrenaBelt , sham-PrenaBelt , Body Position Sensor device non-invasive medical device Health Canada Class I designation . Pregnant woman typically sleep many pillow support body , include pillow behind back avoid supine position . The PrenaBelt positional therapy device may assist pregnant woman avoid supine sleep . Positional therapy device show safe approve use human US Food Drug Administration . In addition , maternal body pillow , regular pillow , pelvic belt ( lumbar support ) use pregnant woman sleep without report serious adverse effect mother neonate [ Victoria Pennick Sarah D Liddle , `` Interventions prevent treat pelvic back pain pregnancy ( Review ) , '' The Cochrane Collaboration , London , Review 2013 ] . Participants intervention control group may experience discomfort learn sleep PrenaBelt/sham-PrenaBelt , theoretically may lead delayed onset sleep , arousal sleep , loss sleep . Participants instruct , tell , remove PrenaBelt/sham-PrenaBelt discontinue use time without penalty become uncomfortable .</detailed_description>
