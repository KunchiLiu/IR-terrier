	<detailed_description>Virtual reality exposure therapy ( VRE ) treatment anxiety disorder receive considerable attention . During VRE , person encounter fear stimulus computer-generated environment , often use head mount display motion tracker allow multisensory input natural movement . Several advantage VRE note - clinical , treatment acceptability , methodological , ability conduct exposure tightly control environment . Empirical support VRE varies across anxiety disorder . Specifically , randomize control trial support efficacy VRE fear fly acrophobia show equally effective vivo exposure . These phobias lend well VRE ; fear stimulus circumscribed contains powerful physical cue produce within virtual environment . There less control research use VRE anxiety disorder . The current study examines VRE social anxiety disorder , characterize fear negative evaluation , thus may difficult evoke treat use virtual environment . Further , research date compare VRE gold standard treatment social anxiety disorder - cognitive behavioral therapy group format . The purpose current study compare VRE Exposure Group Therapy wait list sample adult meet criterion social anxiety disorder primary fear public speaking . It hypothesize , relative wait list , receive treatment improve standardized measure public speak fear fear negative evaluation , well behavioral avoidance task . Participants also expect maintain treatment gain 3 12-month follow-up . Comparisons two active treatment also make . Procedure Following consent , study candidate complete phone interview screen obvious exclusion criterion ( e.g. , current treatment social anxiety disorder ) in-person , pretreatment assessment consist Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV ( SCID ) , speech task , battery self-report measure . Eligible participant randomly assign virtual reality exposure therapy , exposure group therapy , wait list simple randomization use computerized random number generator . Concealment procedure use prevent foreknowledge treatment assignment influence enrollment . Each potential participant participant number , know study coordinator . The first author keep hard copy list link participant number condition assignment lock file drawer . Once participant enrol , study coordinator ask treatment condition particular participant number . The first author knowledge participant link participant number , study coordinator knowledge participant number link treatment condition . Participants assign wait list re-randomized virtual reality exposure therapy exposure group therapy follow wait period ( Figure 1 ) . Participants complete assessment treatment session psychology clinic within urban research university accessible public transportation . Assessments Participants complete assessment pretreatment , posttreatment , follow-up . Self-report outcome measure complete assessment point . Participants ask complete behavioral avoidance task pretreatment posttreatment . The anxiety , mood , substance use module SCID administer pretreatment , anxiety module administer 3-month follow-up . All assessment conduct doctoral student blind type treatment receive . All pretreatment follow-up diagnostic assessment videotape , randomly select subset ( N=10 ) review licensed psychologist calculate inter-rater reliability pretreatment assessment ( 100 % agreement primary diagnosis , one disagreement severity ) . Compensation provide participant complete self-report battery measure administer posttreatment , 3- 12-month follow-up . Treatment Prior administer therapy , study therapist attend two day train workshop treatment , lead developer respective treatment . Each study therapist also receive weekly supervision first author . There 5 study therapist : 2 license clinical psychologist experience manualized treatment , 3 doctoral student experience manualized treatment . All therapist administer treatment . Both treatment administer accord manualized protocol 8 session . The VRE EGT treatment group design similar possible , exception modality delivery exposure . Both treatment begin treatment rationale psychoeducation social anxiety disorder . During session 2- 8 , treatment address specific aspect social anxiety disorder identify psychopathology literature , include self-focused attention , perception self others , perception emotional control , rumination , realistic goal set social situation use technique cognitive preparation , challenge cost probability bias . Session 8 also include relapse prevention . Homework assign treatment , include daily mirror task , daily record social situation , identification cognitive bias . Virtual Reality Exposure ( VRE ) Virtual environment include virtual conference room ( ~5 audience member ) , virtual classroom ( ~35 audience member ) , virtual auditorium ( 100+ audience member ) . Therapists could manipulate audience reaction number way include make appear interested , bore , supportive , hostile , distract ( i.e. , cell phone ringing ) . Virtual audience member could also pose question , either standardize ( e.g. , `` I n't understand , could explain '' ) tailor client use therapist voice-over . Virtual environment manipulate accord participant fear hierarchy . Participants expose item hierarchy fear decrease . Exposure Group Therapy ( EGT ) EGT co-led license clinical psychologist advance doctoral student . Groups consist five participant . During exposure , participant give videotape speech front group . Group member also ask provide positive feedback videotape speech review . Every effort make equate time exposure across treatment group . Participants receive VRE complete 4 trial exposure . Because risk simulator sickness ( e.g. , headache , nausea ) , exposure trial last longer 30 minute , total 120 minute . Participants receive EGT receive 6 trial exposure . The amount time spend group member vary accord number participant group . On average , group 4 participant , participant complete 6 trial exposure 20 minute total 120 minute . Wait List After 8 week , wait list participant complete self-report battery . Wait list participant re-randomized either virtual reality exposure exposure group therapy follow wait period receive 8-week treatment protocol describe .</detailed_description>
