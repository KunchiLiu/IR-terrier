	<criteria>General 1 . Subject ≥ 18 year age time consent 2 . Subject experience clinical symptom consider suggestive ischemic heart disease ( e.g. , chest pain discomfort , heart failure , etc . ) evidence myocardial ischemia ( e.g. , abnormal functional study ) attribute CTO target vessel schedule clinically indicate percutaneous revascularization 3 . Subject eligible consent undergo PCI procedure 4 . Subject acceptable candidate percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) , stenting , emergency coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) 5 . Subject willing able sign Informed Consent Form approve local Institutional Review Board 6 . Female subject childbearing potential must negative qualitative quantitative pregnancy test within 7 day study procedure Angiographic 7 . A minimum one de novo lesion least one target segment native coronary vessel meeting definition chronic total occlusion . Nonstudy lesion treat first . A `` chronic total occlusion '' nonacute total coronary occlusion fulfil angiographic characteristic consistent highgrade native coronary stenosis ( TIMI 0 1 ) estimate duration least 3 month clinical history and/or comparison antecedent angiogram electrocardiogram . An attempt cross target lesion least one Asahi guidewire Corsair microcatheter must make . General 1 . Subjects history allergy iodinate contrast effectively manage medically 2 . Evidence acute MI within 72 hour intend treatment define cardiac enzymes great ULN . 3 . Previous coronary interventional procedure kind within 30 day prior procedure 4 . Any contraindication cardiac catheterization standard concomitant therapy use routine cardiac catheterization PCI ( e.g. , aspirin , clopidogrel , unfractionated heparin , etc . ) 5 . Target lesion require treatment device successful crossing PTCA prior stent placement 6 . Subjects know history clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding include : Neutropenia ( &lt; 1000 neutrophils/mm3 ) within previous 2 week Thrombocytopenia ( &lt; 100,000 platelets/mm3 ) AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase , bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × ULN Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL 7 . Subjects evidence ongoing active clinical instability include follow : Sustained systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mmHg cardiogenic shock Acute pulmonary edema severe congestive heart failure Suspected acute myocarditis , pericarditis , endocarditis , cardiac tamponade Suspected dissect aortic aneurysm Hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , restrictive cardiomyopathy , congenital heart disease 8 . History stroke transient ischemic attack within prior 6 month 9 . Active peptic ulcer upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding within prior 6 month 10 . History bleed diathesis coagulopathy refusal blood transfusion 11 . Subjects pathology cancer , mental illness , etc. , opinion Investigator , might put patient risk , preclude followup , way confound result study 12 . Known previous medical condition yielding expect survival less 1 year 13 . Subjects unable unwilling comply protocol expect complete study period , include followup requirement 14 . Currently participate investigational drug another device study complete primary endpoint clinically interfere current study endpoint ; require coronary angiography , intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) , coronary artery imaging procedure Angiographic 15 . Occlusion involve segment within previous stent 16 . Extensive lesionrelated thrombus ( TIMI thrombus grade 3 4 ) 17 . Previous stenting ( drugeluting bare metal ) target vessel unless follow condition meet : It least 9 month since previous stenting That target lesion least 15 mm away previously place stent The previously stented segment ( stent plus 5 mm either side ) 40 % diameter stenosis , base visual estimate 18 . The target vessel lesion proximal total occlusion identify great 75 % diameter stenosis base visual estimate . However , plan stenting lesion target vessel proximal target lesion cover single stent ( i.e. , tandem lesion ) acceptable .</criteria>
