	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To demonstrate superiority term radiographic Progression-Free Survival ( rPFS ) cabazitaxel versus either enzalutamide abiraterone plus prednisone patient metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer ( mCRPC ) disease progression receive AR target therapy ( abiraterone plus prednisone enzalutamide ) within 12 month treatment initiation ( ≤12 month ) . Secondary Objective : - To compare efficacy : - Prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate Time PSA progression ( TTPP ) . - Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) . - Overall Survival ( OS ) . - Tumor response rate duration tumor response . - Pain response time pain progression . - Symptomatic skeletal event ( SSE ) rate time occurrence SSE . - To analyze messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNAs ) include androgen-receptor splice variant 7 messenger RNA ( AR-V7 ) biomarker Circulating Tumor Cells ( CTCs ) . - To evaluate safety 2 treatment arm .</brief_summary>
