	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers want find good way treat cancer . One drug treat cancer paclitaxel . Sometimes proteins block drug work . Researchers want see another drug , nilotinib , help paclitaxel work well . Objective : - To test safety nilotinib plus paclitaxel find dose drug give safely people . Eligibility : - Adults least 18 year old advance cancer progress receive standard treatment , effective therapy exists . Design : - Participants screened test usually get cancer care : medical history , physical exam , blood urine test , heart test , scan . - Participants take two study drug 28-day cycle . They keep medicine diary . - Nilotinib take mouth twice every day except day 1 first cycle . - Paclitaxel give IV week first 3 week cycle . This usually do clinic . - Most participant weekly study visit every week cycle 1 , first 3 week cycle . They : - Physical exam every visit . - Blood test multiple time cycle 1 , first 3 week cycle . - Scans every 8 week . These may CT MRI scan , machine take picture . Or may ultrasound , wand press skin gel . - Around 30 day stop study drug , participant call discuss side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : -The BCR-Abl kinase inhibitor nilotinib demonstrate great additive activity combination anti-tubulin agent paclitaxel preclinical xenograft model , justify clinical evaluation combination antitumor activity Objectives : - To establish safety , tolerability , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) nilotinib plus paclitaxel patient refractory solid tumor - To determine pharmacokinetics paclitaxel administer combination nilotinib - To evaluate pharmacodynamic effect combination biomarkers apoptosis , DNA damage response , epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition Eligibility : - Study participant must histologically confirm solid tumor progress standard therapy know prolong survival standard treatment option exist - Age great equal 18 - No major surgery , radiation , chemotherapy within 3 week prior enter study ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) . - Adequate organ function Study Design : - This open-label Phase I trial - The start dose nilotinib administer 300 mg orally BID cycle 1 day 2 paclitaxel administer IV 60 mg/m2 dose level 1 Days 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle . For cycle 2 , nilotinib administer day 1 . Dose escalation follow 3+3 design , dose limit toxicity define cycle 1 . - Up 25 patient accrue PD expansion phase MTD ass pharmacodynamic endpoint tumor CTCs .</detailed_description>
