	<brief_title>Dose Finding Study Namilumab Combination With Methotrexate Participants With Moderate Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call namilumab . Namilumab test treat rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) people inadequate response methotrexate , people inadequate response tumor necrosis factor-inhibitor ( TNF-IR ) . This study look improvement disease activity participant take namilumab . The study enroll approximately 100 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance ) one four treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Namilumab 20 mg/mL subcutaneous injection - Namilumab 80 mg/mL subcutaneous injection - Namilumab 150 mg/mL subcutaneous injection - Placebo ( dummy inactive subcutaneous injection ) - medication look like study drug active ingredient . All participant receive namilumab placebo specify protocol . A stable dose methotrexate daily folic acid also require treatment . This multi-centre trial conduct worldwide . The overall time participate study 40 week . Participants make multiple visit clinic , include follow-up assessment 18 week last dose study medication .</detailed_description>
