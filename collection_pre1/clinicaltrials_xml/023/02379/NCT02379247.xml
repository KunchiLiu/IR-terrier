	<brief_title>BYL719 Nab-Paclitaxel Locally Recurrent Metastatic HER-2 Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common cancer second lead cause cancer relate death American woman . Despite recent improvement treatment breast cancer , 40,000 woman still die year US result breast cancer . Chemotherapy ( usually consist sequential single agent ) remain backbone treatment patient HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer . A majority patient show initial response treatment , eventually show disease progression . The purpose study determine high dose BYL719 combine Nab-Paclitaxel result serious side effect . The safety effectiveness BYL719 combine Nab-Paclitaxel treat patient HER-2 negative breast cancer assess , along determination long drug combination keep disease get bad . The study do two part : Part 1 determine high dose BYL719 safe tolerable take combination Nab-Paclitaxel . Part 1 complete Part 2 begin . Part 2 investigate take BYL719 ( dose determine Part 1 ) + Nab-Paclitaxel safe effective patient HER-2 negative breast cancer .</detailed_description>
