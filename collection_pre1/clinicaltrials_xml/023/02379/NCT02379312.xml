Treatment equivalence , meet 90 % confidence interval ( CI ) between-treatment difference appetite AUC within range -5 +5 mm/min reference . Two normal energy foam slightly different composition also compare reference foam test possible effect difference composition ( carbohydrate type , emulsifier ) energy per se . On test day , volunteer arrive clinic fast state consume standardize 250 kcal breakfast . Subjects receive one four test product 2.5 hour start breakfast consume 400 ml test product spoon within 10 minute . Each subject randomize treatment order accord balance ( Williams type ) design , receive one four test product week 4 week , separate one-week washout period ( consumed week day ) .</detailed_description>
