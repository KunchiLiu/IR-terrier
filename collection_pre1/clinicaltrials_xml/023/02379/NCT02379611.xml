	<brief_summary>Hypothesis At 12 month age , neurologic development TVA non cochlear implant profound congenital deaf infant would different development normally hear infant . At 24 month age , neurologic development TVA deaf infant implant age 18 month would similar development normally hear infant . Main aim The main aim research study , mean functional near infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) , neurologic development TVA 24 month age ( +/- 1 month ) group ( n=40 ) normally hear infant group ( n=40 ) profound congenital deaf child implant age 18 month . Main outcome Measure localization increase brain blood flow auditory stimulation `` voice '' type compare stimulation `` non-voice '' type . Comparison result group 24 month age +/- 1 month allows analyse eventual difference . Secondary aim outcome To study mean functional near infrared spectroscopy neurologic development temporal voice area 12 month age ( +/- 1 month ) group normally hear infant group profound congenital deaf infant wear standard hearing device age 11 13 month receive cochlear implant 12 18 month age . To study association fNIRS data clinical data evaluation comprehension speak language 24 month age . Methods Two group 40 infant matching age constitute . Less 13 month old child include medical consultation ENT department Necker hospital complete information parent . Written consent parent require . An audiophonological checking do . Then fNIRS examination program maternity Robert Debr√© hospital do age 12 month ( +/- 1 month ) 24 month ( +/-1 month ) . This fNIRS examination measure modification brain blood flow listen human voice sound environmental sound .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Neurologic Development Temporal Voice Area ( TVA ) Deaf Infant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One two among thousand new-born require hearing device cochlear implantation age 4 year correct hearing loss . Without appropriate hearing stimulation , brain area , include temporal voice area ( TVA ) , remodel . But remodel process deleterious phenomenon case future cochlear implantation . Therefore seem crucial good understand impact hearing loss neurologic development TVA infant . Main aim outcome : Main aim research compare cortical activation TVA 24 month age ( +/- 1 month ) , mean measure hemoglobin and/or desoxyhemoglobin concentration TVA listen human voice sound compare non-voice sound ( environmental sound ) ( fNIRS method ) : - normally hear infant - profound congenital deaf infant receive standard auditory device age 10 month implant 12 18 month age . Comparison result two group 24 month +/- 1 month allow evaluate impact hear loss rehabilitation mean standard hear device cochlear implant neurologic development TVA infant . Main outcome record difference measure hemoglobin and/or desoxyhemoglobin concentration listen human voice sound compare environmental sound TVA , group infant 24 month old ( +/- 1 month ) . A difference localization activation `` deaf '' group would suggest modification neuro-development TVA due hearing loss . On contrary , similar localization activate area would suggest `` pick '' neuro-development TVA due correction hearing loss mean auditory device . Secondary aim outcome Compare cortical activation TVA 12 month age ( +/- 1 month ) mean measure hemoglobin and/or desoxyhemoglobin concentration TVA listen human voice sound compare environmental sound : - normally hear infant - profound congenital deaf infant receive standard auditory device age 10 month implant 12 18 month age . Secondary outcome record difference measure hemoglobin / desoxyhemoglobin concentration TVA listen human voice sound compare environmental sound group infant 12 month age ( +/- 1 month ) . Comparison result two group 12 month +/- 1 month allow evaluate impact hear loss rehabilitation mean standard hear device cochlear implant neurologic development TVA infant . Comparison result obtain 12 month ( +/- 1 month ) 24 month ( +/- 1 month ) age group allow study neurological development TVA normally hear infant deaf infant wear auditory device period one year . Study association development oral communication , measure mean questionnaire evaluation communication development comprehension oral language infant , activation TVA 24 month age mean fNIRS .</detailed_description>
