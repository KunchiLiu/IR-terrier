	<brief_title>Cooperation Improved Pharmacotherapy Home-dwelling Elderly People Receiving Polypharmacy - The COOP Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 24 week cluster randomize , single-blinded , controlled trial . Family physicians invited participate project patient list , participate 1-5 patient . The investigator carry cluster randomization physician level instead individual randomization patient level . The investigator suppose comprehensive clinical evaluation drug review test , relevant patient relatively pronounced polypharmacy . It previously show conventionally use limit polypharmacy , e.g . five drug use regularly , identifies many patient without particular complex health state without drug relate problem . The investigator therefore limit project patient use seven regular drug , order increase likelihood may benefit drug review . A major challenge study complex intervention describe intervention sufficient precision facilitate replication . Our main strategy compensate necessary degree pragmatism interventional approach detailed description intervention fact carry , particular change drug regimens individual patient . The intervention consist three main part : 1 . Geriatric assessment : The patient see physician trained geriatric medicine . The physician carry medical history physical examination , relevant blood analysis supplementary test order already available . The geriatric work-up aim evaluate whether current medication indicate , whether relevant condition satisfactorily compensate , whether dosage appropriate , whether patient symptom may reality adverse drug effect , whether drug-drug interaction drug-disease interaction likely occur . Published tool like START ( Screening Tool Older Persons ' Prescriptions ) criterion , Screening Tool Alert doctor Right Treatment ( STOPP ) criteria The Norwegian General Practice ( NORGEP ) criterion use . 2 . Conference common drug review : The main purpose conference combine competence geriatrician family physician focus drug review . The two physician discuss patient 's drug list systematically . The geriatrician may suggest change drug regimen , family physician retain medical responsibility patient charge ordination medication change . 3 . Clinical follow-up : Depending medication change do , two physician arrange necessary follow-up within project period . The investigator assess outcomes 16 24 week , count baseline , also assess baseline value outcomes order adjust potential inequality .</detailed_description>
