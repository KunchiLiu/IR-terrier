	<detailed_description>Significance : Diabetes prevalent result major morbidity . Care patient diabetes complex often occur context chronic illness ; multimorbidity negatively impact morbidity mortality . The Canadian Diabetes Association ( CDA ) Clinical Practice Guidelines ( CPG ) rigorously develop knowledge tool comprehensively address aspect diabetes care , conform AGREE II standard guideline development . However , guideline adherence patient multimorbidity challenge provider patient , overwhelm numerous , often conflict recommendation . An individualized approach multimorbid diabetic patient use share decision-making ( SDM ) goal set may overcome challenge guideline adherence ; however strategies take extensively clinical practice . Barriers uptake overcome incorporating SDM context interprofessional care : diabetes care , role expansion , active participation one discipline add additional team member demonstrate improve clinical outcome . While SDM decision aid typically focus one issue , precedent potential exists use translation CDA CPG practice prioritization complex guideline recommendation . Given grow prevalence diabetes multimorbidity Canada , effectively bridge knowledge practice gap area potential significantly improve patient-important outcome , health care delivery system sustainability . Objectives : 1 . To enhance implementation complex guideline document ( CDA 2013 CPG ) assist prioritize care patient diabetes multiple comorbidities use diabetes-focused SDM intervention ; 2 . To systematically develop , test pilot SDM goal-setting intervention follow United Kingdom Medical Research Council Knowledge Action Frameworks ; 3 . To build team consist member research community , patient , health care provider , CDA , Local Health Integration Networks Ministry Health Long-Term Care , order increase relevance research conduct enable dissemination research result practice . Hypothesis An interprofessional SDM goal-setting tool kit , include 1-page provider enabler , point-of-care worksheet patient workbook , implement successfully clinical practice reduce decisional conflict diabetes distress improve chronic care delivery quality life patient type 1 type 2 diabetes 2 comorbid chronic disease . Research Plan Development , test refinement : An evidence-based multi-component SDM intervention develop , frame Interprofessional SDM Model base user input individual interview regard feasibility , acceptability mediator use . Usability test do use cognitive task analysis assess paths user take accomplish task , error make , encountered confusion frustration , degree satisfaction quality decision support . Based feedback receive , tool refine several iterative cycle feedback redesign . Pilot trial : The tool kit pilot two-step parallel cluster randomize control trial ( RCT ) whose primary purpose ass intervention fidelity test feasibility conduct large RCT . The first step provider-directed phase ; second step ( occur 6 month later ) provider- patient-directed phase . A secondary purpose study estimate impact decision aid decisional conflict ; secondary outcome include diabetes distress , chronic illness care quality life , assess patient-completed questionnaire validate scale baseline , 6 12 month . Analysis do intention treat . Multilevel hierarchical regression model use account clustered nature data .</detailed_description>
