	<brief_summary>The ultimate T1D treatment tool closed-loop glucose control system , i.e . fully automated system intensive insulin treatment . Such system ease burden constant treatment decision-making time potential safely intensify insulin therapy patient reach treatment goal . Currently , off-the-shelf closed-loop system exist research effort field intensify resulted great progress recent year . Most closed-loop system consist insulin pump , CGM , control algorithm reside mobile computer continuously ( every 5-15 min ) compute optimal insulin dosage CGM value . For daytime blood glucose control , however , believe system need advance . Consequently , extend single-hormone closed-loop system include second pump glucagon delivery correspondingly develop control algorithm compute insulin glucagon dosage . We hypothesize developed safe effective dual-hormone closed-loop system patient type 1 diabetes system superior single-hormone closed-loop therapy . The aims two-phase project 1 ) demonstrate proof-of-concept 2 ) compare dual-hormone single-hormone closed-loop glucose control .</brief_summary>
