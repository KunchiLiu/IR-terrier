	<brief_title>Study Short-term Fasting Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Patients With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All eligible patient fast 24 hour 24 hour administration chemotherapy consist doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide every 2 week four cycle follow paclitaxel every 2 week four cycle ( dose-dense AC + T ) For patient HER2 negative breast cancer , patient HER2 positive breast cancer : docetaxel ( T ) every 3 week four cycle . Trastuzumab ( H ) Pertuzumab ( P ) give concurrently docetaxel total 4 cycle surgery . For patient achieve pathological complete remission ( pCR ) , adjuvant chemotherapy doxorubicin ( A ) plus cyclophosphamide ( C ) every 3 week four cycle give , follow trastuzumab every 3 week complete 1 year treatment . For patient pCR , trastuzumab every 3 week give adjuvantly complete 1 year treatment ( TPH + AC ) .</detailed_description>
