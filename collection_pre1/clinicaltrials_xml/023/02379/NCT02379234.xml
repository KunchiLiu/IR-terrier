	<brief_summary>Continuous Veno-Veinous Hemofiltration ( CVVH ) frequently use renal replacement therapy intensive care unit patient acute renal failure . In theory , therapy continuous , 24 hours/day . However , wellknown actual duration CVVH session much low schedule , frequent `` circuit down-times '' ( 1 6 hours/day ) . There many reason premature end CVVH session ( i.e . catheter dysfunction , wrong setting , low anticoagulation… ) , early detection dysfunction may prevent ( least part ) CVVH circuit coagulation . ICU Nurses first line manage CVVH session , particularly case alarm . High-fidelity simulation recently propose health care provider education . It consistently associate large effect outcomes knowledge , skill , behavior moderate effect patient related outcome . Indeed , study assess impact simulation patient outcome follow complexe procedure , implies team work addition individual skill . In 12-bed surgical ICU , investigator decide implement CVVH technics ( addition dialysis already use ) . Before implement new technic ICU , investigator design study order ass wether high-fidelity base ICU-nurses education program would improve outcome CVVH session , compare conventional education program , propose CVVH manufacturer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simulation Continuous Veno-venous Hemofiltration Intensive caRe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All nurse 12-beds surgical ICU randomize one two arm CVVH training ( ie `` conventional '' , control arm , `` conventional + high-fidelity simulation '' , intervention arm ) . Randomization stratify accord nurse 's experience dialysis ( i.e . defined novice , standard expert ) . Then , CVVH session perform ICU , randomize supervise nurse one two arm . The nurse charge patient could thus change , depend his/her group ( note usual ratio 1 nurse 2.5 patient ) . Investigators use minimization algorithm randomization , take account presence shock , counter-indication heparin use , patient 's agitation , site dialysis catheter insertion ( ie . Internal jugular femoral ) previous early end session . Prescription CVVH standardize ( ie . Objective 35 ml/kg/h ultrafiltrate , 1/3 predilution 2/3 post-dilution ) , use unfractionated heparin . All CVVH parameter ( i.e . pressure , flow , alarms… ) record continuously , use computer . In addition , hemodynamic parameter biological parameter prospectively record every 3 hour . Prescription CVVH end timely write doctor . Nurses ask clearly record time CVVH session end . An end appear less 4 hour schedule arrest session consider `` prematurely end '' . Total effective duration session also record , well total volume ultrafiltrate .</detailed_description>
