	<detailed_description>Dr. Parker ( `` Investigator '' ) Semmes Murphey Foundation ( `` Foundation '' ) conduct study outcome safety associate degenerative disc Semmes-Murphey Clinic , P.C . ( `` Semmes-Murphey '' ) . This study look product derive human tissue , inject affected disc . With study , hope find safe effective way treat degenerative disc disease . This study compare injectable placental tissue extract call BioDGenesis ( `` Active Product '' ) injectable Normal Saline ( `` Placebo '' ) . The Active Product supply BioD , LLC ( `` BioD '' ) . You 50 percent chance receive Placebo The study last 52 week . After patient enrol study complete 26 week , Investigator conduct safety efficacy analysis . If investigator determines Active Product effective Placebo treat degenerative disc disease safety concern Active Product , patient receive Placebo option receive Active Product week 52 .</detailed_description>
