	<brief_summary>The topic spinal manipulation ( SM ) source increase research past decade . Research focus primarily upon functional clinical outcome associate SM . The physiological mechanism underlie clinical change experience follow SM still largely unknown . Current thought suggests SM may effect upon neurophysiological system , specifically autonomic nervous system . The purpose study explore effect SM upon autonomically regulate cardiovagal response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Mid-thoracic Manipulation Heart Rate Variability .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects ask report exercise room Mount St. Mary 's College physical therapy build one session last approximately 15-20 minute . The subject fill small questionnaire rule health condition , would exclude . The subject next inform method nature study ask sign inform consent form . Once sign , subject include study randomize either manipulative group , sham manipulation group control group . The Biocomm HRV Live ! heart rate variability monitor attach subject 's wrist ask lie supine treatment table five minute . The monitor compose simple record electrode secure wrist either tape band . At time principal investigator perform manual technique individual randomize manipulation group . The subject ask place his/her hand behind neck elbow align body . The principal investigator slightly roll subject 's torso towards place leave hand flexed position underneath subject 's spine T4-T5 level . The principal investigator flex subject 's thoracic spine place right forearm subject 's elbow ask subject slight crunch . Then principal investigator apply high velocity-low amplitude thrust anterior-posterior direction subject 's forearm leave hand subject . For sham manipulation group , force place elbow , aspect position manipulation group . The control group ask link finger behind neck rest one minute . Following intervention , subject ask lie quietly supine additional ten minute record post manipulation response .</detailed_description>
