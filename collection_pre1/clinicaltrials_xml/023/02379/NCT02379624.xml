	<brief_title>Pectin Start Early Enteral Nutritional Support Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastrointestinal function ( GI ) important determinant outcome critically ill patient , 62 % patient exhibit least one GI symptom least 1 day . Unlike upper gastrointestinal dysfunction , diagnose early abdominal distension , nausea , feed intolerance , acute low gastrointestinal dysfunction ( ALGID ) kind common complication easily neglect due atypical symptom . Once ALGID develop , critical patient could get enteral nutrition ( EN ) normally , early EN support often essential standard critically ill patient feasible . It also cause colonic bacteria reflux ileum jejunum , lead ischemic necrosis colon perforation , increase incidence various adverse event . Dietary fiber ( DF ) play important helpful role GI . It undergo partial total fermentation distal small bowel colon , lead production short chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) gas . It also help conduct slow delayed gastroenterology absorption , reduce luminal flow . To date , many research evidence exist DF-supplemented EN reduces incidence colonic dysfunction non-intensive care unit study . However , recently , still lack guideline conduct DF-supplemented EN rationally critically ill patient . Pectin , representative DF , gelatinous substance derive cell wall fruit plant contain galacturonan , consist mostly long-chain D-galacturonic acid combine unit α-1,4 linkage . As kind soluble dietary fiber , pectin prove control glucose blood lipid . It slow rapid infusion liquid meal gut delay gastric emptying . Studies show 90 % ingested pectin find terminal ileum . In view former study data basis investigator ' clinical observation , investigator postulate early application sufficient amount pectin ahead EN , may promote ALGID recovery critically ill patient , exert effect . Investigators design prospective randomize control trial test whether EN feed without pectin start would safe advanced clinical outcome . Investigators speculate pectin start EN could nourish digestive tract critically ill patient , superior traditional EN feeding delivery early nutritional support .</detailed_description>
