	<brief_summary>ROTEM® sigma new thromboelastometric coagulation analysis system . The new system fully automate allow simple safe operation compare predecessor model ROTEM® delta . Method comparison ROTEM® sigma predecessor model ROTEM® delta ) - confirmation equality . Confirmation reference interval ROTEM® system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ROTEM® Sigma Performance Evaluation - Method Comparison With Predicate Device Reference Intervals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main innovation ROTEM® sigma development sample handler cartridge allow full automated test operation . As ROTEM® delta four different test run simultaneously four channel analyser . Whereas test ROTEM® delta perform manually pipetting blood sample liquid system reagent , ROTEM® sigma reagent contain freeze dried pellet form cartridge . Test operation perform insert cartridge attach blood sample analyser . The five available ROTEM® test INTEM , EXTEM , FIBTEM , APTEM , HEPTEM contain different combination two cartridge configuration : - Cartridge type 1 include INTEM , EXTEM , FIBTEM , APTEM - Cartridge type 2 include INTEM , EXTEM , FIBTEM , HEPTEM Aim study performance evaluation new ROTEM® sigma coagulation analyzer comparison current ROTEM® delta thromboelastometry system . As valid method comparison require test result cover whole measurement range test system also necessary include acute bleeding emergency patient study . Only inclusion acute bleed emergency patient produce strong pathologic test result allow valid evaluation test system .</detailed_description>
