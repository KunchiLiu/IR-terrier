	<brief_summary>This study evaluate addition high-protein energy-restricted diet exercise treatment sarcopenic obesity people age 65 . Half participant follow hypocaloric ( 500 kcal deficit ) high-protein ( 1.2 -1.5 g Protein/ kg bodyweight ) diet alongside exercise regime , half follow exercise regime alongside habitual diet .

	<detailed_description>Sarcopenic Obesity associate advanced ageing characterise increase adipose tissue loss muscle mass , strength and/or function . The combination sarcopenia obesity predispose old individual functional disability either two condition alone , lead eventually increase rate morbidity mortality . Lifestyle intervention focus physical activity diet suggest effective tackling strategy . However , limited evidence efficacy intervention sarcopenic obese individual 65 year age . Therefore , aim study assess impact high protein energy-restriction diet mixed exercise program body composition , strength , functionality quality life old people sarcopenic obesity . This prospective randomise control trial among independent live sarcopenic obese community-dwellers . Eligible participant people 65y experience increase adiposity ( % body fat &gt; 28 % men &gt; 40 % woman ) low skeletal muscle index ( SMI &lt; 10.75 kg/m2 men &lt; 6.75kg/m2 woman ) . Fifty ( 50 ) participant randomly allocate either exercise group ( EX ) exercise plus high protein energy-restricted diet group ( EXD ) . Each group undergo 3 exercise sessions/ week period 16 week . The exercise session similar group incorporate aerobic , resistance , balance flexibility element . The EXD group receive 500kcal-deficit diet plan milk-based protein supplement ( ProMilk 50 Myprotein ; 50 g milk protein/ 500 ml bottle ) consume every day ( post-workout exercise day pre-bed snack non-exercising day ) . The protein consumption range 1.2-1.5 g.kg bw-1 . A total weekly dose 75mcg Vitamin D3 ( 3 x 25mcg ) administer orally participant avoid potential confounders associate Vitamin D deficiency/hypovitaminosis . The primary secondary outcome evaluate baseline , week 10 week 16 .</detailed_description>
