	<brief_summary>Background : Urothelial cancer cancer bladder , ureter , urethra . Researchers want good understand change person cell gene cause cancer form . This may help find new way treat . Objective : - To perform DNA sequence help researcher learn difference normal tissue tumor tissue . Also , learn molecular change - include gene change - might help predict course disease people respond therapy . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 older suspect urothelial cancer inherit disorder raise risk get bladder cancer . Design : - Participants screen physical exam . Their medical record tissue sample review . - Eligible participant give tissue block original tumor . The block put tissue bank . - Participants medical record may review . - Participants may medical history physical exam . - Participants may blood urine test . They may image scan . They may give urine , blood , saliva sample . These sample may use future research . - If participant need surgery cancer , researcher keep tissue ( tumor normal tissue ) . The tissue may use future research . - Participants go back Clinical Center 6 month . They may give saliva , urine , blood sample . After 6 month , see local doctor standard post-surgical visit . - Participants call every 6 month give health update .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Urothelial carcinoma , present low upper urinary tract disease , expensive malignancy treat diagnosis death , major advance drug therapy take place last two decade . - Understanding molecular mechanism genomic alteration cause urothelial carcinoma provide foundation development novel target therapeutic agent disease . Since 1982 investigator Urologic Oncology Branch study genetic basis urologic cancer . The identification gene cancer kidney lead approval FDA number new agent patient advanced disease . Similarly , goal study cancer biology ( genomic , molecular , cellular biology ) urothelial carcinoma order develop novel treatment strategy . - Collection patient tumor sample allow u study molecular biologic pathway develop novel target therapy . Correlation sample clinical outcome patient allow u predict understand clinical outcome possibly develop predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers . - Collection blood , urine saliva healthy volunteer allow u distinguish normal inflammatory condition malignant disease . Furthermore , specimen provide appropriate control comparison . Objective ( Primary ) : - Collect blood , urine , benign malignant tissue patient know suspected urothelial cancer purpose elucidate molecular mechanism carcinogenesis urothelial cancer ultimately , identify novel therapeutic target . - Collect blood , urine saliva healthy volunteer purpose establish control comparison urothelial cancer specimen . Eligibility : - Adults biopsy-proven suspect urothelial cancer require diagnostic therapeutic intervention part diagnosis , standard care treatment , followup/surveillance neoplasm . - Healthy volunteer blood , saliva urine sample easily obtainable . Design : - Care patient urothelial carcinoma provide per medically indicated standard process , normal malignant urothelial cancer tissue may obtain time clinically indicate diagnostic and/or therapeutic intervention . - Blood , urine , saliva sample research may obtain patient healthy volunteer baseline . Additionally , blood urine may collect patient follow-up interval . - No investigational experimental therapy give part protocol .</detailed_description>
