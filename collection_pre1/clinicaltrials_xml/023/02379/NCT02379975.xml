	<detailed_description>This longitudinal study approve Research Committee Santos Metropolitan University , individual access term consent . A total 56 individual rheumatoid arthritis assess , investigator select 12 woman mean age 45.38 diagnose rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) also mild chronic periodontitis ( PD ) . All patient refer outpatient specialty medical service rheumatologist 's specialty outpatient clinic Metropolitan University Santos diagnose evaluated individual test group control group . The control group compose individual initiated periodontal treatment , systemic involvement , probe depth compatible individual test group . The criterion participation study include dental procedure perform last six month , use antibiotic medication last six month , except use drug could alter salivary flow ( antidepressant , anxiolytic , antihistamine , diuretic among others ) , smoke , wear brace . The main parameter diagnosis RA include count number painful joint number swollen joint , inflammatory activity ( ESR PCR ) , assessment pain intensity , assessment joint mobility functional capacity . Before start periodontal treatment , test perform , blood test ( ESR PCR ) request evaluated rheumatologist charge . The healthy subject ( control group ) also underwent blood test . Upon completion amamneses , periodontal clinical examination perform previously train calibrated periodontist , sample study , 10 % examine twice clinical criterion order obtain intra-examiner reliability measure Kappa statistic ( 0.87 ) . The investigator observe clinical parameter periodontal probe depth ( PD ) six point per tooth , plaque index ( PI ) gingival index ( GI ) , conduct dichotomously cheek , buccal , mesial , distal lingual/ palatal . All participant receive radiographic , periapical , dental examination order check height level cortical bone . Subjects received oral hygiene device underwent therapy full mouth disinfection , patient follow protocol hold two session interval less 24 hour session . At begin session , oral hygiene instruction give subject individually investigator try teach patient correct way use brush floss . The treatment perform scrap single periodontist blind participant data obtain clinical trial . Each participant receive seven dos individually-based mouthwash chlorhexidine 0.12 % , use within seven calendar day execution first session propose therapy , patient tell always use brush last thing night wait 30 minute receive maximum effectiveness chlorhexidine . After procedure dental scale root planing , 90 day pass reassessment new periodontal clinical laboratory ( ESR PCR ) test perform . Then participant refer clinic operate college Dentistry UNIMES need . After tabulate clinical laboratory data participant include study , data subject statistical analysis . For , investigator use software SPSS 13.0 5.0 bioestat . In analytical situation significance level 95 % adopt ( α ≤.05 ) . For cluster analytical interest , characteristic distribution sample test among select statistical test use statistical test ANOVA two factor ( factor `` health condition '' - healthy rheumatoid factor `` periodontal treatment '' - Immediate evaluation periodontal treatment ) Tukey 's test .</detailed_description>
