	<brief_summary>Subjects type cancer associate infection virus call human papilloma virus ( HPV ) . The cancer come back , go away standard treatment subject receive standard treatment . This research study use special immune system cell call HPVST cell , new experimental treatment . Investigators want find use type treatment patient HPV-cancers . They discover way grow large number HPV-specific T cell blood patient HPV-cancers . They want see special white blood cell , call HPVST cell , train kill HPV infected cell survive blood affect tumor . They also see make T cell active HPV-cancers engineering resistant TGF-beta chemical HPV-cancers produce . They grow HPVST cell patient 's blood . The purpose study find big dose HPVSTs safe , see long last body , learn side effect see HPVSTs help people HPV associate cancer . If treatment HPVST cell alone prove safe ( Group A ) , additional group patient ( Group B ) receive Nivolumab addition HPVST cell lymphodepleted environment . Nivolumab antibody therapy help T cell control tumor FDA approve treatment certain type cancer , include Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Lymphodepletion decrease level circulate T cell prior infusion HPVST cell , thereby give room expand . The purpose part study find TGF-beta resistant HPVST cell combination Nivolumab safe , long last body effective HPVST cell alone control tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HPV find cancer cell half patient certain type cancer , suggest may play role cause cancer . The virus make protein tumor cell allow diseased cell recognize kill part body 's immune system call T cell . Unfortunately , tumor able avoid kill make molecule turn T cell . So , cancer cell infect HPV able hide body 's immune system escape destruction . The investigator previously study cancer cause different virus , call Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) . These EBV-cancers like HPV-cancers , since turn T cell would otherwise destroy , keep grow . They investigators find , however , remove T cell blood patient EBV-cancers grow outside body , could increase number activity T cell direct tumor . When T cell give back patient , T cell eliminate cancer half recipient . Investigators also find could engineer T cell even active EBV-cancer cell make resist inhibitory chemical call TGF-beta , produce cancer cell . Investigators collect 240 mL blood . Then use blood grow T cell . First grow special type cell call dendritic cell , stimulate T cell . These dendritic cell load bit protein HPV virus call E6 E7 . These dendritic cell use stimulate T cell . This stimulation train T cell kill cell HPV proteins E6 E7 surface . Next , investigator grow HPV-specific T cell stimulation dendritic cell HPV protein , , need , special type cell call K562 . These K562 cell treat radiation grow . To make T cell resistant TGF-beta release tumor , investigator put new gene laboratory call mutant TGF-beta receptor . In cell new gene , TGF-beta release tumor cell able bind mutant TGF-beta receptor T cell . Investigators hope improve chance T cell inject able keep work kill tumor cell . This gene add cell use mouse retrovirus change stop causing infection . Retroviruses enter cell 's DNA ( genetic material ) make permanent change cell . After make cell , frozen . For treatment , cell thaw injected vein 5 10 minute . Initially , one dose T cell give ( consider day 0 ) . If , 1st infusion , reduction size subject 's cancer ( increase ) CT MRI scan assess radiologist , subject receive additional dos would his/her benefit , s/he would like receive dos , enough product remain give additional injection ( low dose ) . If treatment HPVST cell alone prove safe , additional group patient ( Group B ) receive HPVST cell nivolumab lymphodepleted environment . One dose drug nivolumab give one day HPVST cell infused ( day 0 ) every 2 week total four dos nivolumab . Lymphodepletion give daily start day -4 prior administration HPVSTs . This dose escalation study . The dose patient get depend many participant get agent beforehand react . Investigators follow patient injection predetermine time point may require blood draws examination .</detailed_description>
