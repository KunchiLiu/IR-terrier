	<brief_title>Effects ECT Monoamine Oxidase A Depression Investigated With PET</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In treatment-resistant depression , electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) show effectively reduce depressive symptom ; however , underlie neurobiological mechanism remain fully understood . Recent neuroimaging finding underline involvement serotonergic system mechanism action ECT , study context mainly focused serotonin receptor serotonin transporter . Here , aim study assess effect ECT monoamine oxidase A ( MAO-A ) , main serotonin degrade enzyme know involved antidepressant action , human use positron emission tomography ( PET ) radiotracer [ 11C ] harmine . Moreover , antidepressant effect electroconvulsive stimulation show partly mediate via change neuroplasticity , secondary aim present study assess structural alteration cause ECT use magnetic resonance imaging ( sMRI ) . Based literature , investigator expect high baseline MAO-A distribution volume ( DVs ) depress patient compare healthy subjects.Moreover , investigator expect overall MAO-A distribution volume ( DVs ) change brain depressed patient follow ECT accord individual treatment-response . Similarly , investigator assume depressed patient exhibit structural change grey matter volume follow ECT . The investigation design longitudinal mono-centre study duration 36 month . 18 subject therapy-resistant , severe unipolar depression , age 18-60 year 18 age- sex-matched healthy subject include study . Patients recruit Department Psychiatry Psychotherapy , Medical University Vienna , offer inpatient care . Psychotropic medication ( except drug directly bind MAO-A , e.g . moclobemid ) patient allow steady state reach &gt; 10 day prior inclusion . Healthy subject recruit use announcement poster board General Hospital Vienna . Each patient measure three time use GE Advance PET scanner radioligand [ 11C ] harmine . The first second measurement determine baseline change MAO-A DVs third scan use quantify change induce ECT . Healthy subject measure PET . Similarly , patient undergo three structural ( T1-weighted ) MRI session temporally coordinate PET scan . Healthy subject measure MRI . Each patient treat 6 14 ECT session within time interval 2 5 week . A brief pulse ECT machine ( Thymatron System IVTM ) use three time per week administer treatment either unilaterally right hemisphere , require , bilaterally . The MAO-A DVs determine use region interest whole brain voxel-wise approach . A repeated-measures analysis variance ( ANOVA ) compare change MAO-A DVs ECT ( PET2-PET3 ) change baseline PET scan ( PET1-PET2 ) . Secondly , MAO-A DVs PET1 compare scan healthy subject ( cross-sectional part ) . Additionally , correlation treatment effect reflect HAM-D score change MAO-A DVs compute . Similar statistical analysis do sMRI data . This study would first demonstrate effect ECT MAO-A DVs human vivo . Given involvement MAO-A pathophysiology mood disorder , present study would important step towards well understand antidepressant treatment treatment response . By compare treatment effect underlie biological mechanism , study might help identify biomarkers distinguish patient likely benefit ECT patient rather non-responders . Finally , investigate role MAO-A DVs ECT , highly discuss relevance antidepressant action elucidate might prepare ground new therapeutic strategy . Additionally , study might contribute substantiate potential effect ECT brain structure .</detailed_description>
