	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study fluorine F 18 L-glutamate derivative BAY94-9392 ( 18F-FSPG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) image patient liver cancer undergo surgery transplant . Diagnostic procedure , 18F-FSPG PET , may help find diagnose liver cancer find far disease spread .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18F-FSPG PET Imaging Patients With Liver Cancer Before Undergoing Surgery Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate relationship 18F-FSPG PET/computed tomography ( CT ) pathology patient suspect hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) schedule liver resection surgery orthotopic liver transplant ( OLT ) . II . To compare 18F-FSPG PET/CT standard-of-care ( SOC ) diagnostic CT imaging patient suspect HCC schedule liver resection surgery OLT . III . To compare uptake 18F-FSPG PET/CT 11C-acetate PET/CT suspect HCC background liver patient schedule liver resection surgery OLT . IV . To evaluate uptake 18F-FSPG PET/CT non-HCC liver tumor : benign malignant compare background . OUTLINE : Patients undergo 18F-FSPG PET carbon-11 ( 11C ) -acetate PET scan within 4-8 week surgery OLT .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis HCC clinically document cirrhosis one following : Liver mass ( &gt; = 1 cm ) arterial phase contrast enhancement early washout subsequent phase CT ; Suggestive imaging finding plus alphafeto protein ( AFP ) &gt; 200 mg/dL ; Tumor confirm arteriography Diagnosis nonHCC liver mass one following : Liver mass ( ≥ 1 cm ) suggestive image finding benign liver mass ( adenoma , hemangioma , focal nodular hyperplasia ) . Liver mass ( ≥ 1 cm ) biopsy prove metastatic disease ( metastatic colorectal cancer , metastatic pancreatic cancer ) . Liver mass ( ≥ 1 cm ) nonHCC primary malignancy ( cholangiocarcinoma ) . Each patient must provide write informed consent complete conventional image stag CT ( multiphase ) MRI initiation investigational PET study Patients know prior malignancy receive systemic chemotherapy within five year , except basal cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma situ cervix , prior HCC , patient liver mass ( e ) proven metastatic disease exclude . Pregnant breastfeeding patient Patients poorly control diabetes mellitus ( fast blood glucose level &gt; 200 mg/dL ) Patients known infiltrative variant HCC</criteria>
