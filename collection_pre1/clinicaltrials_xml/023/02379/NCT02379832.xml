	<brief_summary>Preeclampsia may several cause lead different characteristic pathology . Differentiation `` type preeclampsia '' would help treat patient accurately . This project aim identify early marker specific type preeclampsia ( early late , without growth restriction ) . Through case-control study , many data collect prospectively ( serum marker , ultrasonographic marker , maternal factor ) among nulliparous woman sign preeclampsia ( soon first trimester ) nulliparous woman preeclampsia ( diagnosis ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-Eclampsia And Growth Restriction : Longitudinal Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The current definition preeclampsia base sign symptom without reference pathology . The majority preeclampsia case would come placental dysfunction begin early pregnancy , even onset clinical biochemical event lead diagnosis . Defects development placenta ( impaired transformation spiral artery ) would seem lead poor placental perfusion . Currently , uterine artery Doppler marker use predict placental perfusion routine monitoring pregnant woman . However , placental aspect , ultrasonographic measurement placental volume could also useful predict preeclampsia . Also , several study show many blood marker ( PAPP-A , PlGF , sFlt-1 ) detect soon first trimester seem effective predict majority early pre-eclampsia , occur 34 week gestation . However , predictive value marker strong regard prediction later preeclampsia , occur 34-37 week term . Other study show maternal factor , include value arterial pressure , BMI , maternal age , could contribute screen pre-eclampsia . Recent study also interested maternal ophthalmic artery Doppler try predict preeclampsia even development clinical symptom . Our hypothesis biomarkers may specific certain type pre-eclampsia ( early late ; without intra uterine growth restriction ) . We believe actual definition preeclampsia include heterogenous cause well understanding pathology would help practician offer individualised treatment patient . Objective : Our main goal characterize biophysical , biochemical , ultrasonographic placental perspective pathology preeclampsia . Method : This case-control study recruit : 1. nulliparous woman 1st trim pregnancy . They provide blood sample U/S examination 4 different time pregnancy . 2. nulliparous woman diagnosis preeclampsia . Data collect : maternal age maternal BMI maternal ethnicity maternal mean arterial pressure ( recruitment/diagnosis delivery ) gestational age recruitment/diagnosis delivery maternal serum PAPP-A , PlGF , endoglin , sFlt-1 ( recruitment delivery ) cord blood PlGf , endoglin , sFlt-1 fetal crown-rump length 1st trimester ( recruitment ) fetal growth ( pregnancy ) Uterine arteries Doppler Cord arteries Doppler Maternal Ophthalmic arteries Doppler Placental volume newborn birthweight</detailed_description>
