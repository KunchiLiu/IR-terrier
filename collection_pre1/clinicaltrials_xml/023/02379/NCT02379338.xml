	<brief_title>Study Radiotracer 18FFluortriopride ( 18FFTP ) PET/CT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>[ 18F ] FTP novel radioactive tracer show potential labeling dopamine D3 receptor PET/CT imaging . This phase 1 study design meant evaluate safety , biodistribution brain uptake [ 18F ] FTP healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Participants â‰¥ 18 year age 2 . `` Healthy volunteer '' define good general health opinion investigator ( control diabetes , control hypertension well control chronic medical condition may allow discretion investigator believe increase patient risk interfere collection image data , specific exclude condition describe exclusion criterion ) 3 . Participants must inform investigational nature study provide write informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline prior studyspecific procedure . 1 . Females pregnant time screen eligible study , urine blood pregnancy test perform woman childbearing potential screening . 2 . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &gt; 35 3 . Sustained uncontrolled hypertension ( Systolic blood pressure great 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure great 110 mm Hg ) screen intake session . If either pressure value state limit initial assessment , blood pressure may retested twice initial assessment five minute interval ( total 3 blood pressure assessment ) . The pressure elevation consider sustain either systolic diastolic pressure value outside state limit three assessment , subject exclude study participation . 4 . History epilepsy seizure disorder assess medical record review and/or selfreported 5 . History head trauma , opinion investigator may interfere uptake [ 18F ] FTP assess medical record review and/or selfreported 6 . History PostTraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia psychotic disorder assess medical record review and/or selfreported 7 . Use dopaminergic CNS stimulant ( prescription , overthe counter recreational drug ) within 30 day screen intake visit , assess review health history form concomitant medication review screen intake visit ( medical record and/or selfreported ) deem physician investigator potential influence bind [ 18F ] FTP 8 . Positive urine drug screen screen intake visit 9 . Selfreported current alcohol consumption exceed great 25 drink per week 10 . Any current medical condition , illness , disorder assess medical record review and/or selfreported consider physician investigator condition could compromise participant safety successful participation study 11 . Unwilling unable provide inform consent</criteria>
