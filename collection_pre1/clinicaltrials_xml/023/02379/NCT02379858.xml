	<brief_title>Gastrointestinal Tract Recovery Patients Undergoing Open Ventral Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : One common occurrence follow ventral incisional hernia repair post-operative ileus . Post-operative ileus source patient discomfort morbidity ultimately delay discharge hospital frequently source patient readmission . Prolonged length hospital stay due post-operative ileus increase direct health care cost , well indirect cost delay return workforce . The cause prolong ileus multifactorial , main culprit include intra-operative bowel manipulation , release endogenous opioids , administration exogenous opioid analgesic surgery post-operative pain control , inflammation , fluid shift . A study Lowe et al show follow ventral hernia repair , 27 % study patient prolong ileus , define last 7 day postoperatively . Likewise , mean hospital stay patient 12.5 day , due frequently , delay return bowel function . Ventral incisional hernia repair common operation post-operative ileus remain frequent costly post-operative occurrence currently effective therapy . Alvimopan proven successfully decrease duration post-operative ileus FDA approve use patient undergone bowel resection . Ultimately , decrease interlude operation return bowel function result shorter hospital stay , low hospital cost , fast rehabilitation . We propose study effectiveness Alvimopan decrease postoperative ileus time patient undergoing ventral hernia repair , cohort feel may benefit use Alvimopan date study . Recruitment Sample Size : A total 140 patient expect undergo research related treatment . The study contain one open surgery arm . The open surgery arm single-site prospective , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial 1:1 randomization study drug placebo 70 patient group total 140 patient study . An interim evaluation efficacy conduct separately open surgery arm half patient recruit . This study expect enroll 140 subject one academic medical center ( Froedtert Hospital Medical College Wisconsin ) site performs state art hernia repair high volume hernia practice . Treatment : Consented patient Treatment Group receive 12 milligram ( mg ) Alvimopan per-oral ( PO ) 30 90 minute prior ventral hernia repair pre-operative area continue 12 mg PO twice daily hospital discharge post-operative day ( POD ) 7 maximum 15 in-hospital dos ( Appendix II ) . The first post-operative dose begin Nasogastric Tube ( NGT ) removal . Patients Control Group receive 12 milligram ( mg ) Placebo orally ( PO ) 30 90 minute prior Ventral Hernia Repair ( VHR ) pre-operative area continue 12 mg PO twice day hospital discharge post-operative ( POD ) 7 maximum 15 in-hospital dos . The first post-operative dose begin NGT removal . Warnings precaution provide prescribe information packet US PI include : 1 . A high number myocardial infarction report patient treat alvimopan 0.5 mg twice daily compare placebo 12 12-month study patient treat opioids chronic pain , although causal relationship establish 2 . Patients recently expose opioids expect sensitive effect ENTEREG therefore may experience abdominal pain , nausea vomiting , diarrhea . 3 . Not recommended patient severe hepatic impairment . 4 . Not recommend patient end stage renal disease . 5 . Most common adverse reaction ( incidence &gt; =1.5 % ) occur high frequency placebo among ENTEREG-treated patient undergo surgery include bowel resection dyspepsia [ 2013 PI ] . 6 . Not recommended patient complete GI obstruction patient surgery correction complete bowel obstruction . 7 . Not recommended pancreatic gastric anastomosis .</detailed_description>
