	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy give surgery soft tissue sarcoma decrease size tumor mass presence malignant cell peripheral region . NBTXR3 radiation therapy may kill cancer cell increase tumor shrinkage render surgery feasible easy achieve good local control tumor . PURPOSE : This phase II/III prospective randomize , multi-center , open-label active control two arm study patient locally advance soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) extremity trunk wall . Patients randomize receive either NBTXR3 intratumor injection , activate external beam radiation therapy external beam radiation therapy alone , preoperative treatment . Once radiotherapy treatment complete , tumor surgery perform patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NBTXR3 Crystalline Nanoparticles Radiation Therapy Treating Randomized Patients Two Arms With Soft Tissue Sarcoma Extremity Trunk Wall</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients allocate arm A , receive single intratumor injection NBTXR3 receive external beam radiotherapy start 24hrs injection completion 5 week , 5 day week treatment ( 50Gy , 2Gy/fraction ) . Then , patient undergo surgical resection tumor 5 week later follow wound Healing toxicity assessment . A visit end treatment take place approximately 3-4 week surgery . Patients follow evaluation disease status adverse event end study .</detailed_description>
