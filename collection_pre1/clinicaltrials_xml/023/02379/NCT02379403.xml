	<brief_summary>Background : - Heart disease lead cause death disability United States . Diets high fruit vegetable may reduce risk heart disease . Fruits , include red tart cherry purple aroniaberries , may especially beneficial . Researchers want know tart cherry aroniaberry extract affect heart health . Objective : - To study benefit tart cherry aroniaberry extract vascular function measure . These include inflammation , oxidation , cholesterol . Eligibility : - Men post-menopausal woman age 55 70 good health normal slightly high blood pressure cholesterol . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , blood test . - Participants 6 visit . They blood take every visit . - Visit 1 : - Blood vessel test . Participants lie . Heart rhythm monitor . A device place upper arm , picture blood vessel take . - A blood pressure cuff tighten around low arm 5 minute . - Cardio-Ankle-Vascular Index ( CAVI ) . Blood pressure cuff place arm leg . They tighten air time minute . - Participants assign one three group . For 3 week , random order , take : aroniaberry capsule , tart cherry capsule , placebo capsule , capsule . - Participants answer question online eat exercise . - Participants keep record eat period . They come study visit every 3 week week 15 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Tart Cherry Aroniaberry Supplementation Endothelial Function Cardiovascular Measures Healthy Older Adults : Interactions With Genotype Proteome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) continue lead cause death disability worldwide . Cardiovascular disease age-related onset progression . The age process cause failure protective vascular mechanism lead pathophysiological change increase risk CVD . Heart healthy strategy include consumption diet rich fruit vegetable reduce risk prevent CVD . There grow experimental evidence certain fruit berry include , cherry aroniaberries , may cardioprotective due antioxidant vasodilatory property , beneficial modulation immune function inflammation . However , limited human study examine effect . In old adult , vascular age predominantly include increased arterial stiffness endothelial dysfunction . Oxidative stress inflammation also link age process . Therefore , study investigate effect tart cherry aroniaberry supplementation endothelial function ( flow-mediated brachial artery dilation ) arterial stiffness ( cardio-ankle vascular index ) indicator cardiovascular risk atherosclerosis . These measurement also provide assessment arterial structure function . Biomarkers endothelial dysfunction , inflammation , vascular injury , oxidation , lipid , well flavonoid phenolic acid profile also examine . Importantly , role genetics environmental interaction causal factor CVD completely understand . There also limit data plasma proteome change physiological process may result intervention diet nutrient . This study explore association response tart cherry aroniaberry supplementation single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) locus relate study outcome risk CVD . Moreover , association two supplement proteomic panel plasma proteins involve several physiological pathway CVD also investigate . In randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover clinical trial , 96 healthy old adult ( age 55-70 ) give tart cherry alternate aroniaberry supplementation daily 3 week usual diet . This study include initial screen visit follow 6 visit 3 week interval consist treatment , washout placebo period . This investigation provide important information role flavonoidrich nutrient effect arterial structure function . Relating genomic proteomic signature outcome study useful develop future therapeutic strategy low CVD risk .</detailed_description>
