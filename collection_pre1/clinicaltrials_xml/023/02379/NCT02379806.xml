	<brief_summary>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) frequent condition , affect 1.8 per 1,000 people every year . Admission hospital one main risk factor VTE , could account 20 % VTE , make VTE prevention admit patient appeal option reduce VTE global burden . The landmark MEDENOX trial others demonstrate efficacy low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) reduce composite outcome symptomatic asymptomatic event , latter accounting vast majority event . Publication trial lead implementation thromboprophylaxis policy hospital , acceptance variable . More recently , use thromboprophylaxis challenge publication 1 ) negative trial use 'death cause ' main outcome , 2 ) systematic review show lack clear efficacy risk pulmonary embolism death , 3 ) negative trial use new oral anticoagulant , 4 ) last version American College Chest Physicians Guidelines , focus symptomatic event , downgrade recommendation thromboprophylaxis medical patient 1B recommendation , restrict use patient 'at increase risk thrombosis ' recommend use thromboprophylaxis patient low risk thrombosis , patient bleed high risk bleeding . However , limitation interpretation data trial , patient screen asymptomatic event treat anticoagulant , prevent occurrence symptomatic event follow-up . Moreover , subgroup analysis show elderly patient high risk thrombosis trial , LMWH could particularly efficient subgroup patient . Conversely , risk bleeding also high young patient current trial power detect difference bleeding risk group . Finally , diagnostic therapeutic management VTE challenge elderly . Therefore , plan randomize control trial efficacy LMWH prevention symptomatic VTE elderly patient .</brief_summary>
