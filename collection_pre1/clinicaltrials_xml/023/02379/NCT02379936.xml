	<brief_summary>The immediate newborn period period high morbidity life . Early sign serious disease often vague difficult interpret non- specialist . Screening list clinical sign useful unsatisfactory specificity sensitivity , cover one two disease , complicate handle low resource setting . In critically ill newborn , organ failure one multiple organ system frequently see due inadequate circulation tissue . Critical disease cause hypoxia ischemia cell affect organ follow energy deficiency . Independently condition cause energy deficiency start series event , initially cause leak cell membrane lead intracellular component , i.e . enzyme Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , leak blood . Previous research newborn suggest LDH clinically interest early predictor serious illness may thus serve important complement clinical examination . If LDH level elevate health care personnel realize something wrong call appropriate measure . Today LDH analysis perform Dept . Clinical Chemistry inexpensive accurate method . However , method need relatively large blood volume delay blood sample result rather long , often several hour . In addition LDH sensitive hemolysis , quite common blood sample newborn . When detected laboratory new sample need , thus delay result even . Also , small health care facility rarely laboratory equipment need analysis LDH . The Swedish company Calmark Sweden AB launch point-of-care technology LDH analysis call `` Hilda Neo '' . LDH analyze easy-to-use consumable test card together `` App '' ordinary smartphone ( plan study , iPhone 4S ) . The result present within minute presence hemolysis simultaneously detected device . The investigator speculate use LDH test could serve diagnostic help health-care staff Vietnam make decision send potentially sick newborn high level neonatal unit ( case NICU NPH , Hanoi )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Lactate Dehydrogenase Decision Support Admissions Neonatal Ward</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Methods At admission NPH , newborn ( GA &gt; 32 w , â‰¤36h old ) infant refer NPH suspect probable clinical sign illness physician call considers blood sample need include study doctor take part study present ward . When blood test indicate , around 2 ml blood routinely draw include extra 0.1 ml blood analysis LDH use Hilda Neo card . When infant fulfil inclusion criterion physician duty open download `` App '' provide smartphone take photo first page study protocol include patient study number time birth , result clinical investigation simple clinical score protocol . Then physician press `` randomise button '' smartphone randomise use Hilda Neo card routine care . If randomise Hilda Neo card use `` app '' give instruction use card guide different step test . The result LDH test present physician immediately point-of-care used clinical decision . To prepare follow study usefulness LDH decide baby ready transfer NICU ordinary care include infant LDH test routine clinical laboratory daily blood sample draw . The investigator believe two LDH test 6 - 24 hour interval need question . The reason use two test interval high single LDH value expect large number infant precede disease decrease value might better predictor improve status . An evaluation protocol fill neonatologist ward 80-96h admission , early , discharge death . The classification protocols `` need '' `` need intensive care resource '' do independently two senior neonatologists , blind LDH result Hilda card routine clinical laboratory . The outcome report number patient admit correct level care , NICU level 2 unit , two group admit doctor access plasma LDH respectively . The definition correct correct admission level : 1 . Admitted NICU care : correct decision=The patient fulfil criterion referral NICU first 80 96h admission . 2 . Admitted NICU care : correct decision=The patient fulfil criterion referral NICU first 80 96h admission . 3 . Admitted level 2 unit : correct decision=The patient fulfil criterion referral NICU first 80 96h admission . 4 . Admitted level 2 unit : correct decision= The patient fulfil criterion referral NICU 80 96h admission The classification protocols `` fulfil fulfil criterion intensive care resource '' do independently two senior neonatologists , blind LDH result Hilda card routine clinical laboratory . The criterion `` fulfil criterion intensive care resource '' shock- , ventilator- , CPAP- treatment , blood exchange , parenteral nutrition procedure demand NICU capacity actual setting perform first 80 - 96 hour admission . For calculation number patient need study outcome `` right decision '' relation `` wrong decision '' use , see Power . The result record paper protocol form , keep clinical record patient . The result also keep photo use Smart phone App read picture send register . When picture come register identify study number . Name identity together study number take patient record separate register , securely keep one authorize person order future supplementary information . The data record study normally record NICU patient doctor evaluation Hilda card . The de-identified protocol save , process analysed statistical program SPSS . Only person involve study access data register . Based go ( Itzel et.al ) previously conduct research LDH activity exceed 600U/L consider increase . Power calculation In investigator earlier study 75 % baby admit NICU need intensive care procedure first week . To detect reduction 75 50 % accord outcome would need 58 patient test control group respectively . The control group group admit NICU ward ordinary care ward . If technical problem Hilda Neo test might influence primary outcome study include 58 baby problem solve . The background factor criteria need intensive care note presented protocol , ( n= 120+20 patient )</detailed_description>
