	<brief_summary>Patients severe chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) great risk infection due immune system suppress . Pneumococcal infection particularly common often result death due inflammation lung ( pneumonia ) whole body ( sepsis ) . This infection prevent use vaccine help build protective immunity . The currently recommended pneumococcal vaccine ( Pneumovax ) , however , often inefficient group patient . There thus urgent need improve exist vaccination policy . The goal research optimize pneumococcal vaccination patient severe CKD . Many patient suffer CKD already vaccinate Pneumovax . Because vaccine low immunogenicity immunocompromised individual , may still develop infection . A new vaccine , Prevnar13 , superior immunogenicity recently approve immunization . There , however , specific policy regard immunization adult CKD patient , furthermore unknown whether previous Pneumovax immunization negatively affect immune response Prevnar13 . In order test whether previous immunization Pneumovax affect immune response severe CKD patient Prevnar 13 , investigator immunize two group adult stage 4 5 CKD patient one dose Prevnar 13 ass initial immunological response , longevity , vaccine safety . The first group consist patient previously immunize Pneumovax , second group include participant history pneumococcal vaccination . Antibody level opsonophagocytic activity ( OPA ) quantify . The longevity immune response assess . As secondary objective , immune response analyze context demographic clinical characteristic vaccinate participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Previous Pneumococcal Immunization Immune Response Patients With Severe CKD Prevnar 13</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adult patient severe chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) immunocompromised know increased risk pneumococcal infection . To prevent infection , immunization pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPV23 ) currently recommend Canada ; however , vaccine effect patient suboptimal immune dysfunction . The second-generation pneumococcal vaccine ( polysaccharide-protein conjugate ) superior immunogenicity immunocompromised adult individual . In Canada , Prevnar 13 recently recommend NACI certain category immunocompromised adult , HSCT recipients HIV-positive patient . However , NACI conclude currently insufficient evidence recommend use Prevnar 13 patient chronic kidney disease . No publish data use pneumococcal conjugate vaccine adult CKD available . Moreover , unknown whether previous immunization PPV23 may negative effect immune response Prevnar 13 patient . Such possibility exists due memory B-cells ' depletion follow immunization pure polysaccharide antigen . In case , additional dos Prevnar 13 may require achieve optimal protection . The conjugate vaccine expand B-cell pool available respond subsequent antigen challenge . To test whether previous immunization PPV23 affect immune response severe CKD patient Prevnar 13 , immunize two group adult stage 4 5 CKD patient attend Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre one dose Prevnar 13 ass initial immunological response , longevity , vaccine safety . The first group consist patient immunize PPV23 one year prior enrollment study second group include patient without history pneumococcal vaccination . Fold increase antibody level OPA , well longevity immune response one-year period assess surrogate protection pneumococcal infection . The immune response analyze context demographic clinical characteristic vaccinate patient . All infectious episode study participant record throughout one year observation . We also record vaccine adverse effect follow immunization compare frequency severity two group . The anticipated result trial provide essential evidence justify use Prevnar 13 immunization adult CKD patient .</detailed_description>
