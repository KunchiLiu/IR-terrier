	<brief_summary>The propose project help understand change reinforcement impairment experience Roux en Y bariatric surgery ( RYGB ) patient consume alcohol . In study investigator propose investigate RYGB patient prospective , longitudinal design . Investigators examine drive impairment surgery well study cognitive change reinforcement change may occur RYGB patient consume alcohol . Finally , investigator aim good characterize change occur pharmacokinetics alcohol follow bariatric surgery examine key variable may play role development alcohol use disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alcohol Related Impairment Reinforcement : Pre Post Roux en Y Gastric Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The three major objective NIH sponsor application : 1 ) characterize severity cognitive impairment drive performance change follow alcohol consumption group patient undergone Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass ( RYGB ) bariatric surgery 2 ) investigate differential reinforce property alcohol patient undergo RYGB . Both objective stem observation investigator work previous empirical study suggest pharmacokinetics ( PK ) alcohol substantially alter follow bariatric surgery . This may lead alteration time-course severity alcohol-related cognitive driving impairment , well alter reinforce effect drink alcohol . Particularly relevant objective , PK data show higher peak alcohol concentration short time achieve bariatric surgery patient . Therefore third objective application well characterize PK profile alcohol follow RYGB . Finally , investigator explore whether change impairment , reinforcement , PKs moderate gender , age , smoking , alcohol use . In study investigator propose prospectively investigate approximately 50-60 RYGB patient . Participants assess baseline ( pre-surgery ) one year surgery ( approximate weight nadir ) acute alcohol dose laboratory paradigm .</detailed_description>
