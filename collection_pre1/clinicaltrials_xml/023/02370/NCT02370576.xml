	<brief_title>The Effect Traumatic Childbirth Incidence PTSD Other Major Postpartum Psychopathology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post- traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) - definitions The criterion diagnosis traumatic experience involve experience specific traumatic stressor , subsequently , four ax symptom : ( ) re-experiencing traumatic event , include nightmare , intrusive thought emotion ; ( ii ) avoidance stimulus associate traumatic event ; ( iii ) hyperarousal , express difficulty sleep concentrating , irritability , enhance startle response , irritable , aggressive , reckless self-destructive behavior ( iv ) persistent negative alteration cognition mood . Formal clinical diagnosis PTSD make symptom present least 1 month . The definition traumatic event include witness experience serious threat life bodily integrity , injury ( either physical emotional ) oneself others [ 1 ] . As , subjective objective experience give birth become recognize possibly traumatic event woman [ 2 ] . As result traumatic childbirth , woman may experience general distress , flashback , dissociation , amnesia , sleep disturbance , negative evaluation self-worth , difficulty breastfeeding , relationship problem problem sexuality [ 3-7 ] , problem bond infant [ 8-12 ] , significant fear subsequent childbirth ( tocophobia ) ; many choose conceive reason . The afflicted woman choose child may insist cesarean delivery hop traumatic [ 6 ] . PTSD childbirth- prevalence , risk factor , clinical characteristic long term implication About 2- 6 % woman experience full DSM-V criterion PTSD point give birth [ 13-14 ] . An additional 22- 40 % may meet criterion subsyndromal PTSD , another 20-50 % woman may report childbirth experience traumatic [ 13-14 ] . It known point characteristic woman may develop postpartum PTSD , make impossible predict prevent outcome . However , several risk factor recently elucidate . Several predisposing/prenatal factor associate childbirth experience associate PTSD . These include previous psychiatric history [ 15 , 16 , 17,18 ] ( especially depression pregnancy ) , socio-demographic problem [ 19,20 , 21 ] ( lack support , problematic relationship partner ) , parity ( primiparous risk ) , personality trait disorder [ 22 -24 ] ( trait anxiety ; anxiety sensitivity , neuroticism ) , previous trauma [ 25-26 ] - previous childbirth-related trauma ; sexual abuse ) , maladaptive cognition [ 27 ] ( pre-existing , maladaptive schema ; negative cognitive appraisal past childbirth ; autobiographical memory specificity , fear upcoming childbirth ) , nature delivery [ 28 , 29 ] ( type number intervention ; duration , fear harm self baby , emergency cesarean section ( CS ) , instrumental delivery- especially forceps- assist , episiotomy ) , perception care medical staff [ 24 , 29 ] , perception loss control [ 24 , 30 ] , perception pain [ 24 ] , infant complication [ 28-29 ] ( especially low birth weight , low Apgar score , asphyxia , resuscitation , prematurity ) , peritraumatic dissociation [ 31-32 ] - feeling unreality ; alteration perception time place ; feel disconnection body ) . Women unplanned caesarean section birth likely report PTSD-type symptom . However , association PTSD type symptom plan caesarean section birth [ 16 , 33 ] . PTSD also associate preeclampsia [ 34-35 ] . Preeclampsia associate maternal complication ( e.g . eclampsia , abruptio placenta , pulmonary edema , acute renal failure ) [ 36-37 ] , perinatal complication ( e.g . fetal growth restriction , preterm delivery , perinatal death ) [ 38 , 39-40 ] . As previously describe , adverse pregnancy outcome know associated PTSD [ 41 , 43 , 44 -46 ] . Other seemingly routine aspect pregnancy may increase vulnerability active PTSD , especially victim childhood sexual trauma intrafamilial abuse [ 47 , 48 , 3-4 ] , previous pregnancy loss [ 5,6 ] prior traumatic birth [ 7 ] , pregnancy result sexual assault . Inherent physical aspect pregnancy increase breast sensitivity fetal movement potentially trigger . Routine aspect prenatal care , include vaginal breast examination , trigger , especially sexual trauma survivor . Labor , especially medicalised labor exacerbate sense powerlessness vulnerability , trigger PTSD symptom [ 49 ] . Physical change pregnancy , especially cardiovascular , respiratory , gastrointestinal renal system alteration , also could affect experience PTSD symptom [ 49 ] , since might resemble physical sensation associate anxiety . It unclear whether traumatic birth experience lead type psychopathology , postpartum depression anxiety disorder , research need answer question . However , since know association traumatic experience affective anxiety disorder general- one surmise association exist also disorder traumatic birth experience [ 10 , 12 , 16 ] . It believe PTSD severity childbirth reach plateau 12 month postpartum , without improvement , mean woman postpartum PTSD spontaneously recover [ 50 ] . Thus , many afflict woman develop chronic disorder significantly interfere function various area life . PTSD postpartum period important public health issue longer-term negative impact maternal mental health problem child development [ 8 ] include impaired mother-infant relationship [ 9-10 ] , delay intellectual development [ 11,12 ] , psychiatric disorder child [ 51 ] . In many PTSD patient baby become constant reminder traumatic birth . Some woman report felt guilty blame baby traumatic childbirth experience . PTSD within 11 month postpartum associate depression within 11 month postpartum . Little known mother-child bonding woman PTSD childbirth , negative impact maternal postnatal depression child development investigate different author show especially chronicity maternal depression birth predictor negative development [ 28 , 12 ] . PTSD childbirth- pathophysiology Pregnancy associate alteration hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian ( HPO ) axis , particularly increase plasma concentration progesterone estrogen , modulate mood cognition . Pregnancy also associate change hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis , include increase plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone cortisol , large increase plasma corticotropin-releasing hormone , especially third trimester ( placental secretion ) [ 16 ] . In addition stress hormone , cortisol appear affect memory , salience , social cognition , negative mood , [ 52 ] alertness sleep [ 52 ] . It possible alter hormonal milieu HPA HPO ax pregnancy could affect expression PTSD symptom increase frequency emotional intensity traumatic memory , turn affect mood , motivation , social cognition , sleep , concentration [ 33 ] . PTSD childbirth- assessment tool . Several validate rating scale use PTSD research . The gold standard Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale DSM-5 ( CAPS-5 ) , rat researcher necessitates time experience administration . PTSD Symptoms Scale ( PSS ) PTSD Checklist DSM-5 ( PCL-5 ) self- report short rating scale . Also use depression rating scale Montgomery- Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS , researcher- administer ) , Major Depression Inventory ( MDI , self- report ) Edingurgh Postnatal Depression Scale ( EPDS , self- report , specifically create ass symptom peri- postpartum depression ) [ 53 ] . Research goal . Determination incidence prevalence PTSD type psychopathology ( anxiety affective disorder ) traumatic birth experience elucidation salient risk factor local population sample- prospective follow-up . Materials method We shall apply local Helsinki Committee receive approval research . The participant receive explanation sign inform consent . Compare cohort woman perinatal complication ( emergency CS , instrumental delivery , premature labor , serious hemorrhage childbirth , perineal tear require stitching , resuscitation newborn , newborn admit neonatal intensive care unit ) control cohort healthy woman deliver elective uncomplicated CS . For woman cohort first pregnancy first childbirth . Assess help rating scale ( researcher- administer self- report , CAPS , PCL-C , MADRS , MDI , EPDS ) first two day follow childbirth measure baseline parameter assess prevalence acute stress reaction ( ASR ) research control cohorts . Assess cohorts method 1 month childbirth . Compare prevalence PTSD different cohort perinatal complication control cohort . Also- compare prevalence PTSD , anxiety mood disorder different group perinatal complication order determine type complication carry great risk development psychopathology . Determine whether development ASR 2 day childbirth predictive PTSD type psychopathology 1 month childbirth . Thus- determine prevalence PTSD type psychopathology 1 month birth risk group versus control , prospectively .</detailed_description>
