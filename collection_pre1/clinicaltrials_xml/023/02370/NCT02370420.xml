	<brief_title>Intra-Articular Injections Platelet-Rich Plasma Knee Osteoarthritis : Unique Application Versus Triple Application</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) refer clinical syndrome joint pain multifactorial etiology , gradual loss articular cartilage , osteophytosis formation , subchondral bone remodel inflammation joint . Is common cause knee pain , one lead cause disability dependence adult population generate large expenditure area health . The clinical diagnosis OA primarily clinical - radiological , base complete medical history physical examination direct . No laboratory study routinely request since specific diagnostic test pathognomonic diagnosis . Physical examination important . The ideal treatment multidisciplinary one , must meet objective achieve anesthesia , reduce disability improve joint function patient 's quality life , low toxicity drug . Several conservative treatment recommend clinical guideline . Some nonpharmacologic measure : patient education , exercise , weight loss , modification footwear , use local cryotherapy , acupuncture electromagnetic therapy . Drug therapy summarize paracetamol , NSAIDs , opioids , slow-acting drug . If oral drug work administer intra-articularly ( corticosteroid , viscosupplementation product , blood derivates ) . Platelet-Rich Plasma ( PRP ) rich source growth factor Platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , transform growth factor β ( TGF- β ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , like growth factor type I insulin ( IGF- I ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( EGF ) , among others . For growth factor release , platelet need activate substance calcium chloride , calcium gluconate thrombin . Once activate , growth factor secrete , reach peak concentration 10 minute . It known GF , PDGF TGF -B stimulate chondrogenesis help solve clinical manifestation patient study . The investigator include patient attend outpatient clinic area Orthopedics Traumatology hospital diagnosis knee osteoarthritis , treatment medical . Patients divide two group . In group , give verbal , clear detail information approach follow , intra-articular application Platelet-Rich Plasma knee , plus rehabilitation exercise . In first group hold single application , second group three application make interval two week . Both group assess application , together outpatient follow-up SF-12 , WOMAC Visual Analogue Scale . The PRP would obtain previous asepsis antisepsis patient 's arm , 30cc blood form Basilic vein would extract . Each sample initially centrifuge 1800 rpm 10 minute centrifuge sample would separate three layer : 1- Red Cell ( low ) White 2- ( plasma rich growth factor ) Yellow 3- ( plasma poor growth factor ) .1000 ul PRP ( yellow layer ) extract place 15 mL Falcon tube subsequently perform second step centrifugation 3400 rpm 12 minute . The top layer platelet poor plasma remove stayed low layer , PRP ( 3-5 mL ) . Before application patient 's knee , calcium gluconate 10 % add , 0.15 mL per milliliter PRP obtain . The sample would aspirate 10 mL syringe application patient . After asepsis antisepsis puncture site , sterile drape place clear workspace , PRP inject technique 45 ° corner superior- lateral patellar , reach joint capsule . Once injected PRP , sterile pad application area place .</detailed_description>
