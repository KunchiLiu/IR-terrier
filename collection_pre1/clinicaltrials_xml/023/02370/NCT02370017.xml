	<brief_title>Combined Effect Natural Killer Cell Doublet Chemotherapy Advanced NSCLC 1st Line Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based additive synergistic effect natural killer ( NK ) cell chemotherapy ( modulate expression NK stimulatory ligand tumor cell ) , investigator perform phase II trial docetaxel ANKL combination second line treatment advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLN ) report result May 2013 . ( Anticancer Research 33 ; 2115 , Poster Presentation ASCO ) .In study , investigator observe feasibility safety ANKL combine docetaxel patient advance NSCLC , clinical benefit evaluate properly study interrupt unintentionally enrolled patient far advanced large tumor burden , , poor immunological environment ANKL work . The object study identify combine effect ANKL doublet chemotherapy advance NSCLC . The approved doublet chemotherapy base platinum widely use response rate ( RR ) 25-35 % 4-6 course first line treatment . The investigator design combination ANKL chemotherapy 3rd 4th course patient show stable response x2 course . Higher RR combination treatment primary outcome compare chemotherapy alone - historical control ; 12 % PR 50 % stable response x2 initial course 25 % PR x2 course among patient get stable response x2 initial course . Peripheral blood 32 ml draw patient decide enrol 2 week later ANKL ( 2x10*9 ) schedule administer rapidly iv 12-36hr chemotherapeutic agent peak effect NK cell ligand modulation chemotherapeutic agent maintain . After 4th course , response evaluation do RECIST 40 % PR ( increase 15 % historical control 25 % ) expect target Simon 's two stage design apply study ( power 80 % , a= 0.95 , N1= 33 , N= 68 )</detailed_description>
