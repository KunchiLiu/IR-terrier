	<brief_summary>The aim study explore efficacy 18F-FSPG detection primary metastatic brain cancer lesion confirm standard truth , preferably histology . This single center , open label , non-randomized study . A total 30 subject brain tumor brain metastasis enrol . All different stage malignancy recruit , include different type pathology grade , newly diagnose recurrent disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Imaging Intracranial Cancers With 18F-FSPG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects various type grade primary brain tumor brain metastasis recruit . The brain tumor need either histologically clinically confirm . 18F-FSPG injected intravenously subject , PET/CT image perform . Images assess visually quantitatively . Available tumor specimen analyze immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) example expression component system xc- associated biomarkers .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent 2 . Participant must able complete PET/CT scan MRI without use sedation 3 . Participant primary brain tumor histologically confirm OR confirm suspected recurrent brain cancer brain metastasis primary tumor histologically confirm , OR brain lesion concern malignancy histopathological confirmation anticipate follow enrollment ( e.g. , biopsy surgical resection tumor schedule ) OR suspect lowgrade brain tumor , confirmation base upon combination imaging ( e.g . PET/CT , MRI , diagnostic CT ) clinical assessment . All pathology specimen must within 1 year plan 18FFSPG PET/CT scan . 4 . The time interval 18FFSPG PET/CT imaging ( include PET/CTs , MRI diagnostic CT ) within 4 week ( exception allow 6 week , option ) 5 . Karnofsky Performance Status Scale 60 high OR ECOG Performance Status 02 . 6 . No clinically relevant deviation renal function ( Serum Creatinine &gt; Grade 2 CTCAE v4.0. ) . Maximal interval confirmation injection 18FFSPG one week . 7 . No chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immune/biologic therapy schedule perform image ( PET/CTs , MRI , diagnostic CTs ) and18FFSPG PET/CT . 1 . Patient schedule brain surgery and/or another invasive procedure within time period one month prior 18FFSPG administration . Minimally invasive needle biopsy allow . 2 . Known hypersensitivity study drug component preparation 3 . Patient complete participation another clinical study involve administration investigational agent precede 4 week . However , participation clinical study involve investigational PET SPECT tracer exclude opinion Investigator : evaluation 18FFSPG safety tolerability confound investigational PET SPECT tracer minimum two day ( long necessary base radiological halflife ) elapse investigational PET SPECT tracer administration allow acceptable clearance tracer investigational PET SPECT tracer administration well tolerated patient . 4 . Investigator precludes participation scientific reason , reason compliance ( e.g. , concurrent disease could compromise subject 's study completion ) , reason patient 's safety</criteria>
