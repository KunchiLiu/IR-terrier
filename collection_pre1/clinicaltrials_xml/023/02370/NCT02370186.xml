	<brief_summary>Severe sepsis result 300,000 Emergency Department ( ED ) visit 215,000 death annually US . Currently effective drug therapy sepsis . High density lipoprotein ( HDL ) antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , antithrombotic property protective sepsis . Its function sepsis primarily mediate main apolipoprotein , Apo-A1 , : 1 ) neutralize potent bacterial toxin , 2 ) protect blood vessel wall damage , 3 ) prevent tissue damage antioxidant property , 4 ) mediate thymocyte apoptosis ( critical survival ) endogenous corticosteroid release . However , recent literature present inconsistent data HDL functionality show HDL become non-functional acute inflammatory state call dysfunctional HDL ( Dys-HDL ) . Several cause Dys-HDL hypothesize include presence Apo A1 polymorphism , may worsen pathologic inflammatory response sepsis demonstrate early sepsis , make Dys-HDL unstudied potential early marker . This project aim : 1 ) determine presence Dys-HDL adult patient early severe sepsis present ED ( Dys-HDL test use novel cell free assay HDL Inflammatory Index measure ) , 2 ) examine relationship Dys-HDL cumulative organ dysfunction via Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score . Results study could establish Dys-HDL early disease marker sepsis influential development sepsis-induced organ dysfunction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Dysfunctional HDL Severe Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis systemic inflammatory response infection , lead acute organ dysfunction shock . Current therapy aim normalizing hemodynamic parameter early sepsis resuscitation reduce mortality . The investigator hypothesize future strategy personalize , target mediator septic response individual patient basis . One mediator HDL work facilitate clearance bacterial toxin , maintain integrity endothelium , prevent inflammation , function perform Apo-A1 . The association HDL cardiovascular health well-studied Caucasian Asian population , research demonstrate HDL become pro-inflammatory thus may perform function anti-inflammatory , anti-thrombotic anti-oxidant . Such HDL call Dys-HDL . Dys-HDL pro-inflammatory HDL may play pivotal role sepsis , area fully study . The mechanism HDL become dysfunctional one debate , main hypothesis polymorphisms Apo-A1 , possibly via myeloperoxidase enzyme , polymorphism produce different HDL level activity . These alteration lead increase susceptibility septic death due inability neutralize lipopolysaccharide , loss thymocyte apoptosis ( critical protection sepsis ) endogenous corticosteroid release , loss ability preserve HDLs antioxidant property . Dys-HDL also demonstrate early sepsis may serve potential early disease marker . For reason , investigator believe Dys-HDL may play pivotal role sepsis cascade lead organ dysfunction death . Aim 1 . Determine presence Dys-HDL adult patient early severe sepsis present ED . Aim 2 . Examine relationship Dys-HDL cumulative organ dysfunction measure sequential organ failure assessment ( SOFA ) score , validated measure organ dysfunction severe sepsis .</detailed_description>
