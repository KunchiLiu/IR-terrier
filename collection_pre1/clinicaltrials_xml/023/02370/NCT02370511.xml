	<detailed_description>Design : A prospective pilot study enrol extremely high surgical risk patient symptomatic severe calcific mitral valve disease undergoing implantation Edwards Sapien XT SAPIEN 3 valve mitral position . There two arm study evaluate two separate patient population describe : - Native Mitral Valve severe Mitral Annular Calcification ( MAC ) : Patients symptomatic severe disease native mitral valve due severe mitral annular calcification . - Valve ring : Patients symptomatic fail surgical ring result severe mitral regurgitation stenosis . The delivery approach include : standard transeptal , modify transeptal approach guidewire externalize sheath percutaneously place left ventricle , surgical trasnapical surgical transatrial delivery approach without surgical resection anterior MV leaflet ( native mitral valve arm ) . The MITRAL Trial site investigative team ( heart team ) consist dedicated representative cardiac surgery , interventional cardiology , echocardiology , neurology , study coordination multi-disciplinary team member consistent transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) model .

The secondary endpoint evaluate two time point : ( 1 ) acute , cover event occur 30 day hospital discharge , whichever long ; ( 2 ) longer-term , cover event 31 day 1 year . The specific component composite : - stroke TIA - myocardial infarction - major vascular complication ( MVARC ) - life-threatening bleeding ( MVARC ) - reoperation catheter-based intervention : valve thrombosis , valve displacement , valve place procedure-related complication - hemolysis - endocarditis - moderate severe central mitral insufficiency ≥ 2 ( + ) , and/or moderate severe perivalvular leak cause ≥ 2 ( + ) mitral insufficiency - significant mitral stenosis ( mean MVG &gt; 10 mmHg ) - permanent pacemaker insertion - new aortic valve dysfunction - new LVOT gradient ≥ 20 mmHg , ≥ 20 mmHg increase baseline LVOT gradient . - acute kidney injury ( MVARC ) Additional Safety Endpoints : 1 .

Freedom access site infection 6 . Freedom new permanent pacemaker 7 . Freedom atrial fibrillation visit 8 . Procedure related complication composite : two endpoint base MVARC definition 9 . A non-hierarchical composite stroke , major vascular complication reintervention . The endpoint evaluate 30 day 1 year . 10 . Freedom transfusion Additional Effectiveness Endpoints : 1 . Total day alive hospital ( date index procedure ) 2 . Clinical improvement per NYHA Class ( baseline ) least 1 class . 3 . Clinical improvement per Quality Life instrument ( &gt; 10 point baseline ) : ( KCCQ 12 ) ( Appendix N ) 4 . Clinical improvement per 6 Minute Walk Test ( &gt; 50 meter baseline ) 5 meter walk test . ( Appendix H ) 5 . Mean ICU total index procedure hospital length stay Additional Valve Performance Endpoints : 1 . Freedom major mitral paravalvular leak 2 . Improvement hemodynamic function : effective orifice area 3 . Improvement hemodynamic function : mean gradient 4 . Freedom structural valve deterioration 5 .
