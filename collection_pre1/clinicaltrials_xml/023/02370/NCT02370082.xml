	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate performance SAVI SCOUT® Surgical Guidance System ( SAVI SCOUT ) . The SAVI SCOUT medical device , use provide real-time guidance localize excisional biopsy lumpectomy procedure , help surgeon locate remove desire tissue ( i.e. , lesion surround normal tissue ) . The SAVI SCOUT 510K clear . The SAVI SCOUT intend assist surgeon location retrieval non-palpable abnormality localize radiographic ultrasound method . In study , ability SAVI SCOUT guide surgeon find lesion evaluate instead standard technique wire localization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SAVI SCOUT Clinical Evaluation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using radiography ultrasound guidance , SAVI SCOUT reflector place percutaneously 7 day prior schedule excisional procedure . During surgical excision , SAVI SCOUT system use locate reflector , remove along surround breast tissue . Final data analysis complete within 1 month last patient treat . Final assessment surgical result complete surgeon routine follow-up visit within 1 month follow surgical excision lumpectomy procedure . Main Objective : show SAVI SCOUT technique use safely effectively locate non-palpable breast lesion localize excisional biopsy lumpectomy procedure . Up 10 site 150 patient enrol .</detailed_description>
