	<brief_summary>Sleep disturbance nearly ubiquitous among individual suffer PTSD major problem among service member return combat deployment . The propose study aim test novel , inexpensive , easy use approach improve sleep among service member PTSD . Primary outcome measure include PTSD symptom improvement also include neuroimaging brain structure , function , connectivity , neurochemistry change . The proposal firmly ground emerge scientific literature regard sleep , light exposure , brain function , anxiety , resilience . Prior evidence suggest bright light therapy effective improve mood fatigue , pilot data suggest treatment may effective improve daytime sleepiness brain function brain injured individual . Thus , intervention , research work others , show affect critical sleep regulatory system . Improving sleep may vital component recovery service member . Our approach would directly address issue . Our preliminary data show approach extremely well tolerate effective improve sleep , mood , cognitive performance , brain function among individual brain injury . Finally , potential impact study high capability transition research direct clinical application almost immediately . If bright light treatment demonstrate effective , approach would readily available nearly immediate large-scale implementation , device widely use year contexts , already safety test , commercially available several manufacturer low cost . Thus , impact research treat PTSD would high immediate .</brief_summary>

History head injury loss consciousness posttraumatic amnesia , major neurological illness ; medical neurologic condition would confound interpretation result , include alcohol ( verified via Standard Drink handout subject ) drug abuse/dependence past 6 month , neurological disorder ; mixed lefthandedness ; abnormal visual acuity correct contact lens ( necessary see stimuli scanner environment ) ; IQ estimate le 80 ; metal within body , pregnancy , contraindication MRI procedures ; time since return deployment exceed 36 month ; previous formal treatment light therapy ; history lightinduced migraine epilepsy ; medical complication could elevate risk discomfort associate lighttherapy ; use medication could affect functional neuroimaging result ( e.g. , fluoxetine , betablockers ) . Patients currently take psychotropic medication ( i.e. , `` treatment usual '' ) must stabilize least 4weeks prior participation . Although participant excluded participation , detailed history dosage document examined appropriate statistical analysis . ISI score 8 . Participants exclude currently take anticipate need take sleepinducing medication ( e.g. , zolpidem ) supplement know effect sleep ( e.g. , melatonin ) course study .</criteria>
