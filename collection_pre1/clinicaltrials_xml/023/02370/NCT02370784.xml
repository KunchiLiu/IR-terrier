	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn effect atorvastatin blood vessel function Raynaud symptoms patient early diffuse systemic sclerosis . Systemic sclerosis disease characterize blood vessel injury , immune system activation fibrosis . Blood vessel injury think important early disease . Blood vessel complication systemic sclerosis include Raynaud phenomenon , finger toe ulcer , pulmonary hypertension . While atorvastatin reduces cholesterol , recognize many effect beyond cholesterol reduction . These include improvement blood vessel function reduction fibrosis . We hypothesize treatment atorvastatin 16 week improve blood vessel function Raynaud symptom patient early diffuse systemic sclerosis . We hope target therapy early disease may delay blood vessel change improve Raynaud symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atorvastatin Microvascular Endothelial Function Raynaud Early Diffuse Scleroderma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) multisystem autoimmune illness characterize vasculopathy , immune system activation fibrosis skin internal organ . SSc affect approximately 240 people per million US , disease FDA approve medication . Current hypothesis pathogenesis suggest vascular injury endothelial dysfunction may incite event contribute immunologic activation fibrosis pathogenesis disease . More 90 % individual SSc vascular complication include Raynaud phenomenon , digital ulcer gangrene pulmonary hypertension ; microvascular abnormality felt contribute Raynaud digital ulceration . Statin medication well-recognized pleiotropic effect may modify three aspect SSc pathogenesis . Early diagnosis treatment microvascular endothelial dysfunction Raynaud phenomeonan may greatest effect early disease . Thus , hypothesize treatment atorvastatin well-defined cohort early diffuse systemic sclerosis produce beneficial result . Participants patient early diffuse systemic sclerosis Raynaud phenomenon history cardiovascular disease diabetes . A total 30 patient enrol follow 16 week . Half patient randomize atorvastatin half placebo . Patients allow continue underlie immunosuppressive Raynaud therapy stable dos trial . Since pilot study , future large control trial necessary clearly demonstrate drug effectiveness . Investigators hop study give u signal guide future multicenter clinical trial .</detailed_description>
