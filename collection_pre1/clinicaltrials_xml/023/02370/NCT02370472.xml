	<brief_summary>The use Ultrasound Guided Regional Anaesthesia ( USRA ) increase last decade . Theoretically , ultrasound imaging may increase efficacy safety allow visualization needle pathway local anaesthetic spread around nerve . In addition knowledge anatomy general principle ultrasonography , USRA require learn new skill image interpretation , needle-beam alignment , needle trajectory tracking . The hand-eye coordination require needle advancement require practice master needle must properly align ultrasound probe order maintain needle path beam time . Adding difficulty , hand needle movement occur three ax , ultrasound image see two dimension . Since ability acquire necessary skill perform USRA subjective yet validate , difficult recommend single , effective training pathway . Currently , method supervise train perform USRA procedure actual patient involve practice needle insertion phantom cadaver . Studies assess impact learn use method lack . It possible practitioner may choose alternative one-off learning method . Such method standardize thus difficult evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation New Training Model Ultrasound Guided Regional Anesthesia - A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single site , prospective , pre-test-post-test , randomize study conduct Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval . Thirty subject , include medical student , practice anaesthesiologists anaesthesia resident train Penn State Hershey Medical Center , recruit formal email invitation participate . Written consent obtain participant inclusion study participant complete pre-study form . Once enrolled study , participant give 10 minute familiarize ultrasound equipment ( SonoSite , MTurbo , Bothell , WA , USA ) phantom model ( MiniSimâ„¢ Upper Extremity Series , Life tech Inc. , Stafford , Texas , USA ) . They also view pre-recorded video demonstrate task perform . As pre-test , participant perform require Needle Insertion Accuracy ( NIA ) task 3 consecutive time assess use score form adapt Mayo Clinic . After complete pre-test , participant randomly divide two group , experimental control , computer-generated randomization list ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . Participants blind group assignment . Previously , report detail new learn tool . Briefly , spatial movement occur three dimension label x-axis , y-axis z-axis . A video camera record movement two ax . By place second video camera 90 degree first camera , third axis record well one axis common first camera . Video recording store electronically hard-drive review individually combination , normal speed , slow necessary . Still image also obtain . The experimental group allow practice pre-test task use ultrasound machine phantom model . On single computer screen , able visualize hand needle movement along position ultrasound probe . The control group allow practice pre-test task use ultrasound machine phantom model without add visual aid . Both group allow practice pre-test task maximum 30 minute , record self-assessment proficient proficient time . Both group perform post-test , task use pre-test , trainee evaluate use score tool . To avoid subjective variation inter-rater variability , evaluation record single blind investigator . Statistical analysis Pre- post-test mean score ( range 5 to15 ) analyze use statistical method determine whether new learn tool improve NIA skill require USRA . Pre-test post-test score ( range 5 15 ) obtain triplicate average produce representative assessment participant . The primary endpoint change NIA score baseline , i.e. , score difference obtain subtract mean pre-test score mean post-test score . A sample size 15 subject per group ( experimental control ) provide 80 % power detect effect size 1 , base two-sided t-test 5 % error probability ( calculate use G*Power version 3.1 ) . Analysis primary endpoint utilized two-sided , two-sample t-test 5 % level significance . Secondary analysis evaluate intervention effect novice trainee , trainee prior USRA experience . Score difference individual NIA skill ( movement , alignment , approach , target , location ) also analyze .</detailed_description>
