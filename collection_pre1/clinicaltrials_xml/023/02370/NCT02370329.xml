	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial study P1101 ( polyethyleneglycol [ PEG ] -proline-interferon alpha-2b ) treat patient myelofibrosis . PEG-proline-interferon alpha-2b substance improve body 's natural response may slow growth myelofibrosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>P1101 Treating Patients With Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate clinical response ( complete remission [ CR ] , partial remission [ PR ] , clinical improvement [ CI ] ) define International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research Treatment ( IWG-MRT ) criterion cohort intermediate-2/high risk myelofibrosis ( MF ) patient . Response second cohort early stage MF patient also describe . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate adverse event profile P1101 patient myelofibrosis cohort ( early v intermediate-2/high risk ) . II . To evaluate tolerability P1101 patient myelofibrosis cohort ( early v intermediate-2/high risk ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate quality life ( QOL ) patient-reported symptom use Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form ( MPN-SAF ) P1101 patient myelofibrosis cohort ( early v intermediate-2/high risk ) . II . To evaluate impact P1101 bone marrow histological feature myelofibrosis include cytogenetics , blast percentage , fibrosis , JAK2-V617F allele burden cohort ( early v intermediate-2/high risk ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive PEG-proline-interferon alpha-2b subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
