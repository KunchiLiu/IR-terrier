	<brief_summary>Bowel care ( BC ) time-consuming cumbersome activity daily live individual SCI . Previous study report average time complete BC routine 45 minute ; 10-20 % SCI individual report BC routines last 1 hour . In past study , investigator show medication call neostigmine increase bowel activity thus , promote bowel movement . The investigator successfully use medication traditional novel method colonoscopic preparation , show improves quality preparation . In study , would like test applicability medication bowel care routine . The investigator believe addition medication begin regular bowel regiment significantly decrease time effort need complete BC , thus improve patient perception BC routines quality life . SCI individual follow James J Peters VA Medical Center ( JJPVAMC ) SCI Medical Service admit routine basis inpatient respite care , therapy , and/or annual physicals . Such inpatient stay typically range duration 1 week 3 week , patient undergo BC routine assist inpatient care team . BC routines typically perform every day , thrice weekly ( Monday , Wednesday , Friday ) `` Blue Rooms '' locate inpatient SCI ward ( IE ID ) . The bowel care routine , include duration procedure , use assistive medication device , completeness bowel care document patient ' electronic medical chart ( CPRS ) care provider . The investigator propose perform describe protocol individual admit hospital routine care otherwise healthy . In , investigator ensure patient vigilantly monitor BC session , change BC pattern accurately observe document . Furthermore , perform procedure inpatient basis , study investigator ensure consistency care daily routine , allow good control study condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Part 1 : IV Screening Twenty subject chronic SCI ( &gt; 1 year ) difficulty evacuation ( DWE ) manage regular , thrice weekly BC routine recruit study participation . In order determine eligibility study , subject undergo IV screen test whether responsive drug treatment ( neostigmine-glycopyrrolate ) . If subject responds ( bowel movement ) IV treatment , allow continue part 2 study . If patient successful bowel movement , consider non-responder study participation discontinue . Part 2 : Baseline Dose Titration Once eligibility determine , subject consent obtain , subject undergo 1 week baseline observation admission . An abdominal x-ray ( KUB ) perform , SCI Bowel Survey Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire ( TSQM ) administer , subject 's weight determine . Each subject continue regular bowel care inpatient , 1 week , baseline measurement ( KUB , weight survey ) repeat . This follow 2 visit- dose titration study concomitantly administer , transcutaneous neostigmine methylsulfate ( NEO ) glycopyrrolate ( GLY ) . Each visit schedule BC day . All procedure take place `` Blue Room '' locate SCI inpatient ward . Subjects prone throughout duration study , stretcher routinely use bowel care . As part setup , subject instrument blood pressure cuff ; intravenous access obtain peripheral vein ( one available ) , precautionary measure , since drug administer via Iontophoresis transdermal patch . Heart rate continuously monitor throughout procedure finger oximetry . Symptoms assess every 5 minute first 30 minute , 1 hour post drug administration . Once subject positive response one two dos , high dose perform , dose titration stop . If subject positive response ( bowel movement within 60 minute drug administration ) he/she eligible continue third study phase . If subject respond either dose , subject consider non-responder study participation discontinue . We expect 1/3rd subject non-responders , lose attrition ; therefore , prepare over-recruit 5 subject order ensure least 15 subject eligible complete second part study . The study stop patient experience bowel movement within 30 minute administer ION NEO protocol objective achieve . If patient experience cardiopulmonary side effect receive ION NEO low dos effectively reverse ION GLY , study stop . In addition , study investigator reserve right stop study safety concern . Part 3 : 2 Week Treatment Each subject assess perception current BC routine use Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Medication ( TSQM-Appendix 1 ) , bowel habit use bowel survey ( Appendix 2 ) .The subject ask continue normal BC routine two week inpatient stay , exception NEO GLY administer begin BC session adjunct subject 's normal routine . Each BC session document study team member include time need complete BC , method use ( i.e . number enema use , oral laxative , suppository , digital stimulation , abdominal massage ) quality completeness bowel movement . Heart rate , oxygenation blood pressure monitor continuously . Subjects weigh baseline , week treatment post treatment follow-up visit . After two week treatment , subject undergo final KUB reassess perception BC routine past two week use TSQM bowel habit ( bowel survey ) .</detailed_description>
