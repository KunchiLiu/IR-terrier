	<brief_title>Comparing Combining Bortezomib Mycophenolate SSc Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) chronic multisystem autoimmune connective tissue disease etiology remain unknown . The prevalence SSc 19-75 case per 100,000 frequent woman , peak occurrence 4th 5th decade life . Morbidity Mortality SSc substantial pulmonary complication lead cause death among patient SSc . Bortezomib FDA approve therapy treatment multiple myeloma malignancy . The investigator data bortezomib inhibits TGF- signal vitro promotes normal repair prevents lung fibrosis TGF-mediated intratracheal bleomycin mouse model well mouse model skin fibrosis . This consistent data literature proteasomal inhibition prevent development fibrosis . Further multiple report efficacy bortezomib ameliorate cGVHD patient allogeneic HSCT multiple myeloma . Bortezomib also well tolerate large clinical trial multiple myeloma patient neuropathy thrombocytopenia primary adverse event . No pulmonary toxicity report study . Mycophenolate mofetil ( CellCept Myfortic ) belong class medication know immunosuppressive . This medication use originally management patient organ transplant , recommend treatment autoimmune diseases SSc . Mycophenolate mofetil target enzyme body call inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase important formation deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) cell . By interfere DNA , medication impairs function immune system cell become overactive autoimmune disease . Mycophenolate mofetil currently approve treatment patient SSc . This study conduct establish safety tolerability bortezomib SSc patient high risk pulmonary disease progression . In addition , study examine effect bortezomib rate FVC decline ( physiologic parameter closely associated disease outcome ) clinical parameter . In addition investigator also measure effect bortezomib biomarkers associate fibroblast activation . If successful , study provide rationale multi-center placebo control trial test efficacy bortezomib SSc patient high risk progressive pulmonary disease .</detailed_description>
