	<brief_summary>Recent evidence suggest high -intensity interval training ( HIIT ) may effective strategy improve cardiorespiratory fitness , exercise performance , insulin sensitivity . In addition , creatine ( Cr ) , nitrogen- containing compound , widely use enhance high intensity exercise performance . A seminal study demonstrate muscle content Cr phosphocreatine ( PCr ) elevate exogenous Cr . Oral intake Cr increase concentration blood muscle , part increase muscle Cr transform PCr ( process catalyze Cr kinase ) . Cr supplementation increase total Cr ( TCr = Cr + PCr ) ~20 % , PCr component account 10 % increase . Combining HIIT Cr intrigue two reasons; first , Cr supplementation improve performance increase PCr , PCr recovery , muscle buffering may facilitate high training intensity therefore great training adaptation . Secondly , Cr HIIT individually show increase GLUT 4 insulin sensitivity , suggest Cr supplementation may adjunct HIIT improve glucose control . To date , two study investigate performance effect Cr combine HIIT preliminary positive result . No study examine impact combine Cr + HIIT outcomes related insulin sensitivity . Therefore , purpose research examine combine effect Cr HIIT performance insulin sensitivity determine via oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) young healthy adult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : To determine whether combine creatine high intensity interval training ( HIIT ) result well exercise performance insulin sensitivity compare HIIT combine placebo healthy subject . HYPOTHESES : ) Creatine + HIIT result improve exercise performance compare placebo; b ) Creatine + HIIT result improve insulin sensitivity compare placebo . OBJECTIVES : To determine whether combine creatine high intensity interval training ( HIIT ) result well exercise performance insulin sensitivity compare HIIT combine placebo healthy subject . RESEARCH METHOD : A double blind placebo randomize control trial ( RCT ) 24 healthy young volunteer participate HIIT three time week , four week . Participants stratify sex randomize one two interventions; 1 ) HIIT plus Cr , 2 ) HIIT plus placebo . STATISTICAL ANALYSES : A 2 ( group ) x 2 ( time ) way repeat measure ANOVA use analyze variable . Descriptive statistic ( mean , standard deviation [ SD ] , frequency ) calculate . Histograms use identify outlier test normality . Data skew distribution log-transformed prior statistical testing . Within group difference examine paired t-test . 24 participant include RCT . Sample size calculation compute use mean standard deviation previous Cr + HIIT study [ 11 ] show significant increase cycle critical power Cr + HIIT ( 6.72 +/- 2.54 % increase ) compare Placebo + HIIT ( 3.82 +/- 2.30 % ) . With 80 % power alpha 0.05 indicate 11 participant per group need . To preserve power account potential drop-out recruit 12 per group .</detailed_description>
