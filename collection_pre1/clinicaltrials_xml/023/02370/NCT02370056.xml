	<detailed_description>Three-dimensional ( 3D ) visualization technology laparoscopy propose , since early 1990 's , method facilitate laparoscopic performance . However , early 3D laparoscopic technology limit term image quality , use implement . The late technical development ensure high-definition 3D visualization quality current two-dimensional ( 2D ) system provide . The anticipated advantage 3D laparoscopic visualization surgeon great accuracy speed manual skill , translate decrease operative time , reduce learn curve , superior safety . It report , 3D laparoscopic visualization offer significant advantage enhance laparoscopic performance , even novice surgeon , compare 2D system . We hypothesize 3D visualization may allow surgeon reduce overall operating time rate 10 % comparable perioperative postoperative outcome . The primary endpoint study determine feasibility laparoscopic approach use 3D visualization surgical treatment ulcerative colitis . Secondary endpoint determine whether 3D visualization confers benefit reduce operating time intra-operative complication comparable postoperative outcome . Device Description : The EXERA III Universal Platform use study , conjunction ENDOEYE FLEX 3D . The ENDOEYE FLEX 3D also use 2D mode , utilize programmed button handle scope , use 2D/3D button 3D Visualization Unit . The articulate tip ENDOEYE FLEX allow scope use single-site multi-port procedure , provide critical view allow bird 's eye view scope way instrument ( still capture image surgical site ) . All equipment use trial clear 510 ( k ) approval FDA , market US since April 2013 . The Olympus HD 3D Laparoscopic Surgical Video System consist follow component : - CV-190 Processor - CLV-190 Light Source - 3DV-190 3D Visualization Unit - LMD-2451MT/3G4 Sony 24 '' 3D Monitor - IMH-20 Image Capture System - UHI-4 Insufflator - K10021611 Cart - OL-0015-08 Tall Rollstand - LTF-190-10-3D ENDOEYE FLEX 3D Videoscope - 3D glass ( regular clip-on style ) Study Size : Mean operate time laparoscopic subtotal colectomy medically refractory UC report longer comparison open surgery recently publish study . Therefore effort decrease operate time laparoscopic colectomy gain importance . We assume , order able determine 10 % reduction mean operating time , group include 27 patient ( 80 % power 5 % significance ) . Patients undergo laparoscopic total abdominal colectomy ( TAC ) UC include study . All subject randomize two group : 3D laparoscopy , 2D laparoscopy . Three staff surgeon ( EG , HK , FR ) department colorectal surgery , Cleveland Clinic , Ohio perform procedures 2D 3D laparoscopy . Each surgeon perform 9 total colectomies 3D , 9 total colectomies 2D laparoscopy system . In total , 54 patient include ( 27 patient group ) .</detailed_description>
