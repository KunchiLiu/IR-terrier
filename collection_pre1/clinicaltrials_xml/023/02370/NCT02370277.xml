	<brief_summary>This pilot research trial study effect chemotherapy intestinal bacteria/organisms ( microbiota ) patient newly diagnose breast cancer . Change intestinal microbiota may associate weight gain patient treat chemotherapy . Weight gain also associate cancer recurrence . Examining type quantity bacterial composition stool breast cancer patient treat chemotherapy may help determine whether body weight composition associate change intestinal microbiota allow doctor plan good treatment prevent weight gain possibly disease recurrence .</brief_summary>
