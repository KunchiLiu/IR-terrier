	<brief_summary>Reparixin oral tablet test CSC target agent patient metastatic non- human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER2 ) -amplified BC . An open label Phase 1b clinical study ( REP0111 ) ongoing ( enrollment complete ) five US site , IND # 112502 , test safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics detect early sign antitumor activity increase dos reparixin oral tablet combination fix dose weekly paclitaxel . The study demonstrate safety tolerability combination across three dose level explore record objective response publish range single agent weekly paclitaxel target population . The high dose level explore ( i.e. , 1200 mg t.i.d . ) identify recommended phase 2 dose . Durable response record patient TNBC . The current phase 2 study thus aim evaluate Progression Free Survival patient metastatic TNBC [ relapse follow ( neo ) adjuvant chemotherapy ] receive reparixin combination paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According cancer stem cell ( CSC ) model , tumor initiate maintain cellular subcomponent display stem cell property . These property include self-renewal , drive tumorigenesis , differentiation ( albeit aberrant ) , contribute tumor cellular heterogeneity . The existence CSCs describe variety haematologic solid tumor include breast , brain , colon , pancreas , lung , liver , head neck . In addition driving tumorigenesis , CSCs may contribute tumor metastasis well tumor recurrence treatment . Although currently available drug shrink metastatic tumor , effect usually transient often appreciably extend life patient . One reason failure treatment acquisition drug resistance cancer cell evolve ; another non-mutually exclusive possibility exist therapy fail kill CSCs . The ability shrink tumor mass mainly reflect ability kill bulk , non CSC tumor cell . This CSCs represent tiny percentage total tumor cell neoplastic lesion majority bulk tumor cell limit proliferative potential . It seem normal stem cell various tissue tend resistant chemotherapeutics mature cell type tissue . The reason clear , may relate high level expression anti- apoptotic protein ATP-binding cassette ( ABC ) transporter multidrug resistance gene . If true CSCs , one would predict cell would resistant chemotherapeutics bulk tumor cell limit proliferative potential . Even therapy cause complete regression tumor might spare enough CSCs allow regrowth tumor . Thus , therapy specifically direct CSCs might result much durable response even cure metastatic tumor . The CSC ( Cancer stem cell ) concept important implication understand carcinogenesis well development cancer therapeutic . According concept , tumor initiate maintain cellular subcomponent display stem cell property . These property include self-renewal , drive tumorigenesis , differentiation ( albeit aberrant ) , contribute tumor cellular heterogeneity . The existence CSCs describe variety hematologic solid tumor include breast , brain , colon , pancreas , lung , liver , head neck . In addition driving tumorigenesis , CSCs may contribute tumor metastasis well tumor recurrence treatment . One therapeutic strategy pursue target CSCs involve inhibition self renewal survival pathways cell . These pathway include NOTCH ( Notch signal pathway ) , Hedgehog , WNT ( Wnt signal pathway ) . Such strategy may limited role pathway normal stem cell function , could result systemic toxicity pathway inhibition . In addition intrinsic pathway regulate stem cell function , normal malignant stem cell regulate extrinsic signal generate microenvironment CSC niche . In breast , niche compose immune cell , mesenchymal element include fibroblast , endothelial cell , adipocytes , extracellular matrix component . These component play important role normal breast development carcinogenesis . If cellular microenvironment play important role regulation CSC growth survival , strategy aim interfere interaction represent rational approach target breast CSCs . There limited data impact treatment tailor base CSCs detection . Gene profile CSCs could lead identification therapeutic target CSCs ( e.g . hormone receptor , HER-2 [ Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ] expression , EGFR [ Epidermal growth factor receptor ] expression ) , could represent tumor biopsy `` real time '' . Several group show frequent discordance HER-2 status primary tumor CSCs , case report show clinical utility use trastuzumab-based therapy base HER-2 CSCs status . Similarly , hormonal status CSCs could different primary tumor , could lead increase number patient suitable endocrine therapy , also could explain endocrine therapy fail subset hormone receptor-positive patient . The study provide vivo demonstration CXCR-1 ( Chemokine receptor 1 ) target specific block antibody reparixin associate reduced systemic metastasis . The experimental data provide another therapeutic target metastatic disease warrant pilot study investigation human explore effect reparixin breast CSCs tumoral microenvironment . Reparixin seem good candidate use breast cancer patient acceptable toxicity profile show Phase I II clinical trial conduct far , along observed activity vitro breast cancer cell line vivo tumor xenograft mouse . It potentially address another therapeutic target metastatic disease . The current phase 2 study thus aim evaluate Progression Free Survival patient metastatic TNBC [ relapse follow ( neo ) adjuvant chemotherapy ] receive reparixin combination paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone .</detailed_description>
