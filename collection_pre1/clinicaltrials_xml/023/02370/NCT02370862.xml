	<brief_summary>Bowel care ( BC ) time-consuming cumbersome activity daily live individual SCI . Previous study report average time complete BC routine 45 minute ; 10-20 % SCI individual report BC routines last 1 hour . In past study , investigator show medication call neostigmine ( NEO ) combine medication call glycopyrrolate ( GLY ) increase bowel activity thus , promote bowel movement . The investigator successfully use medication traditional novel method colonoscopic preparation , show improves quality preparation . In Phase I , proof concept pilot study , investigator propose study effectiveness medicine deliver skin . In order make delivery efficient , investigator use technique call iontophoresis , use mild electric current drive drug surface skin . The instrument include electrode contain active agent ( delivers charge ) oppositely charge electrode ( receive charge ) place surface skin . The study design consist screen visit determine individual 's response previously establish IV dose NEO GLY , follow dose titration study ( two visit ) iontophoresed NEO GLY . Study visit separate less 2 day 14 day . If delivery method show effective , may represent way vastly improve clinical utility medication allow needle-free self administration , expand clinical indication routine , home bowel care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In Phase I , proof concept pilot study , propose study safety efficacy transcutaneous neostigmine glycopyrrolate facilitate iontophoresis . The study design consist screen visit determine individual 's response previously establish IV dose NEO GLY , follow dose titration study ( two visit ) iontophoresed NEO GLY . Study visit separate less 2 day 14 day . Screening Bowel Evacuation Study , Part 1 : Visit 1 ( 30 Subjects SCI ) : A previously determine efficacious dose IV neostigmine ( 0.03 mg/kg IV NEO ) glycopyrrolate ( 0.006 mg/kg GLY ) administer first study visit determine subject responsiveness know effective mode administration . Irregardless excess weight , maximum dose neostigmine glycopyrrolate ( NG ) limit 10.0 mg GLY 2.0 mg . If subject respond IV NEO , subsequent study visit determine effective dose transcutaneous NEO GLY perform . Subjects ask arrive Spinal Cord Research Center James J. Peters Veteran Affairs Medical Center ( JJP VAMC ) ( Room 7A-13 ) day schedule study visit . Heart rate ( continuous ecg ) , blood pressure , airway resistance ( Impulse Oscillometry , IOS ) , sign symptom , artificial bowel evacuation monitor throughout study visit . Subjects remain position bowel movement occur , next 60 minute study . Subjects monitor minimum 1.5 hour post drug , reach ± 10 % baseline heart rate ( continuous 3 lead ECG ) airway caliber measure IOS . Transcutaneous Bowel Evacuation Study , Part 2 : Visits 2-3 ( 25Subjects SCI ) : The subject participate Visit 1 demonstrate response IV NEO GLY participate visit 2-3 . Due probable inter-subject variability drug response dose neostigmine administer , subject receive increase dos iontophoresed neostigmine separate day 2 study visit determine effective average dose . We administer transcutaneous NEO GLY facilitate iontophoresis . The dosage Visits 2-3 follow : Visit 2 : 0.05 mg/kg NEO 0.01 mg/kg GLY , Visit 3 : 0.07 mg/kg NEO 0.14 mg/kg GLY . Irregardless excess weight , maximum dose NG limit 10.0 mg GLY 2.0 mg. Heart rate ( continuous ecg ) , blood pressure , airway resistance ( Impulse Oscillometry , IOS ) sign symptom , artificial bowel evacuation monitor throughout study visit describe Table 1 . Subjects ask arrive Spinal Cord Research Center JJP VAMC ( Room 7A-13 ) day schedule study visit . Subjects remain position bowel movement occur , next 90 minute study . Subjects monitor minimum 90 minute post drug , reach ± 10 % baseline heart rate ( continuous 3 lead ECG ) airway caliber measure IOS .</detailed_description>
