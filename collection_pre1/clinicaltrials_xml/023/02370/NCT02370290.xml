	<brief_summary>This pilot research trial study quantitative image metric derive contrast enhance compute tomography ( CECT ) enhance assessment disease status patient kidney cancer . Quantitative image extraction quantifiable feature radiological image assessment disease status . Collecting quantitative imaging metric CECT imaging may help doctor predict tumor aggressiveness nuclear grade ( tumor stage ) ass treatment response prognosis cancer imaging .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate role quantitative imaging metric ( QIM ) potential DIAGNOSTIC biomarker . II . To investigate QIM parameter differentiate clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) papillary RCC . III . To evaluate tumor grade target lesion assess QIM CECT agreement pathological ( Fuhrman ) grade . IV . To investigate role QIM potential PROGNOSTIC biomarker . V. To develop novel method calculate renal tumor contact surface area ( CSA ) use advanced image-processing technology ( MATLABÂ® , 3 dimension [ D ] Synapse ) predict peri-operative variable blood loss , operative time post-operative estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) patient undergo partial nephrectomy ( PN ) . VI . To develop QIM would help predict postoperative functional outcome predict surgically resected volume postoperative glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . OUTLINE : Patients ' clinical imaging data collect routine multiphase CECT imaging use establish validate classification/prediction rule QIM .</detailed_description>
