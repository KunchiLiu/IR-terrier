	<brief_title>Berry Intake - Effects Systemic Oral Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Summary About 10-15 % adult population Sweden suffers periodontitis , inflammatory response certain oral bacteria . The first stage periodontitis term gingivitis , clinically define swollen tissue , redness bleed gingiva . If inflammatory process could attenuate , would greatly reduce risk develop periodontitis . Diet importance development prevention chronic disease . Berries contain compound act anti-inflammatory agent bioactivity may reduce risk disease . A recent meta-analysis publication area reveal dearth experimental clinical data impact berry intake inflammatory condition . Studies detail berry intake/dosage period dosage exert effect particularly lacking , term positive effect berry anti-inflammatory condition . The purpose project : - Demonstrate impact daily intake freeze-dried berry clinical degree chronic inflammation study change degree gingivitis . - To study presence pro- anti-inflammatory marker locally gingival tissue , saliva analysis serum sample . - To analyze dose response relationship different berry powder investigate clinical biomedical effect . Background Many disease significant inflammatory pathogenesis difficult control . In traditional medicine symptom inflammatory process treat pharmaceutical . Many pharmaceutical show side-effects economic environmental consequence individual environment . It centuries know plant anti-inflammatory healing effect . An early example plant come use medical treatment work Carl von Linné practice botanist physician . In modern time complimentary alternative medicine claim intake fruit berry different composition anti-inflammatory effect . Some claim difficult evaluate since study highlight anti-inflammatory benefit often well conduct . There conspicuous lack data clinically effective dos plant extract . The Swedish National Food Agency contend daily intake vegetable , fruit berry 500 gram adult , although people Sweden reach recommendation . Fruits berry consider pharmaceutical often term 'nutraceuticals ' . Despite lack scientific ground medicinal use fruit berry , today large range health product base fruit berry . It , therefore , importance scientifically investigate fruit berry demonstrable anti-inflammatory effect specifically study biomarkers clinical condition adult individual . It also vital develop palatable form administration berry would facilitate regular intake naturally base product . Using biomedicine start point aim study anti-inflammatory effect clinical , randomize , case control , study . Our primary objective treat adult individual gingivitis . In general , gingivitis make common chronic condition adult occur half population . From clinical perspective well establish method investigate inflammation mouth . The presence inflammatory biomarkers mouth conveniently efficiently measure . Through standard method blood sample one study inflammatory biomarkers thus analyze general effect intake test product may . Method A daily intake 500 g difficult achieve . Freeze-dried berry powder distribution form would enable regular intake naturally base product . We intend investigate dose-response relationship different berry , bilberry , black currant , lingonberry , rise hip , sea buckthorn . The selection berry base accessibility , assume acceptance variation nutrient commercial condition . Our early study bilberry use reference . All berry powder use study analyze sugar content micronutrient . We analyze clinical effect degree gingivitis change know biomarkers inflammation serum , saliva gingival fluid . We start low dose double dose week . We make assumption content dry substance berry 10 % , i.e . 50 g freeze-dried berry would correspond 500 g fresh berry . We start 6.25 g berry powder double dosage week reach maximum dosage 50 g accord Swedish National Food Agencies recommendation . The clinical investigation include routine dental examination assess probe depth teeth , extent gingival bleeding , presence plaque accumulation teeth . Serum , saliva , gingival fluid sample collect assess bacteria cytokine level . The dental nurse conduct clinical investigation information whether participate individual assign berry powder placebo . Placebo consist potato starch . The clinical biomedical parameter study weekly seven day time required assure clinical effect assume sufficient reach steady-state level marker inflammation . The aim identify dose-response relationship rank effect different berry . The examination biomarkers base Luminex Technology . The Luminex system enable analysis combination marker inflammation small sample volume . Our experience pilot study show order obtain statistical power VEGF MIP-1α 16 individual require . We plan include 20 individual series compensate individual n't complete study . Inclusion criterion registration lingual bleeding first second molar lower jaw .</detailed_description>
