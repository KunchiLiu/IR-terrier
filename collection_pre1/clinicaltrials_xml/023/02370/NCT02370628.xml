	<brief_title>Vertebroplasty In The Treatment Of Acute Fracture Trial - The VITTA Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vertebroplasty procedure use stabilize broken vertebra , bone form spine . This study evaluate effectiveness vertebroplasty treatment acute vertebral fracture . The VITTA trial randomize , control , single-blinded , cross-over trial compare percutaneous vertebroplasty facet block patient acute ( &lt; 1 month ) painful vertebral compression fracture . Vertebral compression fracture ( VCFs ) frequently result debilitate pain , impair functional status bad quality life . Percutaneous vertebroplasty ( PV ) treatment VCFs originally develop France late 1980s first perform America mid-1990s . The procedure involve percutaneous application bone cement ( polymethylmethacrylate ) collapse vertebra . VCFs significant public health problem approximately 750,000 new fracture occur United States year , number project rise population age . In fact , one quarter adult age 50 suffer least one VCF lifetime . VCFs cause short term occasionally long-term pain disability , although immediately life threatening , associate long term mortality . Before advent PV , treatment VCFs limit medical therapy- addressing pain associated fracture fracture thus make VCFs practically skeletal fracture treat orthopedic surgery . Since introduction vertebroplasty , 800 paper , technical note , review address technique publish overwhelming majority reporting significant pain relief advocate adoption procedure common practice . Unfortunately , study low evidence level poor scientific design randomize clinical trial publish 2009 . Vertebroplasty refractory back pain ( period conservative management 1 month ) constitute main indication overwhelm majority study publish far . Although study largely suggest offer significant improvement pain functional status relative medical therapy infusion local anesthesia acute phase , data remains inconclusive poor scientific quality . The present study propose different rationale : benefit vertebroplasty may occur acute phase ( 1 month ) provide immediate pain relief patient , hence allow early mobilization prevent medical complication associate bed rest . In term , vertebroplasty may first line , acute phase treatment . If investigator hypothesis hold true , adequately power clinical trial may provide sufficient evidence change medical indication vertebroplasty .</detailed_description>
