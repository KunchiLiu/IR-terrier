	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study type ultrasound call robot-assisted laparoscopic high-intensity focus ultrasound perform thermal ablative therapy , sound wave therapy , treat patient small kidney mass undergo partial removal kidney . The robot-assisted ultrasound probe take image kidney help doctor locate mass . The probe use high frequency sound wave target ablate ( destroy ) kidney mass , may cancerous tumor benign tissue . Surgery perform remove part kidney mass . Robot-assisted laparoscopic high-intensity focus ultrasound thermal ablative therapy may safer help doctor see tumor well perform kidney surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy laparoscopic high-intensity focus ultrasound ( HIFU ) treatment localize primary renal cancer evaluate histological accuracy successful ablation small renal mass , match intraoperative targeting . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety toxicity laparoscopic HIFU patient primary renal cancer . II . To evaluate technical success laparoscopic HIFU ablation . OUTLINE : Patients undergo robot-assisted laparoscopic HIFU thermal ablative therapy partial nephrectomy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 day , 2 week , 1 month , 6 month , 12 month , annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
