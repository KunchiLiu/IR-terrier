	<brief_title>An ^11CT-773 Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Study Determine Phosphodiesterase10A Occupancy TAK-063</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-063 . TAK-063 tested estimate phosphodiesterase10A ( PDE10A ) occupancy brain follow single dose TAK-063 . This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan look change volume tissue distribution TAK-063 administration calculate PDE10A occupancy brain . The study enrol 13 participant . Participants assign treatment group base enrollment schedule . The first 4 participant assign Pilot Cohort receive one dose TAK-063 30 mg 1000 mg tablet . The remain participant enrol Main Cohort receive one dose TAK-063 3 , 10 , 30 100 mg . Participants cohort also receive 3 separate intravenous infusion [ ^11C ] T-773 &lt; 8 μg ; 400MBq ± 10 % follow PET scan . This single-centre trial conduct Sweden . The overall time participate study 46 day . Participants make 3 visit clinic , include one 3-day period confinement clinic . Participants contact phone Day 16 follow-up safety assessment .</detailed_description>
