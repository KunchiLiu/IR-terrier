	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common joint disease affect 1 10 Canadians . Osteoarthritis commonly present knee joint associate mobility limitation , pain , increase risk chronic health condition heart disease . It critical implement exercise people knee OA effective method improve pain , mobility , cardiovascular health . A biomechanical exercise program use static yoga posture establish investigator lab base minimize damage knee joint load , effectively exercise musculature around knee joint . The investigator pilot project ( REB # 13-510 ) show 12-week yoga program use biomechanical exercise improve pain mobility keep medial joint load well experience normal level walking . The next step exercise program compare clinical tissue outcomes regularly prescribe aerobic strengthen program , well control group complete meditation class . The investigator aim identify difference clinical mobility performance outcome , muscle fat volume use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , cartilage integrity use MRI three group use randomize control trial ( RCT ) design .</detailed_description>
