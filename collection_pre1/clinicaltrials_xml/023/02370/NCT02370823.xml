	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine level proteins and/or cellular component synovial fluid indicative microenvironment phenotype osteoarthritic knee compare unilateral unaffected joint pre-injection 6 week post-Regenexx SD treatment ( day 0 ) . Secondary objective evaluation possible direct and/or indirect association measure level protein and/or cellular component synovial fluid osteoarthritic knee joint administration Regenexx SD treatment . The secondary objective include MRI evidence cartilage repair ; incidence post-operative complication , adverse event , re-injections , surgical intervention ; change pain score use pain medication .</detailed_description>
