	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study questionnaires identify arm , shoulder , neck ( upper extremity ) function quality life treatment patient breast cancer . Patients may experience arm , shoulder , neck impairment negatively affect function quality life cancer-related treatment . Studying upper extremity function quality life patient breast cancer treatment may help doctor determine prevalence severity long-term functional impairment relationship perception impairment due breast cancer treatment ' impact quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Questionnaires Identifying Upper Extremity Function Quality Life After Treatment Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize patient ' upper extremity functionality ( use Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand [ DASH ] questionnaire ) perception quality life ( use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Breast [ FACT-B ] questionnaire ) one ten year breast cancer surgery compare general population . II . To investigate whether patient ' upper extremity functionality perception quality life completion breast cancer treatment change duration time 1 -10 year breast cancer surgery . III . To characterize patient perception impact breast cancer quality life relation current upper-extremity functionality 1-10 year breast cancer surgery . IV . To characterize patient ' upper extremity functionality ( use DASH questionnaire ) perception impact breast cancer quality life ( use FACT-B questionnaire ) sub group individual stable metastatic breast cancer 1-10 year initial diagnosis surgery . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assist multidisciplinary team identify musculoskeletal barrier ( ) impact patient 's long-term recovery respect breast cancer treatment receive . II . To assist develop implement physical therapy component within Personalized Medicine Breast Cancer Care Plan ; include early detection potential physical barrier , physical therapy intervention model , development survivorship plan cancer-related musculoskeletal impairment . OUTLINE : Patients complete DASH FACT-B questionnaires 30-45 minute .</detailed_description>
