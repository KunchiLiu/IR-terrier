	<detailed_description>670 nm energy form red light dilates isolate blood vessel . This study seek measure vessel dilation human subject expose energy different irradiance intensity ( 25 milliwatt ( mW ) /cm2 75 mW/cm2 ) . The intent protocol measure blood flow gastrocnemius muscle exposure 670 nm light energy . This protocol perform healthy subject , meet exclusion criterion . The study consist one visit . Blood flow measurement perform use contrast enhance ultrasound , method ultrasound contrast continuously infuse blood stream . Ultrasound record image area interest flow relate intensity contrast image . After baseline blood flow image collect , subject receive red light energy gastrocnemius muscle concurrent blood flow measurement contrast ultrasound . The subject monitor post procedure study complete .</detailed_description>
