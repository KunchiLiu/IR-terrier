	<brief_title>Flexibility Strength Training Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment symptomatic asthma currently focus use medication - inhale systemic - principal goal relieve airway pathology , namely airway narrowing , inflammation , mucus metaplasia hyper-reactivity . There therapy direct chest wall connective tissue structural unit , include connective tissue matrix , bone health chest wall musculature . Resistive flexibility strength training ( RFST ) new physical therapy technique successfully address abnormality upper low extremity back . In application , propose use internal funding pilot project explore potential holistic benefit RFST direct chest wall symptomatic asthmatic well potential mechanical basis therapeutic benefit observe . In RFST , practitioner extends flexes joint , patient actively resist motion apply practitioner . In word , patient performs eccentric contraction extensor muscle joint flexed , flexor muscle joint extend . The technique base follow theoretical principle : - Opposing muscle pair ( i.e . ipsilateral flexor/extensor ) become dysfunctional connective tissue within one muscle ( either flexor extensor ) become chronically shortened—thought due long-standing exaggerate centrally drive tonic muscle activity either follow injury due posture habit . When happen , connective tissue within oppose muscle become chronically lengthened due shortening paired muscle . - The connective tissue become inelastic restrictive result muscle hold chronically short lengthen position . These position change . - In trunk , imbalance occur flexor/extensor group ( e.g . psoas/multifidus ) also right/left muscle pair , create postural asymmetry . For example , shorten psoas muscle one side lead lengthen psoas contralateral side . - Shortening limb girdle muscle ( e.g . pectoralis , gluteus ) create complex imbalance pattern across local flexor/extensor pair , across side , diagonally across trunk ( e.g . shorten pectoralis major one side cause lengthen extensor muscle contralateral hip ) . - The end result imbalance shorten muscle restrict range movement , lengthen muscle function optimally lengthen position . It think resistance stretch 1 ) allows shorten muscle lengthen lengthen muscle shorten remodel intramuscular perimuscular connective tissue , 2 ) allows lengthen muscle contract favorable length 3 ) allow increase flexion , extension , flexibility joint range motion .</detailed_description>
