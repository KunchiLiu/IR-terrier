	<brief_summary>Low dose rate brachytherapy use iodine 125 well establish treatment low intermediate risk prostate cancer . Currently uncertainty safety technique patient previous transurethral resection prostate gland ( TURP ) obstruction urine flow prostatic urethra . Early experience technique develop 1980s suggest high incidence urinary incontinence brachytherapy previous TURP . It however clear increase experience many centre offer treatment patient previous TURP , use various parameter select patient include time TURP persence absence significant cavity within gland MRI scanning . There systematic study I125 brachytherapy TURP current era might address inform practice future patient . Hence study design formally assess safety I125 brachytherapy previous TURP .</brief_summary>
