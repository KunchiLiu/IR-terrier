	<brief_title>Biomarkers Post Thrombotic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) problem develop nearly half patient experience deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) low limb . PTS symptom include chronic leg pain , swell , redness , skin ulcer . PTS lower patient ' quality life DVT , specifically regard physical psychological symptom limitation daily activity . Secondly , treatment PTS add significantly cost treat DVT . PTS also cause lost work productivity : patient severe PTS venous ulcer lose 2 work day per year Nowadays , effective measure reduce significatively PTS onset follow DVT episode . Biomarkers use explore etiology well develop risk stratification tool PTS . The relationship PTS specific biomarkers may help guide prevention therapy base patient 's individual risk profile . Recent study show MMPs play significant role vascular remodel endothelial dysfunction may explain role aneurysm formation well clinical manifestation venous disease ( acute chronic related event ) cellular molecular mechanism involve thrombus resolution vein wall fibrosis remain undefined . The presence MMPs TIMPs acute venous occlusion model suggest important early interplay protease inhibitor event precede development venous disease . This study aim deepen investigator knowledge PTS MMPs ( related molecule NGAL cytokine ) find predictive molecular system well classify risk patient develop PTS DVT episode , order monitorate strictly patient high risk develop complication . Patients recruit first episode DVT follow accord standard protocol DVT 1,4,8,12,24 , 36 month . At visit blood sample collect venipuncture order evaluate MMPs ( related molecule ) plasma level . These data relate clinical finding .</detailed_description>
