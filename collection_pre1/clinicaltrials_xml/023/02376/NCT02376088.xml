	<brief_summary>Patients GD often present glucose dysregulation , , accord study , associate islet β-cell dysfunction , enhance gluconeogenesis insulin resistance ( IR ) . Current study focus mainly IR , investigate islet β-cell function show inconsistent result . This study examine characteristic glucose dysregulation Chinese patient GD , furthermore evaluated effect thyroid dysfunction islet β-cell function subsequently carbohydrate metabolism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characteristics Islet β-cell Functions Chinese Patients With Graves ' Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thyroid dysfunction closely associate glucoregulation . Carbohydrate metabolism affect decreased level thyroid hormone ( TH ) , even elevate TH level . Epidemiological data show 2 % -57 % patient Graves ' Disease ( GD ) present glucose dysregulation , might also relate change islet β-cell function patient GD . The incidence GD comparable variation geographically , possibly different underlie mechanism , excessive intake iodine result aggravation autoimmune reaction thyroid consequently increment incidence GD . The might also true glucoregulation islet β-cell function patient GD . This study aim examine characteristic glucoregulation islet β-cell function patient GD different area China , use early-phase insulin secretion index ( △I30/△G30 ) , glucose area curve ( GAUC ) insulin area curve ( INSAUC ) .</detailed_description>
