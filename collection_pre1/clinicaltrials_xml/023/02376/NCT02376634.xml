	<detailed_description>Participants 60 child , age 10-21 , ASA 1 2 Classification , idiopathic scoliosis congenital deformity chest wall , undergo Nuss procedure/scoliosis repair Nationwide Children 's hospital . The design study single-blinded randomize controlled trial-comparing pre-operative anxiety , post-operative pain relate symptom two group : Group 1 : Receives hypnosis ( describe ) Plus PCA Group 2 : Standard care ( PCA ) Interventions : Group I ) Hypnosis : The hypnosis group receive semi-structured intervention primary investigator . The intervention somewhat individualize base recipient personal characteristic ( e.g. , age , gender , medical history ) . The intervention begin `` induction '' phase participant guide relax focus attention one stimulus . The intervention proceed `` suggestion '' phase . Suggestions use phase direct toward decrease patient 's anxiety post-operative pain . Patients teach self-hypnosis decrease distress reframe painful experience . Group II ) Control : This group receive standard care Nationwide Children 's hospital . Procedures : 1 . Potential participant identify review NCH surgery schedule assess eligibility review electronic medical record use exclusionary criterion list . 2 . In order assure valid data , anesthetic protocol standardize . 3 . All patient randomize Hypnosis group control group another member research team base randomization table . The patient 's group assignment place seal envelope prior day surgery . Only PI access envelope prior intervention . The PI perform assign intervention research assistant health care provider present . The research assistant peri-operative health care personnel remain blind group assignment throughout data collection . 4 . A research assistant administer brief assessment state anxiety ( STAI ) take patient 5 minute complete . 5 . The research assistant measure patient 's blood pressure ( BP ) heart rate ( HR ) . 6 . The PI perform clinical hypnotherapy intervention teach self-hypnosis two point time Hypnosis group ; 1 . In pre-op visit prior surgery date 2. day , prior procedure 7 . A second research assistant administer second brief assessment anxiety ( STAI ) , measure HR BP . 8 . Once patient enters operate room standardize anesthetic protocol ( describe ) employ . 9 . Following surgery , Post Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) floor standardize pain management PCA order . 10 . Postoperative analgesia provide hydromorphone deliver via patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) device bolus dose 4-8 µg/kg lockout period 8-10 minute . This may increase 10 µg/kg need achieve optimal analgesia . No basal infusion administer PCA . The nursing staff post-anesthesia recovery unit study staff collect post-operative pain score 24 hour post-operatively blind group assign . The subject 's pain score collect record use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) pain scale . Total opiate consumption first 24 hour record . The need medication treat opiate-related side effect include naloxone ondansetron pruritus nausea respectively record . We record number delivery demand PCA device . We also record length hospital stay . Measures - State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) 15 . The STAI , complete patient chart anxiety level , 40-item self-report measure contain 20 item measure state anxiety 20 item measure trait anxiety . Subjects ask respond 4-point Likert scale . Total score state trait portion separately range 20 80 , high score denote high level anxiety . - Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) The VAS complete blind observer chart rating patient 's pain . It 10cm line observer mark line anywhere `` anxious '' `` anxious '' - McGill Pain Questionnaire ( MPQ ) . Sensory effective dimension pain measure use short MPQ , consist 15 pain descriptor rat 4-point severity scale 0 ( none ) 3 ( severe ) . - Analgesic consumption . Analgesic consumption measure record analgesic administer study subject . - Clinical recovery . Postoperative parameter record include time clear fluid intake , void , discharge hospital . The incidence post-operative complication , post-operative nausea vomit post-operative infection , note well . - Global health questionnaire ( GHQ ) . The GHQ use assess post-operative recovery ; item include sleep , strength energy , self-assistance movement . The subject rate every item six point Likert scale . The individual rating sum total recovery score .</detailed_description>
