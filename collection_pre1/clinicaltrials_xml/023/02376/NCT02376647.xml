	<brief_title>ART-3 Pilot - Driving Pressure Limited Ventilation Patients Without ARDS ( ART3pilot )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanical ventilation potential produce worsen alveolar injury . Driving pressure difference plateau pressure PEEP . Evidence observational study suggest elevate driving pressure main independent determinant ventilator-induced lung injury , however clinical trial need establish whether target low driving pressure improve clinical outcome patient without acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . Thus , ART-3 pilot multicenter randomize control trial ass feasibility driving pressure limit mechanical ventilation strategy compare conventional strategy patient without ARDS . Patients consider trial mechanical ventilation le 72 hour without diagnosis ARDS . We exclude patient le 18 year old ; contraindication hypercapnia intracranial hypertension recent acute coronary syndrome ; patient high probability death within 24 hour anticipated patient exclusive palliative care . Eligible patient randomize driving pressure limit ventilation strategy conventional strategy ( tidal volume 8 mL/kg predict body weight ) . The primary outcome driving pressure day 1 3 .</detailed_description>
