	<detailed_description>Study Background Glaucoma world ' lead cause irreversible blindness nearly 7 million bilaterally blind due disease , estimate , , represent disease significant associate morbidity . Furthermore , glaucoma primarily disease old age , number elderly people world continue rise , number people glaucoma blindness likely increase economic burden public health cost . Primary glaucoma classify 2 type , Primary Open Angle Glaucoma ( POAG ) Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma ( PACG ) . Classification depend configuration anterior chamber drainage angle , specifically open show evidence closure . The proportion people POAG PACG approximately equal , latter disease common Asians woman . Although result disease progressive cup optic disc correspond visual field loss , mechanism occurs think quite different two disease . In POAG mechanism still establish PACG think apposition peripheral iris drainage angle result damage trabecular meshwork ( TM ) formation peripheral anterior synaechiae ( PAS ) act mechanical obstruction aqueous outflow via trabecular meshwork . This turn result raise intraocular pressure ( IOP ) subsequent optic nerve damage . Apposition occur anatomically predispose eye , although physiological dynamic element likely involve also . Areas TM obstruct PAS likely retain function , although clear level normal subject . The function TM posterior area PAS also yet establish hope study help elucidate matter . Conventional initial management PACG perform laser peripheral iridotomy ( LPI ) allow flow aqueous posterior chamber anterior chamber iatrogenically create iridotomy . This two benefit - subject pupillary-block thought mechanism angle closure , reduce risk acute rise IOP occurring ( acute angle closure ) . In subject PAC , LPI show increase drainage angle lead lower IOP subject . However , retrospective review 65 subject PACG LPI , 5 year follow-up vast majority require intervention ( medication and/or surgery ) low IOP . Furthermore , PAS formation show still occur presence patent PI . Clearly , current conventional management strategy PAC/PACG inadequate likely lead ocular morbidity . The poor result LPI long-term subject PACG term IOP control lead many clinician study effect cataract surgery IOP control patient . It think remove lens would increase anterior chamber depth increase drainage angle hence increase outflow . Cataract surgery indeed seem open drainage angle effect IOP control promising . However , open drainage angle may limited subject significant PAS . This could compromise IOP lower effect cataract surgery group patient . In case , cataract surgery mechanical breaking PAS ( i.e . goniosynechialysis ) might lower IOP great extent cataract surgery alone . Phacoemulsification + intraocular lens + Goniosynechialysis ( PEI-GSL ) carry several publish study , study report reduction post-operative IOP compare pre-operative . The main complication associate PEI-GSL excessive post-operative anterior chamber fibrinous reaction anterior chamber bleeding . Theoretically , excessive pressure break PAS could also cause iridodialysis cyclodialysis , resultant ocular hypotony . In effort reduce complication risk , Varma Fraser describe phacoemulsification + intraocular lens + viscogonioplasty ( PEI-VGP ) viscoelastic use break PAS non-iris contact method , rather use instrument push iris back . The author propose procedure would reduce complication PEI-GSL still open angle sufficiently . It clear however , PEI-VGP would provide sufficient force open area PAS therefore efficacious PEI-GSL lowering IOP . Furthermore , evidence either PEI-GSL PEI-VGP superior phacoemulsification + intraocular lens ( PEI ) alone reduce IOP . Most surgeon perform cataract surgery patient PAC/PACG uncontrolled IOP . By add relatively simple step goniosynechialysis surgical procedure , propose result IOP lower hence less risk glaucoma development/progression . This yet prove . An alternative treatment modality subject PAC/PACG , visually significant cataract high IOP , would perform phaco-trabeculectomy . Two recent randomize controlled trial publish Tham co-worker , compare PEI versus phaco-IOL-trabeculectomy subject medically control medically uncontrolled angle-closure glaucoma . For medically control group , clinically significant difference IOP lower effect two surgical modality . For medically uncontrolled group , modality reduce IOP phaco-IOL-trabeculectomy group significantly low IOP . However , phaco-IOL-trabeculectomy group study significantly high complication rate PEI group . Furthermore , 4/27 ( 14.8 % ) eye PEI group ( medically uncontrolled IOP study ) require subsequent trabeculectomy control IOP 2 year follow period . In 4 case , trabeculectomy carry successfully . Extrapolating data would appear although phaco-trabeculectomy low IOP PEI patient medically uncontrolled angle-closure glaucoma , many patient would require 2 combine simultaneous procedure . Furthermore , trabeculectomy surgery significant complication rate , even many year surgery perform . Performing either PEI , PEI-GSL ( without viscoelastic assistance ) would likely result significant reduction IOP still leave open option trabeculectomy ( glaucoma drainage device surgery ) later conjunctiva sclera would untouched . This multicentre study design determine 2 surgical option would superior term efficacy complication . There randomize control trial compare PEI versus PEI-GSL ( PEI-VGP ) . There several case series summarize . Effect phacoemulsification + intraocular lens intraocular pressure subject primary angle closure In patient PAC PACG , considerable evidence PEI lower IOP . Hayashi coworkers , prospective study 77 eye 77 consecutive patient PACG find IOP decrease significantly baseline average 6.1 ± 3.9 mmHg 1 year follow up.5 Tham co-worker show even considerable decrease IOP pre-operative mean 24.4 mmHg mean 15.4 mmHg 15 month cohort 27 patient medically uncontrolled PACG.13 The group examine effect PEI cohort 35 eye medically control PACG.14 Pooling result study , PEI significantly reduce IOP pre-operative mean 20.4 ± 5.8 mmHg mean 14.6 ± 2.9 mmHg 1 year , irrespective pre-operative IOP control . Effect phacoemulsification + intraocular lens + goniosynechialysis intraocular pressure subject primary angle closure The large case series topic , prospective study perform PEI-GSL perform Teekhasaenee coworkers . Fifty-two eye 48 patient ( Thailand ) PACG underwent laser peripheral iridotomy continue raise IOP define IOP &gt; 21 mmHg . Subjects underwent PEI-GSL IOP decrease pre-operative mean 29.7 ± 7.9 mmHg 13.2 ± 2.9 mmHg final examination ( mean follow 20.8 ± 15.5 month , range 5-76 month ) . This mean decrease 16.5 mmHg . There 2 study effect PEI-VGP IOP control , retrospective case series . In first , consecutive series 15 eyes patient refractory PACG , PEI-VGP reduce IOP significantly 27.4 mmHg ( medication ) 14.1 mmHg ( medication 14/15 eye ) , 6 months.13 This represent decrease 13.3 mmHg . A subsequent study 11 patient ( 11 eye ) subject PACG ( refractory control despite patent peripheral iridotomy ) show decrease IOP 39.4 mmHg pre-operatively mean 13.4 mmHg PEI-VGP 7.8 month follow . Effect phacoemulsification + intraocular lens alone phacoemulsification + intraocular lens + goniosynechialysis angle open subject primary angle closure There several study show drainage angle open significantly PEI subject PAC/G.17 ; 18 Only one paper describe effect PEI extent peripheral anterior synaechiae . This show subject PACG PAS , significant reduction extent PAS PEI , approximately 25 % .8 Most study PEI-GSL also describe opening drainage angle subject PAC/G .
