	<brief_summary>Clinical trial critical informing care patient cancer . However , 3-5 % patient cancer enroll clinical trial . Poor accrual trial major implication regard pace progress , cost clinical cancer research , generalizability result . The investigator recently show analysis 7,776 cancer clinical trial register clinicaltrials.gov approximately 20 % cancer clinical trial fail complete enrollment ; often cite reason poor accrual . Prior research identify barrier cancer clinical trial accrual generally categorize domain availability , awareness , acceptance . Much attention pay barrier involvement awareness acceptance - however , trial availability likely `` rate limiting step '' . This pilot study first series plan step attempt shift current paradigm `` bringing patient trial '' `` bringing trial patient . '' With integration telemedicine visit , investigator aim decrease burden participation patient , begin address geographic barrier , ultimately improve trial accrual . In study , men biochemically recurrent prostate cancer ( rise PSA definitive local therapy ) receive antidiabetic drug , metformin . Patients require single on-site visit study enrollment . The remainder 6 month study conduct via HIPPA secure telemonitoring system ( monthly visit conduct via telemedicine tablet computer provide patient ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin Rising PSA Remote Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Men isolate PSA recurrence local therapy ideal population evaluation novel therapy give minimal disease burden , generally indolent natural history , patient ' preference avoid adverse effect androgen deprivation therapy . Metformin show anti-prostate cancer activity preclinical model cohort study . Metformin , biguanide oral antihyperglycemic agent , abrogate hyperinsulinemia individual without diabetes show promising anti-prostate cancer activity preclinical model , epidemiologic study , retrospective cohort . Several epidemiologic/retrospective study show metformin positive impact overall survival among men prostate cancer . These nonclinical clinical study lead call prospective study metformin patient prostate cancer . This pilot telemedicine study metformin patient rise PSA ( `` biochemical recurrence '' ) definitive local therapy prostate cancer . The current study support follow rationale : - A large proportion clinical trial close prematurely due poor accrual . - Geographic inaccessibility barrier clinical trial participation . - Metformin safe inexpensive medication demonstrate anti-prostate cancer activity nonclinical epidemiologic study . Importantly , metformin show safe non-diabetic patient ( e.g. , patient polycystic ovary disease ) cause hypoglycemia . - Use novel technology may facilitate clinical trial accrual minimize burden participation patient . Ultimately , approach may also decrease cost drug development increase pace progress . In absence prohibitive toxicity disease progression ( defined 4.4 ) , patient may continue treatment 6-month study period . This study include baseline visit study enrollment Mount Sinai . The remainder visit telemedicine visit conduct use secure video conferencing .</detailed_description>
