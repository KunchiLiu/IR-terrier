	<detailed_description>Primary Biliary Cirrhosis ( PBC ) liver disease predominantly affect female , present first time age , develop many year . It cause immune system attack body 's tissue . People PBC frequently experience profound fatigue tiredness liken `` battery run '' , although people still want undertake normal activity simply lack energy able . This reduce quality life , make difficult people work , end become isolate community . At present treatment fatigue PBC . Finding treatment fatigue PBC one high research priority identify patient group . We show PBC patient fatigue abnormality way generate energy within muscle . This appear associated presence antibody blood direct important protein normal cell body use generate energy . In recent year new drug treatment develop allow u safely suppress part immune system produce antibody type seem cause energy production problem PBC . As yet , however , extent medicine improve fatigue removal antibody PBC test . The aim study undertake clinical trial examine effect treatment ( `` Rituximab '' ) severe fatigue PBC help u understand whether potentially useful treatment . This give u information energy generation change patient PBC also help u develop new treatment fatigue disease . The study potential improve quality life many patient PBC , currently license treatment . We perform randomise controlled trial Rituximab therapy PBC compare placebo primary end point fatigue severity . The study perform specialised PBC clinical centre . Our hypothesis B-cell-directed immunotherapeutic agent Rituximab improve fatigue PBC ( important disable symptom ) effect B-cells produce antibody inhibit function pyruvate dehydrogenase ( PDH ) important energy generate enzyme . Fatigue common debilitate symptom frequently impact significantly quality life ability function patient PBC . There currently effective treatment fatigue PBC new approach urgently require address unmet need . Rituximab , B-cell deplete agent , hold specific promise ( evidence small-scale proof-of-concept pilot trial ) therapy fatigue PBC , give strong evidence link antibody response PDH pathogenesis fatigue disease . We also believe , give robust diagnostic criterion availability validate clinical tool , PBC important useful human model study pathogenesis treatment fatigue . There currently treatment fatigue PBC aware treatment evaluation . A pilot study perform Canada explore use Rituximab PBC ( 13 patient ) provide proof-of-concept , show agent safe well-tolerated patient , associate clinically significant reduction fatigue . Fatigue severity assess use Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) ( potential range 9-63 point ) fall see pre-treatment ( median FSS=36 , range 11-59 ) post-treatment ( median=29 , range 12-55 ) . Taking account floor value FSS , represent median fall fatigue severity 6 month 26 % . This compare case-control study fatigue PBC suggest fatigue severity age sex match normal control 30 % low PBC patients1 suggest potential Rituximab therapy return PBC patient close normal regard perceive fatigue . However , pilot study attempt explore mechanism effect , since use severe fatigue inclusion criterion , extent possible improvement patient unclear ; moreover , study optimise study fatigue ( fatigue secondary outcome patient participate fatigue potentially under-estimating clinical effect ) . Patients show sustained reduction anti-PDH antibody level isotypes , support concept Rituximab beneficial effect fatigue depletion PDH-reactive antibody . The importance severe fatigue PBC current lack treatment , strong theoretical basis approach , supportive pilot trial proof-of-concept data , believe , justify formal clinical trial Rituximab target fatigue PBC . Data animal model PBC implicate activate B-cells promote autoreactivity , human vitro study show increased TLR-mediated B-cell activation PBC , human genetic study show disease association loci implicate regulation B-cell pool size pilot trial data show improvement liver biochemistry PBC patient treat Rituximab point potential additional , generic benefit treatment term underlie liver inflammation justify substantive clinical trial PBC .</detailed_description>
