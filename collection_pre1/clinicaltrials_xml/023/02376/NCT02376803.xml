	<brief_summary>Warfarin anticoagulant medication highly effective prevent clot disorder narrow therapeutic window . If warfarin effective patient risk stroke , effective patient risk bleed complication . Physicians routinely regularly measure blood test ( call `` INR '' ) determine effectiveness warfarin range test value ( `` therapeutic range '' ) try keep patient . By convention warfarin take dinnertime , however time day highly variable consumption dietary vitamin K occur ( find largely green leafy vegetable ) vitamin K alters effectiveness warfarin . Given vitamin K short half-life ( i.e . active short period time ingest ) may make sense take warfarin morning ( little vitamin K ingest ) produce consistent drug effect . The purpose study determine whether switch current warfarin user even morning dose decrease time spend outside therapeutic INR range .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background WARFARIN AND THE MONITORING OF ANTICOAGULATION THERAPY : Warfarin , oral anticoagulant medication disrupts vitamin K 's ability activate clot factor liver , strong evidence efficacy prevention thromboembolic disease ( notably set atrial fibrillation , mechanical heart valves venous thromboembolism ) . However , also narrow therapeutic range many drug / disease interaction - risk clot disorder meant prevent ( e.g . stroke , pulmonary embolism ) `` anticoagulated '' risk major bleed side effect `` anticoagulated '' . For reason warfarin user routinely undergo regular blood test measure time take blood clot standardize setting compare population average . This test commonly refer `` INR '' ( International Normalized Ratio ) patient commonly blood test measure every 1 4 week same-day decision warfarin dose adjustment make general practitioner ( GP ) base day 's INR result . For atrial fibrillation venous thromboembolism target INR range usually 2.0 3.0 ( i.e . take 2 3 time longer patient 's blood clot warfarin ) . For mechanical heart valve , risk stroke high , target range usually 2.5 3.5 . Unfortunately patient highly variable INR test proportion time spend therapeutic range ( `` TTR '' ) relatively low . This reduce effectiveness therapy ( INR low ) put patient risk potentially life threaten bleeding ( INR high ) . The overall average TTR community setting publish literature 56.7 % [ 95 % CI 51.5-62.0 % ] , consider suboptimal . `` Good control '' describe TTR &gt; 75 % new alternative anticoagulation strategy recommend TTR &lt; 60 % . THE INFLUENCE OF VITAMIN K ON WARFARIN THERAPY : Vitamin K , plant use process photosynthesis , find largely green leafy vegetable ( notably kale , spinach , broccoli , lettuce Brussels sprout ) . It essential cofactor use liver `` activate '' clot factor release blood . Vitamin K short half-life body ( approximately 2 ½ hour ) cycle active ( far ability `` activate '' clot factor ) inactive form liver . Warfarin act prevent one intermediary step necessary convert inactive form vitamin K back active form hence reduces amount available activate clot factor . When vitamin K first ingest , however , easily activate form upon warfarin little effect . As result , consumption high vitamin K contain food counteract effect warfarin highly variable consumption food may cause clinically important INR variability individual . Most typically , low vitamin K contain food consume morning , highly variable vitamin K contain meal consume dinner . THE POTENTIAL INFLUENCE OF THE TIMING OF WARFARIN INGESTION ON ANTICOAGULATION THERAPY : Warfarin long half-life ( 36 42 hour ) , result , generally assume clinician time day ingest impact efficacy . Although patient take morning , commonly warfarin take dinnertime ( later even ) result INR test communicate patient time dose adjustment ( ) day . However warfarin act liver immediately follow ingestion ( case ingest substance ) ALL ingest warfarin deliver directly liver portal blood . Conceivably , warfarin transition liver first , could important `` first pas effect '' would make warfarin activity great around time ingest ( comparison hour later drug distribute throughout rest body ) . To date , possibility never explore . If first pas effect exist , conceivable ingest warfarin dinner ( time ingestion day 's large highly variable amount easily activate vitamin K ) , may induce undesirable variability might period great warfarin activity . Given vitamin K short half-life , take warfarin morning ( one would expect consistently low vitamin K activity ) may produce consistent first pas effect ( one exist ) , stable INR result . Hypotheses A ) Morning , compare evening , administration warfarin produce consistent anticoagulant effect improve proportion time patient spends target therapeutic INR range . B ) A less variable daily ( opposed weekly ) dietary vitamin K consumption dinner , whether consistently high consistently low , reduce variability anticoagulant effect warfarin improve proportion time patient spends target therapeutic INR range . Objectives A ) To determine ( RCT ) whether switch current warfarin user even morning dose alter proportion time spend therapeutic INR range . B ) To determine ( cross-sectional analysis baseline data ) whether even warfarin user great variability daily dinner-time vitamin K ingestion low time therapeutic INR range . C ) To determine ( prospective subgroup analysis RCT data ) whether effect warfarin timing TTR ( i.e . effect change morning dose ) influence day-to-day variability vitamin K consumption . Methods Design : Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-Point ( PROBE ) Study Population : Community family physician recruit across two Canadian province , British Columbia Alberta . These physician send letter ( ) warfarin use patient : ) Describes project ; b ) Lets patient know physician participating ; c ) Provides central contact number ( reach study co-ordinator ) information . The study co-ordinator dialog interested patient , ensures eligible , obtain write informed consent patient willing randomized obtains baseline information presume predictive TTR [ include age ≥ 80 year , hospitalization last 6 month , temporary plan discontinuation warfarin last 6 month ( e.g . elective surgery ) , number daily prescription medication , ≥ 6 month warfarin use , self-reported average number day per week high vitamin K contain food consume , variable dietary consumption ] . For consent patient meet interview criterion eligibility , family physician ask provide investigator patient 's target INR range last 6 month INR result test date . This provide baseline data cross-sectional analysis allow determination last RCT eligibility criterion ( availability complete adequate baseline INR data ) . Intervention : Morning warfarin ingestion versus continued even ingestion . Upon complete determination eligibility ( i.e . upon receive 6 month baseline INR data patient 's family physician ) consent eligible patient randomize stratification baseline % INR test range ( &lt; 50 % , 50-80 % , &gt; 80 % ) , use variable block 2 4 ( study co-ordinator clinical patient interaction ) , either morning ( active arm ) continue even ( control arm ) ingestion warfarin . REDCap software use perform randomization ensure allocation concealment . Patients ( hence provider ) blind intervention . Seven month enrolment patient investigator ask family physician provide u INR result period order determine outcomes specify . Sample size : We wish able demonstrate 20 % reduction time therapeutic range conservatively estimate ( since prior study explore outcome guide u ) standard deviation measure twice mean effect ( i.e . SD = 40 % ) . For t-test 1:1 allocation control experimental group , power = 0.9 , alpha = 0.05 , minimum difference = 20 % SD = 40 % required sample size per group 85 ( i.e . 170 subject total ) . Providing potential dropout increase target enrolment 200 subject . Statistical analysis : Calculating TTR : The therapeutic INR range patient vary determine treat physician . Typically therapeutic range 1 unit wide ( often 2 - 3 , 2.5 - 3.5 ) physician choose narrow wider range ( e.g . 3.0 - 3.5 , 2 - 3.5 ) . We standardize width target range determine midpoint patient 's individual target range use upper low limit 0.5 unit midpoint . For example , physician target narrow normal 3.0 3.5 range , use midpoint 3.25 assume ( standardized width ) target therapeutic range 2.75 3.75 . The proportion time therapeutic range determine use linear interpolation method Rosendaal ( conceptually ) draw line sequential INR value 8 week apart assigns project INR value every day interval . RCT : All analysis intention treat . The primary analysis percentage change time outside therapeutic range Student 's t-test data appear normally distribute Mann Whitney U test . The secondary analysis Student 's Mann Whitney U ( percentage change TTR maximum minimum INR value ) , Student 's Fisher 's exact test ( percentages patient TTR &gt; 75 % &amp; &lt; 60 % , major warfarin relate cardiovascular event ) . A subgroup analysis influence intervention number day per week high vitamin K food ingest carry look ANOVA analysis % change time outside therapeutic range accord 3 possible category number day per week consumption high vitamin K contain food ( less 2 , 2 5 , great 5 day per week ) . In analysis also examine effect intervention patient 's global assessment variable consumption high vitamin K contain food . To convert 4-point scale possible response dichotomous variable combine two option indicate variable diet , two option indicate least variable diet . Baseline cross-sectional analysis : The effect baseline TTR number day per week high vitamin K contain food consume analyzed multiple linear regression use baseline covariates include : gender , age ≥ 80 year , hospitalization last 6 month , temporary plan discontinuation warfarin last 6 month , number daily prescription medication , &lt; 6 month warfarin use , 3 possible category number day per week consume high vitamin K contain food , patient 's dichotomous global assessment variable pattern vitamin K consumption .</detailed_description>
