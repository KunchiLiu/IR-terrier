	<brief_title>Messages For Your Health : A Cancer Screening Prevention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Problem Outline , Theoretical Framework Project Justification The problem : Cervical Cancer Cervical cancer serious public health problem . Worldwide , third lead cause death woman . An estimated 270,000 woman die every year due cervical cancer , 85 % death take place develop country ( 1 ) . Chile´s national cervical cancer program create 1987 . Since , systematic implementation cervical cancer screen Papanicolau ( Pap ) smear , cervical cancer mortality rate drop significantly ( 2,3 ) . In spite effort , cervical cancer continue cause mortality 500 woman year Chile . Across nation , 59 percent population up-to-date Pap , figure change significantly last 10 year ( 2 ) . In Metropolitan Region , percentage low 56 percent . The distribution cervical cancer , like cancer , follow pattern inequality woman low socioeconomic status affect ( 4 ) . Closing Gap : Mobile Health ( mHealth ) Mobile technologies exponential increase last year . In 2014 , penetration mobile phone reach 90 % develop country compare 121 % developed country . ( 5 , 6 ) . This trend also see access mobile broadband technology , estimate penetration 32 % end 2014 . The number internet user worldwide follow trend well . By end 2014 , 3 billion user , 2/3 develop country . According survey Deputy Minister Telecommunications Chile ( 7 ) , access mobile fix internet connection 39.4 % end 2009 . This increase 60 % 2012 . This coverage distribute unequally accord socioeconomic class , 81 % penetration rich home less 30 % poor stratum ( 21.4 % 9.8 % respectively ) . On hand , mobile telephone reach 90 % home 2009 , rural urban survey respondent interview Deputy Minister Telecommunications . While inequality remain area well , much less profound technology : mobile telephone find widely distribute socioeconomic level , varies 97 % rich strata 82.8 % poor SES ( 7 ) . By end 2013 , percentage mobile telephone subscriber per 100 inhabitant almost 40 % mobile phone contract 94 % phone prepay plan . The Solution : Using mobile health technology ( mHealth ) Mobile health ( mHealth ) define WHO ( World Health Organization ) `` medical public health practice support mobile device , mobile phone , patient monitoring device , personal digital assistant ( PDAs ) , wireless device '' ( 9 ) . Given explosion use technology world particularly develop country , potential mobile health health issue huge . The overall interest mobile health widespread ( 11 ) . According WHO´s report mHealth 2011 ( 9 ) , mobile health strategy exist least 75 % country belong WHO region . 100 % country Southeast Asian region report mobile health initiative different stage development , Americas region report 90 % country form mobile health initiative ( Chile include statistic ) . According World Bank , high-income country report initiative low-income country . Some example mobile health initiative Latin America follow : Mexico report mobile health program call MedicalHome million mobile telephone subscriber access health professional support telephone $ 5 per month , charge directly cell phone account . Columbia report program treatment adherence reminder use voice message Peru report RCT ( Randomized Controlled Trial ) do assess treatment adherence use text messaging patient HIV/AIDS ( 9 ) . One relevant problem regard use technology isn´t sufficient evidence effectiveness prevention ( 12 ) . Because , imperative invest rigorous systematic evaluation intervention apply population level . While evidence exists show mobile health effective strategy treatment adherence prenatal care HIV TB ( 13,14,15 ) , potential use mobile health technology cancer prevention fully explore . Given widespread existence mobile telephone Chile , investigator intend study deliver simple , replicable , scalable intervention improve rate morbidity mortality due cervical cancer afflict Chile´s population . 2 . Research Questions 1 . Do mobile technology preventive benefit woman great risk get cervical cancer compare usual care ? 2 . In woman great risk get cervical cancer , barrier facilitator implement kind technological intervention ? 3 . Research Hypotheses 1 . Null Hypothesis : The propose intervention increase Pap adherence rate study health center . Alternative Hypothesis : The propose intervention increase Pap adherence rate study health center . 2 . Null Hypothesis : An intervention use mobile technology feasibly implement population . Alternative Hypothesis : It possible implement intervention use mobile technology population . 4 . Study Objectives General Objective : Evaluate implementation effectiveness mobile health intervention increase cervical cancer screen adherence . Specific Objectives : 1 . Evaluate effect text message intervention Pap adherence rate . 2 . Evaluate implementation usability cellphone mobile health intervention three health center Southeast Metropolitan Health District Santiago . 5 . Methodology Design : 1 . Quantitative phase : 1 . Target Population : Target population woman 25 64 year age use cell phone up-to-date Pap test ( Pap last three year ) . They must also register one follow health clinic : CESFAM ( Centro de Salud Familiar ) El Roble CESFAM Juan Pablo II . A randomize control trial carry evaluate effectiveness text message intervention improve Pap adherence . Socio-demographic variable associate effectiveness also analyze . Selection methodology : Using database medical record clinic , woman identify meet inclusion criterion . They invite participate study , choose accept , informed consent obtain . Before randomization , participant ask complete questionnaire simple demographic question question regard belief attitude cellphone use cervical cancer . 2 . Randomization : Participants randomize either intervention group control group use randomization software keep randomization sequence hidden . The control group receive usual care health center , consist different intervention depend health center attend . Examples usual care include periodic midwife visit , education health personnel cervical cancer health campaign . c ) Intervention : Women randomize intervention group receive text voice message ( design input previous qualitative phase ) send cellphone remind get Pap smear , send information cervical cancer , inform health clinic location hour could get Pap smear . 2 . Qualitative phase : The implementation mHealth intervention could fail many reason . Some previously describe barrier type mobile intervention : restriction number character text message , illiteracy , poor signal coverage quality , confidentiality pertinence family cellphone share . However , may many factor hinder facilitate effectiveness : lack fund keep credit cellphone throughout entire month , lose phone , little use text message elderly , among others . Investigators carry focus group woman receive care participate center order define barrier facilitator text message intervention promote Pap adherence . Focus Groups Participants : Women 25 64 year old meet inclusion criterion study . Midwives health care center . Investigators carry nine ( 9 ) focus group total . Women let u know barrier facilitator use technology midwife help investigator characterize usual care woman receive good inform text message content well barrier use . Every community member attend focus group receive incentive 5,000 Chilean peso ( 8 USD ) time information . Each health professional attends focus group receive 10,000 Chilean peso ( 16 USD ) . Data Encoding The focus group lead individual expert qualitative method assist Principal Investigator student assistant serve note-taker . The focus group record analysis . The audio focus group transcribe cod use software Atlas.ti version 6.2 Analysis Information analyze use qualitative content analysis process* two investigator extract relevant theme regard usage pattern , barrier , facilitator type intervention . Investigators use conceptual framework call PRECEDE-PROCEED order carry analysis* . Investigators use identify predisposing factor reinforce enable use mobile technology improve Pap adherence . The collected information contribute design intervention , quantitative phase study begin . ) Sample size Previous study show without intervention , around 30 % woman up-to-date Pap test get Pap within follow 6-12 month . Looking literature regard similar intervention pathology , investigator anticipate see absolute increase 15 % adherence rate . With difference proportion , alpha error 5 % beta error 20 % , estimate sample size 176 per arm . Considering loss 10 % , investigator recruit estimate 200 patient per arm . e ) Statistical Analysis Investigators use descriptive statistic characterize demographic variable include patient manner character indicator implementation . For primary outcome ( proportion woman up-to-date Pap ) , investigator use chi-squared test test difference proportion . For multivariate analysis , investigator use logistic regression Poisson regression . For categorical variable , investigator use chi-squared test .</detailed_description>
