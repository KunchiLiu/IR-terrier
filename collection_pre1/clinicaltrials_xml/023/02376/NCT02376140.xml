	<brief_summary>Sorghum primary source food 300 million people arid semi-arid region Africa . The grain one crop grow well arid climate , low content essential nutrient difficult digest . The African Bio-fortified Sorghum ( ABS ) Project , consortium nine institution lead Africa Harvest Biotech Foundation International , work develop new variety sorghum easy digest contain low level phytates improve bioavailability micronutrient . In order determine target level , ABS project need reliable information current level micronutrient deficiency consumption pattern sorghum nutrient interest , e.g . iron , zinc , vitamin A woman preschool child , currently available Burkina Faso . A background nutrition survey among child woman , comprise two round , one lean season ( July - August ) one harvest season ( November - January ) , conduct provide quantitative estimate sorghum , vitamin A , iron zinc intake woman young child two rural province Burkina Faso . The survey also biochemical component include blood collection analysis indicator deficiency vitamin A , iron zinc . Other important component study include anthropometric measurement , household child morbidity questionnaire , collection sorghum sample analysis phytate , vitamin A , iron zinc content .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives study The main objective study : - To determine iron , zinc , polyphenolic compound , phytate content raw sorghum grain cook sorghum base dish ; - To estimate prevalence level sorghum consumption woman preschool child ; - To determine percent contribution Sorghum total vitamin A , iron zinc intake ; - To assess prevalence inadequate intake vitamin A , iron zinc define cut-point method use Estimated Average Requirements woman child accord sex age ; - To determine prevalence micronutrient deficiencies use international ( WHO ) cut-offs serum retinol , serum ferritin serum zinc . Two secondary methodological objective add scientific interest potential practical implication : - To assess performance dietary diversity score reflect adequacy micronutrient intake ; - To assess performance questionnaire expenditures household level estimate food consumption household member . Setting The study conduct `` Boucle du Mouhoun '' `` Centre-Ouest '' region locate Western Burkina Faso . These region select base combination health , agriculture , live condition demographic criterion , include data sorghum production , household consumption prevalence malnutrition . The province Sourou `` Boucle du Mouhoun '' region province Sanguié `` Centre-Ouest '' region choose purposely base notably available information sorghum production consumption principal investigator general knowledge field . Study design It cross-sectional survey two round : first round lean period ( July-August 2010 ) characterize low food availability Burkina Faso ; second round period great food availability , immediately harvest ( November 2010-January 2011 ) . To enhance study power , individual survey two round . The study two main component : `` food consumption '' component `` lab analysis '' component . The food consumption component include : - A quantitative 24 hour recall dietary intake random sample preschool child age 3-5 mother - A qualitative dietary diversity questionnaire child mother , administer day 24-h recall different enumerator - A repetition 24 hour recall non consecutive day use randomly select subsample approximately one third original sample - A questionnaire income expenditure subsample approximately one third household ( i.e . household repetition 24-h recall ) - Anthropometric data ( weight , height MUAC ) collect child mother - A socio demographic questionnaire morbidity recall child mother The laboratory component include : - Collection blood sample randomly select subsample mother child ( one third original sample ) vitamin A , iron zinc biochemical indicator well haemoglobin acute phase protein ( C-reactive protein alpha-1-glycoprotein marker inflammation ) ; blood sample take place second round survey ( November 2010 - January 2011 ) . - Collection raw sorghum cook sorghum dish sample determination iron , zinc , polyphenolic compound phytate content ; food sample collection take place two round . Target population Women preschool child select micronutrient requirement high due need reproduction growth , respectively . The age range target preschool child 36-59 month several reason : Firstly , want sure exclude breastfed child since measure breast milk intake complicate implement field ; Secondly , start age 36 month , child use eat common family dish make recall easier , keep number individual recipe low . Thirdly , venous puncture less problematic child age 36 month . Sample size dietary intake : use food consumption data survey conduct among woman reproductive age Ouagadougou , one determine reasonable hypothesis coefficient variation sorghum intakes 0.60 , precision 0.10 , type I error 0.05 suppose design effect 1.5 , require sample size 207 subject . Finally decide set sample size 240 household per province per round , account lose follow-up . The repetition 24 hour recall perfomed 3 8 subject . Sample size biochemical indicator : Given type I error 0.05 , calculate hypothetical sample size different value prevalence micronutrient deficiency ( 30 , 40 50 % ) different desire precision ( either 0.05 , 0.075 , 0.10 , 0.125 0.15 ) also take account different hypothesis survey design effect . A huge sample size would require get precision less 0.10 , depend design effect , data representative individual level ( woman child ) province . According constraint logistics financing , decide limit sample size 90 woman 90 child province . Sample size sorghum analysis : Five sample type sorghum ( red , white , hybrid ) 5 sample type sorghum-based food ( paste , gruel ) analyse province round . This add 30 sample class sorghum sorghum-based food province round , total 120 food sample . However , give potentially high variability nutrient density food sample , analysis perform pool 6 sample type , come close village belong common health area . Location sample procedure In province , multistage sampling procedure use : - Firstly list health centre province make population size correspond health area obtain heath district and/or administrative data . Five centre randomly select province , probability proportional size ( population health area ) . - The proportional size sampling technique use select 6 village health area , lead total 30 village . - Finally , 8 household select village , list eligible household obtain census perform enumerator day ahead data collection . - Among 8 HH include random selection make determine take part repetition 24-h recall ( 3 HH ) blood sampling ( 3 HH ) . Data Collection Anthropometric data collect study participant ( mother child ) use standard WHO procedures Food intake assessed 24-H recall use multiple pas method . A set standard recipe prepare ( observation ) individual recipe investigate directly . A local Food Composition table build compliling information available food composition table ( Mali , FAO , USDA ) . The food sample do household select purpose village . In household , 1 kg sorghum ( white red ) sample clean new polyethylene plastic bag avoid contamination . For meal sample , select household ask prepare sorghum base dish ( tô porridge ) accord habit . All sample put icebox transportation IRSS laboratory extraction analyse do . The blood collection conduct health centre cool place subdue light conduct trained health professional . Care take avoid contact sample surround dust , sweat , possible exogenous source contamination . The sampling technique venous puncture 10 mL blood .</detailed_description>
