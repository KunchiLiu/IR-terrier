	<brief_title>Diagnostic Value Urinary Indices Differentiating Pre-renal Renal Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Critically ill patient acute kidney injury ( AKI ) include . Urinary index obtain immediately define AKI , include specific gravity ( SG ) , urine osmolarity ( Uosm ) , urine sodium ( UNa ) , fractional excretion sodium ( FENa ) , fractional excretion urea ( FEurea ) . The patterns renal function hemodynamic status serve clinical definition pre-renal renal AKI . Hemodynamic status evaluate inclusion follow patient ' ICU stay . Those hemodynamically stable inclusion classify renal AKI . Those hemodynamically unstable inclusion follow hemodynamic stabilization . Those AKI recovery hemodynamic stabilization classify pre-renal AKI . Those without AKI recovery define renal AKI . Urinary index measure hemodynamic stability . One investigator objectives evaluate diagnostic value urinary index use recovery renal function hemodynamic stabilization definition pre-renal AKI . Transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) prove reliable method measuring leave renal blood flow surgical operation . Decreased renal blood flow measure TEE may serve objective definition pre-renal AKI . The mesurement conduct inclusion patient sedate , intubate , without TEE contraindication . If patient hemodynamically unstable inclusion , measurement repeat hemodynamic stabilization . The investigator study also serve follow aim : ( 1 ) feasibility measure renal blood flow TEE among critically ill patient ; ( 2 ) correspondence renal blood flow measure TEE clinical definition pre-renal renal AKI ; ( 3 ) diagnostic value urinary index differentiate pre-renal renal AKI , judge renal blood flow measure TEE .</detailed_description>
