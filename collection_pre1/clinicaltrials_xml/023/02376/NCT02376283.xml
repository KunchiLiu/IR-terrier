	<brief_summary>Major heart attack cause numerous factor , include sudden clot formation coronary artery lead blockage heart muscle death . The clot largely make sticky clot blood cell ( platelet ) . A patient major heart attack treat emergency primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) wire balloon use reopen coronary artery stent ( slot metal tube ) place keep artery open . Aspirin , one two antiplatelet drug ( prasugrel ticagrelor ) give prior PPCI prevent clot formation . Both antiplatelet drug take tablet form healthy stable patient drug take least 30 min 2 hour exert adequate effect . Often PPCI procedure perform well within timescale . It possible major heart attack limit body ability absorb drug also . In study , patient major minor heart attack give either prasugrel ticagrelor per license indication guideline recommendation . A 15 ml blood sample take first balloon inflation reopen block artery , 20 minute , 60 minute , 4 hour take drug . Each blood sample subject variety test determine antiplatelet drug activity . This study identify two agent use work effectively PPCI , give short timescales involve . It also show patient major heart attack absorb drug less well patient less severe heart attack . In future might intravenous agent valuable set PPCI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study design , nonrandomized nature . A total 90 subject include study distribute equally 6 patient group carefully select patient receive antiplatelet drug per current accepted NICE guideline license indication . In current ethically approve protocol ver 1.4 ( 5/11/12 ) Groups 1,3 4 already recruit full data set collectedÍ¾ Group 1 STEMI prasugrel Group 3 STEMI clopidogrel Group 4 NSTEMI clopidogrel The current protocol allow specific group NSTEMI patient ( diabetic &lt; 75 year age , &gt; 60 kg ) treat prasugrel recruit . The restrictive nature criterion would allow u make direct comparison STEMI patient treat prasugrel . In light eligibility criterion widen NSTEMI patient treat prasugrel . The propose NSTEMI criterion follow : 1 . Group 2 : Patients NSTEMI 75 year age great 60kg weight receive prasugrel loading ( 60mg ) ( line manufacturer recommendation license ) 4 hour sample collection period patient treat percutaneous coronary intervention receive prasugrel maintenance dose 10mg daily ( line NICE recommendation local guideline ) , patient proceed treat percutaneous coronary intervention switch clopidogrel 75mg daily ( line NICE recommendation local guideline ) follow day . The investigator also propose include recruitment follow two group ticagrelor prescribe accordance NICE guidance licence indication : 2 . Group 5 : Patients admit STEMI receive ticagrelor loading ( 180 mg ) maintenance ( 90mg bd per day ) ( line manufacturer 's recommendation license ) . 3 . Group 6 : Patients Admitted NSTEMI receive ticagrelor loading ( 180 mg ) maintenance ( 90mg bd per day ) ( line manufacturer 's recommendation license ) The investigator begin recruitment group 5 6 patient recruitment complete group 2 PROCEDURE LOG : STEMI patient identify follow admission PPCI . Patient consent group shall 2 stage process . Initially , shorten patient information sheet shall read patient admission prior PPCI delay treatment . Once verbal consent obtain P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor administer patient per current local national guidance . The time load dose carefully record patient transfer cardiac catheterization suite PPCI . After insertion radial femoral sheath , 15 ml ( approx 3 teaspoonfuls volume ) whole blood drawn sheath 20 minute post dose ( close time point practicable ) also first balloon inflation time . A 15 ml take 60 minute post dose ( close practicable ) . The second stage consent occur PPCI patient transfer ward pain free able rest . At stage full patient information sheet shall give patient read write consent sought . A final 15ml blood sample take 4 hour post dosing , patient 's participation study come end . NSTEMI/UA Potential patient approached member research team , offer patient full write patient information sheet obtain write consent . Following consent patient administer P2Y12 inhibitor ( prasugrel ticagrelor ) . The time load dose carefully record . 15 ml ( approx 3 teaspoonfuls volume ) blood take 20 minute , 60 minute 4 hour post dosing , patient 's participation study come end . For STEMI NSTEMI/UA group , aspirin already give ambulance assess 20 minute P2Y12 inhibitor load 60 minute . Each blood sample take undergo series test encompass presence function antiplatelet medication patient suffer either major minor heart attack .</detailed_description>

Allergic aspirin P2Y12 antagonists trial 3 . Have preexist cardiogenic shock 4 . Have concurrent septic inflammatory disease e.g . rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , pneumonia . 5 . Already take P2Y12 inhibitor 6 . Known bleed diathesis 7 . Patients 75 year age 60 kg previous stroke/transient ischaemic attack , eligible prasugrel rather ticagrelor . 8 . Patients history intracranial haemorrhage receive prasugrel ticagrelor rather receive treatment clopidogrel .</criteria>
