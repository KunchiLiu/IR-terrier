	<brief_title>Comparison Study Pancreatic Fiducial Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective multicenter study compare cost , time , complication , migration rate two commercially available FDA approve needle ; 19 gauge endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) BNX needle 22 gauge EUS FNA BNX needle . There fiducials place pancreas accord facility policy procedure . This randomized prospective multicenter trial . A minimum 14 patient maximum 30 patient enrol ten participate site . Enrollment project complete within approximately one year . Adult subject diagnosis pancreatic cancer receive SBRT pancreatic cancer via Cyberknife Tomotherapy undergo EUS guide fiducial marker placement . Subjects randomize receive fiducial marker placement either 19 gauge EUS , FNA BNX needle 22 gauge EUS , FNA BNX needle . For patient , standard hospital protocol follow EUS procedure patient care management . The study duration commence time EUS guide fiducial marker placement conclude time last SBRT pancreas . Cost effectiveness evaluate provide itemized statement , include anesthesiologist , endoscopist charge . Time procedure evaluate time point first lead needle load time last marker place . Time measurement begin Endoscopist insert echoendoscope patient . Thus patient anesthesia , position , staff ready case . The time end last fiducial marker place . Complications report may include limited pain , bleeding , peritonitis , pancreatitis . Migration report timeframe simulation last day SBRT . The ability receive SBRT EUS guide fiducial placement report simply yes . Sites provide de-identified itemized statement EUS guide fiducial placement procedure , prior discount rate , include endoscopist anesthesiologist . Follow evaluation treatment pancreatic cancer perform accordance standard care procedure procedure deem necessary attending physician .</detailed_description>
