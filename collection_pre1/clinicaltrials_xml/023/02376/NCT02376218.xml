	<brief_summary>It common practice leave chest drainage catheter lung surgical resection manage air leak . The air leakage usually stop initial postoperative day , patient , last long period time , prevent removal chest tube lead patient discomfort , increase likelihood develop postoperative complication longer length hospital stay . Pleurodesis effective method address postoperative air leak consist inject irritate solution chest cavity . This perform regularly lung resection different reason include associate pain , cost , fear infection . Pleurodesis hyperosmolar glucose solution use year good result Asian country simplicity low cost . Its effectiveness pleurodesis report case spontaneous pneumothorax chylothorax , efficiency stop air leak postoperative period remain defined .</brief_summary>
