	<brief_summary>The population age worldwide , require attention health need lead dramatic increase health care cost . Prevention delay onset disorder associate age need . Dietary intake pectin , dietary fiber , may beneficial effect gut health parameter , i.e . intestinal barrier function , immune function microbial composition . As intestinal barrier function may compromise elderly investigate whether effect pectin select parameter gut health differ young vs. old individual . The primary objective study investigate effect age pectin-induced change intestinal permeability . Furthermore , study seven secondary objective . This study conform randomize , double-blind placebo-controlled design include two parallel arms.The study population consist Healthy human volunteer ( male female ) , 18-40 65-75 year old , BMI 20-30 kg/m2 . One group receive 7.5 gram pectin supplement twice daily four week . A second group receive 7.5 gram placebo supplement twice daily four week . Before supplementation period , several measurement take place . The main study parameter change urinary sugar excretion ratio intervention period .</brief_summary>
