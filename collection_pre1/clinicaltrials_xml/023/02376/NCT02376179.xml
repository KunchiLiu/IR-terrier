	<brief_summary>We devise simple method continuously measure endotracheal tube cuff pressure ( CP ) use invasive pressure monitor setup ( IPMS ) , use routinely operate room monitor arterial central venous pressure . We previously confirm vitro vivo ( previous IRB approve protocol ) , clinically applicable agreement IPMS reading value obtain standard manometer ( gold standard ) . In current study , prospectively evaluate relationship patient 's head position CP patient undergo otolaryngological surgery also measure oxygen nitrous oxide saturation oropharynx .</brief_summary>
