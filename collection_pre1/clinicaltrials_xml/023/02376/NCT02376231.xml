	<brief_summary>Surgery ovarian cancer involve big cut tummy ( abdomen ) follow removal pelvic organ ( womb , tubes ovary ) , abdominal organ ( fat tissue { omentum } , appendix ) tissue involve cancer . Several study worldwide report woman survive long enjoy longer disease free interval disease return visible disease remove time surgery . Achieving easy often widespread disease surgeon unable remove every tumour nodule present attach surface bowel , diaphragm important Extensive surgery prolong operating associate high risk . Plasma energy commonly refer 4th state matter solid , liquid gas . When gas heat , partially wholly ionize result high energy particle like ion , electron atom refer 'plasma ' . PlasmaJetÂ® ( PJ ) new device use fine jet neutral argon plasma handpiece show ability vaporise nodule close sensitive organ like bowel . It may offer potential treat tumour nodule close sensitive area like bowel . There study explore role vaporise tumour nodule impact survival . The PJ may use surgeon seal bleed tissue ( coagulate ) burn away thin layer tissue ( ablate ) vaporization . It license use achieve effect coagulation ablation . It similar conventional surgical device routinely use ( call diathermy ) achieve effect . The PJ however slightly different may also use tissue vaporise tumour nodule woman ovarian cancer surgery though full extent role remain unclear .</brief_summary>
