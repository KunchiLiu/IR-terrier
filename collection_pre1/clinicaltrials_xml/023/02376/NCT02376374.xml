	<brief_summary>The investigator propose study inter- intra-household Oral Polio Vaccine ( OPV ) transmission primarily inactivated-polio vaccine ( IPV ) -vaccinated community Mexico . The investigator enroll 3 distinct cluster households municipality Orizaba , Veracruz , Mexico prior February 2015 National Immunization Week ( NIW . ) These cluster physically separate one another differ proportion OPV-eligible child receive OPV February 2015 NIW ( 10 % , 30 % 70 % vaccinate . ) The investigator look inter-household intra-household transmission . The investigator determine epidemiologic ( i.e . : degree contact ) , anthropometric ( i.e . : nutritional status ) clinical covariates ( i.e . : IPV/OPV immunization history ) associate intra-household transmission .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose prospective study conduct 3 distinct cluster 150 household one semi-urban municipality Orizaba , Veracruz , Mexico February 2015 National Immunization Week ( NIW . ) Mexico provide unique environment study OPV transmission . The last case poliomyelitis report 1990 . Mexico transition OPV IPV-based immunization regimen 2007-2008 . Currently , Mexican child receive IPV 2 , 4 , 6 , 18 month age . In addition , child â‰¤5 year old receive least 2 dos IPV eligible receive OPV biannual NIW hold February May year . Because change vaccination regimens time , Mexican household consist individual different degree susceptibility OPV infection : born 2007 expose WPV OPV OPV alone , born 2007 expose IPV intermittent OPV exposure , un-vaccinated infant , maternal polio virus antibody . By study OPV transmission setting , able assess impact differ immunization status OPV shed transmission . We conduct study relatively isolated semi-urban municipality Orizaba , Veracruz , Mexico . These household cluster differ proportion OPV-eligible child OPV-vaccinated February 2015 National Immunization Week ( 10 % , 30 % 70 % . ) We enroll household least 1 healthy child le 5 year age up-to-date IPV vaccination history . Enrolled household randomize OPV-vaccinated non-vaccinated arm household cluster . Eligible child households OPV-vaccinated arm randomize either receive OPV remain un-vaccinated . Thus , one child per household OPV-vaccinated arm vaccinate . We collect stool sample member enrol household serially course study determine individual shed OPV stool use serotype-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay . We define inter-household transmission fecal OPV shed member non-vaccinated household . By compare inter-household transmission rate among household cluster , determine proportion OPV-vaccinated child impact community OPV transmission primarily IPV-vaccinated community . These result critical predict risk OPV re-introduction event poliomyelitis outbreak post-OPV era . We define intra-household transmission OPV shed household contact live vaccinated household . We examine intra-household transmission cluster together determine certain characteristic associate transmission household contact . Elucidating characteristic would allow targeted intervention reduce prevent OPV transmission cessation policy implement event OPV re-introduction need polio endgame .</detailed_description>
