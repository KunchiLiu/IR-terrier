	<brief_title>The Health Impact High Intensity Exercise Training With Intervals During Cardiac Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac rehabilitation eight week program design help patient regain good health change lifestyle possible heart attack , heart surgery heart problem . Patients take part exercise session education lesson , tailor meet personal need . The exercise training component cardiac rehabilitation may deliver interval short intense session ( also know high intensity interval ) current standard care longer less intense session ( moderate intense interval ) . Both exercise show increase fitness level also prevent future risk heart disease . Although evidence suggest high intensity interval training produce good body muscle recovery fitness cardiac rehabilitation , many important health outcome yet determine . Such outcome include ability body safely control blood pressure heartbeat rate . Others include health-related quality life emotional well-being . This study explore whether difference health outcome introduction intervention patient undergoing high intensity interval exercise compare moderate intensity interval exercise term recovery ability control blood pressure heartbeat rate , also health-related quality life emotional well-being . In addition , patient ' opinion seek regard pain level , acceptability extent enjoyment get two type exercise training . For patient , exercise program design match preference requirement . Some may prefer work gym environment program design around type activity . Others may prefer work group exercise circuit , program match available . When compare two type exercise , everything keep ; warm cool , type movement ; thing change intensity exercise . Before eight week training program , patient ask assessment measure effect exercise body . Things like heart rate blood pressure take also undergo physical fitness test . After training , patient complete questionnaire establish level enjoyment program , motivate complete . In addition , quality life emotional well-being measure complete questionnaire 8 week cardiac rehabilitation program . The investigator anticipate total 46 patient recruit study period 6 month . In United Kingdom , believe deliver improve exercise training program potential enhance patient ' recovery heart disease may reduce need hospital service therefore well use National Health Service resource .</detailed_description>
