	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize implement electronic health record-based early warning system severe infection ( severe sepsis ) decrease time antibiotic order . The study consist algorithm monitor lab value , vital sign , nurse documentation sign severe sepsis . When criterion meet , alert deliver via electronic health record nurse doctor simultaneously alert via pager another nurse . The investigator plan randomize patient generate alert analyze data collect information approximately 6 month sufficient detect 10 % difference two patient group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Electronic Health Record-embedded Severe Sepsis Early Warning Alert</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis lead cause mortality Stanford Hospital rank 54th 119 hospital accord UHC data approximately 60 episode documented sepsis per quarter . Based preliminary data , concern sepsis recognize late treat timely enough fashion . In fact , evidence expert guideline suggestion-delaying antibiotic patient septic shock increase mortality 6.7 % per hour ( 1C recommendation severe sepsis Surviving Sepsis Campaign author ) . As part hospital wide initiative improve treatment sepsis ultimately reduce sepsis-related mortality , EHR-based clinical decision support ( aka BPA ) implement . This BPA algorithm alert practitioner trigger clinical workflow criterion meet . Criteria include lab value , vital sign nurse flow sheet description perfusion ( Table 1 ) . The algorithm alert , 24 hour period , three criterion manifestation group , one criterion suspect infection group one criterion organ dysfunction group . Note one variable ( eg creatinine &gt; 2 ) fulfill criteria one group . Figure 1 contains detail propose EHR workflow . After criterion meet , whomever next chart RN MD user-type , receive interruptive alert via EHR ; simultaneously page automatically send EHR crisis nurse ass patient notify primary MD RN . Electronic early warning system predictive analytic tool lack rigorous evaluation standardization . There literature demonstrating unintended consequence even harm implementation electronic health record clinical decision support tool . As , situation clinical equipoise unclear whether quality improvement initiative benefit patient care . To evaluate question , severe sepsis BPA initiate randomized fashion patient randomly assign either potentially generate alert describe generate alert silently quality improvement staff aware criterion meet via EHR . This randomized , single-blind prospective quality improvement study . Patients randomized encounter BPA visible invisible hospital admission . If visible , alert display primary nurse physician send page crisis nurse BPA criterion meet . If invisible , alert trigger invisible care team ( visible quality improvement staff via EHR ) - Inclusion criterion Admitted Stanford Hospital ( inpatient observation status ) medical surgical service least 24 hour period study - Exclusion criterion Admitted intensive-care level service ( MICU , SICU , CVICU , CCU ) - While ideally make available ICU patient , alert likely far less specific ICU patient less clinically useful give high level care ( eg 1:1 nursing hourly vital sign ) . Patient code status DNR/C ( comfort care ) - These patient would appropriate treat antibiotic aggressive care generally give comfort care goal care . Emergency Department patient ( may include near future ) - Primary endpoint Percentage patient receive antibiotic within three hour - Secondary endpoint - Percentage patient hypotension lactate &gt; = 4 receive least 30 ml/kg fluid - Rate 3 hour sepsis bundle completion ( serum lactate , blood culture , antibiotic ) - Length hospital stay - Cost hospital stay per day overall cost - Mortality hospital discharge - Sample size duration - Based prior study , predict 10-15 % difference one primary endpoint ( see Sawyer et . Al , Crit Care Med . 2011 March , 39:469 ) - We therefore anticipate enrolling 1500 patient , estimate 150 true sepsis , approximately six month , achieve 80 % power . - Analysis compare endpoint among patient treatment control group - Early stopping decide oversight committee review data 3 month . If statistically significant different 10 % group , study terminate early discussion hospital quality safety committee , use whichever strategy superior patient hospital .</detailed_description>
