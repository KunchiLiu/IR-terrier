	<brief_summary>Methanol poisoning could result severe optic neuropathy , profound visual loss finally optic atrophy permanent , irreversible optic atrophy visual loss . Erythropoietin ( EPO ) recently emerge drug may help retinal ganglion cell loss improve optic nerve function acquire type optic neuropathy include traumatic optic neuropathy , ischemic optic neuropathy optic neuritis .It find EPO offer protection optic nerve retina injured apoptosis process start retinal ganglion cell . The standard treatment methanol poison reanimation , metabolic stabilization , inhibition alcohol dehydrogenase antagonist agent elimination toxic metabolite early phase toxicity dialysis . However , establish optic neuropathy visual loss little chance , , visual recovery definitive treatment exist treatment case . The investigator recently report investigator preliminary result 16 case methanol poison find beneficial effect systemic erythropoietin methanol associate optic neuropathy . Now , investigator aim investigate effect agent clinical trial . The purpose study determine EPO could improve optic nerve function help patient improve visual recovery methanol poisoning . Primary outcome measure would best-corrected visual function secondary outcome measure ocular coherence tomography ( OCT ) measure mean peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickness . Results study could valuable formulate evidence-based management Methanol Associated Optic Neuropathy ( MAON ) provide high level evidence change practice management methanol poisoning . Also could provide valuable data neuroprotective effect erythropoietin specifically neuroscience ophthalmology . The EPO-MAON trial design randomize , control , observer , interpreter blind mono-center pilot trial two parallel group primary endpoint best correct visual acuity 120 day enrollment treatment group . All patient methanol poison refer Farabi hospital examine evaluated best-corrected visual acuity , pupillary light reflex , relative afferent pupillary defect , color vision ( Ishihara plat ) , fundus photography , slit lamp exam anterior segment fundus exam 78 D lens .</brief_summary>
