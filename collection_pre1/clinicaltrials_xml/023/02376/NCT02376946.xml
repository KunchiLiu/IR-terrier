	<detailed_description>This study prospective , randomize , double-blinded , control , clinical trial evaluate efficacy use PEMF postoperative period decrease swell pain extraction partial full/complete boney impact third molar . The study group comprise subject receive PEMF ActiPatchTM treatment postoperative management pain edema . The control group comprise subject receive placebo patch treatment postoperative management pain edema . Thirty ( 30 ) subject randomly assign group . Enrollment continue sixty ( 60 ) qualify subject recruit . Eligibility criterion base standard conduct oral surgery procedure third molar extraction , addition safety consideration contraindication ActiPatch ( TM ) agent use . Moreover , select subject surgical difficulty surgical trauma anticipate standardize classification system impacted third molar . This classification system utilized TUSDM ( Tufts University School Dental Medicine ) oral surgery clinic . All inclusion exclusion criterion thoroughly explain relevant section proposal . Postoperative edema pain evaluate use 3dMD ( TM ) Visual Analog Scale , respectively . Different measurement obtain immediately surgery standard periodic interval describe Materials Methods section proposal . Any difference postoperative edema , pain , site responsible request rescue pain medication compare analyzed two group . Up 200 subject enrol study account screen failure . Up forty ( 40 ) subject randomly assign group . Recruitment continue eighty ( 80 ) subject qualify study participation . This allow 25 % dropout end 60 subject complete study . The primary outcome , postoperative facial swell 72 hour ( measure 3dMD ( TM ) ) , compare two group use independent sample t-test data normally distribute , Mann Whitney U test non-parametric method need utilized . This approach also utilized compare pain ( measure VAS ) . The percentage subject use rescue pain medication due experience postoperative pain group treat PEMF ActiPatch ( TM ) compare percentage subject use rescue pain medication due experience postoperative pain group receive placebo , use Chi-square test . In addition , volume measurement VAS score analyze use repeat measure analysis , adjust subject age , gender pain perception . Furthermore , correlation placebo group use rescue pain medication determine association dictate calculate odds ratio . The statistical significance association examine use Chi-square test . All p-values le 0.025 consider statistically significant . Statistical analysis perform use SAS , Version 9.2 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . An initial 3dMD ( TM ) scan obtain baseline evaluation extraction visit . A second 3dMD ( TM ) scan obtain evaluation determination facial swell 72 hour follow visit . A third scan obtain 10 day follow visit evaluate degree resolution swell . The scan result computer-generated image , investigator outline area clinical interest calculate volume use integration . The process surface scan volume measurement use 3dMD ( TM ) Vultus softwareÂ® ( 3dMD ( TM ) , Atlanta , Georgia , United States ) .The Vultus software allow pre post-surgery superimposition image well quantitative evaluation surface volume change . The PI site training Georgia 3dMD facility additional training camera array instal . The technique obtain image straight forward set instruction installation site immediate review necessary . The PI representative 3dMD company give training co-investigators use device . The degree facial swell two group two time point ( 72 hour follow 10 day follow ) compare use data collect 3dMD ( TM ) . Furthermore , change volume two scan take 72 hour follow visit 10 day follow within group also compare . The volumetric difference two group analyze statistical significance .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Subjects either sex race age 18 30 year . 30 Years old upper age limit wisdom teeth extraction normally do age 18 30 , since age 30 additional complication arise surgery . 2 . Subjects decision make extract 2 4 third molar . At least two must classify full partially bony impact ( define ) angulation local anesthesia alone , local anesthesia sedation local anesthesia general anesthesia outpatient set . 1 . Full/complete bony : The entire tooth level alveolar bone . The tooth completely encase bone gingiva cut reflect back , tooth see . Bone removal ( large amount ) together root section need remove tooth.33 2 . Partial bony : A portion height contour tooth level alveolar bone . The superficial portion tooth cover soft tissue height tooth 's contour level surround alveolar bone.33 3 . Subjects must physically able tolerate conventional surgical procedure ( ASA I/II ) 4 . Subjects must agree follow study protocol . 1 . Subjects know pregnant think may pregnant . ( A urine pregnancy test perform female subject Day 0 Visit 1 .
