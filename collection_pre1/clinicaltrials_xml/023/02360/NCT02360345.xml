	<brief_summary>This open label , single-centre dose escalation phase 1 clinical trial ONX-0801 . The study evaluate two schedule ONX-0801 concurrently : weekly alternate week dosing , repeat 28-day treatment cycle . The study consist two stage : dose escalation phase , recommend phase II dose determine ; expansion phase , 30 patient treat recommended phase II dose schedule support design subsequent trial ONX-0801 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial ONX-0801 Once Weekly Alternate Weekly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During dose escalation phase , patient enrol alternately either : - q1wk schedule ONX-0801 administer 1-hour IV infusion Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 repeat 28-day treatment cycle ; start dose 1 mg/m2 first cohort ; OR - q2wk schedule ONX-0801 administer 1-hour IV infusion Days 1 15 repeat 28-day treatment cycle ; start dose 2 mg/m2 first cohort ; Cohorts 3 patient receive ONX-0801 escalating dos schedule Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) occur Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) determine schedule . Once recommended Phase II dose ( RP2D ) schedule establish , additional patient may recruit dose expansion phase maximum total 30 patient characterize safety , tolerability pharmacodynamics . This subgroup patient limit expected high rate expression α-FR , patient ovarian endometrial , cancer . Approximately 66 patient solid tumour enter study . Dose escalation : Approximately 18 patient schedule dose escalation phase . The final number dose escalation phase depend number dose escalation require reach DLT . Dose expansion : Up 30 patient enrol dose expansion phase , cohort enrich patient tumour type expect high rate expression α-folate receptor , include ovarian endometrial cancer . A minimum 20 patient platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer enrol .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients histologically cytologically proven solid tumour ( include NonHodgkin 's Hodgkin 's lymphoma ) . Patients must disease failed standard therapy standard curative therapy exists . At dose expansion phase , entry limit patient ovarian endometrial cancer availability archival paraffin embed tissue Measurable ( define RECIST version 1.1 ) evaluable ( base tumour marker ) disease Life expectancy least 12 week World Health Organisation ( WHO ) performance status 01 ( Appendix 1 ) Haematological biochemical index within range show . These measurement must perform within one week ( Day 7 Day 1 ) patient go trial . Laboratory Test Value require Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥ 9.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x ( ULN ) unless raise due tumour case 5 x ULN permissible Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN PT APTT ≤ 1.25x ULN Normal ( clinically significant abnormality ) 12lead ECG , QTc interval &lt; 470 m Pulmonary function test FVC &gt; 70 % , DLCOc ( DLCO correct Hb ) &gt; 60 % 18 year Written ( sign date ) inform consent capable cooperate treatment followup Radiotherapy ( except palliative reason ) , endocrine therapy , immunotherapy chemotherapy previous four week ( six week nitrosoureas , MitomycinC ) 4 week investigational medicinal product ) treatment . Ongoing toxic manifestation previous treatment . Exceptions alopecia certain Grade 1 toxicity , opinion Investigator DDU exclude patient Patients new brain metastasis . Patients treat ( surgically excise irradiate ) stable brain metastasis eligible long treatment least 4 week prior initiation study drug brain MRI within 2 week initiation study drug negative new metastasis . Patients pulmonary metastasis History thoracic radiation history likely create preexist lung disease Ability become pregnant ( already pregnant lactate ) . However , female patient negative serum urine pregnancy test enrolment agree use two highly effective form contraception ( oral , injected implant hormonal contraception condom , intrauterine device condom , diaphragm spermicidal gel condom ) four week enter trial , trial six month afterwards consider eligible.. Male patient partner childbearing potential ( unless agree take measure father child use one form highly effective contraception [ condom plus spermicide ] trial six month afterwards ) . Men pregnant lactate partner advise use barrier method contraception ( example , condom plus spermicidal gel ) prevent exposure foetus neonate . Major thoracic abdominal surgery patient yet recover . Patients subacute bowel obstruction Patients use heparin , warfarin/coumadin type anticoagulant , however , lowdose ( &lt; 2mg ) coumadin portacath patency allow ; Organ transplant recipient Patients know systemic disease pulmonary involvement , include active uncontrolled infection . Known serologically positive hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Patients history QT prolongation , clinically significant VT , VF , heart block , MI within 1 year , CHF NYHA Class III IV , unstable angina , angina within 6 month , evidence clinically significant coronary artery disease Is participant plan participate another interventional clinical trial , whilst take part Phase I study ONX0801 . Participation observational trial would acceptable . Any condition Investigator 's opinion would make patient good candidate clinical trial .</criteria>
