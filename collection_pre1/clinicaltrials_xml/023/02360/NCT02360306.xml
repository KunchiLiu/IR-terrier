	<brief_summary>Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration ( EBUS-TBNA ) widely use diagnosis mediastinal hilar adenopathy well stag lung cancer patient . Many study confirm utility EBUS-TBNA high sensitivity , specificity , accuracy diagnosis mediastinal hilar adenopathy . 1-3 Less well report use EBUS bronchoscope perform procedures transbronchial biopsy ( TBBx ) , endobronchial biopsy ( EBBx ) , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) airway brushing . While well report medical literature , anecdotal evidence support practice . The investigator propose methodological evaluation full spectrum procedure perform possible use EBUS bronchoscope .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Analysis EBUS Scope Hybrid Bronchoscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Objectives ( include primary secondary objective ) Primary objective - To study fully describe full spectrum procedure perform use EBUS bronchoscope outside EBUS-TBNA . 2 . Background ( briefly describe pre-clinical clinical data , current experience procedure , drug device , relevant information justify research ) There currently exist anecdotal evidence individual report use EBUS bronchoscopes performance non-EBUS-TBNA procedure . Given full size work channel standard bronchoscopic tool able pas , EBUS bronchoscope report used performance procedure BAL , TBBx , EBBx airway brush . Frequently bronchoscopic procedure EBUS-TBNA use sample lymph node within hilum mediastinum exists need perform procedure include limited list . In case , EBUS bronchoscope remove exchanged standard video bronchoscope often time dirty scope single procedure . We routinely use EBUS bronchoscopy daily practice interventional pulmonologists would like study use bronchoscopes performance procedure TBNA perhaps effort fully understand benefit limitation associate use EBUS bronchoscope conventional video bronchoscopy . 3 . Study Procedures 1 . Study design We plan collect data clinically indicate procedure use EBUS bronchoscope twelve month time frame JHH outpatient endoscopy suite . No procedure perform research purpose . No additional procedure perform outside scope standard practice . 2 . Study duration number study visit require research participant . 12 month study duration , research visit require . 3 . Justification participant receive routine care current therapy stop . All patient receive routine standard care . 4 . Justification inclusion placebo non-treatment group . The study aim analyze data generate clinically indicated procedure thus placebo non-treatment group include study . 4 . Drugs/ Substances/ Devices . The rationale choose drug dose choose device use . The rationale study EBUS bronchoscope application non-TBNA procedure study actual use scope well ascertain whether EBUS scope able perform bronchoscopic procedure thus decrease need extra bronchoscope decrease cleaning cost wear device . 5 . Benefits . Description probable benefit participant society . There direct benefit participant society may benefit medical society EBUS bronchoscopes show able perform full range bronchoscopic procedure may decrease cost medical system well potential reduction procedure time eliminate need exchange scope mid procedure .</detailed_description>
