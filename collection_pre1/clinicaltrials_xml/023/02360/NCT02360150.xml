	<brief_summary>The purpose study therefore show associate cardiac angiography echocardiography , myocardial see late , would provide information necessary decision revascularization , timely manner . This would allow patient avoid duplication test include risk relate coronary angiography ( bleed complication , stroke ... ) relate implantation coronary stent ( stent ) without expect earnings case non-viability . This would also reduce length hospital stay cost due numerous review .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Myocardial Viability : Dual Energy Cardiac CT vs. Cardiac MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Percutaneous coronary intervention recommend stable patient late presentation myocardial infarction , myocardial viability need evaluated procedure . The aim study evaluate sensibility specificity dual-energy CT evaluation myocardial viability comparison cardiac MRI . The experimental procedure limit second CT acquisition perform 10 minute dual energy mode . Sensitivity Specificity delay enhancement &gt; 50 % myocardial thickness provide dual-energy CT evaluate comparison cardiac MRI .</detailed_description>
