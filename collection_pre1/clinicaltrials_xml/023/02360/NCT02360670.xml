	<brief_summary>Stroke affect 125,000 people year UK leave least 50 % disabled . Treatment stroke cause blockage blood vessel ( ischaemic stroke ) , clotbusting drug improves chance good recovery , must give within 4.5 hour onset . Currently small proportion patient arrive hospital within 4.5 hour treat . This largely due uncertainty diagnosis concern risk bleeding associate clotbusting medication . Patients mild improve symptom particular often treated uncertainty relative risk benefit . However , around one third patient go significantly disable . Routine CT scan often show abnormality acute stroke ( take hour become easily visible ) , show extent severity blood flow change ischemic stroke . We wish investigate value additional CT scan give information blood vessel ( angiography , CTA ) blood flow brain ( perfusion , CTP ) undertake randomise trial . Extra scan do scanner involve extra radiation , injection contrast dye , extra time acquire process interpret . The extra scan may allow good treatment decision patient increase diagnostic certainty well assessment stroke severity . However , know whether potential gain well selection justify resource potential treatment delay involve . We investigate whether proportion patient give clotbusting drug differs two scan protocols; whether outcome differ , use standard measure disability . We also investigate whether use different scanner manufacturer ' software affect interpretation scan .</brief_summary>
