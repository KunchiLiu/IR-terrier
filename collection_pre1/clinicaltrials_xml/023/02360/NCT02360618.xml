	<detailed_description>This single centre window opportunity trial . A total 44 patient diagnosis invasive bladder cancer diagnose pathologic evaluation transurethral resection bladder tumor ( TURBT ) specimens meet eligibility criterion enrol study . Study participant receive Metformin 850mg twice daily simvastatin 20mg daily night schedule cystectomy , time period last approximately 12 week less . Pre-treatment TURBT tissue sample Cystectomy post-therapy tissue sample analyze compare . Samples analyze cell proliferation marker determine whether combination metformin simvastatin able produce synergistic effect result decrease growth aggressive cancer cell . The anticipated recruitment period approximately 18 month . Participants study ask attend follow clinic visit study : Baseline Visit : During visit , study doctor conduct physical exam take vital sign well height weight measurement . Blood also draw analysis research purpose . Females child bear potential pregnancy test confirm pregnant . Pregnant woman remove study . We also collect blood sample . Clinic Visits Participants follow-up clinic visit phone interview schedule every 4 week time surgery . At least 1 visit person surgery . At time blood drawn analysis , medication review , confirm take medication adherence study protocol . Day Surgery On day surgery , participant height weight measure , blood drawn analysis research purpose , drug compliance assess . This feasibility study , interim analysis enrollment plan 12 month first patient enrol . The trial prematurely close fails enroll 10 patient 12 month time point . A preliminary pathological analysis perform follow completion 12 month time study initiation . In event enrol patient underwent TURBT diagnosis prior referral , either tissue obtain peripheral center TURBT perform consented repeat TURBT , withdrawn study . Based upon documentation time TURBT , attempt make , possible , obtain tissue section tumor contain cystectomy section . Where possible , representative slide obtain another tumor , available . Study Objectives The aim study evaluate feasibility window opportunity neoadjuvant trial invasive bladder cancer center , determine effect combination metformin simvastatin clinicopathologic marker drug activity patient cohort . Primary Objectives - Feasibility Tumor Proliferation Rate The primary endpoint trial assessment tumor proliferation rate . This investigated analysis change Ki67 tissue stain TURBT tissue sample cystectomy tissue . Marker cell proliferation ; 1 . Ki67 stain This trial also design establish framework evaluate feasibility perform neoadjuvant window opportunity trial use drug potential bioactivity invasive bladder cancer London Health Sciences Center . The goal accrue 44 patient within 18 month trial . A midterm analysis 12 month perform , time trial prematurely close few 10 patient enrol . 2 . Feasibility - goal accrue 44 patient 18 month . Secondary Objectives This study ass rate grade 3 high toxicity define CTCAE 4.03 ( Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ) . If 41 patient enrol complete study , study 85 % power 0.05 detect toxicity rate &gt; 20 % assumed baseline ≤5 % . 1 . Toxicity The following parameter investigate analysis difference tissue stain TURBT tissue sample cystectomy tissue . This aid delineation therapeutic effect combination metformin simvastatin therapy urothelial carcinoma ( UC ) . Marker Apoptosis ; 2 . Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated deoxy uridine triphosphate ( dUTP ) nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) stain Phosphoinositide-3 kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target rapamycin ( PI3K/Akt/mTOR ) pathway readout ; 3. p-mTOR stain 4. p-Akt stain 5. survivin Metformin stimulate activation ; 6. phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase ( p-AMPK ) The following parameter investigate analysis tissue stain cystectomy sample , assume dependent underlying tumor biology affect metformin therapy : PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway regulator , frequently mutate UC , could affect metformin response ; 7 . Phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) stain Cell cycle regulator , frequently inactivate invasive UC , affect metformin response ; 8. p53 stain Tertiary Endpoints The follow parameter investigated analysis difference either value time enrollment day surgery difference frequency treatment control group . Between time enrollment date surgery ; 1 . Serum Insulin 2 . Fasting glucose level 3 . Body mass index 4 . Changes serum prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) Clinical Marker efficacy , show affect prognosis : 5 . Pathologic T0 rate cystectomy vs. historical rate Potential Novel Biomarkers : 6 . Number circulate tumor cell tumor microparticles treatment metformin The following additional stratification analyse data perform order ass result light prior research finding : Stratification Pathologic Markers ; 7 . Stratification pAKT Survivin expression level presence absence PTEN expression 8 . Stratification TUNEL Ki67 status p53 stain 9 . Stratification pathologic marker use absence administration neoadjuvant chemotherapy</detailed_description>
