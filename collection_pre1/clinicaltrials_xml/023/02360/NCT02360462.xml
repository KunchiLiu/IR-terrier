	<brief_title>The Effect tDCS Preoperative Period Hallux Valgus Surgical Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Forefoot deformity important cause foot pain discomfort affect around 80 % general population , predominantly female population . Among teenager adultsÂ´ common forefoot deformity hallux valgus . To achieve deformity heal , surgical treatment need . The transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) non invasive technic , aim central nervous system modulation pain control , become therapeutic option postoperative pain . Experimental study show tDCS revert hyperalgesia induce chronic stress articular inflammatory pain , reduce total knee arthroplasty postoperative opioid consumption single 20 minute session show reduction endoscopic procedure opioid consumption , safety minimal adverse effect . However , tDCS effect preoperative hyperalgesia explore yet sensitize patient , neither anxiety postoperative rehabilitation patient submit hallux valgus surgical correction . In study , choose use tDCS stimulate cerebral cortex due efficacy painful syndrome , non invasive , low cost easy-to-apply technic comparison neurostimulation technics especially , potential counter-regulate mal adaptive neuroplastic alteration associate chronic pain . Objective : evaluate effect tDCS compare tDCS-sham pain control ( visual analog scale score , pain threshold descendent modulator system ) , perioperative anxiety , postoperative analgesic drug consumption rehabilitation patient arthralgia first metatarsophalangeal articulation submit hallux valgus surgical correction . Method : randomize , blind , placebo-sham control clinical trial include 40 female patient , 18 70 year old , candidate hallux valgus surgical treatment combine Chevron + Akin osteotomy due arthralgia first metatarsophalangeal articulation . The patient randomize divide two group treat two tDCS tDCS-sham session 20 minute preoperative period . Expected result : This study evaluate effect tDCS treatment option postoperative pain perioperative anxiety patient submit hallux valgus surgical correction . In case proven efficacy , technic become low cost , easy access , safe effective treatment option patient .</detailed_description>
