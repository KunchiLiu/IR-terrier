	<brief_summary>This study randomize clinical trial last 30 month . A total 300 subject recruit social centre elder locate different district Hong Kong . Baseline clinical examination conduct single calibrate examiner social centre use intra-oral LED light , mouth mirror probe . Subjects randomly allocate three study group receive intervention accordingly . Follow-up examination 6-month interval carry assess clinical outcome , i.e . whether new root caries develop whether active root caries find baseline become arrest ( remineralized harden ) . Photographs arrest lesion take assess colour . Results study provide much need evidence guide dental professional Hong Kong worldwide decide appropriate intervention prevention treatment common dental disease old adult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary secondary outcome study new root caries arrest root caries . A root surface new caries experience record root surface sound baseline find carious lesion fill follow-up examination . Arrested root caries record active root caries find baseline change inactive root caries follow-up . The status root surface record use code recommend International Caries Detection Assessment System ( ICDAS Ⅱ ) Coordinating Committee 2009 . Color arrest root caries lesion classify one four type accord PANTONE® color plate place next lesion ( Fig 1 ) , namely yellow ( 7401U ) , light brown ( 1245U ) , dark brown ( 4635U ) , black ( Black U ) . A mean root caries increment around 0.8 root surface per year control group report previous clinical trial conduct Hong Kong . Thus , study , 30-month increment 2 new decay root surface anticipate . The ratio mean standard deviation root caries increment expect around 1:1.5 . In order show 50 % difference mean caries increment high low value three group statistically significant 5 % significance level 80 % power , 80 subject group require . Allowing drop-out rate 25 % 30 month , total 300 subject ( 100 group ) need .</detailed_description>
