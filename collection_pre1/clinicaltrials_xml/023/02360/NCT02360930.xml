	<brief_title>Vincristine PK PD AYA Population Compared Younger Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study refine PK model planning future definitive study . This pilot study obtain preliminary data pharmacokinetics VCR way differs AYA population compare young child define Tanner stag . Additionally , want determine Calpain level correlate vincristine PK determine use biomarker VRNT . Specific Aim 1 : Develop non-parametric population model vincristine M1 PK child adolescent . Hypothesis : The PK vincristine metabolite M1 differ young child AYA define Tanner stage Specific Aim 2 : Measure repeat serum calpain initiation vincristine four week therapy . Hypothesis : Compared baseline , serum calpain increase administration vincristine . For first time , patient classify base physiologic maturity—rather age—to determine whether adult phenotype associate prolonged vincristine exposure . This increase likelihood detect developmentally-driven difference vincristine metabolism , successful , provide evidence Tanner stag reliable method classify adolescent purpose chemotherapy dose . Further , characterize vincristine PK difference two group , first time examine difference PK M1.We analyze calpain level separate entity Tanner stag . We try establish association calpain vincristine administration , well vincristine induced peripheral neuropathy . However , evaluate association vincristine dose , PK calpain level , adjust age Tanner stage analysis . To account enzyme polymorphism metabolism vincristine , analyze patient CYP3A5 genotype , associated increase clearance vincristine less peripheral neuropathy decrease severity vincristine induce peripheral neuropathy . Additionally , determine vincristine 's PK allow u probe impact polymorphism regard VCR disposition . For follow aim , enroll total 30 patient unified diagnosis acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) ,6 month 21 Induction phase Maintenance phase therapy . Patients stratified phase treatment , classify Tanner stage ≤ 2 ≥ 4 , base physical examination . We plan 15 patient Tanner stag ≤ 2 15 patient Tanner stag ≥ 45 . Each patient receive vincristine weekly x 4 ( Induction ) monthly ( Maintenance ) , standard dose specify treatment protocol . Since PK measurement obtain around single VCR dose ; appropriate include patient ALL two phase treatment . The study conduct single institution , Children 's Hospital Los Angeles ( CHLA ) . From newly diagnose patient Induction phase , collect optimally time blood sample prior 10 minute , 30 minute , 1 hour , 12 hour 24 hour follow first dose vincristine . We also measure serum calpain , candidate biomarker nerve injury , first dose vincristine , 4th weekly dose . For ALL patient Maintenance phase , collect optimally time blood sample prior 10 minute , 30 minute , 1 hour 24 hour follow dose vincristine . In ALL patient Maintenance , 12 hour blood sample feasible since patient treated outpatient setting . We also measure serum calpain level prior vincristine dose , 24 hour 4 week measure vincristine level . The study period ALL patient Maintenance phase complete 4 week initial measure VCR PK level .</detailed_description>
