	<brief_summary>A clear association type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) report . This association independent vascular impairment , therefore , could attribute neurodegeneration trigger accelerated diabetes . At present method identify T2D patient risk develop AD . The retina share many feature brain , therefore , suggest easily accessible way examine pathology brain . In fact , many patient AD present retinal abnormality . However , diagnosis diabetes , condition frequently associate retinal neurodegeneration , consider . On basis , final aim proposal identify diabetic patient risk develop AD base assessment retinal neurodegeneration mean non-invasive test . Specific aim : 1 ) To compare prevalence morphological functional abnormality relate retinal neurodegeneration among three group T2D patient : patient AD , patient Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) patient without AD MCI . 2 ) To assess whether retinal neurodegenerative feature relate severity AD . 3 ) To explore whether combined retinal neurodegeneration diabetic patient AD different functional and/or morphological pattern comparison neurodegeneration secondary diabetes alone . Methods : Case-control study . Retinal neurodegeneration assess mutifocal electroretinogram ( mfERG ) spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) . The potential confounders consider data analysis . Feasibility : A unique multidisciplinary consortium create order warrant feasibility project Expected impact : This innovative approach fill gap currently exist health care system reduce economic burden associate T2D patient AD . In addition , project would backbone future prospective study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A case control study recruitment carry Diabetes outpatient clinic tertiary hospital ( HUVH ) ACE Foundation . The investigator include follow group : 1 ) Type 2 diabetic patient AD ; B ) Type 2 diabetic patient MCI ; 3 ) Type 2 diabetic patient normal cognitive status ; 4 ) Non-diabetic patient AD . The group match age ( ± 5 year ) , gender , risk factor relate AD ( APOE genotype family history dementia ) , diabetes duration Hba1c ( ±1 % ) - last two criterion apply three group diabetic patient . Inclusion criterion : Written inform consent obtain patient ; Age &gt; 65years ; Diabetes duration &gt; 5 year ; HbA1c &lt; 10 % ; No apparent mild non-proliferative DR accord International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale . Exclusion criterion : Patients neurodegenerative disease brain retina ( i.e . glaucoma ) cerebrovascular disease . Sample size calculation : Assuming diabetic patient present around 30 % abnormal mfERG implicit time , consider figure 60 % diabetic patient AD , number patient require group would 25 . This calculation perform take account 2-side risk level 0.05 statistical power 80 % . However , note estimation perform take account variable concern AD . Therefore , foreseeable patient need obtain valid result MCI . Consequently , investigator feel reasonable extend sample 35 subject per group . The study divide two stage ( detail ) : -Stage I : This first step project type 2 diabetic patient AD patient normal cognitive status compare . -Stage II : Type 2 diabetic patient MCI compare patient normal cognitive status AD .</detailed_description>
