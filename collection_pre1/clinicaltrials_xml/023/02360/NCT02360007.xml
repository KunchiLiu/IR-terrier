	<brief_title>Interim Buprenorphine : Leveraging Medication + Technology Bridge Delays Treatment Access</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Agonist maintenance efficacious treatment opioid dependence . Unfortunately , demand treatment far exceed available capacity . An alarm number clinic extensive waitlists treatment slot ( Gryczynski et al. , 2009 ; Peles et al. , 2012 ; Peterson et al. , 2010 ) . Patients remain waitlists year , place elevate risk illicit drug use , criminal activity , infectious disease , overdose mortality period ( Peles et al. , 2013 ; Warner-Smith et al. , 2001 ; Wenger &amp; Rosenbaum , 1994 ) . These delay treatment access represent significant barrier widespread delivery effective opioid treatment , particularly rural area few provider substantial unmet treatment need . One important effort increase access extend interim methadone treatment ( IMT ; i.e. , daily methadone + emergency counsel ) individual await enrollment methadone program . IMT significantly reduce illicit opioid use criminality increase likelihood treatment entry ( Schwartz et al. , 2006 , 2007 , 2009a , b , 2011 ) . However , methadone treatment U.S. limit license specialty clinic , require frequent clinic visit , medication risk diversion , abuse overdose . Hence , methadone 's regulatory pharmacological feature substantially constrain ability IMT expand access opioid treatment . Our overarch goal application develop novel Interim Buprenorphine Treatment ( IBT ) bridge delay treatment access . Our integrative treatment package include five key component , strategically choose maximize patient access pharmacotherapy opioid dependence minimize nonadherence , abuse diversion : ( 1 ) Buprenorphine ( BUP ) : Due pharmacological profile , BUP less risk abuse overdose available without rigid dose regulation require methadone . Thus , use BUP interim-treatment model . ( 2 ) Computerized adherence monitoring ( CAM ) : We use CAM promote medication adherence reduce diversion risk . BUP dose dispensed via state-of-the-art portable device make day 's dose available predetermined time , medication inaccessible . ( 3 ) Mobile health clinical support : mHealth platform use information communication technology deliver patient monitoring , education support beyond confines medical office . Interactive Voice Response ( IVR ) system especially promise provide customized support via phone low cost , consistent delivery , 24-hour availability , privacy convenience . We develop IVR system deliver clinical support branch logic seamless fashion well immediate connection staff crisis service need . ( 4 ) Urinalysis adherence monitoring : We develop automated call-back procedure contact participant via IVR randomly-determined interval notify return clinic provide urine specimen present CAM device inspection . This component provide rigorous efficient method support abstinence adherence extend period lower-frequency visit . ( 5 ) HIV+Hepatitis Education : We develop intervention produce significant improvement HIV hepatitis knowledge . However resource-intensive in-person format may limit utility IBT . We adapt intervention delivery via iPad , state-of-the-art platform portability , sophisticated functionality widespread appeal . The primary aim Stage I Behavioral Integrative Treatment Development application develop novel , manual-based IBT platform increase access opioid treatment . During Months 1-6 refine treatment component use feedback stakeholder . During remain study period , evaluate feasibility , acceptability initial efficacy IBT 12-week proof-of-concept trial 70 opioid-dependent adult wait-listed agonist maintenance randomize receive IBT ( n=35 ) continue Waitlist Control condition ( WLC ; n=35 ) . IBT participant visit clinic every 2 week receive IBT package describe . WLC participant remain waitlist treatment choice complete schedule follow-up assessment IBT participant . WLC participant enter treatment Week 12 offer opportunity cross IBT time , contribute additional within-subject data evaluate efficacy IBT intervention . By facilitate eradication waitlists , propose research represent significant departure status quo stand produce fundamental shift treatment opioid dependence conceptualize deliver . The IBT component highly novel , individually integrative treatment package opioid dependence . This study also first investigate utility IBT patient setting stand benefit include multi-pronged dissemination plan ensure finding readily transport real-world clinical practice . Taken together , propose project produce highly innovative technology-assisted pharmacotherapy protocol widely disseminate increase access life-saving opioid treatment . These aim directly relevant NIDA 's mission improve accessibility , implementation effectiveness drug abuse treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For inclusion trial , participant must &gt; 18 year old , good health , meet DSMIV criterion opioid dependence , provide opioidpositive urine currently waitlisted . To minimize disruption due treatment become available study , limit enrollment join waitlist prior 12 month . Those significant psychiatric medical illness may interfere consent participation exclude , pregnant nursing . Females test pregnancy , participant become pregnant trial , participation terminate assisted access treatment highrisk pregnancy clinic . Those dependent sedativehypnotics exclude , due medical risk notably low success rate sedativedependent opioid abuser ( Stitzer &amp; Chutuape , 1999 ) .</criteria>
