	<detailed_description>The investigator objective compare effectiveness two distinct follow-up strategy promote colorectal cancer screening : prevention coordinator ( PC ) approach vs. automate telephone reminder ( ATR ) system . The investigator adapt successful intervention test Health Literacy Cancer Screening Project [ R01CA115869 ] add follow-up strategy health literacy intervention . In proposed project investigator evaluate two different follow-up approach improve low income patient ' completion initial annual CRC screen use Fecal Immunochemical Test ( FIT ) . Substantial evidence show routine screen prevent colorectal cancer ( CRC ) detect early stage , reduce related mortality . While overall CRC screening rate US increase , rate remain persistently low among uninsured low-income individual , few year education , racial/ethnic minority . Low health literacy link cancer screen noncompliance , high rate advance stage presentation disease health disparity . In response , Department Health Human Services call health information service accurate , accessible , actionable well culturally appropriate . This study implement two-arm , randomize control trial low income , underinsured patient federally qualified health center ( FQHCs ) evaluate compare effectiveness PC ATR follow-up strategy increase CRC screen . All patient recruit study receive evidence-based , literacy appropriate screening material develop use health literacy 'best practice ' simplify FIT kit . Use material show significantly increase CRC screen rate investigator ongoing study . Patients randomize receive either : 1 ) PC follow-up strategy , PC personally remind patient complete mail FIT kit , perceive barrier screen discuss address ; 2 ) ATR follow-up strategy , automate system electronically encourage patient complete mail FIT kit use plain language message . The effectiveness two approach compare 12 24 month .</detailed_description>
