	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial compare memantine hydrochloride whole-brain radiotherapy without hippocampal avoidance reduce neurocognitive decline patient cancer spread primary site ( place start ) brain . Whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) common treatment brain metastasis . Unfortunately , majority patient brain metastasis experience cognitive ( learn memory ) deterioration WBRT . Memantine hydrochloride may enhance cognitive function bind inhibit channel receptor located central nervous system . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Using radiation technique , intensity modulate radiotherapy avoid hippocampal region WBRT , may reduce radiation dose hippocampus help limit radiation-induced cognitive decline . It yet know whether give memantine hydrochloride WBRT without hippocampal avoidance work well reduce neurocognitive decline patient brain metastasis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether addition whole-brain radiotherapy hippocampal avoidance ( HA-WBRT ) increase time neurocognitive failure month 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 measure neurocognitive decline battery test : Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised ( HVLT-R ) Total Recall , Delayed Recall , Delayed Recognition , Controlled Oral Word Association ( COWA ) , Trail Making Test ( TMT ) Parts A B . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether addition HA-WBRT preserve neurocognitive function month 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 separately measure test , HVLT-R Total Recall , Delayed Recall , Delayed Recognition ; COWA ; TMT Parts A B. II . Evaluate potential benefit HA-WBRT symptom burden , measure M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module ( MDASI-BT ) . III . Assessment quality adjust survival cost analysis use five-level version EuroQol five-dimensional ( EQ-5D-5L ) . IV . Compare cumulative incidence progression overall survival WBRT versus HA-WBRT . V. Compare adverse event treatment arm accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) 4.0 criterion . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Collect serum , plasma , image study future translational research analysis . II . Evaluate magnetic resonance ( MR ) image biomarkers white matter injury hippocampal volumetry baseline 6 month potential predictor neurocognitive decline differential benefit HA-WBRT compare WBRT . III . Association symptom burden anxiety/depression neurocognitive function . IV . Evaluate potential correlation prognostic score system Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) recursive partition analysis ( RPA ) diagnosis-specific grade prognostic assessment ( DS-GPA ) neurocognitive function baseline overtime . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive memantine hydrochloride orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 24 week . Patients undergo WBRT daily approximately 2 week ( 10 fraction ) . ARM II : Patients receive memantine hydrochloride Arm I . Patients undergo HA-WBRT use intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) daily approximately 2 week ( 10 fraction ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 month .</detailed_description>
