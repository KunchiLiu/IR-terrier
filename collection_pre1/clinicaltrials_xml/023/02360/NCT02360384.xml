	<brief_title>Caecal pH Biomarker Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) extremely common condition . Between 1.9 3.6 million patient consult healthcare professional IBS year UK ( 1 ) . The total population prevalence much high IBS sufferer non-consulters due perceive lack effective treatment . IBS sub-classified base upon predominate bowel habit , i.e . constipation predominant ( IBS-C ) , alternate bowel habit ( IBS-A ) diarrhoea predominant ( 2 ) . In recent year , several efficacious treatment approach apply IBS include dietary intervention ( low fibre low fermentable oligosaccharide , disacchaÂ¬rides , monosaccharide polyols ( FODMAP ) ) , probiotic ( VSL # 3 ) pharmacological agent ( linaclotide ) ( 3 ) . Whilst treatment approach show efficacy , clear refinement IBS diagnostic algorithm require well target therapy order overcome inherent heterogeneity within IBS population . Bloating distension common vexatious symptom proportion IBS patient . Bloating largely regard subjective sensation abdominal swelling , whereas distension refers observable increase abdominal girth . Bloating associated reduction quality life , cause healthcare seek represent considerable challenge manage effectively . The anaerobic breakdown carbohydrate protein bacteria , largely occur within proximal colon , process know fermentation , principal product short chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) . One propose mechanism bloat distension colonic dysbiosis subsequent mal-fermentation . This support data show large proportion IBS patient improve symptomatically restrict diet 'elemental ' formula 2-4 week thus reduce amount fermentable material intestinal lumen . The direct vivo measurement SCFA concentration human proximal colon technically difficult invasive . Given degree bacterial fermentation directly proportional concentration SCFA , measurement segmental intra-colonic pH inverse surrogate proxy degree fermentation occur within territory . We recently show measurement caecal pH use wireless motility capsule ( WMC ) IBS control patient technical feasible able differentiate two population ( 4 ) . Our study show caecal pH significantly low IBS compare control thus support concept mal-fermentation contribute IBS symptomatology . Importantly , also show caecal pH correlate inhibition caecal contractility lead u propose idea 'caecoparesis ' maybe long sought alteration motor function differentiate IBS patient healthy participant explain IBS preferentially experience pain right colon upper abdomen response balloon distension . TRIAL OBJECTIVES The primary aim study demonstrate caecal pH sensitive reliable biomarker caecal fermentation IBS normalisation caecal pH environment correlate symptomatic improvement IBS patient . We hypothesise normalisation caecal pH environment either dietary intervention linaclotide correlate symptomatic improvement IBS patient . To achieve recruit cohort Rome III define IBS patient sub-divide appropriate IBS type base symptom . We characterise phenotype term gastro-intestinal physiology ( WMC + lactulose hydrogen breath test ) psychological profile . They allocate one ( 2 3 ) treatment arm ( control diet , low FODMAP diet , control diet + linaclotide ) . Each treatment arm last 28 day WMC repeat symptom assess . Secondary aim include characterise motility transit IBS-sub group , determine effect intervention motility transit , comparison ileal caecal pH profile hydrogen / methane breath test data comparison symptom change physiological assessment outcome .</detailed_description>
