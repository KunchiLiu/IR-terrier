	<brief_summary>Rationale . Degludec longer-acting insulin analog compare glargine detemir . In fraction type 1 diabetic patient , insulin glargine insulin detemir may achieve 24h coverage , reflect raise pre-dinner glucose level administer bedtime . As up-titration bedtime long acting insulin increase risk nocturnal hypoglycaemia , clinical problem address additional injection morning . These type 1 diabetic patient may benefit shift twice daily insulin glargine/detemir daily insulin degludec , show extend activity 24h , 48h . Objective . To evaluate effect shift twice daily insulin glargine detemir daily insulin degludec HbA1c glucose profile type 1 diabetic patient period 3 month . Study design . Observational analytic prospective study . Protocol . Type 1 diabetic patient twice daily insulin glargine detemir ( pre-dinner hyperglycemia due suppose glargine/detemir coverage &lt; 24h ) identify enrolled . During run-in period 1 week , investigator collect data HbA1c value IFCC/DCCT-aligned glucose profile use glucose meter . Patients undergo 7-14 day continuous glucose monitoring eventually ( additional 7-14 day ) shift twice daily basal insulin . Patients re-assessed 12 week initiation insulin degludec determination HbA1c 7-14 day continuous glucose monitoring .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Scientific background In type 1 diabetes mellitus , insulin therapy pivotal requirement , order achieve maintain satisfactory glycaemic control , well survival patient . Attaining good glycaemic profile also allow limit impact acute chronic complication . Indeed , demonstrate maintenance HbA1c level close possible 7 % ( 53 mmol/mol ) , even low , help prevent delay development chronic complication . According International Diabetes Federation ( IDF ) statement , HbA1c target young people type 1 diabetes 6.5 % order ensure long life free complication . Pursuing HbA1c goal possibly achieve without excess incidence hypoglycaemia , compromise patient 's autonomic reactivity represent barrier good glycaemic control . For reason , pattern insulin therapy type 1 diabetes intend reproduce close possible physiological endogenous insulin secretion , tonic ( baseline ) phasic ( prandial ) state . This objective typically achieve basal-bolus scheme , subcutaneous administration rapid-acting insulin analogue 3 main meal , 1 injection long-acting insulin supply inter-prandial nocturnal insulinization . Ideally long-acting insulin ensure duration 24 hour administer day . Long act insulin analogue glargine detemir use type 1 diabetes . Clinical experience suggest certain percentage patient type 1 diabetes , administer bedtime ( h22.00 ) , glargine detemir duration le 24 hour , manifest increase blood glucose late afternoon ( h17.00-20.00 ) result pre-dinner hyperglycaemia , phenomenon play regularly different day may inconsistent owe day-by-day variation absorption . This issue clinical management type 1 diabetes , also know `` sunset phenomenon '' , unique solution still represent `` unmet clinical need '' . Possible approach address sunset phenomenon include : ( 1 ) control capillary BG h16.00-17:00 eventual administration extra shot rapid-acting insulin correct tendency hyperglycaemia ; ( 2 ) use second long-acting insulin injection ( usually breakfast lunch ) addition evening ; ( 3 ) replacement ultra-fast insulin lunch pre-mixed insulin contain mix rapid-acting protamine-bound intermediate-acting insulin ; ( 4 ) transition insulin pump therapy ( CSII ) . However , approach limitation : ( 1 ) patient may able control daily capillary BG afternoon , anyhow still subject additional injection ; ( 2 ) two dose long-acting insulin overlap , expose patient increase risk hypoglycaemia time day , patient nevertheless subject additional injection ; ( 3 ) use pre-mixed insulin , variation ultra-fast insulin dose accord pre-lunch BG carbohydrate intake also involve proportional change intermediate insulin fraction , entail risk hyper- hypoglycaemia ; ( 4 ) insulin pump therapy costly , require long therapeutic education special effort patient , suitable patient type 1 diabetes . The choice one approach carry discretion physician , order individualize specific patient 's need . It therefore reasonable search strategy address sunset phenomenon pursue , way could effective , safe convenient patient . In Centre , one common solution sunset phenomenon issue patient eligible insulin pump therapy twice-daily administration long-acting insulin analogue glargine detemir . Indeed , use premixed insulin fit well flexibility require therapy type 1 diabetes , whilst extemporaneous bolus administration often inconstant , make identification phenotype patient difficult . The use twice-daily administration long-acting insulin currently estimate 20-25 % patient , use premixed represent 5-10 % . Insulin Degludec new generation ultra-long acting insulin analogue develop Novo Nordisk A/S recently market trade name TresibaÂ® . It approve Regulatory European Agency ( EMA ) subcutaneous use patient diabetes mellitus currently available European country , include Italy , England , Germany , Switzerland ( EMA/689592/2012 ; EMEA/H/C/002498 ) . Molecular modification insulin degludec monomer include addition hexadecanoyl chain fatty-diacid Lysine-29 B-chain ( B29 ) , deletion Threonine B30 . Degludec basal insulin form soluble multi-hexamers upon subcutaneous injection , result depot insulin degludec continuously slowly absorb circulation lead flat stable glucose-lowering-effect degludec ( see figure 1 ) . During period 24 hour once-daily treatment , glucose-lowering effect degludec , contrast insulin glargine , evenly distribute first second 12 hour . Thus , duration action degludec beyond 42 hour within therapeutic dose range . In phase 3 clinical trial involve patient type 1 diabetes , insulin degludec show similar glycaemic control term HbA1c , significant reduction hypoglycaemia rate , especially night , compare glargine . This also explain low day-to-day within-subject variability rate insulin degludec respect glargine . Given long duration action degludec , time administration flexible glargine detemir . As result , report quality life patient type 1 diabetes significantly improve insulin degludec use . The continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) allow nonstop BG level monitor 24 hour 7 day . This tool help patient well understand food intake , physical activity medication affect blood sugar level , often give possibility well manage diabetes . Many CGMS device alarm indicate BG level go predetermine level . Devices also equip small glucose sensor insert subcutaneously abdomen , detect interstitial glucose level every 5 minute send wireless signal terminal easily apply belt hold pocket . When use blind mode , CGMS record accessible diabetologist , patient , thereby allow doctor early detect problem glycaemic trend ( hypo- hyperglycaemic ) 7 day patient 's normal daily life . It demonstrate CGMS capable detect hyper- hypoglycaemic trend normally unidentifiable traditional SMBG provide glucometer . These system thus valuable scientific clinical support define great detail 24-h glycaemic profile , represent gold-standard evaluation basal insulin efficacy safety . Scientific Purpose The present study aim evaluate whether switch insulin regimen twice-daily administration long-acting insulin glargine / detemir ( combination ultra-fast act insulin analogue main meal ) insulin degludec administration once-a-day improve 24-h glucose profile ( CGM ) glycaemic control ( HbA1c FBG ) patient type 1 diabetes mellitus suboptimal glycaemic control ( baseline HbA1c &gt; 6.5 % ) . Since present research protocol inspire clinical problem without conclusive solution ( unmet clinical need ) , sunset phenomenon , consider appropriate provide control group randomization insulin degludec vs. continuation previous insulin regimen . This protocol represent therefore observational prospective study . A pseudo-control group create include patient willing shift twice daily glargine/detemir daily degludec , patient `` degludec group '' observe 3 month change therapy . Plausibility clinical relevance Results phase 3 clinical trial investigate insulin degludec patient suffer type 1 diabetes mellitus show treatment regimen characterize use once-daily insulin degludec vs. once-daily glargine , association rapid-acting inulin analogue meal , result similar glycaemic control HbA1c , significantly low frequency hypoglycaemia degludec arm . Patients sunset phenomenon , take representative sample Centre , show HbA1c average level approximately 8-8.5 % despite therapy twice daily administration glargine detemir . Therefore , expect transition regimen once-daily ultra-long act insulin degludec could improve glycaemic control , well 24-h profile , without increase hypo rate . This question particular clinical relevance , address context everyday clinical practice randomized-controlled trial . To date , scarcity CGMS derive data efficacy insulin Degludec . Therefore , present study potential good clarify benefit new basal insulin .</detailed_description>
