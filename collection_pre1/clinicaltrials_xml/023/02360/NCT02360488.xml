	<brief_summary>The current study test effectiveness novel home-based telehealth system design improve motor recovery patient education stroke . A minimum 124 subject ( number may large depend rate subject dropout ) arm motor deficit 4-36 week stroke due ischemia intracerebral hemorrhage randomize receive 6 week intensive arm motor therapy ( ) traditional in-clinic setting ( b ) via in-home telerehabilitation ( rehabilitation service deliver subject 's home via internet-connected computer ) . The intensity , duration , frequency therapy identical across two group , subject treatment arm receive 36 session ( 18 supervise 18 unsupervised ) , 80 minute ( include 10 minute break ) , 6 week . The primary endpoint within-subject change arm motor Fugl-Meyer ( FM ) score Baseline Visit 30 Day Follow-Up Visit . Arm motor status focus commonly affect stroke , central importance many human function , strongly link disability well stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telerehabilitation Home Versus Therapy In-Clinic Patients With Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Substantial evidence indicate occupational physical therapy improve outcomes stroke , large dos associate superior outcome . However , many patient receive suboptimal dos therapy reason include cost , access , difficulty travel . This problem likely increase time give age population increase rate patient survive stroke . Telehealth , define delivery health-related service information via telecommunication technology , enormous potential address unmet need . The current study test effectiveness novel home-based telehealth system design improve motor recovery patient education stroke . A minimum 124 subject ( number may large depend rate subject dropout ) arm motor deficit 4-36 week stroke due ischemia intracerebral hemorrhage randomize receive 6 week intensive arm motor therapy ( ) traditional in-clinic setting ( b ) via in-home telerehabilitation ( rehabilitation service deliver subject 's home via internet-connected computer ) . The intensity , duration , frequency therapy identical across two group , subject treatment arm receive 36 session ( 18 supervise 18 unsupervised ) , 80 minute ( include 10 minute break ) , 6 week . The primary endpoint within-subject change arm motor Fugl-Meyer ( FM ) score Baseline Visit 30 Day Follow-Up Visit . Arm motor status focus commonly affect stroke , central importance many human function , strongly link disability well stroke . Telerehabilitation evaluate use assessor-blind , randomize , non-inferiority study design . This study seek establish comparable efficacy two treatment arm base upon non-inferiority margin 2.05 point arm motor Fugl-Meyer scale . Key study feature include enrollment diverse stroke population , standardize blind outcomes assessment , standardized treatment protocol , covariate-adaptive randomization , use active comparator match duration , frequency , intensity therapy . The FDA determine investigation non-significant risk device study . A minimum 5 clinical site participate study . Each clinical site conduct test treatment single central site , although clinical site encourage recruit subject referral hospital . At central study site , Assessment Therapist perform study test , blind treatment assignment ( subject necessity blind ) , Treatment Therapist provide in-clinic therapy well direct home-based telerehabilitation . Potential enrollee may identify several route , example , acute stroke admission clinical site referral hospital , inpatient rehabilitation clinical site referral hospital , mean community-based recruitment . Study conduct highly standardize , include select therapy content , deliver therapy , test . The current study aim critically evaluate utility telehealth approach motor therapy stroke education . Telehealth enormous potential address unmet need grow population stroke survivor .</detailed_description>
