	<detailed_description>Ischemic heart disease heterogeneous condition multiple etiology may contribute imbalance myocardial oxygen supply demand , result depletion myocardial cellular energy store . Management disease state aim primarily improve myocardial oxygen supply revascularization underlie obstructive atherosclerosis , conjunction intervention reduce myocardial oxygen demand . Chronic treatment direct reduce recurrent ischemic symptom . Despite advance anti-thrombotic therapy , coronary revascularization , preventive therapy , risk recurrent event population remain substantial , particular among patient indicator high risk ( e.g . ST-segment depression , arrhythmia ) . Ranolazine piperazine derivative exerts anti-ischemic action without clinically significant effect heart rate blood pressure . At clinically relevant concentration , ranolazine inhibitor slowly inactivating component cardiac sodium current ( late INa ) , may reduce deleterious effect associate intracellular sodium calcium overload accompany may promote myocardial ischemia . Ranolazine available anti-anginal agent patient chronic angina . The Metabolic Efficiency With Ranolazine Less Ischemia Non−ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes ( MERLIN ) -TIMI 36 trial demonstrate safety ranolazine patient ACS also show 's anti-arrhythmic property . In addition safety property ranolazine , study show ranolazine significant anti-ischemic effect patient 's therapeutic dosing . In analysis 6560 patient MERLIN-TIMI 36 , use digital continuous electrocardiographic Holter monitor ischemia ( Lifecard CF , Delmar Reynolds apply patient time randomization remain place 7 day , include hospital discharge ) . Findings show patient treated ranolazine significantly low incidence arrhythmias . Specifically , few patient episode ventricular tachycardia last ≥8 beat , supraventricular tachycardia new-onset atrial fibrillation . In addition , pause ≥3 second less frequent ranolazine . Based report , study antiarrhythmic effect ranolazine warrant . Premature ventricular complex ( PVCs ) frequent occurrence presence ischemic heart disease . A high PVC burden symptomatic occasionally result cardiomyopathy . The mechanism PVCs cause cardiomyopathy symptoms well understood , may relate increase myocardial strain demand . Reduction PVC burden associate improvement ejection fraction symptom . Ranolazine also show reduce PVC burden patient already optimal medical therapy . The estimate minimal number PVCs require associate cardiomyopathy around 10 % . In fact , subject evidence PVCs baseline 12 lead electrocardiogram find significantly high risk cardiovascular event . Current strategies managing complex cardiomyopathy drive arrhythmias complicate intolerance medical therapy well requirement frequent titration development tolerance . Patients ischemic heart disease limit option antiarrhythmic medical therapy . Prior trial flecainide eicainide patient ischemic heart disease control ventricular arrhythmia result significant deleterious proarrhythmic effect current option management line amiodarone significant liver , thyroid , lung toxicity sotalol significant bronchospastic effect well QT prolongation tedious carefully dose set renal insufficiency avoid significant QT prolongation risk proarrhythmia . While ICD therapy appropriate patient reduce ejection fraction evidence unstable ventricular arrhythmias/sudden cardiac death , frequent low level ventricular arrhythmia nonsustained VT frequent PVCs would treat ICD therapy . Escalation traditional nodal therapy beta blocker calcium channel blocker often limit marginal systolic blood pressure and/or symptom . With increase prevalence ischemic heart disease , critically important identify therapy neutral response heart rate blood pressure , good safety profile , reduce ischemia burden ventricular arrhythmia . Ultimately , hope reduce strain induced ischemic heart change . To end , investigation effect ranolazine patient ischemic heart disease elevate burden PVCs great interest .</detailed_description>
