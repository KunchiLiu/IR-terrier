	<brief_summary>Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) cytology and/or fine needle biopsy ( FNB ) histology may use diagnostic work-up intrathoracic intrabdominal lesion unknown origin . Certain lesion ( pancreatic adenocarcinoma ) often well characterized cytology assessment FNA-samples others ( GIST-tumors ) . This study part observational ( early study phase ) part interventional study ( late study phase ) diagnostic accuracy EUS-assisted tissue sample FNA FNB 10-year period tertiary endoscopy centre .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Variables affect diagnostic accuracy EUS-FNA EUS-FNB different case tumor scenario study detail influence medical equipment use ( i.e different type size puncture needle ) , experience endosonographers , cytopathologists pathologist use rapid on-site evaluation cytology sample . Each study case review post-EUS ( accord schedule precis ) regard diagnostic work-up , neoadjuvant treatment , surgery result , clinical follow-up , ( neo ) adjuvant treatment , survival .
