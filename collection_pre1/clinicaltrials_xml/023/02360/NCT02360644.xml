	<brief_summary>This study investigate effect vitamin D deficiency drug metabolism transport patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) healthy control . The central hypothesis vitamin D concentration independently affect metabolism transport function CKD patient . An over-arching goal proposal make drug therapy safer effective reduce significant morbidity mortality patient CKD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : Determine effect vitamin D deficiency repletion xenobiotic clearance vivo . The study mechanistically evaluate function major pathway metabolism transport prospectively study clearance phenotype utilize `` probe '' drug commonly use purpose CKD patient healthy volunteer vitamin D deficient replete state . Bupropion , midazolam , olmesartan , fexofenadine , addition endogenous probe ( N-methylnicotinamide ) , use phenotype major phase I drug metabolize enzyme [ cytochrome P450 2B6 ( CYP2B6 ) , cytochrome P450 3A4/5 ( CYP3A4/5 ) ] , transporter [ multidrug resistance associate protein 2 ( MRP2 ) , P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) , multidrug toxin extrusion protein 1/2K ( MATE1/2K ) ] , respectively . Hypothesis : The vivo function individual pathway xenobiotic metabolism transport affect vitamin D status ( CKD ) . Specific Aim 2 : Determine effect CKD vivo function individual CYPs responsible vitamin D metabolism pharmacokinetics cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) . The research prospectively measure activity CYP450s responsible cholecalciferol metabolism , simultaneously evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) cholecalciferol single- multiple-dose administration CKD patient ( stage 1-5 ) healthy volunteer . Hypothesis : CKD alters activity individual CYPs responsible vitamin D metabolism , lead modify clearance cholecalciferol .</detailed_description>
