	<brief_title>The Influence Different Hydrocortisone Replacement Doses Partitioning Flexibility Ectopic Lipids Patients With Corticotropic Hypopituitarism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The investigator others show long-term hydrocortisone replacement therapy high dose hydrocortisone replacement therapy high dose hydrocortisone replacement ( previously recommend ) associate high mortality . The pathophysiology association hydrocortisone-replacement dose mortality remain unclear . A possible underlying mechanism nonalcoholic fatty liver disease prevalent patient hypopituitarism . Patients non-alcoholic fatty liver disease high risk overall-mortality . It remain establish whether insulin resistance , associate increase intrahepatocellular lipid increase intramusculoskeletal lipid , implicate pathophysiology epidemiological finding . Interestingly , show reduction hydrocortisone replacement dose 20-30mg/d 10-15mg/d resulted loss body fat significant decrease plasma total cholesterol triglyceride concentration . The effect IMCL IHCL far unknown . Patients hypopituitarism hydrocortisone replacement therapy provide unique disease model study short-term effect previously recommend dose ( high dose ) hydrocortisone versus lower dose HC replacement therapy ectopic lipid ( IMCL ; IHCL ) lipid , well subcutaneous visceral fat mass parameter insulin resistance . Combining MRI MR-spectroscopy technique , different fat mass ( subcutaneous visceral ) ectopic lipid repeatedly non-invasively assessed . Objective To investigate impact today 's standard hydrocortisone dosage ( low ) versus previous ( high ) hydrocortisone dosage flexibility partition ectopic lipid depot standardise fat load follow short-term aerobic exercise patient corticotropic pituitary insufficiency . Methods Ectopic lipid measure MR-spectroscopy , separate assessment visceral subcutaneous fat mass perform MR-imaging , standardize exercise capacity test use spiroergometry . Short-time exercise consist 2h aerobic cycle 50 % VO2max . Laboratory analysis include lipid profile , free fatty acid , HOMA-Index , hormone .</detailed_description>
