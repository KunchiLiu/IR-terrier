	<detailed_description>Objectives aim The objective project identify measurable feature atherosclerotic plaque carotids associate plaque progression increase stroke/TIA risk use duplex sonography digital B-mode image analysis . The project aim 1. identify characteristic carotic atherosclerotic plaque ultrasound B-mode associate risk progression stroke/TIA onset - `` vulnerable '' atherosclerotic plaque use 1. visual assessment 2. digital image analysis use computer program 2. determine correlation ultrasound find carotic atherosclerotic plaque B-mode vivo ( endarterectomy ) subsequently vitro ( endarterectomy ) patient indicate carotid endarterectomy use 1. visual assessment 2. digital image analysis use computer program 3. assess correlation histological evaluation composition atherosclerotic plaque obtain carotid endarterectomy ultrasound image atherosclerotic plaque B-mode vitro use 1. visual assessment 2. digital image analysis use computer program 4. compare histological ultrasound finding vitro vivo asymptomatic symptomatic atherosclerotic plaque carotid bifurcation use 1. visual assessment 2. digital image analysis use computer program 5. compare feature asymptomatic symptomatic atherosclerotic plaque carotid bifurcation use 1. sonographic perfusion examination plaque vivo ( application echocontrast agent ) 2. elastography The grant project concordance scope , expect benefit , key objective Programme `` Ensuring internationally comparable level healthcare research use result improve health Czech population secure current need health sector Czech Republic '' sub-objective 1.2.2 . `` The development early diagnosis cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease find treatment modality procedures treatment cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease great therapeutic efficiency great parsimony patient . '' Project design 1 . Patients The project period take 54 month . Total 413 patient atherosclerotic plaque carotid bifurcation internal carotid artery cause arterial stenosis ≥ 30 % detect duplex sonography include study - 152 patient indicated carotid endarterectomy accord currently valid guideline ( American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [ AHA ] , European Stroke Organisation [ ESO ] ) 261 patient indicate conservative treatment . Patients screen enrolled sonographic laboratory Military University Hospital Prague University Hospital Ostrava . Inclusion criterion : 1/ age 30 - 90 year , 2/ sufficient image quality atherosclerotic plaque carotid bifurcation ICA use ultrasound , 3/ independency patient ( 0 - 2 point modify Rankin scale ) , 4/ sign inform consent . Exclusion criterion : 1/ serious disease low probability survival least 3 year , 2/ objective obstacle prevent regular 6-month ultrasound scan . Clinical examination : Physical neurological examination examination carotid artery duplex sonography perform patient baseline every 6 month 3 year . 2 . Sample size calculation The sample size prospective follow-up atherosclerotic plaque base expect 20 % difference echogenicity index ( digital image analysis ) patient new stroke/TIA ( expect 2 % annual risk ) patient without new stroke/ TIA . Pre-study calculation show minimum 261 patient need reach significant difference alpha value 0.05 ( two-tailed ) beta value 0.8 assume 20 % subject lose follow-up . The sample size patient undergo carotid endarterectomy subsequent vitro sonographic histological evaluation atherosclerotic plaque base expect Spearmanʼs correlation coefficient ≥ 0.3 histological sonographic evaluation atherosclerotic plaque ( visual digital image analysis ) . Pre-study calculation show minimum 152 patient need reach significant difference alpha value 0.01 ( Bonferroni correction 5 evaluated factor ) beta value 0.8 assume 20 % plaque suitable evaluation . 3 . Duplex sonographic examination carotid artery Standard duplex sonography cervical vessel focus carotid bifurcation proximal part ICA measurement maximum width atherosclerotic plaque transcranial duplex color-coded sonography perform patient baseline thereafter 6-month period 3 year ( totally 7 examination ) . Examinations perform use high-end duplex ultrasound system ESAOTE MyLab Twice ( ESAOTE , Genova , Italy ) linear probe LA435 ( 10 - 18 MHz ) , vascular preset , scan depth 4.0 cm , 2 focus 2.0 3.0 cm ; transcranial duplex sonography , phase array PA 240 ( 2 - 4 MHz ) use . Free hand sonographic scanning perform B-mode longitudinal transversal plane ( continuous hand move without change probe angle ) . Video sequence longitudinal transversal scan image cross-section plaque subsequent distance 0.5 mm save encode . Visual characteristic plaque ( echogenicity , homogeneity , surface , etc . ) digital image analysis use B-mode Assist System perform video sequence cross-section plaque . Sonographic examination plaque perfusion vivo application echocontrast agent ( SonoVue , Bracco , Italy ) elastography perform least 25 patient . 4 . Carotid endarterectomy Surgery undertaken accord standard protocol use general anesthesia patient center ( &gt; 400 carotid endarterectomy carry last 5 year ) . All patient uninterrupted long-term acetylsalicylic acid therapy ( 100 mg/day ) dual antiplatelat therapy perioperative period . A dose 100 IU per 1 kg body weight unfractionated heparin ( Heparin Léčiva , Zentiva , k.s. , Prague , Czech Republic ) administer routinely least 3 - 5 min flow arrest carotid artery . The plaque carotid bifurcation proximal part ICA remove 1 block artery . Protamin ( Protamin Meda-Ampullen , Legacy Pharmaceuticals Switzerland GmbH , Birsfelden , Switzerland ) dose 1 mL per 2,000 IU unfractionated heparin administer 5 min flow restoration ICA need . Clopidogrel ( Trombex 75 mg , Zentiva , k.s. , Prague , Czech Republic ) administer 5 day surgery ( 75 mg/day ) indicate . 5 . Sonographic examination atherosclerotic plaque vitro All atherosclerotic plaque obtain endarterectomy 1 block examine sonographically vitro . Examination perform use high-end duplex ultrasound system ESAOTE MyLab Twice ( ESAOTE , Genova , Italy ) linear probe LA435 ( 10-18 MHz ) , vascular preset , scan depth 2.0 cm , 2 focus 1.0 2.0 cm . Atherosclerotic plaque extract carotid artery transport box formaldehyde . Each plaque insert open plastic box fill HAES 130/04 Voluven solution ( colloid plasma expander ) . Free hand sonographic scanning perform B-mode longitudinal transversal plane ( continuous hand move without change probe angle ) . Video sequence longitudinal transversal scan image cross-section plaque subsequent distance 0.5 mm save encode . Visual characteristic plaque ( echogenicity , homogeneity , surface , etc . ) digital image analysis use B-mode Assist System perform video sequence cross-section plaque . 6 . Histological processing analysis atherosclerotic plaque All atherosclerotic plaque obtain endarterectomy 1 block process analyse histologically sonographic examination . Visual characteristic plaque digital image analysis use B-mode Assist System perform cross-section plaque .</detailed_description>
