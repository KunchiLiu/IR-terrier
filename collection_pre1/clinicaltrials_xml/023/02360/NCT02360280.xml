	<brief_summary>About one-third depressed patient get good multiple antidepressant treatment . This situation put high burden patient depression due worsen quality life increase health care cost . Difficult-to-treat depression might even worse among Veterans give frequency depressive symptom 2 5 time higher among general US population . A breakthrough discovery happen recent year investigator find one infusion old anesthetic name ketamine show high efficacy rapid antidepressant effect ( sometimes within hour ) last week . The investigator propose study multiple infusion ketamine provide great longer antidepressant effect one infusion . If case , multiple infusion could alternative relieve depressive symptom response multiple antidepressant drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Repeated Ketamine Infusions Treatment-resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study find rapid highly efficacious antidepressant effect single ketamine infusion treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ) . However , single infusion appear insufficient maintain response patient return previous depressive state within week . The strategy multiple infusion increase efficacy sustain antidepressant effect yet systematically evaluate randomize control trial ( RCT ) . The propose study one-center , interventional , efficacy study design determine antidepressant outcome serial ketamine infusion compare single ketamine infusion among Veterans TRD . The investigator hypothesize six infusion superior single infusion ketamine decrease severity depressive symptom maintain response . Participants male/female Veterans ( 18 75 year old ) era military background suffer TRD define failure achieve remission least 2 antidepressant trial different pharmacological class . Potential participant recruit Mental Health clinic screen eligibility use two stage process ( phone/chart review , follow interview ) . Exclusion criterion include post-traumatic stress disorder , psychosis-related disorder , bipolar disorder , alcohol/substance use disorder 6 month prior screen ; unstable medical illness ; serious/imminent suicidal/homicidal risk ; Parkinson 's disease , dementia , seizures ; traumatic brain injury ; contraindicate medication ( e.g. , MAO inhibitor , barbiturate ) ; receive electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) current episode ; pregnancy/nursing . Baseline assessment complete 1-2 week prior start treatment . Participants randomly assign one two parallel treatment condition : 1 ) six ketamine infusion 0.5 mg/kg 2 ) single ketamine infusion 0.5 mg/kg precede five midazolam infusion 0.045 mg/kg . Midazolam choose active placebo give similar pharmacokinetics dissociative effect profile ketamine . Each intervention provide total 12-day infusion-phase Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule . The , follow-up visit occur weekly interval first 4 week , 2-week interval next 8 week , 4-week interval remain 12 week relapse . The primary end point Montgomery- sberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) score 24 hour follow last infusion peak antidepressant effect ketamine occur . Secondary outcome treatment phase include remission define MADRS &lt; 10 , response define reduction baseline MADRS score 50 % . For follow-up period , durability antidepressant response define `` time relapse '' MADRS score &lt; 50 % baseline visit . Independent evaluation depressive symptom severity potential covariates antidepressant effect ( e.g. , pain intensity , level anxiety ) ascertain baseline , several time point infusion period , follow-up . On day infusion , subject arrive morning overnight fast . Hemodynamic measure record every 10 min 1 hour begin 10 min infusion . Subjects receive IV infusion 40 minute . Severity depressive symptom , pain intensity , level anxiety obtain 24 hour infusion . Acute dissociative effect , manic/hypomanic symptom , psychotomimetic effect measure 30 minute start infusion end infusion ( t0+40 min ) t0+120mins t0+180mins . The infusion discontinue event significant adverse event . Procedures subsequent infusion day 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 identical first infusion .</detailed_description>
