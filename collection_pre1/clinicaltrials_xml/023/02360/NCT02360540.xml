	<brief_summary>PERC rule create rule pulmonary embolism ( PE ) without exam , residual PE risk &lt; 2 % . Its safety currently confirm low PE prevalence population north-American . In European high PE prevalence population , show PERC rule use alone associate low clinical probability assess revise Geneva score ( RGS ) safe . In retrospective study , suggest combination PERC rule implicit clinical probability ( gestalt ) could allow use PERC rule . PERCEPIC , observational prospective multicenter study perform France Belgium , test hypothesis . Therefore , 3000 patient include 12 center . Primary outcome rate thromboembolic event death relate possibly related PE patient low implicit clinical probability negative PERC rule ( 8 criterion absents ) . Upper limit confidence interval rate must equal low 3 % consider PERC rule safe combination .</brief_summary>
