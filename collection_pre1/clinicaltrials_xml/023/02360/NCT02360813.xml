	<brief_title>Cognitive Remediation Therapy Within Secure Forensic Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single centre randomise clinical trial evaluate feasibility , effectiveness patient satisfaction cognitive remediation therapy within secure forensic setting patient diagnose schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . The feasibility intervention assess use key indicator rate enrolment , retention patient trial , blind effectiveness , completion rate primary outcome measure . The effectiveness intervention assess use MATRICS consensus cognitive battery , symptom ( PANSS CAINS ) real world functioning ( SOFAS : Social occupational functioning assessment scale ) . The effect cognitive remediation violence risk ( HCR-20 ) , programme completion recovery ( Dundrum 3 &amp; 4 ) also examine , programme completion measure attainments participate additional psychosocial intervention recovery measure stability mental state . Patient satisfaction cognitive remediation therapy assess use consumer construct interview develop Rose et al ( 2008 ) administer social worker involve delivery cognitive remediation . The trial take place Republic Ireland 's Central Mental Hospital ( CMH ) . The CMH secure forensic psychiatric hospital Republic Ireland , population 4.6 million . CMH provide specialise care adult mental disorder risk harm others . After baseline assessment ensure eligibility obtain consent , estimate 60 patient randomise receive fourteen week cognitive remediation versus treatment usual . Patients receive treatment usual offer cognitive remediation upon completion study . Patients allocate cognitive remediation receive three individual session cognitive remediation week one group session , fifty-six session total The focus group session normalise cognitive difficulty patient may experience , receive support help generalise gain . The primary outcome measure MATRICS composite score secondary outcome measure assess real world functioning , symptom , violence risk , programme completion recovery administer baseline , end treatment six month follow . Secondary measure also include feasibility outcomes patient satisfaction cognitive remediation therapy . All evaluator effectiveness measure blind participant treatment condition time assessment . The cognitive remediation therapy principle drive intervention consist nine treatment principle : Principle 1 refers relationship building , Principle 2 refers collaborative goal setting , Principle 3 involve session structure , Principle 4 concern content session , Principle 5 , concern pace session , Principle 6 involve scaffold errorless learning , Principle 7 refers meta-cognitive strategy , Principle 8 involve generalisation gain , finally Principle 9 refers manage ambivalence . The actual therapy involve use combination pen , paper computerise material stimulate patient 's cognitive capacity provide opportunity apply meta-cognitive strategy . The investigator hypothesise feasible carry randomise controlled trial within single centre forensic setting patient report high rate satisfaction cognitive remediation . It also hypothesise patient receive cognitive remediation therapy improvement cognitive performance ( primary outcome measure ) , real world functioning , symptom violence risk time relative patient receive treatment usual ; specifically treatment time interaction . Furthermore hypothesised difference maintain six month follow end treatment . In addition hypothesise patient receive cognitive remediation show improvement time Dundrum programme completion recovery scale compare receive treatment usual . While meta-analytic review demonstrate cognitive remediation therapy beneficial effect cognitive deficit experience patient schizophrenia ( Wykes et al 2011 ) , best knowledge study forensic mental health patient . The current study help answer whether feasible deliver cognitive remediation within forensic mental health set whether acceptable patient . The study aim contribute evidence base psychological intervention within forensic set answer question whether cognitive remediation beneficial effect whether effect maintain time .</detailed_description>
