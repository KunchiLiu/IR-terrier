	<brief_summary>Patients mechanical ventilator medical intensive care unit ( MICU ) extremely weak leg muscle . Currently treatment prevent reverse weakness . Treatments thigh muscle stimulator , call All Stim 2 , improve leg muscle strength help patient regain leg function knee surgery . The purpose present study determine treatment All Stim 2 device also improve leg muscle strength patient mechanical ventilation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect All-Stim 2 Quadriceps Treatments Limb Muscle Strength In Mechanically Ventilated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study determine daily exercise use All-Stim 2 stimulation quadriceps muscle increase leg strength improve outcome ( duration hospitalization , long term mobility , long term disability ) mechanically ventilated MICU patient . The investigator plan randomize patient accept protocol administration either sham exercise ( i.e . placement All-Stim 2 unit legs 30 minute day without activation electrical stimulation program ) active exercise ( placement All-Stim 2 electrode legs stimulate quadriceps muscle rhythmically contract 30 minute day ) . The two group ( sham active exercise ) treat 30 minute day seven day . The effect exercise quadriceps strength assess measure quadriceps force generation ( QuadTw ) response magnetic stimulation femoral nerve . The QuadTw assessment make immediately institution sham active exercise repeat one day conclusion seven day train regimen . Chart review patient follow-up use determine treatment regimen also impact clinical outcome measure , i.e . duration hospitalization .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult patient require mechanical ventilation 48 hour Respiratory failure present The physician caring patient determines patient unstable Use high dose pressor ( 15 mcg/min norepinephrine 15 mg/kg/min dopamine ) Use 80 % FiO2 ( fractional concentration oxygen ) 15 cm H2O ( water ) PEEP ( positive end expiratory pressure ) Presence cardiac pacemaker implant defibrillator Use neuromuscular blocking agent within 48 hour precede test History preexist neuromuscular disease Presence profound uncorrectable hypokalemia ( le 2.5 ) hypophosphatemia ( le 1.0 ) Pregnancy If patient prisoner If patient institutionalize If think patient care withdrawn within 7 day</criteria>
