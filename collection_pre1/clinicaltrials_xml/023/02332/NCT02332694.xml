	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia become increasingly press public health problem United States . Although treatment exist Fibromyalgia , many individual suffer Fibromyalgia adequately respond currently available treatment option , highlight need develop test new intervention disorder . To address press clinical issue , conduct pilot study determine Whole Body Hyperthermia ( WBH ) reduce symptoms adult suffer Fibromyalgia . We plan recruit individual Fibromyalgia receive single session WBH determine single session improve Fibromyalgia symptom whether improvement last least 2 week . To , study include self-report symptom assessment immediately one two week WBH . In addition blood collect time point explore whether WBH change immune system chemical believe contribute fibromyalgia . We intend conduct study 10 individual fibromyalgia receive single treatment WBH complete pre-treatment post-treatment assessment . Given scientific evidence research group WBH may improve depression , anticipate may also benefit adult suffer Fibromyalgia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Whole Body Hyperthermia ( WBH ) Rapid Treatment Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We direct clinical trial Whole Body Hyperthermia ( WBH ) treatment Fibromyalgia . Although yet study WBH Fibromyalgia data indicate WBH effective acute treatment major depression ( MDD ) . Given high overlap symptom Fibromyalgia Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) , reason expect WBH may also benefit Fibromyalgia . The primary objective propose study determine WBH produce improvement core Fibromyalgia symptom , appear MDD . Indeed , preliminary study , single exposure WBH result downward shift body temperature ( Figure 6 ) decrease depressive symptom measure use Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ( know ADS Germany study conduct ) 5 day later ( Figure 7 ) . In addition , follow exclusion one patient bronchopulmonary inflammation show decrease body temperature follow treatment , correlation shift body temperature Î”ADS approach statistical significance ( Figure 9 ) . These preliminary data consistent previous study show 1 ) patient seasonal affective disorder winter depression blunt thermoregulatory cool thermoregulatory cool similar efficiency control subject successful antidepressant response phototherapy ( retina direct projection DRVL serotonergic neuron ) , 2 ) ECT increase circadian amplitude core body temperature , decrease mean core body temperature , particularly nighttime thermoregulatory cool period , 3 ) thermoregulatory cooling , evidence number active sweat gland depressed patient , increase upon clinical recovery , early , follow ECT . We hypothesize relationship preliminary data previous study due dysfunction afferent signal arm thermoregulatory system MDD , specifically warm afferent system project LPB , secondarily , DRVL/VLPAG DRI subsets serotonergic neuron implicate anxiolytic antidepressant action , respectively , normalization warm afferent signal follow treatment . Again give high degree overlap Fibromyalgia MDD , expect WBH may confer therapeutic benefit Fibromyalgia appear MDD . This clinical trial include individual Fibromyalgia ( i.e . normal control ) order determine whether significant effect single treatment WBH administer open manner Fibromyalgia symptom . Based data patient MDD , expect WBH effect Fibromyalgia symptom apparent immediately treatment persist least week . Therefore assess Fibromyalgia symptom prior 1 2 week follow single treatment WBH . To evaluate whether treatment effect longer last also assess symptoms two week follow WBH treatment . Useful preliminary result obtain pilot study compare mildly severely depressed patient receive hyperthermic treatment ( N=11 ) depress patient receive psychotherapy usual ( N=3 ) . Baseline score German language ADS depression scale similar two group ( mean=30.64 , sd=9.18 , N=11 , vs. mean =32.33 , sd=17.04 , N=3 ) . Raw change ADS significantly great hyperthermia group ( mean=-11.91 , sd=6.55 , N=11 , vs. mean=-1.33 , sd=4.51 , N=3 ; t=2.60 , df=12 , P=0.023 ) , result large standardize treatment difference ( Cohen ) 1.69 ( 95 % CI=1.00 - 2.48 ) . Percent change also significant ( mean=-39.4 , sd=18.9 , N=11 , vs. mean=-8.6 , sd=17.0 , N=3 ; t=2.54 ; df=12 , P=0.026 ) , Cohen 1.66 ( 95 % CI=0.93 - 2.39 ) . The percentage hyperthermia vs. psychotherapy group achieve clinical response ( &gt; 50 % reduction baseline ) 27.3 % vs. 0 % , percentage achieve least partial response ( &gt; 25 % improvement ) 81.8 % vs. 33.3 % . These data suggest propose sample size 10 individual Fibromyalgia sufficient identify potential therapeutic effect , assume effect would similar magnitude effect see MDD . To obtain cohort 10 subject complete baseline post-treatment data anticipate enrol 12 15 subject .</detailed_description>
