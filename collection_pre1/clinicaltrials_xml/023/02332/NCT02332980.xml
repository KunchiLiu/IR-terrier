	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Alone With Idelalisib Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Other Low-Grade B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Test efficacy ( overall response rate ) single-agent MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) relapse chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) /small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) ( Arm A ) low grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( B-NHL ) , CLL Richter 's transformation ( Arm C ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Test safety single-agent MK-3475 relapse CLL/SLL ( Arm A ) , low grade B-NHL ( Arm B ) , CLL Richter 's transformation ( Arm C ) . II . Test progression free survival , treatment free survival , duration response time next therapy single-agent MK-3475 relapse CLL/SLL ( Arm A ) , low grade B-NHL ( Arm B ) , CLL Richter 's transformation ( Arm C ) .. III . Test complete response rate single MK-3475 relapse CLL/SLL ( Arm A ) , low grade B-NHL ( Arm B ) , CLL Richter 's transformation ( Arm C ) . IV . Test safety MK-3475 combination signal inhibitor ( either idelalisib ibrutinib ) relapse CLL/SLL ( Arm A ) CLL Richter 's transformation ( Arm C ) . V. Test progression-free survival , treatment-free survival , duration response time next therapy MK-3475 combination signal inhibitor ( either idelalisib ibrutinib ) relapse CLL/SLL ( Arm A ) CLL Richter 's transformation ( Arm C ) . VI . Test overall complete response rate MK-3475 combination signal inhibitor ( either idelalisib ibrutinib ) relapse CLL/SLL ( Arm A ) CLL Richter 's transformation ( Arm C ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess potential association program cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) /programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) /PD-L2 expression tumor T cell and/or PD-L1 soluble level plasma clinical efficacy PD-1 blockade . II . To investigate effect MK-3475 select marker immune modulation immune profile peripheral blood tumor sample . III . Examine T-cell immune synapse function expression/location co-stimulatory co-inhibitory molecule ( include effector molecule ) potential biomarkers response anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy . OUTLINE : ALL PATIENTS ( ARMS A , B , C ) : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive benefit may continue receive treatment additional 12 month discretion investigator . Patients CLL CLL Richter 's transformation experience stable disease without partial remission progressive disease 3 month treatment pembrolizumab proceed treatment continuation phase . CONTINUATION PHASE ( ARMS A C ) : Patients receive pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Patients also receive idelalisib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 OR ibrutinib PO daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 12 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive benefit may continue receive treatment additional 12 month discretion investigator . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
