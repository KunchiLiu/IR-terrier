	<brief_summary>Dry age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) common cause severe visual loss elderly represent unmet need . So far treatment available geographic atrophy ( GA ) , represent advanced dry form characterize expand area outer retinal atrophy correspond absolute scotoma . The foveal retina may spar late course disease , phenomenon term `` foveal sparing '' . However , disease process ultimately also involve central retina lead irreversible loss central vision . While natural history eye GA extensively study regard entire atrophic area , morphology-function analysis `` foveal sparing '' GA particular still miss . Such data need various purpose include future use interventional pharmacological trial aim slow progression GA preserve foveal retina . In study , different image modality accurate detection quantification preserve foveal retinal area assess .</brief_summary>
