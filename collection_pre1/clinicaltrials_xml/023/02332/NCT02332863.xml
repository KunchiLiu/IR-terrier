	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer twelfth common cancer worldwide . Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy patient borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma become standard care associate high rate complete resection ultimately improvement overall survival patient population . Radiation therapy soft tissue organ pancreas difficult , readily visualize radiographically . Image guide radiation therapy ( IGRT ) commonly implement modality deliver high dos radiation direct cancer tissue , reduce collateral damage adjacent healthy tissue . Fiducials , inert radiographic marker typically make gold carbon , place around tumor delineate tumor margin allow IGRT Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) pivotal accomplish IGRT allow precise contour identification target lesion pancreas via placement fiducials . This traditionally accomplish use 19-gauge 22-gauge fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) needle . To prepare needle fiducial placement , one two fiducials manually back-loaded tip needle stylet remove . In order hold fiducials within needle , sterile lubrication bone wax apply . Once pancreatic mass target , fiducial injection accomplish via stylet reinsertion sterile water injection . Currently , back-loading fiducials option prepare delivery fiducials via EUS approach . Difficulties associate fiducial loading deployment increase procedure duration due cumbersome fiducial back-loading , fiducial misplacement &amp; migration , well inability pass fiducial marker needle due endoscope angulation . Observational study sit technical success rate 86-100 % use 19 and/or 22 gauge needle average procedure time 7-12 minute use fiducial back-loading technique . A new mode fiducial delivery recently develop hope circumvent technical issue inherent traditional fiducial marker load deployment . A prototype 22-Gauge EUS needle preloaded four fiducials use porcine model successful deployment 95.6 % time accurate predetermine target . They deem easy pas , relatively easy deploy , easily visualize EUS , excellent fluoroscopic CT visualization . In addition , time deployment average le 60 second . To date , randomize control trial compare total duration time need placement fiducials use technical success traditional back- loading technique fiducial marker new preloaded needle regard EUS base fiducial marker placement IGRT pancreatic cancer . This multicenter randomize control trial . Randomization perform patient undergo Linear EUS fiducial marker placement via traditional 22G back-loaded needle ( Visicoil ) new 22G preloaded needle ( PreLoad4 ) . Multiple endpoint record , include total length procedure , many marker successfully deploy , technical success ( Ease passage delivery system , ease deployment fiducials , EUS visualization delivery system needle , EUS visual appearance fiducials , time fiducial placement define starting time remove needle packaging end time removal needle final marker deployment ) . Fiducial marker location confirm via fluoroscopy time placement 4D treatment planning CT order radiation oncologist simulation . Patients discharge home post procedure recovery . Patients contact home research coordinator endoscopy staff 24-48 hour 7-10 day procedure document immediate delay complication . Patients return IGRT visit , evidence fiducial marker migration record radiation oncologist . Hypotheses Use 22 G preloaded needle EUS guide fiducial marker placement patient pancreatic cancer : 1 . Be deliver least require 60 % less procedure time take traditional back-loaded 22G needle 2 . Improve overall procedure efficiency 3 . Maintain comparable technical success adverse event rate . Primary Aims 1 ) To compare procedure time 22G needle placement three Visicoil fiducial marker 22G needle preloaded fiducial marker . Secondary Aims 1 . To compare adverse event rate 22G needle placement Visicoil fiducial marker 22G needle preloaded fiducial marker 2 . To compare endpoint technical success define proper placement two three fiducial marker pancreatic neoplasm 22G needle placement Visicoil fiducial marker 22G needle preloaded fiducial marker .</detailed_description>
