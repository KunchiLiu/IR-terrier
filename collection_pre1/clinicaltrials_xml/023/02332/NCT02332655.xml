	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine tolerability optimal dose cannabidiol ( CBD ) simultaneous treatment child young adult Sturge-Weber syndrome ( SWS ) drug resistant epilepsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cannabidiol Expanded Access Study Medically Refractory Sturge-Weber Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hope gain understanding utility pure CBD use treatment medically refractory epilepsy SWS open-label , safety dose-finding , study . Recent evidence suggest CBD multiple , beneficial , effect patient ( SWS undergo neurological deterioration ) suffer medically refractory seizure . We hypothesize CBD reduce seizure frequency child young adult SWS therefore help stabilize improve neurologic status.This trial part expand access program , available partnership GW Pharmaceutical , sanction FDA study safety efficacy Epidiolex ( cannabidiol/CBD ) participant SWS medically refractory seizure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants SturgeWeber syndrome brain involvement define neuroimaging ( n=10 subject , male female , age 1 month 45 year age ) following : Documentation diagnosis drug resistant epilepsy evidence failure control seizures despite appropriate trial two AEDs therapeutic dos . Drug resistant epilepsy study define : At least 1 report quantifiable ( cluster innumerable ) define seizure motor sign per month least 3 month prior initial visit period Visit 1 ( Screening Visit ) Visit 2 ( Baseline Visit ) , per data capture daily seizure diary . These focal seizure , focal seizure impair consciousness , myoclonic seizure , generalize , secondarily generalize seizure . Between 15 baseline antiepileptic drug stable dos minimum 4 week prior enrollment . Vagus nerve stimulator ( VNS ) , ketogenic diet modify Atkins diet count toward limit . VNS must stable setting minimum 3 month prior enrollment . If ketogenic Atkins diet , must stable ratio minimum 3 month prior enrollment . Previous subject fail point meet continuation criterion withdraw early may consider reenrollment new subject ID long inclusion criterion meet . The determination whether reenroll make PI sponsor casebycase basis . Reenrollment occur earlier 4 week final , postweaning followup visit old subject ID . Written inform consent obtain patient patient 's legal representative must obtain prior begin treatment . Patients seizures secondary metabolic , toxic , infectious psychogenic disorder drug abuse current seizure relate acute medical illness . Presence nonmotor partial seizure ( without limb facial movement , eye deviation head turn ) Patients require rescue medication Baseline phase 6 day . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition randomization : 1. liver disease cirrhosis , decompensated liver disease , chronic hepatitis [ i.e . quantifiable hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) DNA and/or positive HbsAg , quantifiable hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) RNA ] 2 . Uncontrolled diabetes define fast serum glucose &gt; 1.5 3 . Active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection . 4 . Patients active , bleeding diathesis . Patients major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week study entry . Patients recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) , patient may require major surgery course study . Patients change dose AEDs 4 week screen baseline period . Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 4 week prior study entry . Patients history noncompliance medical regimen consider potentially unreliable able complete entire study . Those foster care , unable keep followup appointment , maintain close contact Principal Investigator , complete necessary study maintain safety . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) laboratory test .</criteria>
