	<brief_title>Pilot Study Percutaneous Irreversible Electroporation Treat Unresectable Hepatic Carcinoma Close Gallbladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatic carcinoma fifth common cancer worldwide large proportion patient unsuitable tumor resection factor poor hepatic reserve ( cirrhosis ) , multicentric tumor near vital structure vessel , diaphragmatic dome gallbladder . Direct ablative treatment include radiofrequency ablation , microwave ( MW ) ablation cryotherapy irreversible electroporation use successful therapeutic choice unresectable patient . At time，Irreversible electroporation ( IRE ) ，which apply novel ablation technology , induce tissue necrosis utilize short pulse high-voltage electrical energy . The technique also many advantage , include Short ablation time , preservation vital structure within IRE-ablated zone , avoidance heat/cold-sink effect , complete ablation well-demarcated margin real-time monitoring IRE ablation .</detailed_description>
