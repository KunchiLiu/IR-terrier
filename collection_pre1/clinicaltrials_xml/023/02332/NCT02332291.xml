	<brief_summary>It difficult achieve remission individual late-life depression ( LLD ) often require aggressive treatment . This challenge part due age-related vascular change common LLD . Successful antidepressant treatment involve change across affective , cognitive , default mode network . We hypothesize LLD , vascular disease adversely affect response antidepressant disrupt connectivity network . The primary goal project characterize focal vascular damage affect regional connectivity response antidepressant . Based past work pilot data , priori focus cingulum bundle uncinate fasciculus . These key fiber bundle connect frontal , temporal , cingulate region involve cognition affective response . Our central hypothesis ischemic damage cingulum bundle uncinate fasciculus contribute structural functional connectivity deficit tract . This result disconnection effect alters function connect region . In turn , increase risk poor response antidepressant . Our approach enroll 130 adult age 60 year diagnosis Major Depressive Disorder . Subjects complete clinical evaluation , cognitive testing , MRI/functional MRI ( fMRI ) session , include fMRI emotional oddball task include attentional affective component . Participants stratify cerebral lesion severity randomize 2:1 ratio double-blinded 8-week trial escitalopram match placebo . Those remit transition 8-week trial open-label bupropion , antidepressant different mechanism action . This allow u determine different distinct circuit deficit affect response antidepressant different mechanism action also account placebo response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals late-life depression ( LLD ) experience high level disability , mortality , poor response antidepressant . The MRI hallmark 'vascular depression ' population significant ischemic white matter lesion ( WML ) severity , find associate poor antidepressant outcome . Despite observation diffuse white matter disease LLD , propose `` disconnection hypothesis '' focal damage fiber tract negatively affect function connect region , resultantly contribute cognitive deficit clinical symptom depression severity negativity bias . Focal WMLs may also reduce likelihood antidepressant response specific antidepressant use act neurotransmitter system project damaged fiber tract . This imply effect tract damage clinical response may differ drug different mechanism action . We propose cingulum bundle ( CB ) uncinate fasciculus ( UF ) key tract LLD component cognitive , affective default mode network contain monoamine neurotransmitter projection . Supporting model , past work implicates CB UF deficit LLD new pilot data associate tract damage poor antidepressant response . In cohort 130 depressed elder test central hypothesis : ) focal CB UF WMLs disrupt connectivity function connect region contribute cognitive deficit affective symptom ; b ) antidepressant act neurotransmitter system project tract less effective . Overall Study Design : After obtain informed consent , assess eligibility . Individuals meet eligibility criterion complete neuropsychological test one-hour magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Subjects randomized 2:1 ratio receive either blind escitalopram identical placebo . After 8 week study drug , assess remission . Those whose depression remit end study participation . Those remain symptomatic transition open-label bupropion 8 week , participation end . We work participant plan clinical care study offer two additional visit facilitate transition . Specific Aim 1 : To characterize effect cingulum bundle ( CB ) uncinate fasciculus ( UF ) WMLs tract connectivity , function connect region , cognitive affective presentation LLD . Hypothesis 1 : Greater CB WML volume associate ) reduce resting-state connectivity frontal , temporal , cingulate region b ) deficits attention , memory processing speed . Hypothesis 2 : Greater UF WML volume associate ) reduce rest state functional connectivity frontocingulate medial temporal region , b ) great depression severity negativity bias . Exploratory Hypothesis : Greater CB WML volume associate failure anterior posterior default mode network node deactivate attentional component fMRI task . Greater UF WML volume associate great medial temporal reactivity functional MRI task . Specific Aim 2 : To determine whether deficit tract structural / functional connectivity predict nonremission antidepressant treatment relationships vary base antidepressant mechanism action . Hypothesis 3 : Nonremission escitalopram predict : ) great WML volume CB UF , b ) reduce rest functional connectivity structure connect CB UF . Greater WML severity reduce functional connectivity tract significantly predict response placebo . Hypothesis 4 : Nonremission bupropion predict ) great WML volume UF CB , b ) reduce rest functional connectivity deficit structure connect UF CB . Exploratory Aims : Expl . Aim 1 ) To determine specific cognitive measure may serve marker focal tract WML damage . Expl . Aim 2 ) To use whole-brain multimodal image approach examine connectivity difference brain region may also predict nonremission antidepressant .</detailed_description>
