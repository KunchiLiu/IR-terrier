	<brief_title>Rest Before Physical Therapy Adolescents With Active Spondylolysis Spondylolisthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spondylolysis stress fracture par interarticularis vertebral arch commonly occur low lumbar spine . Spondylolisthesis forward displacement vertebra , especially fifth lumbar vertebra , commonly occur break fracture . These injury spine extremely common adolescent athlete research report spondylolysis spondylolisthesis account 40 % adolescent athlete ' low back pain . While injury common adolescent population little research guide treatment patient , particularly rehabilitation . Conservative standard care treatment spondylolysis spondylolisthesis injury rest sport , brace lumbar spine , begin physical therapy return sport patient able . There evidence show patient rest 12 week prior return sport , otherwise increase risk injury ( El Rassi , 2013 ) . There currently research suggest begin physical therapy . Physical therapy rehabilitation return sport part standard care , recommendation begin therapy vary widely support evidence . A concern begin physical therapy soon fracture adequate time heal re-injury occur . While concern wait long begin therapy increase muscle atrophy , high fear avoidance belief , unnecessarily long avoidance activity . Currently , Nationwide Children Hospital physician 's vary immediate referral physical therapy 3 + month rest prior begin therapy . By perform retrospective chart review assess time referral therapy patient outcomes gain guidance safe prescribe physical therapy rehabilitation patient spondylolysis spondylolisthesis injury . Currently , research exists guide referral safe physical therapy rehabilitation patient spondylolysis spondylolisthesis injury . By perform retrospective study gain information well guide physical therapy referral time . This may also serve foundation future prospective randomize trial . The two primary objective study : ( 1 ) Does time referral physical therapy affect time full return activity . ( 2 ) To assess safety early referral therapy compare long rest period prior therapy . Safety determine relative risk adverse reaction percent patient able fully return activity . Secondary objective include : Assessing pain early later referral therapy . Number physician visit Number physical therapy visit Compliance We perform chart review spondylolysis spondylolisthesis patient treat Nationwide Children 's Hospital Sports Medicine physicians physical therapist since 12/2009 electronic chart patient begin . As unable track outcome study patient refer outside physical therapy , exclude study . The chart review begin run report patient spondylolysis spondylolisthesis diagnosis 2009 2013 . Variables automatically pull report : Age time diagnosis Gender Treating physician Pain Compliance Sports Played **Any miss variable report gather review patient chart . ** Variables gather review patient chart Diagnosis Level injury Type image Brace Results image Rest Physical Therapy Rest clear return sport Treating physical therapist Number physical therapy visit Number physician visit Variables gather short follow-up survey contact patient . Patients contact phone , mail . Recurrence symptoms Michelli Function Score Modified Odom 's criterion Current level sport participation Patients divide 2 group : Early referral therapy late referral therapy physician . To account fact patient refer physical therapy sooner may less severe injury sub-grouping patient physician . Patients physician median referral rate &lt; 10 week therapy sub-grouped Early referral therapy patient physician median referral time &gt; 10 week sub-grouped Late referral therapy . To account possible change way particular physician treat patient spondylolysis spondylolisthesis physician referral rate assess yearly patient group base calendar year referral rate . For example doctor median referral rate 12 week therapy 2009 , 9 week 2010 , 2010 patient place late referral therapy 2010 patient place early referral group . Data Analysis To assess first primary object ass group difference ( early v late referral PT ) time return sport . We assess group difference use t-test data parametric Mann-Whitney U test data nonparametric . To assess safety early referral therapy compare long rest period prior therapy . We examine relative risk group experience significant recurrence symptom . Secondary Outcomes follow variable assess t-test ( parametric ) Mann-Whitney U ( nonparametric ) continuous data chi-square analysis categorical data . Pain - PT visit - physician visit Michelli Function Score Compliance Descriptive statistic report variable</detailed_description>
