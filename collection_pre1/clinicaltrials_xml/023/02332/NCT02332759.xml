	<brief_summary>The Materna device aim prevent pelvic tissue damage prevent overstretch pelvic floor muscle fiber delivery . The device single use , disposable , mechanical dilator penetrates first 4 cm Â½ vaginal canal gradually expand vagina rest diameter 2-3 cm fully expand size deliver fetus , roughly 8-10 cm . The Materna device use first stage labor , roughly 1-2 hour , hospital Labor Delivery unit , supervision train clinical labor delivery provider</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study To Evaluate The Preliminary Safety And Feasibility Of The Materna Medical Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 80 % woman deliver vaginally sustain vaginal tear , roughly half woman suffer permanent pelvic muscle damage may lead pelvic disorder later life . ( 1-8 ) The consequence vaginal tear acute chronic pain , long recovery time , sexual dysfunction permanent disfigurement . ( 1-4 ) Additionally , woman often say prospect tear one thing fear regard childbirth . Tearing childbirth well document occur delivery , however additional damage discover occurs internally pelvic muscle . It long think childbirth lead factor contribute development pelvic floor disorder pelvic organ prolapse , urinary fecal incontinence . ( 6,9,10 ) In last 10 year , new image study show approximately 20-30 % woman pelvic muscle permanently separate pelvic bone vaginal delivery . ( 5-11 ) In additional 20-30 % case , muscle may remain attached pelvic bone stretch point become functionally compromise One promise idea prevent damage slowly prepare pelvic muscle , labor cervix dilating , order maximize stretch . The previous data preliminary finding Materna suggest follow overall working hypothesis : 1 . Vaginal laceration pelvic floor muscle damage lead increase incidence pelvic floor disorder negative sequela . 2 . Vaginal laceration pelvic floor muscle damage cause strain pelvic muscle vaginal tissue without maximize tissue strain use appropriate viscoelastic relaxation second phase labor . 3 . The incidence severity vaginal laceration pelvic floor muscle damage reduce induce gradual strain vaginal tissue use device-based approach Currently device available U.S. protect pelvic muscle damage childbirth . The Materna device take advantage well-proven biomechanical data field sport medicine orthopedics show tissue viscoelastic , mean slowly stretch easy stretch . Materna aim take advantage biomechanical phenomenon well length first phase labor reduce tension tissue , slowly maximize stretch tissue order prepare delivery less injury . There also evidence show reduce tension pelvic muscle could lead short delivery time , result less stressful healthier delivery baby</detailed_description>
