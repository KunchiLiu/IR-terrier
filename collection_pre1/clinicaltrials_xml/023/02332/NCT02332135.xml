	<brief_title>The Efficacy Safety Microwave Ablation Mild-to-moderate Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary hyperparathyroidism ( SHPT ) common hemodialysis ( HD ) patient . SHPT damage cardiovascular system , bone system , forth . The treatment SHPT HD patient include dietary phosphate restriction , use medicine , parathyroidectomy , microwave ablation , new method boom past decade . However , In mainland China , medical therapy always successful achieve adequate control SHPT . Oral medication limitation well side effect . The patient may suffer injury operation , hypoparathyroidism , recurrence hyperparathyroidism parathyroidectomy . Moreover , fear operation patient also limit development . Thus , microwave ablation may become valuable alternative treatment help control SHPT select patient present enlarged parathyroid gland ( ) visible ultrasonography . Nevertheless , nowadays n't guideline doctor choose use microwave ablation therapy SHPT . Furthermore , different expert different view . Experts Japan consider , SHPT , earlier one take microwave ablation , good may , others think , Just parathyroidectomy , microwave ablation merely use patient whose intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) 800pg/ml , serious symptom . From perspective , proof accept microwave ablation SHPT early stage become well . However , know , disease progress , therapy become increasingly difficult . Since microwave ablation minimally invasive , safe , investigator consider , patient parathyroid nodular diffuse hyperplasia demonstrate ultrasound image radioisotope scan would get benefit undergo microwave ablation instant SHPT diagnose . So , In prospective , randomise control paried clinical trial study , investigator observe efficiency safety microwave ablation hemodialysis patient secondary hyperparathyroidism early stage . First , investigator detect iPTH level patient investigator ' blood purification center . The patient whose iPTH 300pg/ml 800pg/ml parathyroid nodular diffuse hyperplasia demonstrate ultrasound image radioisotope scan chosen involve study . The patient age-matched iPTH 300pg/ml 800pg/ml enrol study . In control group , patient accept vitamin D treat SHPT , accord suggestion K/DOQI guideline . Meanwhile , microwave ablation group , patient accept microwave ablation . Then , patient follow 24 month compare rate achieve target iPTH level accord K/DOQI guideline , change iPTH level MWA , rate subject develop severe SHPT , well calcium phosphorus level , Quality Life mortality group .</detailed_description>
