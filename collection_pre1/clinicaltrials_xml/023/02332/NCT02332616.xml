	<detailed_description>The anti-inflammatory effect glucocorticoid well know . The beneficial effect postoperative pain , postoperative nausea vomit well-documented . Anaesthesia surgery associate dramatic increase inflammatory response . The complement system participate disposal product due inflammatory damage . The complement activation generate proinflammatory mediator amplifies tissue damage inflammation . Glucocorticoid administration prior surgery thought effectively reduce inflammatory response activation complement system . The effect glucocorticoid specific complement marker surgery unknown call investigation .
