	<brief_summary>A grow neurorehabilitation literature suggest intense treatment may desire maximize effect therapy follow neurologic injury . This investigation design facilitate development efficacious , clinically applicable treatment acquire apraxia speech examine effect intensity treatment ( e.g. , 9 hour per week vs. 3 hour per week , hold total number session constant ) group speaker chronic apraxia speech aphasia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Intensity - Apraxia Speech</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research design examine effect treatment intensity outcomes associate establish treatment acquire apraxia speech ( AOS ) . Intensity form dose frequency total intervention duration evaluate Sound Production Treatment ( SPT ) . The investigator examine effect intense dose frequency ( nine , one-hour session per week ) traditional dose frequency ( three , one hour session per week ) . Total number treatment session hold constant allow comparison total intervention duration ( 27 session 3 week versus 27 session 9 week ) . A two-phase , group cross-over design use . Thirty-six participant chronic aphasia AOS quasi-randomly assign one two treatment group - intense first traditional first ( 18 per group ) . One group receive SPT apply intense dose frequency ( SPT-I ) follow SPT apply traditional dose frequency ( SPT-T ) . The group receive treatment reverse order ( SPT-T follow SPT-I ) . A two week treatment interval separate treatment phase . The outcomes interest address change train speech behavior , untrained speech behavior , speech intelligibility patient-rated communicative functioning .</detailed_description>
