	<detailed_description>Purpose : Poverty lack predictable , stable source food two fundamental determinant ill health , include HIV/AIDS . Conversely , episodes poor health death HIV disrupt ability maintain economic stability affect household , especially rely subsistence farming . However , little empirical research examine , , improvements people 's economic status food security translate change HIV vulnerability . The purpose SAGE4Health study therefore evaluate large-scale economic development program implement CARE-Malawi examine mechanism magnitude impact economic livelihood , food security , health . Specifically , study aim examine socioeconomic change may affect vulnerability HIV risk overwhelm rural household subsistence environment . To contextualize study location , important note HIV/AIDS , poverty food insecurity contribute substantially morbidity mortality sub-Saharan Africa . The Republic Malawi , southeastern Africa , bear one heaviest HIV disease burden globally . Poverty endemic Malawi ; half estimate 15 million people live less dollar day . Food insecurity , define uncertain limited access nutritionally adequate food , unable procure food socially acceptable way , aggravate problem Malawi . To good understand context HIV Malawi , determine potential response , important consider HIV within ecosocial framework . Moving beyond conventional focus proximal factor contribute HIV vulnerability , like individual risk behavior , essential intervention address poverty food insecurity interrelate distal factor HIV pandemic , especially country like Malawi . Poverty consistently recognize risk factor food insecurity HIV , food insecurity risk factor poor HIV-related outcome . Increasing critique target limitation proximally focus HIV prevention intervention emphasize need development assessment complex , multilayered structural intervention address root cause causal pathway link social , economic , political environmental factor HIV risk , vulnerability specific contexts.There significant gap knowledge , however , development , implementation evaluation structural intervention . First , integration food security intervention HIV/AIDS prevention program essential curtail HIV/AIDS pandemic improve health quality life among infected resource-poor setting , literature offer little guidance international policy maker , World Food Programme . To knowledge , publish intervention study examine impact economic status food security HIV outcomes Malawi . Second , complex multilevel structural intervention expensive . Typically , non-governmental organization ( NGOs ) , government agency implement . The cost complexity study design would adequately evaluate real-world structural intervention align well typical NIH-funded randomize control trial ( RCT ) model ; presumably could explain dearth research . Third , major challenge remain evaluating impact structural intervention . Few NGO intervention evaluate rigorously rule alternative explanation success . Perhaps importantly , NGO program evaluation involve control group . Further , structural intervention assessment limit either structural variable directly intervene ( social norm condone intimate-partner violence microcredit program use rate ) key HIV health outcome . These research gap development , implementation evaluation structural intervention limit wide dissemination scale-up resource-poor country , service much need . The SAGE4Health longitudinal study represent one first attempt understand mechanisms process change food security economic outcome ( i.e. , income , household asset , livelihood option ) impact HIV vulnerability ( i.e. , HIV risk behavior , malnutrition , HIV infection ) . It also represent one first NIH-funded study base academic-economic development NGO partnership . This type partnership leverage strength NGOs ( i.e. , ability respond quickly crises capacity large-scale , sustainable development work ) excellence HIV/AIDS researcher ' rigorous study design evaluation . In addition examine pathway link distal ecosocial factor HIV vulnerability , study provide important information understanding impact multilevel structural intervention HIV potential sustainable long-term public health benefit . Finally , collaboration provide unique opportunity conduct detail study multilevel intervention scale unlikely support entirely NIH research funding ; effect , use NIH NGO program funding enhance contribution . Description : SAGE4Health five-year academic-NGO collaboration evaluate mechanism magnitude impact multilevel economic food security program ( Support Able-Bodied Vulnerable group Achieve Food Security ; SAFE ) , implement CARE-Malawi . The study conduct rural area Kasungu District central Malawi . Among Malawian adult age 15-49 , approximately 11 % live HIV . In Malawi , 74 % people live international poverty line US $ 1.25 per day . The Malawi economy dominate agriculture sector , employ 80 % population , account 42 % national GDP , supply 81 % foreign exchange earnings contributes significantly national household food security . Aside agriculture , Malawi 's economy also highly influenced foreign aid . Based World Bank Africa Development Indicators 2011 Report , foreign aid account 16.3 % Malawi 's GDP 2009 . Given Malawi 's economy receive substantial amount assistance , great interest donor Malawian government understand type intervention effectively create sustainable change health economic sector . ( see intervention description full detail SAFE intervention ) SAGE4Health Sample 1 : Longitudinal , quasi-experimental , nonequivalent-control group design . Objective : examine impact SAFE intervention economic status , food security , HIV/AIDS vulnerability health-related outcome SAFE program participant ' level . Sample : Participants ( n =598 ) three Traditional Authorities ( TAs ) receive SAFE intervention ( intervention group ) compare 301 participant live three match TAs ( control group , match demographic distance urban center ) receive SAFE . Quantitative data collect three wave : Baseline ( year 2009 ) , 18-month , 36-month follow . SAGE4Health Sample 2 : Random sample community survey cohort sequential design . Objective : check possible threat ( i.e. , external factor Malawi 's national fertilizer seed program introduce period intervention ) internal validity intervention/evaluation examine whether intervention effect result something plausible study period , large community intervention deliver . Sample : 500 randomly select village SAFE TAs direct participant SAFE program ; 500 control TAs , SAFE program implement . Quantitative data collect three wave : Baseline ( year 2009 ) , 18-month , 36-month follow . SAGE4Health Sample 3 : Series in-depth qualitative interview focus group conduct 18 month enrollment near end SAFE program implementation . Objective : understand SAFE participant ' experience program , perception impact perspective phenomenon . Sample : 90 individual participate focus group discussion in-depth interview .</detailed_description>
