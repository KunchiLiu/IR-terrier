	<detailed_description>Human milk consider golden standard infant formula . In human milk infant formula lipid provide 55 % energy infant represent major nutrient baby . The vast majority lipid human milk compose triacylglycerols ( 98 % total lipid ) remainder percent phospholipid . Triglycerides compose glycerol backbone three fatty acid bound . In human milk , palmitate ( 16:0 ) major long chain saturate fatty acid represent 22 % 26 % total fatty acid , esterify approximately 70 % sn-2 position glycerol backbone . Unsaturated fatty acid oleic acid ( 18:1 ) linoleic acid ( 18:2n-6 ) preferentially esterify 1 3 position . In infant formula major source palmitic acid palm oil palm olein palmitate , however , preferentially external 1,3 position , mono- polyunsaturated fatty acid usually esterify 2-position triacylgycerol . The aim study assess safety efficacy infant formula contain 40 % 50 % , respectively , palmitic acid sn-2 position .</detailed_description>
