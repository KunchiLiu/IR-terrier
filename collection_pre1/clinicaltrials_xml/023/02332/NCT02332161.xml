	<brief_summary>Anterolateral thigh ( ALT ) free flap tissue transfer commonly use method head neck reconstruction head neck cancer removal . The procedure involve remove muscle , skin , tissue thigh , may affect leg function . The purpose study determine impact ALT ambulation activity daily live ( ADLs )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Leg Function ADL After ALT Reconstruction Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ALT flap may harvest subcutaneous , fasciocutaneous , musculocutaneous , adipofascial flap . At institution , three surgeon commonly use method free tissue transfer reconstruct defect . In experience , patient follow harvest ALT flap impairment low extremity function result decrease independence transfer , gait ability independently perform ADLs . Consequently , patient receive Physical Occupational Therapy follow surgery number patient go receive therapy rehabilitation facility and/or outpatient . A number study examine donor site morbidity low extremity function follow ALT flap harvest . These study , however , heterogeneous primarily use patient report non-standardized scale outcome measure . Additionally , paucity literature relate Physical Therapy Occupational Therapy outcomes intervention patient population , despite frequent referral patient post-surgical therapy . This investigation utilize Lower Extremity Functional Scale , Functional Independence Measure , dynamometry , video analysis single leg squat walk speed effort well ass affect ALT harvest patient ' functional capacity post operatively . These test valid reliable measure commonly utilized Physical Rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
