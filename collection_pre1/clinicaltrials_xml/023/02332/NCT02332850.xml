	<brief_summary>This study conduct standard Phase 1b , open-label , multi-center study patient relapse and/or refractory Myeloma receive least two prior therapeutic treatment regimens . Throughout Phase I portion study , standard 3+3 dose escalation design utilized . Two dose cohort evaluate escalate dos SAR650984 ( 5mg/kg 10 mg/kg Day 1 15 28-day cycle ) standard dose Carfilzomib ( 20-27 mg/mg2 ) . Once safe dose establish , expansion cohort evaluate safety begin assess activity combination ( SAR650984 ( 5mg/kg 10 mg/kg Day 1 15 28-day cycle ) standard dose Carfilzomib ) . During dose escalation portion study , DLT period first cycle ( 28 day ) Day 1 Day 28 initial study treatment . Expansion Phase Cohort An expansion cohort begin MTD SAR650984 plus standard dose Carfilzomib establish . The Expansion Cohort enroll 18 patient additional safety preliminary efficacy data SAR650984 plus Carfilzomib MTD .</brief_summary>

Must 2 prior regimens/lines therapy maximum number prior regimen prior autologous bone marrow transplant acceptable &gt; 12 week transplantation . A line therapy define course therapy interrupt progressive disease . For example , induction therapy , autologous stem cell transplantation , maintenance therapy without intervene progressive disease one line therapy . Confirmed evidence relapse/disease progression immediately prior MM therapy refractory immediately prior treatment . Refractory disease define nonresponsive ( &lt; minimal response ) active therapy experience disease progression within 60 day discontinuation therapy . Relapsed disease define achievement least minimal response follow disease progression therapy within 60 day discontinue active therapy . Patients may receive prior Carfilzomib ( sensitive , relapsed refractory eligible ) must &gt; 4 week last dosing Carfilzomib . In expansion cohort , least 10 patient required refractory Carfilzomib ( refractory define evidence disease progression receive Carfilzomib within 60 day stop Carfilzomib therapy ) . Patients must measurable disease define least one following : Serum Mprotein ≥0.5 g/dl ( ≥5 g/l ) Urine Mprotein ≥200 mg/24 h Serum FLC assay : Involved FLC level ≥10 mg/dl ( ≥100 mg/l ) abnormal serum free light chain ratio ( &lt; 0.26 &gt; 1.65 ) Quantitative immunoglobulin &gt; 500mg/dL , IgA IgD myeloma protein electrophoresis underrepresents disease burden . Biopsy proven plasmacytoma ( measure within 28 day prior initial investigational agent dose ) . Subject ECOG ≤ 2 performance status OR Karnofsky ≥ 60 % performance status . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) A female childbearing potential sexually mature woman : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month may include patient pregnant negative serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin ( βhCG ) pregnancy test result obtain screening . Pregnancy test require postmenopausal surgically sterilize woman . FCBP must also agree ongoing pregnancy test . Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even successful vasectomy . Females must agree avoid pregnancy study must agree use medically acceptable method birth control determine study doctor participate study least 12 week last dose study medication . Voluntary write informed consent performance studyrelated procedure part routine medical care understanding consent may withdraw subject time without prejudice future medical care . Ability understand purpose risk study provide sign date informed consent authorization use protect health information ( accordance national local subject privacy regulation ) . Inclusion Clinical Laboratories Criteria The following laboratory result must meet within 7 day study drug ( treatment ) administration Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,000 cells/dL ( 1.0 x 10e9/L ) ( Growth factor use within previous 7 day ) Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl ( without transfusion within previous 7 day ) . Platelet count &gt; 50,000 cells/dL ( 50 x 10e9/L ) Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min ( CockcroftGault equation ) Serum SGOT/AST SGPT/ALT &lt; 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serum calcium ( correct albumin ) level ULN range ( treatment hypercalcemia allow subject may enroll hypercalcemia return normal standard treatment ) prior study therapy initiation . Left ventricular ejection fraction ; LVEF ≥40 % ( By echocardiogram MUGA test ) . Diagnosed treat another malignancy within 3 year enrollment , exception complete resection basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ malignancy , lowrisk prostate cancer curative therapy complete resection advance malignancy expectation patient receive curative therapy . Patient receive investigational drug 21 day enrollment ( must &gt; four halflives experimental agent ) . No prior SAR650984 antiCD38 antibody therapy allow . History significant cardiovascular disease unless disease wellcontrolled history myocardial infarction past 6 month . Significant cardiac disease include second/third degree heart block ; significant conduction abnormality , significant ischemic heart disease ; QTc interval &gt; 480 msec baseline ( use Bazett 's formula read local cardiologist ) ; poorly control hypertension ; congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II worse ( slight limitation physical activity ; comfortable rest , ordinary physical activity result fatigue , palpitation , dyspnea ) inability tolerate intravenous hydration necessary study therapy administration . Prior peripheral stem cell transplant within 12 week first dose study treatment Daily requirement corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg prednisone QD equivalent ) Patients evidence significant mucosal internal bleeding Prior radiation therapy chemotherapy within 2 week major surgical procedure within 4 week first dose study treatment . Known active infection require parenteral oral antiinfective treatment , patient complete antibiotic symptom infection resolve &lt; Grade 2 , consider eligible infection standpoint . Serious psychiatric illness , active alcoholism , drug addiction may hinder confuse followup evaluation . Any medical condition , Investigator 's opinion , would impose excessive risk patient . Examples condition include preexist kidney disease ( acute chronic , unless renal insufficiency felt secondary MM ) , hypertension , active seizure disorder pulmonary disease would impose excessive risk patient . Patient hypersensitivity component study therapy include require prophylactic medication . Known HIV seropositivity active hepatitis B C viral infection Neuropathy ≥Grade 3 painful neuropathy ≥Grade 2 ( National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events [ NCI CTCAE ] v4.03 ) Gastrointestinal abnormality , include bowel obstruction , inability take oral medication , requirement intravenous ( IV ) alimentation , active peptic ulcer prior surgical procedure bowel resection affect absorption .</criteria>
