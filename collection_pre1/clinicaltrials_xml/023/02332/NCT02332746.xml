	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore temporal relationship self-worth physical activity ( PA ) participation middle-aged woman ( age 35-64 year ) . We particularly interested predictive role self-worth woman 's daily PA participation . This study include two phase : pilot phase test procedure test phase ass self-worth PA. During test phase , Women receive text message prompt morning , afternoon , even 28 day cell phone . Each prompt include link 11-item mobile Internet-based survey assess momentary PA , self-worth , self-efficacy . Women also concurrently wear activity monitor ( GENEActiv ) objectively measure activity level throughout study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploring Temporal Relationships Between Self-worth Physical Activity Middle-aged Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using ecological momentary assessment , purpose study explore temporal relationship self-worth physical activity ( PA ) participation middle-aged woman ( age 35-64 year ) . This study occur two phase . During initial pilot phase ten woman ask test instrument procedure study . During second phase , test phase , 60-100 woman ask complete daily survey assess self-worth , self-efficacy , PA participation . The result pilot phase use modify instrument procedures test phase commences . During pilot phase , 10 woman ask participate initial intake appointment sign inform consent form , complete baseline questionnaire , receive activity monitor , receive instruction complete daily survey wear activity monitor . Women also ask provide typical daily wake time bedtimes appointment guide sample schedule . Ecological momentary assessment ( EMA ) woman receive two three daily prompt complete short survey use study . Women ask answer seven question assess momentary activity ( 1 ) , self-efficacy ( 1 ) , self-worth ( 5 ) twice per day one week three time per day one week . Five woman assign condition week half sample receives twice per day condition first week half receive twice per day condition second week pilot phase . Women sample twice per day prompt complete assessment 1 ) 15 minute typical wake time report intake appointment 2 ) 90 minute prior typical bedtime . Women sample three time per day prompt one additional time afternoon ( random time 2:00 3:00pm ) . Women prompt complete survey via text message . A link provide text message direct woman mobile compatible Qualtrics survey contain seven item assess woman 's current activity , self-efficacy , general self-worth , knowledge self-worth , emotional self-worth , social self-worth , physical self-worth . At end two week pilot phase , woman ask complete survey provide feedback sample scheme usability mobile survey . Results survey inform modification test phase . During test phase , 60-100 woman ask participate initial intake appointment sign inform consent form , complete baseline questionnaire , receive activity monitor , receive instruction complete daily survey wear activity monitor . Women ask answer eleven question assess current activity ( 1 ) , self-efficacy ( 1 ) , self-worth ( 9 ) three time per day 28 day , depend upon result pilot phase . The three-times daily sample scheme adopt test phase . Therefore , woman receive text message prompt link mobile compatible Qualtrics survey daily morning , afternoon , even . Current activity measure use item modify recent EMA study Dunton colleague ( 2012 ) . Using list option , item ass activity participant engage immediately prior receive prompt . One item Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale ( McAuley , 1993 ) use assess woman 's confidence ability participate daily PA scale 0 % 100 % - `` I able participate physical activity moderate intensity 30+ minute today without quit . '' General self-worth measure use one item general self-worth subscale Adult Self-Perception Profile ( Messer &amp; Harter , 1986 ) . Women choose among four statement indicate feel : `` Which follow statement true feel RIGHT NOW ? It REALLY TRUE I dissatisfy It SORT OF TRUE I dissatisfy It SORT OF TRUE I satisfy It REALLY TRUE I satisfy '' The Women 's Physical Activity Self-Worth Inventory ( WPASWI ) ( Huberty et al. , 2013 ) use measure knowledge , emotional , social self-worth . Women ask extent agree ( strongly disagree , somewhat disagree , somewhat agree , strongly agree ) statement describe knowledge , emotional , social self-worth . One WPASWI item self-worth domain choose pilot phase . Based upon result pilot phase , EMA survey modify test phase two item choose assess domain , total six item WPASWI . Examples include : `` RIGHT NOW - My knowledge physical activity affect way I feel . '' ( knowledge self-worth ) `` RIGHT NOW - I feel important take time physically active today . '' ( emotional self-worth ) `` RIGHT NOW - I need know I friends family support commitment exercise order feel good . '' ( social self-worth ) Two item Physical Self-Perception Profile ( Fox &amp; Corbin , 1989 ) use measure perceive body attractiveness physical condition , important subdomains physical self-worth . Women ask extent agree ( strongly disagree , somewhat disagree , somewhat agree , strongly agree ) follow statement : `` RIGHT NOW - I feel confident appearance body . '' ( body attractiveness ) `` RIGHT NOW - I confident level physical conditioning fitness . '' ( physical condition ) In summary , EMA survey use test phase study include eleven item assess momentary activity ( 1 ) ( Dunton et al. , 2012 ) ; self-efficacy ( 1 ) ( McAuley , 1993 ) , general self-worth ( 1 ) ( Messer &amp; Harter , 1986 ) ; knowledge ( 2 ) , emotional ( 2 ) , social ( 2 ) self-worth ( Huberty et al. , 2013 ) ; physical self-worth ( 2 ) ( Fox &amp; Corbin , 1989 ) . Women also ask wear GENEActiv accelerometer duration participation study ( 14 day pilot phase 28 day test phase ) . All participant receive GENEActiv initial intake appointment return device schedule appointment researcher . Women local Phoenix area receive return GENEActiv mail . As part wear activity monitor , woman also ask log wear time , wake time , bedtime . All participant receive comprehensive feedback time spend sedentary , light , moderate , vigorous activity day . During intake appointment , woman also ask complete full-length questionnaire upon EMA survey develop ( i.e. , Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale [ McAuley , 1993 ] , Adult Self-Perception Profile [ Messer &amp; Harter , 1986 ] , WPASWI [ Huberty et al. , 2013 ] , Physical Self-Perception Profile [ Fox &amp; Corbin , 1989 ] ) , demographic questionnaire , regular PA questionnaire ( Past-Week Modifiable Activity Questionnaire [ Gabriel et al. , 2010 ] ) .</detailed_description>
