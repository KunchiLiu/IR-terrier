	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine treatment Age Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) new medication , rituximab effective . To address issue , investigator propose clinical trial patient late stage disease , poor vision fail treatment conventional mean receive rituximab direct injection affect eye follow improvement structure retina . Age Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause vision loss elderly routine care involve injection eye improve prevent worsen vision . However , patient respond medication currently alternative medication need . One potential medication rituximab , inject eye primary eye cancer , tolerate well lead patient improvement . Investigators obtain baseline eye test plan inject medication eye patient late stage AMD , first place numb drop eye , inject medication directly eye use sterile technique .
