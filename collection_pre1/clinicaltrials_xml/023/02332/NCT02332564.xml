	<detailed_description>CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AND THE BENEFIT OF BYPASSES Despite considerable advance medicine , cardiovascular disease remain number one cause death globally . In industrialized country , coronary artery disease ( CAD ) lead cause death , consequence myocardial infarction ( MI ) . In patient acute coronary syndrome , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) show improve outcomes.2 However , stable CAD , PCI demonstrate reduce incidence myocardial infarction death . Coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) superior PCI patient diabetes multivessel coronary artery disease . CABG significantly reduce rate death myocardial infarction compare PCI , high rate stroke . Furthermore , patient advance coronary artery disease , rate myocardial infarction 60 % low CABG compare PCI . Conceptually , benefit CABG PCI surprising PCI target significant coronary lesion think responsible cause ischemia . However , deleterious effect atherosclerosis typically precede significant luminal vascular narrowing . The vulnerable plaque eventually become culprit plaque ( cause myocardial infarction sudden cardiac death ) typically relatively nonstenotic . Furthermore , due multifocal widespread , plaque vulnerability target , amenable PCI . Conversely , artificial - natural - bypass exert protective effect provide alternative source blood flow myocardial territory potentially affect acute coronary occlusion . Coronary collateral represent pre-existing inter-arterial anastomosis natural counter-part surgically create bypass . In patient chronic CAD , sufficient coronary collateral show confer significant benefit term overall mortality cardiovascular event . EXTRACARDIAC-TO-CORONARY COLLATERAL SUPPLY Commonly , coronary collateral implicitly understood exist coronary artery branch . However , structural existence coronary collateral extracardiac connection confirm anatomical investigation . Pathophysiologically regard potential arteriogenic stimulation , connection internal mammary artery , special interest . Indeed , advent coronary bypass surgery , several clinical study examine usefulness minimally invasive surgery augment collateral flow heart via internal-mammary-to-coronary-artery connection patient angina pectoris . The performed distal bilateral ligation internal mammary artery think improve flow naturally pre-existing anastomosis internal mammary artery coronary circulation . In recently publish work investigator investigate effect temporary balloon occlusion distal IMA coronary collateral function . 180 pair measurement perform 120 patient electively refer coronary angiography . Levels collateral function myocardial ischemia determine two coronary balloon occlusion , first , second without distal IMA balloon occlusion . Coronary collateral function , determine collateral flow index ( CFI ) consistently increase ipsilateral , contralateral IMA balloon occlusion leave anterior descending ( LAD ) coronary artery right coronary artery ( RCA ) . Furthermore , finding corroborate observed reduction ischemia assess sensitive tool intracoronary ECG . However , equivocal finding leave circumflex coronary artery : CFI increase ipsilateral IMA occlusion , level myocardial ischemia unchanged . MYOCARDIAL STEAL VIA INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERIES In investigator ' previous study , coronary occlusion simultaneous distal IMA occlusion always perform first conservative measure false-positive detection internal-mammary-to-coronary artery connection . Repetitive coronary occlusion per se result high collateral flow collateral recruitment reduce ischemia ischemic preconditioning augment collateral function . Conversely , sensitivity employ method reduce might contribute equivocal finding case leave circumflex artery . Moreover , hypothesize mechanism localized pressure augmentation investigate . This study aim characterize prevalence function natural ipsilateral IMA-to-coronary connection , well investigate hemodynamic mechanism coronary collateral function augmentation distal IMA occlusion . In investigator ' last study , increase coronary collateral function response manipulation potential coronary collateral donor ( case , IMA ) take indirect evidence existence IMA-to-coronary-artery connection . Thus , employ distal IMA occlusion serve positive stimulus . Conceptually , additional evaluation negative stimulus could heighten discriminatory power investigation .
