	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis systemic bone disease characterize low bone mass microarchitectural deterioration bone tissue consequent bone fragility susceptibility fracture . Fifty percent woman 20 % men old 50 y.o . osteoporotic fracture ( fragility fracture ) . Fragility fracture define one result low-energy trauma fall body height . A previous fracture important predictor new fracture , especially first 5 year initial fracture . A second fracture particularly devastate hip fracture . Approximately 25 % individual hip fracture die five year half recover pre-fracture status , mean loss ambulation ability independence domestic activity . In addition , fragility fracture generate significant cost health system - annual cost osteoporotic fracture patient older 50 year United States estimate 1.3 billion dollar . Low bone mineral density , measure bone densitometry , well previous osteoporotic fracture , two major risk factor occurrence new fracture . A crucial observation fracture attract fracture , ie , individual fragility fracture twice likely suffer second fracture half patient hip fracture previously break another bone . Therefore , rational approach currently use minimize cost health care effectively short time use firstly strategy prevent occurrence secondary fracture , follow primary prevention strategy . In context , correct identification fragility fracture consequent treatment individual make imperative . However , surprise discourage information despite huge range currently available treatment , patient sustain fragility fracture receive treatment . Vertebral fracture hip undoubtedly great impact walk ability elderly , great attention give two type fracture . Consequently , currently insufficient data epidemiology evolution fragility fracture , also know non-vertebral non-hip fracture ( NVNH ) . Among , distal radius proximal humerus fracture frequent . There type fracture , however , simply ignored medical community : knee insufficiency fracture . The fact literature study even hypothesize type fracture may fragility fracture may , year ago , believe entity osteonecrosis knee . The knee insufficiency fracture usually occur old individual knee osteoarthritis . This study therefore aim evaluate whether relation knee insufficiency fracture osteoporosis . Moreover , expect find fracture may define fragility fracture , elect individual affect prophylaxis occurrence new osteoporotic fracture . BACKGROUND The knee insufficiency fracture usually occur old individual knee osteoarthritis . Currently literature study even suggest hypothesis type fracture may fragility fracture . A possible explanation information gap could fact , year ago , entity believe osteonecrosis knee . Only recently become clear cause pain marrow bone edema occur subtly old individual , fact , insufficiency fracture . This study therefore aim evaluate whether relation knee insufficiency fracture osteoporosis . Moreover , expect find fracture may define fragility fracture , elect individual affect prophylaxis occurrence new osteoporotic fracture . OBJECTIVES The objective study evaluate whether relationship knee insufficiency fracture osteoporosis . EXPECTED FINDINGS Patients knee insufficiency fracture high prevalence osteoporosis general population . Patients knee insufficiency fracture high risk second osteoporotic fracture</detailed_description>
