	<brief_summary>Rational : The world french epidemic obesity diabetes represent major problem public health . The prevalence France , adult population , 15 % correspond 6.9 million people obesity 6 % correspond 3.9 million people diabetes . Morbidly obesity ( body mass index 40 kg/m² ) , serious , frequent . Cardiovascular disease first cause morbidity mortality . The atherogenic dyslipidemia insulin-resistant obese type 2 diabetic patient characterize quartet : elevate plasma triglyceride , low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol , increased proportion small dense low-density lipoprotein , widely explain blood accumulation TRL liver intestine , represent major cardiovascular risk factor . The overproduction intestinal TRL ( apoprotein B48 specific tracer ) constituent recently recognize insulin-resistance atherogenous role intestinal TRL show . In view important overmortality failures medical , nutritional , dietary psychotherapeutic combine treatment , bariatric surgery quickly develop . Two main procedure perform : 1 base exclusively gastric restriction ( sleeve gastrectomy ) one associate malabsorption ( gastric bypass ) . Objectives : The main objective study compare effect surgical procedure differential effect 2 bariatric surgery procedures production clearance rate intestinal TRL . The secondary objective compare effect surgical procedure differential effect 2 bariatric surgery procedures production clearance rate hepatic TRL document potential link expect reduction production surgery loss weight , improvement insulin-sensitivity , change hormone , decrease inflammatory state , change energy expenditure , body composition energy intake . Methods : It multicentric , prospective , comparative study cohort . After identification eligible subject , kinetics ( production clearance rate ) intestinal hepatic TRL perform hospital , use establish stable isotope enrichment methodology ( 5,5,5-D3-L-Leucine ) , 2 group obese patient ( 15 patient per surgery procedure ) , 6 month surgery . Perspectives : A good understanding dyslipidemia obese type 2 diabetic patient factor modulate dyslipidemia may lead develop new dietary and/or drug and/or surgical treatment target enterocyte improve lipid profile patient reduce incidence cardiovascular disease . Moreover , differential effect 2 surgical procedure could help choose best surgical procedure obese type 2 diabetic patient depend lipid profile baseline .</brief_summary>
