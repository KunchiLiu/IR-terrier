	<detailed_description>Background : Infliximab active ingredient drug currently sell trade name Remicade , Remsima Inflectra . Infliximab neutralizes tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) α , chemical messenger ( cytokine ) immune system , belong class drug call `` TNF inhibitor '' . This class drug comprises effective , biological agent use treatment chronic inflammatory disease . The use TNF inhibitor increase , infliximab third bestselling drug value Norway 2013 . By recombinant monoclonal antibody murine region , infliximab associate infusion reaction . 8-55 % patient receive infliximab infusion reaction . Infusion reaction unintended reaction occur infusion drug 14 day . The incidence vary widely different study seem difficult determine due variation report reaction , different definition reaction retrospective data collection . Protective factor , risk factor cause reaction well know . Different treatment strategy use , evidence efficacy varies . Aim : The aim study estimate incidence infusion relate reaction investigate risk factor immunological mechanism infusion reaction infliximab patient chronic inflammatory disease . Primary objective : Estimate incidence infusion reaction patient chronic inflammatory disease receive infliximab Secondary objective : - Evaluate correlation infusion reaction formation antibody infliximab . - Identify individual risk factor infusion reaction infliximab . - Identify immunological mechanism infusion reaction infliximab . - Identify immunomodulatory effect immunological change patient treatment infliximab . Study population : The study prospective , longitudinal study department patient start infliximab switch infliximab one supplier another Western Norway Health Region ( Helse Vest RHF ) invite participate .</detailed_description>
