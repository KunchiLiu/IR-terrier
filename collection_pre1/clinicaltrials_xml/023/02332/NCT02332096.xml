	<brief_summary>Diagnosis treatment sleep apnea continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy show decrease arrhythmia recurrence patient AF follow ablation . However , patient AF undergoing ablation routinely screen sleep apnea , despite estimate sleep apnea prevalence 25 % general population , perhaps high among patient AF . Home sleep test frequently use evaluation sleep apnea .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening Sleep Apnea Patients Undergoing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The American Academy Sleep Medicine consider atrial fibrillation ( AF ) high risk sleep disorder breathing , recommend AF evaluate sleep apnea clinical guideline . However , yet become standard practice . The primary reason sleep apnea remain under-suspected under-diagnosed electrophysiology physician treat patient AF , overnight sleep study cumbersome frequently associate patient discomfort high cost , mechanism coordinate sleep apnea screen treatment referral establish electrophysiology clinic . The gold standard diagnosis sleep apnea overnight polysomnography , typically conduct sleep laboratory , costly cumbersome patient . Home sleep study FDA-approved diagnosis sleep apnea offer patient opportunity assess natural sleep environment , often timely manner . It demonstrate diagnosis treatment sleep apnea reduces risk arrhythmia recurrence follow AF ablation level comparable without sleep apnea . The goal study examine feasibility screening patient undergo AF ablation sleep apnea , refer patient sleep apnea evaluation treatment sleep specialist .</detailed_description>
