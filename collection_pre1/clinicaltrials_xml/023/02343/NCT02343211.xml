	<detailed_description>Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome ( PNS ) remote effect malignant neoplasia neural tissue , directly cause mass lesion , metastasis , infection , ischemia , coagulopathy , metabolic disruption treatment . The symptom sign PNS diverse , usually acute subacute . Onconeural antibody detect serum , sometimes Cerebrospinal Fluid ( CSF ) ; onconeural antibody highly specific identify patient neurologic symptom paraneoplastic syndrome . The frequent one anti-Hu , anti-Yo anti-CV2/CRMP5 . Although known cancer patient may present PNS , neurologic symptom precede manifestation tumor 65 % patient . Currently , autoimmunity postulate underlie pathophysiology PNS . Tumor cell sometimes express antigen normally find nervous system , immunologically privilege site . Onconeural antigen tumor identify foreign immune system immune attack elicit . In subset PNS patient , immune system could also recognize attack onconeural antigen normal nervous tissue . This autoimmune hypothesis pathogenesis PNS support series argument : Onconeural antibody find serum CSF ; Cerebrospinal fluid study show inflammation 93 % patient ; In acute phase paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration hypermetabolism 18F-Fluoro-2-Desoxy-Glucose Positron Emission Tomography ( FDG-PET ) scan increase perfusion Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT ) describe attributed inflammatory change ; Pathological examination nervous system patient anti-Hu associate paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis demonstrate loss neuron affect area extensive T-cells infiltration immunohistochemical study damage neural tissue autopsy reveal inflammatory infiltration . Effective treatment PNS require early clinical suspicion follow rapid diagnosis , detection onconeural antibody , identification underlying tumor . Unfortunately appropriate treatment cancer often unsuccessful improve neurological symptom patient generally leave bedridden death . It 's seem important associate immune treatment never adequately test . Experience immunotherapy modality , corticosteroid , plasma exchange , immunosuppressant human intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) , rely case report , retrospective study , couple prospective study patient generally treat late stage . To date , possible set prospective therapeutic trial evaluate role early immune treatment , administer less 6 month onset symptom , patient . Considerable evidence initial inflammatory stage ( early evolution PNS ) , isolated case report early immunological intervention suggest approach may valid treat disorder . Because IVIg often use neuro-immunological disorder ( ex . first-line therapy Guillain-Barre syndrome , chronic inflammatory demyelinate polyradiculoneuropathy , multifocal motor neuropathy dermatomyositis ) little well know side effect interaction cancer treatment decide use IVIg trial . The Aim study improve neurological impairment function patient early diagnosis various PNS associate well-characterized onconeural antibody anti-Hu , anti-Yo , anti-CV2/CRMP5 . The primary endpoint study percentage patient neurological improvement 3 month immunotherapy IVIg . `` Success '' define ≥ 1 point low score modify Rankin Scale ( mRS ) treatment compare baseline . This prospective , open-label trial explores efficacy drug approve treatment immune-mediated neurological disorder give early evolution PNS associate well-characterized onconeural antibody . A total number 17 patient treat . This multicenter study carry auspex French National Reference Center PNS .</detailed_description>
