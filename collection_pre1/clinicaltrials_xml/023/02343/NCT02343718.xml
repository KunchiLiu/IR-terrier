	<brief_title>Vinblastine Temsirolimus Pediatric Patients With Recurrent Refractory Lymphoma Solid Tumours Including CNS Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vinblastine already approve treatment type cancer child temsirolimus already use treat adult cancer Canada . Temsirolimus show slow growth tumour animal know also slow tumour growth child . Laboratory study suggest give vinblastine temsirolimus may offer good result give vinblastine alone .</detailed_description>
