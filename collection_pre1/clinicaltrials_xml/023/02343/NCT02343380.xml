	<brief_summary>The investigator aim analyze whether eat standard meal evening ( 8:00 pm ) determine individual low diet-induced thermogenesis ( DIT ) different hormonal response consumption meal morning ( 8:00 ) . The primary outcome : intra-individual variation DIT evening morning meal consumption . The secondary outcome intra-individual variation glucose , triglyceride , insulin , free fatty acid , leptin , glucagon-like peptide-1 , acylated ghrelin , adrenalin , noradrenalin , even morning meal consumption .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twenty healthy volunteer ( ten male ten female ) recruit among student graduate attend Department Medical Sciences Turin ( Italy ) take part randomize cross-over trial . Participants randomly receive first standard meal 8:00 week standard meal 8:00 pm vice versa . Eight-h meal ( respectively 12:00 pm 12:00 ) , participant receive standard meal ( without protein supplementation ) home , ask spend bed follow 6 hour . A 24-h urine collection collect day test order determine total urinary nitrogen excretion . The standard meal consist : 100g white bread , 100g ham , 50g cheese , 125g yogurt , 200ml fruit juice , plus 25g protein supplement . The participant must consume meal 25-30 minute . A 30-min basal calorimetric ( Deltatrac II ) exam perform . Participants remain supine position awake motionless hospital bed whole period , except meal , sit eat . At 8:00 ( pm ) , participant consume meal , rest supine position 90 min . Then , second 60 min-calorimetric evaluation do . From first calorimetric exam ( basal ) end second ( post-prandial ) blood sample draw every 30 min . The time schedule adopt case morning meal ( 8:00 ) evening meal ( 8:00 pm ) . The random sequence ( morning/evening , evening/morning meal ) computer-generated , use block different length random order . The following measured : weight , height , waist circumference , baseline every 30-min morning evening test : glucose , triglyceride , insulin , free-fatty acid , leptin , glucagon-like peptide-1 , acylated ghrelin , adrenalin , noradrenalin .</detailed_description>
