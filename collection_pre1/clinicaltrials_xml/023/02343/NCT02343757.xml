	<brief_summary>The early detection preclinical AD early stage AD amyloid imaging could improve diagnosis provide knowledge well therapeutical approach combine best imaging : structural MR sequence newly FDA-approved biomarker amyloid PET imaging , two technique strengths one machine . Specific Aims Hypotheses summarize follow : 1 . To assess image quality diagnostic performance 18F-florbetapir ( AMYVID ) PET/MRI , include direct comparison correspond PET/CT image patient . 2 . To evaluate incremental value use 18F-florbetapir ( AMYVID ) addition 2- [ F-18 ] -fluoro-2 deoxy-D-glucose ( FDG ) versus FDG alone . Does quantification plaque burden correlate degree neuronal degeneration depict FDG well clinical severity ? 3 . To determine plaque burden quantitatively 18F-florbetapir ( AMYVID ) PET ( form PET/CT PET/MR ) use novel software develop specifically brain application ; Computer-Aid Diagnosis Dementia amyloid image - CAD4D-amyloid</brief_summary>
