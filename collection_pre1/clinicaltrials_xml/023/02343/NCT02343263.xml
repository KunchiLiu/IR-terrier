	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate effect combine two intervention already use institution reduce post-operative pain follow tonsillectomy adenotonsillectomy . The standard care institution leave tonsillectomy wound bed expose heal one two week . At many institution , surgeon inject topically apply local anesthetic bupivacaine hydrochloride tonsillectomy wound bed help reduce post-operative pain . At institution , surgeon apply layer fibrin sealant , derive protein help form blood clot blood , tonsillectomy wound bed order cover site reduce irritation exposure wound bed . Use fibrin sealant additional benefit potentially reduce postoperative bleeding ( hemorrhage ) rate . Both post-tonsillectomy use bupivacaine ( injection topical ) use topical fibrin sealant application study previously scientific literature ; study show clear benefit , others show significant reduction pain use . No study document harm . The purpose study evaluate efficacy infuse bupivacaine anesthetic fibrin sealant prior application tonsillectomy wound bed . In way , combine product would function sort `` medicate bandaid '' cover painful wound bed slowly deliver entirely safe total dose bupivacaine wound bed reduce post-operative pain . The hypothesis study application bupivacaine-infused fibrin sealant 1 ) reduce post-operative mean pain score child undergo tonsillectomy adenotonsillectomy use validate pediatric pain score system , 2 ) reduce post-operative hemorrhage rate , 3 ) reduce post-operative vomiting , 4 ) reduce total dos post-operative pain medication narcotic pain medication require , 5 ) expedite recovery determine return normal diet activity level . The question specific study include : 1 ) Does bupivacaine-infused fibrin sealant significantly reduce mean postoperative pain score compare fibrin sealant alone compare leave wound bed open heal ? , 2 ) Does bupivacaine-infused fibrin sealant significantly reduce mean postoperative tonsil hemorrhage rate compare fibrin sealant alone compare leave wound bed open heal ? 3 ) Do child receive bupivacaine-infused fibrin sealant require less pain medication compare fibrin sealant alone leave wound bed open heal ? , 4 ) Do child receive bupivacaine-infused fibrin sealant return normal diet normal activity sooner compare fibrin sealant alone leave wound bed open heal ? , 5 ) Do parent child receive bupivacaine-infused fibrin sealant make less call clinic physician call compare fibrin sealant alone leave wound bed open heal ? After discussion risk benefit perform tonsillectomy adenotonsillectomy per routine , parent offer ( child meet inclusion criterion elaborate ) participate research study . This discussion take place either clinic encounter patient sign surgical procedure day surgery . The Informed Consent Statement review parent/patient either surgical staff , resident investigator , clinic nursing personnel include IRB proposal individual perform discussion parent . If parent agreeable participate study question ask exclusion criterion meet , child enrol . The child randomize one three treatment arm elaborate application . Randomization arm include either : 1 ) leave wind bed open heal , 2 ) application unaltered fibrin sealant , 3 ) application bupivicaine-induced fibrin sealant . Children undergo tonsillectomy adenotonsillectomy per routine , conclusion surgical procedure either 3 treatment option perform . For child clinical concern sleep disorder breathe obstructive sleep apnea sleep study , surgical procedure may also involve direct laryngoscopy bronchoscopy perform prior tonsillectomy adenotonsillectomy . During laryngoscopy bronchoscopy , airway level mouth branch windpipe lung inspect small rigid camera ( endoscope ) ; floppiness/collapse ( laryngomalacia ) supraglottis ( tissue vocal cord ) observe , child undergo laser supraglottoplasty remove floppy tissue relieve obstruction . If child laryngomalacia supraglottoplasty perform , child exclude study . Exclusion time base creation additional wound bed throat could weaken ability determine application fibrin sealant bupivacaine-infused fibrin sealant effective . If direct laryngoscopy bronchoscopy , laryngomalacia observe supraglottoplasty perform , child continue treatment arm randomize . After inclusion , randomization , proceed treatment base study arm child randomize , parents/participants receive standardized post-operative discharge instruction regard pain medicine regimens diet well envelope contain pain assessment questionnaire complete 3 time daily 10 day mean document pain score among data point . The parent receive pre-addressed , pre-stamped envelop facilitate return data researcher . Currently clinic nurse call family patient approximately 2-3 week surgery inquire child ensure family desire follow appointment one make . Parents child include study receive similar phone call approximate time frame either clinic nurse surgical staff resident investigator , additional specific question regard post-operative bleeding pain control document research purpose . Additionally , phone call , parent remind complete return post-operative pain assessment sheet provide pre-addressed , pre-stamped envelope receive day surgery .</detailed_description>
