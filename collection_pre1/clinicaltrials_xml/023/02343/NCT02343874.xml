	<brief_summary>The prevalence alcohol-related disorder general population around 10 % . The relationship use healthcare service , cost amount alcohol consume general population unknown . Because alcoholism major public health problem , significant determine prevalence consumption primary user relationship dose alcohol health care cost . This information may allow implementation preventive strategy reduce consumption aim reduce morbidity healthcare expenditure . A cross-sectional study carry . Patients 17 year old , treat primary healthcare center Catalonia available data alcohol consumption January 2010 December 2012 include . Clinical sociodemographic data collect . Health service use health care cost 2013 collect SIDIAP ( The Information System Development Research Primary Care ) database . A positive relationship gram alcohol consume per week use resource health expenditure expect also level risk alcohol consumption . There descriptive analysis clinical data sociodemographic variable . A multivariate analysis do see relationship alcohol consumption health care cost health care service utilization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study describe association alcohol consumption use health care resource health care cost Catalonia , region Spain . A cross-sectional study do . Patients recruit study attend primary health care whose alcohol consumption register electronic medical record 1st January 2011 31st December 2012 . At Baseline ( 31st December 2012 ) , sociodemographic data clinical data record , health care utilization cost obtain year 2013 . Two different register use sociodemographic , clinical health service utilization indicator cost . Information life style factor ( alcohol tobacco consumption , body mass index ) , demographic information like ecologic MEDEA index , sick-leave cost obtain Information System Development Research Primary Care ( SIDIAP ) database . This clinical database anonymized record almost 80 % Catalan population . General practitioner record alcohol consumption two different way ( quantitative categorical information ) . A quantitative variable define gram alcohol per week categorical variable measure risk alcohol consumption ( none , low risk , risky drinker ) . The type risk define follow ( No drinker ; Low drinker ( men drink &lt; 280g per week alcohol woman drink &lt; 179g per week ) ; Riky drinker ( men drink &gt; =280g per week woman drink &gt; =170g per week alcohol , men drink 5 drink per occasion , woman drink 4 drink per occasion ; men drink &lt; 280g per week alcohol woman drink &lt; 179g per week time work heavy machinery take medication could interfere alcohol ) ) . Sociodemographic data ( age sex socioeconomic status ) clinical data ( hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipemia , obesity , psychiatric disease , clinical risk group diagnosis wholly attributable partly attributable alcohol ) obtain central register ( Morbidity Register ) provide Catalan Health service . From register data health service utilization collect . These indicator include : number cost outpatients visit doctor , nurse social worker primary health centre ; hospital admission , emergency room visit , mental health outpatient visit , specialist referral . Data acute chronic hospitalization analyse use three indicator : cost , number admission hospital day , define number day stay hospital . Three type hospital include administrative system : general ( acute ) hospital , rehabilitation hospital psychiatric hospital . The patient 's diagnosis admission also register . Using category Jones colleague , distinguish entry diagnosis wholly attributable alcohol ( e.g. , alcohol dependence alcoholic liver cirrhosis ) , entry diagnosis partly attributable ( acute chronic ) , related alcohol . Also information medication expense seak-leave cost include . Quality check , SIDIAP database , identify duplicate patient identification perform centrally time SIDIAP database update . Furthermore , check logic value perform unexpected value dismiss . A part , number paper publish validity SIDIAP cod various condition . The quality consistency central Catalan register good built-in validation detect problem inconsistency variable . In addition , system periodically externally validated ensure quality data , data use control payment service provider . Descriptive analysis sociodemographic clinical data carry . Analysis variance ( ANOVA ) t-students test use compare continuous data , chi-square analysis categorical variable . Bonferroni correction use multiple comparison . A probability level 5 % less consider statistically significant . Poisson regression sensitivity analyse negative binomial regression do . Linear regression do analyze relationship gram per week alcohol health cost . Data analyse Statistical Analysis Software .</detailed_description>
