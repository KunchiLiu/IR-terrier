The investigator hypothesize preschool child receive health promotion educational program demonstrate high composite KAH score control . The investigator hypothesize high proportion preschool child receive health promotion educational program eutrophic ( B ) control . The investigator hypothesize preschool child receive health promotion educational program show high level exercise physical activity ( E ) healthy diet ( A ) control . For Aim 2 , 600 preschool child recruit 20 school Harlem , NY , perform 2:1 ( 2 intervention : 1 control ) cluster randomization school . The preschool child , teacher parent/caregivers receive intensive educational program period five month . The primary assessment mention Aim 2 occur five month . At time , control school crossover receive educational program next five month . Aim 3-Sustainability , 3rd 4th year : To evaluate sustainability impact preschool-based health promotion educational program KAH-BEA preschool child .

For Aim 3 , 600 preschool child continue follow receive educational intervention end grant period ( 36 month ) . The intent follow child beyond grant period ( separate intramural/extramural funding sought ) , do previous study Colombia Spain conduct investigator . The completion project allow assessment effectiveness multilevel approach intervene child 's environment aim alter early life system prove effective improving health habit child caregiver . The long-term expectation intervention reduce adolescent adult obesity child lead improve CVD outcome .</detailed_description>
