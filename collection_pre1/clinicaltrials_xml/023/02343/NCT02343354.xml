	<brief_summary>Women gestational diabetes ( GDM ) increase risk develop type 2 diabetes ; child show insulin resistance diabetes compare offspring mother without diabetes pregnancy . An increase diabetes risk also observe among partner adult prediabetes/type 2 diabetes . The investigator pilot-tested program diabetes risk reduction among woman within 5 year GDM pregnancy ( MoMM program ) . The investigator enhance program engage directly partner ( MoMMii program ) . In MoMMii , 66 couple history GDM mother participate multimodal diabetes prevention program include healthy meal preparation training , discussion eat physical activity behaviour develop home environment facilitate healthy habit , pedometer-based step count monitoring , participation family-based activity ( frisbee , soccer ) well individual exercise ( e.g. , use exercise equipment , floor resistance exercise ) . Participants encourage communicate session study personnel one another create family support network . All mother father participate five session six month . The investigator examine change health-related behaviour , blood pressure , glucose level , insulin sensitivity/resistance mother father .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The MoMMii Study . Diabetes Prevention Intervention Families With Past Gestational Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal project determine , among family history gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) mother prior five year , family-based multimodal health behaviour intervention ( group cook eating/physical activity counselling , telephone-based app text support , build peer within-family social support health behaviour change ) lead reduction post 75g glucose load serum glucose value mother father . The previous MoMM pilot study demonstrate 8 % reduction mother , similar magnitude observe large diabetes prevention trial conduct among adult impair glucose tolerance ( Tuomieltho et al , N Engl J Med 2001 ) . MoMMii ascertain expansion family-based approach amplifies effect mother demonstrate impact father child . Thus , MoMMii shift focus mother family . A systematic review meta-analysis show diabetes risk share spouse ( Leong et al , BMC Medicine , 2014 ) . GDM also confer high risk insulin resistance overweight offspring . Thus , project plan create collaborative home environment facilitates choice consistent diabetes prevention family member . Sixty-six family recruit GDM clinic McGill University Health Centre centre . Five in-person session ( meal preparation training , eat physical activity counsel ) take place month PERFORM Centre , Concordia University . Each session involve discussion strategy achieve healthy eating , hands-on meal preparation , group-based physical activity . Sessions engage couple well mother father separately . 'Healthy living ' concept integrate on-site childcare structure ( meal preparation , game , video ) . The intervention team include dietitian kinesiologist . A health coach facilitate networking among participate family development lay group leader sustain health behaviour change session post program . Outcomes evaluated mother , father ( e.g. , fast post load glucose insulin resistance measure , fruit/vegetable intake , step count , eat behaviour , blood pressure ) offspring ( dietary/physical activity habit ) .</detailed_description>
