	<detailed_description>Chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) common problem cause disability high economic burden globally well Nepal . There consensus treatment CLBP , however motor control exercise good evidence improvement pain disability CLBP population , whereas transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) common treatment choice evidence . But , know supervise motor control exercise ( SMCE ) TENS add benefit home exercise program ( HEP ) commonly prescribe mode exercise . We plan conduct three arm randomize control trial answer question compare effect SMCE , TENS HEP versus SMCE HEP versus HEP alone disability pain two week six month follow . Three way-mixed model analysis Variance ( ANOVA ) use statistical test . Appropriate post hoc analysis do compare within group group difference .</detailed_description>
