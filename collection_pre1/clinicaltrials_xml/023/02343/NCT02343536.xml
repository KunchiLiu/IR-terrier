	<brief_summary>The goal study identify dose schedule CC-486 safely administer R-CHOP . To evaluate safety maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) maximal administer dose ( MAD ) CC-486 combination rituximab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone ( R-CHOP ) subject high risk ( IPI 2 ) previously untreated DLBCL Grade 3B FL . Also , determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) CC-486 administer alone combination R-CHOP explore preliminary efficacy CC-486 plus R-CHOP 2007 International Working Group ( IWG ) criterion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety oral azacitidine ( CC-486 ) combine R-CHOP ( treatment regimen normally use treat Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma Grade 3B follicular lymphoma ) . This study also propose explore pharmacokinetics oral azacitidine administer combination R-CHOP assess effect drug human body , well ability CC 486 combination R CHOP effect response tumor associate Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma Grade 3B follicular lymphoma , . Oral azacitidine combination R-CHOP approve treatment Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma Grade 3B follicular lymphoma use study investigational . Various dose level investigation treatment administer subject enrol study . This study separate three period : Screening Registration , Treatment Follow-up period . Before patient receive study drug doctor perform test find whether he/she participate study . This do Screening Period . If patient treat physician determine patient eligible participate study , patient register study assign receive one investigational dose level oral azacitidine . The Treatment period start patient receives first dose study drug . The maximum time patient receive study treatment 5 month . The intent patient complete 6 cycle treatment . Each cycle 21 day . The Follow-up period start patient 's treatment complete discontinued reason . The patient few exam , test visit enter follow-up period . These visit every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically confirm previously untreated DLBCL Grade 3B FL , [ doublepositive BCL2 cMYC ] transform lymphoma . Transformed lymphoma FL marginal zone lymphoma , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) [ Richter Transformation ] allow long prior antilymphoma therapy kind administer . 1 . A formalin fix paraffin embed lymph node tumor biopsy specimen must submit Screening Period . The specimen must acquire surgical core needle biopsy ( ≥ 2 core baseline ) ; material fine needle aspiration acceptable . 2 . Fresh core biopsy , frozen , must perform start therapy submit storage . This optional subject biopsyaccessible site consent procedure . In case prior fix formalin paraffin embed ( FFPE ) biopsy available , specimen also use diagnostic confirmation . 3 . No prior antilymphoma therapy . However , subject bulky disease , systemic symptom , compressive disease , rapidly progress adenopathy , prephase treatment 1 mg/kg/day prednisone , equivalent , maximum 7 day permit prior Cycle 1 Day 6 discretion Investigator . In exceptional case , clinically indicate , high dose steroid and/or slightly long duration allow purpose urgent symptom management , subject consider eligible . A washout period apply . However fresh core biopsy mention perform start prednisone . 2.
