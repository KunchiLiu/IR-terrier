	<brief_summary>The incidence type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) young child ( age &lt; 5 year ) rise . The burden responsibility disease management rest parent caregiver check blood sugar , administer insulin , monitor diet physical activity maintain tight glycemic control . This occur vulnerable time life child 's behavior unpredictable , T1D difficult control , parent stress elevate . Despite behavioral intervention demonstrate success reduce rate parent stress improve child behavior , improvement young child 's glycemic control sufficiently achieve . The investigator ' research attempt achieve goal development pilot innovative behavioral intervention T1D parent young child . The focus intervention improve young child 's nutrition physical activity use parent consultant delivery intervention phone text messaging . The study conduct two phase . In Phase 1 , 10 primary caregiver young child ( &lt; 5 year ) diagnose T1D least 6 month receive intervention assess 3- 6- month post baseline index behavior glycemic control ( include continuous glucose monitoring ) . Participants also complete in-depth survey provide qualitative well quantitative data . At end Phase 1 , data analyze use develop intervention Phase 2 . During Phase 2 , 60 participant child randomize either revise intervention ( treatment ) usual care ( control ) condition . Intervention component include : T1D management support deliver trained lay parent consultant , T1D parent strategy specific improve eating physical activity behavior deliver bachelor 's level behavioral assistant via telephone text messaging . Biomedical psychosocial measurement ( include HbA1c , physical activity , nutrition , mealtime behavior , parent stress , quality life ) occur baseline 3- 6-months post baseline . The result work ultimately lead program improve young child 's T1D management glycemic control translate variety clinical practice setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Healthy Eating , Physical Activity , Glycemic Control Young Children With T1D</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Young child ( &lt; 5 year ) comprise grow number person diagnose type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) -- costly , chronic illness [ 1 , 2 ] . Early age diagnosis poor glycemic control early year increase risk development serious diabetes-related complication ( ref ) . Thus , year represent critical period establish proper pattern T1D management glycemic control young child [ 7 ] . In addition young child 's daily reliance parent T1D care , blood glucose ( BG ) monitoring insulin administration , careful attention must pay diet physical activity regulation . Behavioral intervention support enhance T1D management among parent young child potential significant impact child 's glycemic control well developmentally important outcome , may reduce immediate long-term clinical public health burden T1D complication . Although multicomponent behavioral intervention parent young child T1D demonstrate potentially promising psychosocial outcome [ 8-10 ] , concomitant improvement child 's glycemic control intervention remain elusive . Two critical area yet address directly intervention promotion healthy eating engagement consistent physical activity young child , behavioral strategy support parent challenge occur multiple time daily ( e.g. , meal/snack , physical activity experience ) . The current proposal utilizes extensive expertise multidisciplinary team refine pilot innovative translatable intervention target eat physical activity behavior directly associate glycemic control young child ultimately adopt outside research setting . The investigator ' prior successful clinical research effort engage parent young child T1D behavioral intervention ( R01 DK080102 ) place unique position design pilot intervention ultimately well poise run future full-scale efficacy trial . The current proposal shifts investigator ' prior intervention ' focus away parental stress instead highlight behavioral strategy promote healthy eating engagement consistent physical activity , well nutrition physical activity link glycemic control . Based upon positive preliminary data investigator utilize novel assessment ( accelerometry , personal activity monitor ( PAM ) , continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) ) intervention component ( parent consultant train intervention telephone counselor ) , intervention deliver via telephone in-person . The investigator follow iterative mixed method approach refine intervention Phase 1 Phase 2 . During phase 1 investigator pre-pilot intervention examine feasibility acceptability 10 parent ( child age 1-5 yr minimum 1 yr duration diabetes ) . The investigator use qualitative interview , questionnaire , objective ( CGM , accelerometry ) data help refine key intervention component discern best area intervention target ( i.e. , low glycemic breakfast different meal ; plan physical activity increase step daily live ; PAM accelerometry ) . This phase include solicit feedback advisory board lead refinement intervention manual procedure . During phase 2 investigator execute pilot randomize trial evaluate whether glycemic control developmentally-important outcome ( child feed physical activity ) young child T1D favorably impact . Phase 2 include 60 parent ( child age 1-5 yr ) randomly allocate either intervention ( n=30 ) standard care ( n=30 ) . Assessments complete 3 time ( T1 , T2-immediately post intervention , T3-6 month post-intervention ) . Clinical , biological , behavioral diabetes outcomes measure . Specific Aims trial : Aim 1 . Pilot test refine innovative feasible assessment intervention component T1D control young child , examine acceptability impact parent young child . At conclusion Phase 1 , Aim result innovative intervention program , support state art assessment tool preliminary data . The investigator hypothesize intervention associate high feasibility acceptability , improve T1D management , reduction behavioral challenge relate eat physical activity . Aim 2 . Determine intervention 's efficacy improve young child 's glycemic control parent 's management eat physical activity behavior . The investigator hypothesize Phase 2 pilot demonstrate relative usual care , intervention evidence 1 ) Significantly good glycemic control ( i.e. , HbA1c &lt; 8.5 % high percentage BG level 100-200 mg/dl range , per ADA recommendation ) 2 ) Significantly few child feeding activity behavior problem ( e.g. , food refusal , dawdle mealtime , physical inactivity ) . 3 . Mediating effect eat physical activity glycemic control also explore . Aim 3 . Explore feasibility program implementation large scale efficacy trial , clinical T1D management . Using purposeful sample subset parent intervention condition , investigator use qualitative interview examine impact intervention , assist refinement prior large scale trial . The investigator also interview advisory board member include member health care team gather system- provider-level data key capacity inform integration intervention patient/work flow anticipation large efficacy trial .</detailed_description>
