	<brief_summary>The aim study compare standard spirometric evaluation methacholine challenge test plethysmographic , interrupter technique force oscillation technique ( FOT ) evaluation airway resistance . The study group consist patient refer methacholine challenge test . All patient undergo spirometric , plethysmographic , interrupter technique FOT examinations - inhalation aerosol . Patients also undergo measurement nitric oxide concentration exhale air laboratory test , include : blood count , measurement serum C-reactive protein , sodium , potassium , creatinine , immunoglobulin E N-Terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) concentration . The investigator intend ass , plethysmographic , and/or interrupter , and/or FOT measurement bronchial reactivity replace standard spirometric assessment . Plethysmography , interrupter technique FOT much easy perform patient . Furthermore , two technique less dependent patient 's motivation cooperation ability . Thus , usage FOT , interrupter technique and/or plethysmography bronchial hyperreactivity testing could make methacholine challenge test comfortable available patient . The investigator also go analyze relationship exhale nitric oxide functional index bronchial hyperreactivity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bronchial hyperreactivity define increased respiratory tract responsiveness multiple stimulus , result bronchial muscle constriction bronchial lumen narrow . Bronchial hyperreactivity hallmark asthma , however may also present disease , e.g . chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Methacholine challenge test one bronchial reactivity assessment method . Methacholine act directly bronchial smooth muscle receptor cause bronchoconstriction . Bronchial reactivity increase presence active inflammation . Methacholine challenge test commonly perform patient symptom suggestive asthma negative result spirometry reversibility test . The measurement methacholine concentration cause 20 % forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) decrease post-inhalation spirometry ( PC20 ) standard method hyperreactivity evaluation . However , method could use among patient able perform acceptable spirometry . Furthermore , result spirometry might influence level compliance motivation patient . Moreover , whereas spirometric methacholine challenge test high negative predictive value , positive predictive value relatively low . Thus , diagnostic utility pulmonary function test assess methacholine challenge test evaluation . In plethysmography airway resistance perform tidal breathing . The increase specific airway resistance 200 % decrease specific airway conductance 40 % methacholine inhalation , respectively , propose cut-off level bronchial hyperreactivity diagnosis . In forced oscillation technique ( FOT ) , sinusoidal oscillation emit membrane airway lumen airway resistance calculate basis change air flow induced oscillation . The increase resistance decrease reactance FOT typical bronchoconstriction . Finally , also interrupter technique ( IT ) allow airway resistance assessment tidal breathe . In IT , airway resistance calculate basis mouth pressure measure directly airway occlusion airflow measure directly occlusion . The aim study compare standard spirometric evaluation methacholine challenge test plethysmographic , interrupter technique force oscillation technique ( FOT ) evaluation airway resistance . All patient undergo : - clinical examination - measurement nitric oxide concentration exhale air - spirometric , plethysmographic , interrupter technique FOT examinations - inhalation inhalation aerosols - follow laboratory test : blood count , measurement serum C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , sodium , potassium , creatinine , immunoglobulin E NT-proBNP concentration Patients provide write spoken information study protocol . Written inform consent obtain every patient .</detailed_description>
