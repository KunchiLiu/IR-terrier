	<brief_summary>This phase II study drug , pegylated interferon alfa-2b ( PEG-IntronTM ) , use treat brain tumor pediatric population . Researchers want see treatment PEG-IntronTM stop tumor growth patient juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas optic pathway glioma . The purpose study : - To learn response pegylated interferon - To learn side effect pegylated interferon - To learn MRI image patient Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytomas Optic Pathway Gliomas . - To learn quality life patient treat pegylated interferon</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Pegylated Interferon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low grade glioma common pediatric central nervous system malignancy occur different part brain . Patients undergo gross total resection , usually hemispheric tumor , excellent prognosis surgical resection alone . Patients gross total resection achievable significant risk disease progression . Therefore , patient benefit adjuvant therapy . Multiple chemotherapy regimens show efficacy residual tumor , 50 % patient experience recurrence . Radiation show effective therapy treatment tumor . Because concern regard radiation toxicity especially young child , progression despite chemotherapy , novel approach need . This protocol represent attempt measure efficacy safety use pegylated interferon patient recurrent , refractory Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytomas ( JPA ) optic pathway glioma . It provide different approach commonly use treatment modality . The objective study determine response child chemotherapy-refractory progressive JPA optic pathway glioma ( OPG ) weekly pegylated interferon alpha-2b . The secondary objective include good identify toxicity weekly pegylated interferon alpha-2b ( PEG-Intron™ ) pediatric patient unresectable , refractory , recurrent JPAs optic pathway glioma , evaluate various magnetic resonance image technique noninvasive monitoring metabolic biologic change tumor evaluate quality life patient recurrent , refractory JPAs receive therapy pegylated interferon alpha-2b ( PEG-Intron™ ) . The primary end point determine response rate . A two-stage design select evaluate response rate . If treatment demonstrate least 25 % response rate , researcher would consider promise regimen study . A response rate le 5 % consider evidence unpromising regimen . Seventeen evaluable pediatric patient JPA OPG accrue . If least 3 responder see among 17 patient , consider evidence promise response rate evaluation .</detailed_description>
