	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I trial study side effect best dose human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -resistant gene modified stem cell treat HIV-positive patient undergo first-line treatment Hodgkin Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma . Stem cell collect patient HIV-resistance gene place stem cell . The stem cell re-infused patient . These genetically modify stem cell may help body make cell resistant HIV infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety feasibility infuse gene modify , HIV-protected hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ( HSPC ) ( C46/CCR5/P140K lentiviral vector-transduced autologous HSPC ) standard first line treatment lymphoma patient HIV infection . II . To determine dose BCNU ( carmustine ) combination O6-benzylguanine ( O6BG ) result selection vivo gene-modified HIV resistant cell minimal toxicity . III . To estimate effect HIV infection presence HIV-resistant blood cell measure genetic marking vector sequence highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) interruption . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate molecular clonal composition gene-modified cell standard first line treatment . II . Evaluate molecular clonal composition gene-modified cell O6BG/BCNU . III . Determine correlation level O-6-methylguanine deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methyltransferase ( MGMT ) ( P140K ) mark toxicity response O6BG/BCNU chemotherapy . IV . Characterize toxicity associate vivo selection . V. Describe time disease progression , progression-free survival , treatment-related mortality , time neutrophil platelet recovery , incidence infection . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Effect procedure latent HIV reservoir . II . Effect procedure HIV-specific immune reconstitution . OUTLINE : MOBILIZATION AND HSPC COLLECTION : Between second last course plan standard chemotherapy , patient undergo mobilization peripheral blood stem cell filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) begin day last dose chemotherapy previous cycle . If CD34 cell count peripheral blood least 24 hour recovery nadir &gt; = 40 CD34 cells/mcL , patient undergo apheresis collection next day . If CD34 cell count &lt; 40 CD34 cells/mcL , plerixafor SC administer patient undergo apheresis collection next day . Patients undergo apheresis total apheresis product &gt; = 4.0 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg collect . STEM CELL INFUSION : Patients receive CD34+ gene modify C46/CCR5/P140K lentiviral vector-transduced autologous HSPC intravenously ( IV ) within 2 8 day , later 28 day , completion last cycle first line treatment lymphoma . IN VIVO SELECTION WITH O6-BENZYLGUANINE AND CARMUSTINE : Between 28-180 day infusion gene-modified HSPC hematopoietic recovery first line treatment , patient &gt; = 1 % &lt; 10 % gene mark cell receive O6-benzylguanine IV 1 hour , immediately follow BCNU ( carmustine ) IV , follow 7-8 hour later O6-benzylguanine IV 1 hour . Treatment continue additional course provide gene marked cell meet exceed 10 % peripheral blood cell absence unacceptable toxicity . STRUCTURED TREATMENT INTERRUPTION ( STI ) : Patients achieve &gt; = 10 % gene mark cell 2 consecutive month follow infusion gene-modified HSPC CD4+ cell count total lymphocyte count baseline begin STI HAART 12 week . Patients resume HAART one follow criterion occurs : 1 ) CD4 count &lt; 350 cells/mcL decline percent CD4+ cell &gt; 33 % baseline three consecutive evaluation ; 2 ) increase HIV RNA &gt; 100,000 copies/mL two consecutive evaluation ; 3 ) 12 week pass since discontinuation HAART ; 4 ) discretion infectious disease ( ID ) consultant principal investigator ( PI ) . * If patient efavirenz-containing regimen , HAART discontinue simultaneously . If patient efavirenz-containing regimen , patient switch efavirenz integrase inhibitor least 2 week discontinue HAART simultaneously . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year , every 6 month 3 year annually 15 year .</detailed_description>
