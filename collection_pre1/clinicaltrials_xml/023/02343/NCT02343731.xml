	<brief_summary>Studies show family member share much composition microbiota ( trillion micro-organisms gut ) dog ( Song et . al . 2013 ) . This show introduction dog home environment profound impact human microbiota . Additionally , many study show child raise dog less likely others develop range immune-mediated disorder , include asthma allergy ( Ownby , Johnson , Peterson 2002 ; Almqvist et al . 2003 ; Havstad et al . 2011 ) . This suggest dog serve probiotic child appropriately train immune system produce inflammation response harmless stimulus . What known , however , whether true elderly population dog . Thus , study seek explore whether dog might also improve physical mental health elderly adult improve structure function microbiota . The investigator propose pilot/proof concept study investigate whether dog might improve physical mental health elderly adult via change ( improve ) structure function microbiota ( gut flora ) . The investigator propose pre-post study design among 20 elderly individual ( age 50 old ) investigate probiotic effect dog might individual . The investigator particularly interested know whether introduce dog home one live recent past increase `` positive '' microorganism gut human live . The investigator also measure change marker inflammation ( blood sample ) well change self-reported score depression , frailty , physical activity , general health well-being mobility among human participant . In order ass effect animal study participant , investigator also collect analyze fecal blood sample well conduct home visit observe canine human interaction bond conduct assessment canine well-being use questionnaires/observational technique validate purpose study . Additionally , investigator assess interaction participant dog dog home may influence individual 's relationship dog his/her thought microbiota , human canine health human-animal interaction monthly semi-structured interview . The investigator previously receive IACUC approval study , approval number 14-537 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One amaze scientific discovery last decade important role trillion micro-organism gut ( call `` microbiota '' ) play promote good physical health emotional well-being . Unfortunately , many aspect modern world conspire alter composition function gut microbiota way damage health , especially elderly strong correlation see microbiota composition frailty . Work research group others suggest one important factor damage microbiota modern world separation many micro-organisms investigator co-evolved ability lower type chronic inflammation ubiquitous modern world contribute development press health issue , diabetes heart disease depression dementia ( Huang et al. , 2013 ; Mayer et al , 2014 ; Naseribafrouei , 2013 ) . While much write positive psycho-social impact animal-human relationship human psychological health ( Allen et al , 1991 ; Allen et al . ; 2002 ; Collins et al , 2006 ; Kwong &amp; Bartholomew , 2011 ; Kurdek , 2008 ; Wells , 2007 ) , less know direct physical effect animal human health . What known , however , largely related animal ' effect stress reduction ( Allen et al , 1991 ; Allen et al. , 2002 ) anxiety ( Foster &amp; McVey Neufeld , 2013 ) , mood ( Collins et al , 2006 ) cardiovascular disease ( Allen et al. , 2002 ) What largely unexplored , however , mechanism interaction positive impact human health take place . Thus , work colleague world leader study link microbiota health , investigator propose conduct study design explore potential dog serve `` probiotic delivery system '' enhance physical health cognitive emotional functioning at-risk elderly person . The rationale novel approach enhance health well-being elderly come several line evidence . First , one recent study show family member share much composition microbiota dog ( Song et al . 2013 ) . This show introduction dog home environment profound impact human microbiota . Second , many study show child raise dog less likely others develop range immune-mediated disorder , include asthma allergy ( Ownby et al . 2002 ; Almqvist et al . 2003 ; Havstad et al . 2011 ) . This suggest dog serve probiotic child appropriately train immune system produce inflammation response harmless stimulus . Thus , know , study design explore , whether dog might also improve physical mental health elderly adult improve structure function microbiota . This proof concept / pilot study . Should result study suggest indeed positive benefit/relationship canine companionship microbiota elderly human companion , investigator plan implement large , full-scale clinical trial investigate phenomenon . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize introduction canine companion home elderly individual ( define age 50 old ) result increase protective 'positive ' gut micro-organisms increase correspond improve immune function elderly human study participant .</detailed_description>
