	<brief_title>Ultrasound Study Season-Long Joint Changes College Baseball Players</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim use ultrasound image assess health ulnar collateral ligament ( UCL ) elbow , act major stabilizer overhead throw athlete often injured baseball pitcher . The health UCL assess measured amount laxity UCL , identify distance end humerus ( arm bone ) UCL originate begin ulna ( forearm bone ) UCL end . An increase distance indicate increase laxity ligament , risk factor injury/tearing ligament repetitive throw see baseball pitcher . Measurements make rest 3 pound valgus stress 30 degree elbow flexion UCL act main stabilizer elbow . Valgus stress necessary procedure damage ligament clearly see position compare measurement rest . Measurements make right left elbow , well right left knee . The purpose include knee protocol subject blind true intention study . Due psychological harm could occur subject know focus study UCL , study present subject research team view structure within elbow knee , overall flexibility , strength , bony change monitor throughout season use ultrasound . Therefore , ultrasound measurement knee sham measurement , measurement make elbow record . In addition ultrasound , measurement range motion perform test session . Motions test : shoulder flexion , extension , abduction , internal rotation , external rotation ; elbow flexion extension ; wrist flexion extension ; hip flexion , extension , abduction , internal rotation , external rotation ; knee flexion extension . Recent study find significant result deficit range motion correlate UCL tear , data use conjunction measurement laxity UCL see ultrasound . Ultrasound image range motion test perform 10 subject four time throughout one baseball season : first game season , 20 game play , 40 game play , last game season play . During period , pitch data collect record pitcher . Data collect include number pitch throw , number type pitch thrown , number inning pitch , velocity pitch , time day pitch appearance .</detailed_description>
