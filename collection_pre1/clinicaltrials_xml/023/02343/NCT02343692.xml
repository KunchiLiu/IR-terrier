	<brief_summary>Up 13.5 % patient undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan abdomen without pancreatic symptom find incidental pancreatic cyst , frequency increase age . In post-mortem series , 25 % patient pancreatic cyst , 32 % potentially premalignant 3 % malignant . Premalignant cyst currently either observe remove surgically accord international guideline . Observation associate significant anxiety patient grow cost National Health Service , surgery usually benign condition associate insignificant morbidity mortality . Premalignant pancreatic cyst may indolent number year malignant transformation , create window opportunity minimally invasive intervention cure . New early treatment option premalignant tumour urgently require . This study evaluate safety efficacy novel minimally invasive technique treatment pancreatic cystic tumours; endoscopic ultrasound guide radiofrequency ablation ( EUSRFA ) . If successful offer alternative long term observation surgery patient condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Multicentre Trial Endoscopic Ultrasound Guided Radiofrequency Ablation Cystic Tumours Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cystic tumour emerge grow diagnostic challenge clinician . Due widespread use high quality crosssectional imaging technique , 1.2 2.6 % patient undergo CT nonpancreatic indication find incidental pancreatic cystic tumour . Pancreatic cyst encompass range pathology benign malignant . Premalignant pancreatic cyst know indolent number year transform invasive cancer , create window opportunity intervention cure . There strong correlation pancreatic cyst age . In recent series patient incidental pancreatic cystic tumour , case find patient le 40 year age , 8.7 percent patient age 80 89 year pancreatic cyst . The natural history pancreatic cystic tumour remain poorly understood , significant uncertainty exist regard appropriate diagnostic workup , differentiate benign malignant lesion choice therapy . Characterisation pancreatic cystic lesion usually make combination noninvasive cross sectional imaging necessary , endoscopic ultrasound guide fine needle aspiration ( EUSFNA ) tissue and/or cyst fluid . In undergo EUSFNA , fluid aspirate cytology obtain 80 % case sample frequently low cellularity sensitivity diagnostic cytology range 31 % 85 % . Pancreatic EUSFNA safe test , complication rate ( mainly pancreatitis , rarely infection bleed ) occur approximately 12.4 % . Our published complication rate demonstrate 0 % mortality 0.6 % morbidity ( mild acute pancreatitis ) . To guide treatment consensus document publish International Association Pancreatology 2006 updated 2012 . The guideline recommend surgical resection pancreatic cyst cause symptom large 3 cm , contain mural nodule associate dilatation main pancreatic duct . If cyst le 3cm feature guideline recommend lesion safely follow serial imaging . They recommend annual imaging lesion &lt; 10mm , 6 monthly image lesion 1020mm 3 monthly image lesion &gt; 20mm . How long patient follow referred surgical resection unclear associate grow surveillance cost NHS . Surgical resection pancreas considerable undertaking associate significant morbidity ( 21 59 % ) mortality ( 07 % ) . In addition , many elderly patient significant comorbidity fit enough undergo pancreatic surgery . To date , small study use ablative technique alternative surgical resection . EUSguided injection alcohol associate cyst ablation rate 35 62 % , short term follow . However , technique achieve total cyst ablation cyst septation associated complication rate ( pain pancreatitis ) 4 20 % . A major potential advantage EUS guide RFA ablation septated cystic tumour feasible treatment effect monitor realtime EUS control . Radiofrequency ablation : Radiofrequency ablation achieve high frequency alternate current generates high temperature cause coagulative necrosis . It use widely , percutaneously intraoperatively , treat primary secondary cancer liver , lung , kidney , bone , pancreas oesophagus . The Habib EUS RFA catheter single use sterile catheter use endoscopic ultrasound . It endoscopic monopolar catheter design ablate cystic tumour pancreas European Conformity approval purpose . Following identification puncture pancreatic cyst , EUS RFA catheter introduce standard 19G EUSFNA needle . The catheter active metallic electrode place distal part pancreatic cyst EUSguidance . The catheter use variety commercially available RF Generators , RITA 1500 , RITA 1500X , ERBE VIO200D/300D . A dose 10W 90 second administer cystic tumour . EUSguided needle placement pancreatic cyst standard technique , perform experienced ( least 5 year ) endoscopists carry regular EUS intervention ( least 150 case per year ) . Animal study pancreatic RFA : The safety efficacy monopolar Habib EUS RFA catheter use study examine porcine model . The pancreas visualized five case four case multiple puncture pancreas possible . Each animal receive 12 minute EUSguided RFA pancreas variety current ( 46W ) , catheter exposure ( 610mm ) length time ( 0.25 minute ) . Following procedure , blood test reveal evidence pancreatitis post mortem day 7 , three pig focal fat necrosis surround pancreas . Analysis size area ablation normal porcine pancreas find proportionally related catheter length , power time tissue expose .</detailed_description>
