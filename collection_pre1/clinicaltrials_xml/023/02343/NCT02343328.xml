	<brief_summary>The investigator wish compare Fecal Microbiota Transplant ( FMT ) capsule placebo capsule subject TWO episodes C. difficile . The investigator numerous subject physician request FMT time second relapse , order prevent hospitalization , obtain faster durable cure , avoid costly medication like fidaxomicin oral vancomycin , `` fix '' underlying dysbiosis . In instance , subject feel like ask `` get sick '' pursue effective option . The investigator propose study subject rigorous placebo control design , contribute significantly understanding utility FMT , timing , real relapse rate tertiary referral center . Subjects relapse placebo definition third episode , meet consensus criterion FMT , offer `` standard '' FMT capsule time . Additionally , study allow u capture safety data , comparison placebo capsule enhance understand microbiology dysbiosis , early illness course . Lastly , investigator may decide perform cost analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patients two episode Clostridium dificile infection define resolve symptom initial microbiologically confirm diagnosis C. difficile , complete course antibiotic , second positive test ( toxin PCR ) obtain relapse diarrhea symptom treat provider . Subjects positive `` test cure '' stool sample ( NOT advise SHEA guideline ) absence relapse symptom CDI , never improve symptom initial course antibiotic eligible . ( Subjects response antibiotic may additional diagnosis likely help FMT . ) Willingness accept risk unrelated donor stool . Age 18 . We believe reason upper age limit long patient consent swallow large capsule . The elderly disproportionately affect CDI term incidence , severity affect quality life give limited mobility . Able consent self . Subjects expect receive additional antibiotic indication next 8 week . Patients standard chemotherapeutic regimen solid tumor , significant duration neutropenia NOT expect 2 week follow FMT may enrol agreement oncologist . Pt must willing baseline Hepatitis B C screening , HIV screen ( required FDA past study ) . Those know seropositive illness need retested . These illness exclude subject priori , simply wish document initial serostatus . Subjects complete second course antibiotic may enrol 7 day complete second course antibiotic C. difficile Delayed gastric empty syndrome Known chronic aspiration Swallowing dysfunction oralmotor dyscoordination , inability unwillingness swallow multiple large capsule Pregnant woman ; previously continue include postpartum breastfeeding woman . Women child bear potential urine serum human chorionic gonadotropin test enrollment . Patients acute illness unrelated CDI acute exacerbation underlie comorbid condition Neutropenia ( ANC &lt; 500 ) currently expect within 2 week FMT . ( must count within 7 relevant subject , i.e . recent chemotherapy ) Subjects high dose steroid ( &gt; 40 mg daily ) Subjects multiple/combination immunosuppressive regimen include high dose corticosteroid , calcineurin inhibitor , lymphocyte deplete biologic agent , antitumor necrosis factor agent . Subjects stable dose SINGLE immunosuppressive agent like steroid , rituximab , infliximab , antiTNF agent , approval treat physician may enrol . These subject may greatest risk complication hospitalization another relapse CDI occur may benefit . Patients decompensated cirrhosis , advanced HIV/AIDS , recent bone marrow transplant , cause severe immunodeficiency . Patients history significant allergy food exclude donor diet ( exclude food tree nut , peanut , shellfish , egg ) Ongoing systemic antibiotic infection ( people well maintain suppressive vancomycin transplant later ) . Subjects may recently complete course antibiotic another indication . Advanced HIV/AIDS cluster differentiation 4 cell ( CD4 ) count less 50 . Allergy chocolate/cocoa gelatin , unwillingness ingest gelatin ( placebo capsule ) .</criteria>
