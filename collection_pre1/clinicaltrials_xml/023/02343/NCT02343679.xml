	<detailed_description>This phase II , single arm , unblinded study ceritinib patient rel/ref hematologic malignancy . Up 24 evaluable subject enrol interim analysis efficacy first 9 subject enrol . Any subject take least dose study drug evaluable safety . Only subject complete least 1 cycle study drug clear progression physical exam least one restaging study consider evaluable response . Each subject receive dose 750mg po daily study entry . Subjects stable disease well allow continue study drug disease progression intolerable adverse event patient physician decision . Intrapatient dose reduction allow adverse event . Blood tissue sample , collect used exploratory analysis . Dose Level 0 ( start dose ) 750mg/day Dose level -1 600mg/day Dose level -2 450mg/day Baseline evaluation conduct within 30 day prior start protocol therapy unless otherwise noted time event table . Scans x-rays must perform within six week prior start therapy . Bone marrow biopsy must perform within twelve week prior start therapy . In event patient 's condition deteriorating , laboratory evaluation repeat within 48 hour prior initiation next cycle therapy . All lab within study eligibility range prior start study treatment . All visit occur within 3 day schedule day visit . An early late visit shorten extend duration cycle - cycle 28 day . If study drug hold reason missed day still count day cycle . However , study drug hold 28 day cycle end , day 1 next cycle necessary evaluation start drug restart . Therefore , cycle drug hold could potentially 28 day . Patients follow 2 year completion therapy progression disease death , whichever come first . In follow , patient see every 3 month physical exam , lab draw first two year complete study drug alternative therapy begin progression disease death-whichever come first . Radiographic image perform every 6 month first two year study drug complete . Patients remove study unacceptable adverse event follow resolution stabilization adverse event continue follow progression disease death . Unacceptable adverse event lead stop study drug resolution drug relate toxicity 6 week washout period subject remove study define section 6 . Patients remove study due progressive disease follow resolution stabilization adverse event due agent , follow complete . At minimum , patient discontinue ceritinib treatment , include refuse return final visit , contact safety evaluation 30 day follow last dose treatment</detailed_description>
