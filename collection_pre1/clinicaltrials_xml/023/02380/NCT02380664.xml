	<brief_summary>Swimming training associate decrease bone mass low bone mass acquisition growth period , mainly compare weight-bearing sport . Little information available adolescent point direction still controversial . On hand , bone strength depend bone mass bone structure microarchitecture . The cross sectional area , cortex thickness trabecular density important aspect bone health . There study effect swim bone architecture adolescent . This information relevant present future health adolescent practice swim organization promote sport . Jumping whole body vibration training program seem elicit important osteogenic effect ; however , little information regard adolescent population , even less adolescent potentially decrease bone acquisition swimmer . The main aim research project therefore , analyze effect swim train bone mass , metabolism , structure architecture adolescent analyze possible relationship among . Secondly , test whether include short boot jump whole body vibration may able palliate possible deleterious effect swim facilitate normal even healthy bone development . And finally study durability training-related bone gain time .</brief_summary>
