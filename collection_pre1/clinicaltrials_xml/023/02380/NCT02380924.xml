	<detailed_description>EryDex System ( EDS ) combination product use administer dexamethasone sodium phosphate ( DSP ) ex vivo encapsulation autologous erythrocytes re-infused . DSP dephosphorylated RBCs release dexamethasone . The 12 subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion assign one 2 group , consist 6 subject , follow : - Group 1 ( active drug arm ) : 15-20 mg DSP load RBC use EDS . - Group 2 ( sham arm ) : sham treat autologous RBC use EDS One 50±5mL aliquot blood collect subject treat use EDS process ( either active drug sham ) resultant process RBCs radiolabeled Chromium-51 ( 51Cr ) vivo kinetic study . A second 10±5mL simultaneously collect sample label Technetium-99m ( 99mTc ) estimate subject 's blood volume . These labeled aliquot mixed , simultaneously infused peripheral vein via butterfly similar catheter ( total dose 20-40 μCi ) . Blood sample collect subject 's contralateral arm immediately pre-infusion 5 , 7.5 , 10 , 12.5 , 15 , 20 , 30 minute ( ± 3 min ) , Day 1 , 24 hour ( ±2 h ) completion infusion . Vital sign assess 30-min sample Day 0 Day 1 24-h sample collect . Additional blood sample collect 48 ( ±4 h ) 72 ( ±4 h ) hour 7 ( ±1 ) day post-infusion , weekly 49 day post-infusion , window ±2 day visit .</detailed_description>
