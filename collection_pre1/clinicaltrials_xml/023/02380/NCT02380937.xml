	<brief_summary>The Radio Frequency Ablation Atrial Flutter Magnetic Resonance Guidance Tracking Pilot Study ( hereafter refer `` pilot study '' ) prospective , non- randomize , single-center , pilot study . The purpose clinical study evaluate safety performance Imricor Medical Systems , Inc. ( Imricor ) Vision Ablation Catheter use related accessory treatment type I atrial flutter . The Vision Ablation Catheter accessory design use fluoroscopic magnetic resonance guidance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radio Frequency Ablation Atrial Flutter With Magnetic Resonance Guidance Tracking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An objective study perform entire ablation procedure subject preparation confirmation bidirectional conduction block entirely magnetic resonance guidance . However , investigator 's discretion , preparation subject may occur conventional electrophysiology laboratory follow transfer patient magnetic resonance suite ablation procedure . Additionally , bidirectional conduction block achieve within 90 minute initial catheter placement , subject may transfer magnetic resonance suite conventional electrophysiology lab complete procedure . Clinical success bidirectional conduction block regardless environment within ablation occurs . The study conduct single center , Herzzentrum Leipzig University Hospital , Germany , maximum 30 subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion participate study . This study require use investigational product two independent manufacturer : Imricor Philips . Imricor develop ablation catheter relate accessory , introducers , record system . Philips develop image guidance map system compatible Imricor product . The Vision Ablation Catheter use conjunction follow investigational product : Vision Ablation Catheter Cable Set ( accessory sterile cable ) , Vision Hemostasis Introducer , Vision Dual-Deflect Sheath , Horizon record system , interventional MRI Suite ( iSuite ) image guidance mapping system . With exception iSuite , manufacture Philips , Imricor provide investigational device use study . Each procedure utilize follow two single-use product : two Vision Ablation Catheters accessory Catheter Cable set . At discretion investigator , Vision Hemostasis Introducers may use femoral access Vision Dual- Deflect Sheath may use conjunction Vision Ablation Catheter Cable Set . Ablation treatment arrhythmia inherently complex procedure . Use investigational product list magnetic resonance guidance new approach perform interventional electrophysiology procedure . The study population consist adult patient require ablation type I atrial flutter . Study subject require follow-up visit telephone call 7 day post procedure . Accordingly , expect total study duration approximately six month study start plan October 2014 .</detailed_description>
