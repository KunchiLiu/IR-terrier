	<detailed_description>Project titel : Oral potassium supplementation healthy men - interaction renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system sympathetic nervous system Protocol number : KARAASS-1 EudraCT number : 2013-004460-66 Objective The objective study investigate oral potassium supplementation , administrated form drug Kaleorid® regulate human blood pressure . More specific objective test oral potassium supplementation interacts : - The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system - The sympathetic nervous system To plan conduct randomized clinical placebo-controlled double-blinded crossover trial test drug Kaleorid® affect component renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system sympathetic nervous system compare placebo healthy men . Background The global burden hypertension huge . The estimated number adult hypertension year 2000 972 million number expect increase 60 % total number 1.56 billion 2025 worldwide ( 1 ) . In Denmark , estimate prevalence hypertension among adult population lie 26 % 40 % ( 2 ) . Hypertension thus wide spread disease know , hypertension one important modifiable risk factor cardiovascular , cerebrovascular renal disease ( 3 ; 4 ) . In study investigate role potassium regulation human blood pressure . It accept knowledge , potassium rich diet lower blood pressure demonstrate well construct DASH ( Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension ) study ( 5 ) . In addition high potassium level DASH diet also contain high level magnesium , calcium low-fat dairy product low level saturate fat , whether blood pressure lower effect DASH diet merely result high potassium level result combine diet difficult tell . Nonetheless meta-analysis demonstrate significant systolic diastolic blood pressure lower effect administration high-dose oral potassium supplementation compare placebo administration low-dose oral potassium supplementation ( 6 ) . The risk stroke , main adverse outcome long time hypertension , also demonstrate reduced high dietary potassium intake ( 7 ) . And one study demonstrate , need antihypertensive medication hypertensive subject reduce increase dietary potassium intake natural food ( 8 ) . A high dietary potassium intake thus seem beneficial . Furthermore potassium depletion seem opposite effect potassium supplementation . Both normotensive men patient essential hypertension blood pressure increase potassium depletion ( 9 ; 10 ) . Taken together , reliable evidence inverse correlation potassium intake level blood pressure . Nevertheless mechanism behind apparent inverse correlation still conundrum . Different hypothesis develop , mostly basis animal study . In rat kidney , potassium depletion expect elicit retention sodium thereby hypertension . At level arterial wall potassium depletion expect low intracellular potassium level smooth muscle cell , would lead depolarization membrane thereby elicit contraction , increase peripheral vascular resistance hypertension . On hand high potassium diet expect elicit endothelium-dependent vasodilatation . Another postulate mechanism high potassium level cerebrospinal fluid would decrease sympathetic outflow brain thereby blood pressure . The mentioned theory ( 11 ) mainly base animal study . It known high potassium intake human result increase aldosterone level blood ( 12 ) . The increased aldosterone level secures body hyperkalemia potassium loading . In theory rise aldosterone also elicit inappropriate sodium volume retention thereby hypertension . But . The blood pressure remain unchanged ( 12 ) decrease rise potassium intake . So question - Why potassium stimulate aldosterone secretion result hypertension ? In laboratory Molecular Biology Department Nephrology P , Rigshospitalet , find interesting result regard potassium aldosterone . Working vitro model aldosterone secretion form human adrenocortical cell line H295R , proven model study function human adrenal cortex ( 13 ; 14 ) , find interaction extracellular potassium component renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) . The H295R cell line model human adrenocortical zona glomerulosa cell , normally site synthesis secretion aldosterone human body . Aldosterone secretion cell mainly stimulate angiotensin II ( Ang II ) , part activation RAAS , extracellular potassium situation rise level extracellular potassium . These two secretagogues traditionally look upon independent . But study show interaction two system . It find stimulation H295R cell high level extracellular potassium decrease amount Ang II type 1 receptor membrane cell , measure fall specific bind radioactive label Ang II cell ( 15 ) . This reduction specific bind radioactive label Ang II , follow potassium induce reduction expression Ang II type 1 receptor gene ( AGTR1 ) ( 15 ) . This mean Ang II sensitivity human aldosterone produce cell reduce high level extracellular potassium vitro hypothesis high level extracellular potassium thus modulate renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system . Inspired result laboratory , objective present study verify existence inhibitory interaction high potassium level RAAS vivo . The overall purpose clarify role potassium regulation human blood pressure . Hypotheses In trial 4 week treatment drug Kaleorid® , 750mg , 3 tablet 3 time daily , equivalent 90 mmol potassium daily , test 4 week treatment placebo , 3 tablet 3 time daily crossover design . In end treatment period test do investigate component renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system sympathetic nervous system . Primary hypothesis primary endpoint : The primary hypothesis treatment Kaleorid® reduce Ang II sensitivity human adrenal cortex thereby reduce Ang II stimulate aldosterone secretion . This hypothesis test intravenous Ang II infusion measurement follow aldosterone response blood sample . The test do twice study participant , treatment Kaleorid® treatment placebo . Primary endpoint : Ang II stimulate S-aldosterone Secondary hypothesis : The secondary hypothesis treatment Kaleorid® also reduce Ang II sensitivity smooth muscle cell human vascular resistance vessel regulation Ang II receptor membrane smooth muscle cell . This would elicit vasodilatation fall blood pressure To test measure blood pressure evaluate vascular tonus , mention intravenous Ang II infusion . Blood pressure , intravenous Ang II infusion measure Finger Plethysmography conventional brachial blood pressure measurement . Vascular tonus , intravenous Ang II infusion evaluate use Impedance Cardiography , Finger Plethysmography Doppler Ultrasound measurement blood flow . Impedance Cardiography Finger Plethysmography use estimate total peripheral resistance ( TPR ) . Doppler Ultrasound use measure blood flow calculate resistance index ( RI ) renal artery , celiac artery superior mesenteric artery . Finally take fat biopsy gluteal region study participant treatment period . In biopsy expect find vascular resistance vessel , investigate receptorfunction receptorexpression . Different receptor investigate , among Ang II type 1 receptor . Tertiary hypothesis : The tertiary hypothesis treatment Kaleorid® interact activity sympathetic nervous system . To test potential interaction plan measure P-epinephrine P-norepinephrine blood measure content epinephrine norepinephrine urine sample end treatment period . We plan measure P-epinephrine P-norepinephrine blood , mention intravenous Ang II infusion . Methods Design : This randomized clinical placebo-controlled double-blinded crossover trial design test drug Kaleorid® affect component renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system sympathetic nervous system compare placebo healthy men . After inclusion baseline screen group healthy men normal office blood pressure randomize either 4 week treatment drug Kaleorid® , 750mg , 3 tablet 3 time daily 4 week treatment placebo tablet , 3 tablet 3 time daily . On day 26 first treatment period study participant meet hospital receive equipment measure 24-hours ambulatory blood pressure collect 48-hours urine sample . On day blood sample , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) fat biopsy gluteal region do . On day 28 first treatment period study participant meet hospital . This day test intravenous Ang II infusion follow continuous measurement blood pressure aldosterone response ( use blood sample ) . Before , intravenous Ang II infusion blood pressure measure Finger Plethysmography conventional brachial blood pressure measurement . Vascular tonus , intravenous Ang II infusion evaluate use Impedance Cardiography , Finger Plethysmography Doppler Ultrasound measurement blood flow . After first period treatment test washout period two week insert . After two week washout , study participant crossover start treatment ( second treatment period ) . The former Kaleorid® treat individual become placebo treated individual , former placebo treat individual become Kaleorid® treated individual . After another 4 week treatment , test do first period treatment repeat . Investigational drug , Randomization , Blinding Statistics : The drug Kaleorid® placebo tablet constitute investigational drug clinical trial human . The drug Kaleorid® purchase deliver regional pharmacy Capital Region Denmark . The placebo tablet manufacture delivered regional pharmacy Capital Region Denmark . The pharmacy responsible randomization treatment , pack investigational drug label investigational drug . The delivered tablet container label content , treatment plan blind study participant investigator - intentional double-blinded . Since design study cross-over design , statistic pair data plan used evaluation result . A power calculation primary endpoint do accord standard criterion 25 study participant sufficient . Experimental procedure : Day 7 On day 7 treatment period study participant blood sample do measure potassium , sodium , creatinine eGFR . This merely safety blood sample test study participant tolerate investigational drug develop hyperkalemia . Day 26 On day 26 treatment period study participant meet hospital receive equipment measure 24-hours ambulatory blood pressure collect 48-hours urine sample . On day blood sample , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) fat biopsy gluteal region do . The fat biopsy perform surgical skilled physician . After removal biopsy immediately transfer ice-cold physiological buffer transport laboratory Glostrup Research Institute . At laboratory small arteriole biopsy dissect free fat connective tissue use microscope . The dissected arteriole section 1-2 mm length cylindrical segment either immediately use vasomotor response study store -80°C molecular study . For vasomotor response study , isolated arteriole segment mount Mulvany-Halpern wire-myograph , whereby possible test physiological response vessel add different hormone e.g . Ang II . The molecular study consist quantitative real-time PCR quantify mRNA expression relevant receptor gene , western blot analyse receptor protein expression immunohistochemistry analyse receptor localization . Day 28 On day 28 treatment period study participant meet hospital . After hand back equipment use 24-hours ambulatory blood pressure urine sample study participant test intravenous Ang II infusion . The Ang II infusion do study participant supine position . The Ang II infusion give intravenously dosage 5 ng/kg/min 30 min . The chosen dosage length duration base study safe ( 16-18 ) . Before , Ang II infusion blood sample take another intravenous access analyse blood S-aldosterone , P-angiotensin II , Plasma renin activity , P-epinephrine , P-norepinephrine N-PRO-ANP . Before , infusion study participant monitor closely . Blood pressure measure conventional brachial blood pressure measurement also Finger Plethysmography , give continuous blood pressure assessment .
