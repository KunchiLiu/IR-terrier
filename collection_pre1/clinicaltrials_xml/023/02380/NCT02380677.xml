For first 2 cohort 1+5 study design utilize . A single patient enrol sequentially cohort 1 cohort 2 . If either patient cohort 1 2 experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) Cycle 1 , cohort expand enroll additional patient total 6 . As cohort 3 subsequent cohort , 3+3 dose escalation schema utilized . MTD/RP2D determine dose level &lt; 2 6 patient experience DLT cohort . The Phase 2a part study open-label expansion cohort study . An additional 24 patient advanced , histologically confirm solid tumor malignancy enrol . All patient assign treatment MTD/RP2D CRLX301 single agent . All patient follow safety , tumor response , progression free survival ( PFS ) per RECIST version 1.1 guideline . Patients remain study treatment experience progression disease , unacceptable toxicity , specify reason discontinuation .</detailed_description>
