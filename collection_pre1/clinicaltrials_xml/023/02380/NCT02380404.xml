	<brief_summary>1 . Hypothesis/Specific aim The aim present study proposal validate implant treatment concept edentulous upper maxilla use four implants-supported locator abutment retain removable prosthesis . Specific aim : - The primary objective study evaluate implant prosthodontics success rate propose implant treatment approach follow-up period 1 , 3 5 year well biological prosthodontics complication . - The secondary objective ass evolution patient center outcomes suggest treatment maxilla . Oral health-related quality life ( OHRQoL ) patient ' satisfaction relating prosthesis consider . - The third objective compare implant , prosthodontics patient-centered outcome accord implant distribution ; 4 anterior maxillary sinus ( ANT ) versus 2 anterior implant 2 implant maxillary tuberosity ( POST ) . Hypothesis : - Implant survival rate use treatment concept similar restoration implant-supported fixed prosthesis , base publish data . No difference implant survival rate find ANT POST implant distribution . - Prosthodontics survival rate use follow treatment concept similar one find bar , base publish data . The ANT implant distribution cause few prosthodontics complication compare POST implant distribution . - There significant improvement OHRQoL patient satisfaction compare baseline OHRQoL observe conventional removable denture . The level improvement OHRQoL patient satisfaction similar ANT POST implant distribution .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.1 Background significance The effectiveness mandibular overdentures retain 2 dental implant impact Oral Health-Related Quality Life ( OHRQoL ) patient satisfaction extensively document last decade ( 1-6 ) . According recent systematic review , implant survival rate oral rehabilitation concept reach 95 % ( 7-10 ) . The scientific validation efficacy rehabilitation concept influence social security system several country like Belgium . Therefore , treatment approach nowadays consider evidence-based cost-effective treatment option improve function quality life mandibular edentulous patient . Unfortunately , cost-effective treatment concept restore edentulous maxilla widely document ( 11 ) . Many study display high success rate fix implant-supported rehabilitation edentulous maxilla ( 12 ) treatment option remain costly therefore reserve limited social category patient . This work important need provide affordable efficient implant treatment approach restore function improve satisfaction OHRQoL patient edentulous maxilla . 1.2 Preliminary study connection new projects/continuing project Even though author describe implant survival rate implant-retained overdentures upper maxilla ( 8 , 13-16 ) , treatment approach involve bar . The placement 4 implant individual attachment cost-effective treatment modality poorly document literature term implant prosthodontics outcome also aspects assess implant distribution , attachment type improvement patient center outcome . Therefore , study need validate placement 4 implant individual attachment reliable treatment modality . 1.3 Research design methods The study design single center prospective cohort study . The study protocol submit Ethics Committee University Hospital University Li√®ge , Belgium . A total 30 patient edentulous maxilla least one short span dentition ( fix ) low jaw include study . The inclusion exclusion criterion list : Inclusion criterion - Physical status accord American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) = 1 , 2 - Wearing complete upper denture adequate good condition - Signed informed consent form describe purpose process study Exclusion criterion - Uncontrolled periodontitis/peri-implantitis ( low jaw ) - Lack bone placement 4 implant 3.3 diameter 8 mm bone regeneration . - Tobacco use &gt; 10cigarettes/day Pre-treatment examination Clinical evaluation upper removable denture low dentition do . Oral hygiene instruction give . The patient fulfil inclusion criterion ask complete 3 questionnaire patient satisfaction OHRQoL socio-demographic condition explain possibility enrol study order minimize risk bias . The McGill Denture Satisfaction Instrument ( 17 ) use evaluate patient ' satisfaction relating prosthesis . This questionnaire treatment-specific patient-based outcome assess satisfaction relate 6 aspect mandibular prosthesis : general satisfaction , comfort , stability , aesthetic , chew ability ( ease chew ) , chew efficiency ( ability crush food small particle ) , ease cleaning , ability speak oral condition ( condition mouth , refer oral health status measure `` In general , satisfied oral condition ? '' . The subject answer 100 mm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) anchor word `` satisfy '' `` extremely satisfied '' . The Oral Health Impact Profile ( OHIP-20 ) questionnaire use assess oral health-related quality life . This 20-item questionnaire measure self-reported impairment edentulous population within seven domain : functional limitation , physical pain , psychological discomfort , physical disability , psychological disability , social disability handicap . The item rat six-point Likert scale ( `` never '' = 1 , `` rarely '' = 2 , `` occasionally '' = 3 , `` often '' = 4 , `` often '' = 5 `` time '' = 6 ) . OHIP-20s total range therefore 20-120 point , low score indicate well oral health-related quality life ( 4 , 18 , 19 ) . Data gender , age , level education , annual household revenue , marital status lifestyle ( live alone others ) obtain standard socio-demographic questionnaire . Cone beam CT assessment After informed consent sign , CT scan do evaluate 2 independent surgeon potentially exclude patient lack bone availability . In case disagreement , case discuss . Surgical procedure Once patient enrol study , surgery schedule within week . Antibiotics prescribe 1 day surgery continue 5 day . Three calibrate confirm surgeon place 4 Narrow Neck ( NN ) Regular Neck ( RN ) Roxolid tissue level implant ( Institut Straumann , Basel Switzerland ) accord surgical protocol recommend manufacturer . The implant position determine previously time CT scan evaluation agreement 2 operator accord bone availability . Two implant place lateral canine region 2 implant distal possible . The implant place parallel possible . A maximum divergence 10 tolerate . The flap design determine accord available bone quantity order emphasize adequate quantity keratinize tissue around implant . A Cone Beam Computed Tomography ( CBCT ) scan do directly surgery . Sutures perform silk suture remove 1 week . The removable ( conventional ) prosthesis adapt avoid contact implant . Patients follow 4 8 week post-surgery , respectively . At 8 week , panoramic x-ray do . If osseointegration successful , removable prosthesis connect implant . Prosthodontics procedure At 8 week , prosthesis connect implant Locator . The type Locator attachment choose accord implant angulation soft tissue thickness . They torqued 35 N/cm osseointegrated implant . Afterwards , female connection fix removable prosthesis acrylic resin . The effectiveness retention check patient taught put denture . The occlusion control adjusted manipulation necessary . Follow-up visit Patient follow 1 week Locator connection 3 , 6 12 month , respectively . Thereafter , patient recall annually . In case complication , patient ask directly contact one dentists responsible study . Data collection Data collect remote secure database . Automatic data check procedure implement data entry warrant quality information store . Access database limit study investigator data keep confidential . Statistical analysis Results summarize mean standard deviation ( SD ) quantitative variable frequency table categorical finding time point . Longitudinal data display graphically analyze general linear mixed model account repeat value within patient . Success rate estimate associated 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) . The significance level set 5 % ( P &lt; 0.05 ) . Data analyze Statistical Analyses Software ( SAS S-PLUS software ) .</detailed_description>
