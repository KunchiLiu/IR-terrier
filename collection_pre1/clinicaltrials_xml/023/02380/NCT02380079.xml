	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety clinical effect SCD-101 give adult sickle cell disease . SCD-101 inhibits sickling red blood cell contain Hb S ( sickle hemoglobin ) low oxygen condition , underlie cause sickle cell disease . SCD-101 may inhibit red blood cell sickling patient sickle cell disease reduce symptom slow disease progression . This study evaluate safety antisickling activity SCD-101 24 adult sickle cell disease .</brief_summary>
