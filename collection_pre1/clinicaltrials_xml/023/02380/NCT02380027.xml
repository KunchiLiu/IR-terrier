	<brief_summary>This evaluate detection rate prostate cancer MRI-targeted prostate biopsy compare standard 12-core trans-rectal ultrasound guide ( TRUS ) prostate biopsy . Each participant randomly allocate one biopsy test . We hypothesise MRI-targeted biopsy detect few clinically significant cancer TRUS biopsy detect few clinically insignificant prostate cancer TRUS biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The classical pathway diagnosis prostate cancer trans-rectal ultrasound guide ( TRUS ) biopsy prostate follow raise PSA . This currently mainstay prostate cancer diagnosis majority centre . It many advantage perform routinely local anaesthetic outpatient setting . However limitation , include over-diagnosis insignificant cancer under-diagnosis significant cancer . An alternative pathway diagnosis prostate cancer men raise prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) perform multi-parametric MRI localize cancer use information influence conduct subsequent biopsy , know MRI-targeted biopsy . MRI-targeted biopsy show preliminary study detect similar amount clinically significant cancer TRUS-biopsy may several advantage , example reduce number men require biopsy . This randomize controlled trial aim assess detection rate clinically significant clinically insignificant cancer MRI-targeted biopsy compare standard 12-core TRUS biopsy men refer clinical suspicion prostate cancer prior prostate biopsy . A 'clinically insignificant cancer ' cancer unlikely progress affect man 's life expectancy therefore warrant treatment . However diagnosed insignificant cancer large proportion patient request treatment case significant cancer present . A prostate cancer detection pathway find significant cancer avoid diagnosis insignificant cancer major unmet need . The potential implication trial include : - A redefine prostate cancer diagnostic pathway - A reduction number patient undergoing prostate biopsy - A reduction number biopsy core take per patient - A reduction biopsy-related sepsis , pain side effect - A reduction over-diagnosis clinically insignificant prostate cancer - A reduction economic burden diagnose treat prostate cancer</detailed_description>
