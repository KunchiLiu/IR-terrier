	<brief_title>Heterologous Effects BCG Healthy UK Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 1927 , observe BCG-vaccinated neonate low all-cause mortality rate . This heterologous non-specific effect within first 6-12 month life demonstrate randomised observational study low income country high childhood mortality rate . The consistent effect reduce neonatal mortality due few case neonatal sepsis , respiratory infection fever . The main limitation study risk confound inherent cross sectional observational design . It essential determine cogency effect , potential BCG replacement vaccine must non-inferior BCG regard . There plausible rationale BCG , replicate mycobacterium , capable induce non-specific innate immunity , could induce protection disease death non-mycobacterial infection early life . For example , intravesical BCG effective treatment bladder cancer , effect presume non-specific innate . However , understand immunological mechanism involve incomplete . Data need robust experiment quantify causal relationship infant survival BCG vaccination . Demonstrating effect recent BCG vaccination growth common bacterial pathogen involve neonatal sepsis , use whole blood in-vitro human model , would provide evidence support randomise control trial infant TB high burden country would impact public health vaccination schedule . In addition would provide u in-vitro model assess future BCG replacement vaccine . Healthy BCG naïve adult UK select study low baseline level anti-mycobacterial immunity therefore reduce ability suppress BCG growth . Whilst target population heterologous effect BCG vaccination infant , blood volume require order optimise GIA would possible collect infant . Therefore undertaking work healthy BCG naïve UK adult obtain blood volume require exploratory work population individual similar background mycobacterial exposure infant TB high burden , low income country . Volunteers study receive BCG vaccination standard dose 2-8x10^5 cfu . BCG SSI contain Mycobacterium bovis strain Danish 1331 prefer license UK vaccination . However BCG SSI frequently go short supply globally impact UK supply . In event occurring , BCG vaccine supply Sii ( Serum institute India ) use instead contain Mycobacterium bovis BCG strain Moscow 361 I WHO list prequalified vaccine . The strain used volunteer .</detailed_description>
