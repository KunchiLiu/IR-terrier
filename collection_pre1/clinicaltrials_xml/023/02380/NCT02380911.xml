In Argentina , prevalence hypercholesterolemia increase 2005 2013 27.9 % 29.8 % , whereas rate non-optimal LDL-C , 28.0 % . The rate high cholesterol awareness 37.3 % proportion pharmacological treatment dismally low : 11.1 % . Furthermore , one four subject self-reported diagnosis coronary heart disease ( CHD ) take statin . individual CHD statins sub-optimal LDL-C level . Although antihypertensive , antidiabetic low-dose aspirin available free-of-charge primary care clinic public sector , statin include recently . As 2014 , statin ( simvastatin 20mg ) incorporate package drug provide free-of-charge patient high cholesterol , accord CVD risk stratification . The goal study test whether multifaceted educational intervention target physician pharmacist assistant , improve detection , treatment control hypercholesterolemia among uninsured patient moderate high cardiovascular risk Argentina .
