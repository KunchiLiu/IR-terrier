	<brief_summary>The MENDEL-study investigate whether use gene panel whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) : 1. improve rate diagnosis compare performance two diagnostic approach ( gene panel vs. WGS ) , 2. investigate whether use say sequencing approach early diagnostic process result reduce health care spending , 3. result improve quality life patient parent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients recruit in- outpatient clinic Otto Heubner Center , Berlin Center Rare Diseases , Institute Medical Genetics Human Genetics Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin , Germany . Following informed consent , 5 ml EDTA blood obtain index case 10 ml blood parent . Disease relate phenotype information outcome previous diagnostic test procedure record part Study visit # 1 . [ 1 ] Study visit # 1 1 . A medical genetics physical perform . Detailed clinical symptom ( phenotype ) record use Human Phenotype Ontology ( HPO ) terminology . 2 . A detailed pedigree drawn . 3 . Age disease onset determine . 4 . Results previous diagnostic test procedure , well hospital stay , record . 5 . The parent ask complete validate , standardize quality life questionnaire adapt rare disease . The questionnaire available online paper form . [ 2 ] Study visit # 2a ( optional ) This study visit take place event gene panel sequence identifies variant uncertain significance , additional information would need order determine pathogenicity ( e.g . confirmational biochemical testing , collection additional information ) . Relevant research finding discuss nature necessity additional testing explain . [ 3 ] Study visit # 2b ( optional ) This study visit take place event WGS identify variant uncertain significance additional information need order determine pathogenicity &gt; see Study visit # 2a . [ 4 ] Study visit # 3 ( result session ) Results return context genetic counseling session . [ 5 ] Study visit # 4 ( 6 month Study visit # 3 ) The parent ask complete validate , standardize quality life questionnaire adapt rare disease .</detailed_description>
