	<brief_summary>This openly randomize control parallel group study evaluate effectiveness use guided approach free-hand approach perform upper extremity regional block . Potential subject study patient schedule upper extremity surgery require supraclavicular interscalene brachial plexus block Montefiore Medical Center . Rotating resident participate study randomly assign either perform block guide approach ( help needle guidance ) free-hand without needle guidance . All block single injection block utilize in-plane technique needle insertion usual protocol institution . Each resident perform one interscalene block device one without device one supraclavicular block device one without device . An independent observer present case responsible recording time take perform block , number time needle redirect number time needle reinserted . This observer also administer satisfaction questionnaire . Number time needle redirect number time reinserted also self report assessment physician perform block . Efficacy block assess standard care practice center .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives 1 . The primary end point study evaluate time take complete block without use needle guidance device . ( Start time consider first skin touch needle completion block . Completion block define withdraw needle completely body ) . The principal investigator/co-investigator independent observer record time take complete block . 2 . Ease technique- ( Will assess short questionnaire survey end procedure ) . Immediately block finish , perform physician request fill questionnaire . 3 . Number time needle need re-directed . This self report measurement . The person perform block , investigator ( attend physician ) independent observer record number time needle manipulate . 4 . Number time needle pull entirely body reinserted . This also self report measurement . 5 . Efficacy block perform assessed ( This part routine standard care assess block . ) 6 . Total amount time take complete whole procedure ( Starting first time ultrasound probe place patient withdrawal needle complete procedure )</detailed_description>
