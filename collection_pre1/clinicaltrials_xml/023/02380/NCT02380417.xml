	<detailed_description>Following approval University Minnesota Institutional Review Board , 33 consecutive adult patient ( â‰¥ 18 year age ) observe October 2013 December 2014 underwent either single bilateral lung transplantation receive continuous paravertebral block . The paravertebral catheter place within 1-2 day postoperatively intensive care unit . If patient hemodynamically unstable critically ill place lateral decubitus position , placement catheter delay case perform ( patient include study ) They place via plane transverse technique . The ultrasound place patient 's back T8-9 level probe transverse orientation . Then 17-gauge tuohy needle advance lateral medial plane beneath transverse process upon test dose 3-5 mL 1.5 % lidocaine 1:200,000 epinephrine inject see adequate spread . The catheter feed 1 centimeter past tip tuohy needle needle withdrawn . All catheter confirm correct position real time local anesthetic injection secure skin glue occlusive dressing . Each perform patient left lateral decubitus position right catheter right lateral decubitus position leave catheter . The paravertebral catheter remain place seven day postoperatively unilateral lung transplant ten day postoperatively bilateral lung transplant . During time infusion 0.2 % ropivacaine infuse rate 0.2-0.25 ml/kg/hour elastomeric pump ( ON Q Halyard Health ) . The outcome measure minimal maximum pain score first 7 day post paravertebral catheter placement ( rat 11-point numeric rating scale ; 0=no pain , 10=worst pain imaginable ) . The acute pain Nurse Practitioners , bedside nurse , acute pain anesthesiology resident collect pain score . Additional outcomes interest include postsurgical opioid use postsurgical day 7 , length hospital stay . Patients ask daily experience nausea/vomiting , however , Nursing note physician progress note also evaluate patient experienced adverse event nausea vomit . Demographics age weight record addition length surgery time spend hospital discharge .</detailed_description>
