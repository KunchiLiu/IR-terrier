	<brief_summary>Subjects diagnose Idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease , age 40-85 inclusive , refer gait training . Since subtle difference brain organization left- right-handed people may influence measurement , right hand participant prefer . However , leave hand participant may consider . Participants randomly assign one two group undergo two week twice-daily session . Group A receiving goggles fit lens distort vision Group B patient receive sham goggles</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Visual Adaptation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participant train undergo two daily session visual adaptation home 14 consecutive day . For adaptation session , subject sit chair within reach distance wall cabinet upon two dime-sized target place ( one , approximately ten inch apart ) . While wear goggles , point rapidly one target next , bring hand back his/her torso point movement . They instruct perform movement `` quickly possible '' total 50 point movement treatment session . After perform 50 point movement , remove goggles . Throughout treatment period ask keep diary log time duration prism adaptation session . At first second site visit , participant assess posture , gait activity daily live include questionnaire . Questionnaires sent via mail post-treatment one week,1 month 3 month .</detailed_description>

However , recruit lefthanded participant insufficient righthanded volunteer . Subjects know psychiatric comorbidity investigator 's opinion would compromise participation study ; subject neurologic diagnosis , Parkinson 's disease cause imbalance gait impairment ( e.g. , multiple sclerosis , stroke , subdural hematoma , peripheral neuropathy ) Injury impairment right arm ( due Parkinson 's disease ) would affect point movement ; subject normal score UPDRS part III Classified legally blind lack sufficient visual acuity view target point hand prism adaptation Lacking sufficient understand verbal write information English complete consent screening form .</criteria>
