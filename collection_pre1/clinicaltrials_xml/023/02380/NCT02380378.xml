	<brief_title>Registry Philadelphia-Negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Philadelphia-negative ( Ph-negative ) Myeloproliferative Neoplasms ( MPN ) include polycythemia vera ( PV ) , essential thrombocythemia ( TE ) , primary myelofibrosis ( MF ) . Ph-negative MPN chronic myeloid neoplasms appear malignant transformation hematopoietic stem cell . There many clinical manifestation disease , include polyglobulia , thrombocytosis , leukocytosis , cytopenia , extramedullary hematopoiesis ( e.g . : splenomegaly ) , increase thrombotic risk risk transformation acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . Life expectancy vary 5-6 year patient MF 15 year patient PV ET . There therapeutic option patient Ph-negative MPN . In general , treatment disease symptomatic targeted relief symptom control hematological set use oral chemotherapy agent hydroxyurea . Patients MF receive palliative treatment , target relief splenomegaly cytopenia . Currently , approve drug treatment MF . In Latin America , epidemiological study great number Ph-negative MPN patient describe natural history disease , patient progress , clinical characteristic , standard care disease burden . The development up-to-date data registry Brazilian patient Ph-negative MPN allow comprehension epidemiology disease , determination survival , thrombosis incidence , transformation AML , use disease treatment-related resource , well impact different therapeutic strategy parameter . Therefore , objective study establish registry patient Ph-negative MPN order document disease diagnosis current standard care , clinical endpoint , use treatment-related resource , accord risk classification MPN . Data retrospectively prospectively collect electronic form available Internet safe website . Each center participate study principal investigator charge accuracy quality data collect . Each principal investigator staff receive login password access database enroll patient registry . An employee site charge collect data insert electronic registry . Patients shall contact order sign inform consent form . Patient data update every six month . There limit number patient enrol registry , either retrospectively prospectively . The duration study five year . Data collection continue sit decide interrupt enrollment new patient .</detailed_description>
