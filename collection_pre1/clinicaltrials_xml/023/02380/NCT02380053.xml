	<brief_summary>What differential effect beta-blockers lung heart function exercise chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) ? COPD major cause illness death . Not individual suffer lung disease , COPD often lead illness , particularly heart disease . Beta-blockers successfully treat heart disease . It therefore logical one would want use treatment COPD patient heart disease . However , always concern beta-blockers could cause significant problem COPD worsen lung function , opposite effect inhaler use treat COPD open airway . Pointedly , increase evidence despite problem , COPD patient prescribe beta-blockers show gain benefit particularly term prevent death . In study , investigator therefore want examine beta-blocker might safest COPD patient , work slightly differently . Some beta-blockers may beneficial effect airways others , whilst still benefit heart . The investigator study two different beta-blockers ; one potentially narrow airways one potentially open airway . The investigator use cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( exercise bike measure heart lung function exercise ) look difference beta-blockers primarily term lung function also information heart . The investigator recruit people moderate severe COPD able complete cycle exercise test respiratory research department . The study last 10-12 week 5 main visit department serial exercise test , breathe test , simple heart function test simple blood test tell investigator effect beta-blockers heart lung .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) major cause illness death . In fact , 2020 , World Health Organization predict COPD become third leading cause death ( currently fourth ) , fifth lead cause disability ( currently twelfth ) worldwide . COPD cardiovascular ( heart ) disease intertwine due associate risk smoking related atherosclerosis . Beta-blockers generally avoid COPD patient due associate risk worsen lung function acute bronchospasm ( airway narrow ) due beta-2-receptor blockade . Despite concern recent Cochrane review show chronic beta-blockade `` cardioselective '' beta-blockers ( example bisoprolol ) preferentially block beta-1 ( mostly heart ) beta-2 ( mostly airway ) receptor well tolerate less beta-2-blockade subsequently less bronchospasm . Furthermore , observational study evaluate impact beta-blocker use COPD patient show benefit survival beta-blockers . We publish retrospective data 5,977 patient COPD mean follow 4.35 year , show patient use beta-blockers ( 88 % cardio-selective ) produce 22 % overall reduction death well significant reduction respiratory hospital admission oral steroid use . Beta-blockers pharmacologically different need assessment clinical consequence different beta-blockers COPD . Despite `` cardioselective '' , bisoprolol still show significant beta-2-receptor blockade usual treatment dos , result significant worsen Forced Expiratory Volume 1second - FEV1 ( major marker lung function ) follow chronic use . Celiprolol however unique beta-blocker addition beta-1-receptor blockade partial beta-2-agonist activity therefore cause bronchoconstriction interact short long act beta-agonist inhaler mainstay COPD treatment . Thus celiprolol might confer ideal profile use COPD ( i.e . good heart detrimental lung ) , especially severe patient even small fall FEV1 might significant consequence breathe exercise capacity . Poor exercise tolerance associate worsen quality life increase risk death thus provide valuable surrogate marker death . Worsening respiratory symptom COPD patient commonly see exertion rest , associate abnormal increase lung volume air breathe becomes trap completely escape breathing ( dynamic hyperinflation ) . Cardiopulmonary exercise test provide global assessment respiratory ( lung ) cardiovascular ( heart ) response exercise . Whilst study show worsen dynamic hyperinflation bisoprolol , due differ pharmacological property might celiprolol result worsen dynamic hyperinflation , whilst also demonstrate improvement cardiovascular outcome stroke volume ( pump function heart ) heart rate recovery follow exercise . Whether effect result improve exercise tolerance unknown . Another interesting property celiprolol reduce cholesterol increase High Density Lipoprotein ( HDL ) fraction confer partial beta-2-agonist activity . We also measure serum marker cardiac dysfunction ( B-type Natriuretic Peptide ( BNP ) Galectin-3 ) response beta-blockade investigator ' knowledge never perform COPD study . With regard measure cardiovascular outcome cardiac output stroke volume , investigator plan use novel non-invasive monitor base phenomenon bioreactance occur small alternate current pass chest . To investigator ' knowledge device never use assess cardiovascular response beta-blockers exercise , safe easy perform time standard exercise test . The investigator therefore wish ass relative effect celiprolol bisoprolol COPD patient establish whether proposed benefit survival beta-blockers COPD reflect improved cardiovascular respiratory response exercise importantly exercise tolerance . The investigator also want see celiprolol superior bisoprolol marker ( particularly lung function ) described . The information gather study invaluable provide information effect beta-blockers COPD use pump-prime large long-term study examine effect beta-blockers survival many COPD patient . Hypothesis The null hypothesis difference bisoprolol celiprolol term cardiorespiratory outcome incremental exercise test patient moderate severe COPD - specifically difference propose primary outcome measure dynamic hyperinflation cycle endurance test . Design The investigator choose randomise crossover design answer question unknown , either , beta-blocker might better lung function exercise capacity moderate severe COPD patient . The crossover design allow use patient comparators , thus allow investigator expose few patient medication statistical power parallel group study ( different patient group ) . Each participant therefore receive treatment sequence initial one decide random use randomisation algorithm . Importantly investigator use placebo control arm , already know beta-blockers benefit COPD patient ( particularly cardiovascular disease ) whereas placebo provide benefit . In word investigator drill see particular medication beneficial therapeutic profile . The justification use open-label beta-blockers pilot study help keep overall cost study stage investigation . Methods The investigator perform randomise , cross-over , open label trial bisoprolol versus celiprolol 10 people moderate severe COPD . The study last 10-12 week person . Potential participant recruit exist database volunteer COPD , contact either telephone , email post invite participate . Those invited receive write patient information document detailing requirement study extent participation attend screen visit . Participants give least 24hours read information document decide whether agree screen . The study include 5 visit department ( include screen visit ) various test outline . Each visit may last around 3 hour . If participant agree come along screen visit , ask withhold long-acting bronchodilator 48hours short act bronchodilator 6 hour standard practice confirm diagnosis airway obstruction / COPD use clinical pulmonary function measurement . Screening Visit At screen visit , information document discuss participant write informed consent obtain agree take part study . The follow performed : general medical examination doctor ; pregnancy test female ; lung function measurement ( spirometry , impulse oscillometry , reversibility salbutamol ) ; heart function measurement ( rest ECG [ electrocardiogram ] , echocardiogram possible do last year ) ; vital sign ( oxygen level , blood pressure , pulse ) ; 'practice ' cardiopulmonary exercise test ( confirm ability cycle counter 'learning effect ' future baseline exercise test ) ; baseline blood test . Inhaler technique also assess confirmed adequate . Participants find eligible remainder study test proceed 1 week run-in period usual medication come back first ( baseline ) visit . Those fulfil study criterion continue usual medication General Practitioner ( GP ) inform medically relevant data . Eligible participant provide portable monitor measure lung function , pulse oxygen saturation home twice daily record daily diary also include detail reliever use symptom . This diary kept throughout study . Study visit Prior participant attend first ( baseline ) study visit ask withhold short-acting reliever inhaler 6 hour . Participants require withhold long-acting bronchodilator study visit assess effect beta-blockers addition standard treatment confirm diagnosis COPD screen visit . Diary card review follow measurement record visit 1 : resting lung function ( impulse oscillometry , spirometry , whole body plethysmography ) ; rest ECG ; vital sign ; St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( disease specific quality life questionnaire ) ; blood sample ( BNP , Galectin , Cholesterol/HDL , Creatine Kinase ( CK ) , Potassium ) ; cardiopulmonary exercise test . Provided participant 's measurement still correspond inclusion exclusion criterion study , randomise one two beta-blocker treatment : Bisoprolol ( 2.5mg daily 2 week , 5mg daily approximately 2 week ) OR Celiprolol ( 200mg daily 2 week , 400mg daily approximately 2 week ) . Beta-blockers up-titrated home 2 week advice contact u side effect develop . Participants contact titration either telephone email . However , adverse effect occur high dose , participant allow drop back low dose remainder study period . At end treatment period , study measure repeat . After visit 2 participant approximately 1 week washout period prior give alternate beta-blocker treatment . End study After visit 4 participant complete study return usual medication . The overall study complete last enrolled participant complete protocol . Analysis final reporting All analysis perform end study . There interim analysis . The report publish high impact peer review journal .</detailed_description>
