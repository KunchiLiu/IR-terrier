	<brief_summary>Spinal mobilization spinal manipulation common technique utilized field physical therapy . Despite common utility , little known physiological mechanism underlie change experience follow intervention . Recent research suggest neurological mechanism may involve post interventional change , research support view still evolve . Therefore , study explore whether neurophysiological difference spinal manipulation spinal mobilization technique . The neurophysiological difference measure monitoring heart rate variability , cardiovagal indicator autonomic nervous system activity . The primary hypothesis study three-fold , first spinal manipulation result change heart rate variability different sham intervention . Second , spinal mobilization result change heart rate variability different sham intervention . Finally , investigator hypothesize spinal mobilization spinal manipulation produce different change heart rate variability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study utilize crossover design study autonomic nervous system responses healthy subject . Prior commence data collection , Institutional Review Board approval obtain Mount St. Mary 's College Committee Protection Human Subjects . Once obtained subject recruit faculty , student , staff College . A snowball methodology use recruit friend , family , acquaintances initial connection . To include study , candidate must age 18 55 year age . They must pain area body chronic nature ( present great three month ) . Subjects pregnant history spinal surgery exclude participation study . All subject fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion inform intent , method risk associate study give opportunity ask question . Following information session , agree participate study , subject ask fill attach informed consent form . All subject notify give opportunity withdrawal study time without repercussion . Once accept study , subject fill personal history questionnaire gather demographic information age , medical history , gender , current pain level . The subject also ask fill General Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale Questionnaire . Once collect , subject assign confidential subject number personal identifier remove subject information . All data scan stored personal computer password protect . Also time , subject randomly assign treatment group . Since crossover design , subject receive intervention , order intervention predetermine randomize . At point , subject take quiet room locate within Department Physical Therapy . This room use lab data collection room physical therapy treatment table . The subject ask lie prone table electrocardiographic record sensory place upon wrist ( two total ) . This sensory feed data regard heart rate laptop computer collect use Biocomm HRV Live ! Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) Data Acquisition program . Once strength stability signal verify , subject instruct rest quietly five minute order gather baseline heart rate data . Following five-minute timeframe , subject receive one three intervention base upon previously mention randomization process . The three intervention utilized study posterior anterior spinal manipulation deliver T4-5 spinal segment , posterior anterior spinal mobilization apply T4-5 spinal segment 30 second , sham therapeutic ultrasound apply T4-5 spinal region bilaterally 30 second ( ultrasound machine turn ) . Between intervention , subject instruct rest quietly five minute order stabilize body 's cardiovagal response . Following completion three intervention , subject allow ask additional question give number principal investigator IRB office contact question concern future .</detailed_description>
