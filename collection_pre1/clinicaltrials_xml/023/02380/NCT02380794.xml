	<brief_summary>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) due low limb arterial blockage affect significant proportion population age-adjusted prevalence approximately 12 % . Claudication induce walk impairment debilitate adversely affect social , leisure , occupational activity many patient associate high mortality among PAD patient . Unfortunately , effective therapy available improve leg symptom exercise performance PAD patient . Surgery last resort result vary . Therefore , large unmet need medical therapy improve long-term walking performance functional capacity PAD patient . Danshen Gegen ( D &amp; G ) commonly use Chinese herbal medicine treatment cardiovascular disease . D &amp; G study extensively research continue The Chinese University Hong Kong ( CUHK ) antioxidative vasodilator property , modulate anti-atherosclerosis improve arthrogenic athophysiology . Three randomized trial complete CUHK show D &amp; G improve lipid profile , vascular function thin internal layer carotid artery . One may expect low limb artery . Extensive clinical experience use China Hong Kong indicate D &amp; G well tolerate safe . This project randomize control trial determine efficacy Safety D &amp; G improve functional capacity &amp; QoL patient symptomatic PAD . The result study potential change local international practice provide much need therapeutic option treatment PAD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Treatment Intermittent Claudication Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease Using Danshen Gegen ( D &amp; G ) Capsule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease involve low limb become increasingly important health issue place considerable burden individual , community health care resource . PAD affect estimate 27 million adult &gt; 55 year age Europe North America ( 1 ) . The prevalence PAD Asia expect similar likely rise Chinese population age . Intermittent claudication affect patient PAD . Although IC limb-threatening , loss walk ability experience pain ambulation cause significant social , leisure , occupational impairment many patient ( 2-4 ) . The decreased QoL experience patient IC par cardiovascular disease heart failure heart attack . More alarmingly , physical disability associate high risk death among PAD patient . For reason patient chronically disabled , treatment IC increasingly become major clinical focus cardiovascular research . For PAD patient , critical focus therapy reduce underlie cardiovascular risk well improve functional status Qol . Although multiple therapy ( antiplatelet agent , statin , anti-hypertensive agent ) prove reduce cardiovascular risk PAD patient , therapeutic agent show improve symptom IC PAD patient ( 5 ) . As large unmet need term leg-specific therapy improve walk performance functional capacity debilitate disease . Traditional Chinese herbal medicine Danshen Gegen well establish treatment cardiovascular disease well tolerate patient . The study do Institute Chinese Medicine CUHK show particularly encouraging result ( 6-8 ) . The outcome study potential change local international practice provide novel therapeutic option treatment symptomatic PAD . As parallel laboratory research do identify active component D &amp; G formula preparation drug development , efficacy D &amp; G PAD offer assurance systemic effort .</detailed_description>
