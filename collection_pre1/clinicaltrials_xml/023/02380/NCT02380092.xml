	<brief_title>Post Market Clinical Follow Up LEGION™ Primary TKS With VERILAST™</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LEGION™ Primary Total Knee System ( TKS ) comprehensive , state-of-the-art system empowers surgeon address diverse surgical challenge provide personalize joint care . The LEGION™ Primary TKS implant design build legacy GENESIS™ II TKS . For 15 year 30 country , GENESIS™ II TKS achieve outstanding clinical outcome . As CE-mark 510k approval LEGION™ Primary TKS obtain , use clinical practice several country include Europe US clinical study need carry order confirm safety efficacy order conform medical device directive ( MEDDEV . 2.7.1 Rev.3 ) . This study therefore post-market study evaluate short- , mid- long-term safety effectiveness LEGION™ Primary TKS VERILAST™ bear surface ( combination OXINIUM™ femoral component highly cross-linked polyethylene tibial base plate insert ) . The clinical outcome large cohort subject treat LEGION™ Primary TKS part standard care document . The study design reflect standard clinical practice closely possible allows result study represent true clinical outcome would achieve clinical practice , maximum . Only subject treat LEGION™ Primary TKS part normally plan care screen participation study .</detailed_description>
