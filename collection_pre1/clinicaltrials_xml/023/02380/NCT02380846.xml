	<brief_summary>This study aim find consume different protein rice affect metabolism . Most meal investigator eat predominantly consist carbohydrate protein ( i.e . rice , noodle , bread etc meat seafood ) . However , still unknown consume different protein commonly eat carbohydrate affect metabolism . Previous study show protein stimulate hormone insulin , glucagon gut hormone . However , extent response depend protein type . The metabolic response carbohydrate also show greatly affected eaten protein . However , previous study use glucose carbohydrate still unknown eating protein carbohydrate food rice affect metabolism . Therefore , study initiate determine metabolic effect eat different protein type rice . Using common carbohydrate eaten Asia ( rice ) four commonly eat protein food ( egg , chicken , fish beancurd ) , study aim observe metabolic effect co-ingesting protein carbohydrate . The result data provide valuable insight metabolic effect protein-carbohydrate meal useful development practical advice dietary guideline chronic disease ( diabetes obesity ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study recruit 20 healthy Chinese male subject general public period one year . The test food rice , rice egg , rice fish , rice chicken rice beancurd.Potential participant come one morning overnight fast state consent screening procedure . Only fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion admit study . Each participant require come 5 non-consecutive day , session last approximately 4 hour . On day , participant arrive laboratory 8-9 follow overnight fast . An indwelling catheter insert vein forearm antecubital fossa keep patent . Baseline blood sample obtain give test food consume . Further blood sample take periodic interval subsequent 3.5 hour . Blood sample take every 15 minute first 60 minute every 30 minute remain 150 minute . At every time point blood sample extract finger prick ( measure glucose ) cannula ( measure metabolite ) . At time point subject fill visual analogue scale feeling hunger satiety .</detailed_description>
