	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) frequent pathology lead major morbidity mortality young people . Cerebral flood flow maintenance major goal direct therapy improve prognosis patient . Due cerebral-myocardial interaction , myocardial dysfunction might occur early phase traumatic brain injury . This myocardial dysfunction could partly responsible decrease cerebral blood flow . In case , improve myocardial dysfunction may help increase cerebral blood flow improve patient prognosis . In clinical practice easy non invasive way explore myocardial dysfunction transthoracic echocardiography . The objective trial investigate myocardial dysfunction early phase traumatic brain injury , compare control group without TBI .</brief_summary>
