	<detailed_description>MODEL OF SURGICAL REMOVAL OF TOOTH IMPACTION . The model Dental Impaction Pain Model ( DIPM ) utilize acute pain model . Its popularity due well-established , well-validated , extensively use postsurgery pain model assess efficacy analgesic inflammatory pain . The surgical procedure standardize surgery require either minimal nothing use CNS depressant anesthetic . The methodology similar model acute pain ; however , DIPM much versatile model . The model easily adapt carry study multiple-dose , pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics , preventive intervention analgesic efficacy The impacted low third molar extraction involve manipulation hard soft tissue , make patient undergoes series effect include acute pain , inflammation trismus immediate postoperative period go 24 72 postoperative hour . The pain associated surgical removal third molar moderate severe , increase great intensity first 24 hour surgery spike pain first six eight hour use conventional local anesthetic . In context , control pain inflammation post-surgical associated third molar removal vary ; highlight use anti-inflammatory pain reliever non ( NSAIDs ) opioids . PAIN . Pain define perception potentially injurious stimulus ; jointly several pleasurable experience ( sensory , emotional cognitive ) , cause tissue damage ( actual , potential described term damage ) manifest certain reaction physiological , autonomic behavioral . Pain typically classify either acute chronic . Acute pain : sudden onset usually result clearly define cause injury . The acute pain include estimate time necessary tissue heal , describe John Bonica 1953 , usually span month , accord Committee taxonomy pain IASP , length limit sharp pain three month , however note author continue classify pain acute duration 6 month . Chronic pain : define pain last 12 week , one accord characteristic origin , exceeds time could usually define similar pain . It accompany psychological commitment important behavior disorder lead depressive state ; depend individual baseline emotional . Although also classified accord structure ( somatic visceral ) origin physiological mechanism ( nociceptive neuropathic ) . The scheme perceive pain need : ) peripheral structure act receiver ; b ) synapse spinal cord , c ) pathways spinal cord superiority center ) descend pathways superiority center marrow , act mainly inhibitory mechanism also facilitate change neurotransmitter . The study neurophysiology pain important advance knowledge mechanism painful stimulus perioperative period describe dynamic system multiple input place nociceptive , condition first stage peripheral awareness amplifies transmission stimulation condition second tier central sensitization keep time . MEASUREMENT OF PAIN . Clinicians researcher recognize pain multidimensional experience , include number quality measurable element intensity , involvement , sensory quality , quality spatial ( location ) , temporary quality , impact daily activity . While focus measurement pain remain intensity , increase interest measure elements pain . PAIN INTENSITY SCALES . The domain pain use clinical study research intensity pain . The three scale use measure intensity pain : ) visual analog ( VAS scale ) , b ) scale numeric value ( NRS ) c ) verbal value ( VRS ) . STRATEGIES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DENTAL PAIN . In dental practice pain moderate severe intensity condition usually treat Nonstereoidal anti-inflammatory ( NSAIDs ) drug , although different type drug use purpose described : - NASAIDs class drug provide analgesic antipyretic effect . Since mechanism action common base inhibition cyclooxygenase ( COX ) enzyme responsible biosynthesis prostaglandins general Eicosanoids . Unfortunately , prostaglandin mediate physiological function cause undesirables adverse effect . - New inhibitor COX show great power analgesic effectiveness well reduce incidence adverse effect compare classic AINEÂ´S . DEXKETOPROFEN TROMETAMOL . Dexketoprofen new anti-inflammatory drug non-steroidal ( NSAID ) belong family arylpropionic acid derivative . Dexketoprofen enantiomer S ( + ) composite ketoprofen , drug analgesic effect anti-inflammatory clearly document . Dexketoprofen develop ( dexketoprofen trometamol ) tromethamine salt formulation high free acid aqueous solubility . Pharmacokinetic study perform healthy individual show oral administration dexketoprofen trometamol present kinetic favorable profile use acute pain compare formulation free acid racemic ketoprofen . Dexketoprofen trometamol , one powerful inhibitor prostaglandin synthesis `` vitro '' . 12.5-25 mg orally give quickly absorb empty stomach , strong binding albumin inactive metabolite glucuronization renal excretion . It well accumulate synovial fluid analgesic potency comparable 50 mg ketoprofen diclofenac 600 mg ibuprofen , main indication acute postoperative pain . The production unique isomer ketoprofen formulation simplifies pharmacokinetics drug allow reduction 50 % dose . This reduce adverse effect reduce metabolic renal work , rapid absorption appear offer protection gastrointestinal complication method avoid gastrointestinal toxicity different selectivity COX present good profile security report adverse effect similar placebo study , uniqueness therapeutic profile DKP.TRIS could result combination factor include high power give active molecule , inhibition COX two isoenzymes , rapid absorption gastrointestinal tract high capacity enter CNS . PREVENTIVE ANALGESIA . Preventive analgesia ( PA ) antinociceptive treatment prevents establishment alter process sensory input , amplify chronic postoperative pain . The PA concept formulate Crile begin century basis clinical observation . There two term English refer concept : preemptive analgesia , consist treatment give surgical incision maintain intervention avoid alter sensory processing amplifies chronic postoperative pain . Is usually compare way drug management incision ; preventive analgesia consist longer lasting analgesic effect would theoretically expect administration certain drug basis pharmacological property . In oral surgery , primary hyperalgesia awareness receiver mucosa periosteum range mediator inflammation prostaglandin . Secondary hyperalgesia central sensitization neuron nucleus trigeminal spinal supra structure . Secondary hyperalgesia observe time , primary hyperalgesia provable within hour injury ; Prostaglandins synthesize quickly damage tissue appear significant concentration 1 hour trauma . The concept preventive analgesia base prior administration surgical incision painkiller dampen prevent phenomenon hypersensitisation central order reduce consumption analgesic postoperative period . WORK PLAN . Using format specify inclusion exclusion criterion , selection patient hold , visit also fill form demographic data , status patient , current condition , medical history , physical examination , x-ray diagnostic study . See annex 3 . Then patient randomize distributed two group participant , group 1 2 : Experimental drug . The randomized patient determine group accord administration drug two group . GROUP 1 Oral administration dexketoprofen Trometamol 25 mg , 30 minute begin surgery administer immediately end placebo . GROUP 2 The placebo oral administer 30 minute begin surgery administer immediately end dexketoprofen Trometamol 25 mg. Surgical procedure . All surgery perform surgeon , achieve local anesthetic effect , previous asepsis antisepsis area necessary . The low alveolar nerve reinforcement lingual nerve long buccal nerve use 2 cartridge lidocaine epinephrine 2 % concentration 1:100 ml . Once anaesthetic effect present , surgery perform , flap total thickness mucoperiosteal make , use triangular incision design liberate tissue level second mandibular molar , subsequently third molar extraction perform . Finally reposition flap suture make use black silk suture ( 3-0 ) . In case duration surgery procedure register every step . see annex 4 . Measurement variable . Intensity pain . For group , measure perform distance mm point 0 point patient indicate ; understand point represent intensity pain use NRS , value register NRS scale patient . This procedure begin second intake drug placebo ( basal ) , 8 hour ( 8-NRS ) , 24 hour , 48 hour 72 hour post operatory . Time remedication . The time minute patient request remedication dexketoprofen , register intensity pain register . Total tablet consume . The number tablet consume 72 hr postoperative record . The dosage dexketoprofen 25mg standardized every 8 hour , exceed 75mg every 24 hour patient deems necessary . The antibiotic use clinical trial : Clindamycin 300 mg every 8 hr 5 day . After 7 day postoperative evolution , patient return clinic removal stitch , evaluate operative area general health condition , step , attention conclude surgical procedure medical discharge indicate .</detailed_description>
