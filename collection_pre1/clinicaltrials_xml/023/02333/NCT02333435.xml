	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer , frequently diagnose cancer among occidental men , associate major individual societal burden . Although still controversial , literature suggest high consumption omega-3 fatty acid ( ω3 ) protective effect prostate cancer . One propose mechanism action ω3 lie anti-inflammatory property . In addition , observational evidence suggest association ω3 intake low rate depression cancer patient . However , clinical study test efficacy ω3 supplementation psychological quality life outcomes population . Several evidence point possible involvement inflammation psychological issue . Reducing systemic inflammatory state may beneficial impact quality life patient . Preliminary work team investigator , cohort patient manage active surveillance low-grade prostate cancer , show strong inverse association risk prostate cancer progression ( high-grade ) level prostatic eicosapentanoic acid ( EPA- type ω3 ) . HYPOTHESIS : EPA-rich monoglycerides fish oil ( MAG-EPA ) global positive effect prostate cancer cell proliferation , inflammation patient 's psychosocial functioning quality life . The investigator propose double blind , randomize control clinical trial . 130 consecutive patient suffer high-risk prostate cancer choose treat radical prostatectomy eligible study . The presence high-grade cancer mandatory . The intervention , daily supplementation 3g supplement fish oil monoglycerides rich EPA , vs. placebo capsule contain high oleic sunflower oil , start six week prostatectomy continue one year surgery . The potential confounding variable measure start intervention : age , anthropometric parameter , stage clinical pathological tumor grade ( Gleason score ) , pre-operative level prostate specific antigen diet . This project propose simple intervention dietary supplementation could eventually help reduce incidence and/or progression prostate cancer , consequence treatment , thus could contribute diminish heavy individual societal burden prostate cancer . The clinical data generate trial serve solid basis large-scale phase III clinical trial .</brief_summary>
