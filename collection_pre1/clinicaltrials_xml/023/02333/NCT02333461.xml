Interfering GOAT pathway inhibit ghrelin activation possibly diminish food intake lipid storage . This concept support animal study weight gain high fat diet model prevent GOAT inhibit . Ghrelin level positively associate stress , sleep deprivation , caloric restriction . Weight loss induce exercise positive association ghrelin level caloric restriction alone . Ghrelin level influence diet composition , however , result vary considerably trial . Over 160 botanical extract internal ingredient library screen single concentration inhibition DGAT-1 GOAT . Botanicals identify least 75 % activity titrate identify IC50 value &lt; 25 g/ml less . We narrow list viable ingredient look activity DGAT-1 GOAT vitro enzyme bioassay model . The top performing botanical evaluate cellular model DGAT-1 inhibition . Those high inhibition activity model consider lead candidate . A preliminary literature search conduct final filter include factor cost regulatory acceptability result four ingredient test current clinical protocol.Our objective determine whether four ingredient similar mechanistic effect human body .</detailed_description>
