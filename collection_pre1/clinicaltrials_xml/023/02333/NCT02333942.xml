	<brief_title>Dementia Signal Development Study Nautilus NeuroWave TM Detection Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-blinded study subject present UCSF Memory Aging Clinic ( MAC ) neurodegenerative disease cognitive dysfunction . The primary objective non-significant risk study signature development . The goal develop signal algorithm use Nautilus NeuroWaveTM dementia . This accomplish analyze processing Nautilus NeuroWave recording patient confirm dementia . All subject enrol recording obtain least 10 follow subject cohort : Moderate Severe Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration ( FTDL ) , Alzheimer 's Disease , Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) Age Matched Normal Controls . As study feasibility study intend determine whether Nautilus NeuroWave able generate distinctive signal correlate dementia , statistical analysis require . Similarly , study power attain particular level statistical significance . Subsequent study measure sensitivity specificity result dementia signal pattern generate study . These future study subject statistical analysis . The Jan Medical Nautilus NeuroWaveTM ( NNW ) non-invasive device design evaluate brain oscillation pattern brain 's pulse , generate cardiac cycle induce intracranial blood flow . The objective evaluation determine whether oscillation pattern normal , whether disrupt , , disrupt , particular disruption pattern evident . Various cerebral pathology study date NNW demonstrate distinct disruption pattern . These pathology include vasospasm , concussion arterio-venous malformation ( AVM ) . The objective study evaluate brain oscillation pattern subject MCI , Frontotemporal dementia , AD small cohort age match normal control determine whether exhibit pattern disruption , , quantify categorize distinct disruption pattern . How Nautilus NeuroWave accomplishes explain later device description section protocol .</detailed_description>
