	<brief_summary>This blind randomize control trial ass effectiveness manual therapy improve hip abduction strength patient acute anterior knee pain . The primary objective study see manual therapy gluteus medius significantly alter within-session measurement hip abductor strength patient anterior knee pain . The secondary objective study see manual therapy gluteus medius significantly alter within session pain patient anterior knee pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>People anterior knee pain significant hip abductor muscle weakness compare healthy people ( Prins , 2009 ) . Hip abductor weakness strong correlation impair low extremity mechanic increase pain functional activity ( Stickler et al . 2014 ) . A study Roach et al 2013 find 97 % patient anterior knee pain trigger point gluteus medius muscle , 23 % healthy control trigger point . Trigger point alter normal muscle activity increase pain patient ( Lucas , 2010 , Ibarra et al 2011 ) . Hip abduction strengthen find significantly decrease pain improve function patient anterior knee pain ( Earl , 2011 ) . By decrease trigger point gluteus medius investigator may able increase hip abduction strength reduce pain dysfunction patient anterior knee pain . Both Dry Needling ( DN ) Soft Tissue Mobilization ( STM ) manual therapy intervention commonly use physical therapist decrease trigger point muscle . Currently , research examine effectiveness manual therapy treat trigger point improve hip abductor strength patient anterior knee pain . Clinically , investigator note patient treat STM DN investigator see immediate improvement hip abduction strength . The investigator know noted improvement result repeated strength test practice actual improve firing strength muscle . The primary objective study see manual therapy gluteus medius significantly alter within-session measurement hip abductor strength patient anterior knee pain . The secondary objective study see manual therapy gluteus medius significantly alter within session pain patient anterior knee pain . Patients refer physical therapy clinic anterior knee pain consider study . After explain study answer patient parent question , informed consent obtain individual wish participate . The participant screen see meet inclusion criterion , randomly treatment group ( Dry Needling , Soft Tissue Mobilization , Placebo control ) . This single blind research study assessor blind intervention . The therapist performs hip abductor strength measurement therapist performs experimental intervention . The patient blind treatment receive . The therapist perform intervention open seal envelope allocate patient Dry Needling , Soft Tissue Mobilization , Sham Needling group . Following experimental intervention patient perform hip core exercise protocol . Pre-treatment evaluation measure take patient blind assessor . These consist : - Hand hold dynamometer hip abduction strength measurement . - Pain single leg squat The subject receive appropriate treatment base his/her random assignment experimental treatment group treat therapist . Post-treatment evaluation measure take patient blind assessor immediately follow treatment . These measure take pre-treatment . - Hand hold dynamometer hip abduction strength measurement . - Pain single leg squat Patients perform hip core exercise protocol , Following exercise Post-Exercise evaluation measure blind assessor . These measure take pre-treatment .</detailed_description>
