	<detailed_description>The lead preventable cause death people 18 45 , world-wide , military civilian uncontrolled internal bleeding i.e . hemorrhage . ( A. Sauaia et al , J. Trauma 38 , 185-193 ( 1995 ) ) . Internal bleed difficult reliably detect visible external injury rate blood loss rapid . Two known lead indicator blood loss fluctuation hematocrit blood protein concentration . Monitoring either analytes require blood draw least 3-5 minute obtain single measurement . The LighTouch device shine imperceptible red light skin measure light come back use method Raman Spectroscopy . Some light color shift . Using proprietary numerical recipe , LighTouch device combine signal remit light calculates hematocrit , glucose , protein potentially analytes . Thus LighTouch device produce information without painful physical insult patient trend change blood analytes order predict need intervention . Previous IRB approve clinical trial last 10 year demonstrate useful performance blood glucose hematocrit protein analytes ready test . Since hematocrit protein concentration change hemodialysis provide ideal model monitor fluctions time assess precision accuracy LighTouch device analytes . This technique affect usual dialysis treatment way . The subject place one finger machine exposure incoming light signal sensor within machine detect light scatter specfic analytes hematocrit . Literally hundreds individual experience LighTouch device since 1999 never unpleasant response adverse outcome . The system analagous laser pointer shin one 's finger-tip . The ultimate goal research develop device reliable non-invasive measure critical blood element determine patient 's side .</detailed_description>
