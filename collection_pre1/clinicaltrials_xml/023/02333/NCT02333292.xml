	<brief_summary>Objectives : 1 ) To evaluate la proportion hepatitic C virus ( HCV ) -monoinfected patient show sustained virologic response ( SVR ) treatment include direct-acting antiviral ( DAAs ) clinical practice clinical unit treat infectious disease 2 ) determine frequency adverse event , include severe and/or cause treatment interruption , DAA-based therapy setting . Design : Multicentric , prospective post-authorised cohort study . Setting : Hospitals Hepatitis Study Group ( GEHEP ) Spanish Society Infectious Diseases Microbiology ( SEIMC ) . Study population : HCV-monoinfected patient initiate DAA-based treatment outside clinical trial . Variables : The primary efficacy outcome variable proportion patient reach undetectable HCV-RNA 12 week schedule end therapy ( SVR12 ) . The primary safety outcome variable percentage subject discontinue therapy due adverse event . Statistical analysis : A descriptive study perform , well double sensibility analysis frequency SVR12 use intention-to-treat on-treatment approach . Those variable associate SVR12 p-value &lt; 0.2 include logistic regression analysis SVR12 dependent variable .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The incidence hepatic decompensations mortality reduce considerable patient achieve sustain virologic response ( SVR ) therapy hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . With arrival direct-acting antiviral ( AAD ) HCV , rate SVR significantly high achieve pegylated interferon ( peg-IFN ) combination ribavirin ( RBV ) . Therefore , AADs could high impact context . Therefore , triple therapy HCV genotype 1 base first-generation protease inhibitor ( PI ) telaprevir ( TVR ) boceprevir ( BOC ) plus peg-IFN/RBV become standard therapy 2011 SVR rate high 68 % -75 % reach treatment-na√Øve patient . In treatment-experienced subject , retreatment triple therapy result high SVR rate observe dual therapy alone , however , treatment success strongly depend previous response pattern . Unfortunately , combination base TVR BOC well tolerate , treatment complex , cost high pharmacological interaction frequently observe . The next generation DAAs offer increase response rate , furthermore , good safety pattern TVR BOC . Additionally , dose new DAAs easier convenient , pharmacological interaction newer DAAs easy manage even relevant . The FDA approve second-generation PI simeprevir , HCV non-structural ( NS ) protein NS 5B inhibitor sofosbuvir , well inhibitor NS 5A daclatasvir ledipasvir . Apart well efficacy , safety convenience , new DAAs active HCV genotypes 1 . Finally , new DAAs administer interferon-free regimen therefore offer treatment option interferon-intolerant individual contraindication peg-IFN . Therefore , near future , vast majority HCV monoinfected patient treated combination include DAA . Currently , main problem high cost DAAs challenge health system . In spite positive prospect regard response rate DAAs , number question answer soon possible . On one hand , information efficacy safety DAAs available date derive clinical trial reflect circumstance clinical practice . In context , clinical trial usually include considerably low proportion patient certain characteristic , cirrhotics . Data French cohort CUPIC reveal subgroup show low tolerability TVR BOC report pivotal clinical trial . In fact , data obtain cohort result change treatment guideline HCV monoinfected patient publish Spanish Agency Medicines . On contrary , evidence base observation make within expanded access program study HEP3002 individual advance fibrosis show efficacy safety profile treat triple therapy similar observe clinical trial within CUPIC cohort . Nevertheless , study , exclusion criterion follow-up comparable apply clinical trial . Therefore , study population may reflect exactly patient profile see real-life . Currently , information distinct aspect treatment HCV include DAAs real-life condition Spain scarce . Clinicians Infectious Diseases Units treat high number HCV monoinfected patient . These physician confront patient population history drug abuse predominant , majority individual consume inject drug , frequently suffer psychiatric pathology receive concomitant therapy cause problem regard drug-drug interaction adherence . Also , HCV genotype distribution different observe Hepatology Units , genotype 1a predominant compare 1b , 3 4 . Taken account mention , factor could cause different rate SVR DAAs , interruption voluntary drop-outs compare report , especially difficult-to-treat population .</detailed_description>
