	<brief_title>A Single Ascending Dose Escalation Investigate Safety PK VVZ-149 Injection Healthy Older Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VVZ-149 injection , investigational product ( IP ) clinical study , multi-target analgesic drug candidate glycine transporter type II ( GlyT2 ) serotonin receptor 2A ( 5HT2A ) . The target receptor know play important role induction transmission pain signal pain-related neural system . There effort develop new drug selectively antagonize GlyT2 5HT2A , unsuccessful due limitation single-target drug . VVZ-149 show morphine-comparable analgesic gabapentin-comparable anti-allodynic effect various rat model pain .</detailed_description>
