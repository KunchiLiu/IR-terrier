	<brief_summary>This study formulate determine efficacy passive oral motor regimen drool child multiple disability . Seven subject age 7-19yrs take study . All subject receive passive treatment include light touch , stroke , vibration , tap , pressure stretch . All technique prove effective treat drooling . Relative sterility hygiene maintain throughout procedure sterilize glove napkin use . The measurement protocol design check effectiveness drool child . The protocol give 4 week treatment session give 3 time per week treatment duration 30min . Twelve session oral motor stimulation therapy give 4 week . Thirteen 4 week treatment , improvement find term severity well . Primary outcome measure take Drooling Frequency Severity rating scale secondary outcome measure take drool quotient . Pre post intervention score Drooling Frequency Severity rating scale drool quotient take data analyze use wilcoxon sign rank test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Passive Oral Motor Therapy Drooling Children With Multiple Disabilities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title To formulate see efficacy passive oral motor regimen drool child multiple disability Background Drooling range mild embarrassment discomfort intellectually intact patient minimal drool gross emotional physical impairment severely affect individual . Drooling produce unhygienic condition may associate disagreeable odour . Drooling affect social physical wellbeing child may represent problem caregiver . Many person severe profound disability exhibit chronic excessive drooling , unfavourable effect socialization health . Studies suggest various treatment like medication , surgery , behaviour modification , myofunctional therapy oral motor therapy effective treat drool single protocol develop treat drool child multiple disability . Passive treatment protocol need specifically design child able follow command various treatment technique like behaviour modification , over-correction ca n't apply . Present study aim formulate see efficacy passive oral motor regimen drool child multiple disability . Methodology Seven subject age group 07-19 year select accessible population . Informed consent take parents/caregivers.Severity frequency drool access ( For subject prior study ) Drool Quotient calculate ( For subject prior study ) . Patient sit position back fully support head neutral position home . Therapist stand position front patient.Therapist wear sterilised glove ensure infection occurs along change glove every subject . Light touch apply mid line lip ( 3 time , 5 sec ) . Maintained pressure apply around lip ( 3 time 3 sec ) . Gentle tap cheek apply index finger ( 8 time cheek ) . Quick , gentle stretch apply outward index middle finger middle upper lip lower lip ( 8 time lip ) . Gentle stroke cheek applied index finger base nose towards ear . Then return back corner lip ( 8 time cheek ) , repeat side . Gentle stroke applied area around lip circular manner , corner towards center corner , reverse . ( 4 time lip ) . Vibration slowly apply 10-15 sec ) orbicularis oris b ) Both side larynx chin sternal notch c ) Under chin ear ear.Quick stretch apply masseter muscle ( 3 time side ) . Stretch pressure apply vibrated area , ) orbicularis oris b ) Laryngopharyngeal muscle , side . Intra-orally applied light touch roof mouth , anteriorly 3 time . The protocol give 4 week treatment session give 3 time per week .</detailed_description>
