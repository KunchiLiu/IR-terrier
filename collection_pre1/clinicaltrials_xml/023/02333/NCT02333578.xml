	<detailed_description>This pilot trial treat subject ECP Group ECP derive two donor . ECP provide ECPSDU comprise 90 - 110mL plasma two individual ABO-compatible donor . Two ECPSDU administer immediately sequential infusion . Subjects may receive three dos ECP le 48 hour apart . ECP provide Plasma Frozen Within 24 Hours After Phlebotomy ( PF24 ) describe Section 6.1 . Pre-treatment frequent post-treatment blood specimen assay anti-EBOV antibody EBOV viral load RT-PCR obtain subject . The pharmacodynamic effect ECP anti-EBOV , include neutralization titer , viral load examine ECP Group . Changes individual treatment group clinical laboratory parameter time describe . Between-group within-group examine interaction clinical parameter , outcome , ECP total dose , EBOV viral load , anti-EBOV ( IgG ELISAs Zaire GP residues 1-649 irradiated Zaire virus , anti-EBOV PRNT ) .
