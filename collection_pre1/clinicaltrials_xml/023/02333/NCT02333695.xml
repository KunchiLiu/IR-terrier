	<detailed_description>A medical device magnetic therapy spinal cord injury ( SCI ) disclose . The apparatus comprise combination several magnet enclose supportive cover . The magnet place proper position polarity change time without difficulty . The device provide source stimulation nerve achieve therapeutic result rehabilitation patient spinal trauma stroke . A spinal cord injury — damage part spinal cord nerve end spinal canal — often cause permanent change strength , sensation body function site injury . Many scientist optimistic advance research someday make repair spinal cord injury possible . Research study ongoing around world . In meantime , treatment rehabilitation allow many people spinal cord injury lead productive , independent life . The effect SCI depend type injury level injury . SCI divide two type injury - complete incomplete . Complete : A complete injury mean function level injury ; sensation voluntary movement . Both side body equally affected . Incomplete : An incomplete injury mean functioning primary level injury . A person incomplete injury may able move one limb another , may able feel part body move , may function one side body . With advance acute treatment SCI , incomplete injury become common . Spinal Magnetic Stimulation ( SMS ) relatively new way use magnetism affect spinal cord . It non-invasive , meaning procedure require type surgery ; rather , conduct transmit magnetic pulse Spinal Cord press machine back . The Long term goal research project implementation effective , inexpensive therapy patient spinal cord injury . Another objective development cheap , presentable comfortable magnetic device cause neural stimulation stop reversing sign symptoms Spinal Cord injury . The short-term objective prove magneto stimulation intervention reverse sign symptom Spinal Cord injury early moderate State</detailed_description>
