	<detailed_description>Reaching consistent level 25 ( OH ) D show crucial decreasing fall , fracture increase calcium absorption . One way circumvent variability 25 ( OH ) D response vitamin D might use calcifediol supplementation bypass 25-hydroxylase enzyme entirely . This approach also permit physician achieve desire serum level matter day , rather several week require use native vitamin D. Compared native vitamin D , calcifediol water soluble , short half-life increase 25 ( OH ) D level quickly . Calcifediol also potent , 3.5 time potent raise 25 ( OH ) D level vitamin D. Its water solubility may also confer advantage patient difficulty absorb fat soluble vitamin . This form vitamin D metabolite use historically increase calcium absorption , treat osteomalacia , increase Bone Mineral Density ( BMD ) . Using calcifediol seem practical solution , little know dose response variability human compare native vitamin D. The investigator intend perform clinical study healthy subject pharmacokinetics different dos Hy.D Calcifediol compare vitamin D3 ( cholecalciferol ) order gain insight dose response relationship assess kinetic difference include steady state . The metabolite 1,25 ( OH ) 2D , 24,25 ( OH ) 2D assess throughout study assess metabolism vitamin D vs. 25 ( OH ) D. Vitamin D3 measure throughout study ass compliance restriction exogenous vitamin D supplementation .</detailed_description>
