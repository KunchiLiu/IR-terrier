	<brief_title>Saving Lives Birth : Primary Prevention Periodontal Disease Relation Preterm Birth Malawi</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significance Impact : Adverse birth outcomes related length gestation ( preterm birth ) recognize one significant disorder maternal-child health global scale . In developed world , preterm birth rate approximate 7 % . In Malawi , investigator recently demonstrate rate triple approximate 26.1 % . Of 4 million newborn death annually , nearly 1/3 ( 27 % ) directly attributable prematurity another 36 % secondary relate opportunistic infection ( sepsis , pneumonia , gastrointestinal ) . 75 % 4 million death occur within first week life , vast majority occur first 48 hour . For survive , persistent lifelong risk due stunt growth , chronic infection , retinopathy prematurity , bronchopulmonary dysplasia . The link maternal oral health ( periodontal disease particular ) risk preterm birth demonstrate across population ( rural urban , industrialized develop region ) study date . However , multiple randomize controlled trial treatment active periodontal disease scale plan pregnancy fail demonstrate significant benefit prevent preterm birth . Why would maternal oral health impact preterm birth ? In rodent , subcutaneous inoculation periodontal pathogen cause dose-dependent decrease pup weight , elicit inflammatory response trigger preterm birth present amniotic fluid . Periodontitis ( define destructive inflammation periodontium ) prevalence 30 % great woman child bear age . By definition , involve microbial infiltration periodontium , stimulate chronic inflammatory response , recurrent bacteremia , production cytokine prostaglandins trigger risk preterm birth . It production prostaglandins felt mediate risk preterm birth . So investigator know biologic evidence periodontitis related preterm birth , treat active periodontitis reduce morbidity , possible prevent periodontitis might prevent preterm birth low birth weight ? If , least expensive efficacious preventative measure ? The investigator ' overarch hypothesis comprehensive primary preterm birth prevention , inclusive maternal oral health xylitol chew gum ( intervention ) , reduce rate periodontal disease caries , preterm birth prevalence , neonatal mortality .</detailed_description>
