	<brief_summary>New-onset raise blood pressure ( BP ) affect one ten pregnancy . For woman , raise BP indication pre-eclampsia : newly arise high blood pressure pregnancy combine protein leak urine . After birth , woman 's BP remain elevated period time , case return normal 2-12 week . During period medication need adjust achieve correct control . Research suggest good BP control period associate improved long-term health outcome . The investigator would like find whether home BP monitoring , self-adjustment medication accord individualised protocol , could improve BP control patient satisfaction . This pilot study set inform plan large-scale multi-centre randomise control trial test feasibility protocol . The investigator want increase experience apply management approach subset patient ; select appropriate primary outcome measure estimate effect size intervention ; ass recruitment potential ; evaluate feasibility coordinate trial across several centre . The primary objective large-scale trial determine whether self-management approach improve BP control woman medicate hypertensive disorder pregnancy postnatal period . Women recruit study randomly assign one two group : self-management usual care . Participants allocate 'usual care ' BP monitor medication adjust general practitioner ( GP ) midwife normal . Participants allocate 'self-management ' group use home BP monitor daily follow discharge hospital birth . They provide individualised schedule gradually decrease medication ( ) line BP reading .

	<brief_title>Self-management Postnatal Anti-hypertensive Treatment : Trial Development Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertensive disorder pregnancy ( HDP ) affect 3-15 % pregnancy . Gestational hypertension new-onset blood pressure ( BP ) &gt; 140/90mmHg 20 week gestation . Pre-eclampsia gestational hypertension proteinuria ( &gt; 300mg / 24 hour ) . HDP second commonest direct cause maternal death UK USA , lead cause maternal death Latin America Caribbean . HDP persist postpartum , complication occur time . Most woman HDP treatment-free 3 month postpartum . This rapidly change BP , shift medication requirement , pose challenge term best manage down-titration . Both NICE guideline Cochrane review highlight clinical study address management BP postpartum . In practice clinical care continue antepartum anti-hypertensive medication monitor BP community focus prevention over-treatment . Approximately 30 % eclamptic seizure occur postpartum : study suggest half occur 48 hour birth . A case series patient sustain stroke association HDP , show half occur postpartum . Severity hypertension later life may predict BP first 6 week postpartum . Several retrospective cohort study meta-analysis suggest HDP associate increase risk future cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) mother . The 2011 American Heart Association guideline prevention CVD woman cite history HDP major risk factor CVD , advocate enquire pregnancy complication evaluation CVD risk . Home BP reading show strongly related index target organ damage well prognostic value essential hypertension office BP measurement . Voluntary home BP monitoring patient essential hypertension become increasingly common . The European American Societies Hypertension recommend home BP measurement routine diagnosis monitor essential hypertension . Self-monitoring self-titration anti-hypertensive medication essential hypertension show feasible effective usual care . Women HDP would seem ideal cohort apply experience : disease , general , limited time course mean intensive monitoring reasonable likely adhere . Pregnant woman young age group majority essential hypertension , may comfortable use technology assist disease monitoring . Women might also empower set recent pregnancy take great responsibility health . Evidence exist support accuracy home BP recording hypertensive pregnant woman . Studies date antenatal woman suggest low non-concordance rate low rate inaccurate recording . Studies also suggest : good correlation home BP recording indication need anti-hypertensive medication ; reduce number hospital admission woman mild HDP undertook home BP monitoring . If self-management postpartum period prove feasible , acceptable successful , could lead reduction length inpatient stay , readmission number postpartum visit , cost-saving implication . Furthermore importance BP control immediate postpartum period already demonstrate affect woman 's CVD risk 15 year delivery , strategy , successfully increase woman 's adherence effective treatment regimen , potential influence healthcare need well future . The propose trial aim apply research experience regard self-management essential hypertension postpartum woman HDP high low BPs lead adverse outcome , detection on-going hypertension essential . This study pilot study : set order inform plan large-scale multi-centre randomise control trial test feasibility method procedure later use large scale . We want increase experience apply management approach subset patient ; select appropriate primary outcome measure estimate effect size intervention ; ass recruitment potential ; evaluate feasibility coordinate trial across several centre . The primary objective large-scale trial determine whether self-management approach improve BP control woman medicate HDP postnatal period . The study non-blinded randomise controlled trial . To assist recruitment number , assess feasibility run multi-centre trial , plan run study several hospital . Women develop HDP require medication approach antenatal period : complete informed consent form undertake screen appointment . Following birth , whilst remain hospital , consent confirm baseline appointment take place . At visit woman randomise one two treatment arm : usual care , self-management . All woman follow 10 day , 4 6 week , 3 6 month postpartum BP measure one study team . All participant ask complete EQ-5D-5L Health Questionnaire ass quality life visit 1 , 5 7 . At visit 2 , 6 7 woman weigh use standardise set scale order evaluate whether extent speed return book weight correlate resolution gestational hypertension . To follow work suggest above-average BP six week postpartum approximately 30 % increase aortic stiffness , plan conduct sub-study analyse marker vascular risk woman group . As may assume baseline characteristic two group similar , demonstrate treatment effect intervention , allow u analyse relationship BP control postnatal period marker vascular risk help determine severity pathology effectiveness control determine long term outcome . Women consent optional extended visit baseline 3 month measure arterial stiffness microvascular change take ( cardio-ankle vascular index , radial arterial tonometry capillaroscopy ) . We take blood sample measure circulate biomarkers relevant cardiovascular health pre-eclampsia . We aim recruit minimum 15 woman group . We plan run second embed sub-study examine participant ' health experience . We aim recruit minimum 50 % participant group . We conduct structure interview participant arm , consent participate qualitative sub-study , assess experience either usual care self-management BP postnatal period , identify explore factor relate successful ( unsuccessful ) implementation intervention . This study provide data regard view patient acceptability self-monitoring routine management gestational hypertension pre-eclampsia birth discharge hospital . Baseline data ( 5 question ) collect visit 1 . The structured interview do visit 4 7 , take 10-15 minute occasion . There 5 question group , additional 5 question intervention group . Structured response enter pre-coded scoring sheet . Free text responses audio-recorded . Safety report baseline 26 week follow visit . Adverse event may record participant use trial telephone number , email , via text message service smart phone app . Participants directly ask adverse event study visit . All serious adverse event , whether 'expected ' 'unexpected ' , need report . All serious adverse event ( SAE ) information record Primary Care Clinical Trials Unit ( PC-CTU ) SAE report form site Chief Investigator ( CI ) fax PC-CTU dedicate fax line . SAEs report PC-CTU soon possible , preferably within 24 hour . The PC-CTU perform initial check report , request additional information reporting clinician ensure CI safety delegator review evaluate report expectedness relatedness . All SAE report also review routinely Independent Safety Review Committee . All SAEs follow resolution end study period . A SAE occur participant report REC Sponsor opinion Chief Investigator event 'related ' ( resulted administration research procedure ) 'unexpected ' relation procedure . Reports relate unexpected SAEs submit within 15 work day CI become aware event . A formal sample size calculation require pilot study . The analysis carry basis intention-to-treat . The analysis pilot study primarily descriptive include hypothesis test presentation P-values group comparison . Continuous variable report mean standard deviation ( median Interquartile range skew ) . Categorical variable report count percentage . Differences group calculate described 95 % confidence interval include significance test P-values . The delivery intervention involve patient home visit . To facilitate visit study team require access patient identifiable data . The consent clearly list data collect purpose . The identifiable data hold securely PC-CTU , separately trial data , access data restrict appropriate member study team identify delegation log . Identifiable data anonymised soon longer require .
