	<brief_summary>This efficacy study evaluate safety effectiveness aspirin venous leg ulcer heal . The study also examine whether patient recruit large study . Patients chronic venous leg ulceration present undergo care leg ulcer community clinic hospital out-patient clinic , register clinic receiving care home recruit . All patient receive standard compression bandaging . Half participant randomise receive aspirin , half receive placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aspirin Venous Ulcers : Randomised Trial ( AVURT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mainstay treatment leg ulcer grade compression therapy squeeze fluid leg venous system . This show effective many clinical trial . However , despite treatment patient take many month heal ( median healing time approximately 12 week previous trial ) patient compression therapy result resolution leg ulcer . The use compression ( well dress largely manage wound exudate ) expensive nurse time require change bandage require weekly frequently . Furthermore , many patient compression therapy uncomfortable ( sometimes painful ) inconvenient everyday life ( compression bulky dressing change several time weekly ) . If treatment able reduce time heal would significant breakthrough . Results two early small trial suggest aspirin may benefit . However trial poorly design report . The present study evaluate whether addition 300mg daily aspirin standard evidence base therapy reduces time heal chronic venous leg ulceration use rigorous design . The study also establish feasibility satisfactory participant recruitment big trial , whether participant compliant aspirin therapy . The safety aspirin patient population also monitor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Those least one chronic venous leg ulcer chronic venous leg ulceration define break skin either : ) present six week , b ) occur person history venous leg ulceration . Ulcers consider purely venous clinically etiology suspect . For ulcer must venous appearance ( i.e . moist , shallow , irregular shape ) lie wholly partially within gaiter region leg . If patient one ulcer choose large ulcer 'index ' lesion purpose analysis . Ulcer area &gt; 1 square cm Participants must ankle brachial pressure index ( ABPI ) ≥ 0.8 take within previous three month . When ABPI incompressible form assessment include peripheral pulse examination / toe pressure / duplex ultrasound combination clinical judgement use exclude PAD Aged ≥ 18 year ( upper age limit ) Able willing provide inform consent Ulcer duration &gt; 6 week prior history venous ulceration . Unable provide consent Unwilling provide consent Foot ( ankle ) ulcer A leg ulcer nonvenous aetiology ( i.e . arterial ) Anklebrachial pressure index ( ABPI ) &lt; 0.8 Current regular use aspirin ( may randomise placebo ) Previous intolerance aspirin / contraindication aspirin ( decision make accord prescribers ' clinical judgement ) Prohibited medication : Probenecid Known lactose intolerance ( placebo contains lactose ) Pregnant/lactating woman Currently participate another study evaluate leg ulcer therapy . Another reason exclude participate within trial ( decision make accord nurse ' prescribers ' clinical judgment ) * Previously recruit trial .</criteria>
