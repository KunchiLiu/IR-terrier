	<brief_summary>Frailty highly prevalent condition , reach approximately 7 % 30 % old adult age 65 80 year [ 2 ] . Although exercise seem beneficial frail elder , still insufficient evidence indicate appropriate modality , frequency intensity physical exercise able improve physical function population [ 9 ] . The virtual reality ( VR ) use interactive game ( exergames ) generate broad scientific clinical interest recent year [ 10 ] . Studies indicate old adult benefit train exergames improve mobility [ 12 , 13 ] , low limb strength [ 14 ] , cognition , particularly executive function [ 13 ] , body balance [ 10 , 15-18 ] , reaction time [ 12 ] may contribute indirectly prevent fall [ 10 , 19 , 20 ] . But , still insufficient evidence suggest use exergames superior even type intervention [ 21-23 ] combination conventional physiotherapy [ 24 ] The purpose study investigate effectiveness add exercise use interactive videogames ( exergames ) improve physical functioning frail pre frail old people compare conventional physiotherapy . A parallel randomized clinical 6 month follow-up period conduct 82 frail community dwell old adult . Participants randomize Experimental Group submit 30 minute conventional physiotherapy 20 minute therapy use interactive game Xbox 360 Video Game Entertainment Microsoft System Kinect sensor . The Control Group receive 50 minute conventional physiotherapy . Both group receive 50 minute intervention twice week 12 week . Primary outcome assess Short Physical Performance Battery , Usual walk speed test Four Step Square Test baseline , 3 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Frailty consider biological geriatric syndrome , characterize decrease resistance stress functional reserve due cumulative decline multiple physiological system , consequent increase state vulnerability [ 2 ] . Negative health relate outcome , disability , recurrent hospitalization , institutionalization , fall mortality [ 2-4 ] associate frailty , consider emerge public health problem [ 2 , 5 ] . Physical exercise recommend intervention strategy prevention rehabilitation mobility-related outcome frail elderly whit positive impact functional capacity performance [ 8 ] . A functional downward spiral characterize impairment several functional domain , strength , muscular endurance motor-cognitive process , ultimately lead restrict mobility decrease physical activity level commonly observe frail old people . Interventions promote integration multisensory , cognitive motor skill able motivate old people remain active long period , despite limitation . Exergames involve task virtual environment combine physical cognitive demand attractive challenging way . The player encourage achieve goal overcome limit game , provide immediate feedback relation performance . The game experience create great sense self-efficacy generate positive perception personal skill , modulate positive environment reinforcement , consequently increase motivation engagement . This combination great sense self-efficacy great motivation could provide positive necessary influence old people overcome limitation create new lifestyle habit [ 25 ] , decrease disability . This study seek investigate effectiveness add exercise use interactive videogames ( exergames ) improve physical functioning frail pre frail old people compare conventional physiotherapy .</detailed_description>
