All municipality start trial simultaneously act control point time randomize crossover control intervention , municipality implement intervention end inclusion . The method consist two part ; 1 ) Identification barriers/facilitators + development model intervention , 2 ) Implementation new model ( interactive workshop ) process effect evaluation . Participants general practitioner physiotherapists primary care well people hip knee OA .</detailed_description>
