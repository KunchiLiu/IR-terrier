Yet , reason behind unclear . `` Resistant '' individual often high physical activity level ( PALs ) . It seem - high level physical activity therefore energy expenditure - satiety signal precisely regulate , make one good match energy intake expenditure . In word , active people may overeat sedentary people would . However , explain difference weight gain observed subject overeat ( imposed overfeeding ) . It could active people well able cope metabolically extra calorie already high level carbohydrate fat oxidation compare inactive counterpart . Objectives : 1/ To study effect overfeed ( normal diet composition ) substrate balance oxidation specifically fat balance oxidation ; 2/ study effect exercise train fat oxidation overfeed ( normal diet composition ) . Study design : This control intervention study follow cross-over design . Each subject spend 5 night 4 day respiration chamber two occasion , separate 10-week training period .</brief_summary>
