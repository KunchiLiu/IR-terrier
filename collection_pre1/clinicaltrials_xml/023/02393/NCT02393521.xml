	<detailed_description>Myofascial trigger point ( MTrPs ) common source ( regional ) pain patient present musculoskeletal pain . Mechanical vibration suggest treatment pain relief . In study , effect vibration therapy people non-specific neck pain MTrPs investigate . Seventeen chronic non-specific neck pain patient randomly assign treatment ( vibration group , n = 9 ) control group ( n = 8 ) . Vibration group receive 10 self-administered session vibration therapy ( 45-50 Hz 15 minute subject lay supine ) . Perceived neck pain disability pressure pain threshold MTrPs upper trapezius levator scapula bilateraly measure baseline first , five 10 treatment session .</detailed_description>
