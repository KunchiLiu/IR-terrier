	<brief_summary>Objective : To compare success rate biodentine partial pulpotomy versus formocresol pulpotomy treatment pulpally expose low primary molar . After caries removal result pulp exposure , pulp expose area amputate depth 2 mm . The wound surface irrigate dry . After homeostasis obtain , assistant draw lot randomly allocate case either biodentine partial pulpotomy ( PP ) formocresol pulpotomy ( FP ) group . The follow-up clinical radiographic evaluation carry 6-month interval .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Prospective - Study population : 100 patient . - Study group : This study sample comprise mandibular primary molar boys girl age 3 7 year . The child systemic disease accord medical history supply parent guardian . The mandibular primary molar study select accord follow clinical radiographic criterion . The clinical criterion : presence deep carious lesion , sufficient tooth structure restoration stainless steel crown , history spontaneous pain , tenderness percussion abnormal mobility , abscess , fistula , swell gingiva , cessation bleed 2 mm depth pulp area exposure amputate . The radiographic criterion : deep carious lesion close proximity pulp without furcation radicular pathology , obliteration pulp root canal , internal external root resorption . Physiologic root resorption , include criterion , could one-third root length . - Clinical technique : All teeth treat local anaesthesia rubber dam isolation . After caries removal result pulp exposure , pulp expose area amputate depth 2 mm use water-cooled high-speed handpiece # 330 high-speed bur . The wound surface irrigate sterile saline solution dry cotton pellet avoid clot formation . After homeostasis obtain , assistant draw lot randomly allocate case either PP FP treatment group . The child know treatment assign tooth . For PP group , biodentine gently apply wound surface , cover reinforced zinc oxide-eugenol ( IRM_ ; Dentsply ) . For FP group , coronal access obtain use high-speed handpiece # 330 high-speed bur water spray expose pulp chamber . Following removal coronal pulp achievement homeostasis , cotton pellet moisten formocresol ( 1 : 5 Buckley 's solution ) place amputate pulp 5 min . The pulp stump cover IRM . After PP FP treatment , teeth restore stainless steel crown . - Follow-up : follow-up clinical radiographic evaluation carry 6-month interval . Treatment consider clinical failure one following sign observe : pain , abscess sinus opening , tenderness upon percussion , abnormal tooth mobility . For radiographic evaluation , treatment rat failure one follow sign present : furcation periapical radiolucency , pathologic external root resorption , internal resorption . The treatment regard successful clinical radiographic evaluation indicate sign failure .</detailed_description>
