	<detailed_description>Eight plan dose level ODM-106 compare placebo.There 2 panel subject 4 dose level panel . Subjects randomise receive 3 dose level active treatment ( single dos ) 1 dose placebo . The dose level escalate small dose upwards within study within study subject . A third panel 8 subject may include investigate dose level ODM-106 , investigate effect take ODM-106 food compare two different formulation ODM-106 . For individual subject , study consist screen period ( maximum 4 week ) , 4 study treatment period wash-out period study treatment administration post-treatment period 2 week . The study duration individual approximately 12-16 week . Blood sample collect assessment concentration ODM-106 metabolite.Plasma sample cumulative urinary sample collect metabolite screening . Safety assess 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , continuous ECG monitoring , Holter ECG , supine orthostatic blood pressure heart rate , body temperature , physical examination , electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , laboratory safety assessment adverse event . Sedation psychomotor test quantitative EEG also perform .</detailed_description>
