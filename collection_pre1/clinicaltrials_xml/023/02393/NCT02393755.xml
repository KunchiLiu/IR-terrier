	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose nintedanib give together capecitabine see well work treat patient colorectal cancer respond previous treatment ( refractory ) spread place body ( metastatic ) . Nintedanib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It may also block growth new blood vessel necessary tumor growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving nintedanib capecitabine may better treatment colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) examine dose-limiting toxicity nintedanib administer capecitabine within study population , establish recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) . ( Phase I ) II . To assess progression free survival 18 week . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess median progression free survival . ( Phase II ) II . To assess median overall survival date enrollment time death document . ( Phase II ) III . To assess objective response rate measure Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version ( v ) 1.1 . ( Phase II ) IV . To assess toxicity dose regimen use Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE version 4.0 ) . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Measurement circulate angiogenic cytokine ( CAFs ) : vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( sVEGFR ) 1/2 , placental growth factor ( PlGF ) , granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GMCSF ) , leptin , interleukin ( IL ) -1 alpha ( ) , IL-8 , IL-6 , fibroblast growth factor basic ( FGFb ) , osteopontin pentraxin-3 . ( Phase II ) II . Measurement drug level pharmacokinetic ( PK ) /pharmacodynamic ( PD ) modeling . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study nintedanib follow phase II study . Patients receive capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) ( every 12 hour ) day 1-14 nintedanib PO BID ( every 12 hour ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 28 day resolution satisfactory stabilization persistent drug-related toxicity , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
