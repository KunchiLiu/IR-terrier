	<brief_summary>Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) life support system provide cardiac respiratory support patient heart respiratory failure . It save time organ recovery patient receive management . However , many patient die spite ECMO support . One key factor whether blood flow provide ECMO meet requirement organ perfusion . The adequacy macrocirculation may determine arterial pressure minute blood flow ECMO . However , adequacy microcirculation remain major unresolved clinical problem . This prospective observational clinical trial . The sublingual microcirculation examine incident dark field video microscope within 6 hour venoarterial ECMO placement , 24 h , 48 h , 72 h , 96 h. The severity multiple organ injury clinical data record well . The major parameter microcirculation include total small vessel density , perfuse small vessel density , microvascular flow index . The sublingual microcirculation also examine wean ECMO , within 6 hour ECMO removal , 24 h , 48 h , 72 h. Serum level endothelial cell specific molecule-1 specific time point examine . The data 14-day mortality , 28-day mortality , duration ECMO support , intensive care unit stay record . This study aim primarily investigate relationship microcirculation prognosis patient . This study also investigate relationship among serum level endothelial cell specific molecule-1 , microcirculation , prognosis patient . Wish result study applied research help improve quality ECMO care .</brief_summary>
