	<brief_title>Romidepsin Plus Cisplatin Locally Recurrent Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer ( TNBC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common cancer second lead cause cancer relate death American woman . Despite recent improvement treatment breast cancer , 40,000 woman per year still die U.S.as result breast cancer . Once disease gotten bad ( progress ) standard chemotherapy treatment , limited treatment option likelihood patient recover small . The purpose study determine high dose romidepsin combine cisplatin result serious side effect . The safety efficacy romidepsin combine cisplatin assess , along determination long drug combination keep disease get bad . The study do two phase : Phase I determine high dose romidepsin safe tolerable take combination cisplatin . Phase II determine take romidepsin ( dose determine Phase I ) combination cisplatin safe effective treating patient breast cancer . Phase I complete Phase II begin .</detailed_description>
