	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well iodine I-131works without selumetinib treat patient thyroid cancer return spread started place body . Many thyroid cancer absorb iodine . Because , doctor often give radioactive iodine ( iodine I-131 ) alone treat thyroid cancer part standard practice . It think thyroid tumor able absorb radioactive iodine , likely radioactive iodine cause tumor shrink . Selumetinib may help radioactive iodine work well patient whose tumor still absorb radioactive iodine . It yet know whether iodine I-131 effective without selumetinib treat thyroid cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iodine I-131 With Without Selumetinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate 6 month follow treatment 131I ( iodine I-131 ) combination placebo selumetinib radioactive iodine-avid ( RAIA ) recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine best overall response follow treatment 131I combination placebo selumetinib RAIA recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer . II . To compare progression-free survival patient RAIA recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer treat 131I combination placebo selumetinib . III . To compare serum thyroglobulin change patient RAIA recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer treat 131I combination placebo selumetinib . IV . To evaluate safety tolerability 131I combination placebo selumetinib patient RAI-avid recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore genomic transcriptomic landscape RAIA tumor signatures correlate therapeutic benefit achieve 131I combination placebo selumetinib . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive selumetinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) start week 1 , day 1 continue 2 day iodine I-131 therapy administer . Approximately 3 week begin treatment selumetinib , patient receive iodine I-131 PO . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO BID start week 1 , day 1 continue 2 day iodine I-131 therapy administer . Approximately 3 week begin treatment placebo , patient receive iodine I-131 PO . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 3 month , every 3 month 12 month , every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
