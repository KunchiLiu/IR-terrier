	<brief_summary>In study , investigator evaluate impact red blood cell age patient receive chronic blood transfusion outpatient set . This study double-bind , randomize trial design , mean investigator participant tell group assignment study enrollment . Study participant randomly divide two group ( 50 % participant group ) computer generate block randomization schema . The 'fresh blood ' group receive blood unit 7 less time donor collection , 'aged blood ' group receive blood unit great 21 42 day time donor collection . The number unit blood transfuse decide base participant 's hemoglobin level blood transfusion . The primary goal study compare annual red blood cell product use ( number unit give per patient year ) . The investigator also compare group evaluate transfusion reaction frequency , iron burden ( base level ferritin blood ) , overall transfusion care cost difference , participant time spend outpatient department . Our hypothesis use fresh blood chronically transfuse patient lead decrease red cell transfusion rate , subsequent clinical benefit include reduction transfusion reaction frequency systemic iron burden . This study take place within Calgary Zone Alberta Health Services .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Red Cell Age Product Utilization Chronically Transfused Outpatient Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Chronically transfuse medical outpatient comprise significant proportion transfusion recipient annually . At time , impact red cell transfusion patient outcomes patient population unknown . Objective : Our goal prospectively evaluate impact red cell age product utilization cohort chronically transfuse medical outpatient randomize receive red blood cell fresh ( ≤ 7 day collection ) age ( &gt; 21-42 day collection ) . To knowledge , study similar design objective publish . Patient population study design : Patients meet eligibility criterion invite participate study . Our chronically transfuse outpatient population define adult receive 2 red cell unit per month least 3 consecutive month ambulatory clinic setting within Calgary Zone . We plan incorporate prospective retrospective data collection analysis study design . All eligible , consent participant randomize one two study arm . Investigators participant blind participant group assignment . Laboratory parameter red cell transfusion : Parameters usual pre-transfusion bloodwork follow , include complete blood count ( CBC ) ferritin level . Red cell transfusion volumes chronic transfusion throughout study determine accord locally establish protocol achieve post-transfusion hemoglobin ( Hb ) 95-105 g/dL . Given 1 adult unit red cell raise baseline Hb approximately 10 g/L , follow volume give patient single visit base pre-transfusion CBC : Hb &lt; 75 = 3 unit , Hb 75-84 = 2 unit , Hb 85-94 = 1 unit , Hb ≥95 = transfusion . A routine post-transfusion CBC perform . According usual care , participant stand order perform CBC least weekly , subjective symptom anemia help guide subsequent transfusion . Study participant receive blood transfusion usual location designate within Calgary Zone administration chronic blood transfusion . These include medical daycare unit Foothills Medical Center , Tom Baker Cancer Center , Peter Lougheed Center , South Health Campus . Nurses administer blood transfusion accord standard practice , without change transfusion protocol despite patient study participation . Duration participation 1 year time enrollment . Participant health record access require collection demographic information retrospective data involve transfusion receive within 1 year prior enrollment establish transfusion chronicity health pattern . Outcomes base comparison result study group . Prospectively collect data base red cell age additionally compare retrospective transfusion relate information ( include red cell transfusion frequency blood age ) within 1 year time enrollment , available . We plan enroll maximum total 60 participant , assignment 30 patient group .</detailed_description>
