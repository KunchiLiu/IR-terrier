	<brief_title>Functional Movement-power Training Children With Developmental Coordination Disorder : A Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With grow number child dyspraxia Hong Kong , focus paediatric rehabilitation service shift severe motor disorder ( e.g. , cerebral palsy ) relatively minor motor problem developmental coordination disorder ( DCD ) . Evidence-based treatment strategy must develop suit change need . Children diagnose DCD characterise marked impairment motor function . Poor balance ability major concern may predispose child fall affect motor skill development . At present , rehabilitation regime DCD-affected child use functional movement training ( FMT ) induce neural plastic change central nervous system ( CNS ) thus enhance functional ( balance ) performance . Less emphasis place treat neuromuscular impairment might also affect functional outcome . Recently , investigator research team discover slow hamstring muscle force production , neuromuscular deficit , may one cause poor balance strategy child DCD , effective treatment strategy yet examine . Power training ( PT ) find effective increase speed muscle force production balance adult various neuromuscular mechanism . In study , investigator intend treat CNS peripheral neuromuscular deficit DCD-affected child . Therefore , investigator incorporate PT conventional FMT regime . The investigator hypothesise balance strategy functional performance child DCD improve treat CNS neuromuscular deficit . This hypothesis support find PT FMT superior FMT alone improve balance strategy functional performance child DCD . Objective : To compare effectiveness PT-FMT , FMT alone intervention improve balance strategy performance among child DCD . Design : A randomise controlled clinical trial . Sample : 87 child DCD . Interventions : 12 week PT FMT FMT alone two intervention group . Major outcome : Sensory organisation test - balance strategy composite score ; Movement Assessment Battery Children - total impairment score balance subscore ; hand-held dynamometer measurement low limb muscle strength time peak force . Anticipated result clinical significance : DCD-affected child receive FMT together PT best balance performance outcomes . If result positive , train programme could readily transferrable clinical practice . This could positive socio-economic implication , short treatment period reduce healthcare cost .</detailed_description>
