	<brief_title>Docetaxel With Without MLN1117 Participants With Locally Advanced Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug evaluate study call MLN1117 . MLN1117 test combination docetaxel versus docetaxel alone treatment non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . This study consist 2 phase : - Phase 1b - dose escalation phase - Phase 2 - expansion phase . Approximately 15 patient NSCLC treat multiple prior line therapy enrol Phase 1b . The participant receive docetaxel ( 36 mg/m2 ) intravenous ( IV ) MLN1117 tablet , orally administer , daily 21-day dosing cycle . The MLN117 dose escalate recommended Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) determine . Up 140 adult locally advance metastatic NSCLC refractory resistant 1 prior line platinum-based , non-docetaxel contain systemic chemotherapy previously fail 1 second line therapy immune-checkpoint inhibitor enrol Phase 2 ( dose expansion ) . Phase 2 expansion study use sequential , multistage Bayesian adaptive design consist 3 part evaluate follow patient population : - Part 1 : NSCLC ( inclusive squamous nonsquamous histology PIK3CA genotype ) - Part 2 : Histology-specific NSCLC ( either squamous nonsquamous ) - Part 3 : Histology- genotype-specific NSCLC ( PIK3CA MUT/AMP positive squamous NSCLC squamous histology select Part 2 ) Each part adaptive Phase 2 portion study design stand-alone , randomize study evaluate PFS primary efficacy measure total 60 patient 2 treatment arm : MLN1117 plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone . An event-driven analysis PFS perform part Phase 2 . On basis PFS analysis precede part study , study may stop efficacy futility , proceed next part . Study drug administer 21-day dosing cycle . During phase study , patient treat maximum 9 cycle either docetaxel alone docetaxel plus MLN1117 . Subsequently , pPatients treat docetaxel plus MLN1117 may continue receive MLN1117 monotherapy progression disease , occurrence unacceptable toxicity death . The maximum duration treatment patient 12 month unless determine patient would derive benefit continued treatment beyond 12 month . Patients continue follow discontinuation study drug collect PFS OS data . Patients may withdraw therapy time . This multicenter trial conduct North America Europe . The overall time participate study 24 month .</detailed_description>
