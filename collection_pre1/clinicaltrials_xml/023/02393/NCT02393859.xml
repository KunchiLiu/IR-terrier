	<brief_summary>B-precursor ALL aggressive malignant disease . Therapy usually stratify accord risk characteristic ensure appropriate treatment administer patient high-risk relapse . In general , pediatric treatment regimen intense employed adult include course combination chemotherapy . Standard care chemotherapy associate considerable toxicity . There lack novel treatment option subject relapse refractory treatment . Therefore , innovative therapeutic approach urgently need . Blinatumomab bispecific single-chain antibody construct design link B cell T cell result T cell activation cytotoxic T cell response CD19 express cell . This study evaluate event-free survival ( EFS ) treatment blinatumomab compare standard care ( SOC ) chemotherapy . The effect blinatumomab overall survival reduction minimal residual disease compare SOC chemotherapy also investigate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Trial Blinatumomab v Standard Chemotherapy Pediatric Subjects With HR First Relapse B-precursor ALL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients enrol initial phase study randomize 1:1 ratio receive either one cycle blinatumomab one block standard high-risk consolidation chemotherapy . Blinatumomab administer continuous intravenous infusion ( CIVI ) . One cycle blinatumomab treatment include 4 week CIVI blinatumomab . An interim analysis perform data monitoring committee provide recommendation either continue original study design , adapt treatment arm randomize subsequent patient either three cycle blinatumomab three block high-risk consolidation chemotherapy . After complete consolidation therapy , patient undergo alloHSCT depend bone marrow status . THe patient follow 36 month alloHSCT .</detailed_description>
