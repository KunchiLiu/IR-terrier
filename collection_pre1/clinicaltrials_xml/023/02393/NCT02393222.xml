	<brief_summary>Stroke disease cognitive impairment common patient establish haemodialysis ( HD ) end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Further , initiation HD appear transiently increase risk stroke . The mechanism occur know . Using ultrasound , patient questionnaire brain MRI study observe change cognition cerebral blood flow whilst receive HD compare non-dialysis day . Transient clinical ultrasound alteration correlate radiographic change cerebral perfusion structure MRI determine underlie mechanism increase stroke risk . The investigator observe effect immediate long term ( 12 month observation ) . A great understanding allow development effective preventive strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke common United Kingdom lead cause adult disability . It report half stroke survivor remain dependent carers everyday activity . A great understanding stroke disease lead improvement stroke care general population . Patients ESRD increase risk cerebrovascular disease risk approximately 5-10 time higher general population yet relative paucity data explore mechanisms impact stroke disease patient HD remain . Signs cerebrovascular disease common evidence early stroke disease ( white matter hyperintensities MRI ) describe 50 % ESRD patient . In addition estimate 70 % patient dialysis age 55 year old moderate severe cognitive impairment . Previous work reveal cognition decline dialysis - specifically decrease executive function report , without significant memory impairment . Such finding suggestive vascular related injury . Mean cerebral blood flow assess transcranial Doppler ultrasound reduce dialysis , although whether find associated clinical outcome clear . In order generate appropriate preventive strategy stroke ESRD mechanism injury occur must confirm . In addition , although decrease executive function show HD unclear long-term HD associate progressive decline clinical finding correlate neuroimaging . This study perform determine : - The impact long term HD ( include index cardiovascular instability ) change brain MRI cognitive function . - The relationship intracerebral blood flow rate , brain MRI finding neurocognitive function - The relationship intracranial blood flow measure ( post haemodialysis ( HD ) ) brain perfusion structure Following informed write consent patient observe 12 month period . On first visit participant undergo transcranial ultrasound HD achieve baseline intra-dialytic blood flow velocity . During dialysis session neurocognitive assessment ( patient questionnaire ) perform assess multiple cognitive domain . On completion dialysis subgroup undergo brain MRI . All patient meet investigator within 2 week repeat neurocognitive assessment non-dialysis day . This allow comparison cognitive change , alteration cerebral blood flow ( ) correlation MRI finding . All participant repeat process 12 month later .</detailed_description>
