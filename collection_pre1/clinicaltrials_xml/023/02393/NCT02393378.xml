	<brief_title>Namilumab v Adalimumab Participants With Moderate Severe Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Inadequately Responding Methotrexate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug investigate study Namilumab treatment moderate severe Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) . This study evaluate efficacy safety namilumab participant diagnose RA within 6 month entry study . The study enroll approximately 36 participant , randomly assign 2:1 ratio follow open label treatment group : - Namilumab 300 mg subcutaneous ( SC ) administer Week 0 follow thereafter 150 mg SC administer Weeks 2 22 ( interval specify protocol ) add-on weekly exist stable methotrexate ( MTX ) folic acid : 24 subject . - Active control , adalimumab 40 mg SC administer Weeks 0 22 ( interval specify protocol ) add-on weekly exist stable MTX folic acid : 12 participant . Sensitive image technique , include Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( DCE-MRI ) , use measure change dominant hand wrist . This multi-center trial conduct Europe . The overall time participate study maximum 44 week , include follow-up period . Participants make 16 visit site follow telephone twice end treatment .</detailed_description>
