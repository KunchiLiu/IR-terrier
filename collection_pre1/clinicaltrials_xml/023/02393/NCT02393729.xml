	<brief_summary>All study underline high frequency co-morbid association specific learn disorder . Understanding reason association could enable u determine cerebral base underlie disorder . Their frequent association suggest etiological base partly common , seem logical turn explanatory model various common specific disorder . The model recently propose Nicholson &amp; Fawcett ( 2007 ) suggest specific disorder procedural learning . But brain network involve learning could achieve separately . We intend therefore study neural network involve learning procedural compare network recruit among child specific learn disorder alone combination ( co-morbidity ) . The child include study either Developmental Dyslexia Developmental Coordination Disorder , . The procedure include neuropsychological evaluation brain MRI study morphological functional part . During fMRI child realizes automate motor task contrast task involve learn procedural .</brief_summary>
