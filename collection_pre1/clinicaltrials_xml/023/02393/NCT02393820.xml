	<brief_title>Phase II Study Pazopanib Patients With Progressive Recurrent and/or Metastatic Salivary Gland Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In non-ACC SGCHN population , assessment activity pazopanib exploratory without predetermine study design , 20 patient . A planned interim analysis acute toxicity conduct 3 month 14th non-ACC inclusion . ACC As endpoint evaluate 6 month treatment start , one-stage phase II study design choose . The unacceptable 6-month rate progression free survival 20 % promising 6-month rate progression free survival 40 % . 43 patient treat . If ≤12 patient alive without progression 6 month observe , drug declare ineffective . If ≥13 patient alive without progression 6 month observe , drug declare promising . The α error rate ( accept poor treatment ) 0.07 β error rate ( reject promise treatment ) 0.07 . Analysis result separate non ACC ACC .</detailed_description>
