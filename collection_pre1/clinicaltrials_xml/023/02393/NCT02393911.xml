	<brief_title>Dysbiosis Localized Provoked Vulvodynia ( LPV )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vulvodynia - vulvar pain . The exact etiology elucidate yet , therapy often unsatisfactory . Two main type Vulvodynia exist , far common type Localized provoke vulvodynia ( LPV ) , also know Vestibulodynia , past - Vestibulitis . This study concentrate common disorder affect young woman , whose quality life deteriorate significantly inability experience vaginal sex . The vaginal microbiome The new field microbiome research focus composition overall microorganism human body impact human health . Amazingly , number microbial cell within body 10 time great sum human somatic germ cell , carry 150 time genetic information . Changes composition vaginal microbiota ( dysbiosis ) link different health disease state . The vagina colonize around 108-109 bacteria/mL vaginal fluid comparable small intestine . Recently , NIH Human Microbiome Project characterize bacterial community across human body find vagina harbor low complexity bacterial community . These community lowest alpha diversity ( within sample diversity ) among different body site low beta diversity ( sample diversity ) genus level . This diversity high specie level due distinct Lactobacillus spp . The community sample sub site include posterior fornix , mid vagina vaginal introitus . There little distinction three site hence focus posterior fornix . The vaginal community healthy woman , also repeatedly observe occupy one five state , four dominate Lactobacillus spp . one high overall microbial diversity . Shifts community structure within individual ( dysbiosis ) associate disease state would interest study whether woman LPV belong different enterotype healthy woman . The vaginal microbial community show change different stage woman 's life influence pregnancy . As early 1930 , Cruickshank Baird describe change vaginal bacterial community occur 5th 7th month pregnancy . In 2010 study undertake among Amerindian woman examine microbial vaginal signature term relation delivery mode ( n=9 ) . Variability vaginal taxon note subject particularly Lactobacillus specie . Metagenomic analysis vaginal microbiome cross-sectional study 24 healthy pregnant woman 60 non-pregnant control three vaginal site ( introitus , posterior fornix midvagina ) find richness diversity vaginal microbiome reduce pregnancy way appear drive BMI , race ethnicity . As pregnancy progress proximity uterus increase , less diversity richness note . Lactobacillus specie enrich pregnancy , author postulate may biologically significant lactic acid bacteria produce bacteriocins may reduce risk ascend infection . It also propose vaginal microbiota potential influence conception process influence local production proinflammatory cytokine turn impact survival rate motility sperm cell . The vaginal microbiome Vulvodynia Several microorganism discuss presumed role LPV development : LPV frequently associate precede chronic recurrent candidiasis , LPV may produce mouse model repeat vulvovaginal fungal infection , difficulty treat woman concomitant LPV candidiasis ( complicate LPV ) , report beneficial effect treatment combine antibiotic , aim eradicate H. pylorus peptic condition ( although H. pylorus detect LPV tissue ) . Indirect evidence role microbiome development LPV may deduce beneficial effect ( 14.3 - 50 % ) , report author , diet avoid oxalate rich Calcium citrate , LPV . As woman LPV consume oxalate - although significantly , suspect variability response rate may due indirect effect diet - change microbiome , may affect LPV severity . In addition , adverse effect oral contraceptive pill ( OCP ) increase LPV symptom ; OCP tend change composition vaginal microbiota , consequent effect thin dehydrate vaginal mucosa . These find prompt u inquire possible association vaginal microbiome dysbiosis development LPV . Objective : The propose study first compare vaginal microbiome woman severe LPV , treat diet otherwise healthy , woman without LPV ( also compare result NIH HMP data ) . At second stage characterize effect three-month low oxalate diet vaginal microbiota woman LPV outcome compare group patient LPV treat diet . Vaginal pH date menstrual cycle check . We propose dysbiosis vaginal microbiota may trigger development LPV . Vulvodynia subtype : - The research study woman localize provoke Vulvodynia - Only secondary type LPV include . - LPV diagnosis base document first two Friedrich 's criterion vulva vestibulits syndrome : patient 's complaint entry dyspareunia , positive Q-tip test . - Only woman suffer level II III dyspareunia accord Marinoff : Level II pain prevents intercourse take place occasion ; Level III pain result total apareunia . Methods/Protocol This double blind , prospective study compare microbiome woman severe LPV woman without LPV , compare effect consume low oxalate diet calcium citrate supplement one month microbiome woman LPV . The local Institutional Review Board approval request . Every woman participate study sign inform consent prior enrollment . Study group The study group consist 35 woman : - Meeting first two Friedrich 's criterion vulva vestibulitis syndrome - Diagnosed gynecological examination Localized Provoked Vulvodynia - Diagnosed Level II III degree syndrome accord Marinoff Control group - The control group consist 35 consecutive woman refer department co-investigators . Presentation LPV exclusion criterion . Materials Methods : Prior enrollment , woman question possible inclusion exclusion criterion , fill ISSVD Vulvodynia questionnaire . Women find suitable study undergo Q-tip test confirm diagnosis Vestibulodynia . Women LPV group instruct consume `` low oxalate diet '' calcium citrate supplement , recommend Solomons et al duration least one month , assess impact vaginal microbiome . Clinical pain score vulvar sensitivity Q-tip test repeat one month compare clinical pain score begin study . Subjective evaluation carry compare personal data questionnaire fill enrollment one month later . Clinical evaluation perform experienced vulvar expert , use pain intensity scale ( The 11 point ( 0-10 ) pain intensity numerical rating scale-PI-NRS ) , seven focus throughout vestibule ( Q-tip test ) compare patient ' response questionnaire evaluate pain intercourse activity ( rid bicycle/horse ) , diet .</detailed_description>
