The sample size calculation perform accord primary endpoint study . All individual involve project sign term inform consent answer questionnaire personal health , contain demographic information , exposure radiation drug , well eat habit consumption alcohol cigarette . Methodological procedures The methodological step study consist : 1 . Selection subject accord criterion inclusion exclusion ; 2 . As outpatient treatment without Pulmonary Rehabilitation ( PR ) ass lung volume , respiratory muscle strength , dyspnea Medical Research Council ( MRC ) , functional capacity Functional Independence Measurement ( MIF ) Six Minutes Walk Test ( 6MWT ) , grip strength , Quality Life ( QoL ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , ankle-brachial index ( ITB ) ; 4 ) As submission Rehabilitation Pulmonary 02 month treatment ass lung volume , respiratory muscle strength , MRC , functional capacity ( MIF 6MWT ) , grip strength , QoL , BMI , ITB ; 5 ) As submission Rehabilitation Pulmonary 12 month treatment ass lung volume , respiratory muscle strength , MRC , functional capacity ( MIF 6MWT ) , grip strength , QoL , BMI , ITB Techniques tool collect Lung volume Lung volume assess digital spirometry ( EasyOne ® , Model 2001 , Zurich , Switzerland ) . It tool provide record several volume airflows individual able mobilize , gold standard assessment pulmonary function accord International Guidelines Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD , 2011 ) . Forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , force expiratory flow 25 % 75 % FVC ( FEF 25 % -75 % ) , FEV/FVC relationship , ( In present study , follow variable evaluate FEV1 / FVC ) peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) ( GONTIJO , 2011 ) . Three measure curve present best performance compare predict value literature describe percentage predict realize ( Pereira et al. , 1992 ) . Respiratory Muscle Strength ( FMR ) The FMR ( MIP MEP ) evaluate digital manometer ( MDI® , Porto Alegre , Brazil ) . The MIP obtain individual expiration residual volume ( RV ) , examiner connect nose clip request inspiration total lung capacity ( TLC ) . The MEP evaluate Total Lung Capacity inspiration residual volume mouthpiece ( ATS , 2002 ) . For data analysis , consider high value among five maneuver , differ 10 % second high value descend order . These value compare report literature ( NEDER et al. , 1999 ) express percentage predict . It noteworthy measure , patient remain sit position chair sit bed inclination 45 ° . Functional dyspnea The MRC ( Medical Research Council ) , British medical institute , develop scale graduate dyspnea patient COPD . The MRC scale use decade adapt Portuguese publish publish II Brazilian Consensus COPD ( 2004 ) . Patients originally categorize five grade , range 1 ( `` normal '' ) 5 ( `` dyspneic leave house '' ) . The scale focus primarily dyspnoea occur walk . The MRC scale widely use patient COPD due simplicity , ease use correlation quality life prognosis . Functional Capacity Functional capacity independence individual accomplish mental physical activity maintain basic instrumental activity . The Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) assessment tool people rehabilitation process , part Uniform Data System Medical Rehabilitation ( SUDRM ) widely use accept internationally measure functional assessment . Is link mobility functional capacity individual require help perform , ie , independence suppose satisfactory performance motor cognitive task condition . The use scale focus effective realization activity independently daily routine . So let document sensitivity functional acquisition correlation functional level . The degree dependence classify accord functional independence measure . This instrument consist six dimension : self-care , sphincter control , transfer , locomotion , communication social cognition . Each item score 1 ( total dependence ) 7 ( complete independence ) . Obtain minimum total score 18 maximum 126 point characterize level dependence . Through individual score classify follow : mild disability ( &gt; 80 point ) , moderate disability ( 40-80 point ) severe disability ( &lt; 40 ) . To perform 6MWT standard protocol use ATS Six-Minute Walk Test ( 2002 ) . The 6MWT hold , 02 test , practice test educational purpose another 6MWT , validate collect information distance walk six minute do . Standard phrase encouragement give examiner necessary , subject receive test , supplemental oxygen ( O2 ) maintain peripheral O2 saturation 90 % . Dynamometry Manual Evaluation peripheral muscle strength Dynamometry Manual ( DM ) appear simple , objective , low cost alternative less invasive measure maximal voluntary handgrip strength principle estimate function skeletal muscle . The dynamometer device simple use , provide fast direct reading . This test enable indicate health risk related muscle strength correlate skeletal muscle human body , consider good indicator overall muscle strength also assess physical performance several clinical situation . Conform American Society Hand Therapist ( ASHT ) , measure handgrip , patient seat comfortably adduct neutrally rotate , elbow flexed 90 ° , arm neutral pronation-supination shoulder wrist joint 0 ° 30 ° extension . The procedure perform three time limbs ( right left ) average measurement hemibody calculate separately give rest time 60 second ume measurement another quote . Quality Life ( QOL ) The questionnaire St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) specific assessment QoL patient COPD use . This questionnaire consist 76 item divide 03 domain ( symptom , activity impact disease ) . For domain , item cod transformed scale zero ( bad QOL ) 100 point ( best QoL ) , accord standardization Manual . Anthropometric Assessment The widely use anthropometric measurement ass nutritional status : weight , height , circumference ( arm waist ) , arm length skinfold thickness ( triceps , biceps , subscapular , suprailiac ) . Through combination measure possible calculate weight / height , arm muscle circumference arm fat index relationship . Anthropometric measurement easy perform relatively sensitive evaluate adult patient hospitalize isolation malnutrition . The body mass index ( BMI ) , express relationship body mass kg height m2 , widely use indicator nutritional status good correlation body mass low correlation height . Ankle-Brachial Index ( ABI ) The ABI noninvasive measurement peripheral arterial disease highly predictive subsequent cardiovascular morbidity mortality hypertensive patient . It relationship ( maximum ) ankle systolic blood pressure ( right left ) ( maximum ) arm systolic blood pressure ( right left ) patient rest take reference large value observe among measure side . Gauging ( maximum ) systolic blood pressure lower limb take ankle perform use Doppler Vascular Portable upper limb sphygmomanometer . It note ankle pressure generally high , ratio 1 1.1 normal . It noteworthy low index 0.9 provide strong evidence peripheral arterial disease , thus low value , severe disease , reduction due presence arterial obstruction lower limb . This index strongly associate incidence strongly relate individual 's functional capacity Arterial Chronic Disease . Waist-Hip Ratio ( WHR ) To obtain WHR , waist measure narrow part waist , last rib iliac crest hip circumference take wide area hips large protuberance buttock . Then divide waist measurement hip measurement . WHO define index &gt; 9.0 men &gt; 8.5 woman crucial relationship metabolic syndrome . Studies confirm cite several study show WHR superior predict all-cause cardiovascular disease mortality clinical measure . Another Study add hip circumference indicate low risk body fat accumulation thus include waist-hip ratio equation improve accuracy measurement technique . Lactate analysis In conjunction 6MWT , measure capillary lactate could estimate muscle metabolism profile COPD patient , since early increase physical exertion seem associate change muscle metabolism , observable loss oxidative activity skeletal muscle . The measurement perform obtain drop capillary blood tip second finger nondominant hand analysis lactate rest 6MWT , pre-Rehabilitation Pulmonary interval , 02 , 12 month post-Rehabilitation Pulmonary , ( Lct ) lactate analyzer Accutrend Plus . Intervention procedures The group patient undergo Rehabilitation Pulmonary carry intervention protocol recommend GOLD ( 2009 ) . Will undergo submaximal aerobic train 30-40 minute strength train upper low limb , muscle stretching , nutritional pharmacological monitoring continue education session , twice week . Such measure carry Hospital Santa Cruz , Santa Cruz Sul - Rio Grande Sul .</detailed_description>
