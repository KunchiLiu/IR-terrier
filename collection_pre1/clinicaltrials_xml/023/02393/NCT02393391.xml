	<brief_summary>Neuropathic pain result damage dysfunction peripheral central nervous system , rather stimulation pain receptor . Diagnosis suggest pain proportion tissue injury , dysesthesia ( eg , burning , tingle ) , sign nerve injury detect neurologic examination . Although neuropathic pain responds opioids , treatment often adjuvant drug ( eg , antidepressant , anticonvulsant , baclofen , topical drug ) . Neuropathic pain ( e.g . phantom limb pain , CRPS , postherpetic neuralgia , postsurgical pain syndrome , CLBP etc . ) remain challenging condition treat commonly refractory classical pharmacological surgical treatment approach . Chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) widespread costly problem intervention effective . An increased focus study nervous system involvement pain disorder document complex neuronal activity structural change peripheral , well spinal cord cortical level indicate neuropathic element CLBP . Accumulated evidence suggest neuropathic pain general CLBP specifically might associate brain cortical plastic change . Thus ideal rehabilitative approach aim reverse . In line idea , investigator suggest innovative noninvasive intervention aim alleviate neuropathic pain . New rehabilitative approach propose try reverse cortical reorganization . Results several study show motor cortex stimulation epidural electrode repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) transcranial direct stimulation ( tDCS ) effective reduce pain patient central pain refractory treatment . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) easily apply safe technique brain activity modulate noninvasively decrease pain patient refractory central pain . The investigator hypothesize focal-tDCS treatment personally customized patient basal neuronal network property would result acute long term pain relief neuropathic pain patient .</brief_summary>
