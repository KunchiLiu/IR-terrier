	<brief_summary>Rationale : About 80 % stroke patient suffer motor impairment , current therapy limit effect motor recovery . Therefore , investigate new potential therapeutic approach crucial . Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) form non-invasive electrical stimulation weak current apply electrode scalp . This stimulation know ( 1 ) induce change neuronal excitability -which last one day late LTP-like plasticity protocol polarity site-specific manner , ( 2 ) facilitate motor learn stroke recovery . So far , several pilot study report beneficial result tDCS subacute chronic stroke patient , 's still unclear tDCS repeat multiple day optimally enhance recovery training effect . Using late LTP-like plasticity protocol could increase effectiveness standard clinical care rehabilitation session thus enhance effect rehabilitation . Therefore , investigator want investigate late LTP-like plasticity tDCS affect rehabilitation subacute stroke patient . The outcome study provide important guideline effective motor therapy stroke rehabilitation . Objective : Identify effect late LTP-like plasticity motor rehabilitation subacute phase stroke . Study design : Double-blinded , randomized between-subjects trial . Study population : Subacute stroke patient . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary outcome measure upper limb motor function subacute phase stroke .</brief_summary>
