	<brief_summary>Hepatitis C cause hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) cause inflammation liver lead diminish liver function liver failure . The number chronically infected person worldwide estimate 170 million 2.35 % world population . Most people infected hepatitis C virus symptom disease advance stage liver disease occur , may take several year . The long-term impact HCV infection highly variable , minimal change extensive fibrosis cirrhosis without hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . Advanced liver disease ( ALD ) lead significant clinical economic consequence , include liver transplantation . HCV reduce life expectancy impair quality life . HCV-related complication well highly debilitate effect patient represent significant item expenditure National Health Service . Because latency infection , numerous country-specific population analyse suggest HCV cause increase number liver-related death despite dramatic drop incidence prevalence . These death relate prevalent HCV infection especially World War II indiscreet widespread treatment intravenous injection use contaminate syrinx , needle remunerate blood donor . Eradicating HCV infection prevent complication HCV-related liver extrahepatic disease , include liver necroinflammation , fibrosis , cirrhosis , HCC , death . Newly discover hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) therapy direct act antiviral agent ( DAA ) like Simeprevir , sofosbuvir open new chapter treatment chronic hepatitis C. Those new treatment regimen promise oral dosing , high SVR , short duration treatment few side effect . In near future patient qualify future all-oral therapy . However recent analysis show increase efficacy treatment alone able reduce HCV disease burden . The large reduction HCV-related morbidity mortality obtain high efficacy therapy combine increased diagnosis treatment rate . With treatment rate 10 % possible achieve &gt; 90 % decline total infection 2030 . This would require 3-5 fold increase diagnosis and/or treatment country . The implementation screen criterion hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) target birth cohort potential effect reduce progression hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) advance liver disease ( ALD ) could avoid unnecessary high financial cost preserve quality life . Robust data public health surveillance , survey general risk population require make decision allocate public health resource diagnose , assess treat HCV infection . In Belgium recent prevalence study conduct . The cited anti-HCV prevalence 0.87 % base study Flemish population publish 1997 collected 1994 . In French Belgian population overall seroprevalence 0.6 % . However , population study representative whole French community , recruit subject significantly young . A survey among cirrhotic hepatocellular patient French community reveal 20 % cirrhosis 47 % hepatocellular cancer relate hepatitis C. The diagnosis rate HCV Belgium estimate 43 % , signify 50 % HCV patient remain undiagnosed . Several study already mention age population especially bear Second World War carrier hepatitis C virus infection . Early detection HCV infection treat progress advance liver disease ( ALD ) excellent opportunity rationalize resource allocation improve patient ' quality life . Recently birth cohort screen recommendation develop United States . In Belgium , formal screening strategy exist . However Belgian association study liver ( BASL ) recommend targeted HCV screen high-risk population ( include individual blood transfusion major medical event prior 1 july 1990 , intranasal IDU dialysis patient ) addition nontargeted screen among pre-operative patient pregnant woman . A birth cohort analysis base model suggest birth cohort 1950 1975 Belgium . This population reflect 70 % viremic population . In study , investigator want estimate prevalence hepatitis C Belgium 2014 confirm propose targeted birth cohort risk factor . These data could provide efficient source identify newly diagnose patient part national screening strategy .</brief_summary>
