Five Canadian IVF clinic agree provide minimum 200 anonymized sample information cycle/patient medical status . From sample , RNA extract gene expression level measure 3 housekeep gene 21 marker derive previous study ( Hamel et al 2008 2010 , Nivet et al 2015 submit ) . The gene lead best predictive value negative outcome classify accord understand ovarian physiology key indicator generate diagnostic . The read-out provide clinic would one 5 following : Too early trigger , late trigger , high stimulation ( FSH ) , high differentiation ( LH ) time spread response ( combination immature mature follicle )</detailed_description>
