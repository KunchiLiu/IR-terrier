	<brief_title>Astaxanthin Formulation Bioavailability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Astaxanthin commercially available several vendor . As highly-lipophilic compound , oral bioavailability likely limited solubility gut . Pre-formulation strategy address limited solubility include pre-dissolving astaxanthin fatty solvent encapsulate gelatin capsule . This study evaluate oral bioavailability six different formulation astaxanthin ( 12mg ) double blind crossover study involve 12 subject . All subject ask abstain consume salmon 48hrs consume food alcoholic beverages 10 hour report blood draw center 8 AM . They feed standardize breakfast choose one two Jimmy Dean brand breakfast sandwich ( EGG , RED PEPPERS , ONIONS AND PEPPER JACK CHEESE CROISSANT BACON , EGG &amp; CHEESE BISCUIT . Immediately follow standardized meal , take one six different formulation contain 12 mg astaxanthin . Bottled water ( ZephyrhillsÂ® Brand 100 % Natural Spring Water ) available subject ad lib . Blood collect immediately consume standardize meal formulation ( 0 hr ) 4 , 8 , 10 , 24 hour post dose licensed phlebotomist . In blood draw , subject allow leave clinic allow resume normal diet lifestyle . However , ask abstain consume alcoholic beverage salmon completion last blood draw 24hrs . As measure quality control , subject receive breathalyzer test alcohol prior 0 24 hr blood draw . For time point , blood collect one 10ml Vacutainer Tube ( BD 16x100 contain K2 EDTA ) label use randomization scheme blind sample . Because 3 formulation powder remain 3 formulation capsule , differ slightly size appearance , neither subject investigator blind formulation test give day . However , subject receive separate random assignment 6 formulation test course study blood sample blind quantitative analysis astaxanthin plasma level . This process repeat six time entire subject population ( with-in subject design ) two-week washout period pharmacokinetic ( pK ) run . The blinded blood sample keep refrigerate transported Center Excellence Brain Repair ( CEABR ) lab within 24 hour , process subject High pressure liquid chromatograph ( HPLC ) analysis quantify astaxanthin .</detailed_description>
