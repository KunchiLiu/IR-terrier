	<brief_summary>Cow 's milk ( CM ) allergy common food allergy child , affect 2-3 % infant . In formula-fed infant CM allergy , extensively hydrolyze amino acid-based infant formula typically recommend . These formula expensive palatable . For old patient CM allergy , standard care avoidance CM product . The investigator care CM allergic patient able tolerate partially hydrolyze whey formula ( pHWF ) , taste good less expensive extensively hydrolyze amino-acid base formula . There likely subject could similarly tolerate pHWF . Furthermore , possible take pHWF could accelerate tolerance CM . The investigator aim identify characteristic CM allergic subject tolerate pHWF ass degree take pHWF accelerate CM tolerance .</brief_summary>
