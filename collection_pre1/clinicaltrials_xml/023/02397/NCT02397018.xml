	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess safety single , intravenous infusion bank allogeneic umbilical cord blood subject within 3-10 day follow acute ischemic stroke . The subject pre-treated immunosuppressive agent . The primary objective safety assessment secondary objective determine outcome measure use primary secondary endpoint future randomize Phase 2 clinical trial , describe clinical response , . All subject receive standard care acute rehabilitation treatment enrol study . This multicenter Phase 1 safety study patient 18-80 year age sustain recent ischemic stroke . A total 10 subject enrol . Subjects give series baseline neurological assessment , blood test , MRI . Umbilical cord blood unit select public cord blood bank base ABO/Rh blood type cell dose , target range 0.5 5 x 10^7 total nucleated cells/kg . Umbilical cord blood administer intravenously single infusion 3 10 day post-stroke . Subjects monitor 6 hour post-infusion , follow occur 24 hour later . Subsequent follow phone call occur 1 , 6 , 12 month , include telephone survey post-stroke rehabilitation functioning . A follow clinic visit 90 day include neurological exam , MRI , blood test . Risks cord blood infusion include infusion-related reaction anaphylaxis , urticaria , dyspnea , hypoxia , cough , wheeze , bronchospasm , nausea , vomit , hive , fever , hypertension , hypotension , bradycardia , tachycardia , rigor , chill , infection , hemoglobinuria . Less likely , long-term risk include transmission infection Graft v Host Disease .</detailed_description>
