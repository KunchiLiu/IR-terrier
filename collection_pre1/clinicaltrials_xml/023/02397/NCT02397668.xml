	<brief_title>CorMatrix ECM Tricuspid Valve Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CorMatrix Cardiovascular , Inc. develop device heart valve replacement , CorMatrix® ECM® Tricuspid Valve , implant replace dysfunctional tricuspid heart valve . This Early Feasibility Study propose obtain initial insight ability successfully implant Tricuspid Valve , clinical safety device , whether device performs intend use .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patient regurgitant absent tricuspid valve include patient concomitant cardiac procedure 2 . Patient/authorized legal guardian understands nature procedure , willing comply associate followup evaluation , provide write informed consent pediatric patient ( applicable ) provide write assent ( able ) prior procedure 3 . Patient/patient 's authorized legal guardian geographically stable ( willing return require study followup ) understand willing fulfill expect requirement clinical protocol 1 . Tricuspid annulus small ( &lt; 12mm ) accommodate CorMatrix ECM Tricuspid Valve 2 . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; = 30 % 3 . Mean pulmonary pressure &gt; = 50mm Hg 4 . Emergency cardiac procedureor patient require mechanical cardiac support ( e.g. , balloon pump , ECMO ) 5 . Acute myocardial infarction within 7 day enrollment unless cardiac enzyme return normal 6 . Patients single ventricle CorMatrix Tricuspid Valve would systemic AV valve 7 . Documented primary coagulopathy platelet disorder , include thrombocytopenia ( absolute platelet count &lt; 60k ) 8 . Documented evidence intrinsic hepatic disease ( define liver enzyme value ( AST , ALT total bilirubin ) &gt; 5 time upper limit reference range within 30 day enrollment , except association acute decompensation determine Investigator ) 9 . Documented evidence significant renal dysfunction ( serum creatinine &gt; 3.0mg/dl ) form dialysis time screen 10 . Patient infection treat antibiotic &lt; 7 day prior enrollment 11 . Stroke within 90 day prior enrollment , history cerebral vascular disease significant ( &gt; 80 % ) extra cranial stenosis ( patient CVD history document carotid Doppler study ) 12 . Known cancer ( cancerfree &lt; 1 year ; include nonmetastatic basal cell carcinoma cervical carcinoma ) and/or undergoing treatment include chemotherapy radiotherapy 13 . Hematological disorder ( e.g. , aplastic anemia ) patient take bone marrow suppressant drug 14 . Patients plan lead wire CorMatrix ECM Tricuspid Valve follow implant . Note : No wire lead inside CorMatrix ECM Tricuspid Valve follow implant . Alternative way place lead exclusion ( e.g . epicardial ) 15 . Psychiatric behavioral disease ( include drug alcohol abuse antisocial disorder ) likely impair compliance study protocol 16 . Known sensitivity porcine material 17 . Contraindication anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy ( ASA and/or Plavix ) 18 . Patients pregnant ( method assessment Investigator 's discretion ) 19 . Patients currently enrol another investigational study registry would directly impact treatment outcome current study , without CorMatrix write approval</criteria>
