	<brief_summary>This phase 2 study assess ability 11C- 18F-choline detect localize prostate cancer within prostate gland patient unfavorable intermediate high-risk prostate cancer ( CAPRA 5-10 ) . Secondary objective assess ability 11C- 18F-choline PET/MR detect metastatic prostate cancer within pelvic lymph node patient undergo radical prostatectomy extend pelvic lymph node dissection , assess ability 11C- 18F-choline PET/MR detect specific location metastatic prostate cancer within pelvic lymph node region patient undergo radical prostatectomy extend pelvic lymph node dissection , determine agreement 11C- 18F-choline PET image detection localization local metastatic disease image techniques/methods ( bone scan , CT , multiparametric 1H MRI , advance body NaF PET/CT ) , determine temporal distribution 11C- 18F-choline radiotracer patient . The tissue uptake , retention , clearance determine . An exploratory objective comparing region uptake 11C- 18F-choline PET/MR sentinel lymph node imaging perform .</brief_summary>
