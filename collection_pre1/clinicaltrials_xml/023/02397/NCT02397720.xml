	<brief_summary>There 2 part study : Part A ( dose escalation ) Part B ( dose expansion ) . The goal Part A clinical research study find high tolerable dose nivolumab azacitidine give patient AML . The goal Part B study learn dose find Part A help control AML . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Nivolumab ( BMS-936558 ) Combination With 5-azacytidine ( Vidaza ) Treatment Patients With Refractory/ Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia Newly Diagnosed Older Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) ( &gt; 65 Years ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 5 group 6 participant enrol Part A study , 110 participant enrol Part B study . If enrol Part A study , dose nivolumab azacitidine receive depend join study . The first group participant receive start dose level nivolumab azacitidine . If intolerable side effect see , next group may receive low dose level nivolumab and/or azacitidine . This continue high tolerable combination dose find . If enrol Part B , receive nivolumab azacitidine high dose tolerate Part A . There 2 group Part B : Part 1B Part 2B . Up 70 participant AML young 65 year old enrol Part 1B 40 participant AML 65 year old enrol Part 2B . Study Treatment : Each cycle 28 day long . However , cycle may longer shorter depend disease responds treatment doctor think best interest . The study doctor tell study cycle longer shorter 28 day . You receive azacitidine vein 1 hour injection skin . You receive drug either Days 1-7 cycle , Days 1-5 8 9 cycle . The study doctor tell receive drug , may change method schedule best interest . You also receive nivolumab vein 1 hour Days 1 14 ( +/- 3 day ) Cycles 1-4 Day 1 Cycles 5 beyond . Depending disease responds study drug , number day receive study drug may change . Your doctor discus . If study doctor think best interest , dose azacitidine and/or nivolumab may change and/or delay . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle ( +/- 4 day ) , physical exam . One ( 1 ) time week Cycles 1-3 1 time every 2-4 week Cycle 3 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . If doctor think need , may blood draw often . If doctor think acceptable , may blood draw local lab clinic . The result send study doctor MD Anderson . On Day 28 Cycle 1 ( +/- 7 day ) every 1-3 cycle , bone marrow aspiration/biopsy check status disease . Any time doctor think need study : - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) may draw routine test . - You may bone marrow aspiration/biopsy check status disease . Length Study : You receive nivolumab azacitidine long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Study Visit : Within 14 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check status disease . Follow-Up : You call 30 day end-of-study visit ask side effect and/or start new treatment ( ) . This call last 5 minute . You may also ask come clinic physical exam , study staff think need . Long-Term Follow-Up : If disease appear get well take study drug , call every 3-6 month 5 year . Each call last 5 minute . You may also ask come clinic physical exam , study staff think need . This investigational study . Azacitidine FDA approve commercially available treatment myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) approve frontline therapy AML elderly participant . Nivolumab commercially available approve treatment certain type melanoma lung cancer . Their use study consider investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 110 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
