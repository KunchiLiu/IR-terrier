	<detailed_description>Forty-eight patient ( 22 men , 26 woman ) enrol study receive 48 implant . The population divide 2 group : Group A implant ( n=23 ) load immediately day surgery Group B implant ( n=19 ) load 3 week surgery . Cone Beam Computed Tomography ( CBCT ) scan take preoperatively aid treatment planning . Bone density evaluate CBCT scan Hounsfield unit ( HU ) tactile feedback surgery . Insertion torque record time implant placement . Resonance frequency analysis , perform day surgery , time loading , 6 , 12 24 month , use record implant stability accord unit 's Implant Stability Quotient ( Osstell ISQ ) . Standardized radiograph take time implant placement 6 , 12 24 month measure crestal bone stability . Bone level change measure software ( Image J , available online : http : //rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html ; last access 28 August 2014 ) .</detailed_description>
