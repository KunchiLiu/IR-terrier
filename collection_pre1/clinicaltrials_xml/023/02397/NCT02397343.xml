	<brief_title>The Effect Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Inflammatory Parameters Induced Heat Injury Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperbaric oxygen ( HBO ) reduce neuropathic pain , promote heal hypoxic , chronic wound sore cause radiation therapy . Nitric oxide ( NO ) contribute factor prolong anti-nociceptive effect HBO treatment . In addition , HBO stimulate formation reactive oxygen nitrogen form , reduce beta-2 integrin function , reduce contact leukocytes endothelial surface capillary , improve microcirculation cause decrease monocyte chemokine synthesis . It interaction mechanism involve HBO 's anti-inflammatory effect . How HBO reduces pain inflammation human establish . In healthy subject , investigator show HBO reduce effect mechanism , level spinal cord amplifies number extension pain impulse . Subjects give HBO therapy initially develop significantly less secondary hyperalgesia control group several week later new heat injury suggest protective , precondition effect . As previous experiment ( NCT02025686 ) precondition effect assess mean measurement thermal threshold , pin-prick threshold , erythema index secondary hyperalgesic area ( i.e . area curve per minute ) . Similarly , difference sequence session ( i.e . first session HBO ; second session ambient pressure condition first session ambient pressure condition ; second session HBO ) analyze accordingly . In improved blind study design investigator investigate effect HBO treatment use cutaneous heat injury model , first study . Investigators expect finally able confirm previous result thereby improve treatment severe pain condition .</detailed_description>
