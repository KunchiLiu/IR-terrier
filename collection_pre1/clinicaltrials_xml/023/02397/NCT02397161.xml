	<brief_summary>Objective : To compare effectiveness EEG biofeedback mental attention-neuromuscular training ( AT-NMT ) , neuromuscular training ( NMT ) alone , EEG biofeedback mental attention training ( AT ) alone , intervention improve reactive balance performance among child developmental coordination disorder ( DCD ) . Design : A single-blinded , randomize control clinical trial . Sample : 172 child DCD . Interventions : AT-NMT , NMT , AT , intervention 12 week . Major outcome : Outcomes evaluate baseline , post-intervention , 3-month follow-up . A motor control test ( MCT ) give composite latency score , prefrontal cortex EEG record MCT measure mental attention level , surface electromyography recording MCT indicate low limb muscle onset latency .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : The Investigators hypothesize reactive balance performance child DCD best improve treat mental attention neuromuscular deficit . Objective : To compare effectiveness AT-NMT , NMT alone , AT alone , intervention improve reactive balance performance among child DCD . Design : A single-blinded , randomize control clinical trial . Sample : 172 child DCD . Interventions : AT-NMT , NMT , AT , intervention 12 week . Major outcome : Outcomes evaluate baseline , post-intervention , 3-month follow-up . A motor control test ( MCT ) give composite latency score , prefrontal cortex EEG record MCT measure mental attention level , surface electromyography recording MCT indicate low limb muscle onset latency . Anticipated result clinical significance : Children DCD receive AT-NMT best reactive balance performance outcomes . If result positive , novel training regime readily adopt clinical practice . AT-NMT improve overall well-being child positive socio-economic implication short rehabilitation period reduce healthcare cost .</detailed_description>
