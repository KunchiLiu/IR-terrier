	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy TTFields ( 150 kHz ) Concomitant With Pemetrexed Cisplatin Carboplatin Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma ( STELLAR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PAST PRE CLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE : The effect TTFields demonstrate significant activity vitro mesothelioma pre-clinical model single modality treatment combination pemetrexed cisplatin , chemotherapy commonly use treat malignant pleural mesothelioma . In pilot clinical trial ( first men ) TTFields show effect monotherapy one patient malignant pleural mesothelioma apply patient 's abdomen ( disease metastasize abdomen ) . In pilot study , 42 patient stage IIIB- IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) tumor progression least one line prior chemotherapy receive pemetrexed together TTFields apply chest upper abdomen disease progression . Efficacy endpoints remarkably high compare historical data pemetrexed alone . In large prospective , randomized trial , recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) . The outcome subject treat TTFields compare treat effective best standard care chemotherapy ( include bevacizumab ) . TTFields arm subject comparable overall survival subject receive best available chemotherapy US today . Similar result show comparability TTFields best standard care ( BSC ) chemotherapy see secondary endpoint . Recurrent GBM patient treat TTFields trial experience few side effect general , significantly few treatment related side effect , significantly low gastrointestinal , hematological infectious adverse event compare control . The device-related adverse event see mild moderate skin irritation beneath device electrode . Finally , quality life measure well TTFields Therapy subject group compare subject receive effective best standard care chemotherapy . Recently , interim analysis large ongoing phase III trial newly diagnose GBM show add TTFields standard care temozolomide chemotherapy significantly prolong patient ' progression free survival overall survival . An independent data monitoring committee recommend stop trial early success . The FDA approve cross control arm patient TTFields arm trial . DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL : All patient include trial diagnose malignant pleural mesothelioma . In addition , patient must meet eligibility criterion . Eligible patient enrol , baseline test perform patient treat continuously device concomitant weekly pemetrexed cisplatin carboplatin disease progression . TTFields treatment consist wear four electrically insulated electrode array thorax . Electrode array placement require shave chest/back necessary treatment . After initial short visit clinic training monitoring , patient release continue treatment home maintain regular daily routine . During trial patient need return every 3 week clinic examination physician routine laboratory examination do . These routine visit continue long patient 's disease progressing . A routine CT scan chest abdomen perform baseline every 6 week thereafter , disease progression . After follow plan , patient contact per month telephone answer basic question health status . SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND : Electric field exert force electric charge similar way magnet exerts force metallic particle within magnetic field . These force cause movement rotation electrically charge biological building block , much like alignment metallic particle see along line force radiate outwards magnet . Electric field also cause muscle twitch strong enough may heat tissue . TTFields alternate electric field low intensity . This mean change direction repetitively many time second . Since change direction rapidly ( 150 thousand time second ) , cause muscle twitch , effect electrically activate tissue body ( brain , nerve heart ) . Since intensity TTFields body low , cause heating . The breakthrough finding make Novocure finely tune alternate field low intensity , term TTFields ( Tumor Treating Fields ) , cause significant slow growth cancer cell . Due unique geometric shape cancer cell multiply , TTFields cause building block cell move pile way cell physically explode . In addition , cancer cell also contain miniature building block act tiny motor move essential part cell place place . TTFields cause tiny motor fall apart since special type electric charge . As result two effect , cancer tumor growth slow even reverse continuous exposure TTFields . Other cell body ( normal healthy tissue ) affect much less cancer cell since multiply much slow rate . In addition TTFields direct certain part body , leave sensitive area reach . In conclusion , TTFields hold promise serve brand new cancer treatment side effect promise affectivity slow reverse disease .</detailed_description>
