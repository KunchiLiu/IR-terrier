	<brief_title>Memory Preservation Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation With Hippocampal Avoidance ( PREMER-TRIAL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) become standard care select patient limited extensive stage small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) show benefit chemotherapy without thoracic radiotherapy . Because hippocampal involvement metastatic disease rare , preclinical clinical evidence suggest radiation dose receive hippocampus whole brain radiotherapy may play role radiation-induced neurocognitive decline , spar hippocampus administration PCI result low rate memory loss . Previous study demonstrate dosimetric capability intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) conformably avoid hippocampus without detriment radiation dose remain brain receives . The main objective trial compare neurocognitive functioning follow hippocampal avoidance PCI standard PCI treatment measure Free Cued Selective Reminding Test ( FCSRT ) . The FCSRT measure verbal learn memory . The FCSRT emphasize encode specificity learn recall . One secondary objective trial test hypothesis lower neurocognitive function patient due substantial reduction hippocampal volume magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Others objectives evaluate quality life ( QoL ) rate metastasis hippocampus .</detailed_description>
