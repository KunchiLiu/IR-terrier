	<brief_title>Intra-vaginal Electrical Stimulation Device Compared Sham Device Chronic Pelvic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic pelvic pain ( CPP ) complex devastate diagnosis , encompass multiple different condition . Many organ system may involve include musculoskeletal , neurologic , genitourinary , psychiatric gastrointestinal system . Furthermore , associate major insomnia , psychosexual trauma , mood disorder result challenging case characterize pain refractory standard treatment modality . In study conduct Mathias et al. , one seven woman experience chronic pelvic pain . The economic burden substantial , previous estimate 2.8 billion dollar per year . ( 1 ) Dyspareunia define recurrent persistent pain associate sexual intercourse affect approximately 8-21 % woman United States ( 19 , 20 ) . Understandably , woman dyspareunia often suffer decline sexual functioning . It may lead decreased arousal , loss libido , anorgasmia . However , impact extend beyond sexual functioning affect woman 's reproductive health overall sense well-being . Previous estimate indicate 88 % sexually active chronic pelvic pain patient report pain intercourse ( 1 ) . Treatment chronic pelvic challenge due poor understand pain processing physiology . Each patient 's experience pain unique may combination visceral , neuropathic , even somatic etiology . Persistent pain despite aggressive treatment organic etiology may imply psychogenic overlay . A comprehensive integrative approach ideal may include physical therapy , medication , cognitive behavioral therapy . Pelvic floor physical therapy effective treatment . Pelvic floor rehabilitation address pelvic floor dysfunction may include manual therapy , transvaginal biofeedback electrical stimulation . Reissing et al . perform retrospective chart review discover physical therapy , particularly internal manual technique , successful technique treat patient vaginismus ( 5 ) . Electrical stimulation ( ES ) pelvic floor effective treatment vaginismus , vulvar vestibulitis , urinary urgency , levator ani hypertonus ( 11-15 ) . ES deliver specifically transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator ( TENS ) unit result notable benefit pain dyspareunia ( 8,12,21-23 ) . Murina et al . conduct randomize controlled trial comparing use vaginal probe deliver electrical stimulation sham device . In study , use TENS unit treat vestibulodynia use protocol 15 min 10 Hz follow 15 minute 50 Hz . These session complete twice per week basis 10 week . Pain score , dyspareunia overall sexual functioning significantly improve active arm compare placebo ( 8 ) . Another study use TENS unit treat primary dysmenorrhea . In protocol , TENS unit set 100 Hz 100ms pulse width first 8 hour menstrual cycle repeat another menstrual cycle ( 9 ) . A small study 12 woman use electrical stimulation biofeedback gradual desensitization treatment vaginismus . After treatment , 12 woman able vaginal intercourse ( 13 ) . Electrical stimulation use extensively treatment various pain disorder . It deliver peripheral nerve stimulation , TENS unit , sacral neuromodulation use implantable device . Electrical stimulation three different programmable setting include frequency , intensity pulse duration . High frequency consider &gt; 50 Hz whereas low frequency &lt; 10 Hz . The intensity , also know power , unit set sensory motor threshold frequency ( 2 ) . There several theory explain mechanism action electrical stimulation . TENS work alter ability perceive pain signal . The gate theory one propose mechanism action . Electrical stimulation nerve via specific dermatome result block gate effect dorsal horn spinal cord . This inhibit transmission pain impulse upper nervous system . Also , low frequency stimulation dermatome increase level endorphin , provide pain relief . ( 2 ) The sacral nerve root 2-4 hold autonomic somatic innervation pelvic floor , bladder , urethra . Therefore , stimulation sacral nerve root 2-4 provide mean modulate impulse pelvic floor . Inhibition afferent innervation pelvic floor bladder achieve afferent activation sacral nerve root use Interstim® similar device . In word , stimulate sacral nerve root neuromodulation inhibitory effect pain pathway spinal cord level . ( 3 ) Treatment chronic pelvic pain may include peripheral nerve stimulation via posterior tibial nerve . This mixed nerve share spinal origin innervation bladder pelvic floor . Stimulation posterior tibial nerve travel retrograde modulate afferent input bladder pelvic floor . ( 4 ) Therefore , share similar mechanism action sacral neuromodulation spare patient complication associate surgical implantation device . Despite efficacy benefit , electrical stimulation time intensive dependent upon health care provider 's schedule . It often cause patient social embarrassment result inaccessibility . Although electrical stimulation provide pain relief , even highly motivated patient report anxiety prohibit participation physiotherapy ( 6 ) . The investigator propose novel treatment use non-implanted intra-vaginal electrical stimulation device use comfort privacy patient 's home . This address several barrier associate office , standard pelvic floor physical therapy . Furthermore , personal device allow patient active role treatment , empower ultimately , therapeutic . InControl Medical create line product FDA approve urinary incontinence fecal incontinence ( 10 ) . These device non-implanted , customizable , battery-operated vaginal probe make medical grade silicon provide electrical stimulation pelvic floor . One device , ApexM™ provide electrical stimulation frequency alternate 13 Hz 50 Hz allow clinician adjust intensity well duration electrical stimulation . The investigator propose use low power electrical stimulation treatment pain patient diagnose CPP . The electrical stimulation deliver use ApexM™ , adjust power sensory threshold prevent muscle contraction . The goal study evaluate use personal intravaginal , non- implanted electrical stimulation device treatment chronic pelvic pain . The investigator propose randomize controlled trial comparing investigated device sham device . The primary outcome pain control use visual analog scale brief pain inventory ( 18 ) . Hypothesis : Subjects report increase pain relief electrical stimulation device compare use sham device alone . Secondary goal : To evaluate effect ES overall quality life . Hypothesis : ES improve quality life measure Short Form-36 . ( 16 ) To evaluate effect ES sexual function . Hypothesis : ES improve sexual functioning measure Female Sexual Function Index ( 17 ) To evaluate use ES use pain medication . Hypothesis : ES decrease dosage frequency pain medication use . This measure use daily pain medication journal . Patients complete journal listing type , amount dosage pain medication use daily basis . SIGNIFICANCE If positive effect see , personal vaginal device design home use offer patient chronic pelvic pain . Patients would able take pelvic floor rehabilitation physical therapy office home . Furthermore , would justify large , multi-center , randomize control trial compare ApexM™ device standard office physical therapy .</detailed_description>
