	<brief_summary>Patients diabetes increase risk develop heart failure ( HF ) lead increase shortness breath , reduce ability exercise case premature death heart become less efficient pump blood around body . However treatment option patient remain limited . This study test safety benefit use new class drug , SGLT2 Inhibitor ( Dapagliflozin ) , treat HF diabetes . Participants Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan heart , measure efficiency extent thicken heart muscle start treatment dapagliflozin , placebo one year . They also exercise test exercise bike ( capable ) walk test plus fill questionnaire heart failure affect quality life . Participants continue normal currently prescribe medication diabetes heart failure . After year test repeat determine patient receive Dapagliflozin benefit n't drug . This study fund European Foundation Study Diabetes ( EFSD )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness SGLT-2 Inhibitors Patients With Heart Failure Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Men woman diabetes 2-5-fold increase risk heart failure ( HF ) . The prevalence incidence HF increase diabetes mortality rate remain alarmingly high . This highlight need novel therapy diabetes reduce HF risk /or delay disease progression . Drug option currently limit diabetic therapy thiazolidinediones contra-indicated HF . SGLT2 inhibitor , new class anti-diabetic drug , excite new approach diabetes management may additional beneficial effect diabetes HF . SGLT2 inhibitor may beneficial effect adverse leave ventricular ( LV ) remodelling occurs patient diabetes heart failure reduce load heart diuretic blood pressure lower action . Exercise intolerance cardinal symptom patient HF improve insulin sensitivity show improve exercise capacity . SGLT2 inhibition show improve insulin sensitivity reduce weight therefore potential improve exercise capacity HF . This study assess potential beneficial effect oral SGLT2 inhibitor , dapagliflozin , LV remodelling exercise capacity patient diabetes HF . The finding study may help establish utility SGLT2 inhibitor diabetic patient HF provide important clinical data impact SGLT2 inhibition LV remodelling .</detailed_description>
