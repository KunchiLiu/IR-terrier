	<brief_summary>The subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) rupture aneurysm situation life-threatening , largely dependent occurrence vasospasm 4th day bleeding . This vasopasm responsible clinical morbidity 30 50 % patient . It occur 40 % patient severe SAH . Despite know , clinician biomarker identify patient risk . The project present original include screen method without priori identify predictive biomarkers vasospasm , likely become therapeutic target . In secondary objective focus protease activity cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) blood biomarker potential vasoconstriction wan subarachnoid hemorrhage . This study take place year prospectively . The inclusion patient SAR 1 Hospital Timone . Patients severe severe SAH rupture require establishment external ventricular derivation ( EVD ) divide two group compare one group patient without necessitate EVD subarachnoid hemorrhage . - Group 1 : Patients vasopasm - Group 2 : Patient present vasopasm Detection vasopasm define use consensual definition . CSF sample ( EVD ) blood make upon arrival patient intensive care 3rd 4th day . As main criterion , identify biomarkers vasospasm blood CSF without priori assumption metabolomics . Analysis chromatography system couple high resolution mass spectrometer . This method justify effective calculation step generate hypothesis require biological validation base identify target . The secondary criterion , study blood CSF association matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) 2 9 occurrence vasopasm . RESULTS : After comparative analysis group 1 2 two phase study , define metabolic profile could identify predictive biomarkers vasopasm .</brief_summary>
