	<brief_summary>The SPARK trial test use Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring prostate cancer patient treat Stereotactic Prostate Adaptive Radiotherapy . The researcher expect trial result well target prostate cancer patient outcomes low toxicity . The potential application Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring tumour site pave way additional trial Australasian radiation oncology lead world .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Prostate Adaptive Radiotherapy Utilising Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most linear accelerator use treat cancer patient today equip fix X-ray imagers typically use take image tumour patient receives radiotherapy . A new technology , know Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring recently emerge allows image tumour take real-time treatment occur . The advantage Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring enable strategy patient shift beam shift treatment could potentially improve accuracy treatment reduce patient 's side effect . In addition , due accuracy Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring target tumour , number treatment session group patient require reduced five oppose 40 session require use conventional treatment method .</detailed_description>
