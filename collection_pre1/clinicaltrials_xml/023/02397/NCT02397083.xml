	<brief_title>Phase II Study Intrauterine Device ( IUD ) Alone Combination With Everolimus Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stage 1 Study Visits : The Levonorgestrel IUD : This study 2 stage . If find eligible take part study , Stage 1 , receive levonorgestrel IUD . The levonorgestrel IUD T-shaped birth control device make flexible plastic . It design prevent pregnancy release hormone call levonorgestrel , type progesterone . Progesterone common type hormone use prevent pregnancy . The IUD place exam pelvis . The uterine size measure IUD place directly uterus . This placement may do time dilation curettage ( D &amp; C , explain ) routine clinic visit . Removal IUD typically do clinic visit routine pelvic exam . The IUD string locate , grasp , use remove device . Study Surgery IUD Placement : On Day 1 ( within 1 week screen ) standard care procedure call dilation curettage ( D &amp; C ) confirm diagnosis . You would procedure even take part study . For procedure , pelvic exam , receive general anesthesia put sleep . You may also receive medication numb cervix . During procedure small amount tissue scrap uterus . You sign separate consent form describe procedure risk detail . During D &amp; C , levonorgestrel IUD place uterus . If recently D &amp; C , procedure need repeat . Instead , IUD place clinic visit . About 1 week surgery , study staff review surgery pathology result . If result show change diagnosis hyperplasia early-stage cancer , doctor decide still eligible take part study . If pathology result show grade 2 high cancer uterus , unable take part study . The levonorgestrel IUD remove operating room surgery removal disease outside uterus . You may also levonorgestrel IUD remove clinic . At 4 week surgery , physical exam , include pelvic exam . Placement levonorgestrel IUD check pelvic exam . In addition , may ultrasound uterus confirm location IUD . If IUD correct location , replace visit . Stage 1 Study Visits : At 3 month IUD placement , endometrial biopsy ( biopsy uterine lining ) check status disease . This standard care would do even take part study . If biopsy show disease gotten bad , take study treatment option discuss . If disease appear become stable , continue Stage 2 study ( describe ) . You also physical exam blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test visit . If disease appear respond completely , standard care biopsy 3 month later confirm response . If confirm , follow every 6 month standard care biopsy disease appear get bad and/or physician decide remove IUD come study . If complete response confirm 6-month biopsy visit , take study doctor talk option include surgical non-surgical treatment . Stage 2 Study Groups : If 3 month IUD placement disease remain stable , assigned study group . You randomly assign ( roll dice ) 1 2 arm . This do one know one arm better , , bad arm . - If Arm 1 , continue levonorgestrel IUD alone . - If Arm 2 , receive everolimus every day addition continue levonorgestrel IUD . Stage 2 Study Drug Administration : If Arm 2 , 3 month IUD placement , take everolimus 1 time day mouth time every day . You take either consistently food every day consistently without food every day . Each cycle Stage 2 28 day . Stage 2 Study Visits -- Arm 1 : If Arm 1 , 6 Months IUD placement . - You physical exam , include pelvic exam . - You endometrial biopsy check status disease . If disease appear get good stay . You follow every 3 month standard care biopsy disease appear get bad and/or physician decide remove IUD come study . You physical exam biopsy 9 month 1 year . If disease appear gotten bad 9-month 1-year biopsy , disease stayed time 1-year biopsy , come study doctor talk option include surgical non-surgical treatment . If complete response time 1-year biopsy , standard care biopsy 3 month later confirm response . If confirm , standard care biopsy every 6 month disease appear get bad and/or physician decide remove IUD . Stage 2 Study Visits -- Arm 2 : If Arm 2 , Day 1 Cycle : - You physical exam , include pelvic exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check hepatitis check liver function . If Arm 2 , Cycles 3 , 6 9 : - You physical exam , include pelvic exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You follow-up endometrial biopsy check status disease . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check liver function . If disease appear completely responded time Cycle 9 biopsy , endometrial biopsy confirm response Cycle 12 . If confirm , biopsy every 6 cycle long study . You also follow test procedures 1 time cycle start Cycle 10 : You physical exam , include pelvic exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . If doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check liver function . If disease appear gotten bad time Cycle 3 , 6 , 9 biopsy , stop take everolimus come study . The doctor talk surgical and/or non-surgical treatment option . If disease remain stable time Cycle 9 biopsy , come study doctor talk surgical and/or non-surgical treatment option . Biomarker Testing : Leftover tissue previous procedure test biomarkers . Biomarkers find blood/tissue may relate response levonorgestrel . Biomarker test also perform leftover tissue Month 3 EMB . End-of-Treatment Visit ( Arm 2 ) : After long receive study treatment ( ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . This investigational study . The levonorgestrel IUD commercially available FDA approve form birth control . The use IUD treat endometrial cancer investigational . Everolimus FDA approve commercially available treat kidney , breast , pancreatic cancer . The combination everolimus levonorgestrel IUD study treat endometrial cancer investigational . Up 270 patient enrol study . Up 250 take part MD Anderson 20 take part Harris Health System .</detailed_description>
