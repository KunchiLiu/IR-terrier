	<detailed_description>Introduction Since first described 1965 1 , phencyclidine derivative ketamine [ ( RS ) -2- ( 2-Chlorophenyl ) -2- ( methylamino ) cyclohexanone ] gain widespread use anaesthetic , sedative analgesic . 2 There evidence ketamine might possess antidepressant effect well . 3 In anaesthetic dosage , ketamine produce dissociative anaesthesia low respiratory circulatory depressive effect . Therefore optimal anaesthetic e.g . haemodynamically compromised patient minimal respiratory depression desirable induction anaesthesia , e.g . emergency care . 2 Despite , adverse psychomimetic effect hallucination initially observe effect intracranial pressure ( ICP ) limit use ketamine without additional sedation patient neurological injury . 4 Increasing evidence , however , support notion - control ventilation - ketamine safely use patient neurotrauma 5 adverse psychometric side effect less pronounced S ( + ) -enantiomer . 6,7 Both chiral form ketamine modulate nociception mainly via inhibition N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) -receptor activation . 8 Analgesic effect also relate modulation signal via nitric oxide ( NO ) synthase inhibition 4,9 , monoamine 10,11 muscarinic 12 neurotransmission , µ- , δ- κ-opiate receptor agonism 13 . S ( + ) -ketamine observe exert analgesic effect two-to-four time racemic ketamine 17 R ( - ) -isomer 18 alone . Although observation regard unwanted psychometric effect equianalgetic dosage S ( + ) -enantiomer racemic ketamine favour S ( + ) -ketamine 6,7 controversial 17,18 , would seem superior potency 17 short duration effect 19 S ( + ) -ketamine allow easy dose titration . Ketamine administrate via intravenous , intramuscular , subcutaneous , rectal , oral , transdermal , intranasal , sublingual , transmucosal , epidural , intrathecal , intra-articular route . 20-30 Following intravenous administration , bioavailability 90 % peak anaesthetic effect observe 1 5 minute . 2 Parenteral administration result effective analgesia due avoidance first-pass metabolism liver less potent norketamine , , hand , oral administration may result less psychometric side effect norketamine exert hallucinogenic property . 2 Pharmacokinetic property inhale ketamine study officially , one researcher test nebulized ketamine repeat painful stimulus monitoring apply . Based experiment , analgesic effect roughly estimate begin 3 minute . Ketamine metabolise liver via cytochrome ( CYP2B6 , CYP3A4 CYP2C9 ) -enzyme pathways . 14,15 An active metabolite ketamine - norketamine - posse potency approximately one-third ketamine . Ketamine metabolites renally excrete elimination half-life approximately 2-3 hour . 16 Ketamine use successfully treat acute pain intranasal form . Studies prehospital emergency department setting conclude nasally administer ketamine provide rapid effective pain relief . Ketamine well tolerate study , side effect transient require treatment . 36,37 Results promising , nasal administration difficulty . Intranasal administration irritate nasal mucosa cause discomfort . Excessive mucus production , nose bleeds destruction nasal mucosa reduce effectiveness drug give intranasally . Administration nebulized , inhaled form could provide without problem advantage intranasal administration . Early , ketamine observe possess bronchodilatory effect . 32 Ketamine increase pulmonary compliance , decrease airway resistance bronchospasm likely increase catecholamine release , thus raise ß2-adrenergic stimulation additionally inhibit vagal stimulation . 32,33 Inhaled nebulised ketamine investigate experimental animal model treatment allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness inflammation . 34 In study alveolar ketamine observe suppress allergen-mediated airway hyperreactivity airway inflammation . In another experimental study , application S ( + ) -ketamine fluid-instilled lung anesthetize rat reduce alveolar fluid clearance decrease amiloride-sensitive transepithelial Na+ -transport . 35 Currently , human study use ketamine analgesic nebulised , inhaled form . Objectives The primary purpose study evaluate whether nebulised S ( + ) -ketamine carry potential analgesic bypass first pas metabolism without need intravenous access . Secondary aim ass duration analgesia obtain nebulized S-ketamine . Thirdly , aim evaluate whether inhaled nebulized ketamine decrease need rescue analgesia PACU care . Our hypothesis inhale ketamine provide pain relief , observe low numerical rating scale ( NRS ) value ketamine administration . Material method Subjects The subject recruit among patient come surgical intervention ( orthopedic , gastrointestinal , plastic urologic surgery ) need observation postoperative care unit ( PACU ) . It calculate sample size 8 subject per group would require achieve statistical power 80 % detect difference 3 unit NRS-values standard deviation 2 unit type I error 5 % . To prepare possible dropout , total 20 subject recruit ( 10 group ) . Inclusion criterion - male - 18-65 year - PACU care general anaesthesia Exclusion criterion - female - asthma - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - diabetes mellitus - unstable angina pectoris - high intracranial pressure - elevate intraocular pressure - neurosurgery - epidural spinal analgesia - history long term pain state - poor co-operation Research methods The study conduct double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial . A crossover design choose order reduce incidence confound factor . When patient arrive PACU , monitoring commence . Non-invasive blood pressure ( NIBP ) , blood oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) , 3-lead electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , respiratory rate Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) monitor record 3 minute interval throughout protocol , otherwise every 15 minute . The subject observe change neuropsychological status include behavior , sensory perception pupillary status . Also respiratory pattern salivation observe . Peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) measure within 5 minute exposure study drug . Patients receive either nebulized placebo ( i.e . saline ) ketamine ( Ketanest-S ) require pain alleviation PACU . Dosage ketamine 1 mg/kg 36 . Patients randomize two group group 's first inhalation contains ketamine second inhalation placebo opposite order . Neither subject researcher know order preparation administer . A person involve study prepare drug beforehand label A B . Order preparation determine use sequentially number , seal opaque envelope contain order preparation give ( either A B B A ) . Envelope open patient arrives PACU . Inhalations give sequentially patient asks pain medication . Subjects receive two inhalation total . Time inhalation measure order find whether analgesia S-ketamine last long time period placebo . The second inhalation serf rescue medication first inhalation , may dose three minute first inhalation significant reduction pain achieve NRS scale ( &gt; 3 point ) . After second inhalation , pain patient treat accord clinical need follow protocol design anaesthesiologist responsible patient . In hospital iv oxycodone 1-4mg use suitable . Before drug administration intensity pain rat use numerical rating scale ( NRS ) 0 10 ( 0 = pain , 10 = worst imaginable pain ) . Besides evaluate spontaneous postoperative pain , pain induce pinprick test . Pinprick test perform stick subject 's arm sharp wooden toothpick . After drug administration , prick carry continuously rating pain intensity , NRS-values level baseline . Time start time baseline NRS-value reach , measured estimate duration analgesia . Adverse effect evaluate use Side Effects Rating Scale Dissociative Anesthetics ( SERSDA ) . Patients contact 24 hour complete study query possible adverse effect severity use SERSDA . Side effect include fatigue , dizziness , nausea , headache , feel unreality , change hear vision , mood change , generalize discomfort hallucination . Severity side effect rat scale 0 4 ( 0 = change , 4 = bothersome ) . Data analysis SPSS-program use statistical analysis . Non-parametric test apply analysis . P-values &lt; 0,05 consider statistically significant . Ethical consideration Guidelines Good Clinical Practice follow 38 . The study conduct volunteer control PACU setting . A write , informed consent require participation . Withdrawal study protocol allow point intention treat analysis apply affect patient 's treatment hospital . The study monitor . Participants harm study . The minimal intensity painful stimulus necessary obtain study goal use perform routinely : NIBP surgery every five minute PACU every 15 minute , pinprick evaluate level postoperative analgetic treatment . Potential risk minimize closely monitoring subject whole duration study . PACU personnel prepare case adverse effect occur . All data gather study treat confidentiality analyze group level . An identification number ( ID ) give name participant remove ensure anonymity . Only member research group access participant ' identity information . All data store lock , fireproof cabinet . Only researcher access data study code . Implementation Timetable Recruiting study subject start soon ethical National Agency Medicines ( FIMEA ) process complete , aim early fall 2014 .
