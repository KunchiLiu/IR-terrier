	<brief_title>An Efficacy , Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetics Study 12 Weeks Treatment With Simeprevir Daclatasvir Participants With Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1b 4 Infection Either Severe Renal Impairment End-stage Renal Disease Hemodialysis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , open-label ( identity study drug know volunteer study staff ) , single-arm , multicenter ( one hospital work medical research study ) study evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics 12 week treatment Simeprevir ( SMV ) Daclatasvir ( DCV ) participants chronic Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) genotype 1b 4 infection either severe renal impairment End-stage Renal Disease hemodialysis . The study consist Screening Phase 4 week , Open-label Treatment Phase 12 week , post-Treatment Follow-up Phase 24 week . The total study duration participant approximately 40 week . All participant receive treatment regimen consist SMV 150 mg DCV 60 mg co-administered daily total treatment duration 12 week . Participants experience inadequate virologic response Week 8 ( define confirm HCV RNA great equal [ &gt; = ] low limit quantification [ LLOQ ] ) viral breakthrough on-treatment visit ( define confirm increase HCV RNA &gt; 1 log base 10 nadir , confirm HCV RNA &gt; 100 International unit per milliliter [ IU/mL ] participant whose HCV RNA previously &lt; LLOQ treatment ) discontinue study drug . Participants primarily evaluate sustained virologic response 12 week actual end study treatment ( SVR12 ) . Participants ' safety evaluate throughout study duration .</detailed_description>
