	<brief_summary>OroDental anomaly one phenotypical aspect least 900 rare disease syndrome affect definition le 1 2000 individual within population ( almost 25 million person Europe ) . They often describe association organ system malformation , understandable , gene signal pathway regulate oral cavity formation odontogenesis development organ . The various dental orofacial anomaly classify type ( anomaly tooth number , shape , size , structure mineralize tissue , eruption , resorption , tumor ; anomalies oral mucosa ; anomaly tongue… ) , signal pathway syndrome family . These anomaly ( example hypodontia/oligodontia , amelogenesis imperfecta , dentinogenesis imperfecta… ) become increasingly identify diagnostic predictive trait . Not important recognise , name appropriately integrate dysmorphic clue patient dysmorphology analysis essential synthesize observation confront exist data similar orodental anomaly encounter correspond mutant mouse model . Translational approach development medicine , relevant gain understanding molecular event underlie clinical manifestation enhance diagnostic accuracy . The aim study improve knowledge , diagnosis care oral cavity pathology encounter rare disease via identification gather national international patient cohort structure molecular diagnosis behind condition via target next-generation sequencing assay . Data collection implement validated accredited tool ( database ) comply legal regulation patient data protection medical record collection . All information anonymized .
