	<brief_summary>The mainstay control soil-transmitted helminth ( STH ) school-based deworming recent model highlight low transmission setting , treatment school-aged child unlikely interrupt transmission , new treatment strategy require . This study seek answer question : possible interrupt transmission STH , cost-effective treatment strategy delivery system achieve goal ? In study , two pair community cluster randomise trial different setting Kenya evaluate impact cost-effectiveness annual school-based deworming , annual community-based deworming , biannual community-based deworming . The intervention ( ) annual mass anthelmintic treatment deliver either pre-school school-aged child , part national school-based deworming programme , entire community deliver community health worker . The primary outcome measure prevalence hookworm infection ( common STH specie ) , assess periodic cross-sectional , age-stratified parasitological survey . Secondary outcome include intensity hookworm , prevalence intensity Ascaris lumbricoides , treatment coverage , among randomly select sub-sample participant follow longitudinally , worm burden proportion egg unfertilised . A nested process evaluation , use semi-structured interview , focus group discussion stakeholder analysis investigate community acceptability , feasibility give local regional health system structure process , scale-up intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study conduct two setting Kenya contrast epidemiological programmatic characteristic , Kwale County south Kenyan coast Bungoma County western Kenya . Allocation study group cluster , use predefined unit use public health provision - term Community Units ( CUs ) , comprise approximately 1,000 household 5,000 people . CUs randomize one three group , receive either ( ) annual school-based deworming ; ( ii ) annual community-based deworming ; ( iii ) biannual community-based deworming . In nine CUs , longitudinal study conduct order well understand transmission dynamic STH .</detailed_description>
