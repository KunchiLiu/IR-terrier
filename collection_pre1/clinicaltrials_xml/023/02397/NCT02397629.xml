	<detailed_description>This cross sectional study examine relationship serum calcium PTHrP serum PSA men refer prostate biopsy Wake Forest University . Men schedule biopsy approach study nurse explain study invite men participate . After patient provide write consent , she/he obtain following information patient chart : age , race ( self-report , white , black , ) , height , weight ( determination Body Mass Index , variable report influence PSA ) . Blood draw study analytes coordinate routine blood draw PSA test minimize need additional needle stick . A copy informed consent give patient original place file P.I . The biopsy status men time invite participate unknown . Men `` sort '' cancer non-cancer group biopsy read . Serum sample send Department Laboratory Medicine Wake Forest . All assay perform `` house '' . Based consultation urologist , anticipate approximately 30 % biopsy positive ( i.e. , prostate cancer ) . The majority ( approximately 70 % ) negative ( benign ) . Approximately 1-2 % biopsy may classify `` indeterminate '' . Because sufficient number `` indeterminate '' pathology treat separate category , group analyze . However , men `` indeterminate '' biopsy eligible study re-biopsied .</detailed_description>
