	<brief_title>Treatment Post-Surgical Scars With Traditional Ablative Er : YAG Versus Fractional Ablative Er : YAG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Scars common complaint patient presentation dermatology office . To optimize cosmetic result , investigator propose compare erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet ( Er : YAG ) laser therapy two different setting : traditional ablative versus fractional ablative . A side side comparison split scar do evaluate two setting . Fractionated photothermolysis ( fractional setting ) improve field laser surgery allow surgery target microscopic treatment zone ( MTZ ) . MTZ 's allow cylinder damage create laser surgery surround normal , unaffected skin . This act reservoir heal allows microwounds create laser treatment heal quickly minimal discomfort . Objective : To compare efficacy cosmetic appearance scar treat Er : YAG ablative laser traditional ablative resurface set versus fractional ablative resurface setting . Methods : Enroll 20 patient nonsurgical treatment surgical scar . Half scar treat Er : YAG laser traditional ablative setting half scar receive Er : YAG treatment fractional ablative setting . The patient receive 3 treatment monthly interval . They follow 1 2 month treatment . Pictures scar take 45 degree 90 degree angle baseline , treatment , treatment , follow appointment . The patient blind side treat laser set . At end trial , offer chance side felt less improvement treat laser device use contralateral side scar . Results : A panel three blind dermatologist evaluate scar well-established five point grade scale erythema , height texture , overall cosmetic outcome . The mean , standard deviation , kappa value calculate . Patients ask scar evaluation question panel well overall satisfaction , much pain associated procedure , laser prefer , would recommend treatment friend family member .</detailed_description>
