	<brief_summary>The diabetes technology group Imperial College develop bio-inspired artificial pancreas ( BiAP ) system use control algorithm base mathematical model beta-cell physiology . The algorithm implemented miniature silicon microchip within portable handheld device , interfaces component artificial pancreas . Development closed-loop insulin delivery device intensify control without hypoglycaemia extensively review show encouraging result . However , yet prove robust challenge uncertainty external challenge ( mixed meal content , physical exercise , physiological stress intercurrent illness ) people Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) may expose outside clinical environment . The principal research objective ass safety efficacy closed-loop system T1DM compare standard insulin pump therapy ( open-loop ) . The primary outcome study % time spend glucose concentration target range ( 3.9-10.0mmol/l ) . This outcome incorporate safety ensures subject low high glucose excursion principal measure efficacy closed-loop insulin delivery system scientific literature . Other measure outcome % time spend euglycaemia ( 3.9-7.8mmol/l ) , % time spend hypoglycaemia ( &lt; 3.9mmol/l ) , % time spend hyperglycaemia ( &gt; 10mmol/l ) , mean venous blood sensor glucose , glycaemic variability measure standard metric ( Standard Deviation , Continuous Overlapping Net Glycaemic Action , Lability Index , J-Index , Glycaemic Risk Assessment Diabetes Equation , Mean Of Daily Differences , Mean Amplitude Glucose Excursion , Average Daily Risk Range , M-VALUE , Mean Average Glucose ) , glycaemic risk measure Low Blood Glucose Index ( LBGI ) High Blood Glucose Index ( HBGI ) , closed-loop error grid analysis , glucose area curve . All measure previously publish validate . This clinical trial protocol assess artificial pancreas system three separate sub-studies : 1 . In bi-hormonal ( insulin glucagon ) configuration 2 . During exercise bi-hormonal close loop , standard insulin open loop 3 . During meal mixed composition bi-hormonal close loop , standard insulin open loop</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methodology Randomised control cross-over open label study Sub study 1 ( n=10 ) In sub-study 1 include first bio-inspired artificial pancreas study use bi-hormonal ( insulin glucagon ) control fast 6-hour bi-hormonal closed-loop study conduct assess proof concept safety prior 25-hour randomise control crossover study Each subject randomise attend either closed-loop visit open-loop visit first . Once either visit complete subject crossover attend remain visit . Sub-study 2 ( n=20 ) The aim sub-study 2 challenge bi-hormonal pump moderate exercise . Subjects initially randomise either bi-hormonal standard open loop cross . Each study last 25 hour â€¢ Exercise protocol : Subjects connect gas analyser heart rate/ECG monitor per COSMED manufacturer instruction . The oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) /Carbon dioxide production ( VCO2 ) heart rate/ECG trace display continuously real time subject exercise . Warm-up : 3 minute cycle low resistance ( 20-30 watt ) maintain speed 60-80 revolution per minute After warm-up subject undergo 30 minute moderate intensity exercise session bike aim maintain VO2 10-20 % 1st ventilatory anaerobic threshold . If VO2 fall go level resistance increase decrease accordingly . The target VO2 start resistance ( watt ) individually set base baseline exercise test outcome . The estimated time need complete exercise test 35-40 minute . Real-time continuous glucose monitoring alarm set 4mmol/L 15mmol/L audible subject research team . The glucagon solution replace freshly reconstitute glucagon solution every 8 hour throughout closed-loop study If venous blood glucose concentration fall 3.5mmol/L subject experience hypoglycaemia symptom hypoglycaemia confirm additional venous blood plasma glucose sample treat accord Imperial College Hospitals National Health Service Trust Guidelines . After 25 hour closed-loop , 12:00 next day , subject 's insulin pump prim , reconnected start per subject 's usual insulin regime . Once run , close loop system disconnect . The subject eat drink freely may discharge 2 hour , glucose concentration stable . The protocol use subject cross standard open loop 25 hour study remain visit . Sub-study 3 : Bi-hormonal closed-loop control during- mixed meal ( n=20 ) A high fat/high carbohydrate content dinner ( 45g fat , 80g CHO ) give 19:00 , high glycaemic index breakfast ( 40g CHO ) 07:00 high protein/low carbohydrate lunch ( 30g protein,10g CHO ) 12:00 . Subjects free gently mobilise around clinical research unit , smoke permit . Subjects may drink unlimited water throughout visit . Real-time continuous glucose monitoring alarm set 4mmol/L 15mmol/L audible subject research team . The glucagon solution replace freshly reconstitute glucagon solution every 8 hour throughout closed-loop study . If venous blood glucose concentration fall 3.5mmol/L subject experience hypoglycaemia symptom hypoglycaemia confirm additional venous blood plasma glucose sample treat accord Imperial College Hospitals National Health Service Trust Guidelines . After 25 hour closed-loop , 18:00 next day , subject 's insulin pump prim , reconnected start per subject 's usual insulin regime . Once running , closed-loop system disconnect . The subject eat drink freely may discharge 2 hour , glucose concentration stable . The protocol apply cross standard open loop insulin pump remain visit .</detailed_description>
