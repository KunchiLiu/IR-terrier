	<brief_summary>The study evaluate safety efficacy switch MK-1439A ( MK-1439 [ doravirine ] plus lamivudine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ) HIV-1-infected participant virologically suppress protocol-specified antiretroviral regimen . The primary hypothesis switch MK-1439A non-inferior continuation regimen Screening 24 week , assess proportion participant maintain HIV-1 ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) &lt; 50 copies/mL . The Base Study last 50 week . An optional Extension Study evaluate long-term efficacy safety switch MK-1439A additional 2 year .</brief_summary>
