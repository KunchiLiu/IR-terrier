	<brief_title>Study Tolerability Pharmacokinetic ZL-2102 With Investigation Food Effect Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 3 part study . Subjects randomize receive ZL-2102 matching placebo ( 3 : 1 ratio ) Parts 1 Part 3 study . Subjects Part 2 randomize 1:1 receive ZL-2102 possible treatment sequence ( fed/fasted fasted/fed ) . In Part 1 ( ZL-2102-SAD ) , safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics study drug placebo test single dose form capsule give overnight fast . There 7 group . Groups 1 7 total 8 participant group , 56 participant total 7 group . Each group receive different dose study drug placebo follow order strength : 5 , 20 , 60 , 150 , 300 , 500 , 750 mg . Plasma sample collect 0H,0H30M,1H,2H,3H,4H,5H,6H,8H,10H,12H,16H,24H,48H Day 8 . Urine sample collect 0-4,4-8,8-12,12-24,24-28H interval . Subjects confine unit 3 day follow-up observation period 7 day administration . Part 2 study ( ZL-2102-FED ) test effect high-fat meal safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics study drug single dose 12 healthy male subject . Choice dose ZL-2102 make base review blind preliminary safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics data Part 1 . No subject receive placebo Part 2 . Two single dos separate least 7-day wash-out period . One dose give fed ( standardize high-fat breakfast ) one fast condition . Part 3 study ( ZL-2102-MAD ) test safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics study drug repeat dos study drug . Three dose level group ( 9 active 3 placebo ) 12 healthy male subject enrolled.Choice actual daily ZL-2102 dos make base upon review blind preliminary safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics data Part 1 . Three ascend once-daily repeat dose ZL-2102 placebo 14 day , alternatively , twice daily 14 day indicate pharmacokinetics parameter Part 1 ( ZL-2102-SAD ) . If dose need twice daily , total daily dos give half morning half even 12 hour later . Dose administer either feed fasted condition depend blind Part 2 ( ZL-2102-FED ) result . The trial conduct Linear Clinical Research Ltd.by Principle Investigator Janakan Krishnarajah , MD team .</detailed_description>
