	<brief_summary>Obesity major public health issue association insulin resistance greatly increase risk cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes . Exercise training recommend obese population , longitudinal study indicate aerobic exercise training obese individual absence weight loss minimal impact insulin resistance . High turnover fat store within muscle cell ( i.e. , intramyocellular triglyceride ) exercise elevate muscle fitness ( i.e. , muscle oxidative capacity ) key feature enhance insulin sensitivity observe endurance-trained individual . It could longitudinal study exercise train obese individual fail sufficiently stimulate intramyocellular triglyceride turnover exercise muscle oxidative adaptation result failure consider impact recent nutrition within study design . Performing exercise fed vs. fast state blunt exercise responses non-obese individual . The researcher investigate hypothesis acute bout aerobic exercise perform overnight-fasted versus fed-state stimulate great intramyocellular triglyceride utilization exercise enhance expression gene relate muscle oxidative adaptation obese individual . The expect outcome help determine exercise fasted state could use optimise metabolic adaptation train obese individual . The future impact research could recommendation simple nutritional strategy consider meal timing enhance effect aerobic exercise training obese individual , potential long-term benefit reduce insulin resistance cardio-metabolic disease risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two third adult US population overweight obese prevention treatment obesity key priority due strain societal health , well-being economic prosperity . Obesity associate insulin resistance characterize reduce ability insulin stimulate glucose uptake skeletal muscle hyperglycaemia . Obesity insulin resistance major risk factor cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes . Weight loss caloric restriction increase physical activity level mainstay non-surgical/pharmacological treatment obesity . Weight loss reduce insulin resistance although sustainable weight loss difficult achieve . Physical activity help weight maintenance perhaps surprisingly , carefully control longitudinal study obese patient indicate aerobic exercise training absence weight loss best modest impact peripheral insulin resistance . One mechanism regular aerobic exercise training ensure high peripheral insulin sensitivity endurance trained individual via stimulation intramyocellular triglyceride turnover muscle fat oxidation , maintain low muscle level fatty acid metabolite know interfere insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake ( e.g. , fatty acyl CoA , diacyglycerols , ceramides ) . Indirect evidence suggest intramyocellular triglyceride utilized fuel aerobic exercise obese individual , least overnight-fasted state . However , influence overnight-fasted vs. fed-state exercise intramyocellular triglyceride utilization muscle oxidative adaptation study obesity . This important study fed-state exercise , compare overnight-fasted exercise , blunt exercise-associated increase intramyocellular triglyceride utilization , oxidative gene expression , long-term adaptation muscle oxidative capacity resistance high fat diet induce impairment oral glucose tolerance lean individual . Thus , presence timing recent nutrition respect exercise could critical factor explain inability aerobic exercise training per se improve peripheral insulin sensitivity longitudinal study obese population . Exercising overnight-fasted state could optimize metabolic adaptation train obese individual long-term benefit reduce insulin resistance cardio-metabolic disease risk .</detailed_description>
