	<brief_summary>The propose study seek compare diagnostic performance Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) test self-collected sample via Eve Medical self-collection system© ( Eve ) standard physician-collected sample detection cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 worse ( CIN1+ ) cervical cancer among woman refer colposcopy . The performance Eve sample also compare second self-sample via cobas® PCR Female swab . Approximately 1000 adult woman abnormal Pap test level atypical squamous cell undetermined significance worse squamous glandular abnormality ( i.e. , ASCUS+ ) abnormal co-test ( ASCUS+ HPV-positive ) result recruit period 12 month via colposcopy clinic locate Jewish General Hospital , St-Mary 's Hospital , McGill University Health Centers ( Royal Victoria Hospital ) . Participating woman undergo three cervical cervicovaginal sample technique : 1 ) self-sampling use Eve Medical self-collection system© ; 2 ) self-sampling use cobas® PCR Female swab ; 3 ) physician-collected sampling . The participant also fill questionnaire experience convenience acceptability Eve system , relative two sample approach . The decision self-sample collect first dependent randomization HPV test do use cobas® 4800 HPV Test . The liquid medium within cobas® PCR CELL Collection Media provider collect sample cobas® PCR medium two self-collected sample use suspend cellular material prior HPV test . We make collaborative arrangement Dr. Marcel Behr , Chief Department Clinical Microbiology McGill University Health Centre HPV genotyping work . Histology-confirmed CIN1+ form study outcome case definition . Sensitivity , specificity , predictive value ( along respective 95 % confidence interval ) calculate sample type evaluate clinical performance various sample technique . We use CIN1+ definition disease analyse also perform stringent definition , e.g . CIN2+ CIN3/cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After discovery Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection necessary cause cervical cancer much interest introduction novel screen strategy involve HPV DNA test [ 1 ] . HPV DNA test show high sensitivity detect cervical cancer precursor great reproducibility Papanicolaou ( Pap ) cytology screen therefore propose primary screen method future . In high-income country , case cervical cancer continue develop among unscreened under-screened woman [ 2 ] . Factors discourage woman attend routine screen include fear pain discomfort , lack time perceive inconvenience , cultural religious concern , poor socioeconomic status [ 3 ] . For screen program effective high coverage essential thus attendance critical requirement . Because high sensitivity molecular HPV test detect cervical cancer precursor great potential screening coverage increase invite non-attendant provide self-collected vaginal sample . Providing woman simple , convenient , inexpensive mean self-testing may improve cervical screen participation [ 3 ] . Self-sampling also attractive approach assist screen poor country , typically structured cervical cancer screen program bear great burden cervical cancer morbidity mortality [ 4 ] . Self-sampling also enhance value post-HPV vaccination surveillance allow efficient monitoring HPV type distribution population . Finally , self-sampling represent good research tool assist prospective study genital HPV infection natural history cervical neoplasia . Specifically cervical cancer screening , show self-collected cervicovaginal specimen woman receive proper instruction collect yield HPV test result comparable specimen collect physician [ 5-8 ] . Women also prefer self-sampling relative clinician-provided sample , provide assure told properly collect sample [ 8 , 9 ] . Although conceivably loss sensitivity specificity screen cervical cancer specimen directly collect ecto- endo-cervix overall accuracy HPV test result ( identify presence cervical precancerous lesion ) still superior physician-collected Pap smear . Therefore , replace anatomically-correct specimen ( one collect direct visualization cervix primary healthcare provider ) one collect vagina ( thus dilute exfoliated cell wider epithelial surface area ) compensate high sensitivity molecular screening approach [ 6 , 10 , 11 ] . Performance screen seem also unaffected storage transport self-sample swab , irrespective whether kept dry transfer resuspend liquid transport medium [ 10 , 12 ] . A critical feature enhance woman 's acceptance adherence self-sampling approach cervical cancer screen HPV surveillance study convenience device use collection . Dacron polyester swab simple , common , inexpensive . However , inconvenient isolate within sheath prevents contact sample area mucosal surface labia vaginal opening . Ideally , sample device anatomically correct facilitate insertion sample surface retain exfoliate cell protect contact labium lower vaginal mucosa device insert , objective sampling cell mostly cervix upper vaginal area . HPV DNA test use self-collected cervicovaginal specimen represent promise strategy increase cervical screen participation thus reduce rate cervical cancer country establish cervical screening program . Furthermore , approach also greatly improve coverage quality cervical cancer screen develop country , well remote region develop country , e.g. , aboriginal population Northern Quebec First Nations territory . Facilitating improve uptake cervical cancer screen would save life , reduce cost treat invasive cancer potentially reduce inequality avoidable mortality cause cervical cancer .
