	<brief_title>Comparative Evaluation Cocaine Adrenaline Topical Vasonconstrictor Agents Cosmetic Rhinoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective non-randomized study conduct . Female patient undergo cosmetic rhinoplasty include study . All procedure perform two surgeon , ten year experience cosmetic rhinoplasty . One surgeon use cocaine vasoconstrictor agent choice daily practice , whilst adrenaline prefer option . Both practitioner participate surgery , one main surgeon assistant alternatively study conclude . Vasoconstrictor effect cocaine adrenaline assess quantitative qualitative evaluation . Blood loss quantify measure blood aspiration surgery gauze weigh . Aspiration collect graduated bottle ; end surgery fourty cc saline flush suction system . Difference ribbon gauze weight procedure also measure . Adding previous measurement give estimate blood loss . Qualitative analysis vasoconstrictive effect base evaluation surgical field surgeon use linear scale 1 5 ( 1 poor , 5 excellent ) . Systemic effect vasoconstrictor drug assess heart rate ( HR ) systolic/diastolic blood pressure ( SBP/DBP ) variation procedure . Patients monitor continuous electrocardiogram tracing automate blood pressure . Once cocaine adrenaline pack place , measurement take every two half minute first ten minute thereafter every five minute end procedure .</detailed_description>
