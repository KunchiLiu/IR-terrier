	<brief_summary>The purpose study look air quality cab see air quality inside taxi cab connect increased risk lung heart health problem . Another purpose study see put air filter inside car may help improve air quality low health risk . This important air pollution harmful health . Air pollution make tiny particle ( thing ) float air around u , call particulate matter . Particulate matter make dust , smoke , dirt , gas fume get body breathe . It link risk lung cancer heart disease . It important taxi driver spend many hour day inside car . The investigator hope study help find use air filter inside cab help low level pollution cab reduce effect health taxi driver . They use result educate taxi driver community .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DRIIVE ( Data Research Interventions Improve Vehicular Environment ) community-engaged translational pilot project utilize three parallel arm design obtain preliminary data association Particulate Matter ( PM ) /air pollution physiologic measurement biomarkers taxi driver , determine impact HEPA filter ( remove PM volatile organic compound ) intervention physiologic measurement biomarkers . DRIIVE fund New York State Department Health Empire Clinical Research Investigator Program ( ECRIP ) , train physicians clinical research New York . Drivers randomize one two group : Intervention Wait-list Control . The third group Matched Nominated Peer Comparison Group , non-drivers participate PM physiologic biomarker measurement serve control non-driving related PM exposure physiologic response . In total , three group 14 participant recruit : 1 ) Wait List Control group , receive HEPA filter end 1 month participation period , 2 ) Intervention group , receive HEPA filter two week participation period , 3 ) PM reference group peer non-drivers , also receive HEPA filter end 1 month period participation . The project complete within 2 year timeframe .</detailed_description>
