	<brief_summary>Obtaining intravenous ( IV ) access child age 2 year difficult , especially emergency department ( ED ) child frighten , dehydrate ill. Often require multiple needle stick nurse place IV difficult child . In ED recently acquire Accuvein AV400 device . This infrared light , like barcode scanner , make vein child appear like road map . This ideally show nurse place direct needle . This device approve FDA work child show harmful effect . However , study show whether device help difficult less 2 year old see emergency department . This study directly compare place IV child 2 year age AV400 versus use device . A physician , medical student , nurse practitioner train observe nurse place IVs enroll child require IV ED clinical care ( determine ED doctor ) . This person consent parent , ask parent question regard child 's past medical history , nurse look vein child ahead IV access attempt rate level difficulty expect ( easy , moderate , difficult ) . Whether child IV attempt perform without AV400 computer randomize . The nurse attempt place IV , study staff observe record number attempt , size IV catheter , location IV . If 2 attempt fail , patient `` cross '' condition , AV400 use use , AV400 use use . If 4 fail attempt IV placement , child treat per department 's difficult IV access protocol , applied child difficult IV access regardless participation study . After IV placement , parent nurse ask several question regard satisfaction use AV400 . No patient identifier collect . The investigator recruit 260 child determine use AV400 device improve first time needle stick success 40 % 60 % . Nursing approval study obtain prior study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Accuvein Standard IV Access Children 0 24 Months Age Pediatric ED</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize use Accuvein AV400 ( AV400 ) intravenous access improve first attempt success rate intravenous ( IV ) start patient age 0-24 month age 20 % compare standard technique . Study Recruitment protocol - Potential subject patient age 0-24 month recruit pediatric emergency department Harbor-UCLA . The patient screen meet criterion age 0-24 month , require IV access , require emergent resuscitative access , ward state . - Nurses work pediatric emergency department obtain IV access child solicit member research team participate study . All nurse train use device able participate operator study . - The patient enrol subject data collection form fill trained observer . The data collection form contain : train observer level training ; blind nursing number ; randomization number ; patient gender , age month , weight , height , Fitzpatrick skin color , dehydration status , mental status , gestational age , chronic medical condition , hospitalization last two year ; nurse 's assessment vein palpability , visibility , subjective difficulty ; nurse 's pediatric ED experience overall experience year ; access tool whether crossover utilize ; IV gauge , IV access site , number person need assist , whether access successful . All trained observer undergone training ensure reliability observer . Once patient identify potential subject train observer consent obtain , blind randomize manila envelope chosen . The data collection form complete trained observer nurse attempt first IV attempt per arm study ( standard versus AV400 assistance ) . The patient receive two attempt use assigned randomize method . If 2 fail attempt , nurse cross arm study use IV access method . If fails , standard difficult IV access pathway use pediatric ED start . Currently pathway start 4 fail IV attempt . Therefore , additional risk subject study . After IV access successful difficult IV access pathway begin , train observer ask parent nurse series question base Likert scale ass satisfaction whether nurse felt AV400 help find vein , distract her/him usual technique , and/or save time . No identify data collect nurse subject . Trained observer order IV placement , labs medication subject . Potential subject order place IV access prior selection eligibility .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Any pediatric emergency department patient age 024 month require intravenous access . Patients require emergent resuscitation include . Treatment delayed consent patient 's parent . If consent obtain study team timely manner , patient eligible include study . Subjects foster care care state .</criteria>
