	<brief_title>Determinants Early Functional Outcome After Reconstructive Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite positive outcome total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) surgery symptom pain , perceived function health-related quality life ( QoL ) current research highlight persistent deleterious effect retain aberrant neuromuscular alteration physical function , may also directly impact fall risk . Importantly , observed increase neuromuscular deficit occur prior surgery track post-operative stage functional limitation sustain persist least one year surgery . Clearly , crucial strive identify modifiable factor might successfully ameliorate pathophysiological process prior surgery , reduce post surgical impairment also accelerate recovery . Among determinant might contribute towards understand optimal functional recovery follow reconstructive knee surgery influence gene . The evaluation specific genotype subsequent protein expression might provide insight extent genetic influence . For example , yet know whether patient specific genotype experience accelerate recovery . Currently , paucity research influence gene-environment interaction individual 's response physical conditioning . The propose research exploratory study , involve four repeated-measures assessment 10 week prior surgery 12 week surgery . This study offer novel evaluation overall patterning change quantify describe patient-reported objective measure sensorimotor , neuromuscular , psychophysiological performance capability , genotype level habitual physical activity .</detailed_description>
