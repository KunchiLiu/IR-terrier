	<brief_summary>The current method teaching Basic Life Support ( BLS ) course involves practice schedule learner rotate station , without repetition . Laypeople learn within block schedule may experience poor skill retention , result suboptimal delivery Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ( CPR ) . Implementing Contextual Interference ( CI ) practice schedule method BLS training would involve present station multiple time within timeframe .

	<brief_title>Does Contextual Interference Improve Retention Basic Life Support Skills ? A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current BLS course deliver curriculum learner go several basic station sequence organize American Heart Association ( AHA ) . Learners spend fix amount time station , , thus switch task many time number station . This blocked practice design easy implement manage could also contribute factor poor retention BLS skills laypeople ( 11 ) . In next three paragraph , highlight contextual interference beneficial skill retention , contextual interference beneficial medical skill train benefit contextual interference particularly relevant BLS training . Contextual interference ( CI ) practice schedule method involve present skill ( station ) sequential random order . Each skill station present multiple time learn session ( i.e. , perform short duration station , return multiple time ) . Both random sequential order schedule yield comparable learn benefit ( 19 ) . With CI practice schedule , skill partially forget learner practice skill . As result , learner must actively recall skill multiple time . These repeated memory retrieval process facilitate good retention CI practice , compare blocked practice schedule ( 19 ) . A simple analogy make learn multiplication table : one try 7 time 9 , exercise beneficial learn one try 7 time 9 next trial . Having retrieve information multiple time skill ( time ) trial maximize long-term skill retention ( 19 ) . CI also beneficial practice skill distinct ( 12 ) . Because many skill process time , learner must create distinctive memory skill . Altogether , repeat recall contrast involve CI may negative effect immediate performance ( i.e . immediate testing ) , typically positive effect long-term learning ( i.e . retention ) ( 13 ) . More relevant project , positive effect CI extend motor verbal-cognitive domain replicate various skill level learner age group ( 14 ) . Contextual interference show improve long-term learning among engineer train troubleshoot skill ( 15 ) . Although well study sport area outside healthcare , CI le well studied medical education study surgical procedural task . Not implementation contextual interference yield well skill retention transfer compare blocked practice ( 16 , 17 ) . In project , contextual interference carefully test BLS train optimize subtask transition . In surgical procedure , instance , CI study involve break complex sequential task procedure subtasks implement CI practice arbitrarily organize subtasks . An issue approach learner miss opportunity practice transition one subtask another , hinder learning . Conversely , BLS skills station distinct , technically simple , require complex transition skill . The last least relevant factor BLS require transfer skill unpracticed context ( 13 ) . While orthopedic surgery learn perform fairly comparable repeatable condition , BLS learn classroom need transfer wherever cardiac arrest take place . Because contextual interference favour well retention also well transfer new situation ( 20 ) , imperative test practice lead well BLS skill retention transferability conventional blocked practice schedule . The propose study compare skill retention among group laypeople teach BLS use current standard teach program compare expose CI base program . We hypothesize participant train BLS use contextual interference practice schedule superior skill retention retention post-test , 3 month training , compare standard block practice schedule employ current BLS training session . This study single-blinded randomize controlled trial . Ethical approval obtain Ottawa Health Science Research Ethics Board prior recruitment . Written inform consent confidentiality agreement obtain participant .</detailed_description>
