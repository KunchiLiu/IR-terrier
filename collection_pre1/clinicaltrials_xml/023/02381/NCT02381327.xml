The speed eating measure use Mandometer , eat disorder conditioning tool , class 2 device clear FDA treatment eat disorder . Mandometer scale connect computer , patient eat food plate scale computer store weight loss plate , thus record speed eat . Patients decrease speed eat follow training curve computer screen eat . The emergence speed eat screen make possible . Patients use Mandometer lunch dinner one week home estimate speed eat food intake first step clinical pratice . Mandometer program much quickly eat patient practice eat use Mandometer home subsequent treatment . Data 166 BED-patients use Mandometer home total 354 patient treat collect . 30 normal weight , healthy subject recruit test hypothesis speed eat low BED-patients .

	<brief_title>Reduction Speed Eating Intervention Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : control speed eat amount food eaten major intervention Mandometer treatment anorexia nervosa ( AN ) , bulimia nervosa ( BN ) , eat disorder otherwise specify ( EDNOS ) , include binge eat disorder ( BED ) , EDNOS . The control achieve Mandometer , scale connect computer . The patient eat food plate scale computer record weight loss plate course meal . Thus , amount food eat duration meal measure . This yield measure speed eating . Patients also estimate feel fullness regular interval scale Mandometer computer screen computer store rating . Thus , development satiety also measure . AN-patients eat little food long period time . They practice eat food high speed follow training curve computer screen eat . This possible patient see speed eat emerge screen eat adjust speed eat train curve . The patient learn feel full normal manner practice way , assist feedback Mandometer computer screen . Mandometer treatment AN BN evaluted randomize controlled trial , outcome treatment 1428 patient eat disorder six clinic four country report , treatment report effective standard treatment reduce body weight improve health obese adolescent randomize controlled trial . Mandometer clear eat disorder conditioning tool , class 2 device FDA treatment eat disorder . Hypotheses : hypothesize BED-patients eat food high speed normal weight , healthy people . Because compensate increase intake food , BED-patients gain weight become obese . It also hypothesize BED-patients lose weight practice eat less food reduce speed use Mandometer . Aims trial : 166 BED-patients practice eat less food reduce speed home one week total 354 BED-patients ( include 166 patient ) practice eat manner Mandometer treatment eat disorder . This trial aim test hypothesis BED-patients eat high speed normal weight , healthy control subject . The trial also aim examine whether BED-patients lose weight practice eat less food reduce speed . Normal weight , healthy control subject recruit test food intake speed eat home one week meet aim . Patient admission treatment : patient continuously admit Mandometer treatment , standard care eat disorder since 1997 Stockholm City Council . Hence , patient treat accord clinical practice Mandometer Clinic . 20 % patient admitted referral within Swedish Health Care System 80 % self-referral , option within system . 85 % 354 patient woman , age BMI similar men , mean ( SD ) age admission 38 ( 15.4 ) year BMI 37.1 ( 7.5 ) kg/m2 , woman men combine . The marked sex difference expect , patient eat disorder woman . The patient first come clinic instruction use Mandometer home return one week eat examination . While eat home first week use Mandometer part clinical practice , case Mandometer treatment BED launch . Thus , first 354-166=188 patient admit Mandometer treatment eat use Mandometer home enter treatment . Instead , patient eat use Mandometer part initial examination admission . At examination , refer eating examination , patient fill Eating Disorders Inventory , Comprehensive Psychopathological Self-Rating Scale , questionnaires quality life . As part eat examination , patient also examine physician , include blood pressure , heart lung examination , palpation stomach , interview concern medical history history eat disorder . The patientsÂ´ body weight composition examine ( Tanita BC-418 MA ) record recent 24-hour food intake eating habit also take . They diagnose BED use Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders . Intervention : patient instruct use Mandometer first visit clinic give Mandometer use home follow week . They encourage eat food normally eat lunch dinner five day week . 75 % 166 patient six meal Mandometer test . The average amount food time eat thus collect Mandometer load onto Mandobase , custom make database use clinical practice Mandometer Clinic . The data use program Mandometer train curve control eat behavior , i.e. , amount food eat duration meal . The aim Mandometer training patient eat 300-350 g food lunch dinner speed 25-30 g/min . These value correspond previously test normal weight , healthy control subject , ate use Mandometer research laboratory , never home . Patients also provide schedule 24-hour food intake , regularity eat stressed meal snack discourage . Patients return Mandometer Clinic every sixth week measure body weight eat behavior use Mandometer without train curve . The 188 patient use Mandometer home training curve similarly prepare base one test Mandometer , administer part eat examination admit clinic . The patient treat out-patients , come once/week first eight week once/second week . The average number visit clinic 30 year . Quality assurance plan : trained clinician enter data Mandometer Mandobase . Mandometer yield quantitative , valid data , e.g. , amount food eaten ( g ) duration meal ( min ) . These data access researcher clinician get log information qualify use Mandometer . Staff train Mando Academy certify treat eat disorder patient . Mandometer Clinics ISO 9001 14001 certify regular audit . Data check : data check data register . Source data verification : Mandometer data quantitative valid , need external verification . Speed eat among obese subject examine , use questionnaire rather quantitative method . Data Dictionary : measure standard metric , e.g. , kg , g , min . Standard Operating Procedures : Mandobase design ease data entry data collection . Data Mandobase easily export standard statistical program analysis . A system report adverse event operation part clinical practice , part Mandobase . Sample size , number participant necessary demonstrate effect : The female BED-patients ate median speed 44 ( quartile range : 35-53 ) g/min male patient ate median speed 47 ( 41-61 ) g/min week home . Please large variation , make slight sex difference statistically insignificant . Previous test research laboratory demonstrate healthy , normal weight woman men eat average speed approximately 30 g/min . Because 25 pecentile speed eat among female male BED-patients well mean speed eat among previouslty test normal , healthy subject , necessary recruite 20 age-matched , healthy woman 10 men demonstrate effect . The effect appear one week testing . The subject recruit advertisment local train station next campus Karolinska University Hospital , Huddinge . This manner recruitment use several experimental study eat behavior , use Mandometer , normal weight , healthy subject never test home . Also , previously test subject 22 year old subject recruit present trial match age BED-patients , i.e. , 38 year old . A relatively extensive literature indicate , however , eat behavior similar among 20 40 year old human . Even , data control subject necessary test hypothesis present trial . Plan miss data : data obtain 166 BED-patients use Mandometer home 354 BED-patients subesequently use Mandometer treatment ; miss data problem inconsistent data out-of-range result obtain . While thought BN- BED-patients eat large amount food , intake 1900 g food obtain one patient , average intake approximately 430 g hundred test meal BED-patients . Statistical analysis : Variations food intake , meal duration , speed eat display box plot , BMI show mean ( SD ) , change measure measure secondary outcome variable time analyze use ANOVA .</detailed_description>
