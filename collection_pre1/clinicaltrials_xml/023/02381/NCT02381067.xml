	<brief_title>A Prospective Study NuCel® Cervical Spine Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study intend demonstrate NuCel® allograft effective safe promote bone growth fusion rate use cervical fusion patient one , two three-level disease cervical spine . Sixty subject participate study single clinical site . Participants least 21 year age . All subject establish cervical spine disease one , two three level cervical spine require cervical interbody fusion per opinion treat surgeon . The primary objective demonstrate NuCel® comparable autograft bone graft produce successful , contiguous fusion 6 month ±4 week post-operative used cervical fusion surgery . Success base finding cervical CT scan plain radiograph . Additionally , Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) patient satisfaction use secondary outcome measure .</detailed_description>
