	<brief_summary>Scientific study humans suggest diet high fruit vegetable may able improve aspect mental performance improve memory reaction time . One reason improvement may occur compound contain phytochemical may increase blood flow , therefore , delivery oxygen nutrient brain . If case possible measure increase blood flow non-invasive technique call Near Infrared Spectroscopy . The purpose study examine effect fruit juice cerebral blood flow cognitive function</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigate Effect Tart Montmorency Cherry Juice ( Prunus Cerasus ) Cerebral Blood Flow Cognitive Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each participant require attend laboratory three occasion . The first initial screening/training visit , within 14 day first active study visit . During initial visit participant provide write informed consent screen regard study exclusion/inclusion criterion . Training give cognitive task familiarisation study procedure provide . Study day : Forty - eight hour prior study day , participant begin dietary restriction . Participants attend first study day follow overnight fast . A cannula insert baseline blood sample obtain , baseline measure cerebral blood flow examine use near infrared spectroscopy effect cognitive function use cognitive demand battery . The relevant drink provide blood sample blood flow measure take hourly interval ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 5h ) . No additional food drink provide study period except low-nitrate mineral water . After minimum 2 week , participant ask return lab repeat procedure drink . Cerebrovascular Responses Cerebral oxygenation assess use near - infrared spectroscopy . Two near-infrared sensor place skin right leave prefrontal cortex region forehead , signal average determine cerebral oxygenation . The sensor secure skin use double-sided adhesive tape shield ambient light use elastic bandage . The sensor alternately emit near-infrared light wavelength 730 810 nm . Each sensor contain two detector locate 3 4 cm emit source detect oxygenate deoxygenated state Hb estimate regional O2 saturation base internal algorithm ( Rasmussen et al . 2007 ) . Blood velocity middle cerebral artery ( MCAV ) determine use transcranial Doppler sonography . A 2 MHz Doppler probe position right middle cerebral artery use previously describe search technique ( Aaslid et al . 1982 ) secure adjustable headset ( DiaMon , Compumedics DWL ) . The mean depth Doppler signal 51 Â± 3 mm . Arterial blood pressure record transducer locate heart level ( TruWave , Edwards Lifesciences , Nyon , Switzerland ) .</detailed_description>
