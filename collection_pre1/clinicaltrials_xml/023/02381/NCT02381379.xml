	<detailed_description>Chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm signify presence Philadephia chromosome , derivative chromosome 22 translocation chromosome 9 22 . The Philadephia chromosome produce mutate tyrosine kinase ( BCR-ABL1 ) , initiate pathogenesis disease . Imatinib first tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , change treatment paradigm CML since approval U.S. Food Drug Administration 2001 treatment CML . It signify new era oncological treatment use target therapy . Subsequent generation TKIs market potent therapy CML . Tyrosine kinase inhibitor conventionally think able cure CML take life . It able induce deep molecular response ( MR ) 10 % CML patient evidence persistent undetectable ≤0.0032 % ( International Scale IS ) BCR-ABL1 transcript quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test current molecular assay , label MR4.5 . However patient continue take TKIs per recommendation European Leukaemia Net current practice institution Malaysia . Long term treatment cumbersome , concern chronic side effect long term tyrosine kinase inhibition financial burden country ' health budget drug expensive . Current available data show 40 % CML patient prior stable MR4.5 2 year able stay imatinib-free least 2 year . About 13 % patient without confirmed molecular relapse study criterion low persistent BCR-ABL1 remain imatinib-free median follow-up 22 month ( range 6 - 35 ) . A patient confirm molecular relapse study criterion remain drug free follow-up . This postulate component immunity suppress leukemic clone . Interferon standard treatment CML era TKI . As single agent , induce complete cytogenetic response ( CCR ) 20 % , non-sustainable deep MR 10 % patient early chronic phase . These much small figure compare TKI . Imatinib dose 400mg daily induces CCR 70 % deep MR 10 % patient chronic phase one year treatment . However , interferon-responded patient may indeed retain response interferon withdrawn via interferon-induced immunity towards leukemic clone , lead long drug free period compare TKI . Hence , logical postulate use interferon TKI stop patient attained deep MR two year increase percentage patient remain TKI-free follow-up . Unfortunately , many study concern matter . Carella et al described case series five patient deep MR range 12 41 month , put interferon follow-up range three 16 month . Recently , study Japan , nine 12 analyzable patient include 3 patient previous treatment interferon , stop TKI , put interferon remain deep MR median follow-up 23 month ( 6-27 month ) . In regard peginterferon , small study Hardan I et al describe 11 CML patient various response imatinib ( complete cytogenetic response N=3 , major molecular response N=6 , deep MR N=2 ) put peginterferon-α-2a nine month together imatinib , imatinib stop continue peginterferon-α-2a another three month . It difficult draw conclusion paper small number subject , two subject achieve deep MR ( unknown duration ) study entry , peginterferon-α-2a combine imatinib nine month cloud true effect peginterferon-α-2a imatinib stop . So far , randomize study compare interferon administer fix duration TKI stop versus observation see whether percentage duration CML patient remain TKI-free increase prolonged interferon , respectively . It interest see long group give interferon remain TKI-free . If remain TKI-free long duration , suggest interferon-induced immunity , also suggest interferon-induced immunity induce low level leukemic cell present . Economical wise , TKI-free certainly give big relief limited health budget on-growing CML population .</detailed_description>
