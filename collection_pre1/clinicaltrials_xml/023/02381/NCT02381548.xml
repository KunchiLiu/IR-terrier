	<brief_title>Phase I Trial AZD1775 Belinostat Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Myeloid Malignancies Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) regimen combine WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 ( AZD1775 ) belinostat patient refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , chronic myeloid leukemia blast crisis ( CML-BC ) , intermediate-2 high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , select previously untreated poor-prognosis patient AML . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe toxicity regimen . II . To observe record anti-tumor activity . III . If response observe , determine relationship , , exist response tumor protein 53 ( p53 ) /fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ( FLT3 ) mutational status . IV . To describe pharmacokinetic ( PK ) interaction , , AZD1775 belinostat . V. To test feasibility perform correlative study involve leukemic blast obtain pre-treatment 24-hours post-treatment determine event associate vitro synergism ( eg , down-regulation phosphorylated [ p ] -Wee1 p-checkpoint kinase 1 [ Chk1 ] ; dephosphorylation cyclin-dependent kinase-like 1 [ cdc2 ] tyrosine [ Tyr ] 15 threonine [ Thr ] 14 ; increase expression gamma H2A histone family , member X [ H2A.X ] p-histone H3 [ HH3 ] ) recapitulate follow exposure AZD1775 belinostat patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive belinostat intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute daily ( QD ) day 1-5 8-12 WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 orally ( PO ) QD day 1-5 8-12 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) , complete remission incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi ) , cytogenetic complete remission ( CRc ) , molecular complete remission ( CRm ) go stem cell transplant may continue treatment 3-4 additional course response . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day respond patient follow every 2 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
