	<brief_summary>This multi-center prospective observational study design track birth outcome perinatal correlate Panorama prenatal screen test general population among ten thousand woman present clinically elect Panorama microdeletion aneuploidy screen part routine care . The primary objective evaluate performance Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ( SNP ) -based Non Invasive Prenatal Testing ( NIPT ) 22q11.2 microdeletion ( DiGeorge syndrome ) large cohort pregnant woman . This do performing review perinatal medical record obtain biospecimens birth perform genetic diagnostic test 22q11.2 deletion . Results follow-up specimen compare obtained Panorama screen test determine test performance . Specific test performance parameter include : PPV , specificity , sensitivity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective determine prospective study performance SNP base NIPT 22q11.2 microdeletion ( DiGeorge syndrome ) large cohort pregnant woman clinically opt form screening . Specific test performance parameter include : positive predictive value ( PPV ) , specificity , sensitivity . Secondary objective include : 1 . Determine test performance ( PPV , specificity ) SNP base NIPT detect microdeletion syndrome available Panorama microdeletion panel ( e.g. , 1p36 deletion , Cri-du-chat , Prader-Willi , Angelman ) individually combine ( include 22q11.2 ) . Given incidence &lt; 1:5000 , confidence interval expect large . 2 . Determine failure ( 'no call ' ) rate Next-generation Aneuploidy Test Using SNPs ( NATUS ) method 22q11.2 detection , well aneuploidy . 3 . Determine whether precise risk aneuploidy generate set low fetal fraction incorporate maternal BMI ( adjust fetal fraction percentile ) . 4 . Assess whether low fetal fraction associate specific ultrasound finding may indicate aneuploidy ( e.g . triploidy , trisomy 13 18 ) . 5 . Investigate relationship NIPT sonographic ( nuchal translucency anatomy survey ) marker serum marker 1st 2nd trimester aneuploidy screening . 6 . Determine sensitivity , specificity , PPV chromosomal aneuploidy sex chromosome abnormality . 7 . Perform detailed assessment false positive aneuploidy sample well understand source error , include placental study refine issue surround mosaicism NIPT represent circulate placental DNA . 8 . Investigate relationship circulate placental DNA ( fetal fraction ) test parameter include potential genotypic marker , outcomes relate abnormal placentation ( include limit preeclampsia , small gestational age morbidly adherent placenta ) . 9 . Investigate risk factor may impact risk assessment microdeletions include sonographic finding consistent 22q11.2 ( cardiac anomaly thymus size ) .</detailed_description>
