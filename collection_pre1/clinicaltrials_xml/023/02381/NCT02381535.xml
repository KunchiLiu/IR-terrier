	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose heat shock protein-90 ( Hsp90 ) inhibitor AT13387 give together intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) cisplatin treat patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck spread start nearby tissue lymph node . Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 work block protein call HSP90 . HSP90 help protect cell stress support many protein cause cell growth . When HSP90 block , tumor cell growth may slow stop may die easily treat chemotherapy radiation . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . IMRT specialized radiation therapy delivers beam radiation different intensity aim tumor many angle may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Giving Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 cisplatin IMRT may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) AT13387 ( Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 ) combination concurrent cisplatin radiotherapy patient locoregionally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( LA-SCCHN ) . ( Dose Escalation Phase ) II . To preliminarily evaluate safety preliminary efficacy AT13387 combination concurrent cisplatin radiotherapy patient LA-SCCHN . ( Dose Expansion Phase ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacokinetics AT13387 combination cisplatin radiotherapy . II . To evaluate pharmacokinetics cisplatin combination AT13387 radiotherapy . III . To assess pharmacodynamics biomarkers proof-of-mechanism . IIV . To assess potential predictive biomarkers efficacy . V. To document toxicity associate administration AT13387 combination cisplatin radiotherapy patient LA-SCCHN . VI . To explore characterize predictive biomarkers individual cancer patient utilize genomic sequencing technology . VII . To provide preliminary disease-free survival , locoregional control , distant metastases-free survival , overall survival . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 . Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day -7 , 3 , 10 , 24 , 31 , 38 cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 . Patients also undergo IMRT daily ( QD ) , 5 day week 7 week total 35 fraction . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 8 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year . Beyond first 2 year , patient may follow every 6 month 3 year per institutional standard .</detailed_description>
