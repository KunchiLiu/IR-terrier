	<detailed_description>SUMMARY Over past 30 year , childhood overweight/obesity , often begin infancy toddlerhood , reach epidemic proportion , particularly among minority and/or low-income population high-income country . Rates pediatric obesity ( BMI ≥ 95th percentile ) almost triple past 25 year , current estimate show prevalence rate 16 % girl 18 % boy . The prevalence adolescent childhood overweight obesity child live Egypt , Brazil Mexico reach level comparable see industrialized nation . Obesity associate alteration iron metabolism lead iron deficiency probably prevalent single common micronutrient deficiency world today . Aim study : 1 . To assess iron status among overweight/ obese primary school child . With age range 6 year till preadolescence age 12 year Tanner score ≤ 2 . 2 . To assess effect 6 month diet program iron status improvement overweight/obese child . 3 . To study psychological basis obesity child well associate co-morbidities . 4 . To assess prevalence obesity among primary school student . The study conduct 2 group : Group 1 1025 recruit 2 urban primary school moderate-high social standard among child age 6 12 year . Weight , height measure body mass index calculate . All measure plot percentile age . The percentage obese overweight child calculate . Group 2 include 150 child , 100 obese child 50 normal weight child age range 6 12 year . All 150 subject subject : 1 . A questionnaire : inquiring personal data , Socioeconomic data , family history obesity , weight related attitude , physical exercise performance , personal believe diet ( self-efficacy , barrier change dietary believe ) , previous trial lose weight school performance . 2 . Full clinical examination : include 1 . Systemic examination blood pressure measurement . 2 . Anthropometric measurement include weight , height body mass index . 3 . Laboratory investigation : complete blood picture , serum iron , ferritin , transferrin saturation , total iron binding capacity , soluble transferrin receptor , serum triglyceride serum cholesterol . All obese child subject weight reduction program include diet regimen , exercise behavioral modification . All anthropometric laboratory measure measure 6 month intervention .</detailed_description>
