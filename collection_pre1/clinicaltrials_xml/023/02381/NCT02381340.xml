	<brief_summary>Obesity associate condition reach epidemic proportion . Estimates one third adult United States obesity . At moment many therapeutic approach treatment obesity . But , efficacy treatment option limit far surgical intervention proven strategy overcome severe obesity . However , bariatric surgery limitation risk , might minimize non-incisional endoscopic procedure . BaroSense develop new device , call Articulating Circular Endoscopic ( ACETM ) Stapler , use treatment obesity . It trans-oral procedure , intend reduce ability stomach expand create plication region fundus great curvature . In contrast bariatric surgery endoscopically perform , reversible fails future surgical option still open . The main study ( 'Open , prospective study evaluate safety preliminary effectiveness BaroSense ACE™ Stapler treatment obesity ' , multicenter study ( MUMC+ , AMC St. Antonius ) , accept MEC AMC ) seek determine safety efficacy plicate system patient severe obesity . In sub-study want unravel exact mechanism provide information efficacy BaroSense ACE™ Stapler . Therefore measure change various parameter know affect weight loss metabolism , gastric plication ( use BaroSense ACE™ Stapler ) overweight subject ( parameter measure patient MUMC+ ) . These parameter post-prandial satiety , food-reward related brain signalling , gastric emptying , behaviour towards food , food intake , satiety hormone release , microbiota composition inflammatory marker . Objectives : Aim present study assess effect BaroSense ACE™ stapler postprandial satiety , food-reward related brain signalling , gastric emptying , behaviour towards food , food intake , hormone release , microbiota composition inflammatory marker .</brief_summary>
