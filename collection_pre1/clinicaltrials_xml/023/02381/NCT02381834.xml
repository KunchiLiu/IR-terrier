	<brief_summary>Urinalysis urine culture commonly employ laboratory test Emergency Department ( ED ) , particularly purpose investigate febrile infant bacterial etiology must rule . The standard care obtain sterile urine specimen age group remain transurethral bladder catheterization , invasive procedure painful potential cause specimen contamination iatrogenic urinary tract infection ( UTI ) . A recent study Herreros Fernández et al ( 2013 ) describe novel bladder stimulation technique newborns facilitate midstream urine collection . The success rate procedure 86.3 % . It remain unknown however whether technique reproducible amongst infant present ED potentially great severity illness . The primary objective study determine success rate technique child ≤ 90 day old ED .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two person ( least one trained nurse [ RN ] physician [ MD ] and/or one health care aid [ HCA ] ) require perform procedure , one also measure time critical step protocol use stopwatch . The technique involve combination fluid administration non-invasive bladder stimulation manoeuvre include gently finger tap abdomen without low back massage . The first step involve bottle breastfeed infant amount milk appropriate weight age . Breastfed baby history poor feed feed ad libitum . Those feed poorly encourage supplement feed either express breast milk formula discretion parent/guardian . Formula feed infant receive 10 ml fee first day life , increase 10 ml per day age maximum 70 ml per feed . For infant great 7 day old , 25 ml/kg administer per feed . Babies demonstrate mild clinical dehydration and/or fail attempt oral feeding may , discretion responsible physician ( MRP ) , peripheral intravenous ( IV ) catheter place receive fluid bolus 0.9 % normal saline maximum 10-20 ml/kg give 20-25 minute . Infants exclude feed well . Approximately 20 minute feed IV fluid bolus , infant 's genitals clean sterile technique use 0.05 % chlorhexidine . Non-pharmacological analgesia , achieve soother and/or 24 % sucrose offer prevent lessen cry . The second major step technique involve hold infant axilla leg dangle safely crib mattress . An RN MD begin bladder stimulation gently finger tap low abdomen midline pubic symphysis frequency 100 tap per minute . If step unsuccessful 30 second , RN/MD stimulate lower back lumbar paravertebral zone lightly massage area circular motion use thumb . This perform maximum 30 second . The two stimulation manoeuvre repeat succession ( maximum 5 minute , 5 cycle ) micturition occur midstream urine sample caught sterile container . Infants spontaneously urinate cleaning , prior bladder stimulation , clean catch urine send lab . These case consider successful `` non-invasive '' attempt . Infants fail produce urine feeding/fluid administration bladder catheterization discretion MRP .</detailed_description>
