	<detailed_description>The propose study evaluate efficacy 6-month , child care-based intervention increase worker ' MVPA health-related behavior ( Healthy Lifestyles ) compare attention control condition ( Healthy Finances ) . This study use two-arm , cluster-randomized control trial ( RCT ) sample 104 child care center 416 worker ( 4 workers/center ) . The primary outcome worker ' MVPA ; secondary outcome include worker ' weight , dietary intake , smoke status , sleep habit , emotional health well child care center ' program , policy environment around worksite wellness teacher ' interaction child around physical activity . All primary secondary outcome assess baseline , post-intervention ( 6 month ) , maintenance ( 18 month ) . For study , 104 child care center recruit mix urban/suburban rural area . Potential child care center county identify use online database license child care facility maintain North Carolina ( NC ) Division Child Development Early Education . State local community partner engage help inform center target county research study . Direct recruitment center employ variety strategy ( e.g. , mail , email , telephone , website , video , in-person contact ) . Once center express interest , center director engage recruit staff ( child care worker ) participate team . Outcome Measures : A series measurement collect participate child care center director staff three time point - baseline , follow-up ( 6 month ) , maintenance ( 18 month ) . Primary outcome measure assess moderate vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) center staff . Secondary outcome measure assess staff member ' behavioral health risk factor well center ' program , policy environment around worksite wellness teacher ' interaction child around physical activity . These measure collect one-day , on-site visit child care center , supplement physical health assessment complete kick-off event . Center visit conduct research assistant undergone extensive training certification measurement procedure blind study-arm assignment . Similar data collection protocol use three time point - baseline , follow-up maintenance . Randomization : Centers randomly assign ( 1:1 ) intervention control arm . Randomization occur local kick-off event ( center must attend one event ) . Each kick-off event include short wellness fair morning ( include station collect baseline biomedical health assessment ) . Lunch provide , follow random assignment either intervention control arm . Timing allow baseline measure complete prior randomization . Centers intervention control arm immediately start implementation respective program . Program Details/Intervention : Healthy Lifestyles Intervention kick educational workshop tailor feedback base response CHART assessment tool . The educational workshop personalize health assessment summary deliver afternoon kick-off event group format participate center . Following launch , intervention provide 3 campaign , include follow component : center support material , director webinar , staff magazine , behavioral goal setting/monitoring weekly personalize feedback . The center support material , director webinars , staff magazine deliver directly center support center-based intervention . The behavioral goal setting/monitoring deliver directly participate staff . While campaign structure constant , topic campaign vary . Campaign 1 focus increase daily physical activity , cut back unhealthy snacking , switch sugary diet drink water . Campaign 2 focus eat diet rich fruit vegetable , whole grain , lean protein , vary daily physical activity , increase strength training . Campaign 3 focus maintain active lifestyle , manage stress healthy way , improve sleep habit . Program Details/Control : Healthy Finances Intervention kick-off educational workshop personalize health assessment snapshot kickoff community event . The educational workshop deliver afternoon kick-off event group format participate center randomize Healthy Finances arm . The personalized health assessment snapshot provide workshop , review detail . It intend provide basic comparison current behavior recommendation . Following launch , intervention provide 3 campaign , include follow component : director webinar , staff magazine , contest focus quiz knowledge gain magazine . The director webinars staff magazine deliver directly center support center-based program . The contest knowledge quiz deliver directly participate staff . While campaign structure constant , topic campaign vary . Campaign 1 focus link financial health personal well-being ( physical , mental ) , record-keeping : logging income expense , thoughtful spending : create stick spending plan . Campaign 2 focus create make personal saving account , benefit long-term investing : rule thumb pick investment . Campaign 3 focus understanding credit report credit score , understand good credit , tips strategy improve credit . Analysis : Investigators compare difference mean change MVPA baseline post intervention Healthy Lifestyle Healthy Finance arm , control baseline physical activity . The primary analysis test hypothesis intent-to-treat principle use Generalized Linear Mixed Models ( GLMM ) account correlation induce clustering staff within center . Each GLMM include random intercept center ( β 0 ) fix effect baseline value primary outcome ( β1 ) intervention ( β2 ) test difference mean change primary outcome zero β0 fix intercept e error . [ Change Primary Outcome6mo = β0 + β1PrimaryOutcomebaseline + β2Intervention + b0 + e ] Including baseline score covariate analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) , case GLLM ANCOVA analysis , powerful test group comparison baseline post-intervention change . Additionally , ANCOVA distort regression towards mean bias , whereas change analysis . To explore intervention effect , investigator fit GLMMs : 1 ) adjust baseline covariates , consider priori , relevant change MVPA ; 2 ) adjust baseline variable distribute differently Healthy Lifestyle Healthy Finance arm ; 3 ) test interaction term treatment group covariates ; 4 ) examine completers . While investigator make every effort minimize attrition center participant level ; drop expect . Investigators explore potential bias non-ignorable , non-response use two method : 1 ) compare respondents non- respondent see differ systematically value non-missing variable ; 2 ) ass whether data miss completely random ( MCAR ) , miss random ( MAR ) miss random ( MNAR ) - non-ignorable . If miss data ignorable ( MAR and/or MCAR ) , investigator consider impute miss endpoint data use multiple imputation technique . However , often hard determine miss data ignorable ; therefore , investigator consider selection model ( MNAR model ) ass data miss random estimate effect intervention remove selection bias . Investigators also consider use pattern mixture model assess sensitivity result various assumption miss data pattern . Investigators ' previous work child care center worksites demonstrate good retention .</detailed_description>
