	<brief_summary>Chronic constipation strong public health problem . Its prevalence 15 % Western country significant impact quality life health care cost . Two subtypes constipation identify : slow transit constipation ( STC ) , characterize impaired propulsion stool due dysfunction colonic smooth muscle ( myopathy ) innervation ( neuropathy ) , ; evacuation disorder , characterize difficulty inability stool expulsion . They include disorder anorectal function dyssynergic defecation , well structural disorder rectocele , descend perineum syndrome rectal prolapse . The first line therapy chronic constipation base medical treatment combine laxative dietary rule . However , treatment often disappoint . In case failure , treatment option currently available . Surgery sometimes discuss intractable chronic constipation . Sub-total colectomy propose case STC associate significant morbidity . In case pelvic floor disorder , specific surgical treatment indicate . However , surgery invasive , significant morbidity result inconsistent . Recently , study assess efficacy sacral neuromodulation treatment chronic constipation success , technique expensive require surgical implantation medical device . More recent work , include randomize trial show , child , efficacy interferential current stimulation treatment chronic transit constipation . This treatment use daily , home , use four adhesive surface electrode , two abdominal ( placed costal margin ) two paraspinal ( place T9 L2 ) produce two sinusoidal current cross body , 1 hour per day 1-3 month . To date , one open-label study evaluate technique adult show encouraging result three month efficiency 7/11 patient ( 63.6 % ) number stool , severity score constipation , quality life 's score associate improved bowel transit time measure radio-markers . Interferential therapy new treatment demonstrate efficiency treatment chronic constipation child . Our team publish first pilot study adult also demonstrate encouraging result . These data particular interest since laxative treatment often disappointing , expensive may adverse event . This study would first randomize study evaluate non-invasive non-pharmacological treatment chronic constipation adult . If effectiveness demonstrate , provide , first time , new non-invasive step patient laxative treatment failure consider surgical treatment .</brief_summary>
