	<brief_title>G-202 Neoadjuvant Setting Followed Radical Prostatectomy Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More one-third patient localize high-risk prostate cancer undergo radical prostatectomy eventually relapse distant disease data suggest neoadjuvant treatment patient population may helpful . This study base prodrug tumor targeting , inactive form toxic agent administer systemically get activate specific location body , result high concentration cytotoxic form tumor location . G-202 prodrug activate prostate cancer tissue blood vessel tumor , normal tissue ; activate , G-202 lead disruption intracellular calcium level subsequent induction apoptosis . Thus , G-202 expect bring cell death prostate cancer cell destroy blood supply prostate tumor . G-202 lead disease stabilization patient , drug evaluate neoadjuvant setting . This single-arm , open-label Phase II clinical trial evaluate safety activity G-202 patient localize high-risk prostate cancer prior radical prostatectomy . Through effect neovasculature tumor , G-202 anticipate disrupt blood supply prostate tumor , result decrease perfusion subsequent tumor volume . The primary endpoint study evaluation G-202 perfusion volume prostate use non-invasive multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging ( mpMRI ) .</detailed_description>
