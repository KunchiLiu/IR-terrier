	<detailed_description>ABSTRACT : This clinical trial registration focus Aim 4 within overall project describe follow . Prostate cancer ( PCa ) common cancer among men U.S. One important strategy address public health concern prevent disease . Two large randomize clinical trial , The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial ( PCPT ) The Reduction Dutasteride Prostate Cancer Events ( REDUCE ) , demonstrate 23-25 % reduction PCa risk use 5 alpha reductase inhibitor ( 5ARIs : finasteride dutasteride ) . However , 5ARIs widely adopt due , part , poor cost-effectiveness . We hypothesize targeted chemoprevention , base 1 ) overall genetic risk [ family history ( FH ) PCa risk-associated genetic variant ] , 2 ) polymorphism interact 5ARIs , may efficacious cost-effective , thus likely employed physician patient . The effectiveness genomic-targeted approach need systematically evaluate compare non-genomic approach use evidence-based method recommend EGAPP ( Evaluation Genomic Applications Practice Prevention ) work group . We assemble multidisciplinary research team address overarch question whether genomic-targeted approach improve outcomes related chemoprevention PCa use 5ARIs compare non-targeted approach . We evaluate compare efficacy , perception , decision making , cost-effectiveness genomic non-genomic approach two exist large randomized clinical trial ( REDUCE PCPT ) , two new study population men risk PCa , survey physician . The unique study design REDUCE PCPT , end-of-study prostate biopsy , allow u address two critical question study : PSA detection-bias PCa risk-associated SNPs efficacy genomic-targeted chemoprevention PCa use 5ARIs . We follow specific aim : 1 ) ass clinical validity PCa risk prediction model use panel non PSA detection bias PCa risk-associated SNPs . 2 ) identify assess clinical validity novel polymorphism interact 5ARIs reduce PCa diagnosis use genome-wide candidate gene approach , 3 ) ass clinical utility genomic-targeted approach compare reduction rate PCa non-targeted chemoprevention , 4 ) compare perception decision make physician patient genomic non-genomic-targeted chemoprevention PCa , 5 ) Compare cost-effectiveness genomic non-genomic-targeted chemoprevention PCa . Results study provide comprehensive data evidence-based evaluation Center Disease Control 's EGAPP work group , provide proof principle study comparative effectiveness research ( CER ) , help build road map future genomic personalize medicine ( GPM ) 21st century .</detailed_description>
