	<brief_title>Ropidoxuridine Treating Patients With Advanced Gastrointestinal Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To conduct phase I dose escalation trial , determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , oral ( po ) IPdR ( ropidoxuridine ) give daily 28 consecutive day concurrent intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) patient advance gastrointestinal cancer treat palliative radiation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe record anti-tumor activity . II . To establish pharmacokinetics daily po dose IPdR x 28 day . III . To assess , patient treat MTD , biochemical evidence IPdR effect normal tissue ( circulate granulocyte ) tumor tissue ( patient accessible tumor tissue ) measure % iododeoxyuridine ( IUdR ) -deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) cellular incorporation flow cytometry high-pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) analyse . V. To assess use % IUdR-DNA cellular incorporation ( measure investigational laboratory assay flow cytometry HPLC ) exploratory biomarker IPdR follow effect : % IUdR-DNA tumor cell incorporation day 8 tumor biopsy gastrointestinal ( GI ) cancer patient receive MTD dos IPdR exploratory biomarker tumor radiosensitization use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . VI . To assess use % IUdR-DNA cellular incorporation ( measure investigational laboratory assay flow cytometry HPLC ) exploratory biomarker IPdR follow effect : % IUdR-DNA cellular incorporation patient ' circulate granulocyte take weekly 28-day IPdR MTD dose , day 29 , week 8 exploratory biomarker IPdR systemic toxicity bone marrow measure complete blood count ( CBC ) /differential value . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ropidoxuridine . Beginning 30 minute 2 hour radiation therapy , patient receive ropidoxuridine PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning day 8 , patient undergo IMRT 5 day week 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
