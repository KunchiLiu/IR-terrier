	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate briefly stop blood flow patient 's leg lead patient 's body well able tolerate possible decreased blood flow region brain otherwise frequently happen subarachnoid hemorrhage . Previous study show various organ heart , brain kidney tolerate long period decrease blood flow prior insult short period decrease blood flow experience .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Remote Ischemic Pre-conditioning Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rupture brain aneurysms common cause death disability , account many 10 % stroke case United States . While much result injury nervous system cause initial bleeding aneurysm , many patient develop cerebral vasospasm , pathological constriction blood vessel supply brain , several day follow hemorrhage . As many third patient suffer result neurological deficit stroke , presumably cause decreased blood flow brain ( ischemia ) . This delayed brain injury account significant percentage poor outcome follow aneurysm rupture . Remote ischemic preconditioning transient limb ischemia ( produce inflation blood pressure cuff arm leg ) show minimize ischemic injury organ , notably heart . This `` remote ischemic preconditioning '' promise protect brain ischemic injury . Whereas form stroke onset ischemia predict general population , follow aneurysm rupture investigator know patient 's risk develop vasospasm . Therefore , ischemic preconditioning follow aneurysm rupture may help prevent ischemic injury cause vasospasm . One small study show decrease vasospasm metabolic product ischemia patient treat remote ischemic preconditioning subarachnoid hemorrhage . Decreased vasospasm due remote ischemic preconditioning brain follow aneurysm rupture still need validated question remain show mortality morbidity benefit . Remote Ischemic Preconditioning ( RIPC ) Procedure : Following enrollment , computer generate randomization do see patient get RIPC sham-RIPC procedure . Patients receive four cycle low limb remote ischemic preconditioning , start early post-hemorrhage day . The remote ischemic preconditioning typically take place post-hemorrhage day 2 - 12 . Each cycle RIPC consist four 5-minute cycle low limb ischemia follow 5-minute period reperfusion . A large manual bedside blood pressure cuff wrap around upper thigh one leg . The cuff inflate pressure 20 mm Hg great systolic arterial blood pressure measure patient 's arterial line upper limb blood pressure cuff . The adequate level inflation confirm absence pulse ipsilateral pedal artery detect Doppler . The cuff remain inflated 5 minute . The cuff deflate limb allow re-perfuse least 5 minute . After cuff deflate , procedure repeat three time total four cycle . Patients receive sham-RIPC procedure cuff inflate pressure 20 mmHg low systolic , hence occlude blood flow cause ischemia . The rest study conduct similarly group . Research staff aware patient sham treatment group . Patient , nurse , treat physician , lab technician Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) technician make aware patient receive sham treatment procedure . Evaluation Tolerance RIPC Maneuvers : The patient continuously monitor pain discomfort RIPC session . If patient pain 6 traditional 1-10 scale patient express desire stop maneuver , procedure stop , data regard number duration maneuver record . A down-escalation treatment propose , reduce number cuff inflation 3 2 , tolerate . Hemodynamic evaluation effect RIPC Maneuvers : Intracranial pressure ( bolt external ventricular vein ( EVD ) present ) , blood pressure , oxygen saturation heart rate monitor pre-conditioning process . If heart rate BP change great 20 % baseline attribute anything else precondition stop allow normalize retry abort base bedside nurse , physician , research staff discretion . Oxygen saturation also need 92 % time ICP &lt; 20 start discretion bedside nurse physician . Glascow Coma Score ( GSC ) monitor nursing staff record per ICU protocol . ( TCD ) measurement perform per ICU protocol . Clinical assessment patient perform daily discharge ICU per protocol . Modified Rankin Scale perform research staff arrival , Day 14 , discharge , telephone 1 6 month . Data gather patient ' chart include location aneurysm , intervention perform , Hunt &amp; Hess score , Fisher grade determine CT-head , PT/PTT/INR , chemistry CBC ( standard care lab ) . Also information regard ICU length stay , hospital length stay , Transcranial Doppler measurement , GCS stay , mortality demographic data gather ( include age , sex , race , prior admission Rankin score ) .</detailed_description>
