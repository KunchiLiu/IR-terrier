	<detailed_description>Study Aims Specifically Healthy Weight Management patient pursue sleeve gastrectomy surgery , investigator would like determine Fitbit associated health outcome population . Primary Outcome • Percentage excess weight loss - Does use Fitbit positively affect percentage excess body weight loss vertical sleeve gastrectomy patient ? Secondary Outcomes - Lifestyle change Exercise pattern - Does use Fitbit foster positive lifestyle exercise pattern change post-operative VSG patient ? - Resolution comorbidity - Does use Fitbit positively affect patient health via reduction co-morbid condition associate morbid obesity follow VSG surgery ? Research Methodology This study focus bariatric post-surgical population design randomize control trial ( RCT ) three arm ; RCT control intervention group historical control group . For RCT , subject , provide informed consent , randomize either control arm intervention arm . In control arm , subject provide normal/standard care post-surgical bariatric patient . This include physician visit , dietary exercise consults , education therapy appropriate care . In intervention arm , subject provide Fitbit bracelet software monitor physical activity addition normal/standard care provide control group . Both group receive recommend aerobic strength training exercise guideline . Furthermore , group identical exercise education regard appropriate intensity use either rate perceive exertion target heart rate range . At end 12-month tracking period study , control group provide Fitbit bracelet begin track activity level 2nd post-operative year . A third group , historical control , end study extract electronic medical record patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion surgical patient complete follow-up prior start RCT portion trial . RCT subject randomize intervention group provide step step instruction set-up Fitbit app smartphone view data Fitbit secure portal . Additionally , subject show track weekly structure aerobic strength training exercise within app . Users also show access Fitbit data MyLGHealth portal . Data Fitbit also accessible provider EPIC flow sheet . Providers able incorporate data discussion patient visit . RCT subject randomize control group receive train Fitbit device complete 12 month visit . Just prior start RCT , conduct pilot study test implementation Fitbit patient population . The pilot phase initially target 5 patient enroll test set-up Fitbit monitoring , data transfer , activity log data collection procedure . Subjects pilot phase participate period 1 month individual receive Fitbit device . The investigator employ inclusion/exclusion criterion , recruitment procedure complete data collection procedure ( baseline follow-up ) plan randomize trial . If additional adjustment need make relative Fitbit set-up training/reference material patient , another 5 pilot patient may recruit . Data collection study procedure pilot subject complete randomized trial begin . This pilot study submit IRB review approval separate study prior RCT portion study . For RCT portion study , subject recruit , enrol randomize study baseline data collect entered study database . These data element include subject demographic ( age , gender , weight enter program , preoperative weight , comorbidities , lifestyle physical activity pattern , etc. ) . Subjects follow one year lose follow-up data collect physician office visit . At office visit , investigator extract Epic date visit , subject weight comorbidities . Lifestyle physical activity pattern assess 2 week , 1 month , 4 month , 8 month 12 month visit . The historical control group extract end study RCT subject nearing completion 12 month follow-up . The historical control consist group patient already receive surgery complete 12 month follow-up prior start pilot RCT portion project . There interaction part study . The investigator plan identify collect data end RCT portion project .</detailed_description>
