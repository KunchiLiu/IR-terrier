	<brief_summary>Combined spinal-epidural analgesia ( CSEA ) sometimes use difficult birth , whether contributes postpartum pelvic muscle disorder unclear . This randomize controlled trial examine whether CSEA affect electrophysiological index postpartum pelvic floor muscle labor . The investigator plan recruit 300 primiparous healthy woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Labor analgesia relieve labor pain , reduce stress reaction , improve blood supply fetus , benefit mother baby . Though traditional epidural analgesia use 40 year , combine spinal-epidural analgesia ( CSEA ) become popular provide faster-onset pain relief minimal motor weakness . CSEA may also accelerate cervical dilation . Despite popularity CSEA , whether associate short- long-term beneficial adverse effect mother remain unclear . One question whether procedure affect risk female pelvic floor disorder ( PFD ) , pelvic floor muscle injure . These muscle responsible support pelvic organ stabilize rhythmic , strong labor contraction diaphragm contract enough generate pressure 19 kPa . Numerous risk factor associate PFD , include obesity , diabetes , old age , connective tissue disorder , neurological disease , pregnancy , vaginal delivery childbirth . PFD lead turn stress urinary incontinence , overactive bladder , pelvic organ prolapse fecal incontinence , strongly reduce woman 's physical psychological health . Pelvic floor function analyze measuring strength degree fatigue pelvic floor muscle , well pelvic dynamic pressure . Abnormalities indicators appear even patient complain sign symptom PFD , make useful early diagnostic index . In randomize controlled study , examine whether CSEA affect postpartum pelvic floor muscle function primiparous mother give birth vaginally , well duration different stage labor . Our result help establish whether widespread use CSEA provide benefit mother pose risk .</detailed_description>
