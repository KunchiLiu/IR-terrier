	<detailed_description>The study prospective , randomize , double blind placebo-controlled trial . The study population include male female , age 18-65 , fulfill criterion primary DSM-5 OCD determine structure interview . At screening , patient must YBOCS score ≥20 MADRS score ≤18 . If deem eligible , patient provide stool sample microbiome profile blood sample inflammatory marker analysis . They return first visit clinician self-rated symptom severity scale complete patient begin randomly assign treatment condition probiotic ( Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 Biﬁdobacterium longum R0175 ) placebo . Contents two sachet ( probiotic placebo ) consume daily breakfast . The participant attend 3 additional study visit , every 4 week one phone visit week 6 . During visit , clinician self-reported questionnaire complete . At week 6 , patient contact phone complete YBOCS also provide midpoint stool sample . At final visit ( week 12 ) patient provide third stool sample microbiome profile blood sample inflammatory marker analysis . Participants assess use Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) determine whether criterion primary OCD diagnosis meet alongside additional comorbid disorder . Participants complete number clinician self-rated symptom severity scale list : 1 . Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale ( YBOCS ) - Clinician-rated 2 .

Patients weigh height measure determine body mass index ( BMI ) . Those meet study criterion provide collection kit instruct appropriate fecal sample collection . Participants also give lab requisition instruct blood drawn local lab . This blood sample examine serum level IL-6 , IL-1β , IL-10 , IFNγ , TNF- α CRP . Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry ( LC-MS ) use kynurenine/tryptophan analysis . Fecal Sample Collection Patients healthy control collect fecal sample home use well-established protocol . During recruitment visit , subject provide kit contain single 50-ml sterile vial air-tight sachet , Oxoid Anearobic kit cool pad . The patient instruct transfer several gram feces vial lid completely tight , place vial airtight sachet , tear Oxoid sachet , place airtight sachet seal . This enable u good preserve anaerobic bacteria . The sample transport cool pad , previously place freezer . To transfer stool sample MacAnxiety Research Centre , subject contact study personnel local taxi company , deliver stool sample clinic within four hour defecation . The stool sample process anaerobic chamber . Part stool sample transfer two 5 ml cryovials mix correspond amount Ringer-cysteine solution 10 % glycerol store -80ºC freezer . The part sample transfer two , 2-ml cryovials snap frozen use liquid nitrogen molecular analysis microbiota . The visit organize follow : 1 . Baseline Visit ( visit 1 ) : blood stool sample collect patient randomize probiotic placebo treatment . At visit patient begin randomly assign treatment condition probiotic ( Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 Biﬁdobacterium longum R0175 ) placebo . The patient provide 60 sachet ( probiotic placebo ) instruct consume 2 daily sachet breakfast . At follow visit provide additional 60 sachet . In visit clinician also complete follow scale : . Clinical Global Impression - Improvement ( CGI-I ) - Clinician-rated ii . Clinical Global Impression - Severity ( CGI-S ) - Clinician-rated iii . Y-BOCS iv . MADRS Participants complete follow scale : - Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised ( OCI-R ) - Depression Anxiety Stress Scale ( DASS-21 ) - Dutch Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale ( DDOCS ) - Sheehan Disability Scale ( SDS ) - Q-LES-Q - short form 2 . During 12 week period probiotic treatment , subject attend 3 additional visit , every 4 week . During visit ( visits 2-4 ) participant assess study physician . In visit clinician also complete follow scale : . Clinical Global Impression - Improvement ( CGI-I ) - Clinician-rated ii . Clinical Global Impression - Severity ( CGI-S ) - Clinician-rated iii . Y-BOCS iv . MADRS Participants complete follow scale : - Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised ( OCI-R ) - Depression Anxiety Stress Scale ( DASS-21 ) - Dutch Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale ( DDOCS ) - Sheehan Disability Scale ( SDS ) - Q-LES-Q - short form 3 . At week 6 , patient provide midpoint stool sample per sample collection protocol outline . A member research team also contact patient via telephone complete YBOCS . 4 . Visit 4 ( week 12 ) : Participants undergo usual assessment , treatment response also determine visit ( CGI-I score ≤ 2 well 30 % drop YBOCS score ) . Participants also complete Quality Life Enjoyment Satisfaction Questionnaire . Patient diet assess use EPIC-Norfolk Food Frequency Questionnaire . At visit 3 , participant provide collection kit instruct appropriate fecal sample collection ( outline ) . The sample collect prior day visit 4 . Blood sample draw draw local lab examine level IL-6 , IL-1β , IL-10 , IFNγ , TNF- α CRP . Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry ( LC-MS ) use kynurenine/tryptophan analysis .</detailed_description>
