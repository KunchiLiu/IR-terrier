	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint . The primary endpoint study evaluate safety identify side effect TheraGauze/tobramycin wound pack compare standard care management cutaneous abscess require incision drainage . Methods . Design : This proof-of-concept , prospective , randomized clinical trial safety TheraGauze-tobramycin adult subject present Emergency Department setting care skin abscess require incision drainage . A control , standard care , arm include provide data respect side effect profile current furunculosis management comparison . Two arm propose study : 1 . Incision + TheraGauze+tobramycin packing ( systemic antibiotic ) 2 . Incision + standard iodoform wick plain cotton wick packing ( ± p.o . antibiotic ) Anti-microbial TheraGauze ( saturate tobramycin solution 3 mg/ml ) pack drained wound subject study arm . The control arm receive current standard care wound pack choice iodoform wick plain cotton wick , base preference ED physician . After pack , wound excess TheraGauze wick cut away . The ED physician option prescribe oral antibiotic , accord preference . The following oral antibiotic choice available subject control arm : - Bactrim ( TMP/SMX ) - Vibramycin ( doxycycline ) - Cleocin ( clindamycin ) Antibiotics purchased subject local pharmacy . TheraGauze-tobramycin . We plan use TheraGauze saturate tobramycin 3 mg/ml , dose use ophthalmic preparation ( e.g. , Tobrex ) much small concentration concentration tobramycin bone cement ( 50 - 60 mg/ml ) . The decade efficacy safety tobramycin eye drop justifies use 3 mg/ml concentration . In vitro test TheraGauze/tobramycin ( 0.9 mg/ml ) , show excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial activity Gram-negative Gram-positive bacterial pathogen include clinical MRSA strain test ( Echague , Hair et al . 2010 ) . We expect &gt; 85 % cutaneous abscess ( furuncle ) infect MRSA ( Demos , McLeod et al . 2012 ) . Additionally , tobramycin non-absorbable antibiotic thus excellent choice achieve local antimicrobial activity minimal risk systemic side effect , common antibiotic bone cement . The TheraGauze/tobramycin wound packing place incision drainage abscess remove day 3 ( ± 1 ) follow visit Emergency Department . TheraGauze/tobramycin place wound single time . Methods : Study Population : Subjects Hampton Roads region southeastern Virginia recruit hospital emergency department site staff EVMS physician Sentara Norfolk General Hospital . Study Size : We anticipate screen 200 patient order enroll randomize 100 subject . Subjects randomize 2:1 TheraGauze+tobramycin iodoform wick/ plain cotton wick , respectively . We anticipate 50 participant complete study . The 50 % retention rate typical emergency department population . Recruitment Retention : Subjects present Emergency Department set care skin abscess require incision drainage approach on-site Study Coordinators enrollment . Upon meet eligibility criterion willingness participate , subjects/LARs provide inform consent . A medical information release obtain subject outcome data collect related additional unscheduled visit adverse event care outside emergency department set . Women minority participation : Adults 65 year age enrol regardless gender minority status long fluent English . Randomization : A study subject identification number assign . Subjects sequentially randomize one two treatment arm upon enrollment 2:1 ratio , use prepared list . Study Treatments Visit 1 - Day 1 : - Informed consent obtain subject . - Review Eligibility Criteria ( Inclusion/Exclusion ) - Randomization Treatment Arm - Contact Information include phone number ( ) , address , primary care provider collect . - Treatment discharge instruction return ED revaluation per routine care . The typical schedule patient return ED 2 day initial wound care ( Study Day 3 ±1 ) . The following information collect record hard copy Case Report Form visit . • Subject ID number • Demographics • Medical history • Characteristics symptom history - Abscess characteristic - Procedure information - Laboratory Assessments - Per standard clinical care abscess content send routine Gram stain , bacterial culture susceptibility test . - If patient receive iodoform wick/plain cotton wick care provider option prescribe p.o . antibiotic , frequently do clinical setting . Phone Follow Contact Day 2 Return visit reminder wound status follow perform Sentara Study Coordinator . • Questions sign symptom underlie infection possible side-effects wound pack oral antibiotic . Visit 2 - Day 3 ±1 : ( ED ) Subjects ' wound status evaluate . The following information collect record hard copy Case Report Form visit : - Questions infection - Bacterial burden wound bed - Wound culture perform use quantitative method culture wound base ( Gardner , Frantz et al . 2006 ) . - Wound assessment - Schedule follow-up visit EVMS Clinical Research Unit 5 ± 1 day Phone Follow Contact Day Prior CRU visit : Return visit reminder perform Study Coordinator . Same question Day 2 . Visit 3 - Day 7 ± 1 : ( EVMS Clinical Research Unit ) : Follow subject ' wound status . The following information collect record hard copy Case Report Form contact . • Questions infection - Wound assessment Statistical Analysis Plan The data analyze use SAS 9.4 software . All statistical test two-sided significance level 0.05 . Patients withdraw treatment include data analysis time point withdrawal . Baseline follow-up measurement safety , tolerability , number pathogenic bacteria , wound infection persistence worsening , gross effect rate wound heal summarize use descriptive statistic mean , median , standard deviation , interquartile range , frequency , percentage appropriate . Normality assessments continuous variable complete use Shapiro-Wilk test stem-and-leaf plot . Tests equivalence TheraGauze + tobramycin standard iodoform wick pack treatment group establish statistical significance two-sided 90 % confidence interval difference fall within limit ( -δ , δ ) , δ margin clinically accept difference . This analysis determine whether outcomes equivalent TheraGauze+tobramycin standard iodoform wick pack treatment group . Protection Human Subjects : This research involve recruitment , enrollment management human subject participate research . Adults age 65 year enrollment study adult commonly suffer skin abscess . Study oversight investigator assure compliance regulatory requirement Institutional Review Board approval prior initiation study , obtain annual re-approval study activity . Potential risk benefit subject procedure mitigate risk : • Physical/Medical - Serious/Adverse Events - report EVMS IRB - Confidentiality/PHI - All PHI maintain encrypt password protect electronic file . ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY Subjects must see physician appropriately train healthcare professional every study visit , evaluation must document . Adverse Events . An AE untoward medical occurrence clinical investigation subject administer pharmaceutical product necessarily causal relationship treatment . An AE therefore unfavorable unintended sign ( include abnormal laboratory finding , example ) , symptom , disease temporally associate use medicinal product , whether consider related medicinal product . Causality Assessment . For AEs , PI provide assessment causal relationship study drug . Causal relationship must assess answer follow question : Is reasonable possibility study drug cause event ? Adverse Reaction . An AE assess likely causal relationship intervention ( i.e. , TheraGauze/tobramycin ) . Specifically focus local-toxicity adverse reaction , evaluate increase redness , increase pain new rash site pack wound . Increasing pain redness could due progression infection ( cellulitis/abscess ) local toxicity reaction tobramycin TheraGauze/tobramycin packing . This assessed Investigator . Increasing purulent drainage identification new area fluctuance require additional incision drainage procedure assess progression infection rather evidence local toxicity reaction tobramycin . Severity Assessment . The PI must provide assessment severity AE record severity rating , assess describe . Severity , description intensity manifestation AE , distinct seriousness , implies subject outcome AE-required treatment measure associate threat life functionality . Guidelines Adverse Event Severity Assessments Mild . Minor awareness sign symptom easily tolerate without specific medical intervention . Moderate . Discomfort interfere usual activity may require minimal intervention . Severe . Significant sign symptom incapacitate inability work perform routine activity and/or require medical intervention . Serious Adverse Events . An SAE untoward medical occurrence dose : life threatening , require in-patient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization , result persistent significant disability/incapacity . Important medical event may consider serious , base appropriate medical judgment , may jeopardize subject may require medical surgical intervention prevent one outcomes listed definition . If serious unexpected AE occur evidence suggest causal relationship drug event event must report serious unexpected suspect adverse reaction . SAE report local IRB FDA within 5 calendar day . Stopping Rules . Adverse reaction , include local-toxicity adverse reaction , SAEs lead immediate return SNGH ED assessment removal TheraGauze/tobramycin wound pack . The investigator assess need treatment adverse reaction SAE , necessary , either treat refer treatment , appropriate . The subject continue schedule follow : Day 3 visit ED , Day 6 phone follow , Day7 visit EVMS Clinical Research Unit .</detailed_description>
