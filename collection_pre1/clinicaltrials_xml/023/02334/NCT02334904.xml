	<brief_summary>Significant change brain morphology observed people first-episode psychosis . Studies show total brain volume particular brain structure decrease people psychosis disorder . Recent evidence suggest atypical antipsychotic drug maintain increase brain volume . Thus , plan use MRI scan measure change brain morphology subject recently diagnose bipolar psychosis disorder take atypical antipsychotic drug aripiprazole risperidone . Secondary objective include take blood sample fast metabolic index neuropsychiatric measure comparison drug treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Aripiprazole Versus Risperidone Brain Morphology Using MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study use direct measure brain volume matter ( mean MRI ) determine differential effect aripiprazole risperidone brain morphology participant first-episode psychosis . A secondary objective see fast metabolic index measure blood ( i.e . glucose , insulin , total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , triglyceride , adiponectin leptin ) also correlate change brain morphology symptom severity ( measure neuropsychiatric assessment ) .</detailed_description>
