	<brief_summary>This study carry assess equivalence scar outcome two absorbable suture use wound closure face dermatologic surgery : rapidly absorbable polyglactin 910 ( VicrylRapideâ„¢ ) fast-absorbing plain gut ( 5-0 fast ) . This important absorbable suture commonly use Mohs surgery epidermal closure , yet evidence indicating suture allow well cosmetic outcome ( less erythema , edema , scar ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective randomize controlled split-scar observer-blinded study . After dermatologic surgery face , surgeon choice use non-absorbable absorbable suture skin closure . A dermatologic surgeon favor absorbable suture wound closure consider many factor material selection , include ease manipulation , cost , absorption time . However , randomized trial compare important measure : aesthetic/cosmetic outcome . Study endpoint/outcome : use three validate scar assessment tool .</detailed_description>
