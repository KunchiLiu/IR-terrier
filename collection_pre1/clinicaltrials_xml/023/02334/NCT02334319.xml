	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well ganetespib work surgery treat patient stage I-IVA squamous cell carcinoma head neck remove surgery . Ganetespib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Studying sample blood tissue laboratory patient receive ganetespib may help doctor learn effect ganetespib cell . It may also help doctor understand well patient respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ganetespib Window Opportunity Study Head Neck Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ganetespib small molecule inhibitor HSP90 currently study several ongoing clinical trial . Investigators demonstrate ganetespib sensitizes colorectal cell line effect chemo radiotherapy vitro . Ganetespib may anti-tumor effect head neck cancer . The investigator propose pilot study first step examine activity ganetespib patient locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) plan surgical resection . Ganetespib investigate SCCHN . This protocol window opportunity trial look whether rationale pursue agent future development clinical trial would focus therapeutic intervention without radiotherapy . There therefore clinical trial currently open use ganetespib SCCHN list ClinicalTrials.gov . It clear patient receive drug prior surgery benefit intervention . In study , ganetespib administer twice weekly ( dose approximately 72 hour apart ) 2 week , follow surgery day last dose study drug . There 3 dose level , 80 , 100 150mg/m² high dose . These dos choose base following consideration . In Phase 1 study ( protocol 9090-01 ) investigate twice-weekly ganetespib treatment schedule , dose 173 mg/m² well tolerate , manageable diarrhea fatigue common adverse event . Extensive correlative study pharmacokinetic ( PK ) /pharmacodynamic ( PD ) model preclinical data suggest human effective dose range ganetespib 70-150 mg/m² . Therefore , 80 mg/m² within range ganetespib effectiveness 150 mg/m² twice weekly well-tolerated dose .</detailed_description>
