	<brief_summary>After surgery , risk venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , include Deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT ) major vein legs Pulmonary Embolus ( PE ) lung . These clot usually prevent administration low-molecular-weight heparin , blood thinner prevents clot . In surgical specialty like thoracic vascular surgery , treatment use patient discharge hospital . However , orthopaedic surgery , strong evidence long term preventative treatment 35 day hospital discharge help reduce VTE occurrence . In thoracic surgery , even great risk develop PE surgical stress , common presence cancer direct damage blood vessel lung surgery . Despite potential utility , use extend VTE prevention never evaluate thoracic surgery population . If extend treatment prevents clot , patient avoid complication related VTE . There currently limited information available incidence venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) patient undergo lung cancer resection utility extend thromboprophylaxis ( ET ) patient population . Furthermore , contrast patient undergo orthopaedic surgery ET become standard care , duration thromboprophylaxis well defined patient population . Therefore , clear need systematically evaluate effect extend VTE prophylaxis incidence VTE post-op population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There currently limited information available incidence venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) patient undergo lung cancer resection utility extend thromboprophylaxis ( ET ) patient population . Furthermore , contrast patient undergo orthopaedic surgery ET become standard care , duration thromboprophylaxis well defined patient population . Therefore , clear need systematically evaluate effect extend VTE prophylaxis incidence VTE post-op population . As pilot study , primary outcome involve feasibility measure . The investigator aim measure proportion recruitment within centre , compliance , loss follow-up , tolerability intervention , define number severity per-defined adverse event . The primary outcome interest future full-scale trial 30-day incidence rate VTE follow extend 30-day prophylaxis ( defined pulmonary embolus deep venous thromboembolism lower limb detect CT ( Computed Tomography ) pulmonary angiography full leg Doppler ultrasound , respectively ) follow lung resection malignancy . The propose pilot project multicenter blind placebo-controlled randomized control pilot clinical trial assess feasibility effectiveness extended-duration VTE prophylaxis ( 30 day post-operatively ) vs. short-term prophylaxis restrict in-hospital stay outpatient inject placebo , patient undergo lung resection lung cancer metastatic disease . All patient receive peri-operative dose follow postoperative VTE prophylaxis duration hospital stay . Those randomize prolonged prophylaxis continue dosage regime overall 30 day , whereas control group receive placebo injection duration time .</detailed_description>
