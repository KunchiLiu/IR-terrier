	<brief_summary>Background : - Malaria severe infection cause parasite . People get malaria mosquito carry parasite bite . Malaria infection happen United States , many people Africa , Asia , South America risk . Researchers want test two vaccine may help decrease malaria infection . Objective : - To see two vaccine ( Pfs25M-EPA/Alhydrogel Pfs230DIM-EPA/Alhydrogel ) safe human cause immune response prevent malaria parasites correctly grow mosquito . Eligibility : - Healthy adult age 18 50 . Design : - There several group study . Each group receive different dose vaccine group receive vaccine . - Vaccinations give two day 4 week apart . - Participants receive vaccine injection arm . Blood drawn day vaccination . - In 4 week receive vaccination , participant least 3 clinic visit 1 phone contact . They least 3 visit 3 phone contact next 6 month . - At visit , participant evaluate side effect vaccine new health change problem . They ask feel take medicine . Blood urine sample may take visit . More follow-up visit may need follow change problem .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A vaccine interrupt malaria transmission would valuable tool local elimination eradication disease . Pfs25 Pfs230 , surface antigen zygotes ookinetes mosquito stage Plasmodium falciparum , lead candidate malaria transmission block vaccine . Recombinant Pfs25M recombinant Pfs230D1M conjugate Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoProtein A ( EPA ) adjuvanted Alhydrogel . This dose-escalating phase 1 study determine safety immunogenicity vaccine US adult subsequently Malian adult . A total 260 subject enrol site US Mali receive escalate dos Pfs25M- EPA/Alhydrogel , Pfs230D1M-EPA/Alhydrogel , simultaneous Pfs25MEPA/Alhydrogel Pfs230D1M-EPA/Alhydrogel . Enrollment within group stagger additional safety , subject enrol simultaneous administration group individual dose administer review safety . Subjects follow least 6 month last vaccination . Safety outcomes local systemic adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) . Immunogenicity outcomes antibody response measure ELISA recombinant Pfs25 , Pfs230 , EPA , B cell response . Functional activity induce antibody assess membrane feed assay conduct National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases US .</detailed_description>
