	<brief_title>MR-PET Staging Assessment Operability Ovarian Cancer - Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , academic hospital Maastricht invest integrate MR-PET system ( Biograph mMR , Siemens Healthcare , Erlangen , Germany ) , ready use routine clinical application . Applications system numerous various type cancer , include ovarian cancer , could benefit possibility . The whole-body MR-PET system integrate strength MRI PET within single examination . MRI provide anatomic detail stag local tumor extent due high soft tissue resolution advance functional technique DWI enhance local distant lesion detection characterisation . PET image complement structural functional information molecular imaging technology useful stag adenopathy metastatic spread . These characteristic contribute wide spectrum possible clinical oncological application , primary tumor detection local distant staging , selection patient neoadjuvant therapy assessment response chemotherapy finally evaluation recurrent disease . The importance select patient ovarian cancer benefit either primary debulking surgery neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow interval debulking surgery acknowledge worldwide optimal diagnostic modality serve matter remain discover . We believe combine magnetic resonance image positron emission tomography ( MR-PET ) great clinical value preoperative staging patient ovarian cancer . Both positron emission tomography ( PET ) , compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) prove useful ovarian cancer stag understaging due difficulty depict peritoneal dissemination remain great problem . In conclusion , best method stag ovarian cancer assess operability remain discover , hence study .</detailed_description>
