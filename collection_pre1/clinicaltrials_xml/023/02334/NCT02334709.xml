	<brief_summary>Tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) often used standard treatment patient metastasize renal cell carcinoma . In addition ability specifically inhibit tumor growth , TKIs also interfere vascularisation tumor . Unfortunately , patient obtain long-lasting clinical benefit treatment . The goal current study enhance effect TKIs combine stereotactic radiotherapy treatment one metastases . This type radiotherapy allow u precisely irradiate tumor minimal effect surround healthy tissue . Recently demonstrate type radiotherapy stimulate immune system attack tumor . By combine stereotactic radiotherapy TKIs expect observe reduction metastasis big population patient . In first part study focus safety combination therapy . In second part evaluate combine treatment response .</brief_summary>
