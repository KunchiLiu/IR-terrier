	<brief_summary>Many child every year present Emergency Department ( ED ) The Royal Children 's Hospital ( RCH ) cellulitis ( skin infection ) . If mild , child go home oral antibiotic treatment . If complicate severe , child admit hospital intravenous ( IV , drip ) antibiotic treatment . There middle group uncomplicated moderate/severe cellulitis require IV antibiotic acutely unwell . In order determine whether effective child uncomplicated moderate severe cellulitis receive antibiotic treatment home ( via Hospital-In-The-Home ) receive antibiotic treatment hospital , need conduct large study randomly assign child receive either HITH hospital ward care . The primary research question address : In child moderate/severe uncomplicated cellulitis , failure rate 2 day follow first dose antibiotic non-inferior child treat IV antibiotic home compare failure rate 2 day follow first dose child treat IV antibiotic hospital ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Adults cellulitis commonly IV antibiotic administer outpatient , whereas child admit hospital . Based small amount literature , know child moderate/severe cellulitis also safely treat home.This study include child uncomplicated moderate/severe cellulitis therefore demonstrate whether child uncomplicated moderate/severe cellulitis effectively treat home . If study demonstrate effective treat child home , potential impact child family 's quality life ( QOL ) well hospital resource management . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To compare failure rate IV antibiotic treatment child treat home ( iv ceftriaxone ) treat hospital ( iv flucloxacillin ) first 2 day treatment follow first dose give ED child moderate/severe cellulitis ( Moderate/severe : define study , assess ED doctor need iv antibiotic ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES To compare : Time progression cellulitis Time discharge : number day ( include fraction day ) time arrival ED time patient longer need hospital-based interventions/care , whether hospital home Readmission rate Representation ED Length stay ED Duration IV antibiotic Rates IV cannula need least one resiting Complications cellulitis : development abscess require drainage start IV antibiotic , bacteraemia Adverse event Microbiology : - Rate ceftriaxone susceptibility bacteria isolate nasal skin swab affect area - Rate S. aureus nasal carriage ( methicillin-sensitive methicillin-resistant ) collect within 48 hour , 7-14 day , 3 month 1 year start antibiotic - Rate resistant bacteria present stool sample collect within 48 hour , 7-14 day , 3 month 1 year start antibiotic . Rates clinical infection resistant organism 1 year start antibiotic Differential effect narrow spectrum ( flucloxacillin ) broad spectrum ( ceftriaxone ) nasal gastrointestinal microbiome nasal swabs stool sample collect within 48 hour , 7-14 day , 3 month 1 year start antibiotic . Costs hospital versus HITH treatment : include cost bed , consumables , nurse medical time , overhead include administrative time , information technology , use hospital car Quality life ( QOL ) indicator Clinical assessment cellulitis term presence systemic feature , surface area affect ( long length axis multiply long perpendicular axis measure cm2 ) , severity swell ( judged clinician one following : mild , moderate severe ) , intensity erythema ( judged clinician scale 0 5 , 0=no erythema 5=severe whether function affect area impair STUDY METHODOLOGY ED clinician ( senior doctor , junior doctor nurse practitioner ) identify patient moderate/severe cellulitis present RCH ED , point triage clinical assessment . The consent randomization , data collection follow part routine practice . Randomisation location treatment essential difference normal clinical practice . Where parent give consent , ED clinician make decision patient treat . INTERVENTIONS Although propose study intervention treat child home , currently , base prospective observational study , 50 % child uncomplicated moderate/severe cellulitis already send home ED clinician receive daily IV antibiotic home . The new intervention randomisation process provide high level evidence practice become standard practice ED . The researcher ED clinician access randomization software perform randomisation process . Patients randomise HITH prescribe iv ceftriaxone ( 50mg/kg daily ) per current practice randomise ward prescribe iv flucloxacillin ( 50mg/kg 6 hourly ) . On insertion IV cannula , ED clinician obtain blood culture . If skin breakdown , skin swab would do per routine clinical practice . Prior commence IV antibiotic . In addition , researcher ED clinician ask parent take 2 photo cellulitis area use camera/phone ( available ) affect area demarcate indelible ink tape measure place along side area affect . This helpful review doctor follow day judge whether improvement . The first dose antibiotic commence ED . For child assign hospital ward treatment , child transfer ward IV infusion continue . Children assign HITH complete first dose ED go home . The management point per usual practice . The responsible ward doctor review make management decision patient admit ward whereas HITH registrar review patient HITH . The research assistant ( RA ) ( paediatric registrar ) meet child parent ( ) within 24 hour consent obtain answer question parent participant may study . Currently , guideline start IV antibiotic cellulitis . The investigator ' recommendation provide section 'Inclusion criterion ' reflect consensus among RCH ED clinician . Some patient require IV antibiotic may recruit exist group . A nasal swab stool sample request four different time point : 1 ) within 48 hour first antibiotic dose ; 2 ) 7-14 day start antibiotic ; 3 ) 3 month start antibiotic ; 4 ) 1 year start antibiotic . At time point , additional information collect : previous overseas travel , previous hospital admission , household member admit hospital overseas , antibiotic use , infection , medical visit hospital admission . These sample optional affect participation study . As per normal practice , patient switch oral therapy 2-4 day IV antibiotic , clinical improvement cellulitis . Based current prospective study , HITH patient ward patient switch oral antibiotic reduction fever , swell , erythema improvement function affect area ( eg . Previously limp , walk ) . Once change oral antibiotic ( per RCH clinical practice guideline ; cephalexin 25mg/kg 6 hourly , total dose may combine divided twice daily ) , patient usually discharge hospital care normally follow hospital . In study , investigator offer participant follow clinic 7-14 day ( RA paediatric registrar ) discharge hospital . Parents request bring stool sample patient clinic review mandatory .</detailed_description>
