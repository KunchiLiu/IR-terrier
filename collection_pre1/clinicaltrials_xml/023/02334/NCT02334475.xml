	<brief_summary>Chronic low back pain , without low extremity pain , arise various structure spine constitutes majority pain complaint . The sacroiliac joint ( SIJ ) implicate primary source pain 10 % 27 % patient mechanical low back pain L5 vertebra . The common cause SIJ pain include trauma like direct fall buttock , rear-end broad-side type motor vehicle accident , unanticipated step hole miscalculate height , fusion surgery , anterior dislocation , inflammatory degenerative sacroiliac joint disease idiopathic . The treatment SIJ pain remain therapeutic challenge . Besides physiotherapy systemic therapy include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) biologic agent , intra-articular peri articular injection SIJ , radiofrequency neurotomy surgical fusion often perform pain relief . However , success intervention determine accord therapeutic efficacy correct placement drug . The image guidance SIJ injection seem important due complex anatomy joint cause low accuracy perform accord clinical judgement . The feasibility ultrasound ( USG ) guide injection SIJ recently demonstrate result high success rate 90 % . Various agent use SIJ injection include local anaesthetic , corticosteroid , botulinum toxin-A , 12.5 % dextrose , phenol-glycerine-glucose ( P2G ) sodium morrhuate ( cod liver oil extract ) . SIJ steroid injection commonly use technique find effective treat SIJ pain . However , main drawback short term effect . Borowsky et al report improvement visual analog score ( VAS ) 14.1 % reduction VAS â‰¥ 50 % 12.50 % patient 3 month intra-articular steroid ( 2 mL 0.5 % bupivacaine plus 40 mg methylprednisolone ) SIJ injection . Treatment modality currently use , general , address disease process , clearly need investigate treatment widely applicable symptom management may also directly address disease process . Current research effort aim modify rate heal joint use biological healing factor various growth factor ( transform growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor , fibroblast growth factor , epidermal growth factor , platelet derive growth factor etc . ) find abundantly human blood especially platelet . The platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) ideal autologous biological blood-derived product , exogenously apply various tissue release high concentration platelet derived growth factor enhance body 's natural healing response . In addition PRP possess antimicrobial property may contribute prevention infection . PRP widely test different field medicine possibility aid regeneration tissue low heal potential . Local injection PRP new modality effectively use treatment Achilles tendon injury athlete , chronic epicondylar tendinopathy , chronic patellar tendinosis , rotator cuff tear , anterior cruciate ligament injury , gonoarthrosis plantar fasciitis . The intra-articular injection PRP knee joint find reduce incidence local inflammatory change early knee osteoarthritis . Recently , PRP use low back pain cause SIJ laxity show significant improvement pain score . However , study present compare efficacy intra-articular injection PRP corticosteroid treatment chronic SIJ pain . Considering vast potential PRP safety , study aim study efficacy ultrasound guide intra-articular SIJ injection leukocyte free PRP chronic low back pain due SIJ pathology . In current study , test hypothesis SIJ injection leukocyte-free PRP may effective treatment sacroiliac joint pain compare steroid injection .</brief_summary>
