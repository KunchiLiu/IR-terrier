	<detailed_description>With rapid growth medical technology , patient receive oral endotracheal intubation increase . Although endotracheal intubation life-sustaining procedure , presence deteriorate structure function oropharynx , may contribute difficulty swallow subsequent oral intake . Estimated 62 % patient intubated ≧48 hour experience post-extubation dysphagia . Clearly , intervention need study lack regard . Thus , objective pilot trial evaluate effect Oral Swallowing Care Program swallow oral intake status patient follow prolonged endotracheal intubation . This study employ before-and-after intervention design . The investigator enroll 80 post-extubated adult patient ( 50 year old old ) prolong ( ≥48 hour ) oral endotracheal intubation six medical intensive care unit medical center Taipei , Taiwan . Inclusion criterion - Adult patient ( 50 year old old ) - People extubated 48 hour successfully extubated . - People legal representative agree participate study sign permit - People communicate Mandarin Taiwanese . Exclusion criterion - People diagnosis neurological disease cerebrovascular disease , Parkinson 's disease spinal injury , etc . - People abnormal structure function oropharynx patient head neck cancer acquired/ inherit abnormal oropharynx structure . - People currently endotracheostomy . - People unconscious mental disability , difficulty follow protocol interact others . - People absolute quarantine . patient open tuberculosis . - People swallow difficulty current intubation . Participants assess within 48 hour post-extubation baseline data , 14-day , daily Oral Swallowing Care Program involve moisturize cleanse oral cavity , massage salivary gland , oral motor exercise , intake education provide . Outcome assess 7th , 14th , 21st day post-extubation include oral health status , oral sensation ( stereognosis , light touch two-point discrimination ) , tongue lip strength , salivary secretion , body weight .
