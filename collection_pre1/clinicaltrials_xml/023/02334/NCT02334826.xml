	<brief_title>Revascularization With BVS CABG Patients With Advanced CAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) lead cause death among adult population develop country . Optimal method revascularization patient multivessel CAD still matter debate . Currently , two recognize method : percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) . Both method compare number study , include several randomized trial . Most trial leave doubt . First , none use functional evaluation stenosis . The decision regard revascularization base angiographic result alone . The trial use fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) show clear correlation degree stenosis assess angiographically , range 50-90 % , functional significance . In randomized FAME trial , 1329 significant stenosis assess anatomically , nearly 40 % reveal functional significance . The study show coronary revascularization guide FFR multivessel stable CAD result small number vessel stented , hence few stent implantation . Such strategy improve patient clinical outcome . In group patient undergo revascularization base fractional flow reserve significant reduction major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) observe 1- 2-year follow . Another weakness former study use first-generation drug elute stent ( DES ) show increase risk restenosis late late stent thrombosis . Many randomized study document superiority new generation DES , biocompatible bioresorbable polymer term incidence MACE ( SPIRIT , LEADERS ) . Recently , fully bioresorbable vascular scaffold ( BVS ) introduce routine clinical practice . Preliminary result ABSORB EXTEND trial demonstrate similar efficacy safety Absorb BVS , compare best-in-class metallic counterpart XIENCE . Since complete resorption scaffold require two-three year , great clinical benefit observed couple year implantation . Total bioresorption scaffold allow restore physiological function vessel , also eliminate number adverse event associate presence permanent metallic prosthesis vessel wall , late stent thrombosis neo-atherosclerosis development . Intravascular image intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) widely consider gold standard scaffold optimal implantation , although currently routinely use . The use intravascular image technique BVS implantation may help avoid inadequate expansion apposition scaffold strut . Subintimal calcification detect IVUS OCT require adequate lesion preparation stent deployment . This particularly crucial patient receive BVS , goal lesion preparation facilitate scaffold delivery , reduce plaque shift allow optimal scaffold expansion . OCT great resolution enable assess scaffold integrity , apposition presence thrombus edge dissection . Based ABSORB EXTEND trial suggestion longer dual antiplatelet therapy duration potent agent clopidogrel ( i.e . ticagrelor ) regardless clinical presentation , particularly first month BVS implantation . Ticagrelor PLATO trial show reduce rate combine endpoint cardio-vascular death , myocardial infarction , stroke compare clopidogrel . In patient treated PCI , also reduce rate stent thrombosis . Statins widely use LDL-lowering drug high-risk patient . It recommend achieve great 50 % reduction LDL level . Treatment goal fast LDL-cholesterol &lt; 70 mg/dl ( 1.8 mmol/l ) . In comparison lipid-lowering agent , rosuvastatin potent agent achieve require reduction LDL . Rosuvastatin maximal tolerate dose indicate reduce risk myocardial infarction revascularization procedure . RELEASE-BVS study first trial take account follow important aspect : - stable advanced coronary artery disease : 3-vessel disease significant leave main ( LM ) stenosis , suitable either PCI CABG proven ischemia stress CMR ; - coronary revascularization ( PCI ) guide functional assessment stenosis ( iFR/FFR ) ; - use bioresorbable everolimus-eluting scaffold ( Absorb ) PCI optimization intracoronary imaging technique ( OCT ) ; - long-term post-procedural management potent antiplatelet drug ( ticagrelor ) optimal lipid-lowering therapy maximal tolerate dose rosuvastatin .</detailed_description>
