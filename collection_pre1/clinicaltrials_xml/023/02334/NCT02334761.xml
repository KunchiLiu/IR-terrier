	<brief_summary>Over past decade paradigm care oncology evolve advent personalized medicine . Yet , despite excite prospect , currently disease subtypes therapeutic approach proven benefit exist EGFR target therapy EGFR-mutant lung tumour . With increase number novel molecularly target agent available , importance building understand cancer biology critical . Challenges implement personalize medicine include limitation molecular testing , tumour heterogeneity molecular evolution , cost , quality morbidity associate tumour biopsy . Sequential biopsy essential good understand biological marker response resistance , identify predictive prognostic marker . Despite scientific rationale biopsy , incorporate practice challenge , many case direct advantage patient . This project aim understand effect research biopsies patient . The Investigator hypothesize learn gain good appreciation impact patient , Investigators increase likelihood achieve serial biopsy . The ability obtain serial biopsy dependent patient 's experience . To understand clonal progression cancer validate predictive prognostic marker response , study target biopsy enrollment progression . As Investigators strive achieve , improve understanding patient 's experience help u identify factor positively negatively impact patient participation influence probability successfully obtain sequential sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Both primary secondary objective assess questionnaire . Primary Objectives To assess impact research biopsy patient quality life . Secondary Objectives To assess impact diagnostic biopsy quality life comparison research biopsy . To assess true complication rate associated biopsy . To compare type biopsy - surgical versus radiological respect implication quality life . To assess individual potentially modifiable factor reason biopsy ; perceive risk ; perceive benefit ; wait time biopsy ; wait time result ; complication ; altruism association anxiety . To determine factor associate high low likelihood achieve serial biopsy .</detailed_description>
