	<detailed_description>- Background : Despite availability pharmacological psychosocial treatment , affected individual experience addiction chronic illness severe consequence health outcome . A fundamental challenge researcher domain therefore understand mechanism lead relapse . Among key vulnerability factor associate addiction chronicity , increase attention focus deficit executive function associate trait ( impulsivity , risk taking ) likely explain many individual addiction unable avoid high-risk contexts manage experience crave . Research concern vulnerability relapse hinder manner cognitive deficit traditionally assess clinical research . Most commonly , think represent stable risk factor show little variation within give individual . However , executive functioning may fluctuate rapidly time ( attention , memory , key cognitive function ) , therefore comparison overall 'mean ' cognitive deficit healthy substance-dependent individual may show significant difference despite powerful effect vulnerability . Therefore , absence measurement characterization important relapse mechanism prevents research concern underlying pathophysiology . - Purpose : Deficits executive functioning may explain many individual addiction unable avoid high-risk contexts manage experience crave lead substance use . The principal objective project acquire rest state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) data patient current addiction complete ( distinct protocol ) mobile assessment daily life executive fluctuation , crave , substance use . - Detailed description : 120 individual alcohol , cannabis nicotine dependence well healthy control administer whole-brain imaging exam . The current research project constitute highly novel approach understand pathophysiology addiction combination neuroimaging state-of-the-art information collect independent investigation concern real-time expression risk factor .</detailed_description>
