	<brief_title>Prospective Study Long-term Outcome After Non-aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) usually cause rupture intracranial aneurysm , 15 % patient spontaneous SAH , discernible bleed source identify despite repetitive radiological imaging . The blood distribution describe perimesencephalic/prepontine non-perimesencephalic . Depending pattern SAH clinical course patient similar aneurysmal SAH . In general , patient perimesencephalic SAH ( PM-SAH ) consider achieve good outcome lower rebleeding risk . However , long-term outcome data patient suffer spontaneous non-aneurysmal SAH ( non-aSAH ) scarce lack physical psychological outcome . Therefore , aim present study investigate long-term physical psychological outcome patient suffer non-aneurysmal spontaneous SAH . SAH confirm compute tomography ( CT ) lumbar puncture . Only patient non-traumatic SAH include . In hospital algorithm patient SAH underwent angiography include 3D digital subtraction angiography ( DSA ) since 2002 rule intracranial source SAH . In case negative initial angiography , DSA repeat 14 day . Additionally , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) head/spine perform rule spinal bleeding source . In patient blood distribution exceed typical perimesencephalic pattern , third DSA perform 3 month SAH . The first ( short-term ) follow-up ( F/U ) perform six month ictus . Outcome measure accord modify Rankin Scale ( mRS ) stratify favorable ( mRS 0-2 ) unfavorable ( mRS 3-6 ) six month . Patients non-aSAH divided perimesencephalic SAH ( PM-SAH ) , non-perimesencephalic SAH ( NPM-SAH ) excellent Outcome group ( mRS 0 ) . Also NPM-SAH group stratify Fisher 3 blood pattern NPM-SAH without Fisher 3 blood pattern . Patients , least 18 month ictus non-aneurysmal SAH , receive regular mail include letter explain study purpose postal questionnaire consist short-form health survey 36 simple question . If n't receive answer three month make telephone interview patient ' family member general practitioner .</detailed_description>
