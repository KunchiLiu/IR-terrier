	<brief_summary>The IMPROVA study design identify novel predictor vascular access success failure . Clinical assessment compliment Doppler ultrasound currently employ method assess suitability placement arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) . These technique capable predict vascular access outcome suggest potentially measurable factor may play part . Despite effort improve placement AVF haemodialysis incident prevalent population , many patient continue dialyse central venous catheter ( CVC ) , expose high risk infection , co morbidity mortality dialyse via AVF . Furthermore , AVF primary failure rate reportedly high 20-50 % publish series confirm ultrasound inform clinician sufficiently accurately predict success failure . The aim study perform enhance assessment arterial health preoperatively correlate measurement early AVF outcome . We intend perform pulse wave analysis velocity ; measure advance glycation end product assess endothelial function use vascular occlusion test . We also aim assess whether patient report symptom hand function predict AVF outcome . These non-invasive measurement provide accurate picture overall vascular health prior AVF formation ultimate intention inform clinician likelihood success failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose propose investigation The IMPROVA study utilise novel non-invasive method arterial health assessment correlate measurement early outcome AVF formation . The development new technique inform clinician pre-operatively aid tailor approach fistula planning , predict inevitable failure consequently improve success rate . The ultimate aim identify novel method predict fistula failure prevent patient develop cycle consecutive failure , catheter dependence therefore bad overall outcome . Background Despite merit autologous arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) , failure rate remain high 20-50 % failing mature . As consequence many patient suffer multiple attempt establish arteriovenous access initiate dialysis Central Venous Catheter ( CVC ) thereby extend risk subsequent failure increase risk mortality serious comorbidity . Predictors maturation report number study . The mainstay pre-operative vascular mapping duplex ultrasonography ( DUS ) rely vessel size site . Whilst demonstrate improved patency decrease early failure rate vascular measurement unable independently predict outcome fistula success suggest contribute factor . The process maturation model around change blood flow , flow pattern subsequent vessel dilatation remodelling . The ability artery vein dilate essential fistula maturation . Factors influence vessel remodelling follow fistula formation investigate important aspect management kidney disease . Arterial stiffness refers distensability , compliance elastic modulus arterial vascular system . It find increase age , diabetes mellitus , atherosclerosis end stage renal disease . Aortic pulse wave velocity consider gold standard assess arterial stiffness pulse wave Vicorder©Skidmore Medical non-invasive , easy learn reproducible method assess stiffness . Increased aortic pulse wave velocity independently associate adverse cardiovascular outcome large prospective study include specifically patient end stage renal failure . Advanced glycation end product ( AGEs ) also implicate development vascular pathology result AVF failure . The measurement advance glycation end product , use AGE reader©Diagnoptics Technologies , offer new avenue establish association AGE level AVF outcomes . Furthermore , potential therapeutic option exist improve AGE-related vascular biology AVFs evidence aminoguanine , ALT-946 , ALT-711 , statins , pyrodoxamine dietary modification reduce AGE level . Endothelial function another aspect arterial health report vascular access research . The INVOS® spectra machine use near infrared spectroscopy measure mixed arteriovenous saturation deep tissue reflection perfusion . Manipulation environment use vascular occlusion test provide invaluable information regard endothelial responsiveness . Patient report symptom vascular health may also provide important information search novel predictor AVF outcomes . Many vascular disease associate symptom reflect severity direct question patient regard vascular health upper limb may offer guidance placement AVF . The combination non-invasive , easy learn reproducible test offer excite opportunity identify predictor improve outcome AVF formation .</detailed_description>
