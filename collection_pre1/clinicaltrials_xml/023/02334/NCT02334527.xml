	<detailed_description>This multicenter phase II trial evaluate palbociclib ( PD-0332991 ) patient metastatic urothelial carcinoma ( UC ) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A ( CDKN2A ) ( also refer p16 ) loss positive Retinoblastoma ( Rb ) expression failure first-line chemotherapy . The study enroll 40 patient identify 36 evaluable patient , use Simon 's two-stage design , primary endpoint progression free survival ( PFS ) 4 month ( PFS4 ) . Secondary objective include estimate median PFS , overall survival ( OS ) , response rate ( RR ) exploratory objective include evaluation molecular predictor response resistance .</detailed_description>
