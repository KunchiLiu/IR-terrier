	<brief_title>Acid-Base Composition With Use hemoDialysates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 10-20 prevalent hemodialysis patient recruit . Subjects randomize receive one weekly hemodialysis treatment use two acetate acid dialysate buffer NaturaLyte GranuFlo , assign random fashion . Acetate bicarbonate concentration assess , eight time point , six time point completion hemodialysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects eligible enter study meet follow criterion : 1 . Adult female male patient ; age ≥18 year . 2 . End stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient treat &gt; 90 day modality maintenance hemodialysis stable dialysis prescription prior month . 3 . Patients utilizing hemodialysis vascular access function arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) graft ( AVG ) prior month . The patient 's AVF/AVG must consider stable function condition expect require surgical revision/intervention participation trial . 4 . Patients average spKt/V ≥1.2 30 day prior screen determine historic monthly laboratory adequacy measurement ; patient one available spKt/V average perform . ( Note : spKt/V capture dialysis machine adequacy measurement . ) 5 . Screening hemoglobin level ≥9 g/dL , investigator considers hemoglobin level clinically stable least 30 day . 6 . A sodium bicarbonate basic dialysate prescription change 30 day prior randomization , anticipate unchanged study participation determine investigator . 7 . Unchanged heparin dose regimen past 30 day prior randomization anticipate unchanged heparin dose participation clinical trial . 8 . No change two week prior randomization anticipate change throughout study phosphate binder , calcium supplement , anticoagulant therapy use hemodialysis treatment ( e.g . warfarin , dabigatran , apixaban , rivaroxaban acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) ) , nondialysate sodium bicarbonate and/or citrate base concomitant medication . 9 . If treat systemic glucocorticoid/corticosteroid medication , dose change previous two month randomization , anticipate dose change throughout study duration ; dose regimen consistent maintenance therapy ( i.e . acute active uncontrolled disease ) determine investigator . ( Note : criterion pertain inhaled and/or topical glucocorticoid/corticosteroid therapy ) 10 . During two week prior screen , average 3.5 kg predialysis weight gain . In event great 3.5 kg note , investigator discus specific medical history Medical Monitor prior enrollment . 11 . Willing comply study procedure available duration study . Patients meet follow criterion ineligible study : 1 . Patients unable provide sign date informed consent clinical research study . 2 . Pregnant lactate female patient . 3 . Females reproductive potential agree use highly effective method contraception , determine investigator . 4 . Missed scheduled outpatient dialysis treatment within two week prior screen anticipate attend prescribed hemodialysis treatment participation study . 5 . Screening historic laboratory value aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) level ≥ 2 time upper limit normal . These blood laboratory test must perform within 30 day prior screen prior randomization . 6 . A screen historic laboratory value total bilirubin &gt; 1.9 mg/dL collect within 30 day prior screen obtain randomization . 7 . Uncontrolled clinically significant blood pressure determine investigator within 30 day prior screen . 8 . Active recent bleeding disorder within past 30 day . 9 . Screening historic platelet count &lt; 100,000 platelet per microliter ( mcL ) collect within 30 day prior screen randomization . 10 . Chronic supplemental oxygen use within 30 day prior randomization . 11 . Current active significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) determine investigator . 12 . Significant residual renal function determine investigator . If amount residual renal function doubt , 24 hour urine collect clinic admission confirm creatinine clearance . Decisions make result obtained inclusion data subject . 13 . Active malignancy malignancy within past five year , exception basal squamous cell carcinoma . 14 . Active clinically uncontrolled autoimmune disease determine investigator . Subjects control autoimmune disease must consider clinically stable opinion investigator ( e.g . subject systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) recent flare exclude ) . The investigator consult refer physician necessary confirm stability autoimmune disease . 15 . Diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . 16 . Diagnosed congestive heart failure ( CHF ) class III IV classify New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) ( refer Appendix A ) within past 60 day . 17 . Planned anticipated need surgical procedure participation study . 18 . Current recent illicit drug use alcohol abuse determine investigator . 19 . Subjects significant medical condition determine investigator , make her/him ineligible study ( e.g . clinically significant vomit dialysis affect acidbase status ) . 20 . Any condition determine investigator would place subject increase risk , preclude subject 's full compliance study procedures visit . 21 . Treatment investigational drug , device intervention within 30 day prior participation clinical trial .</criteria>
