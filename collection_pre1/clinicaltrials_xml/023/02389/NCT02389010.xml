	<brief_title>Clinical Efficacy Platelet Gel From Cord Blood Treatment Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background information study rationale : Evidence . 1 ( platelet gel ) . The gel obtain upon platelet activation platelet rich plasma thrombin pharmaceutical extract cobra venom blood component use clinical purpose number year . The rationale support therapy relate high content growth factor platelet alpha granule deliver topically natural biocompatible carrier ( i.e . platelet ) upon platelet activation . So far , platelet gel mainly use repair recalcitrant skin ulcer diabetic non-diabetic patient autologous blood donation set . Unfortunately , candidate therapy elderly patient , frequently affect number pathologic condition comorbidities make mostly unfit unsuitable process autologous blood collection . In practice , patient could mostly benefit therapy de facto deprive potentially effective treatment limitation . Evidence . 2 ( blood transfusion safety ) . Current system blood donor screen viral nucleic acid test dramatically reduce risk transmission infectious condition transfusion blood blood component . Accordingly , limitation use allogeneic blood blood component mandatory decade ago find current justification . This open perspective increase use allogeneic blood component - include platelet gel - potential advantage large number patient mostly indicate . Evidence . 3 ( platelet gel cord blood ) . A research group lead investigator propose present project recently develop novel method ( PCT . WO 2010/007502 A2 , 21 January 2010 ) obtain platelet gel newborn 's blood remain placenta delivery , aka umbilical cord blood placental blood . The main advantage far identify platelet gel derive cord blood platelet compare platelet gel derive adult platelet relate lack microbiological contamination former different profile growth factor concentration , main difference consist high content VEGF low content TGF cord blood platelet gel . Recent modification perform led procedure platelet gel cord blood prepare store small plastic bag rather tubes dish , easily cryopreserved , store , transport site clinical use apply skin ulcer without break sterility chain . This pave way broad use allogeneic cord blood platelet gel inside outside hospital . Evidence . 4 ( knowledge gap ) . In spite interesting promising result allogeneic cord blood platelet gel , three element miss latter may use extensively patient may need : ( 1 ) complete biochemical characterization ; ( 2 ) regional national program collect prepare necessary dos cord blood platelet gel ; ( 3 ) randomize clinical trial sufficient statistical power detect significant advantage ( clinical economical ) patient treat cord blood platelet gel versus control treat skin ulcer advance medication . In regard , small scale investigation suggest effective use platelet gel may reduce recalcitrant skin ulcer medication cost one tenth cost currently reimburse hospital ineffective advanced medication ( 190.000 euro 19.000 euro treat 11 elderly patient ) . Evidence . 5 ( cord blood banking transplant ) . Cord blood - disposed hospital waste - currently precious source hemopoietic stem cell use bone marrow replacement patient affect severe blood disease . The last 25 year clinical experience stem cell source show high cell dose well HLA match important factor impact patient survival . For reason , cord blood bank preferentially cryopreserve cord blood unit large volume , volume correlate cell content , discard three quarter unit collect . It expect discard rate increase future , also worldwide inventory 600.000 cord blood unit 128 cord blood bank already include unit volume currently consider sub-optimal hemopoietic transplant . It therefore expect 70-80 % cord blood unit donate allogeneic hemopoietic transplant may unsuitable use ultimately discard . These unit use preparation platelet gel suitable program recovery delivery suite , transportation production site process platelet gel develop . Study design : This study multicenter control randomized clinical trial ( Allogeneic cord blood platelet gel ( CBPG ) v Standard local medication ( SLM ) ) . Each clinical centre invite enroll 15 treat 15 control patient , accord local availability 12 month study interval . Sample size calculation : 95 + 5 ( dropout ) test 95 + 5 ( dropout ) control patient ensure 80 % power detect statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05 ) &gt; 60 % heal test v 40 % healing control ( Pocock , 1983 ) . Principles Statistical analysis : Descriptive statistic : summary table treatment group ( except baseline characteristic provide sequence overall ) accord type variable summarise ; quantitative criterion : standard quantitative statistic ( N , mean , SD , median , min-max ) ; qualitative criterion : frequency distribution [ number non-missing observation ( N ) percentages ( % ) ] . CBPG preparation quality control : CB unit routinely collect mother 's informed consent plastic bag contain 21-29 mL citrate-phosphate-dextrose ( CPD ) anticoagulant trained midwife , placenta delivery natural delivery cesarean section respectively , accord locally validated standard operation procedure , accredit public cord blood bank belong Italian Cord Blood Network coordinate Centro Nazionale Sangue . After storage transportation monitor room temperature , unit process preparation CBPG within 48 hour collection . Based previous standardization exercise , participate bank allow use locally available bag convenient size nominal volume consider appropriate protocol . In standardization exercise , decide define main characteristic final CBPC follow : target mean volume 10 ml , range 5-15 ; target mean platelet concentration 1 x 109/L , range 0.8 - 1.2 x 109/L . The latter concentration select agreement platelet concentration define Italian Society Transfusion Medicine platelet gel obtain adult blood . CBPG prepare accord procedure define pilot study bank , include initial centrifugation CB 200-210 g x 10-15 minute , follow transfer platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) secondary bag , centrifugation PRP 1800-2600 g x 15 minute removal supernatant platelet poor plasma ( PPP ) excess final target volume CBPC . The latter define automate algorithm perform Excel spreadsheet use data collection , take account platelet concentration PRP minimum ( 0.8 x 109/L ) maximum ( 1.2 x 109/L ) value platelet concentration aim final CBPC . The platelet concentration PRP divide 0.8 1.2 x 109/L provide upper low bound CBPC volume respectively . The final volume set determining net weight CBPC electronic scale . The CBPC unit finally cryopreserved -80 °C mechanical freezer view clinical use CBPG , require thaw 37° C waterbath activation Calcium gluconate . For standard local medication , clinical center use validate standard local medication . Details specification local standard medication procedure collect participate centre . Treatments : Test treatment : CBPG gel form fibrin trap platelet fragment 10 billion platelet 10 mL neonatal plasma anticoagulated CPD . It store commercial PVC bag blood component preparation storage . In '80s , David Knighton develop technique vitro stimulation platelet , thrombin solution allow collect supernatant abundant growth factor . This product , derive patient platelet locally apply gel encourage ulcer repair . The rationale use product presence several tissue growth factor : P.D.G.F . ( Platelet Derived Growth Factor ) ; E.G.F . ( Epidermal Growth Factor ) ; T.G.F . ( Transforming Growth Factor ) ; V.E.G.F . ( Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ) ; I.G.F . 1 e 2 ( Insulin Growth Factor 1 2 ) ; F.G.F . ( Fibroblast Growth Factor ) . Applying situ iper-concentrated activate platelet platelet gel , tissue regeneration process start accelerated . In set , platelet similar cellular laboratory-tanks process , store release ( activate ) several growth factor able stimulate mesenchymal stem cell regeneration fibroblast , osteoblasts endothelial cell . This platelet ability take part tissue repair mechanisms theoretical essential requirement use platelet gel several circumstance , associate requirement tissue repair activation . Repeated PG application show useful prior wound surgery since reduce lesion size , improve anatomic morphological condition wind bed margin trigger neo-angiogenesis margin within necrotic area . Usual source platelet fraction adult human blood , source involve relevant drawback problem . Peripheral blood human use without potential risk due alloreactivity , result several clinical complication . On hand , availability autologous blood generally low , since dangerous withdraw sufficient amount patient tolerate withdrawal . Moreover , allogeneic blood adult donor involve risk infection . Platelet fraction derive human placental blood avoid drawback also contain high concentration platelet factor . Dosage Administration : For medication patient enrol treatment arm , one CBPG unit ( mean volume 10 ml , range 5-15 ; mean platelet concentration 1 x 109/L ( 0.8 - 1.2 x 109/L ) administer every 3-4 day . CBPG unit , cryopreserved store small plastic bag -80°C freezer , thaw 37°C waterbath activate Calcium gluconate immediately transport site clinical use apply skin ulcer without break sterility chain . Efficacy assessment : Efficacy evaluate CBPG-DFU Clinical Research Form . Safety assessment : Information collect adverse event event associate CBPG occur treatment . Care management effort provide treatment visit include cleanse assess wound obtain vital sign interim wound history , include information regard adverse event , concomitant medication , nutrition weight-bearing status .</detailed_description>
