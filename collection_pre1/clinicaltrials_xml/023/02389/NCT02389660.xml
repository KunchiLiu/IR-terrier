	<detailed_description>Introduction Good mental health high value individual , economic social perspective . Depression serious threat good mental health highly prevalent worldwide . On yearly basis 7 % European population ( around 30 million people ) suffer major depression ( MDD ) ( Wittchen et al. , 2011 ) . If take subclinical form depression account prevalence rise 15 % . Depression highly prevalent ; mark disable emotional physical symptom . It severe negative impact mental wellbeing , quality life social work-related functioning suffer short long term . This impact equal least condition diabetes mellitus , heart disease arthritis ( Sprangers et al. , 2000 ) . Depression associate increased morbidity , mortality , health care utilization health care cost . The World Health Organisation predict depression foremost overall cause disability 2030 ( Mathers , &amp; Loncar , 2006 ) . Objective The main objective plan research compare clinical cost-effectiveness blend Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) adult major depressive disorder ( MDD ) treatment usual ( TAU ) . Study design The study two-arm randomise control non-inferiority cost-effectiveness trial . The trial conduct routine mental health care Poland , part big project fund European Commission ( Grant Agreement No : 603098 ) . A total 150 patient MDD assign one two condition : 1 ) blend CBT , 2 ) TAU . Respondents condition follow 12 month baseline ( measure take baseline , 3 month , 6 month 12 month ) . Study population A total 150 patient MDD recruit routine clinical practice Poland receive either depression treatment usual blend CBT depression treatment . Treatment fidelity To ensure treatment fidelity require : ( 1 ) detail treatment manual available guide therapist treatment , ( 2 ) regular meeting organize therapist research team prevent drift , ( 3 ) therapist register number session , frequency session , main strategy use session duration contact . Randomization Randomization conduct independent researcher involved trial . Randomisation take place individual level , stratified country , eligibility baseline assessment . The independent researcher create allocation scheme computerise random number generator ( Random Allocation Software ) . The allocation ratio 1:1 . We use block randomization variable block size vary 8 14 allocation per block . Subjects randomize two group : Internet base blend depression treatment treatment usual . All investigator clinicians unknown randomization scheme . Sample size calculation Sample size calculation base non-inferiority design calculate primary clinical outcome symptom depression . 150 patient Poland enable u detect clinically significant effect size d=0.24 ( Cuijpers et al. , 2014 ) . Statistical Analysis Multiple imputation use impute miss cost effect data . Intention-to-treat analysis ( ITT ) increase risk type I errors non-inferiority ( NI ) trials non-intention-to treat analysis prefer ITT analyse NI design . Therefore , primary statistical analysis per protocol analysis mean patient complete treatment include analysis . ITT analyse use sensitivity analyse increase confidence result obtain include participant analyse independent whether complete treatment . Blended depression treatment consider less effective care-as-usual two-sided 95 % confidence interval ( range plausible difference two treatment ) lie entirely standard mean difference 0.20 non-inferiority margin small clinically acceptable difference .</detailed_description>
