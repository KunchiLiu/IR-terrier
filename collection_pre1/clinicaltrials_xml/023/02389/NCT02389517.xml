	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well lenalidomide alone compare lenalidomide , ixazomib citrate , dexamethasone work treat patient multiple myeloma remain ( residual ) donor stem cell transplant . Lenalidomide may help immune system kill abnormal blood cell cancer cell may also prevent growth new blood vessel need cancer growth . Ixazomib citrate may stop growth cancer cell interfere protein necessary cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether lenalidomide effective without ixazomib citrate dexamethasone treat residual multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide With Without Ixazomib Citrate Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Residual Multiple Myeloma After Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate minimal residual disease ( MRD ) -negative disease multiparameter-flow cytometry 12 month randomization . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evidence response demonstrate improvement depth response least one category accord International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) response criterion . II . Progression free survival ( PFS ) . III . Overall survival ( OS ) . IV . Duration MRD-negative disease . V. Safety tolerability experimental arm ( ixazomib citrate , lenalidomide , low dose dexamethasone [ IRd ] ) vs. control arm ( lenalidomide [ Rd ] ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determination marker response base pre-treatment characteristic use method describe correlative research . II . Evaluation MRD gene sequence method use Sequenta platform ( LymphoSIGHTÂ® ) parallel multi-parameter flow cytometry ( MFC ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , lenalidomide PO daily ( QD ) day 1-21 , dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ( course 1-4 ) . ARM II : Patients receive lenalidomide PO Arm I . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
