	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness negative pressure incision management system ( Prevena™ Incision Management System ( PIMS ) ActiVAC® Prevena™ Dressings ( Peel Place™ Customizable™ ) , KCI ) prevention wound complication include surgical site infection ( SSI ) non-infectious complication patient undergo vascular surgery groin incision .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Prevena Negative Pressure Incision Management System vs. Standard Dressing After Vascular Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Complications surgical site infection , deep wound infection , prosthetic graft infection , non-infections problem wind dehiscence continue cause significant morbidity patient undergo arterial reconstruction peripheral arterial disease . Patients undergo leg bypass surgery limb salvage particular risk due medical problem diabetes renal failure location incision along groin area . Surgical site infection ( SSI ) estimate occur 5-40 % patient undergoing arterial bypass lower extremity arterial occlusive disease . The in-hospital SSI rate 5 % across Vascular Study Group New England , regional quality improvement registry . Factors contribute wound infection include patient factor advance age comorbidities obesity , diabetes renal insufficiency surgical factor include division local lymphatics groin , placement prosthetic graft inherent difficulty keep incision across groin crease cover , dry protect . Despite use standard sterile technique perioperative preventative antibiotic infection complication continue cause patient morbidity . In addition complication increase intensity cost care add estimate expense $ 11,000 per incident . New strategy need reduce complication . Negative pressure wound therapy potential prevent variety wound complication . One innovative strategy show promise application Prevena dressing system close surgical incision . The dressing consist sterile sponge place incision follow plastic adhesive covering use secure skin form air-tight seal . The sponge connect tube vacuum applies negative pressure close system . This allow fluid drain wound container connect dressing . When compare surgical dressing sterile gauze tape , Prevena dress system advantage provide sterile barrier , reduce tension incision , remove fluid incision . Please refer patient brochure illustration description Prevena dressing system . Negative pressure wound therapy apply many year enhance heal variety open wound include pressure wound , diabetic ulcer , venous stasis ulcer , open infect surgical traumatic wound burn variable success . The treatment base evenly distributed local negative pressure apply wound surface . The open wound fill sponge cover occlusive dressing connect mean set suction tube device applies negative pressure surface wound adjust either cyclically continuously . The fluid wound collect container . The benefit negative pressure wound therapy report include removal infectious material , reduction edema improve perfusion tissue . The success negative pressure wound therapy open wound extrapolate intact surgical incision . Recently negative pressure wound therapy dress develop use close surgical incision . The investigator aim study ability negative pressure wound therapy dress prevent wound complication vascular surgery involve incision groin . The aim study compare Prevena dress system standard surgical dressing patient undergo leg bypass surgery vascular disease involve legs multicenter randomize trial . All aspect procedure part standard vascular surgery practice . Patients undergo vascular surgery incision groin treat standard gauze dress Prevena wound management system apply operating room leave wound 5-7 day . Follow-up visit assess surgical wound already standard care . The two group compare base primary secondary endpoint list document . Quality life compare patient survey cost analysis perform .</detailed_description>
