	<brief_summary>The FLAME Study 16-week clinical trial study treatment lamotrigine fluoxetine bipolar I , II bipolar schizoaffective depress adult . The purpose trial well understand whether individual particular gene type inherit biological marker good response fluoxetine lamotrigine , alternatively , would likely side effect medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>16-week Comparative Effectiveness Trial Lamotrigine vs. Fluoxetine Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression predominant prevail mood state bipolar disorder associate substantial morbidity mortality . However , comparison acute mania , bipolar depression understudy standpoint pathophysiology well clinical trial treatment development . Given lack evidence-based guideline , clinician participant enter treatment phase little guidance . The FLAME Study 16-week , open randomize comparative effectiveness trial evaluate genomic predictor biomarkers response adverse event treatment lamotrigine ( n=200 ) fluoxetine ( n=200 ) bipolar I , II bipolar schizoaffective depress adult ( 18-65 ) . Participants recruit 5-year period . It know functionally significant genetic polymorphism pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamic pathway influence individual difference repose specific medication . We propose evaluate contribution pharmacogenomic variation lamotrigine fluoxetine treatment response adverse event . We correlate clinical phenotype response adverse event treatment genotype haplotype variation drug metabolism , neurotransmitter biosynthesis , ( metabolism , storage , release , reuptake ) , receptor intracellular signaling-that previously implicate either lamotrigine fluoxetine . These initial step complement genome-wide analysis ( GWA ) , pathway analysis candidate gene study . Based result aim develop translational treatment algorithm bipolar depression may help individualize treatment bipolar depression . This algorithm participant could potentially increase likelihood successful treatment intervention , deliver `` right treatment , right participant right time '' , decrease number ineffective treatment and/or risk serious adverse event .</detailed_description>
