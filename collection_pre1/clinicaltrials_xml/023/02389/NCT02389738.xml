	<detailed_description>Blood brain barrier : The blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) intricate barricade compose three distinct cell type : brain endothelial cell , pericytes , astrocyte foot process . While molecule small lipophilic may easily traverse BBB , large ( &gt; 180 Daltons ) and/or hydrophilic particle require active transport , receptor mediation . Specifically , BBB integrity degree permeability regulate capillary endothelial cell response astrocytic signal . The strength intercellular junction ( ex . tight junction , adherins ) amongst endothelial cell also play major role permeability . Therefore , modulation paracellular property may serve large part decrease BBB integrity thus improve drug penetration tumor bed . Rationale Regadenoson : Adenosine may plausible mean transiently disrupt BBB . Adenosine function regulate four structurally relate G-protein coupled receptor : A1 , A2A , A2B A3 . Specifically , A1 A2A high expression level within brain . In 2011 , Carman et al demonstrate , selective A2A receptor agonist , Regadenoson , increase BBB permeability 70kD Dextran mouse rat brain . The large molecule Dextran see brain 180 minute follow single injection mouse rat . Studies perform Johns Hopkins also demonstrate transient disruption BBB Regadenoson rodent measure temozolomide concentration . The investigator find brain/plasma concentration rat post Regadenoson result 1.6 fold increase temozolomide compare temozolomide give alone normal rat brain . Future animal study evaluate varied chemotherapy agent within brain brain tumor without Regadenoson . Currently , Regadenoson approve US Food Drug Administration coronary vasodilator , myocardial perfusion image patient suspect myocardial coronary artery disease . Single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) image perform 99mTc-sestamibi radiotracer use measure coronary blood flow rest stress condition Regadenoson . While adverse event profile similar adenosine , common side effect Regadenoson flushing , chest pain , dyspnea headache . Intracerebral Microdialysis : Plasma drug concentration measurement unreliable method ass delivery drug across BBB . In contrast , intracerebral microdialysis monitoring allow approximate measurement within extracellular fluid ( ECF ) sample brain . Microdialysis placement within brain novel technique utilize routinely intensive care unit set measure brain metabolism sample ECF traumatic brain injury patient . Microdialysis catheter FDA approve place routinely intracranial pressure monitor . This method allow continuous measurement ECF within tumor normal tissue . The dialysis probe semipermeable membrane le 1 mm diameter two section microcatheter fuse . Previous study demonstrate feasibility keep catheter place critically injure patient 2 week . When placed time surgical resection , microcatheters sterotactically implant , place probe within desire brain and/or tumor region . Externally , catheter connect syringe pump , delivers low flow rate ( µl/min ) continuous perfusion fluid ( Lactated Ringers artificial CSF ) dialysate collect microvial outlet tube . This sterile , single use catheter minimally invasive develop achieve optimal diffuse characteristic similar passive diffusion capillary blood vessel . Just function brain capillary vessel , water , inorganic ion small organic molecule freely diffuse across membrane probe , whereas protein protein bound compound impermeable . Additionally , lipophilic compound poorly recover . Use Intracerebral Microdialysis Quantitate temozolomide Concentrations Temozolomide FDA approve oral alkylating agent use upfront relapsed therapy adult pediatric patient high grade glioma . While temozolomide ( TMZ ) radiotherapy assist improve overall survival rate high grade glioma , previous study prove approximately 20 % drug cross BBB peripheral administration . The peak concentration TMZ brain show approximately 1-2 hour ingestion . Once ingested , TMZ undergo degradation prodrug form highly reactive alkylating agent , methyl-triazenyl imidazole carboxamide ( MTIC ) . Previous study utilize brain microdialysis catheter measure TMZ brain interstitium level post primary metastatic brain resection/biopsy . Both serum dialysates collect 30 minute time interval analyze quantitate TMZ drug delivery tumor bed surround tissue yet due drug stability issue , MTIC concentration feasible measurement microdialysis set . Thus , investigator propose measure TMZ concentration pre post Regadenoson administration hypothesis transient BBB disruption result improve drug efficacy brain interstitium tumor bed . If gross total resection achieve two microdialysis catheter place resection . One microdialysis catheter place MRI enhance tumor area one catheter place non-enhancing area , allow later assessment degree BBB permeability tumor normal brain . These study beneficial evaluate role increase temozolomide delivery effort increase tumor cytotoxicity progression-free survival aggressive tumor . Use Intracerebral Microdialysis Quantitate Markers Neuroinflammation Previous study demonstrate patient increase inflammatory cytokine medical illness exhibit increase rate depression . Both chronic acutely elevated level inflammatory cytokine result development neuropsychiatric dysfunction , include cognitive slowing , inattention , depression . Specifically , Dowlati et al conclude meta-analytic study small proportion patient idiopathic major depressive disorder exhibit increased serum cytokine level . Thus , investigator propose quantitate marker neuroinflammation oxidative stress collect dialysate , hypothesis variance level may correlate affective and/or cognitive dysfunction . Risks Microdialysis : These study novel investigation use brain microdialysis measure TMZ concentration post-operative set combinational administration Regadenoson temozolomide . To minimize risk post-surgical resection biopsy , patient receive temozolomide 150mg/m2 twice , less half standard 5 day course administer maintenance therapy malignant glioma post radiation therapy . In addition , therapy give two day ICU setting , minimal tumor toxicity anticipate suboptimal treatment dose short duration . [ The procedure involve insertion removal dialysis probe perform minimal injury time surgery . [ 18,19 ] Although insertion microdialysis probe could conceivably disrupt BBB , proven problematic , demonstrate rapid normalization BBB placement , allow equilibration minimization artifact . [ 20-22 ] Although safely perform , microdialysis nevertheless invasive surgical procedure small risk bleed site insertion discomfort patient . The previous study evaluate brain interstitium concentration TMZ evaluate dialysate sample seven patient . All patient tolerate placement catheter collection dialysate sample well , yet 1 patient develop several grade 3 4 neurologic adverse event whose etiology remain unclear . All neurologic deficit improve without completely resolve .</detailed_description>
