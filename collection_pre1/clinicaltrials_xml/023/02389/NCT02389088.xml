	<brief_title>Effect Increased Circulating Androgens Granulosa Cell Responses FSH .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Various previous study demonstrate androgen enhance granulosa cell function variety animal specie include rodent non-human primate . In vitro study show granulosa cell expose either testosterone dihydrotestosterone exhibit increase production estrogen , progesterone inhibin response FSH . Studies do non-human primate also show androgen increase number preantral antral follicle well increase FSH receptor mRNA expression granulosa cell . This suggest granulosa cell hyperresponsiveness FSH polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) may relate androgen excess . The investigator plan address possibility perform series vivo study . In one investigator 's prior study androgen blockade do administration flutamide E2 responses FSH assess . This study complete manuscript prepare publication . In present protocol , investigator propose study role androgens 2 phase study . In first phase investigator plan suppress endogenous steroid hormone production ovary via treatment GnRH analog Lupron 4 week beyond gradual resumption ovarian activity occur . Granulosa cell ( inhibin B ) responses FSH examine ovarian suppression well early moderate recovery ovarian steroidogenesis . These result provide control data comparison make result next phase . In second phase , 2 month washout interval , subject receive Lupron suppress endogenous steroid production . After 4 week , begin ovarian activity resumption , investigator administer Letrozole 5mg 14 day examine granulosa cell response FSH recovery . Letrozole 3rd generation aromatase inhibitor result suppression E2 production increase circulate serum androgen level 40 % great pre-treatment value . It also use ovulation induction . It minimal side effect general well tolerate . By use Letrozole 2 week GnRH suppression ovary , investigator effectively increase amount circulate androgen keep estrogen low level , thereby allow investigator completely study effect isolate elevated androgen level granulosa cell response FSH . By compare result obtain phase 1 , investigator able determine androgen mediate response granulosa cell FSH stimulation absence ovarian steroid . Also , addition control group allow investigator determine granulosa cell response different PCOS normal . It hypothesize significant rise inhibin B production granulosa cell PCOS woman response FSH treatment Letrozole compare control group responses observe control phase study . This would confirm androgen indeed responsible least part hyperresponsiveness FSH see woman PCOS .</detailed_description>
