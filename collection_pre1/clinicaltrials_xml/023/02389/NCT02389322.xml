	<brief_summary>The investigator select 500 subject meet standard consider study population I . Do specific gamma-interferon detection skin test， inject intradermally two dosage ESAT6-CFP10 Tuberculin purify protein derivative ( TB-PPD ) different arm subject get 192 participant whose three kind detection result negative consider study population II.Then , immune Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) vaccine placebo BCG . Do specific gamma-interferon detection skin test， inject intradermally two dosage ESAT6-CFP10 TB-PPD different arm subject 12 week immunity.Negative rate ESAT6-CFP10 vaccination BCG main index , evaluate specificity different dose ESAT6-CFP10 , conform optimal dose ESAT6-CFP10 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.the correlation three detection method study population I 500 study population I randomly divide two different dose group average , accord ESAT6-CFP10 dose ( 5μg/ml 10μg/ml ) . Do specific gamma-interferon ( γ-IFN ) detection skin test，then inject intradermally 5μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 10μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 TB-PPD different arm subject.Evaluate respectively positive rate three detection method 、the correlation three detection method security study population I application ESAT6-CFP10 . 2.screen study population II Choose participant , whose result three detection ( ESAT6-CFP10、TB-PPD andγ-IFN ) negative , HIV negative chest X-ray abnormality , study population II . 3.study population II vaccinate BCG placebo Study population II , accord proportion , randomly divide four group double blind state , : 5μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 BCG immunization , 10μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 BCG immunization , 5μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 placebo-controlled immunization , 10μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 placebo-controlled immunization.They vaccinate BCG placebo BCG . 4.Inject ESAT6-CFP10 12 week inoculation study population II The investigator draw blood operate specific gamma-interferon ( γ-IFN ) detection skin test，then inject intradermally 5μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 10μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 ( double blind state ) TB-PPD different arm subject , accord group scheme . Calculate negative coincidence rate correlation three detection method , observe safety ESAT6-CFP10 study population II time.Evaluate specificity different dose ESAT6-CFP10 , negative rate ESAT6-CFP10 vaccination BCG main index . And finally conform optimal dose ESAT6-CFP10 .</detailed_description>
