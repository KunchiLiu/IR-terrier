	<criteria>Major Signed date write informed consent Male surgically sterile postmenopausal female age ≥ 50 ≤ 89 year . Male subject childbearing potential partner willing use condom treatment 28 day last dose study medication . Diagnosis MCI due AD mild dementia due AD amnestic presentation , accord AANIA ( Alzheimer 's Association ( AA ) National Institute ( Aging NIA ) criteria [ Albert et al 2011 ; McKhann et al 2011 ] MiniMental State Examination ( MMSE ) score 21 30 inclusive screen A positive AD signature show one following ( either , b , c , OR ) : 1 . Screening CSF sample Abeta 42 concentration less 638 ng/L AND total tau &gt; 375 ng/L , assessed central laboratory . 2 . Screening CSF sample Abeta 42 concentration less 638 ng/L AND ptau &gt; 52 ng/L , assessed central laboratory . 3 . Tau/Abeta ratio &gt; 0.52 , assess central laboratory . 4 . A positive amyloid PET available prior screen . Treatment naïve , mean receive prior establish specific treatment MCI due AD mild dementia due AD include ( prior ) use acetylcholinesterase inhibitor memantine . A maximum two month prior cumulative treatment acetylcholinesterase inhibitor memantine allow acetylcholinesterase inhibitor memantine discontinue due intolerance , do least two month prior baseline . Use Souvenaid allow Souvenaid discontinue least twomonths prior baseline , subject stable dose least six month prior baseline willing continue study dose frequency . Outpatient study partner capable accompany subject clinic visit . In accordance Swedish regulation availability study partner applicable Sweden . Major Significant neurologic disease , AD , may affect cognition . Atypical clinical presentation MCI due AD mild dementia due AD , visual variant AD ( include posterior cortical atrophy ) language variant ( include logopenic aphasia ) . Concomitant disorder : Severe hepatic ( ChildPugh C ) and/or kidney failure ( creatinine clearance ( estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate eGFR ) ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73m2 ) and/or serum creatinine 1.5 fold Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) and/or AlanineAmino Transferase ( AST ) AsparagineAmino Transferase ( ALT ) 3 fold ULN baseline . History screen visit brain MRI scan indicative significant abnormality . Current presence clinically important major psychiatric disorder ( e.g . major depressive disorder ) define DSM5 criterion , symptom ( ) ( e.g . hallucination ) could affect subject 's ability complete study . . Current clinically important systemic illness likely result clinically relevant deterioration subject 's condition might affect subject 's safety study . Other clinically important disease condition abnormality vital sign , physical examination , neurologic examination , laboratory result , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) examination ( e.g . atrial fibrillation ) could compromise study safety subject . Clinically important infection within 30 day prior screen e.g . chronic persistent acute infection , bronchitis urinary tract infection . Any known hypersensitivity excipients contain test article formulation . Severe hepatic failure ( ChildPugh C ) OR kidney failure ( creatinine clearance ( eGFR ) ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73m2 ) OR serum creatinine 1.5 fold ULN OR AST ALT 3 fold ULN screening.´ Concomitant Medication/Therapies : The following therapy permit give interval prior baseline Endoftreatment ( EOT ) : Use experimental medication AD investigational medication device treatment indication AD within 60 day prior baseline . Treatment Souvenaid , except use Souvenaid discontinue least two month prior baseline , subject stable dose least six month prior baseline willing continue use Souvenaid study dose frequency . Concomitant treatment St. John 's Wort ( wash phase least two week prior baseline require ) . Any concomitant treatment impairs cognitive function wash least four week prior baseline .</criteria>
