	<brief_title>Blood Flow Within Active Myofascial Trigger Points Following Massage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The physiological response myofascial trigger point ( MTrP ) massage know , yet would provide important objective evidence treatment effect clarify resolution process MTrP . The long-term goal understand therapeutic intervention affect physiology MTrP . The objective propose research ass , placebo control trial , effectiveness trigger point release massage ( also know ischemic compression ) blood flow active MTrP . The central hypothesis contraction nodule active MTrP characterize ischemic state comprise reduced blood flow subsequent dysregulation carbohydrate metabolism . The investigator hypothesize trigger point release ( TPR ) positively impact blood flow lead change high energy carbohydrate tension . The present study formulate , part , preliminary study conduct investigator , support reduce blood flow physiological disruption active MTrPs . The propose research provide physiological basis massage corroborate subjective report reduce pain sensitivity , impart credibility treatment technique , provide insight mechanism action heal MTrP .</detailed_description>
