	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis study high concentration soy protein intake increase satiety decrease energy intake subsequent meal . The secondary hypothesis synergistic effect soy protein polydextrose increase satiety reduce energy intake subsequent meal . The third hypothesis ingestion protein polydextrose differentially impact satiety-related metabolism , i.e . blood glucose , insulin , urea , plasma amino acid , gut hormone gastric emptying .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Soy Protein Polydextrose Food Intake Young Chinese Adult Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Soy food part Asian food system millennium . In past decade , soy protein polydextrose widely use variety food product . Helping consumer feel less hungry approach weight management potential decrease inter-meal hunger hence reduce overall energy intake . Considering possible satiety effect soy protein polydextrose , inclusion molecule diet could therefore potentially reduce energy intake assist weight management order attenuate rise obesity incidence globally . The study provide data first time soy protein soluble fiber impact satiety acute energy intake Chinese ethnic origin . The research set determine effect soy protein polydextrose satiety food intake Asians . It specifically attempt comprehend physiological mechanism involve blood glucose , insulin , urea , plasma amino acid , gut hormone rate gastric empty soy protein polydextrose appetite rating , satiety subsequent food intake . The study recruit healthy young Chinese male , return four test session non-consecutive day . At session , subject give standard breakfast , follow 180 min later soybean curd preload buffet lunch 90 min preload . Four preloads test : ( 1 ) low protein , ( 2 ) high protein , ( 3 ) low protein polydextrose , ( 4 ) high protein polydextrose . Each soybean curd preload test subject . Blood sample cannulate vein fingerpricks collect preload , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 90 min preload analysis glucose , insulin , urea , plasma amino acid , gut hormone . At time point blood sample collect , gastric empty measurement carry use ultrasound . Subjective motivational rating hunger , fullness , desire eat prospective food consumption measure use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) .</detailed_description>
