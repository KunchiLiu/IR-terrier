	<brief_title>Intranasal Bevacizumab HHT-Related Epistaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ( HHT ) autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterize systemic vascular malformation result mutation ENG gene , encode factor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) pathway . HHT diagnose Curacao Criteria include presence epistaxis ; telangiectasias vascular malformation lung , liver , nervous system ; positive family history involve first-degree relative . One common presentation disease recurrent profound epistaxis , many patient report 4 epistaxis episode day , many last hour . HHT-related epistaxis often result severe anemia require intravenous iron repeat blood transfusion , also carry significant psychosocial disability relating impaired quality life work absenteeism . Multiple approach treatment describe , include electrocautery , laser treatment , embolization , septodermoplasty , last resort , Young 's procedure , involve closure nasal vestibule . These approach largely palliative , variable effectiveness , almost always require repeated procedure chronic management bleeding . There great need development new treatment option reduce medical morbidity quality life impairment associate refractory epistaxis HHT . Recently promise data suggest inhibition angiogenesis may effective strategy manage HHT-related bleeding . Circulating concentration VEGF significantly elevate HHT , make VEGF attractive therapeutic target . Preliminary study suggest bevacizumab , recombinant monoclonal antibody inhibit biologic activity VEGF , significantly improve epistaxis severity topically apply , locally inject , intravenously administer . However , early pilot study bevacizumab limited exclusively retrospective case series . As yet , prospective double-blind placebo control trial serial follow time point establish role bevacizumab treatment HHT-related epistaxis . Based exist level 4 evidence suggest bevacizumab injection beneficial management HHT-related epistaxis , hypothesize patient receive intranasal injection bevacizumab time electrocautery treatment improvement frequency severity epistaxis compare patient receive injection saline control .</detailed_description>
