	<brief_summary>Background : - Ebola virus spread quickly cause serious disease . It currently cause outbreak West Africa . There approved treatment Ebola . ZMappTM new drug make natural infection-fighting substance . Researchers want see treat Ebola . Objective : - To assess safety ZMappTM body process . To measure immune system response ZMappTM . Eligibility : - Healthy people 18 50 year old . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . They electrocardiogram ( ECG ) measure heart electrical activity . Small pad stuck arm , leg , chest . - Participants admitted hospital . They physical exam , medication review , blood sample . - Two intravenous ( IV ) line place separate arm vein . A needle use guide plastic tubing vein . One use take blood sample . The used give study drug . - Participants give drug help prevent side effect . - Participants give study drug IV 10 12 hour . Participants monitor closely vital sign take frequently . They may another ECG . - Blood sample take , , infusion . - Participants stay hospital 1 2 night receive drug . - Participants several study visit 90 day get study drug . They ask side effect . They may physical exam , blood may draw .</brief_summary>

The current standard care EBOV infection limit supportive treatment . ZMapp TM , combination three chimeric human/murine monoclonal antibody EBOV surface glycoprotein find virion infected cell , develop treatment Ebola virus disease . This Phase 1a , open-label study ass safety pharmacokinetics single intravenous administration ZMapp tm healthy adult volunteer . Three subject receive single intravenous dose 50mg/kg infusion evaluate study Days 0 , 1 , 2 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 60 , 90 . Samples collect pharmacokinetic immunogenicity assessment baseline , , follow infusion . Subjects monitor assessed safety incidence adverse event course study .</detailed_description>
