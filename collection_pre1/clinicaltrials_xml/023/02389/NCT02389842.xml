	<detailed_description>This phase Ib trial palbociclib combination either taselisib pictilisib . The study include dose escalation phase ( Part A ) , MTD dose expansion phase ( Part B ) . Part A : investigate escalating dose palbociclib either pictilisib taselisib administer orally , continuously 21 day 28 day cycle patient advance solid tumour recruit simultaneously two parallel arm ( 24 patient arm maximum 48 patient Part A ) . Once MTD determine combination optimum safety PK/PD profile determine SRC take forward dose expansion phase ( Part B ) . Part B : The MTD dose expansion phase conduct use optimal combination Part A two parallel arm follow : B1 : Patients ( n=25 ) PIK3CA mutant ER + HER2-ve advance breast cancer treat triplet combination palbociclib either taselisib pictilisib along fulvestrant . Part B1 require least two first 15 patient respond progress recruit full 25 patient . B2 : Patients ( n=20 ) PIK3CA mutant advance solid tumour include least 8 patient PIK3CA mutant ER negative and/or HER2 positive breast cancer treat doublet combination palbociclib either taselisib pictilisib . Other cancer relevant genetic aberration ( e.g . KRAS mutation ) may consider , depend emerge preclinical clinical data novel antitumour agent . In total , expect minimum 70 maximum 93 patient enrolled trial , final number depend number dose escalation require reach DLT . If &lt; 48 patient enrolled Part A , investigator permit enrol &gt; 45 patient Part B , provide maximum number patient remain ≤93 patient across study . The anticipated accrual rate dose escalation phase estimate 2 patient per month . Accrual expansion phase estimate 4 patient per month across 2 centre . It expect trial duration recruitment 12 24 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Part A ( dose escalation ) : Patients histologically cytologically confirm malignant advance solid tumour refractory standard therapy suitable effective standard therapy exists , include , limited patient PIK3CA mutant cancer , somatic mutation aberration know result hyperactivated PI3KAKT pathway . Advanced breast cancer follow feature : ER+ve breast cancer progress least one line prior endocrine therapy , PIK3CA mutant breast cancer progress least one line prior endocrine therapy chemotherapy breast cancer refractory standard treatment Part B ( dose expansion ) : Patients histologically cytologically advanced solid tumour progress least one prior chemotherapy regimen advance cancer PIK3CA mutation detect tumour and/or circulate tumour DNA . Patients HER2 positive breast cancer progress least two prior HER2 direct therapy advance breast cancer . Cohort B1 : ER+ve HER2ve postmenopausal breast cancer progress least one prior hormone therapy advance breast cancer . Cohort B2 : Advanced PIK3CA mutant solid tumour , include limit triple negative and/or HER2 positive breast cancer lung , head neck cancer . NB . PIK3CA mutation may assess archival tumour sample , fresh tumour sample , circulate free DNA extract plasma serum . A mutation consider pathogenic describe recurrent somatic mutation COSMIC ( http : //cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/cosmic/ ) . Other cancer relevant genetic aberration ( e.g . KRAS mutation ) may consider , depend emerge preclinical clinical data novel antitumour agent 2 . Part A : Measurable disease assess RECIST 1.1 OR evaluable disease . Part B1 : Measurable disease assess RECIST 1.1 Part B2 : Measurable disease assess RECIST 1.1 OR evaluable disease 3 . Life expectancy least 12 week 4 . World Health Organisation ( WHO ) performance status 01 significant deterioration previous 2 week 5 . Haematological biochemical index within range show . These measurement must perform within one week ( Day 7 Day 1 ) patient go trial . Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥ 10.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) except patient documented Gilberts ' disease Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x ( ULN ) unless raise due tumour case 5 x ULN permissible Creatinine : If creatinine &gt; 1.5 time ULN : Either : Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min ( uncorrected value ) Or : Isotope clearance measurement ≥ 50mL/min ( correct ) Coagulation : INR &lt; 1.5 APTT &lt; 1.5x ULN 6 . Female patient reproductive potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior start trial .

Need current chronic corticosteroid therapy , specifically dexamethasone ≥ 10 mg prednisone per day equivalent dose anti inflammatory corticosteroid . Stable use ( i.e. , change dose within 1 month prior Day 1 Cycle 1 ) inhale corticosteroid allow . 17 . Prior bone marrow transplant extensive radiotherapy great 25 % bone marrow within eight week . 18 . Is participant plan participate another interventional clinical trial , whilst take part Phase I study . Participation observational trial would acceptable . 19 . Current malignancy type , exception adequately treat conebiopsied situ carcinoma cervix uteri basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Cancer survivor , undergone potentially curative therapy prior malignancy , evidence disease 3 year deem negligible risk recurrence , eligible trial . 20 .
