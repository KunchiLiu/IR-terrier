	<brief_summary>This phase II clinical study include fifteen healthy light skin adult volunteer . At screen subject give sunburn test . This procedure involve expose eight 1 square cm area skin increase dos simulate solar radiation ( SSR ) . SSR deliver 1,000-Watt xenon arc lamp , emit ultraviolet wavelength 290-400 nm , closely resemble natural sunlight . The Minimal Erythema Dose ( MED ) determine approximately 24 hour initial exposure use chromometer . The MED calculate linear regression . Each test site one inch square area buttock low back . Sites 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 irradiate 2 MED SSR . Site 1 receive ACCS treatment . Sites 2 3 treated ACCS immediately irradiation . 8-12 hour later bedtime , Sites 2,3,4,5 ACCS home . ACCS also apply 24 hour SSR . Between 24-36 hour SSR , subject return Skin Study Center Minolta chromometer assessment erythema test site , well high resolution digital photography ( Canfield ) . These assessment repeat 48 hour 72 hour post SSR . Data graph quantify rate erythema resolution . Punch biopsy obtain Site 1 ( control ) Site 2 ( SSR + immediate ACCS Rx ) . If difference erythema observe Site 1 Site 4 , biopsy also obtain Site 4 ( SSR + delay ACCS Rx ) . Biopsy sample test use Reverse Transcriptase -Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT-PCR ) and/or immunohistochemistry marker UV inflammation Interleukin ( IL ) -6 , Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) -alpha , etc . Subjects continue apply ACCS twice daily Sites 3 5 study visit 5 . An additional normal control skin biopsy may perform subset volunteer ( 4-5 ) serve reference control tissue analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase II clinical study include ten fifteen healthy light skin adult volunteer recruit Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) -approved advertising . At screen subject give sunburn test . This procedure involve expose eight 1 square cm area skin increase dos simulate solar radiation ( SSR ) , rest body drape . SSR deliver 1,000-Watt xenon arc lamp , emit ultraviolet wavelength 290-400 nm , closely resemble natural sunlight . The Minimal Erythema Dose ( MED ) determine approximately 24 hour initial exposure use chromometer record value redness associate 1 square cm area expose SSR previous day . Once MED calculate linear regression , actual UV exposure test site conduct . A test site consist one inch square area buttock low back . Sites 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 irradiate 2 MED SSR rest body drape . Site 1 receive ACCS treatment . Sites 2 3 treated investigator ACCS immediately irradiation . 8-12 hour later bedtime , subject treat Sites 2,3,4,5 ACCS home . ACCS application also do subject Sites 2,3,4,5 next morning approximately 24 hour SSR . Between 24-36 hour SSR , subject return Skin Study Center Minolta chromometer assessment erythema test site , well high resolution digital photography ( Canfield ) . These assessment repeat 48 hour 72 hour post SSR data graph quantify rate erythema resolution . Punch biopsy obtain Site 1 ( control ) Site 2 ( SSR + immediate ACCS Rx ) . If difference erythema observe Site 1 Site 4 ( i.e . even delay treatment seem effectively decrease inflammation ) , biopsy also obtain Site 4 ( SSR + delay ACCS Rx ) . These biopsy sample test use RT-PCR and/or immunohistochemistry marker UV inflammation IL-6 , TNF-alpha , etc . The test sit biopsied long undergo chromometer assessment post biopsy inflammation biopsy may confound erythema reading . Meanwhile , subject continue apply ACCS twice daily Sites 3 5 study visit 5 . An additional normal control skin biopsy may perform subset volunteer ( 4-5 ) serve reference control tissue analysis . This required volunteer .</detailed_description>
