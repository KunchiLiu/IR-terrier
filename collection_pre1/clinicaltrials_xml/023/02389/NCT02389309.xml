	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level temsirolimus dasatinib base join study . Up 2 dose level drug test . Up 6 participant enrol group . The first group participant receive low dose level drug . If intolerable side effect see , next group receive high dose level temsirolimus . If intolerable side effect see second group , third group receive high dose level temsirolimus high dose level dasatinib . All participant receive dose level cyclophosphamide . Study Drug Administration : Every study cycle 28 day . You take tablet dasatinib 2 time day Days 1-21 cycle study , without food . Each dose take 12 hour apart . The tablet swallow whole , crushed broken . If unable swallow tablet whole , place allow dissolve 1 ounce lemonade , apple juice , orange juice ( note juice must preservative-free ) . You receive detailed instruction prepare liquid form dasatinib . You take tablet cyclophosphamide mouth 1 time day Days 1-21 cycle take second dose dasatinib . You receive temsirolimus vein 30-60 minute Days 1 , 8 , 15 cycle . Study Visits : Every week study , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Every week Cycle 1 , also physical exam urine collect routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam . - You EKG . - Urine blood collect routine test . On Day 15 Cycles 2 beyond , physical exam blood collect routine test . Every 2 cycle : - You MRI CT scan check status disease . - You ECHO , study doctor think need . - If study doctor think need , spinal tap compare earlier sample take . If study test show abnormal result , may need perform frequently . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study end-of-treatment visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 4 week stop receive study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You MRI CT scan check status disease . - If study doctor think need , spinal tap . This investigational study . Dasatinib FDA-approved commercially available treatment various type leukemia . Cyclophosphamide FDA-approved commercially available treatment several type cancer , include brain cancer many type blood cancer . Temsirolimus FDA-approved commercially available treatment kidney cancer . The use drug combination solid tumor investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 36 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
