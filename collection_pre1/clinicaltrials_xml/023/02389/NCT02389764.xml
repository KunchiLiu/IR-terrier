	<brief_title>Nintedanib For HER2-negative Metastatic Inflammatory Breast Cancer ( MIBC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 4 week . If find eligible take part study , take nintedanib capsule mouth 2 time day . Each dose 12 hour apart , time every day . The capsule swallow whole cup ( 8 ounce ) water within 30 minute eat meal . If forget take capsule 2 hour since schedule take dose , skip dose take next dose schedule . Do double next dose `` make '' miss one . You give study drug diary write take dose study drug . You need bring back empty partially use bottle study drug , along leftover study drug , clinic cycle . If experience side effect , give standard drug help decrease symptom side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Visits : All test procedure perform dose study drug . On Day 1 every cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 1-7 every odd-numbered cycle ( Cycles 9,11 , 13 , ) , physical exam blood draw perform MD Anderson . On Day 1 Cycles 8 every even-numbered cycle ( Cycles 10 , 12 , 14 , ) , physical exam blood draw may perform local clinic doctor 's office result send study doctor review . The study doctor discus option . On Day 1 Cycle 3 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) also draw biomarker test . On Day 1 Cycles 3 , 5 , 7 , every odd number cycle ( Cycles 9 , 11 , 13 , ) : - If doctor think need , photograph take area affected disease . - If doctor think need , x-ray , ultrasound , CT scan , PET/CT scan , and/or bone scan check status disease . At point doctor think need , EKG , ECHO , and/or MUGA scan . You may tests/procedures repeat well , doctor think need , check health . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 2 year . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete follow-up period . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 14 day last study visit : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - If doctor think need , photograph take skin area affect disease . - If doctor think need , x-ray , ultrasound , CT scan , PET/CT scan , and/or bone scan check status disease . - If doctor think need , EKG either ECHO MUGA scan . Follow-up Visits : You call member study staff every 3 month 1 year end-of-treatment visit ask . These call last 2 minute . This investigational study . Nintedanib commercially available FDA approve treatment certain type lung disease . Its use study investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 44 participant enrol study .
