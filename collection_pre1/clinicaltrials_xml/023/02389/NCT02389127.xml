	<detailed_description>Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , reliable test ass chronic glycemia recommend diagnosis monitoring T2DM , neither accurate reliable patient cirrhosis . A validation study perform define true usefulness set cirrhosis . The study aim determine level HbA1c good corresponds diagnosis T2DM - determine oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) - correlate level HbA1c average glucose 12-week period patient cirrhosis know T2DM , cirrhotic patient different degree liver impairment . This study design pilot , observational , cross-sectional ( Group A - cirrhotics T2DM ) longitudinal study ( Group B - cirrhotics know diabetes ) . For first aim ( Group A ) diagnostic yield HbA1c T2DM compare OGTT . Regarding second aim ( Group B ) HbA1c compare glucose read continuous glucose monitor . In group , follow study lab perform : fructosamine , Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) , liver function test , chemistry , International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) , pre albumin . A total 26 patient per group include . STUDY AIMS The study look three primary aim : 1 . To determine level HbA1c good corresponds diagnosis T2DM - determine OGTT - cirrhotic patient different degree liver impairment . - Will test hypothesis low level HbA1c find T2DM patient decompensated cirrhosis compare compensated disease . 2 . To correlate level HbA1c average glucose ( AG ) 12-week period patient cirrhosis know T2DM , accord different degree liver impairment . - Will test hypothesis progressively low level HbA1c associate hyperglycemia diabetic patient decompensated cirrhosis compare compensated disease . 3 . To compare performance continuous glucose monitoring , particularly level agreement AG 12-week period HbA1c , patient cirrhosis know T2DM control T2DM know chronic liver disease ( include cirrhosis ) . As secondary aim : 1 . Determine prevalence T2DM cirrhotics different degree liver disease accord use fasting glucose , HbA1c , OGTT . 2 . Determine level HbA1c good defines well-controlled diabetes patient cirrhosis know T2DM , accord different degree liver impairment . 3 . Glucose variability patient cirrhosis T2DM patient T2DM chronic liver disease ( include cirrhosis ) . Study Procedures All patient identify recruit Liver GI clinic Outpatient Center , UAMS . To test first aim ( Group A ) - cross-sectional part study - patient cirrhosis vary degree liver dysfunction prior diagnosis T2DM OGTT perform overnight fasting ( 8-12 hour ) . The OGTT consist take baseline glucose determination , follow second one 2 hour swallow 75-g glucose load . HbA1c obtain OGTT ( baseline glucose ) along follow test : HbA1c , fructosamine , insulin , CBC , HFP , GGT , OP Chem 7 , INR , prealbumin . Anthropometrics ( height , weight , waist circumference ) obtain well ( Research Visit 1 , see calendar ) . All patient identify recruit Liver GI clinic Outpatient Center , UAMS . For second aim ( Group B ) - longitudinal part study - patient know diabetes cirrhosis vary degree liver dysfunction wear continuous glucose monitor ( Dexcom , San Diego , CA ) ≥3 continuous day week day week end , every 4 week 12 consecutive week , accord manufacturer 's recommendation . The continuous glucose monitor record patient 's glucose odd even research visit ( i.e . 1 2 , 3 4 , 5 6 , 7 8 ) . On last day continuous glucose monitor retrieve investigator , patient follow blood test perform overnight fasting ( 8-12 hour ) : HbA1c , fructosamine , CBC , HFP , GGT , BMP , INR , prealbumin . Anthropometrics ( height , weight , waist circumference ) obtain well ( Research Visit 8 , see calendar ) . In order affect glucose control study period glucose read continuous glucose monitor disclose patient end study . All control identify Endocrinology Internal Medicine clinic Outpatient Center , UAMS . Controls wear continuous glucose monitor ( Dexcom , San Diego , CA ) ≥3 continuous day week day week end , every 4 week 12 consecutive week , accord manufacturer 's recommendation . The continuous glucose monitor record patient 's glucose odd even research visit ( i.e . 1 2 , 3 4 , 5 6 , 7 8 ) . On last day continuous glucose monitor retrieve investigator , patient follow blood test perform overnight fasting ( 8-12 hour ) : HbA1c , CBC , metabolic profile ; per standard care recommendation . Anthropometrics ( height , weight , waist circumference ) obtain well ( Research Visit 8 , see calendar - research visit occur day diabetes follow outpatient visit ) . In order affect glucose control study period glucose read continuous glucose monitor disclose patient end study . Given study attempt investigate accuracy HbA1c compare glucose biomarkers , specific therapeutic intervention recommendation concern treatment diabetes require study . Sample Size Since precedent literature show preliminary data allow sample calculation , include 30 patient CTP stag A , B , C , group . This number allow minimum need perform correlation analysis ( within group ) confidence . Sample Size Since precedent literature show preliminary data allow sample calculation , aim complete data 26 patient per group ( 10 CTP A , 8 CTP B , 8 CTP C group ) . However , give estimate attrition rate Group B 30 % , aim recruit 34 patient group . We plan recruit one control subject control B , number control would exceed 34 . Thus , total number subject study 94 . This number allow minimum need perform correlation analysis ( within group ) confidence . Data Analysis All glucose determination continuous glucose monitoring summarize arithmetic mean . Shapiro-Wilk used determine normal distribution data . Receiver operation characteristic ( ROC ) curve constructed determine best cut-off diagnose T2DM , use OGTT result gold standard . Spearman 's Pearson 's correlation coefficient use compare HbA1c average glucose ( eAG ) . Bland-Altman use determine agreement . The estimated average glucose HbA1c derive linear regression model , previously describe . Linear regression model perform identify factor affect HbA1c Groups A B , hemoglobin , CTP , MELD , total protein , prealbumin . CTP transform dummy variable analysis . Data collection handle Apart data generate study , demographic clinical information properly classify hepatic functional diabetes participant retrieve electronic medical record ( EMR ) . Such information include result standard care laboratory , imaging , special study ( EGD ) , calculate Child-Turcotte-Pugh ( CTP ) MELD score . A database create accumulate clinical information generate study . No identifier , apart name Date Birth ( DOB ) , collect . All data store database keep study folder create PI 's computer ( password-protected ) . Main database include identification ( ID ) assign , analytic table create , PHI remove table ( approval PI ) . Only de-identified dataset unique study ID 's used statistical analysis . Therefore , risk privacy individual minimize . The access research folder content restrict research staff list submission form . The PHI keep main database 10 year . The main database contain PHI keep study folder never transfer without de-identification data . No hard copy research data generate project . Risks Benefits The risk associate venipuncture repeat blood collection vein minor bleeding , bruising , infection ( small risk time skin broken ) , need one attempt locate vein . There risk OGTT , although subject may like taste highly concentrate glucose beverage . Occasionally someone may low blood sugar high blood sugar test . Blood glucose monitor test . Some risk associate Dexcom G4 System Device report : placing device skin may cause anxiety , pain , irritation , redness , swell . There also risk infection , excessive bleeding , hematoma ( swell fill blood cause broken blood vessel ) - risk rare . Removing sensor may also cause discomfort irritation tape use . This reaction usually go away within hour , may last week . There may itch area , normal heal response . In rare case , sensor may break insert . If happens , study team examine area . Sometimes study team may decide leave sensor fragment place . If redness , pain , infection , study team decide treat . You try remove sensor broken unless study team tell . University Arkansas ( UAMS ) firewall use specific research purpose project . Aggregated data analyze publish , specific data element make available . Further , subject forfeit right participate - health care eligibility health benefit affect way . Although breach confidentiality always risk collect personal information patient , believe small give system develop obtain handle data .
