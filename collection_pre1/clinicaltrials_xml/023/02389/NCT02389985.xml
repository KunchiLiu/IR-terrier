	<brief_summary>The purpose study estimate maximum tolerated dos ( MTD ) CRLX101 administer combination weekly paclitaxel woman recurrent persistent , epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . Determine pharmacokinetic evaluation ( sometimes describe body drug , refers movement drug , body-the time course absorption , bioavailability , distribution , metabolism , excretion ) whether disposition paclitaxel affect concurrent administration CRLX101 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study CRLX101 Combination With Weekly Paclitaxel Patients With Recurrent Persistent Epithelial Ovarian , Fallopian Tube Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrent ovarian cancer represent therapeutic challenge . Patients resistant disease , show progression within six month platinum-containing therapy , poor prognosis , median overall survival ( OS ) approximately 12 months.Ultimately patient recurrent disease ultimately develop platinum resistance , novel strategy need . In set active agent pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( PLD ) , paclitaxel topotecan . Multiple trial demonstrate combination therapy produce increase toxicity without improved efficacy . This study propose examine combination CRLX101 combination weekly paclitaxel . Preclinical study show synergistic activity SKOV3 human ovarian cancer xenograft ovarian cancer cell line ( 14 ) , well vivo ( 15,16 ) , perhaps via antiangiogenic mechanism .</detailed_description>
