	<brief_summary>ANGPTL3 ANGPTL8 emerge molecule involve lipid metabolism . In previous vivo study use mouse , ANGPTL8 regulate activation ANGPTL3 know inhibit lipoprotein lipase activity stimulate lipolysis adipose tissue . Besides , glypican 4 identify novel adipokine modulate adipocyte differentiation . Thus , investigator postulate different serum concentration ANGPTL3 , ANGPTL8 glypican 4 might affect progression obesity child . The investigator measure molecules Korean child , investigate association molecule development obesity .</brief_summary>
