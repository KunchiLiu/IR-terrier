	<brief_summary>This study design study DNA sequencings mutation research genetic test panel gene ( contain 32 know and/or publish gene associate PCD ) . The study aim show 70 % PCD patient biallelic mutation one gene . This project enroll patient already clinical evaluation , clinical feature consistent PCD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetics Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator establish Consortium 9 geographically-dispersed clinical research site study rare disease airway , include Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia ( PCD ) . PCD genetic disorder defective mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) , sinus pulmonary disease chronic infection , organ locate wrong side body 50 % patient ( Kartagener Syndrome ) . Lung disease occur early child PCD , establish diagnosis remain major challenge , base traditional approach use electron microscopy and/or ciliary waveform analysis define abnormality ciliary ultrastructure and/or function . For study , blood buccal sample DNA collect genetic testing patient know suspected PCD perform . This study include term neonate respiratory distress unknown etiology feature PCD , particular laterality defect ( situs inversus heterotaxy ) . The key hypothesis study genetic test panel 32 gene confirm diagnosis patient PCD .</detailed_description>
