	<brief_summary>Background Hemophilia sex-linked genetic disorder . When joint muscle bleed , may cause haemarthrosis , synovium , cartilage tissue thickening , joint activity ( Range Motion ) decrease musculoskeletal related disorder . Patients produce pain action , compensatory action occur , thus cause recurrent bleeding , joint damage . There high rate ankle joint bleed hemophilia . The ankle articular joint disease affect low limb activity , functional activity impair . Review study , addition physical therapy , Kinesio tap common intervention improve subject ' static balance , proprioception , functional ankle stability , correct poor posture . The main intervention study physical therapy Kinesio taping , expect improve stability muscular strength low extremity , balance , correct gait low extremity functional activity subject hemophilia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Functional Activities Balance Ability With Taping Subjects Hemophilia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : This study randomize control trial , subject randomly divide two group , control group receive physical therapy week period three month ; experimental group receive physical therapy addition treatment , accept Kinesio tap . Experiments group carry relevant test , include : muscle strength , balance , low extremity functional activity . The participant follow duration physical therapy , expect average 3 month .</detailed_description>
