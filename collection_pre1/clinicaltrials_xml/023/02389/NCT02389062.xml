	<brief_summary>This clinical trial evaluate sensitivity noninvasive , novel marker gluten ingestion celiac disease patient follow gluten free diet least period one year . These noninvasive marker may helpful monitor silent intestinal damage , possibly result accidental consumption gluten due cross contamination gluten free diet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The gold-standard monitoring dietary adherence consultation expert dietitian , may time-consuming patient local expertise may available . Intestinal biopsy direct method document mucosal heal consider adult celiac disease . Non-invasive assessment compliance gluten free diet ( GFD ) achieve monitor IgA antibody tissue transglutaminase ( IgA-tTG ) deamidated gliadin peptide , marker improve gluten elimination . However , intestinal mucosal damage present significant number patient report compliance gluten free diet normalized serology , potentially due dietary lapse unrecognized contamination gluten . Furthermore , serologic testing may normal patient partial adherence . Patient report survey show promise assess gluten free diet adherence , study need . Intestinal fatty acid-binding protein ( I-FABP ) , small ( 15 kD ) cytosolic protein find exclusively small bowel enterocytes , study marker intestinal epithelial damage septic shock mesenteric ischemia . More recently , elevate level intestinal fatty acid-binding protein ( I-FABP ) describe marker intestinal injury adult child celiac disease . Intestinal fatty acid bind protein , ( I-FABP ) level show significantly correlate degree villous atrophy IgA antibody tissue transglutaminase ( IgA-tTG ) , well decrease upon treatment gluten free diet ( GFD ) . Incomplete normalization intestinal fatty acid bind protein ( I-FABP ) gluten free diet point ongoing intestinal injury , even absence circulate antibody , thus suggest potential non-invasive marker gluten free diet adherence intestinal damage celiac disease . The measurement gluten immunogenic peptide ( GIP ) stool novel method monitor gluten free diet compliance . Recently , technique detect gliadin 33-mer equivalent peptide epitope ( 33EPs ) stool pediatric patient describe . These peptide show significant resistance digestion detect healthy individual normal gluten-containing diet ingestion . Importantly , peptide detect patient gluten free diet , appear correlation amount gluten intake peptide level . A similar test develop gluten intestinal peptide ( GIP ) detection urine , although currently peer-reviewed study examine technique . Further research utility stool urine gluten intestinal peptide ( GIP ) monitoring gluten free diet ( GFD ) adherence warrant . Given lack non-invasive accurate measure gluten intake celiac disease ( CD ) , investigator investigate effect gluten intake celiac disease ( CD ) patient use variety marker . Patients symptom-free gluten free diet ( GFD ) expose various amount gluten . Factors study include effect patient estimate gluten intake , Celiac disease symptom , IgA-tTG level , intestinal fatty acid bind protein ( I-FABP ) level , stool urine gluten peptide level .</detailed_description>
