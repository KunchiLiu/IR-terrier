	<brief_summary>Lymphomas classify Hodgkin 's non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , especially latter represent heterogeneous group vary pattern prognosis , biological behaviour response treatment . 18F-FDG PET/CT useful stag response monitoring disadvantage associate radiation exposure may desirable young patient . Advanced MRI technique include diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) increasingly use improve lesion detection characterisation lymphomas whole-body mode offer promise radiation-free alternative CT. Molecular image turn important theranostics medicine detection therapeutic target essential . The concept theranostics successfully adapt management neuroendocrine tumor ( NET ) peptide receptor radiotherapy ( PRRT ) offer patient progress treatment long-acting somatostatin analogue . Recently investigator 's hospital case diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) initially misdiagnosed NET high uptake 68Ga-DOTANOC pancreatic tumor PET/CT . A PubMed search reveal similar case report bronchial tumor turn DLBCL ( Jain et al . Clin Nucl Med 2014 ; 39:358-359 ) . Bearing two case mind investigator aim systematically study somatostatin receptor status ( ssr ) measure uptake 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT patient newly diagnose non-Hodgkin 's Hodgkin 's lymphoma . The imaging finding compare immunohistochemically determine ssr-subtypes 2,3 5 obtain pre-treatment fresh tumor sample 18F-FDG PET/CT part standard diagnostic evaluation . Furthermore , whole-body MRI DWI perform , chemotherapy define sensitive specific image method appropriate routine diagnosis follow-up . This study potential implication future response monitor follow-up image technique patient malignant lymphoma provide additional biologic characterization may useful novel therapeutic approach PRRT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lymphomas malignant tumour immune system . Lymphomas classify Hodgkin 's non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas several subtypes . In Finland amount newly diagnose Hodgkin 's lymphomas 120-150 new case per year account 12 % lymphoma . Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma sixth common cancer men eight common cancer woman Finland . There approximately 1200 new case per year incidence increase last decade . ( 1 , 2 ) Etiology lymphomas mostly unknown many risk factor identify . Diagnostics classification different subgroup base clinical , pathological , molecular , radiological study . Some lymphoma 's subtypes cure current treatment method , however , many remain still incurable . ( 1 ) Clearly , accurate diagnostic tool subsequent targeted therapy lymphomas need . Somatostatin receptor ( SSTs ) express wide variety different tumour cell type , include malignant lymphoma . ( 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ) Somatostatin receptor image octreotide scintigraphy show sensitivity 95-100 % Hodgkin 's lymphoma 80 % non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . However , somatostatin receptor scintigraphy appear significant role diagnostic process relatively low uptake use somatostatin analogue ( octreotide ) limited sensitivity single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) acquisition detect localise small involved node . ( 11 , 25 ) Hence , somatostatin receptor image develop advent hybrid SPECT positron emission tomography ( PET ) compute tomography ( CT ) scanner . Several radioligands study improve bind affinity ( 15 ) . This also offer new target tumor cell-specific therapy use different somatostatin analog label therapeutic radionuclides 90Y-DOTATOC , somatostatin receptor subtype 2 ( SST2 ) -specific ligand . Clinical study peptide receptor radionuclide therapy ( PRRT ) extensively focused neuroendocrine tumor palliative treatment modality ( 12 , 13 , 14 ) . Another new candidate SST base image treatment 68Ga-DOTANOC , high-affinity ligand somatostatin receptor subtypes 2 , 3 5 ( SST2 , SST3 , SST5 ) ( 16 ) . Neuroendocrine tumor know express SST2 show high uptake radiolabeled somatostatin analog PET . However , lymphoma may mimick NETs DOTANOC PET/CT show recent case report ( 17 ) . Therefore , study SST2 status DOTANOC uptake order establish role peptide base image diagnosis possible PRRT lymphoma . The aim study determine tumor uptake 68Ga-DOTANOC patient non-Hodgkin 's Hodgkin 's lymphoma characterize SST2 , SST3 SST5 receptor status tumour vivo 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT . In addition , immunohistochemical analysis SST2 , SST3 SST5 subtype status make tumor specimen obtain routine diagnostic biopsy resection . Furthermore , PET finding correlate advanced MRI technique , diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) attempt find method limit radiation exposure especially young patient . Hence , PET/CT perform 68Ga-DOTANOC 18F-FDG compare whole-body MRI ( include DWI ) define sensitive specific image method appropriate routine diagnosis follow-up patient lymphoma . To investigator knowledge , prospective study compare octreodite analogue base PET/CT image standard diagnostic procedure publish . PET/CT offer clear advantage scintigraphy term sensitivity resolution helpful determine SST status various histologic form lymphomas The investigator hypothesize positive 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT scan correlate overexpression SST subtypes lymphomas , possibly link indolent behavior disease . Furthermore , hypothesize 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT image provide valid method select patient lymphoma radionuclide therapy 177Lu-DOTATATE . Third , differential diagnosis NETs may also improve receive information SST status lymphoma . Thus finding study may useful biologic characterization also diagnosis management heterogenous disease originate lymphatic system</detailed_description>
