	<brief_title>Identification Novel Molecular Markers Cerebral Ischemia From Patients With Minor Devastating Ischemic Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemic stroke one top cause morbidity mortality United States . Despite great deal effort improve outcome patient ischemic cerebral stroke , lack bona fide animal model representative cerebral ischemia man make study pathological process involve difficult . Additionally , subtle significant difference biology animal model biology human make translatability animal result human difficult . The purpose study use iatrogenic model stroke , mean stroke inadvertently cause endovascular coil elective aneurysm , study biology stroke human . Clinical evidence suggest simple catheterization cerebral vasculature cause small , usually clinically silent , embolic stroke . These stroke evident MRI scan . Additionally , since practitioner know onset interventional procedure , default know time injury . This simple model allow one study stroke real-time knowledge time onset . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evaluation allow practitioner identify volume stroke cause intervention . Alternatively , patient present emergency room large ischemic infarct provide natural control population study . These patient present large , usually devastate stroke . In case time onset deficit know . The investigator propose use simple model ischemia endovascular intervention obvious devastate case ischemic stroke present emergency room well understand molecular pathway involve stroke . Rationale : Global analysis biological marker establish mechanism study complex disease process . The introduction microarray technology system wide analysis improve understanding various biological disease process . This revolution ongoing since early 1990 's . The rationale perform study augment understand basic mechanism stroke human . As previously mention , bona fide model stroke researcher ' experimental design provide rather simple human model cerebral ischemia . The study require four blood draw , 5 mL volume ; blood draw time normal time blood draw patient would experience place patient additional risk . The blood sample analyze follow : total ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) , include microRNA fraction , protein isolate quantified blood sample . The researcher load RNA sample onto Febit microRNA array . The Febit miRNA chip know human miRNAs miRNA star sequence Sanger 's miRBase 14 . With platform total RNA load directly onto array . There RNA label amplification step . miRNA hybridization chip follow microfluidic primer extension assay . In case , hybridization correct miRNA probe allow primer extension step proceed efficiently , give array high sensitivity specificity . In addition , researcher create custom microarrays , add several spike-in control . Our spike-ins provide feedback variability RNA isolation additional signal array normalization . The protein fraction analyze use Ray Biotech 's Quantibody Arrays . These array antibody design capture specific protein specie ( researcher target approximately 120 unique protein ) fully quantitative fashion . These array essentially function traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) glass slide substrate . The assay offer several advantage ELISA 's , include requirement low amount sample input , perhaps importantly , facilitate quantitative investigation hundred proteins therefore greatly accelerate ability search identify protein-based signature and/or biomarkers . The data statistically analyze use statistical tool deem appropriate time data analysis investigator TGen Dr. Kalani . Drs . Kalani Nakaji correlate identity quantity identify molecular marker , temporal appearance , concentration , disappearance collect clinical data . A neuroradiologist perform evaluation interpretation computerize axial tomography ( CT ) /MRI scan collect subject 's inpatient stay outpatient visit . The neuroradiologist recording size caliber blood vessel , look malformation , dissection , aneurysm , abnormality . The researcher also correlate level identify marker well patient performs upon discharge hospital followup two year discharge , use Modified Rankin Scale score Glasgow Outcome Scale ( GOS ) . As part followup , researcher assess time return work ( applicable ) , complaint , result followup laboratory ( complete blood count , coagulation study , response anti-platelet medication include aspirin resistance assay p2yp12 assay , basic metabolic panel ) imaging , update complete history physical identify new condition may result post-ischemia . This information collect time followup neurosurgeon . Once do , candidate microRNA protein identify , researcher share result ( manner excludes patient specific information ) collaborator ( Department Health Human Services associate organization NIH ) .</detailed_description>
