	<criteria>Inclusion criterion The patient ( ) MPP seek meet follow : Is suffer serious lifethreatening disease condition Does access comparable satisfactory alternative treatment ( i.e. , comparable satisfactory treatment available exist ) Patient optimize standard care treatment , include treatment ARBs ACEI , betablockers MRA ; Intolerance evidencebased target dos document treat physician Meets relevant medical criterion compassionate use investigational product Patients eligible inclusion program fulfill follow criterion : 1 . Adult patient ( young 18 year old ) include , upon completion write informed consent assessment perform . 2 . Patients diagnosis CHF NYHA class IIIV reduce ejection fraction : • LVEF ≤ 35 % time screening participation program ( local measurement , make within past 6 month use echocardiography , MUGA , CT scanning , MRI ventricular angiography acceptable , provided subsequent measurement 35 % ) 3 . Patient hospitalization HF within last 12 month 4 . Patients must ACEI ARB stable dose least 4 week prior start treatment LCZ696 5 . Patients must treat βblocker , unless contraindicate tolerated , stable dose least 4 week prior start treatment LCZ696 ( reason document patient CHF target dos per local guideline , absence medication ) . 6 . An aldosterone antagonist also consider patient , take account renal function , serum potassium tolerability .
