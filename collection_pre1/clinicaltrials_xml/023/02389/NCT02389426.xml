	<detailed_description>MS poorly understand chronic disease central nervous system characterize focal inflammatory demyelinate lesion diffuse axonal degeneration . Recent magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study demonstrate widespread decrease cerebral perfusion - express cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) - throughout normal-appearing white matter patient MS , seem secondary axonal degeneration reduce metabolic demand , contrast may actively contribute MS pathology . Reduced CBF MS mediate elevated level potent vasoconstrictive agent endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) , likely release cerebral circulation reactive astrocyte , reverse administration ET-1 antagonist bosentan . Phase-contrast MRI recently demonstrate reduced cervical arterial blood flow velocity brain patient MS compare control subject . The aim study investigate potential TCD NIRS , simple non-invasive bedside method , evaluate change cerebral circulation patient MS control subject . A baseline TCD examination perform subject ( MS patient control ) temporal bone window side . Middle cerebral artery wave form identify depth range 40-60 mm stable forward waveform good intensity select . TCD probe ( 2 MHz ) mount head frame ensure constant angle insonation throughout procedure . Mean , peak-systolic end-diastolic blood flow velocity directly record machine . Blood pressure ( BP ) heart rate measure finger plethysmograph . The cuff apply middle finger leave hand , first place heart level calibrate system , afterwards hand place next subject rest . Near-infrared spectroscopy perform measure cerebral frontal lobe oxygen saturation . NIRS perform two large sensor , attach patient 's forehead bilaterally . In bright environment , light-blocker cover sensor use reduce interference ambient light . Continuously NIRS record 2 interval refreshment . Measurements do upright supine position . The expected duration entire TCD protocol 30 minute . The TCD examination repeat patient MS ( i.e . control subject ) 4 h oral intake 62.5 mg bosentan ( TracleerÂ® ) ( peak plasma concentration expect ) . This purely academic study Bosentan purchase hospital pharmacy . The common side effect daily treatment bosentan hepatotoxicity . Adverse reaction one single dose unlikely . The primary aim investigate potential TCD evaluate change cerebral circulation patient MS control . Bosentan object investigation study consider 'Non Investigational Medicinal Product ' ( N.I.M.P. ) . Patients MS receive product increase CBF , effect already demonstrate early perfusion-weighted MRI study . Fifteen patient relapsing-remitting progressive MS 15 healthy control , match sex age , include study . Sample size calculation base number inclusion previous study regard cerebral hemodynamic parameter MS ( mostly 10 30 ) . The statistical analysis conduct Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) software . Mann Whitney U Wilcoxon sign rank test use appropriate .</detailed_description>
