	<brief_summary>This single-centre , open-label , dose find study use induced blood stage malaria ( IBSM ) infection characterize pharmacodynamic interaction OZ439 DSM265 , administer around 120 minute apart treatment early Plasmodium falciparum blood stage infection . The study conduct three cohort ( n=8 per cohort ) use different dos OZ439 DSM265 . The dos OZ439 DSM265 investigate first cohort 200 mg OZ439 100mg DSM265 , administer single dos around 120 minute apart . Subsequent dose subsequent cohort ( ) determine follow review observe OZ439 DSM265 safety , pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic interaction outcome , particularly antimalarial activity drug give combination define parasite clearance kinetics . The dos use Cohort 2 3 may adjust exceed maximum acceptable dos predefined study ( 400 mg DSM265 500mg OZ439 ) determine previous safety pilot efficacy study . The dose determine funding sponsor principal investigator ( PI ) follow Safety Review team ( SRT ) scientific evaluation . If safe alternative dose determine option exists curtail study less three cohort . Each participant cohort inoculate Day 0 ~1,800 viable parasite Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocyte ( BSPC ) administer intravenously . On outpatient basis , participant monitor daily via phone call daily ( AM ) day 4 ( PCR positive presence malaria parasite ) . Once PCR positive monitor twice-daily morning ( AM ) evening ( PM ) treatment , adverse event unexpected early onset symptom , sign parasitological evidence malaria . On day designate commencement treatment , determine qPCR result , participant admit study unit monitor . The threshold commencement treatment PCR quantification participant = 1,000 parasites/mL . If PCR quantification participant = 5,000 parasites/mL accompany clinical symptom score &gt; 5 , clinical parasitological evidence malaria occur participant participant reach treatment threshold ( PCR quantification = 1,000 ) , treatment participant begin within 24 h period . Following treatment OZ439 DSM265 , participant follow inpatient least 48 hour ensure tolerance treatment clinical response , clinically well outpatient basis safety clearance malaria parasites via PCR . Compulsory commencement treatment Riamet® ( artemether-lumefantrine ) occur study day 16 ±3 day post OZ439 DSM265 treatment unless require earlier . Early standard anti-malarial drug intervention occur either poor response fast response see follow OZ439 DSM265 treatment . This ensure participant safety avoid participant inconvenience useful data obtain . A poor response define decrease parasitaemia le 20 % baseline 3 day post OZ439 DSM265 treatment . A fast response occur , within seven day period follow treatment , two consecutive PCR assessment 48 hour negative . However , pre-emptive treatment Riamet® commence whenever deem necessary investigator . Participants monitor , either clinic , telephone three day ensure adherence Riamet® therapy . Participants treat single dose ( 45 mg ) primaquine describe section 4.3 protocol end Riamet® treatment gametocyte identify , ensure complete clearance gametocyte present . Adverse event monitor via telephone monitoring , within clinical research unit , outpatient review malaria challenge inoculation antimalarial study drug administration . Blood sample safety evaluation , malaria monitoring , red blood cell antibody draw screen and/ baseline nominate time malaria challenge .</brief_summary>
