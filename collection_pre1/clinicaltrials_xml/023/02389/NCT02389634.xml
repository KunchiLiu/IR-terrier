	<brief_title>Identification Novel Molecular Markers Vasospasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral vasospasm recognize poorly understood complication many patient aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage . Constriction cerebral arterial vasculature occur free subarachnoid blood high pressure come contact surface vessel , particularly basal cistern . However , exact pathophysiology vasospasm unknown . Morbidity mortality rate vasospasm high despite improvement management . Excluding initial hemorrhage , cerebral vasospasm recognize main cause substantial disability death . Cerebral vasospasm kill 7 % patient , cause severe deficit another 7 % . Cerebral vasospasm almost never occur day 3 , maximal incidence day 6-8 , rarely occur day 17 . The disorder clinically characterize confusion decrease consciousness focal neurological deficit . Experimental evidence suggest red blood cell hemolysis subsequent release oxygen , hemoglobin , reactive oxygen specie , yet undescribed mediator necessary development vasospasm . The goal study use modern tool genomics identify novel molecular marker process vasospasm study release micro ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) secrete cerebrospinal fluid follow initiation vasospastic cascade . Micro RNA 's recently identify important regulator many cellular process include cell cycle progression , proliferation , tumor suppressor , oncogene , regulator metabolic pathway . The researcher propose study level annotate micro RNA 's cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) patient present subarachnoid hemorrhage presentation hospital stay . The researcher correlate level micro RNA 's patient clinical presentation , include transcranial Doppler measurement , Glasgow Coma Scale score , vital sign , angiographic study . It well establish process vasospasm occur course many day . Long vasospasm become clinically evident , cellular process cause spasm action researcher hope identify micro RNA mediator process use high throughput screen method .</detailed_description>
