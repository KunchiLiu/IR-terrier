	<brief_summary>Introduction- Hospital acquire infection ( HAI ) major cause morbidity mortality increase health care cost . Critically ill patient particularly susceptible infection even high mortality . One intervention gain much interest medical literature reduce infection rate deaths HAIs selective decontamination digestive tract ( SDD ) . SDD involve application antibiotic paste mouth , throat , stomach short course intravenous antibiotic . The evidence support use SDD save life prevent infection actually quite strong . However , health care professional many part world refrain use SDD due fear effect overuse antibiotic frequency infection resistant bacteria multi-resistant Gram negative organism , MRSA Clostridium difficile . SuDDICU-ANZ cross-over , cluster randomise trial compare effect use selective decontamination digestive tract ( SDD ) plus standard care , standard care alone hospital mortality patient receive mechanical ventilation intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Secondary outcome include ecological assessment long-term health economic analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design- A bi-national , multicentre , crossover , cluster randomise control trial ( x-cRCT ) eligible patient participate ICUs use two 12-month interventional trial period separate 3-month inter-period gap . An observational ecological assessment conduct eligible patient two 12-month intervention period patient admit participate ICUs first week month three 3-month surveillance period , inter-period gap second 12-month interventional period . Participants- General ICUs admit mechanically ventilated patient randomise first 12-month period either implement SDD protocol addition standard care continue standard care without SDD , cross arm second 12-month period . Eligible patient define : 1 . All patient mechanically ventilate via endotracheal tube admission ICU predict remain ventilated beyond end calendar day day ICU admission , 2 . All patient become mechanically ventilated via endotracheal tube ICU stay predict remain ventilated beyond end calendar day day first ventilate , 3 . All patient already recruit receive mechanical ventilation via endotracheal tube expect receive ongoing ventilation 48-hours despite early prediction ventilation would discontinue early . Intervention- In SDD arm , eligible patient receive : 1 . A six-hourly topical application 0.5g paste contain colistin 2 % , tobramycin 2 % nystatin 2 % , buccal mucosa oropharynx 2 . A six-hourly administration 10 mL suspension contain 100 mg colistin , 80 mg tobramycin 2 x 106 IU nystatin , gastrointestinal tract via gastric/post-pyloric tube 3 . A four-day course intravenous ( IV ) antibiotic . Patients already receive therapeutic antibiotic prescribe cefotaxime 1g six-hourly ceftriaxone 1g daily , dose adjust appropriate organ dysfunction . Ciprofloxacin ( 400mg 12-hourly ) may use alternative contraindication cephalosporin , allergy . Patients already receive alternative IV antibiotic clinically indicate receive additional IV antibiotic , continue prescribe antibiotic usual duration therapy . Statistical consideration sample size- SuDDICU-ANZ recruit 8,000 patient 25-30 ICUs able detect 3.6-3.7 % absolute reduction hospital mortality baseline mortality 29 % , use 80 % power , Î± &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Site inclusion cluster study A general ICU complex ICUs ( medical , surgical , mixed ) capable treat mechanically ventilate critically ill adult patient . Patient inclusion criterion 1 . All patient mechanically ventilate via endotracheal tube admission ICU predict remain ventilated beyond end calendar day day ICU admission , 2 . All patient become mechanically ventilated via endotracheal tube ICU stay predict remain ventilated beyond end calendar day day first ventilate , 3 . All patient already recruit receive mechanical ventilation via endotracheal tube expect receive ongoing ventilation 48 hour despite early prediction ventilation would discontinue early . Site exclusion criterion cluster study 1 . Unwilling unable follow trial protocol . 2 . Unable capture minimum data set require study . 3 . Isolated specialty ICUs colocated general ICU , solely cardiac , neurological/neurosurgical burn ICUs , specialty patient care general ICUs include 4 . Specialty paediatric ICUs Patient exclusion criterion 1 . Patients enrolled trial would interact intervention 2 . Patients know allergy , sensitivity interaction trial topical intervention drug 3 . Patients know suspected pregnant 4 . Patients moribund expect survive next 12 hour 5 . Patients le 16 year age enrol New Zealand</criteria>
