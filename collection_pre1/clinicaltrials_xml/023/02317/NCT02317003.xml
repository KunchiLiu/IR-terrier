	<brief_title>Physical Exercise Prescription With PEdometeR General Practice Patients With Cardiovascular Risk Factors - The PEPPER Pragmatic Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Health benefit physical activity show least important drug therapy prevention cardiovascular disease patient hypertension , hyperlipidaemia diabetes . However , strategy demonstrate efficacy practicality promotion physical exercise among high risk patient general practice . The PEPPER clinical study pragmatic randomise trial period 12 month evaluate efficacy , term physical activity level , intervention base structure information delivery accord cognitive behavioural theory , personalise write physical activity prescription number step per day , pedometer , pedometer logbook similar diabetes logbook , 35 74 year old patient cardiovascular risk factor . This strategy compare commonly used oral recommendation physical activity . The primary outcome change total energy expenditure measure accelerometry 7-day period . Secondary outcome include change physical activity level ( International Physical Activity Questionnaire ) , quality life ( SF-36 ) , blood pressure , weight , waist circumference , perceive obstacle physical activity , patient doctor compliance suggest strategy . 140 patient recruit follow 15 GP practice . Measures assess baseline , 3 month 12 month ( end intervention ) . The result PEPPER study expect end 2016 . If intervention prove effective increase durably level physical activity , relatively simple cheap strategy could help decrease occurrence cardiovascular event large high-risk population see general practice .</detailed_description>
