	<brief_title>SteadyRx : Smartphone ART Adherence Intervention Drug Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) increase life expectancy quality life individual infect HIV , reduce chance HIV transmission . These fantastic personal public health benefit require high level adherence prescribe treatment regimen . High rate virologic suppression achieve adherence rate 90 % , adherence 95 % appear produce best combination high probability virologic suppression low probability development resistance medication . Unfortunately , 59 % patient North America report ART adherence &gt; 90 % . Thus , ART adherence intervention critical part fight HIV/AIDS , substantial need novel effective ART adherence intervention . Injection drug use crack cocaine use major factor transmission HIV associate non-adherence ART . Several type intervention effective promote short-term ART adherence population . Counseling strategy reminder ( e.g. , beeper , calendar , etc . ) modest effect . Still successful approach include directly administer antiretroviral therapy ( DAART , patient observe care provider take medication ) , medication assist therapy ( e.g. , methadone maintenance ) , contingency management ( monetary incentive maintain adherence HIV medication ) . However , core problem ART adherence intervention effect appear last intervention discontinue . In recent review ART adherence intervention drug user , researcher express concern `` virtual lack intervention sustain post-intervention adherence virologic benefit . '' The common find post-intervention dissipation effect suggest ART adherence intervention may need implement long-term even permanent adjunct ART drug user . We seek develop intensive intervention incorporates effective technique promote ART adherence drug user , deliver manner allow large-scale implementation long-term even permanent adjunct ART . We propose three year development project ART adherence intervention bundle target group effective component intervention Smartphone application easy patient use , simple manage , maximally convenient stakeholder . Toward end , intervention develop project ( 1 ) facilitate consultation care provider ( 2 ) provide reminder dose overdue , ( 3 ) provide remote electronic observation medication-taking , ( 4 ) provide incentive ART adherence . The propose intervention ( SteadyRx ) highly innovative : previous ART adherence intervention involve direct observation medication administration contingency management , despite respective effectiveness isolation . Importantly , mobile/remote intervention currently development intensive SteadyRx . The developmental process application begin modification exist technology , follow conduct focus group intend target population well physician , primary care staff , health administrator , respectively , order enhance adoptability intervention include application function interface design sensitive need stakeholder . Small scale test member target population use refine application produce beta version use pilot randomize control trial . In pilot study , 50 HIV+ adult substance use disorder randomly assign receive either usual care service primary care facility service plus SteadyRx intervention . The project follow Specific Aims : 1 . Develop SteadyRx Smartphone intervention HIV+ drug user 1 . Conduct focus group target population , physician , primary care staff , health administrator , respectively , prior create application instructional material 2 . Create alpha version smartphone application relate instructional material 3 . Create beta version application use pilot randomize control trial . 2 . Implement SteadyRx pilot randomize control trial 1 . Evaluate SteadyRx 's acceptability stakeholder , user experience , user engagement . 2 . Collect preliminary data effectiveness SteadyRx improve ART adherence , reduce viral load , promote high CD4 count 3 . Collect preliminary assessment association ongoing drug use health literacy effectiveness SteadyRx . Overall , combination consultation , reminder , direct observation , incentives adherence , deliver long-term adjunct ART via Smartphone application could prove maximally effective practical mean realize fantastic potential modern ART improve life individual HIV/AIDS reduce rate HIV transmission high-risk patient . STUDY PROCEDURES Application Development Alpha Version . As first step development application , create alpha version application include PillWatch feature . Note PillWatch feature require minor modification exist M≈çtiv8 technology use Dallery ( Co-I ) . Other aspect plan application require substantial development thus fully developed focus group session describe . Focus Groups . As second step development application , conduct three focus group session . All focus group design moderate Baltimore Research , full service marketing research company 50 year experience ( See Facilities Other Resources detail ) . Baltimore Research also handle data collection analysis focus group session provide study team final report session . Each focus group include relatively homogeneous set stakeholder : Physicians/primary care staff , health administrator ( e.g. , see Priority Partners letter support ) , patient , respectively . All focus group include approximately eight participant , identify ideal number participant focus group session . In order ensure approximately eight participant include , attempt recruit least 10 participant , participant must show time specific schedule session , usually result people agree participate show scheduled time . These group hold one-time session design generate idea enhance application 's usability adoptability perspective professional likely involved institutional decision making process relevant dissemination propose intervention . We anticipate recruitment health professional straightforward give extensive connection professional throughout local health care system Baltimore , consultation Baltimore Research ensure recruitment process free bias . The third focus group session ( patient ) begin iterative process first solicit idea functionality interface application . Participants focus group recruit use method identical describe pilot randomize control trial . Create Beta Version . Following initial four focus group session , beta version application create critical feature describe . The end product part development process beta version use pilot study describe . PILOT STUDY We expect participant patient Comprehensive Care Practice ( CCP ) . CCP locate Mason F. Lord Building Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center Baltimore , MD . CCP provide primary medical care ~450 HIV+ adult serve recruitment site . Participants recruit regularly schedule HIV care appointment CCP current viral load CD4 count evaluate . Any HIV+ patient substance use disorder tell CCP doctor research study give recruitment flyer explain benefit participation . If express interest , doctor immediately contact CCP Medical Case Manager charge study recruitment assessment ( hereafter , outreach coordinator ) . The outreach coordinator briefly explain intake interview process basic purpose study . If patient agrees move forward begin formal consent process . During process , outreach coordinator read consent form aloud entirety participant follow along . After sign consent form , patient proceed immediately intake interview unless schedule precludes , case provide contact information schedule intake interview time next day soon possible . Participants sign consent return CCP give reminder call relate scheduled intake interview . They also receive follow call fail show schedule appointment time . For give pilot study participant , study participation last six month , include intake visit plus six visit 30 day interval thereafter . For focus group participant , study participation consist single focus group session .</detailed_description>
