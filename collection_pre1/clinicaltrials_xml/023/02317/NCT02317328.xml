	<brief_summary>Background : - By time disease retina detect , serious damage often already do . Researchers want find good way view retina . One way call adaptive optic may help detect problem earlier . Objectives : - To study adaptive optic help find good way diagnose , treat , manage retinal disease . Eligibility : - People age 12 eye disease . - Healthy volunteer age 12 20/20 vision well . Design : - Participants screen medical history eye exam . These may include dilate pupil take picture eye . - Participants 1 study visit . They : - Medical eye history . - Questions medication . - Eye exam include pupil dilation . - Adaptive optic image . After dilation , participant sit still look adaptive optic instrument . They look specific place image take retina . - They may also : - More image . - Perimetry . Participants look lens press button see light . - Color vision test . - Electroretinogram . Participants get numb eye drop special contact lens . A small metal electrode put forehead . They look flash light try blink .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective protocol collect ass adaptive optic ( AO ) retinal image normal diseased eye . Study Population : Three hundred fifty ( 350 ) participant eye diseases 250 normal volunteer enrol . Design : This observational protocol enroll 350 participant various eye diseases 250 age-matched healthy volunteer five year . In general , participant undergo complete ophthalmic examination include assessment visual acuity , intraocular pressure , dilate ocular examination . Imaging perform use adaptive optic instrument provide Canon , Inc Medical College Wisconsin . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome protocol qualitative quantitative assessment AO image comparison normal diseased state .</detailed_description>
