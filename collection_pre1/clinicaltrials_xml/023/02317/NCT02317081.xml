	<detailed_description>Prospective , multicenter , open-label single arm study , conduct 3 interventional cardiology center The Netherlands . The objective ass feasibility safety Axetis Inert Stent treatment patient de novo coronary artery stenosis native vessel . In total , 35 patient enrol . All patient treat Axetis Inert Coronary Stent System . All patient undergo repeat angiography 6 month follow-up . Quantitative coronary angiography ( QCA ) assessment perform baseline ( pre- post-procedure ) 6 month follow-up . All patient undergo Optical coherence Tomography ( OCT ) investigation baseline ( post procedure ) 6 month follow-up . The primary endpoint in-stent Late Lumen Loss ( LLL ) 6 month stent implantation assess off-line QCA . Clinical follow-up occur 6 12 month post-stent implantation .</detailed_description>
