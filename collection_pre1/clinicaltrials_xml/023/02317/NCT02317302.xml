	<brief_summary>In study , 50 evaluable patient undergo one FDG-PET study chemoradiation , addition standard care pretreatment 3-month post-treatment clinical FDG-PET/CT FDG-PET/MR scan . From FDG-PET study , tumor volume , SUVmax , FDGhetero , texture map obtain . Evaluating change tumor SUVmax heterogeneity treatment aid well understanding role biological parameter inadequate response chemoradiation . Other researcher , use MRI imaging , evaluate change cervical tumor volume treatment . The investigator expect variation cervical tumor shrink change chemoradiation therefore go use multiple measure addition tumor volume evaluate cervical tumor metabolic heterogeneity . Being able predict diagnosis patient high risk persistent disease follow chemoradiation would allow future study high risk patient could specifically target aggressive therapy .</brief_summary>
