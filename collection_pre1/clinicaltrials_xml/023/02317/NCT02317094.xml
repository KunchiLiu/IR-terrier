	<brief_title>Blood-flow Restricted Exercise Inclusion Body Myositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sporadic inclusion body myositis ( sIBM ) disease characterize skeletal muscle inflammation severe muscle atrophy especially muscle thigh finger flexor . In time muscle weakness cause affect person become unable walk carry basic task every day life . Currently effective treatment exist sIBM patient , however several study indicate exercise may beneficial patient . In resent year lot research attention direct toward low-intensity training partial vascular occlusion alternative conventional high intensity strength training . Interestingly low-intensity blood-flow occlude training find least beneficial cause muscle growth conventional strength training little mechanical load joint tendon . Furthermore blood-flow occluded training seem result hyper-activation muscle stem cell play important role muscle regeneration . This make blood-flow restricted training modality interest treatment possibility sIBM patient might able restore and/or maintain skeletal muscle tissue therefore also muscle function .</detailed_description>
