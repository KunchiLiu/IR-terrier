	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective study understand factor influence patient expectation enrol early-phase RS1 ocular gene transfer clinical trial assess psychological impact patient expectation time . Study Population : Up 50 adult X-linked retinoschisis eligible screened Phase I/II ocular gene transfer clinical trial include study . We hope capture experience actively engage decision-making process may choose participate clinical trial may receive gene transfer . Design : This prospective qualitative interview study quantitative questionnaire . Participation involve three interview questionnaires one year . Interviews may take place person National Institutes Health Clinical Center ( NIH CC ) telephone focus interviewee come decision participate ( participate ) early-phase ocular gene transfer trial . Interviews transcribe verbatim , cod two independent coder , analyze thematically . Participants also ask complete questionnaire measure dispositional optimism , resilience , general mood state use instrument show valid reliable general population clinical sample .
