	<detailed_description>Freezing gait ( FOG ) particular troublesome symptom occur Parkinsonian patient .This brief , episodic absence mark reduction forward progression foot despite intention walk associate fall risk . Automatized FOG episode detection would allow systematic assessment patient state objective evaluation clinical effect treatment . Techniques propose literature identify FOG episode base frequency property inertial sensor signal . Our objective adapt extend FOG detector order include associate gait pattern change , like festination . The propose approach base single wireless inertial sensor place patient 's low limb . Based freezing detector sufficient detect FOG festination episode . Stride length cadence valuable input anticipate occurrence upcoming FOG event . The investigator develop solution base minimal number embed sensor detection algorithm future real-time application . It well know auditory rhythmic stimulation visuals mark ground would improve dramatically gait patient FOG . This sensibility cue lead team develop mobility aid device rhythmic . Our purpose develop wearable assistant would trigger appropriate cueing aid occurrence freeze episode .</detailed_description>
