	<brief_title>TRT Combination With Electrical Stimulation Standing : Effect Muscle Bone Spinal Cord Injured Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Aim : To assess effect novel tri combination Activity-Dependent Rehabilitation model approach muscle volume low limb . Secondary Aims : ) To good define mechanism contribute change muscle . Preliminary data animal study show increased expression Activin receptor IIB increase nuclear localization Smad2 Smad3 SCI adverse change reverse androgen . Additional study examine mRNA level myostatin , receptor inhibitor ( e.g. , follistatins ) determine nuclear level Smad2 Smad3 . We also measure rest energy expenditure confirm change muscle mass correspond anticipate metabolic effect . ii ) To evaluate change bone bone structure Stand Training TRT ES . Individuals SCI lose motor and/or sensory function , experience dramatic muscle bone loss . Locomotor training , activity-based intervention engage neuromuscular system level lesion stand walk enhances EMG activity show modest improvement muscle without attenuation bone density [ 172-177 ] . Dynamic stand training , important component locomotor training , provide sensory feedback related stand bilateral weight bearing , result bilateral muscle activation via central pathway spinal cord [ 161,178-181 ] . Thus , stand retrain component provide physiologically relevant multi-muscle activation central pathway , dynamic gravity oppose load legs additional task specific activation muscle [ 161,162,179 ] . Functional electrical stimulation method exercise employ SCI population demonstrate success improve muscle , less conclusive evidence effect bone albeit speculation although slow prevent bone loss may feasible SCI , reverse bone loss ( i.e . restore bone ) possible , although evidence primarily apply FES single muscle [ 151,171 ] . TRT show offer logical , efficacious , cost-effective intervention , part , counteract untoward body composition , metabolic , functional sequela relative hypogonadism chronic SCI [ 37 ] . In addition , testosterone alone show increase muscle mass , muscle strength , bone androgen-deficient men old men low testosterone level [ 182,183 ] . The model compressive load generate combination stand retrain multi muscle ES multi-directional increase muscle strength force apply hip , femur tibia bone . We anticipate model stand plus TRT increase muscle mass strength stand alone . The combination multi muscle TRT+ES stand train increase muscle strength compare either arm alone , result increase synergistic response benefit surpass threshold need significantly increase bone restoration [ 102,184,185 ] .This novel tri-combination synergistic approach TRT , ES , Stand Training hypothesize increase muscle mass strength great extent alone two intervention . Measurements muscle torque obtain demonstrate quantifiable relationship muscle strength bone mass .</detailed_description>
