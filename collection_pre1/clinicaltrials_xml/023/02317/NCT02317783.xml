	<brief_summary>The initial goal investigator interdisciplinary group imagers , oncologist , neurologist , neuro-psychologists , biostatisticians obtain proof concept pilot data eventual submission National Cancer Institute Quick-Trial Imaging Image-Guided Interventions : Exploratory Grant ( R10 ) depend result pilot study . The overall objective use [ 18F ] Flutemetamol , FDG-PET , MRI well understand CICI , effect 16 -50 % individual receive long-term adjuvant chemotherapy.2,3 To date study examine problem use multi-modality image technique well understand complex significant problem . FDG-PET MRI routinely use clinical practice evaluation cognitive dysfunction old population complain memory dysfunction . It well recognize FDG-PET assist differentiation characterization various cognitive disorder due unique pattern cerebral metabolism cause various cognitive dementia-causing disorders.4-6 FDG-PET study extensively dementia research high reliability detect Alzheimers disease ( AD ) many year diagnose reliably use clinical criteria.4 To investigator knowledge , single small study use FDG-PET bolus water activation paradigm cancer patient complain memory problems.7 To date , study use Flutemetamol PET image agent assess possibility increase amyloid plaque burden potential contribute factor cognitive deficit complaint see patient experience CICI . The novel feature project combine use Flutemetamol-PET , FDG-PET , anatomic MRI study poorly understood common problem : cognitive impairment breast cancer patient treat chemotherapy . If Flutemetamol , FDG-PET , MRI provide information pathophysiology disorder , important step well understand etiology phenomenon possibly condition result cognitive dysfunction . These image assessment make possible explore alter change cerebral structure , metabolism , amyloid deposition may responsible CICI . This may help predict individual may affect problem provide information eventual therapeutic strategy treat common cancer-associated disorder . This study use Flutemetamol FDG-PET image assess quantify amyloid plaque burden cerebral glucose metabolism , respectively , breast cancer patient suffer CICI correlate finding structural change MRI . The Flutemetamol FDG-PET scan study patient compare two GE software database ( NeuroMarQ Cortex ID ) contain scan data healthy control individual evaluate abnormality cerebral glucose metabolism amyloid plaque burden differ value expect individual age range .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female patient must 18 year old inclusion research study . There inadequate experience safety Flutemetamol child therefore radiopharmaceutical use patient age 18 . Individuals 70 year age exclude incidence amyloid positivity increase significantly even cognitive problem allow test primary hypothesis . The patient must histologically prove diagnosis Stage I IIIC Breast Cancer . The patient must complete adjuvant chemotherapy within least 6 month , 36 month prior initial study scan . The patient must experience persistent cognitive problem , define impairment memory , learning , concentration , reason , executive function , attention , visuospatial skill . Patients must agree clinical radiographic endpoint result histopathologic tissue analysis laboratory information enter research database , evidence signing informed consent form . All patient , legal guardian , must sign write informed consent HIPAA authorization accordance institutional guideline . ECOG performance status 0 2 . Patients must score great equal 1 SD normative data least 1 neuropsychological measure administer . Patients know allergic hypersensitivity reaction previously administer radiopharmaceutical . Patients significant drug allergy autoimmune disease may enrol Investigator 's discretion . Adult patient require monitored anesthesia PET scanning . Patients claustrophobic undergo MRI PET image . History neurological disease know affect cognition ( e.g. , stroke , head injury loss consciousness great 30 minute , seizure disorder , demyelinate disorder , mental retardation , primary brain tumor , brain metastasis , etc . ) Current past major psychiatric illness ( e.g. , schizophrenia , bipolar affective disorder ) Evidence stroke mass lesion CT MRI scan History alcoholism substance abuse Current use cholinesterase inhibitor , cognitive enhancer , antipsychotic , antidepressant , anticonvulsant medication Current use gabapentin venlafaxine hot flash History radiation therapy brain History significant major medical illness , AIDS Uncontrolled diabetes blood glucose great 175 mg/dl day FDGPET scan Currently pregnant Color blindness ( complete DKEFS Stroop test ) Moderate Severe Depression measure Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) Short Form . The cutoff score BDI 8/9 .</criteria>
