	<brief_title>A Study Determine Serum Skin Biopsy Biomarkers Patients Receiving Topical Corticosteroid ( TCS ) Following TCS Withdrawal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory study consist four visit investigator site post screening : Weeks 0 ( baseline ) , 2 , 6 8 ( Figure 1 ) . At first visit ( baseline ) , patient meet screen eligibility criterion start stable TCS regimen total two week . At second visit ( Week 6 ) follow two week therapy stable TCS , patient stop TCS blood , serum , plasma two 6mm punch biopsy ( one lesional ( L ) one non-lesional ( NL ) skin ) obtain . At third visit ( Week 6 ) , four week receive TCS , sample collection repeat patient enter two week safety follow . At end safety follow ( last visit , Week 8 ) obtain write informed consent patient , blood , serum plasma sample mav collect .</detailed_description>
