	<brief_summary>Background : Cardiac arrhythmia terminate electrical current apply external defibrillator . This treatment , name cardioversion , use decade treatment atrial fibrillation . Several kind defibrillator exist , though relative efficacy safety defibrillator clear . During cardioversion , oxygen administer , long-held belief oxygen always beneficial patient . This challenge recent study suggest excessive oxygenation potentially dangerous patient . Objective : 1 . To compare efficiency safety two different defibrillator 2 . To investigate effect excessive oxygen injury heart follow cardioversion . Experimental design : Patients recruit outpatient clinic Department Cardiology , Regional Hospital Randers , Denmark part pre-cardioversion check . Patients randomized cardioversion use one two defibrillator randomize treatment room air 100 % oxygen . The cardiac condition measure blood sample cardioversion , 4 hour cardioversion 3 month cardioversion . Heart rhythm measure ECG cardioversion , 1 minute- , 30 minutes- 4 hour cardioversion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Treatment cardiac arrest include effective chest compression , ventilation use high flow oxygen delivery electric shock ( cardioversion ) . Prompt termination cardiac arrhythmia sufficient airway handle include oxygenation crucial factor patient outcome . Studies suggest cardioversion may induce myocardial injury ; however currently unknown whether hyperoxia exacerbate injury . Currently , several different biphasic waveform use cardioversion.The comparative efficacy safety waveform compare clinical study . Commercially available defibrillator use different electrical waveform may affect efficacy external defibrillation . Although superiority biphasic monophasic waveform well establish , relative efficacy safety available biphasic waveform clear . The long held belief oxygen ( O2 ) always beneficial ill injure patient challenge recent study suggest excessive oxygenation may result free-radical mediate tissue damage , result increase morbidity mortality . Recent guideline suggest O2 'titrated ' achieve appropriate target saturation 94-98 % rather administer all-or-nothing fashion , particularly patient myocardial ischemia follow resuscitation cardiac arrest . The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network ( SIGN ) , British Thoracic Society , National Institute Health Care Excellence ( NICE ) , European Resuscitation Council respect body restrict O2 use hypoxemia , pulmonary oedema continue myocardial ischemia , base expert opinion pathophysiological reason rather hard evidence . Studies use patient present shockable life-threatening arrhythmia ( e.g . ventricular fibrillation ) difficult perform ethical practical reason . This study therefore use patient require elective cardioversion atrial arrhythmia , able give consent also present control population . Elective cardioversion standard treatment patient atrial arrhythmia perform day case procedure general anaesthesia . This study follow aim : 1 . To compare standard biphasic waveform newer pulse biphasic waveform little publish data 2 . To compare effect hyperoxia room air myocardial injury follow cardioversion publish data . Methods : All patient admit cardioversion atrial fibrillation flutter potentially eligible study . Patients recruit Regional Hospital Randers part pre-cardioversion check . This first contact patient , receive oral write information . The oral write information give doctor and/or primary investigator . The information give quiet setting , patient may ask question study . It possible patient companion present . Informed consent obtain participant pre-cardioversion check alternatively prior cardioversion allow patient companion present consent give . Patients decline participate study receive treatment accord standard protocol . Patients atrial fibrillation flutter ≤48 hour may cardioverted immediately . Patients atrial fibrillation flutter &gt; 48 hour require documented weekly international normalize ratio ( INR ) ≥2.0 ( include within 48 hour cardioversion ) treatment dabigatranetexilat three week longer . Alternatively , transoesophageal echocardiogram document absence intracardiac thrombus accept cardioversion perform treatment low molecular weight heparin . All patient discharge recommendation therapeutic anticoagulation accord current guideline . Patient preparation Patients consult prior cardioversion ; standard blood test take , blood pressure , height weight measure . Information patient chart ( age , gender , morbidity , co-morbidity medication ) use define baseline value . In addition New York Heart Association Functional Classification ( NYHA ) , European Heart Rhythm Association AF-related symptom ( EHRA ) , American Society Anaesthesiologists Score ( ASA ) Canadian Cardiovascular Society Grading System ( CCS ) record history taking . In addition , information patient chart regard comorbidities , medication etc . obtain . Cardioversion protocol Blood sample , ECG , blood pressure , oxygen saturation heart rate obtain baseline patient receive 0.5 mg Rapifen i.v . All patient treat 100 % oxygen room air , 10-15 L/ minute 3 minute administration Propofol . All patient treat Propofol 1 mg i.v./kg bodyweight subsequent 20 mg bolus need . Before cardioversion PaO2 measure arterial blood gas ( 1 mL ) . Follow All patient see outpatient clinic 3 month . Echocardiography perform biomarkers measure . Patients classify NYHA , EHRA , ASA CCS . Statistics Regarding waveform : Assuming cumulative efficacy , define success rate deliver shock , one waveforms 95 % , waveform ≥80 % , sample size 75 patient group need achieve power 80 % reject null hypothesis ( difference cumulative efficacy ≥15 % ) . Continuous variable ( number shock , deliver energy etc . ) express mean ± SD median value compare Students t-test equivalent non-parametric test . Categorical variable ( e.g . successful cardioversion ) express percentage compare use Chi-square Fisher 's exact test ( appropriate ) . P ≤ 0.05 consider statistically significant comparison . Regarding oxygen treatment : It estimate 150 patient sufficient study . After treatment 60 patient , interim futility test perform . Biomarker data analyze use parametric non-parametric test appropriate . P ≤ 0.05 consider statistically significant . Ethics Approval The Danish Research Ethics Committee Danish Data Protection Agency obtain . The project perform accordance Danish Health Act .</detailed_description>
