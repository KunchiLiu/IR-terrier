	<brief_summary>Background : - Fatigue common side effect cancer treatment . No medication treat fatigue . Researchers want see drug ketamine improve fatigue radiation therapy cancer . They compare effect ketamine fatigue midazolam , sedative similar effect . Objectives : - To good understand fatigue people complete radiation therapy cancer . To look effect dose ketamine fatigue . Eligibility : - Adults 18 old complete radiation therapy cancer enrol NIH protocol 08-NR-0132 . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . They complete questionnaire fatigue take breath alcohol test . - The study divide 2 phase : - During first phase I visit , participant blood take . They talk fatigue symptom . They take think handgrip strength test . Then get either ketamine placebo ( midazolam ) intravenous line , place needle guide thin plastic tube arm vein . - Participants follow-up phone call within 1 day . - Participants phase I visit 3 , 7 , 14 day infusion . For 3- 7-day visit , participant take think handgrip strength test . They complete questionnaire , talk infusion side effect , blood take . For 14-day visit , talk fatigue infusion side effect . They start phase II day . - Phase II visit phase I , except 14-day visit phone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although underlying mechanism fatigue study several disease condition ( Bower et al. , 2002 ; Brola et al. , 2007 ) , etiology , mechanism , risk factor remain elusive , symptom remain poorly manage . Fatigue conceptualize multidimensional symptom incorporate temporal , sensory , cognitive/mental , affective/emotional , behavioral , physiological dimension ( Voss , et al. , 2006 ) . We recently observe increased level neutrophic factor ( brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) ) , glial-cell line derive neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) synaptosomal-associated protein ( SNAP ) serum sample fatigue prostate cancer men receive external beam radiation therapy , suggest fatigue may component depression N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor may involve fatigue intensification cancer therapy . Ketamine NMDA receptor antagonist report treat acute depression ( Berman et al. , 2000 ; Prommer , 2012 ; Aan Het Rot et al. , 2012 ) . Depression cancer-related fatigue ( CRF ) highly correlated cancer therapy ( Portenoy Itri , 1999 ; Roscoe et al. , 2002 , Servaes et al. , 2002 , Aan Het Rot et al. , 2012 ) . This double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over study explore effect single , intravenous dose ketamine provide immediate reduction fatigue follow radiation therapy . The primary objective study determine immediate effect single intravenous dose ketamine reduce clinically-significant worsen fatigue follow radiation therapy . The secondary objective study investigate level cytokine ( i.e. , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) , insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-I ) , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-8 , transform growth factor ( TGF ) alpha beta ) , neurotrophic factor ( i.e. , BDNF , GDNF , SNAP ) , metabolic ( i.e. , apoliprotein , arginine , arginase ) , mitochondrial ( i.e. , oxygen consumption rate , glycolysis rate ) markers peripheral blood treatment ketamine placebo relate level self-reported fatigue , depression , health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) score . This study also aim measure cognitive function skeletal muscle strength patient treatment ketamine placebo relate finding self-reported fatigue , depression , HRQOL score . We enroll 40 subject complete radiation therapy cancer within least 3 month . The primary outcome measure study change self-reported fatigue score receive single intravenous dose ( 0.5 mg/kg ) ketamine placebo . The secondary outcome study include : cytokine profile ( e.g . TNFalpha , IGF-I , IL-6 , IL-8 , TGFalpha TGFbeta ) , neurotrophic factor ( e.g . BDNF , GDNF ) , metabolic ( i.e. , apoliprotein , arginine , arginase ) , mitochondrial marker ( i.e. , Complex I-V , manganese superoxide dismutase ( MnSOD ) , oxygen consumption rate , glycolysis rate ) blood sample ; cognitive function test score ; depression score ; HRQOL score ; skeletal muscle strength study participant dose ketamine placebo .</detailed_description>
