	<brief_summary>Primary objective To determine BRCA1 BRCA2 variant 250 Romanian woman breast/ovarian cancer select likeliness harbor germline mutation gene specific criterion high-risk status include age disease onset . Secondary objective Considering fact BRCA test routine procedure Romania mutation prevalence varies different population , intend look founder mutation population , run full BRCA gene sequence representative population sample . This would allow targeted approach real-life practice would ensure personalized solution every patient need .</brief_summary>
