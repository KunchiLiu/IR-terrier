	<brief_summary>Previous research position statement outlined necessity balance gait test post-concussion evaluation athlete . However , many currently available balance test technique lack objectivity sensitivity effect concussion . Such balance impairment may exist follow concussion due disruption vestibular and/or ocular motor system . However , clinically feasible tool longitudinally examine detect gait balance control deficits investigate vestibular motor dysfunction may lead gait imbalance . Additionally , participation physical cognitive activity post-concussion may affect recovery . While limited evidence exist support notion , investigation necessary improve clinical management recommendation . The propose study allow examination tool add value post-concussion clinical evaluation study-related outcome enhance understanding dynamic balance control vestibular/ocular motor recovery , potential implementation concussion management protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To address study hypothesis , investigator plan recruit subject diagnose concussion participate sport medicine physicians Boston Children 's Hospital Sports Concussion Clinic . If patient elect participate , undergo regularly schedule clinical examination along two test component require le 15 minute additional time complete : instrumented gait balance assessment , vestibular-ocular motor screen , weekly activity survey . Participants concussion match control subject meet similar demographic characteristic report clinic orthopedic injury affect brain function , gait , either low extremity . During assessment , participant complete protocol measure balance control walk simultaneously complete cognitive task , vestibular-ocular motor ability , physical cognitive activity level . As need exist develop protocol utilize inexpensive , objective , sensitive measurement track concussion recovery , study seek incorporate innovative clinically feasible method clinical examination concussion .</detailed_description>
