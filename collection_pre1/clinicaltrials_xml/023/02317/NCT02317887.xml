	<brief_summary>Background : - X-linked juvenile retinoschisis ( XLRS ) cause change RS1 gene . These change cause abnormal function eye protein retinoschisin . Without normal retinoschisin , layer retina split vision lose . Researchers want try introduce healthy RS1 gene eye cell , see help retinal cell make healthy retinoschisin . They put gene virus . The gene virus package know gene transfer vector ( AAV-RS1 vector ) . Objectives : - To see AAV-RS1 vector safe use people . Eligibility : - Adults 18 old mutation RS1 gene , 20/63 vision bad one eye , XLRS . Design : - Participants screen genetic test confirm XLRS . They medical history physical eye exam . - At visit 1-2 , participant follow : - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood urine test - Tuberculosis skin test - Eye exam - Vision test ( one test intravenous line place arm . A dye inject travel blood vessel eye ) . - At visit 3 , AAV-RS1 vector inject needle study eye . Participants pupils dilate . They get numb eye drop . - Visits 4-13 occur 18 month gene transfer . Many test repeat . Participants discuss side effect . - Visits 14-17 occur yearly year 2 5 . - After year 5 , participant contact yearly phone 15 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study RS1 Ocular Gene Transfer X-linked Retinoschisis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To evaluate safety tolerability ocular AAV-RS1 vector ( AAV8-scRS/IRBPhRS ) gene transfer retina participant affect X-linked juvenile retinoschisis ( XLRS ) . Study Population : Male participant affect XLRS receive ocular gene transfer . A maximum 24 participant may enrol . Design : This Phase I/IIa , prospective , dose escalation , single-center study . One eye participant receive AAV-RS1 gene vector application intravitreal injection . Participants closely monitored conjunction DSMC oversight . Participants follow 18 month continue follow 15 year enrollment , per FDA requirement , safety analysis . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome safety ocular AAV-RS1 vector determine assessment retinal function , ocular structure occurrence adverse event laboratory test . Secondary outcome include change visual function , electroretinogram ( ERG ) responses , visual field measurement , retinal image optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , formation anti-AAV anti-RS1 antibody . Statistics : No formal sample size calculation use Phase I/IIa dose-escalation study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant male mutation RS1 gene identify genotyping . Participant must 18 year age old . Participant must able understand sign inform consent . Participant must medically able comply study treatment , study test procedure followup visit . Participant least one eye meet study eye criterion list . Participant must agree receive live ( attenuate ) vaccine prior dose duration follow dosing . Participant must agree use effective barrier ( male female condom ) contraception dose continue one year gene transfer . If participant 's partner able become pregnant , second form effective contraception require dose continue one year gene transfer . Effective method contraception study include : hormonal contraception ( birth control pill , inject hormone vaginal ring ) , intrauterine device , barrier method ( condom diaphragm ) combine spermicide , surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy tubal ligation partner vasectomy ) . Participant agree use appropriate sun protection immunomodulatory agent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant actively receive another study medication/investigational product ( IP ) . Participant previously enrol another gene therapy trial . Participant currently take , take last three month , systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor prior enrollment/baseline 1 testing . Participant condition significantly increase risk systemic corticosteroid systemic steroidsparing immunomodulatory agent , HIV , syphilis , tuberculosis , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . Participant underlie serious illness impairs regular followup study . Participant diagnosis treatment malignancy ( exclude nonmelanoma skin cancer ) within previous five year . Participant preexist ocular tumor ( exclude nonsuspicious nevus ) . Participant know allergy fluorescein dye contraindication obtain fluorescein angiogram . Participant medication prevents safe administration study relate drug . Participant uncontrolled hypertension . ( Hypertension judge adequately control baseline medical evaluation exclusionary . ) Participant compromise renal function cyclosporine cellcept would contraindicate . Participant significant liver disease elevate liver enzymes ( great equal 2.5 time ULN ) . Participant low absolute neutrophil count ( ANC &lt; 1.3 x 10 ( 3 ) /micro liter ) . Participant use biologic immunosuppressive agent within last three month ( within last six month rituximab cyclophosphamide ) . STUDY EYE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : The participant must least one eye meeting inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion list . STUDY EYE INCLUSION CRITERIA : The study eye must bestcorrected EETDRS visual acuity letterscore less equal 63 ( i.e. , bad equal 20/63 ) . The visual acuity first baseline visit ( Baseline 1 ) use eligibility determination case change visual acuity second baseline visit ( Baseline 2 ) . Electroretinogram study eye scotopic combine response demonstrate subnormal b wave , consistent retinoschisis . STUDY EYE EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The study eye history ocular disease likely contribute significantly visual loss likely present special risk ( e.g. , optic neuropathy , advance glaucoma , uveitis , large bullous schisis cavity bullous retinal detachment preclude safe intravitreal injection ) . The study eye lens , cornea , medium opacity preclude adequate visualization test retina . The study eye undergone intraocular surgery within six month prior enrollment . The study eye receive topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor , receive topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor past three month . STUDY EYE SELECTION CRITERIA : If eye participant meet study eye eligibility criterion , choice study eye determine follow : The eye bad visual acuity select study eye . If eye visual acuity , choice study eye determine discretion investigator consultation participant .</criteria>
