	<detailed_description>Preterm delivery ( PTD ) lead cause neonatal mortality continue major public health concern , reach 12.9 % 2006 , despite intense research reverse trend . Currently , fetal fibronectin ( fFN ) screen cervical length determine ultrasound two test proven benefit identification great risk preterm delivery . However benefit test limit situation negative result avoid unnecessary intervention . The first goal study identify non-invasive predictor ( ) increase clinician 's ability identify patient present second trimester preterm labor ( PTL ) risk preterm delivery ( PTD ) ≤ 32 week gestation . Currently , maternal fetal monitoring limit , difficult `` see '' go placenta ( maternal-fetal interface ) without invasive measure placental biopsy amniocentesis . Our preliminary study term pregnancy show specific correlation intrauterine cytokine may reflect one noninvasive site another , depend upon type cytokine compartment secrete . Therefore , second goal study identify inflammatory marker non-invasive maternal compartment ( saliva , blood , urine , and/or cervical vaginal secretion ) strong association placenta/fetal membrane time preterm birth ≤ 32 week gestation . Pregnant woman , 32 week gestation , admit Winthrop University Hospital evaluation preterm labor eligible study . Women indicate preterm birth ( i.e . pre-eclampsia ) , multiple pregnancy , know major fetal abnormality ( ex . know incompatible life ) premature rupture membrane exclude study . After consent obtain , sample ( blood , urine , saliva , vaginal , cervical secretion ) obtain biomarkers identify use Bio-Plex cytokine concentration assay . These woman follow deliver . Women deliver 32 week gestation form control group woman deliver 32 week gestation form preterm birth group . Concentration biomarkers various maternal-fetal compartment analyze compare two group . For woman delivery ≤ 32 week gestation , non-invasive sample also collect around delivery cytokine level compare placenta/fetal membrane access well non-invasive fluid reflect intrauterine environment . We hypothesize preterm labor display inflammatory profile , consist unique inflammatory biomarkers different non-invasive bodily fluid compartment ( Il-10 urine , VEGF cervical secretion , IP-10 saliva ) , correlate high incidence preterm birth .</detailed_description>
