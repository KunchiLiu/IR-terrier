	<brief_summary>This first-in-human , open-label , multi-center , Phase 1 study RO6927005 . The study establish safety tolerability profile RO6927005 conduct two part . In Part A , first dose escalation carry use cohort 1 patient . Single patient cohort use investigate increase dos first dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) reach grade-2 related toxicity ( except infusion-related reaction ) , whichever come first . At least 3 patient enrol cohort thereafter , , require , expand additional patient . Part B study consist multiple ascend dose phase ( multiple patient cohorts - &gt; /= 3 patient ) follow extension phase RO6927005 give combination gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel . Preliminary clinical activity explore throughout study . Patients treat disease progression and/or lack clinical benefit , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal treatment reason , death , pregnancy termination study Sponsor , whichever come first .</brief_summary>
