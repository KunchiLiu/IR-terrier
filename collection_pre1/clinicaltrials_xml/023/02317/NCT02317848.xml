	<brief_summary>The prevalence sleep-disordered breathing common patient stable chronic heart failure ( 83 % ) . Basically , SAS divide two category : central SAS ( CSAS ) obstructive SAS ( OSAS ) . The two coexist . In patient CHF , presence SAS associate high mortality . CHF associate high rate re-hospitalization significant morbidity mortality consider major medical economic problem . To date , study investigate prevalence , severity , persistence role SAS cardiac decompensation . For different pathophysiological consideration , assume SAS exacerbate AHF . Therefore SAS conventionally screen phase . This assumption question recently study show stability type SAS severity decompensation episode stable HF . Our hypothesis SAS AHF episode CHF remain stable term severity type three month decompensation . Thus early polygraphy may reliable identify HF patient SAS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sleep apnea syndrome ( SAS ) common stable chronic heart failure ( CHF ) ( 60-83 % ) divide two main type : central SAS ( CSAS ) obstructive SAS ( OSAS ) . Several study show association SAS HF severity prognosis ( Damy T , et al . European journal heart failure 2012 , 14 ( 9 ) :1009-1019 ) . Acute heart failure ( AHF ) one major complication CHF . It assume AHF , severity apnea syndrome increase due increase capillary pressure blood volume , reason common screen SAS decompensation phase avoid overestimation . Unfortunately , screen often perform specialized center require another stay hospital . The assumption severity SAS increase AHF question recently study . These study suggest prevalence SAS type similar acute decompensated phase stabilization HF regard SAS severity type . Interestingly , study conduct Padeletti , include 10 patient underwent polysomnography control immediately discharge hospital , measure parameter remain stable overall . Padeletti M , et al . Sleep medicine 2009 , 10 ( 3 ) :353-360 ) . Khayat et al ( Khayat RN , et al . Journal cardiac failure 2009 , 15 ( 9 ) :739-746 ) demonstrate stability SAS 6 week episode decompensation . In study 395 patient AHF include mean LVEF 33 % , 75 % ( 298 ) SAS 57 % obstructive 18 % central SAS ( ref ) . 100 % patient diagnose obstructive SAS decompensation phase remain 6 week later . For central SAS 12 patient two polygraphies , 4 report change type SAS become obstructive . This raise question importance early diagnosis SAS hospitalization AHF allow rapid care management . The aim multicenter study assess prevalence , persistence SAS 3 month follow decompensation well prognostic value 1 year . If SAS stable episode AHF return stable CHF , treatment SAS may potentially consider admission phase . The benefit therapeutic management course validate clinical trial .</detailed_description>
