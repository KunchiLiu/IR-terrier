	<brief_summary>Some woman child produce enough follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) luteinising hormone ( LH ) . When happen ovary fail produce egg menstrual cycle - condition know anovulation . Anovulation treat give replacement FSH LH . Pergoveris medication contain FSH LH . It use treatment anovulation woman produce enough FSH LH . A new , liquid formulation Pergoveris test study . It compare current freeze-dried marketed formulation see new formulation get blood stream easily current formulation . This study involve 38 healthy female subject 2 treatment period last approximately 77 day . Each subject receive single dose new liquid formulation single dose current market formulation separate interval two week randomise ( chance ) order . Blood sample take regular interval 2 week dose measure level FSH LH . To participate female subject must normal ovary internal ultrasound scan , normal result cervical smear test , take combined oral contraceptive ( OC ) pill . Eligible subject usual OC pill replace another call Marvelon throughout study . After 14 day subject level FSH LH check sufficiently reduce proceed dose . Subjects receive one formulation . An ultrasound scan ovary perform 7 day later , another one 7 day later next dose . Subjects whose ovary show sign stimulation give second dose . The ultrasound scan repeat 7 day second dose .</brief_summary>
