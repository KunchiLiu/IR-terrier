	<detailed_description>Older people often use medication anticholinergic sedative side effect increase risk fall , fracture cause fall cognitive impairment . In Netherlands medication review do pharmacist collaboration general practitioner optimize medication use reduce adverse drug event . To maximize benefit medication review helpful identify patient high risk medication , yet tools identify patient need medication review . The Drug Burden Index ( DBI ) tool , design Australia , calculate burden anticholinergic sedative medication , take account patient 's dose . The DBI could useful tool identify high risk patient could benefit medication review . The objective study evaluate whether DBI use tool identify patient anticholinergic/sedative medication need medication review . A single blind clustered randomize control intervention study . Every pharmacy form cluster per pharmacy one pharmacist perform medication review . In pharmacy , one half eligible patient randomly allocate control group half intervention group . There two measurement : baseline follow-up , 3 month medication review take place . The study population include community-dwelling patient age ≥ 65 , polypharmacy ( ≥ 5 medication ) DBI value ≥ 1 ( n = 190 ) select 10 community pharmacist . The intervention consist structure 5-step multidisciplinary medication review ( STRIP method ) describe multidisciplinary guideline Dutch General Practitioners Society ( Nederlands Huisartsen Genootschap , 2013 ) include objective reduce DBI , perform pharmacist collaboration general practitioner . The main endpoint difference proportion patient decrease DBI ≥ 0.5 intervention control group follow ( 3 month later ) . Secondary outcome difference proportion patient DBI &lt; 1 intervention control group follow ( 3 month later ) , anticholinergic side effect , risk fall , cognitive function , function daily activity , hospital admission mortality . All participant inform study . Informed consent ask every participant . Data process anonymously . Only researcher access data . If require , Dutch Inspection Healthcare also grant access data Inspection .
