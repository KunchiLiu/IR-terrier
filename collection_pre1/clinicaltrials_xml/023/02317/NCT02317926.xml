	<brief_summary>The propose study design prospective , randomize , double-blind , crossover study . After informed consent obtain , patient randomize receive either desiccate thyroid capsule , L-T4/L-T3 ( ThyrolarTM ) capsule , L-T4 alone capsule . All study participant , physician investigator , administer neurocognitive test analyze test result blind throughout study . Subjects undergo memory testing , disease specific symptom questionnaire , general mental health assessment , complete physical examination , baseline EKG , biochemical test consist serum TSH , free T4 , total T4 , total T3 , free T3 , T3 resin uptake , reverse T3 , sex hormone bind globulin ( SHBG ) , serum iodine , lipid panel , insulin , glucose leptin . This test DXA scan body composition perform baseline 3 month treatment period . Deiodinase type 2 ( DIO2 ) polymorphisms analyse - also perform begin study result blind investigator perform memory testing . After 5-6 week study medication , TSH level check medication adjust maintain TSH level 0.46-4.68 mIU/L . Once TSH level desire range , subject continue medication additional 6 week . Subjects crossed-over treatment arm 3 month . Again , test perform treatment period . Finally subject switch 3rd arm testing perform treatment period . A cross-over design prefer assess subjective symptom clinical well-being parameter . Therefore , able evaluate effectiveness L-T4/T3 ( ThyrolarTM ) v DTE v T4 alone patientssubjects . This also support previous study Escobar-Morreale et al . Additionally , Wechsler memory scale , DEXA body composition , measurment reverse T3 , insulin , leptin , DIO2 polymorphisms analysis include research portion study . Further , frequency serum blood draw , research purpose , interval 0 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 36 week .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects age 18 65 levothyroxine primary hypothyroidism least 6 month Department Defense beneficiary live within 60 mile Besthesda , MD Subjects exclude follow problem : pregnancy , plan pregnancy next 12 month , cardiac disease , especially coronary artery disease , chronic obstructive lung disease , malabsorption disorder , gastrointestinal surgery , significant renal liver dysfunction , seizure disorder , thyroid nonthyroid active cancer , uncontrolled psychosis , psychotropic medication use , steroid use , amiodarone , chemotherapy cancer , iron supplement 325mg per day , carafate/ proton pump inhibitor use , cholestyramine use , recent order expect move geographic area , age le 18 year old old 65 year old . Patients scheduled deployment exclude . Subjects subclinical hypothyroidism exclude . If include patient subclinical hypothyroidism , difficult ass outcomes . This small percentage patient subclinical hypothyroidism benefit thyroid hormone therapy therefore , crossover study do project show difference therapy . Females childbearing age screen initial assessment pregnancy part standard care ( eg history amnenorrhea and/or positive pregnancy test via hCG ) . There experience use desiccate thyroid extract pregnant woman publish paper area . Desiccated thyroid extract rat CategoryA drug pregnancy mean known risk fetus .</criteria>
