	<brief_summary>A substantial portion people cover Medicare develop Alzheimer 's disease form dementia together devastate life million people United States , cost u total $ 200 billion every year . Getting brain scan PET scanner look abnormal brain metabolism pattern recognize `` reasonable necessary '' patient `` recently establish diagnosis dementia '' ( Centers Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , Decision Memo CAG-00088R ) , evidence consider less clear patient less severe cognitive problem , and/or patient get brain scan PET scanner look abnormal protein brain ( CMS Decision Memo CAG-00431N ) . This project employ scientifically rigorous design ( prospective , multi-centered , randomize controlled trial ) determine whether PET scan help distinguish accurately do current clinical practice patient early molecular change brain benefit Alzheimer related treatment patient , proven measure extent PET scan actually lead earlier appropriate therapy , fact result improve outcome Medicare beneficiaries health care system obtain care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overarch objective project test whether diagnostic assessment inform data molecular cerebral change lead improve health outcome epidemiologically major segment geriatric patient population - people experience change cognitive skill relative prior level cerebral functioning . In present proposal , specifically aim measure knowledge molecular cerebral information 1 ) influence therapeutic management patient evaluate symptom cognitive decline , 2 ) impact upon long-term health outcome , particularly patient finding positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan consistent presence Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) - like change brain . Patients suffer documentable decline cognitive function undergo baseline neuropsychologic testing , neuroimaging MRI PET . Reports PET scan seal time interpretation , randomize respect whether release patient ' manage physician time interpretation , two year time scan perform . All treatment decision make manage physician patient . Cognitive ability , functional status , clinical social history parameter assess every six month . Our central hypothesis among group patient whose PET scan result convey physicians time scanning , cognitive functional ability maintain high level two year follow PET . Beyond address specific aim note described , valuable feature project collection rich source data use address many question beyond major focus ( e.g. , diagnostic value volumetric MRI data use instead , conjunction , PET data Medicare beneficiary population ; incremental value apply statistically parameterizing and/or quantify software tool PET data ) . The protocol design conform standard specify Centers Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) Coverage Evidence Development ( CED ) , generally , requirement CED study responsive CMS Decision Memo CAG-00431N , specifically .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Cognitive decline and/or personality change present , observable physician and/or close contact ( ) patient ; absence , patient provide clear history decline patient 's physician deems reliable . 2 . If history neurologic exam reveals find suspicious stroke , tumor , bleed , ictal activity , hydrocephalus , CT/MRI appropriate neurological neurosurgical consultation must obtain . 3 . Standard history , physical , laboratory screen perform identify possible presence depression , substance abuse , malnourishment , medication effect interaction , cardiopulmonary compromise , electrolyte/calcium imbalance , anemia , hypoxemia , infection , thyroid dysfunction , renal dysfunction , hepatic dysfunction , glucose dysregulation . 4 . Any positive finding reveal 2 ) 3 ) appropriately treat , wherever possible , cognitive/behavioral deficit persist posttherapy . 1 . Subjects age 65 recruit , order enhance relevance project focus group Medicare beneficiaries serious concern early sign symptom senile onset dementia typically emerge . 2 . Cognitive dysfunction impair subject 's ability perform activity daily live . 3 . Present past history thyroid disease . 4 . Claustrophobia metal body condition would preclude PET MRI acquire . 5 . Visual , auditory motor deficit would preclude accurate neuropsychological testing . 6 . ADspecific pharmacotherapy already initiate .</criteria>
