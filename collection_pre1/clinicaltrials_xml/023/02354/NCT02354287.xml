	<brief_summary>There consensus method removal diminutive ( 5mm ) small ( 6-9mm ) colorectal polyps colonoscopy . Neither European Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline removal polyp , despite fact around 90 % lesion remove polypectomy colonoscopy diminutive small . Multiple technique use polyp removal , especially diminutive lesion . These include either forceps , hot cold , well snare electrocautery cold snare . Forceps utilise shear force grasp tissue remove , hot method pass current grasper essentially burn tissue . Snare use small metal loop place tightened base polyp cut tissue either straight away cold method electrocautery small current pass loop assist cut tissue . Surveys Colonoscopists Gastroenterologists Australia United States show choice method use diminutive small polyp highly variable cold snare marginally favoured.Studies polypectomy technique limit clear additional data review polypectomy method need undertaken order determine optimal method removal diminutive small colorectal polyp . A technique use Gloucestershire National Health Service ( NHS ) trust involve submucosal pre injection standard solution use cold forceps removal polyp ≤7mm . This appear safe highly effective method removal lesion compare technique . No formal publish study complete evaluate method national international level . We propose study evaluate effectiveness , safety cost method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Cold Biopsy Forceps With Pre-lift Complete Resection Colonic Polyps ≤7mm Size</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis A pre injection cold forceps technique removal polyp ≤ 7mm safe result retrieval rate &gt; 98 % complete histological resection &gt; 90 % time . Objectives 1 . Determine histological complete resection rate ( CRR ) use pre injection lift cold forceps polypectomy polyps ≤7mm . 2 . Determine number bite require complete visual resection polyp time take begin pre injection needle insertion till complete resection . 3 . To determine polyp retrieval rate method . 4 . To record complication technique . 5 . To compare CRR , number biopsy visual eradication , time take , polyp retrieval rate complication rate method cold forceps alone cold snare previous study . Methods Participants : Sample size 150 polyp , anticipate capture 75 100 patient base average 2 polyps per patient . There publish data polypectomy technique limit data diminutive small polypectomy technique . Other comparative publish study look polypectomy technique diminutive small polyp polyp number fifty four one hundred seventeen.The sample size 150 polyp approximation base fact achievable figure within scope project local clinical service yield relatively narrow confidence interval . Colonoscopists 3 experienced Gastroenterologists ( JA , TB , PD ) work within Gloucestershire NHS Trust , perform 3000 colonoscopy . All Gastroenterologists certify British Bowel Cancer Screening Program Colonoscopists . As technique study already well practice within trust extra time require polyp include study negligible . Pathologist All Polypectomy specimens EMR tissue examine expert Gastrointestinal Pathologist ( NS ) blind patient colonoscopist detail examine specimen . The additional work pathology department negligible . It routine practice take additional material analysis incomplete removal polyp suspect . In study polyp review . NS provide consistency also time support u project . Course Action : 1 . Patients consent participate study prior procedure . Information regard study post patient least week prior colonoscopy . 2 . If patient agrees participate detail include age , sex indication scope record . This data record patient study number . The patient otherwise anonymised . 3 . Data colonoscopy polypectomy record , include polyp size , location , time resection , bite require complete visual resection ( another study show median number bite 2 range 1-5 ) , overall withdrawal time quality bowel preparation time procedure . Any adverse event time colonoscopy , polypectomy EMR subsequent patient follow 7 day post procedure record prospectively form A ( Appendix 1 ) also report Research Development team within 7 day Investigators become aware adverse event . 3 . All colonoscopy perform use Olympus 240 260 colonoscope magnetic endoscopic image Narrow band imaging ( NBI ) available Colonoscopist require . 5 . The equipment use polypectomy Endomucosal resection ( EMR ) polypectomy site include follow . 1 . Needle pre injection 2 . Pre injection mix include 19 ml gelofusine , 1ml 1:10000 adrenaline 1ml indigo carmine . 3 . Cold forceps span 6.8mm capacity 7.22mm3 4 . Olympus snare master 10mm snare . 6 . Any complication relate polypectomy record . 7 . Polyps ≤7mm include study deem appropriate colonoscopist . Polyps may consider inappropriate polyp location appearance suitable technique study . 8 . These polyp resect cold forceps pre injection submucosa . Data related resection record note . 9 . The polypectomy site resect EMR use conventional snare method ascertain residual polyp tissue . This additional step polypectomy process would otherwise take place . The risk step adverse event patient would significantly less risk complication therapeutic Colonoscopy 0.05 0.07 % . A maximum 3 polyp per patient include study analysis order ensure patient colonoscopist time procedure differ significantly would normally . 10 . Both EMR specimen resect polyp tissue send histopathological evaluation single expert Gastrointestinal Histopathologist kindly agree review extra EMR tissue time . 11 . Recruited patient call one-week post colonoscopy ensure wish withdraw study concern post procedure . Adverse Events As mention risk adverse event related polypectomy technique study EMR residual tissue minimal . All adverse event ( medical occurrence ) record data collection spreadsheet . Any event classify 'serious adverse event ' ( SAE ) report Research Development Unit ( RSDU ) . The following criterion use ass relationship ( causality ) adverse event polypectomy technique EMR perform 1 . None : - The adverse event definitely associate investigational technique use . 2 . Possible : - A causal relationship possible adverse event follow reasonable temporal sequence application intervention , could produce patient 's clinical state mode treatment administer patient . 3 . Probable : - The causal relationship probable adverse event follow reasonable temporal sequence application investigational technique . This likely adverse event explain know characteristic patient 's clinical state Adverse event assess one investigator qualify Gastroenterologists manage accordingly . The severity adverse event record use follow criterion : 1 . Mild : - Symptom ( ) barely noticeable patient make patient uncomfortable . The AE influence performance functioning . Prescription drug ordinarily need relief symptom ( ) . 2 . Moderate : - Symptom ( ) sufficient severity make patient uncomfortable require endoscopic intervention treatment . 3 . Severe : - Symptom ( ) sufficient severity cause patient severe discomfort require subsequent treatment require major endoscopic intervention , hospitalisation surgery . A serious adverse event ( SAE ) include adverse event result death , require either inpatient hospitalization prolongation hospitalization , life threatening , result persistent significant disability/incapacity . Other important medical event , base upon appropriate medical judgement , may consider Serious Adverse Events trial participant 's health risk intervention require prevent adverse outcome . Dr Alex di Mambro FRCP ( Gloucestershire NHS Trust Gastroenterologist ) evaluate , report assist patient management SAE . In way involve study development involve course study . All report serious adverse event ( SAE ) record SAE form trial forward immediately Research &amp; Development Unit ( RSDU ) . A copy form see appendix 1 . In event SAE persisting great 24 hour another form submit RSDU . Also , case persist SAE time event resolution , patient death discharge subsequent form complete submit . Data record statistical analysis : All data record prospectively Microsoft excel spread sheet chief investigator ( SO ) statistical analysis complete SPSS version 16 . Based target sample size 150 polyp 90 % success rate calculate 95 % confidence interval 84.5-94.2 % . Data storage : The collect data keep secure within department Gastroenterology share uninvolved person . The data anonymised excel sheet data collect password protect available individual involve study . All record data destroyed end calendar year 2017 anonymised result present publish expected end calendar year 2015 . Results It anticipated result study complete abstract submission United European Gastroenterology Week May 2015 . This meeting hold Europe October 2015 . We aim publish data international Endoscopic journal late 2015 . Results make available Bowel Cancer screen nurse able disseminate result various Bowel Cancer support group . Funding Researchers Time allocation The chief investigator time ( 20hr/week ) allocate current Gloucestershire NHS Trust contract education development . Development study , data recording/entry generation academic paper undertaken time . Professor Neil Shepherd , Pathologist project agree undertake additional work EMR tissue review time . Additional time colonoscopists EMR polypectomy site consider negligible course standard colonoscopy . Equipment As explain method section minimal additional piece equipment need compare standard colonoscopy . Snares EMR polypectomy site additional snare already require removal large polyps course colonoscopy . Olympus kindly provide additional snare study . All equipment pre injection solution , pre injection needle cold forceps would normally used course colonoscopy polypectomy .</detailed_description>
