	<brief_title>Autologous Immunoregulatory Dendritic Cells Type 1 Diabetes Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , placebo-controlled cross study design evaluate safety efficacy autologous immunoregulatory dendritic cell ( iDC ) patient type 1 diabetes . To , total 24 subject recent onset ( &lt; 100 day diagnosis ) type 1 diabetes circulate dendritic cell harvest via leukapheresis . The harvested dendritic cell incubate vitro antisense DNA oligonucleotides target primary transcript cluster differentiation antigen 40 ( CD40 ) , cluster differentiation antigen 80 ( CD80 ) cluster differentiation antigen 86 ( CD86 ) . These engineer dendritic cell give autologous intradermal injection ( 4 injection administer 2 week interval ) subject ' peri-umbilical region . The hypothesis inject cell generate immunoregulatory cell suppress autoimmune process responsible development type 1 diabetes via destruction subject 's pancreatic beta cell . Employing cross-over design , subject undergo leukapheresis outset . Twelve subject randomly assign receive cell injection outset 12 subject receive sham injection serve control . At end 12 month , subject cross-over alternative treatment continue follow additional 12 month . ( Note : The subject assign receive cell therapy segment receive injection autologous cell harvest engineered time leukapheresis perform study entry . The engineered cell store frozen need administration . This design test whether treatment later ( &gt; 1 year diagnosis ) effective immediate treatment ( &lt; 100 day diagnosis type 1 diabetes ) . As added safety measure , first 6 subject randomize age 18 . When last 6 subject complete 3 month observation follow initiation therapy , age enrollment lower age 16 next 6 subject unless safety observation dictate otherwise . When subject cohort enrol , age enrollment lower age 14 unless advise otherwise independent Data Safety Monitoring Board . When subject cohort complete observation 3 month , age enrollment lower age 12 follow clearance Data Safety Monitoring Board . If therapy successful , subject ' remain beta cell mass preserve hopefully expand autoimmune process slow stop . This outcome assess indirectly use plasma c-peptide concentration follow ingestion standardize mixed meal end 12 24 month therapy . If treatment successful , glucose control improve detectable via measurement hemoglobin A1c ( measure long-term control ) , fast plasma glucose concentration plasma glucose concentration follow ingestion standardize mixed meal . In addition , total daily insulin requirement decrease . These measure glucose control assess baseline 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 24 month . Immune marker also profile 3 month interval assess potential tolerogenic effect therapy . To end , number potentially tolerogenic/regulatory T-cells , B-cells dendritic cell circulate peripheral blood monocyte population assess . In addition , analysis select population T-cells , B-cells dendritic cell conduct entire study period attempt identify molecular signature correlate clinical response . Finally , addition routine safety laboratory measurement , report adverse event examine detail characterize safety aspects therapy . The review safety data guide independent Data Safety Monitoring Board meet least semi-annually review accrue data .</detailed_description>
