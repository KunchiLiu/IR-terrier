	<brief_summary>To determine whether pharmacological stimulation supraclavicular Brown Adipose Tissue ( BAT `` Brown Fat '' ) subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue ( WAT ) use FDA-approved beta3 agonist effective increase oxidative metabolism BAT WAT exposure cold , investigator assess efficacy FDA approve beta3 agonist Mirabegron ( trade name Myrbetriq , Astellas Pharma , Inc. ) increase oxidative metabolism supraclavicular BAT subcutaneous WAT lean obese young adult . The investigator anticipate method stimulate supraclavicular BAT subcutaneous WAT result similar 18F-labeled fluoro-deoxyglucose ( FDG ) tracer uptake positron emission tomography ( PET ) image well oxidative metabolism . This would demonstrate pharmacological stimulation BAT effective could lead , detailed clinical trial obese subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity diabetes increase epidemic proportion US many country . In addition , comorbidities metabolic disease , cardiovascular disease , cancer , osteoarthritis place huge burden health health care system United States . Finding new avenue human therapeutic thus critical challenge . Brown adipose tissue ( BAT `` Brown Fat '' ) function dissipate stored chemical energy form heat serf defend mammal hypothermia obesity . It firmly establish human functional BAT activate mild cold stress image 18F-labeled fluoro-deoxyglucose ( FDG ) PET image . Moreover , understand two distinct type brown fat cell : `` classical '' brown fat ( common supraclavicular fat depot ) form developmentally muscle-like myf5-positive lineage brown fat cell appear white adipose tissue ( WAT ) depots upon prolonged exposure cold beta-adrenergic signaling . These latter cell originate myf5-negative lineage refer beige cell . Recent data suggest adult human might brown beige fat cell inactive could activate via adrenergic system . Once activate , thermogenesis cell could affect body 's energy balance might instrumental weight management . Although adrenergic activation use cold exposure show highly effective activate brown beige fat cell , difficult implement daily routine need , practical , intervention . Mirabegron ( trade name Myrbetriq , Astellas Pharma , Inc. ) drug treatment overactive bladder FDA approve July 2012 . Mirabegron activate beta3 adrenergic receptor detrusor muscle bladder , lead muscle relaxation increase bladder capacity . There report increase BAT FDG uptake follow MIrabegron administration rodent recently human . Because pharmacological stimulation brown/beige fat cell might increase daily energy expenditure , might represent novel mechanism weight management eventually new avenue treatment obesity .</detailed_description>
