	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 , open-label , parallel group , two-part , single-dose adaptive study adult moderate mild ( need ) hepatic impairment match , healthy control subject normal hepatic function . In Part 1 , healthy control subject ( n=8 ) match subject moderate ( n=8 ) hepatic impairment enrol . If geometric mean total plasma area concentration-time curve time zero ( pre-dose ) extrapolate infinite time ( AUC [ 0-infinity ] ) GSK1265744 increase &gt; 2-fold moderately impaired subject relative match control , Part 2 conduct evaluate GSK1265744 PK subject mild hepatic impairment ( n=8 ) match , control subject ( n=8 ) . All subject receive single 30 milligram ( mg ) oral dose GSK1265744 . The primary objective study compare plasma PK parameter GSK1265744 subject hepatic impairment healthy control match gender , age , body mass index ( BMI ) .</brief_summary>
