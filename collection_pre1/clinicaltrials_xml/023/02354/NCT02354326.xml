	<brief_title>Dual Energy Computed Tomography ( CT ) Finding Bone Metastases Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare accuracy single energy CT ( SECT ) virtual non-calcium ( VNC ) double energy CT ( DECT ) standard SECT alone detection metastatic bone lesion use positron emission tomography ( PET ) -CT reference standard . OUTLINE : Computed tomography ( CT ) scan routinely use evaluation oncologic patient initial diagnosis subsequent disease stag . Detection bone metastasis standard CT , however , limited sensitivity , particularly case osteolytic intramedullary lesion . Recent study show ability detect bone marrow edema use CT use virtual non-calcium ( VNC ) dual energy CT ( DECT ) technique . Because bone marrow edema similar composition intramedullary bone metastasis ( i.e . soft tissue composition oppose calcium fat ) , VNC DECT may also helpful detection bone marrow metastasis . Cancer patient obtain Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) CT separate diagnostic CT scan part routine clinical care enrol study . The diagnostic CT scan perform DECT scanner image reconstruct SECT image routine clinical interpretation well VNC DECT image . The SECT image alone evaluate score , VNC DECT image add SECT image second evaluation ( consecutive reading session ) . Multiple reader blind PET-CT finding detection bony metastatic disease participate . Researchers hypothesize addition VNC DECT SECT accurate detection metastatic bone marrow lesion compare SECT alone .</detailed_description>
