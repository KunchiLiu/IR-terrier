	<brief_summary>An observational , point-prevalence cohort study nutrition therapy critically ill child PICUs across world . Baseline information collect include PICU hospital demographic characteristic ( e.g . age , diagnostic category , PRISM score , weight , height ) critically ill child require mechanical ventilation PICU . Nutrition practice route nutrition , kilocalorie protein level prescribe receive , interruption , etc. , collect daily basis PICU admission onwards , maximum 10 day . Data clinical outcome ( e.g . duration mechanical ventilation , PICU stay , hospital stay , acquire infection ) collect 60 day admission PICU . The main objective study examine association energy protein intake adequacy ( relation prescribe goal nutrient ) 60-day mortality mechanically ventilated child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nutrition Support prevent complication associate malnutrition use appropriately positive influence clinically important outcome , length stay , morbidity mortality . Making decision regard effective safe nutrition support challenging , consequently considerable variation exist nutrition support practice PICUs . This multicenter prospective cohort study nutritional practice mechanically ventilate child representative sample medium large ( least 8 ICU bed ) PICUs North America participate center across country . The investigator invite center 9 US Census region , least 3 Canadian Provinces PICUs 8 bed across world . Participating site recruit PALISI network ( 66 PICUs ) , disseminate study information national nutrition ( e.g . ASPEN ) critical care society ( e.g . ( SCCM ) , e-mailing individual healthcare provider . Patient selection criterion : All child ( age 1month 18 year ) admit PICU , require mechanical ventilatory support anticipate duration stay longer 48 hour eligible data collection . Data collection eligible patient continue total 10 day discharge PICU ( earlier ) minimum 15 patient ( maximum 40 patient ) accrue per site . The investigator anticipate recruitment 500 patient . The trained dietitian ( designate research nurse ) participate center use validated web-based remote data capture tool record detail nutritional intake . An instruction package describe data collection method detail provide . Following training period , begin 'going live ' date , dietitian designate coordinator participate center simultaneously enter relevant data online use secure website . Nutritional variable include energy protein goal prescribe local nutrition team , actual daily macronutrient delivery achieve , route delivery , frequency duration feed interruption , use adjunctive drug , record . Prescribed protein goal subject compare recommend daily protein 2005 DRI 2009 A.S.P.E.N . age-based guideline . The end point nutritional data collection 10 day discharge PICU , whichever sooner . The energy protein intake adequacy calculate percentage prescribe goal actually deliver average adequacy PICU stay 10 day derive . The primary outcome study 60-day patient mortality .</detailed_description>
