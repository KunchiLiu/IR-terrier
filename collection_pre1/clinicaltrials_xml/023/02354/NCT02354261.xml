	<brief_title>Open-label Trial SUBA™-Itraconazole ( SUBA-Cap ) Subjects With Basal Cell Carcinoma Nevus Syndrome ( BCCNS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single arm , phase IIb , multi-center , open-label study evaluate use oral SUBA-Cap subject Basal Cell Carcinoma Nevus Syndrome non-metastatic Basal Cell Carcinoma . Following informed consent , subject undergo skin biopsy Gli1 analysis assessment extent disease use tumor measurement ( use modify Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors criterion ) color photograph skin . Subjects receive daily oral SUBA-Cap , start dose 150 mg twice daily ( BID ) . Reassessments disease conduct week 4 , 8 , 16 , every 8 week thereafter . Subjects evidence response ( partial complete ) re-evaluated least 4 week later confirmation . Subjects may continue receive SUBA-Cap disease progression ( define appearance one new lesion ulceration target lesion ) require change therapy ( surgical intervention use systemic therapy ) appearance unacceptable side effect . Pharmacokinetic assessment ( serial trough level ) perform defined interval , possible , prior follow dose adjustment . Skin biopsies take Gli1 expression define interval .</detailed_description>
