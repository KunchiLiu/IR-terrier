	<brief_title>The Safety ahSC Chronic SCI With Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For human chronic SCI , hypothesize axon might show improved function myelin repair induced implantation ahSC . In addition spinal cord cavitation may reduce , neural sprout plasticity may enhance via neurotrophic effect . In trial , subject receive fitness conditioning rehabilitation prior transplantation order validate stability neurological baseline enhance ability undergo surgery complication . They also receive fitness conditioning rehabilitation post-transplantation maintain health promote neuronal activity potential neuroplasticity . Trial enrollment target 2 cohort . The first cohort thoracic ( T ) level 2-12 ASIA Impairment Scale ( AIS ) grade A , B , C ( n = 4 ) , second cohort cervical ( C ) level 5 T1 AIS A , B , C ( n = 6 ) . Two ( 2 ) participant AIS grade A enrolled prior enrol participant AIS B C , applicable cohort . Participants monitor throughout 6 month post-transplantation evaluation period occurrence AEs ( acute , delay , and/or cumulative ) , well change clinical status neurological status . Safety efficacy assessment perform week 1 2 post-transplantation month 2 6 post-transplantation .</detailed_description>
