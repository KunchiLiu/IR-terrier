	<detailed_description>Client motivation relate therapeutic change ( Ryan , Lynch , Vansteenkiste , &amp; Deci ) low motivation pervasive issue client BPD ( e.g. , Skodal et al. , 1983 ) . DBT ( Linehan , 1993 ) effective treatment BPD develop part address client motivation . Within DBT commitment strategy use help client establish clear goal increase motivation work . These strategy design help people commit eliminate self-harm well behaviour . People motivate work effectively towards goal autonomously motivate ( Deci &amp; Ryan , 2000 ) . Despite importance DBT , commitment strategy never study . This study examine whether commitment strategy associate increase autonomous motivation decrease self harm behaviour . This research address two primary question : 1 ) Are commitment strategy associate increase autonomous motivation decrease self-harm behaviour ? ; 2 ) Does autonomous motivation mediate relationship commitment strategy change self-harm behaviour ? The investigator also address secondary question relate predictor autonomous motivation . Our hypothesis follow : 1 ) The group receive psychoeducation enhance commitment strategy higher level autonomous motivation compare psychoeducation control group ; 2 ) autonomous motivation mediate relationship commitment strategy decrease self harm behaviour . Additionally , autonomy support , low therapist judgment , goal concordance client therapist independently contribute predict client autonomous motivation . Research area need light challenge present low motivation often characterize individual borderline trait engage self-harm behaviour . No study date examine DBT 's commitment strategy , thus , effect treatment strategy unknown need establish . Additionally , identify specific variable associate motivation eliminate self-harm help inform refinement treatment strategy . Finally , study examine role autonomous motivation treatment outcome .</detailed_description>
