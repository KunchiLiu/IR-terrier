	<brief_summary>Cervical dilator frequently use preparation prior second trimester surgical abortion . While use decrease complication associate surgical abortion , placement often uncomfortable patient . Currently prove method reduce pain osmotic dilator placement . The use numbing medication around cervix ( paracervical block ) may decrease placement pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paracervical Block Pain Control With Osmotic Dilator Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate 1.21 million abortion performed 2008 . Of , approximately 11 % occur second trimester 1.4 % occur 21 week gestation . In United States , dilation evacuation ( D &amp; E ) common method terminate second trimester pregnancy great 98 % second trimester abortion occur D &amp; E . Pre-procedure cervical preparation decrease incidence complication associate D &amp; E . Cervical dilator often use prior second trimester D &amp; Es aid soften dilate cervix . Typically , dilator placement occur day D &amp; E 1-2 day prior oftentimes occur outpatient clinic set without anesthesia readily available . Many woman experience moderate severe discomfort osmotic dilator insertion . Providers use various method minimize discomfort include PCB , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication ( NSAIDs ) , anxiolytic narcotic . In particular , PCB NSAIDs readily available clinic setting use purpose . There , however , data support efficacy ameliorate pain dilator insertion . Paracervical block use commonly decrease pain abortion procedures gynecological procedure . The PCB think work primarily block pain conduction via Frankenhauser 's plexus . As , effect may important relieve pain associated cervical dilation . In recent randomize control trial , PCB prior first trim surgical abortion find significantly reduce pain cervical dilation uterine aspiration . Since osmotic dilator placement primarily involve cervical manipulation dilation , PCB may provide pain relief placebo . The research team propose randomize controlled trial evaluate efficacy PCB decrease pain associate osmotic dilator placement . This trial also provide information degree pain woman experience osmotic dilator placement ; information previously know .</detailed_description>
