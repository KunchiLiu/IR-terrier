	<detailed_description>Flow diverters develop treat intracranial aneurysm . Embolisms occur small percentage patient result long term complication include stroke , hemorrhage , even death . The formation microemboli insertion device evaluate . During insertion , significant disruption blood flow may source intracranial microemboli . This study use transcranial doppler ultrasound ( TCD ) evaluate blood flow placement flow diverters try determine embolic event occur .</detailed_description>
