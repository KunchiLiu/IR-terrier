	<brief_summary>Phase Ib study 90 healthy adults,18 year 65 year age , evaluate safety , tolerability immunogenicity VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP ( cAd3-EBO ) VRC-EBOADC076-00-VP ( cAd3-EBOZ ) investigational Ebola vaccine Part 1 boost VRC-EBOMVA079-00-VP ( MVA-EbolaZ ) investigational Ebola vaccine Part 2 . Part 1 : Randomizations cAd3-EBO cAd3-EBOZ two different dose level within Group 1 include least 60 volunteer never receive investigational Ebola vaccine . Randomizations cAd3-EBO two different dose level within Group 2 may include 30 eligible participant previously participate RV 247 vaccine clinical trial receive investigational VRC-EBODNA023-00-VP ( Ebola DNA WT ) vaccine . Part 2 : Participants Part 1 may receive booster vaccination MVA-EbolaZ vaccine dose level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase 1b , open-label study examine safety , tolerability immunogenicity investigational Ebola vaccine conduct two Parts . In Part 1 subject randomize receive either cAd3-EBO cAd3-EBOZ vaccine two different dose level . In Part 2 , participant Part 1 may receive booster injection MVA-EbolaZ vaccine ; dose level . The hypothesis study vaccine , cAd3-EBO , cAd3-EBOZ MVA-EbolaZ , safe elicit immune response Ebola glycoprotein ( GP ) . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability study vaccine administer intramuscular ( IM ) injection . The secondary objective related immunogenicity . Study Products Description : VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP ( cAd3-EBO ) compose two recombinant cAd3 vector 1:1 ratio express Ebola WT GPs Zaire Sudan strain . It formulate 2x10 ( 11 ) particle unit ( PU ) /mL . VRC-EBOADC076-00-VP ( cAd3-EBOZ ) compose cAd3 vector express Ebola WT GP Zaire strain . It formulate 1x10 ( 11 ) PU/mL . VRC-DILADC065-00-VP ( diluent ) vaccine formulation buffer use need prepare correct dosage cAd3-EBO cAd3-EBOZ . VRC-EBOMVA079-00-VP ( MVA-EbolaZ ) compose MVA vector express Ebola WT GP Zaire strain . It formulate 3.2x10 ( 8 ) PFU/mL . Part 1 Study Plan : Group 1 : 60 volunteer randomize : 15 two dosage group VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP [ 2x10 ( 10 ) PU 2x10 ( 11 ) PU ] 15 two dosage group VRC-EBOADC076-00-VP [ 1x10 ( 10 ) PU 1x10 ( 11 ) PU ] . Group 2 : 30 volunteer previously participate RV 247 clinical trial receive investigational product VRC-EBODNA023-00-VP randomize receive one two dosage group VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP . The two group enrol simultaneously . If less 30 participant enroll Group 2 , additional participant may enrol Group 1 total 90 participant overall . Participants evaluate 9 clinic visit 48 week . Part 2 Study Plan : Part 1 participant receive study vaccination complete least 36 week follow-up , eligible consent may receive booster injection VRC-EBOMVA079-00-VP vaccine 1x10 ( 8 ) particle form unit ( PFU ) . Participants evaluate 11 clinic visit 48 week begin Part 2 .</detailed_description>
