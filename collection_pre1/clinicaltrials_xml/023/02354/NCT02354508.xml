	<detailed_description>This phase IIIb multicenter , open-label ; single arm study evaluate efficacy safety pasireotide LAR 40 mg 60 mg patient inadequately control acromegaly maximal dos first generation somatostatin analogue . The study enroll inadequately control patient high dos first-generation somatostatin analogue give least 3 month . Patients categorize two group . Group 1 consist patient treat octreotide LAR 30 mg country octreotide LAR 40mg approve treatment acromegaly time screen . These patient start 3-months run-in phase receive 40mg octreotide consider eligible enter core treatment phase . After 3 month treatment complete , prior fourth injection mean GH IGF-1 assess . Patients achieve biochemical control consider screen failure qualify core phase study . They continue treatment octreotide LAR 40 mg outside frame study . Group 2 consist patient treat octreotide LAR 30 mg country octreotide 40mg NOT yet approve time screen . This group also include patient already treat octreotide LAR 40 mg lanreotide ATG 120 mg . Patients treat first generation SSAs least 3 month prior screen . Eligible patient directly enter core treatment phase study . A run-in phase require patient population . In core treatment phase patient start treatment pasireotide LAR 40 mg every 4 week . At week 12 , mean GH value IGF-1value assess . Patients achieve biochemical control week 12 tolerability issue pasireotide LAR 40 mg dose increase 60 mg . Patients achieve biochemical control week 12 maintain dose pasireotide LAR 40 mg. A mean GH value IGF-1 value assess every 12 week Visit 777 . At week 16 28 , investigator able adjust dose base achievement biochemical control drug tolerability . If tolerability issue occur , dose decrease 20 mg. Once tolerability issue resolve , patient return dose previously receive . Patients treat total 36 week core phase . During period concomitant medication treatment acromegaly prohibit . Patients require complete core phase completion visit 4 week last dose pasireotide LAR administer . Patients discontinue core phase also require complete core phase completion visit 4 week receive last pasireotide LAR dose . Patients complete visit core phase complete assessment core phase completion visit ( Visit 777 ) move extension phase . The core phase completion visit perform Visit 777 , also first visit ( Visit 18 ) extension phase . At Visit 18 , patient receive dose pasireotide LAR receive week 32 ( Visit 17 ) . At week 40 ( Visit 19 ) , investigator decide treatment regimen pasireotide LAR dose base achievement biochemical control Visit 777 . Patients achieve biochemical control end core phase continue pasireotide LAR monotherapy dose core phase . Patients uncontrolled end core phase continue pasireotide LAR 60 mg allow receive concomitant treatment medication use treat acromegaly base investigator 's clinical judgment . GH IGF-1 level assess every 12 week week 72 . At week 52 64 , investigator able adjust dose pasireotide LAR regimen concomitant medication use acromegaly base patient achievement biochemical control drug tolerability . Patients treat total 32 week extension phase receive last dose study treatment week 68 ( Visit 26 ) . Patients require complete extension phase completion visit ( Visit 778 ) 4 week last dose pasireotide LAR administer . Patients prematurely discontinue extension phase also require complete extension phase completion visit ( Visit 778 ) 4 week receive last dose pasireotide LAR . After discontinuation study completion study treatment either core phase extension phase study , patient follow safety 12 week ( 84 day ) last study drug administration . This visit perform phone , study visit follow-up mandatory .</detailed_description>
