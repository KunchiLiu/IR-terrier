	<brief_summary>Patients often seek advice treat doctor able drive foot orthosis first metatarsal osteotomy symptomatic hallux valgus and/or additional forefoot surgery . This challenge question obvious importance patient road user . Previous study already issue drive ability different orthopedic procedure knee ankle device brake reaction time miss address foot orthoses hallux valgus forefoot surgery . This miss evidence make u evaluate influence wear foot orthosis first metatarsal osteotomy forefoot surgery drive ability ( brake response time ; BRT ) . The overall time frame nine week ; appointment BRT measurement take fifteen twenty minute . The first BRT measurement one day foot surgery without foot orthosis ( normal shoe ) orthoses ( control run ) ( 1 ) two day ( 2 ) , two week ( 3 ) , four week ( 4 ) six week ( 5 ) operation HVS FRS eight week postoperative without foot orthoses ( 6 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Foot Orthoses Braking Response Time</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study asses drive ability ( brake response time ) influence two type different foot orthoses foot surgery . Therefore two group : 1 . Hallux valgus surgery ( Chevron , Austin , SCARF , Akin etc . ) 2 . Hallux valgus additional forefoot surgery ( Chevron , Austin , SCARF , Akin etc . WEIL - Osteotomy , Peg-in-Hole , etc . ) BRT ( brake response time ) assess commonly use right-sided hallux valgus shoe ( HVS ) forefoot relief shoe ( FRS ) . We measure BRT six different time point : one day surgery without foot orthosis ( normal shoe ) orthoses ( control run ) ( 1 ) two day ( 2 ) , two week ( 3 ) , four week ( 4 ) six week ( 5 ) operation HVS FRS eight week postoperative without foot orthoses ( 6 ) . The overall time frame nine week ; appointment BRT measurement take fifteen twenty minute . The BRT assess use custom-made driving simulator use previously publish study . Participants instruct apply brake pedal exclusively right foot quickly possible visual stimulus . The time interval subject operate brake measure 20 time , average take BRT value .</detailed_description>
