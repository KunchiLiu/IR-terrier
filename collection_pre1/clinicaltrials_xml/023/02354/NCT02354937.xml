	<brief_summary>GSK1265744 ( 744 ) integrase strand transfer inhibitor ( INSTI ) currently development treatment prevention human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . Renal elimination unchanged 744 extremely low , parent 744 detected urine single 30 mg radiolabeled dose . Despite minimal contribution renal clearance overall 744 elimination , renal impairment may potentially inhibit pathway hepatic gut drug metabolism transport , result may impact 744 pharmacokinetics . The current Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) draft guidance renal impairment study suggest pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study patient renal impairment conduct even drug primarily metabolize secrete bile . The study comprise two cohort ( severe renal impairment normal renal function ) 8 subject . Upon enrolment , subject admit study center undergo serial PK sample follow single dose oral 744 30 milligram ( mg ) . Subjects return clinic follow-up evaluation 10-14 day 744 30 mg dose .</brief_summary>

Severe renal impairment , define individual creatinine clearance &lt; 30 milliliter ( mL ) /minute ( min ) determine 24hour urine creatinine clearance do screening . Renally impaired subject must clinical laboratory test result consider clinically stable opinion principal investigator . Subjects laboratory parameter outside reference range may include , opinion investigator medical monitor , finding interfere study introduce additional safety risk subject . Body weight &gt; = 50 kilogram ( kg ) body mass index ( BMI ) within range 19 38 kg/ meter ( ) ^2 ( inclusive ) Male female A female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative serum hCG test ) , lactate .
