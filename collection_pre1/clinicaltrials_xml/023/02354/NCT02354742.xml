	<brief_summary>Echocardiography ( cardiac ultrasound ) use often critical care set management severe infection ( septic shock ) . Early study show echocardiography useful patient , time , good clinical trial justify use . Our study goals/objectives follow : 1 . To conduct unblinded , two-group randomize controlled clinical trial compare echocardiography-guided resuscitation protocol Early Goal Directed Therapy ( EGDT ) protocol patient severe sepsis septic shock . 2 . Demonstrate sepsis treatment protocol use transthoracic echocardiography non-invasive assessment cardiac output result rapid resolution septic shock compare invasive EGDT . 3 . Demonstrate patient receive non-invasive echocardiography protocol receive less administration intravenous fluid .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>At least 18 year age Suspected infection Two systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) criteria White blood cell count le 4,000 per mm3 , great 12,000 per mm3 , differential great 10 % immature form Heart rate great 90 beat per minute Respiratory rate great 20 breath per minute paCO2 le 32 mmHg Temperature le 36°C great 38°C Evidence refractory hypoperfusion attribute sepsis ( one follow ) : Systolic blood pressure le 90 mmHg despite intravenous fluid challenge least 30ml/kg ( portion may albumin equivalent ) Blood lactate level least 4 mmol/L . Intention place arterial catheter . Intention place central venous catheter . Exclusion criterion : Known pregnancy Requirement immediate surgery Hypotension attribute alternative cause Treating physician deems patient moribund Treating physician deem aggressive care unsuitable Contraindication central venous catheterization arterial catheterization Advanced directives restrict implementation protocol Significant pathology chest abdominal wall would make transthoracic echocardiography impossible ( burn , chest trauma , etc . ) Children age 18 include study</criteria>
