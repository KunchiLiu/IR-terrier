	<brief_summary>Part 1 ( Phase 1 ) : safety tolerability bevacizumab-Niraparib combination Part 2 ( Randomized Phase 2 ) : compare Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) PARP inhibitor active monotherapy treat patient recurrent ovarian cancer ; strong activity observe platinum sensitive , gBRCAmut subgroup well gBRCAwt , HRD population also HRD negative disease . In population level one evidence bevacizumab beneficial . And phase two randomize study indicate combination PARP inhibitor anti-angiogenic drug superior PARP inhibitor alone . The question : Is niraparib combined bevacizumab superior niraparib ? The comparison tolerability efficacy niraparib-bevacizumab combination niraparib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Niraparib Versus Niraparib-bevacizumab Combination Women With Platinum-sensitive Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 : This single-centre , phase 1a , open-label , dose-escalation study evaluate safety tolerability bevacizumab-niraparib combination determine RP2D patient platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . The standard 3+3 design use . Part 2 : ( n=94 ) This multicenter , prospective , open-label , randomized phase 2 study evaluate efficacy niraparib niraparib-bevacizumab combination Women platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . Stratification : Patients stratify accord : 1 . HRD status ( positive/negative ) 2 . Treatment-Free interval prior therapy ( 6-12 month &gt; 12 month ) Randomization : 1:1 randomization Study arm : Patients randomize one two treatment arm : Arm 1 : Niraparib monotherapy progression . Arm 2 : Niraparib-bevacizumab combination therapy progression .</detailed_description>
