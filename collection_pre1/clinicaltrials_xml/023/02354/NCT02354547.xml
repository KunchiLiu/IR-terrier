	<brief_title>A Study SGT-53 Children With Refractory Recurrent Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The p53 vital human tumor suppressor gene . Loss p53 suppressor function present majority human cancer . The p53 protein diverse range function include regulation cell cycle checkpoint , cell death ( apoptosis ) , senescence , DNA repair , maintenance genomic integrity , control angiogenesis . Abnormalities p53 gene may impact efficacy standard anticancer treatment radiation chemotherapy . P53 mutation pathway dysfunction associate poor clinical outcome presence p53 mutation correlate resistance chemotherapy radiation . The development somatic gene therapy create potential restore wild type function p53 . SGT-53 complex cationic liposome encapsulate normal human wild type p53 DNA sequence plasmid backbone . This complex show efficiently specifically deliver p53 cDNA tumor cell . Introduction p53 cDNA sequence expect restore wtp53 function apoptotic pathway . P53 restoration show effective enhance cytotoxicity combination agent result DNA damage initiate apoptosis . Though mutated p53 uncommon childhood cancer , child adrenocortical tumor rhabdomyosarcoma find p53 mutation . Additionally , wild type p53 may suppress tumor pathway crosstalk . For example , sarcoma , common childhood solid tumor , activation MDM2 effectively inactivate p53 . Thus , treatment propose trial reintroduce p53 may offer benefit even patient p53 wild-type tumor . Moreover , SGT-53 treatment significantly sensitize pediatric cancer cell line kill effect standard chemotherapeutic agent , topotecan cyclophosphamide . Thus , propose ass efficacy combination therapy pediatric patient refractory recurrent solid tumor . This phase I clinical trial determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , recommend phase 2 dose , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) SGT-53 ( reach ) alone combination conventional chemotherapy pediatric patient recurrent refractory solid tumor . In addition , pharmacokinetics escalate dos SGT-53 study .</detailed_description>
