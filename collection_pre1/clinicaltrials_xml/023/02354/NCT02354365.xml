	<brief_summary>Typically doctor adjust setting ventilator ensure child receive enough help decrease work perform breathe , receive enough oxygen machine pas blood organ , remove acid build blood . However , sometimes setting choose result damage lung . We try find good way determine best ventilator setting , minimize potential damage lung , still provide child enough support decrease work breathe . We believe personalize choice child look pressure generate chest child breathe ventilator . This accomplish use small tube go nose esophagus stomach , hook computer ventilator monitor pressure . This tube also use monitor much work child need breathe turn ventilator preparation remove breathe tube .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Any patient weigh &gt; 2 kg age &gt; 37 week correct gestational age &lt; 18 year intubate mechanically ventilate eligible study . We seek group patient 3 potential cohort : . Normal Lungs ( maximum 30 patient ) : Mechanically ventilate patient without pulmonary parenchymal disease lower airway disease measure flow volume loop consistent expiratory flow obstruction ( e.g . seizure , apnea , upper airway obstruction ) . ii . AHRF ( maximum 15 patient ) : Mechanically ventilate patient two consecutive Saturation FiO2 ( SF ) ratio &lt; 265 PaO2 FiO2 ( PF ) ratio &lt; 300 ( e.g . pneumonia , ARDS ) . iii . Obstructive airway disease ( 15 patient ) : Mechanically ventilate patient flow volume loop consistent expiratory flow obstruction ( e.g . asthma , bronchiolitis ) . Patients correct gestational age &lt; 37 week 18 year age . Patients esophageal pathology inability utilize esophageal probe due anatomy , high frequency oscillator jet ventilator uncorrected persistent cyanotic congenital heart diseases exclude . Also , patient endotracheal tube leak 18 % inability measure volume , pressure flow endotracheal tube exclude study . Participation study last duration mechanical ventilation pulmonary measurement take initial phase well wean phase mechanical ventilation . Once patient enrol informed consent obtain , esophageal catheter insert remain place extubation . The available catheter ( 7 16 French ) use similar size feeding tube use intubated patient . These catheters/feeding tube often use PICU NICUs FDA 510K approve . There publish data PICU use catheter neonatal population . For neonate young patient 2 kg 10 kg , use 7Fr catheter . For old patient &gt; 10 kg , use 16 Fr catheter . Patients intubate study similar size feeding catheter ( manometer function ) routinely place bedside nurse staff feed temperature monitoring purpose . The esophageal catheter function manometer well feed tube stay place duration mechanical ventilation . The manometer part catheter locate 1/3 catheter catheter 's distal port serf feed tube project stomach . We limit placement esophageal catheter three attempt per day . Once optimal position , need re-adjust catheter pressure monitor feeding purpose . The catheter stay place duration mechanical ventilation . Confirmation esophageal catheter placement make patient obtains daily chest x-ray routine clinical care . There additional radiation exposure intubate patient participate study participate study . The esophageal catheter connect Avea mechanical ventilator part check ensure properly function . In order facilitate TPP measurement , patient need well sedate . During routine nursing care , mechanically ventilated patient either receive continuous bolus sedation medication . We time TPP measurement do patient receive bolus sedation medication . Baseline ventilator setting collect . At patient ' baseline ventilator setting , cardiac output ( CO ) measure use ultrasound cardiac output monitor ( USCOM ) . TPP measurement obtain PEEP perform expiratory hold ventilator . TPP obtain PIP perform inspiratory hold ventilator . Once TPP measurement complete , PEEP adjust 2cm H2O increment TPP . For every 2cm H2O adjustment ventilator , observe patient tolerance ventilator change 2 minute . If patient show sign intolerance ( decrease SpO2 &gt; 5 % , increase end tidal CO2 10 torr , heart rate &gt; 40 bpm baseline , clinical respiratory distress ) , ventilator setting return baseline . Once PEEP adjust TPP , CO measure use USCOM . Measurements ( CO , TPP PEEP , TPP PIP ) do three time ensure reproducibility average measurement three use data description . TPP measurement do daily 7 day . We discontinue TPP measurement patient recover enter wean phase mechanical ventilation ( clinically determine primary care team PICU ) . The average length mechanical ventilation child PICU 5-6 day , therefore estimate number TPP measurements 5-6 measurement . For late part study , patient consistently breathe spontaneously enter wean phase ventilation , esophageal catheter use first part study use measure pressure rate product surrogate work breathe patient trialed minimal ventilator support . The esophageal catheter connect Bicore , device monitor pulmonary measurement use esophageal catheter obtain pressure rate product measurement . The PRP measure decrease set minimal ventilator support ( start pressure support/PEEP 10/5 cm H20 5/5 cm H20 CPAP 5cm H20 ) . Patients place set 5 minute period monitor sign intolerance ( decrease SpO2 &gt; 5 % , increase end tidal CO2 10 torr , heart rate &gt; 40 bpm baseline , clinical respiratory distress ) . Should patient tolerate decrease setting support , ventilator setting return baseline prior change make . Analysis largely descriptive provide information development transpulmonary pressure base protocol ventilator management . Specifically , examine typical difference PEEP set clinician , recommend available PEEP/FiO2 titration table ( ARDSNET 2000 ) recommend base transpulmonary pressure , determine whether would potential difference choice PEEP base method choose . We use data explore decision point peak inspiratory pressure , compare difference airway pressure alveolar pressure , particularly PEEP change . Finally , aim 2 , seek determine potential decrease number day mechanical ventilation minimum effort breathe use determination extubation readiness . This inform power calculation future study may consider endpoint , rather actual extubation .</detailed_description>
