	<brief_title>The Effect Water-exercise Low Back Pain Sick Leave , Among Healthy Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain occur frequently pregnancy . Studies show prevalence 50 70 % pregnant woman indicate general problem . Low back pain increase gestational age show important contribute factor sick leave pregnancy . Low back pain also negative impact ability perform daily chore . It therefore important focus prevent reduce low back pain pregnant woman . Some study suggest exercise decrease pain intensity low back pain pregnancy . However , woman reduce intensity exercise time spend exercise pregnancy , many woman exercise , despite national international recommendation advise pregnant woman physically active moderate intensity level least 30 minute per day . The reason reduction physical exercise level attribute grow body , pregnancy complication sense insecurity exercising . Exercise swim exercise water show increasingly used pregnancy , pregnant woman feel comfortable safe performing exercise water . Two randomized intervention study find water-exercise pregnancy diminish low back pain reduce number day spend sick leave . In study , intervention supervise group take place day schedule time . These result indicate supervised water-exercise may beneficial effect healthy pregnant woman . In Denmark , unsupervised water exercise program healthy pregnant woman , AquaMama , implement public swimming pool 2011 . However , evidence effect unsupervised water exercise program intensity low back pain number day spend sick leave . We therefore develop unsupervised individual water exercise program basis AquaMama supplement supportive component test randomize controlled trial . Recruitment Pregnant woman recruit Department Obstetrics , Rigshospitalet , Copenhagen , Denmark . The woman select basis due date time water exercise intervention 20th 32nd week gestation . The woman eligible participation invite participate mail invitation send post enclose description project . After one week woman contact telephone email invite interview , physical examination pelvic fill baseline questionnaire . Intervention - One introduction session - Unsupervised water-exercises , duration 45 min , twice week 12 week - A weekly supportive email Statistical analysis plan General statistical consideration : The primary data analysis perform base intention-to-treat principle . Baseline data ( parity , previous low back pain ) two group compare : For quantitative data t-test apply data sufficiently normal , otherwise Kruskal-Wallis test apply . Categorical data compare Fisher chi-square test , latter apply condition expect value large 5 fulfil . A t-test applied compare mean primary outcome two group . Similarly secondary outcome compare use t-tests . For secondary outcome , p-values adjust multiple test use Benjamini-Hochberg correction method . If data sufficiently normally distribute , transformation apply possible . To explore impact parity previous low back pain score outcome , additional linear regression analysis outcomes perform In case influential observation ( probably relevant number day sick leave ) , robust regression technique apply . Per- protocol analysis perform pregnant woman perform â‰¥ 75 % training session . The significance level set 0.05 . Sample size assessment : Sample size calculation base following condition : - 2 point reduction numerical pain scale 0-10 , patient experience reduction pain clinically important . - The Average high pain baseline 5.8 SD = 3 ( 3 ; 35 ) . -A total 70 % pregnant woman experience low back pain . - We assume effect intervention 2.0 point participant complete full program . - It estimate 50 % participant follow program least 75 % session ( high participation , 19-24 session ) 35 % follow 50-75 % ( moderate participation , 12 -18 session ) 15 % follow less half program ( low participation ) . We estimate effect high participation training course reduction 2 point , effect moderate participation training course reduction 1 point , low participation result reduction . This give overall reduction intervention group 1.35 point ( 0.50 * 2 + 0.35 * 1 + 0.15 * 0 = 1.35 ) . A difference pain level 1.35 ( SD = 3.0 ) available power 90 % significance level 5 % ( two-sided ) 150 participant group . Strategy case miss outcome For outcomes less 5 percent miss data , complete case analyse report . If percentage miss data exceeds 5 , sensitivity analysis base worst-best best-worst imputation apply ( experimental arm imputing bad / best outcomes observe control arm miss outcome vice versa control arm ) . In case analysis give rise conclusion complete case analysis , latter report . Otherwise data assume Missing At Random ( MAR ) analyse perform use Maximum-Likelihood Inverse Probability Weighting .</detailed_description>
