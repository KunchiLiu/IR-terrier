	<brief_summary>What heart failure normal ejection fraction ? The heart contract ( pump ) relax heartbeat . In people heart failure , heart contract normally reduce relaxation heart . As result , people notice feel breathlessness , ankle swell fatigue especially exertion . The investigator feel patient reduce impaired relaxation heart less heart fill time poor energy utilisation exercise . Therefore , investigator conduct study thoroughly understand disease condition give drug call ivabradine reduce heart rate hence increase heart filling time patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Chronotropic Incompetence Heart Failure With Normal Ejection Fraction ( HFNEF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE About 50 % patient heart failure normal ejection fraction ( HFNEF ) . Although traditionally consider benign disorder relate heart failure reduce ejection fraction ( HFREF ) , mortality figure patient HFNEF HFREF know comparable . Surprisingly , despite HFNEF 's importance major health concern , pathophysiological basis HFNEF 's remains poorly understood commentator even suggest HFNEF 's pathophysiology variant HFREF . Further confound understanding HFNEF , exist study include heterogenous patient stratified ethnicity age assess rest . Such patient may exhibit physiology typically elderly female HFNEF patient experience symptom exertion . Elucidating mechanisms underlying HFNEF press paucity evidence even begin guide therapy . In absence supportive trial evidence , clinical practice predicate assumption make regard physiology diastolic ( dy ) function . For example , rate limitation often advocate HFNEF base 19th century observation Lewis Katz high heart rate , shorten diastolic filling period impairs cardiac filling result low stroke volume . Such empirical practice beset HFNEF 's complexity . A consistent feature HFNEF reduce chronotropic reserve . In one study HFNEF patient assess invasively use pressure-volume loop basal condition handgrip exercise atrial pacing 120bpm . It conclude high heart rate , significant blunt frequency-dependent ventricular relaxation rate-related diastolic chamber stiffness compromise stroke volume explain exertional limitation . Other investigator dispute aberrancy diastolic fill limitation , question potential benefit heart rate limitation use beta-blockers raise potential pacing treatment HNEF . We confirm impaired chronotropic reserve HFNEF . We also demonstrate dynamic slow LV relaxation exercise associate potentially attributable impaired cardiac energetics ( albeit rest ) 9 . However , determine pertinence heart rate inadequate exertional reserve HFNEF , heart rate need manipulate complex neurohormonal , autonomic haemodynamic context exercise . The fundamental limitation exist study , include utilize pace handgrip , exercise physiology recapitulate . Cardiac MR accurate versatile method phenotyping heart research study , assess cardiac volume mass unparalleled accuracy reproducibility . 31P MRS technique allow non-invasive measurement cardiac high-energy phosphate metabolism vivo . Our department develop 31P-MRS protocol allow measure high energy phosphate molecule rest exercise Cardiopulmonary exercise test peak oxygen consumption measurement show reliable mechanistic readout integrate cardiac function heart failure preserve ejection fraction9 , . It also safe reliable elderly patient heart failure . In summary , chronotropic incompetence could either compensatory phenomenon serve limit cardiac energetic depletion exercise also increase diastolic fill context abbreviate diastolic filling time due dynamic slow active relaxation . Alternatively might contribute exercise limitation limit cardiac output augmentation exercise ( since cardiac output product heart rate stroke volume ) . In order investigate LV fill cardiac output pathophysiology HFNEF , employ Ivabradine , reduce heart rate direct effect contractile/lusitropic function vascular tone . Ivabradine indicate symptomatic chronic stable angina patient unable tolerate contra-indication use beta-blockers . It use combination beta-blockers whose heart rate &gt; 60 bpm . We use ivabradine pharmacological tool investigate diastolic filling/function hence effect cardiac function metabolism energy . Ivabradine dose extensively validate deem safe previous study ( Beautiful study ) . The common side effect transient enhance brightness limited area visual field , usually trigger sudden variation light intensity blur vision . Other common side effect bradycardia , headache dizziness possibly related bradycardia . Ivabradine metabolise CYP3A4 concomitant use potent CYP3A4 inhibitor azole antifungal ( ketoconazole , itraconazole ) , macrolide antibiotic ( clarithromycin , erythromycin , josamycin , telithromycin ) , HIV protease inhibitor nefazodone contraindicate . The combination ivabradine heart rate reduce agent diltiazem verapamil recommend . Other drug combination ivabradine recommend QT prolongation drug ( quinidine , disopyramide , bepridil , sotalol , ibutilide , amiodarone , pimozide , ziprasidone , sertindole , mefloquine , halofantrine , pentamidine ) . Combination ivabradine beta-blockers , ACE inhibitor , angiotensin II antagonist , diuretic , short long act nitrate , HMG CoA reductase inhibitor , fibrates , proton pump inhibitor , oral antidiabetic , aspirin , anti-platelet agent find safe . Although clinical trial , assess impact lower heart rate exercise patient HFNEF match patient hypertension exercise limitation order begin understand role heart rate diastolic physiology . Patient selection Through HFNEF community screen programme , via heart failure clinic Oxford identify 30 patient HFNEF meet ESC criterion additionally peak VO2 ≤ 85 % cardiac pattern exercise limitation CPEX ; 30 match hypertensive control without HFNEF ( subjective complaint breathlessness peak V02 &gt; 90 % age gender predict ) recruit studied Aberdeen research team lead Professor Michael Frenneaux . 20 match healthy subject recruit Oxford provide normal reference value study examination baseline . STUDY DESIGN Summary study design This research project 3 group do 2 different centre , Oxford Aberdeen . Both HFNEF hypertensive control ( positive control ) participate prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover design consist two experimental period ( Ivabradine 7.5mg bd v placebo two week two week washout ) . Normal control ( negative control ) undergo baseline assessment give Ivabradine placebo . Group 1 ( University Oxford ) This do research team lead Dr Houman Ashrafian Prof S Neubauer . 30 patient HFNEF , least 60 year old recruit heart failure clinic John Radcliffe Hospital HFNEF community screen programme Oxford 24-month period . Only VO2max ≤ 85 % cardiac pattern exercise limitation CPEX screening include study . At end screen visit , eligible subject randomly assign one possible experimental sequence . Each subject receive either Ivabradine 7.5mg bd match placebo tablet ( Period 1 ) , follow 2-week washout period , placebo Ivabradine 7.5mg bd final 2-week period ( Period 2 ) . The subject study investigator blind randomization schedule . Patients evaluate baseline end two experimental period John Radcliffe hospital . All evaluation day last approximately 4 hour . Elderly participant allow perform MRI/MRS next day . Group 2 ( University Aberdeen ) This do research team lead Professor Michael Frenneaux . 30 match hypertensive control , without heart failure symptoms least 65 year old recruit Aberdeen 24-month period . Only VO2max &gt; 90 % predict CPEX screen include study . Elderly participant allow perform nuclear study MRI/MRS next day . Group 3 ( Normal Subjects ) 20 match normal control , least 18 year old recruit Oxford 24-month period . All participant undergo Visit 1 test give Ivabradine placebo . Study Procedures Eligibility patient check predefined inclusion/exclusion criterion time attendance heart failure clinic ( Oxford ) , cardiology clinic , cardiac investigation department relevant clinic John Radcliffe hospital ( hypertension , diabetes e.t.c . ) hypertension/cardiology clinic ( Aberdeen Royal Infirmary ) clinical team .
