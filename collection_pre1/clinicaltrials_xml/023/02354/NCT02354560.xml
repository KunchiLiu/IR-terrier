	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) lead cause cancer relate mortality western world lifetime risk 6 % . Etiology complex , genetic background significantly affect risk . Around one third genetic disorder well case Familial Adenomatous Polyposis ( FAP ) large proportion sporadic CRC case occur result premature nonsense mutation ( create stop codon ) individual 's adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene . Nonsense mutation single-point alteration DNA prematurely halt protein translation process , produce shorten , nonfunctional protein . In many case , cell 'persuaded ' ignore premature stop codon signal , result protein may able ameliorate stop disease . Recently , member aminoglycoside family antibiotic find induce ribosomal read-through nonsense mutation , lead expression full length , functional protein . Investigators recently show member aminoglycoside macrolide antibiotic family induce read-through nonsense mutation APC gene lead reduce oncogenic phenotype CRC cell different mouse model . The aim project determine ability macrolide antibiotic-erythromycin induce read-through nonsense mutation APC gene induce expression full length , functional APC protein patient suffer FAP test effect adenoma number size desmoid tumor patient . The future goal maximize effect stop-codon suppressor APC minimize side effect . In study investigator select FAP patient carry APC nonsense mutation , treat erythromycin PO 4-6 month examine colonic duodenal adenoma well abdominal desmoid tumor , document treatment . In parallel , investigator test polyp , adenoma desmoid tissue sample well blood sample patient change expression level APC protein relate oncogenic marker . Suppression nonsense mutation within APC gene benefit patient suffer FAP , attenuate FAP multiple adenoma patient advance diffuse CRC . Furthermore , give rapid progress make identification different nonsense mutation human gene lead mostly un-curable disease , identification clinically approve compound suppress nonsense mutation administer long-term without significant side effect would open new venue treatment genetic human disease arise pre-mature stop codon important coding sequence . Immediate goal : establish ability erythromycin read-through APC nonsense mutation FAP patient . The read-through effect erythromycin clinically test count measure number size colonic duodenal adenoma treatment measure size know desmoid tumor . Samples adenomas desmoid tumor test western blot , immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry restoration APC expression change oncogenic marker . These experiment conduct within 6 month . Long term objective : 1 . Determine low dose erythromycin inhibit growth colonic neoplasia CRC patient express truncated APC protein due nonsense mutation . 2 . Examine ability panel additional macrolide antibiotic induce APC nonsense mutation suppression use in-vitro method . Investigators focus macrolide antibiotic currently clinical use administrate long term . These objective take around 6 month conduct parallel .</brief_summary>
