	<brief_summary>The LIMIT-Study placebo-controlled , double-blinded randomize controlled trial design explore efficacy carrageenan-based lubricant topical microbicide prevent HPV acquisition . Individuals high risk infection ( men sex men , MSM , especially HIV ) include trial . Participants complete self-administered baseline questionnaire enrolment visit , follow-up questionnaire six visit . The short follow-up questionnaire intend evaluate recent sexual behaviour corroborate response give baseline visit . These questionnaire measure HPV risk factor , compliance , monitor safety tolerability gel . Between follow-up visit , participant ask log secure web module least week answer question daily sexual activity , condom study gel use , adverse even . Individuals screen eligibility telephone person eligible men attend enrolment visit , nurse obtain informed consent instruct participant gel use . They receive one month 's supply gel provide first specimen . Random number set assign treatment control gel . Each participant assign individual code , use match study arm . Lastly , nurse provide detail HPV infection advice condom use sexual health . HPV infection status measure use anal specimen baseline ( enrolment/time 0 ) , follow-up clinic visit ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lubricant Investigation Men Inhibit Transmission HPV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) inhibitory compound might useful topical microbicides block spread HPV . Recent in-vitro in-vivo laboratory study demonstrate strong inhibitory property carrageenan ( inexpensive gelling agent non-toxic safe animal human ) HPV type . So far , clinical trial design ass carrageenan-based personal lubricant topical microbicide Men Sex Men ( MSM ) population . Since introduction HAART therapy 1996 , paradoxical effect incidence anal cancer , disease cause HPV . Whereas patient would formerly die AIDS-related ailment , men undergo HAART therapy increase longevity , thus allow disease longer natural history anal cancer develop . Low CD4 count , high HPV incidence long duration infection contribute elevate risk anal lesion cancer among MSMs HIV nearly 80 time general male population . Although HPV vaccination approve male Canada , exclusively prophylactic , i.e . prevent HPV infection exposure occur . But consider MSMs already expose vaccine target type , benefit population limit . Furthermore , current vaccination protect two 14 oncogenic HPV type . The primary aim study evaluate efficacy carrageenan reduce type-specific anal HPV incidence , i.e. , prevent infection new HPV type sexually active MSM . Secondary aim : 1 ) evaluate efficacy carrageenan reduce type-specific anal HPV prevalence , i.e. , accelerate clearance exist infection sexually active MSM ; 2 ) compare efficacy carrageenan type-specific prevention clearance anal HPV infection among MSM without HIV , i.e. , evaluate whether carrageenan equally effective among subgroup ; 3 ) ass safety tolerability propose gel patient adherence intervention , i.e. , parameter important future clinical use . To permit verification study 's objective sufficient power end one-year follow-up period , propose recruit 380 subject ( 110 HIV+ 270 HIV- ) . We recruit subject live HIV 5 HIV/AIDS outpatient clinic Montreal : Clinique Médicale du Quartier-Latin , Clinique L'Actuel , Clinique OPUS , Unité d'Hospitalisation de Recherche et d'Enseignement sur le Soins du SIDA ( UHRESS ) Centre Hospitalier de L'Université de Montréal ( CHUM ) Chronic Viral Illnesses Service McGill University Health Centre ( MUHC ) . We advertise bar , sex health club , various medium , abovementioned clinics—with addition McGill University Student Health Services . MSMs without HIV recruit . For HIV , chart review perform enrolment collect information CD4+ count , viral load , HAART status , year HIV diagnosis , nadir CD4+ count . HIV test also perform MSMs without HIV verify status . Volunteer MSMs live Montreal randomized receive either ) treatment carrageenan self-applied anal microbicide gel , b ) treatment placebo gel apply way . Our specific primary aim evaluate efficacy carrageenan reduce anal HPV incidence , i.e. , prevent new HPV infection sexually active MSMs . Additional secondary aim include : evaluate efficacy carrageenan reduce anal HPV prevalence ( i.e. , accelerate clearance exist infection sexually active MSMs ) , evaluate difference efficacy carrageenan prevention clearance HPV infection individual live without HIV , evaluate patient adherence measure behavioural characteristic assess mean questionnaire . Participants randomize either carrageenan placebo gel variable block randomization algorithm blind intervention . Demographics , risk factor , compliance information collect via computerized questionnaire baseline ( enrolment/ time 0 ) , 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month post-enrolment . HPV DNA detection genotyping anal sample do clinic visit PGMY polymerase chain reaction protocol . Measuring efficacy intervention do test null hypothesis difference time HPV infection ( i.e. , infection HPV type present baseline ) treatment group log rank test . We use Cox proportional hazard regression model estimate hazard ratio 95 % CI HPV infection treatment versus placebo group . We also use survival analysis technique measure clearance infection HPV type present enrolment accord intervention . Our analysis conduct separately accord participant HIV status , eventually pool result find similar group . We perform analysis accord intention-to-treat approach ( i.e. , include participant randomize receive least one-month 's supply gel ) , according-to-protocol approach ( i.e. , include participant comply protocol ) . Considering HPV infection responsible 90 % anal cancer case , well much suffering due genital wart , potential microbicide-based approach disease prevention overemphasize . Our team extensive experience study HPV epidemiology Montreal subject recruitment resource already place . ( Full protocol available upon request )</detailed_description>
