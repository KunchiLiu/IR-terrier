	<brief_title>HYPOCHOL : A Genetically-based Strategy Identify New Targets Cholesterol Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal recruit 400 subject : 200 adult subject familial hypobetalipoproteinemia ( FHBL ) ( index case ) plus 200 additional related subject least 10 large informative FHBL family , know mutation FHBL gene . The patient care modify : patient Hospital Anxiety Depression ( HAD ) questionnaire ( focus depressive syndrome ) , food diary , additional blood analysis ( include genetic analysis ) . One main issue recruit FHBL patient fact asymptomatic FHBL identify serious illness general physician . Step-1 . Excluding mutation select candidate gene As first approach screen candidate gene exclude patient know mutation , investigator develop custom design base Haloplex™ technology ( Agilent® Technologies ) perform high-throughput sequence cod region 10 gene , include previously describe FHBL ( apolipoprotein B ( APOB ) , Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( PCSK9 ) ) , Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( MTP ABL ) , chylomicron retention disease ( CMRD ) , Secretion associate , Ras relate GTPase ( SARA2 gene ) , well 6 additional candidate gene cholesterol metabolism ( low density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLR ) , Sortilin ( SORT1 ) , Inducible Degrader LDL receptor ( IDOL ) , Cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP ) , Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) Angiopoietin-like Protein 3 ( ANGTPL3 ) ) . All recruit index case ( n=200 ) genotyped select without mutation previously describe gene , approximately 50 % index case cohort . Step-2 . Identification informative family exome sequence In patient without identified mutation , investigator conduct familial screen order identify case FHBL among proband relative . An analysis fast plasma lipid parameter ( total cholesterol ( TC ) , High density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , Low-Density Lipoproteins ( LDL-C ) triglyceride ( TG ) ) perform related . Affected subject determine spontaneous LDL-C &lt; 80 mg/dl and/or apoB &lt; 50 mg/dl . In contrast , non-affected subject display LDL-C &gt; 80 mg/dl and/or apoB &gt; 50 mg/dl . For large family , investigator combine whole-exome sequencing linkage analysis identify novel genetic variant likely explain FHBL . Depending family pedigree , whole-exome sequencing ( WES ) perform 2 5 patient per family . All relative genotyped linkage analysis . In parallel genetic approach , regional epidemiological analysis perform identify geographical cluster high prevalence disease , develop project name VaCaRMe ( Vascular Cardiac , Respiratory Metabolic overcome disease ) An additional aim , base exhaustive phenotyping FHBL patient , investigate safety low LDL-C perform genotype-phenotype correlation patient FHBL population .

	<criteria>For index case without family screening : Patient HBL : fasting LDLC ≤ 50 mg/dl . For familial affected case : Relative HBL : fasting LDLC ≤ 80 mg/dl and/or Apo B ≤ 50 mg/dl least one relate family case suffer HBL . All subject , include familial nonaffected case , must give write consent ( dated sign ) participate constitution biobank ( include DNA sample urine sample ) . Use lipidlowering drug ( statin , fibrates , ezetimibe , bileacid sequester resin ) nutraceuticals know affect lipid ( red yeast rice , margarine dairy plant sterol ) Patient screen within extreme metabolic disturbance ( emergency situation , sepsis , hospitalization intensive care unit ) Patients hyperthyroidism , severe liver failure , end stage chronic kidney disease , serious pancreatic failure , anemia relate thalassemia sickle cell disease , strict vegan diet malnutrition Refusal patient legal representative participate study ''</criteria>
