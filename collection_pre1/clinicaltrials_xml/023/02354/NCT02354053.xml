	<brief_summary>Modern antiretroviral therapeutic regimen offer vast array choice permit tailor therapy HIV patient . While modern regimen improve rate virologic suppression overall reduce adverse effect antiretroviral treatment , important sub-group HIV infect person unable maintain adherence treatment regimen , fail achieve long term virologic control remain risk HIV related disease progression transmission HIV infection . Hypothesis : switching current cART regimen Triumeq base regimen combine adherence support improve rate HIV suppression vulnerable population non-adherent current cART determine achievement HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL Week 24 post randomization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Switching From Current cART Triumeq With Adherence Support Will Enhance HIV Control Vulnerable Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : To determine switch current cART regimen Triumeq base regimen combine adherence support improve rate HIV suppression vulnerable population non-adherent current cART determine achievement HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL Week 24 post randomization . Secondary objective : In vulnerable population non-adherent current cART : ( ) To determine switch current cART Triumeq base regimen improve average adherence patient compare maintain current cART , measure 24 week post randomization . ( ii ) To determine adherence maintain long term ( 72 week ) subject receive Triumeq ( iii ) To evaluate effect switch Triumeq control HIV infection ( measure HIV viral load CD4 cell count ) 72 week ( iv ) To determine safety use Triumeq respect risk emergence HIV drug resistance . ( vi ) To assess safety tolerability ( include hepatic function metabolic profile ) switch current cART regimen Triumeq 72 week . ( vi ) To evaluate switch Triumeq cost effective societal prospective Study Population : We recruit 14 CTN-affiliated site across Canada . All patient recruit trial adult age 18 year old document HIV infection ( ELISA western blot confirmation ) negative HLA-B5701 testing . Prescribed ART may include DHHS recommend alternative regimen , treat physician considers , appropriate patient ( except dolutegravir ) least 6 month . Subjects evidence non-adherence current ART regimen define : - HIV RNA ≥400 copies/ml least last 12 month - Absence evidence resistance component current regimen Triumeq - Viremia explain normal viral decay initiate ART We anticipate many recruited subject comprise people inject drug , Aborginal person person ethnocultural community however recruitment limited group others may enrol provided meet inclusion criterion . Study design : A randomized , prospective , open-label study . Patients randomize 1:1 switch Triumeq vs. remain current cART . Both group receive adherence support . Those randomized maintain current cART permit switch Triumeq 24 week . Sample size : N = 100 100 patient ( 50/arm ) provide 80 % power detect 25 % difference virologic suppression rate two arm 24 week . While difference large , population target consider improvement virologic suppression rate least amount would require clinically meaningful .</detailed_description>
