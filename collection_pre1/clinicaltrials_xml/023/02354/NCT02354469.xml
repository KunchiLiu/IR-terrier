	<brief_summary>Recently , researcher clinician examine many different form concussion test aim assess brain injury occur degree affect individual test . Due multifaceted complex presentation concussive injury unknown effect repeat head trauma , unlikely single test physiological behavioral function reflect full range injury-related damage concussive event series cumulative head trauma , well injury response within brain tissue . However , combine variety objective assessment may detect structural functional alteration follow head trauma single study , clear understand multi-faceted presentation result head trauma may identify . The identification biomarkers utilization objective clinically feasible tool provide method ass three domain across multiple system affect head trauma : 1 ) prognostic value initial concussion assessment identify injury severity factor responsible prolonged recovery , 2 ) temporal window recovery potential vulnerability brain tissue post-injury , 3 ) long-term alteration associate repeated head trauma exposure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Student athlete contact collision sport , well non-contact sport , complete comprehensive assessment neurological behavioral function season participation . Additionally , sustain concussion undergo post-injury test timeline assess within 5 day injury follow time point : 3-4 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year post-injury . Each individual completes test concussion subject match healthy control subject height , weight , age , sport , position , control subject complete protocol similar time increment subject concussion . Through study design , hypothesize able detect objective deficit result concussion within one week injury determine feasibility add value comprehensive neurological behavioral test battery comparison metric injure healthy collegiate student athlete . Additionally , hypothesize athlete sustain concussion , decrements pre-season post-season time point great participate collision/contact sport comparison participate non-contact sport . Thus , outcome study enhance understanding pathophysiology concussion rigorous laboratory test component , simultaneous direct translation clinical implementation use highly-feasible clinical test paradigm possess potential ubiquitous widespread use throughout sport medicine practice .</detailed_description>
