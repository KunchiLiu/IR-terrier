	<brief_summary>The study demonstrate non-inferiority spironolactone vs. eplerenone preserve cardiac pulmonary function patient preserve LV ejection fraction . Males Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) confirm clinically mutation analysis enrol . Subjects randomize either eplerenone spironolactone . Subjects use drug diary record daily compliance take study medication well concern may study period . Subjects undergo cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) pulmonary function test ( PFT ) baseline 12 month post enrollment . Subjects also complete quality life questionnaire baseline 12 month . Degree elbow contracture measure use goniometer baseline 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DMD X-linked disorder sarcolemmal protein dystrophin effectively absent . Males DMD typically die third fourth decade life cardiopulmonary disease . Mouse model DMD , autopsy data , vivo human study use magnetic resonance-based late gadolinium enhancement imaging ( LGE ) show progressive myocardial damage well underway leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LV EF ) become abnormal . Exertional symptom sign myocardial disease typically absent skeletal muscle disease progressively limit functional capacity affect boy . Thus , cardiac involvement go undetected LV dysfunction myocardial fibrosis advance . While echocardiography remain useful tool evaluate LV dysfunction , CMR LGE advantageous DMD patient since identifies myocardial injury decline EF apparent echocardiography . Further , great reproducibility affords efficient sample size cardiomyopathy clinical trial patient rare disease . CMR 's increase availability DMD clinical center afford earlier cardiomyopathy detection , help refine current management typically include agent angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) damage evident . This strategy , however , may sufficient , prior study show decline systolic function without ACEI angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) therapy . The investigator previously test mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism ( MRA ) add ACEI EF still normal mouse model mimic myocardial damage see DMD patient . This combination significantly reduce myocardial injury improve ( make negative ) LV circumferential strain ( Ecc ) , sensitive early marker LV systolic dysfunction . Additionally , preliminary finding recently complete clinical trial suggest efficacy eplerenone vs. placebo , preclinical data suggest great benefit without concomitant steroid use . Thus , non-inferiority trial compare MRAs need .</detailed_description>
