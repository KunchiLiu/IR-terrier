	<brief_summary>The primary study objective determine efficacy ondansetron ( 0.33 mg twice daily ) administer orally period 16 week reduce risky drinking among currently drink subject alcohol use disorder select genotype serotonin transporter receptor gene . The secondary objective ass safety tolerability ondansetron subject alcohol use disorder select genotype serotonin transporter receptor gene .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenetic Study Ondansetron Alcohol Use Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) heterogeneous chronic relapse disorder include acute ( binge drinking ) chronic ( frequent heavy drinking ) dimension . Perhaps heterogeneity , therapeutic effect size approve medicine treatment AUD small . In effort overcome heterogeneity response particular medication , recent study institute personalized approach therapy . Major breakthrough pharmacogenetics make possible identify discrete subgroup AUD population accord genetic profile order target subject likely respond treatment particular agent . In addition , genetic variation contribute risk alcohol dependence may differentially associate treatment response Thus successful personalized medicinal approach ensure target subgroup achieve optimal treatment response high predictability . Such approach hold potential identify robust responder treatment also might minimal modest adverse effect putative therapeutic medication . From practical clinical standpoint , personalized medicine approach start genetic screen identify `` right '' subject , treated appropriate medication , high probability positive treatment outcome , therefore , substantial impact public health .</detailed_description>
