	<brief_summary>Sepsis clinical syndrome represent derange hemodynamics ( tachycardia ) secondary severe infection . In high-income country ( HICs ) , early resuscitation septic patient protocol-driven therapy , include quantitative fluid administration guide invasive monitoring , result improved outcome septic patient . Prevalence mortality sepsis think high sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) high-income country ; however , hospital SSA lack technology resource necessary implement resuscitation protocol use HICs therefore , mortality sepsis remain high . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recently disseminate algorithm resuscitation septic patient low resource setting . This algorithm base expert consensus , efficacy never test . This study conduct Casualty Department Moi Teaching Referral Hospital ( MTRH ) Eldoret , Kenya . The purpose study describe epidemiology patient present severe sepsis , examine microbiology cause severe sepsis , describe current management outcome severe sepsis , test effect implementation WHO resuscitation algorithm MTRH . The study design prospective clinical trial . In initial observational phase , adult patient present MTRH Casualty Department sepsis severe sepsis ( latter define elevated lactate ) enrol prospective observational cohort . Demographic data , medical characteristic , microbiological study obtain , management outcome patient observe . In second phase , patient sepsis continue enrol prospective observational cohort , patient severe sepsis enrol intervention group . Patients intervention group manage accord WHO resuscitation algorithm . Specifically , WHO algorithm involve fluid bolus guide vital sign physical exam finding , rapid early administration empiric antibiotic , frequent patient monitoring . The outcomes interest achievement lactate clearance , correlate tissue perfusion , well 24-hour , in-hospital , 30-day mortality .</brief_summary>
