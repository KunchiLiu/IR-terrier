	<detailed_description>The primary objective evaluate effectiveness LPV/r pellets addition AZT/3TC ( ABC/3TC ) paediatric fix dose combination ( FDCs ) tablet routine treatment condition HIV infect infant young child swallow tablet . As secondary objective : - Document safety LPV/r pellets AZT/3TC ABC/3TC - Assess population pharmacokinetics LPV/r NRTIs administer LPV/r pellet plus AZT/3TC ABC/3TC - Measure adherence new formulation - Evaluate child acceptability LPV/r pellet associate dual NRTIs well ease use care giver .</detailed_description>
