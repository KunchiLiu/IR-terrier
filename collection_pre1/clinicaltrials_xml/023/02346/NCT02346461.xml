	<brief_summary>Background : - People GNE myopathy muscle weakness difficulty walk . The disease come gene mutation relate production sugar call sialic acid . Researchers think decrease sialic acid may cause muscle problem . Researchers test drug ManNAc building block sialic acid . It powder dissolved water . Objective : - To evaluate safety 90 day ManNAc give mouth . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 60 diagnosed GNE myopathy . Design : - Eligible participant admit NIH Clinical Center first visit stay 10 14 day . Participants : - Medical history physical exam - Electrocardiogram measure heart function - Blood urine test - Muscle strength test - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) muscle scan . Participants lie table slide metal tube take picture - Questionnaires - Muscle biopsy . Samples muscle take , one arm leg . - The study drug liquid twice day - Participants may wear small activity monitor throughout study . It worn waistband . - After discharge initial visit , participant take study drug home . Participants need record miss dos . - Visit 2 6 week 1 2 day medical evaluation . Blood sample drawn . - Visit 3 end study . Participants stay NIH Clinical Center 5 6 day medical evaluation , muscle test , scan . Another muscle biopsy take . Blood sample drawn . - Participants contact telephone email 4 time leave clinic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Phase 2 Study ManNAc Subjects With GNE Myopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GNE myopathy , previously know hereditary inclusion body myopathy ( HIBM ) , rare , autosomal recessive myopathy onset early adulthood characterize progressive muscle weakness atrophy , lead wheelchair use dependent care . The causative gene , GNE , encode rate-limiting enzyme biosynthesis sialic acid . While exact pathophysiology GNE myopathy remain unknown , decreased sialic acid production subsequent hyposialylation muscle glycoprotein think key factor lead muscle deterioration GNE myopathy . This hypothesis support prevention disease administration N-acetyl-D-mannosamine ( ManNAc ) mouse model GNE myopathy . A recent first-in-human , Phase 1 single ascend dose study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics single dose 3,000 , 6,000 , 10,000 mg drug product-grade ManNAc subject GNE myopathy ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01634750 ; IND No.78,091 ) . ManNAc safe well-tolerated subject participate study . In Phase 2 , open-label , single-center study propose administer ManNAc orally 12 subject 912 day ( 30 month ) . The objective study assess safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics biochemical efficacy orally administer ManNAc GNE myopathy subject evaluate disease-related biomarkers relevant clinical endpoint . In first phase pharmacokinetic assessment , two cohort 6 subject receive ManNAc dose 3,000 mg twice day ( 6,000 mg per day ) 6,000 mg twice day ( 12,000 mg per day ) 7 day admit NIH Clinical Center ass PK safety . Safety tolerability assess individual basis . In second phase study , subject receive treatment ManNAc dose 6,000 mg twice daily remainder study . Follow-up safety efficacy evaluation occur 42 day , 91 ( 3 month ) , 182 ( 6 month ) , 365 ( 12 month ) , 548 ( 18 month ) , 730 ( 24 month ) 912 ( 30 month ) day . Safety lab evaluation perform also 456 ( 15 month ) , 638 ( 21 month ) 820 ( 27 month ) day either NIH clinical center subject home laboratory physician office . Safety evaluate adverse event ( AEs ) , clinical laboratory test , vital sign , physical examination . PK assess plasma ManNAc Neu5Ac . Biochemical efficacy measure change sialylation proteins clinical efficacy assess use battery clinical assessment deem relevant base disease natural history .</detailed_description>
