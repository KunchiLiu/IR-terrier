	<brief_summary>Diabetes Mellitus ( DM ) include several metabolic disease characterize high sugar level blood . Although diabetic nephropathy widespread , underlie pathophysiological mechanism remain poorly understood , far , little progress make prevent development diabetic nephropathy delay kidney function decline . Increasing amount data base animal study support pathogenic role tissue hypoxia development progression diabetic nephropathy . Blood Oxygenation-Level Dependent Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( BOLD-MRI ) increasingly use research measure cortical medullary oxygenation non-invasive manner . Interestingly , two cross-sectional clinical study , recently find positive correlation high circulate blood glucose level cortical R2* level type 2 DM patient . This discovery suggest increase glycemia might acutely decrease renal tissue oxygenation . The goal study investigate impact serum glucose renal tissue oxygenation healthy subject subject glucose intolerance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Acute Hyperglycemia Renal Tissue Oxygenation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therefore , plan recruit 10 healthy subject 10 glucose intolerant patient preserve kidney function perform repetitive BOLD-MRI , administration IV glucose . This allow u study influence hyperglycemia single factor , regardless inflammation , oxidative stress medical treatment , oral hypoglycemic agent and/or insulin , confound factor present DM patient . The main hypothesis project acute hyperglycemia could partially responsible renal tissue hypoxia detect diabetic nephropathy case . In study include 60 participant family history diabetes , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 25 kg / m2 and/or glucose intolerance . Each participant undergo initial glucose tolerance test . In total , select 10 participant impair glucose tolerance 10 healthy subject ( match sex age ) , include control group . Selected subject return third visit CHUV ( V3 ) : start home oral hydration protocol ( load dose 3 ml / kg 8:00 , follow 1 ml / kg every hour 9:00 3:00 pm avoid much possible change kidney perfusion ) . Patients arrive Department Nephrology Hypertension ( CHUV ) 11.00 . In occasion , two catheter place patient 's arm . Later , participant escort Radiology Department undergo four renal oxygenation imaging ( 1:00 pm 2:00 pm ) mean BOLD-MRI technique . During period , patient control subject lie allow stand . At T0 , receive bolus ( 0.75 ml / kg ) glucose 20 % . Subsequently , four BOLD-MRI scan , together blood test , perform T0 , T1 ( +10 min ) , T2 ( +20 min ) , T3 ( +30 min ) . Sodium intake measure 24 hour urinary collection day V3 ( sodium know influence R2* ) .</detailed_description>
