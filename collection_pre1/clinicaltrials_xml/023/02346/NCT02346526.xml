	<brief_title>A Biomarker Study Standard-of-care Radium-223 Chloride Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . This research study design examine treatment strategy standard still relatively new . Ra-223 consist series six infusion give every 4 week . It FDA approve 2013 treatment prostate cancer spread bone grown despite ADT ( `` hormonal therapy '' ) . Ra-223 approve show improve length life men prostate cancer receive . Despite important benefit , know improve standard marker prostate cancer PSA blood test ( blood marker use track cancer activity men prostate cancer ) standard image scan bone scan compute tomography ( CT ) scan . If participant doctor good marker whether cancer respond therapy , hard make decision whether continue therapy . This current problem . This study make use Ra-223 standard FDA-approved way , add non-standard test attempt gain insight drug work best track patient receive drug .</detailed_description>
