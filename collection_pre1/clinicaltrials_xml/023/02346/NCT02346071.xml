	<brief_summary>Background : An increase number adolescent report recurrent functional somatic symptom . Some experience persistent symptom may receive functional somatic syndrome ( FSS ) diagnose ( i.e . symptom attributable know conventionally defined physical disease ) , characterise severe disability reduce quality life . The aim study : 1 . Develop Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) -based group intervention adolescent severe FSS ( conceptualize Bodily Distress Syndrome ( BDS ) , see detailed description ) . 2 . Examine efficacy group base ACT adolescent ( age 15-19 year ) severe FSS . The ACT-based treatment , 9 session group therapy one follow meeting compare standard treatment/enhanced usual care , one single advisory consultation . The study include approximately 120 patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acceptance Commitment Group Therapy Adolescents With Range Functional Somatic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : An increase number adolescent report daily physical symptom , current prevalence 25 % . A substantial proportion young people examine health care system , often conclusion symptom explain term well-defined medical disease hence `` stress-related '' `` functional '' . Typically , symptom remit spontaneously patient reassure . However , approximately 5-10 % experience persistent symptom reduce function . They may receive diagnosis functional somatic syndrome ( FSS ) chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) , fibromyalgia ( FM ) , recurrent abdominal pain/irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) idiopathic pain syndrome . These adolescent risk social isolation , long term school-absence reduce quality life . The aetiology FSS assume complex , interact biological , psychological environmental factor . Recent study suggest dysfunction stress-axes ( e.g . hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis autonomic nervous system ) activate inflammatory response likely play role development perpetuation symptom various FSS . Besides common pathophysiological mechanism , FSS also show similarity patient characteristic treatment response , speak favour common family disorder . Recently , unify diagnostic category Bodily Distress Syndrome ( BDS ) introduce . BDS conceptualize ( patho ) physiologic response prolong severe mental and/or physical stress genetically susceptible individual , diagnosis show encompass majority FSS . FSS adult manage effectively mean psychological treatment , evidence adolescent severe FSS sparse . Family base cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) internet-delivered CBT proven effective young patient particular symptom profile . However , development various specific treatment FSS symptom profile efficient strategy . Recent study suggest adult patient various FSS sample BDS diagnosis feasibly treat together , regardless main somatic complaint . The may true adolescent , hence development common treatment adolescent various FSS BDS may advantageous , facilitate implementation routine clinical care treatment find effective . Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) , derive CBT , show promising result child chronic functional pain . Improvement could demonstrate less avoidance important activity , good emotional wellbeing less health care utilization . The aim project develop ACT-based group intervention adolescent range FSS , i.e . conceptualise severe BDS , evaluate efficacy randomize control trial . Method : Patient population : 120 adolescent BDS refer The Research Clinic Functional Disorders Psychosomatics ( FFL ) , Aarhus University Hospital . Patients refer general practitioner , specialist hospital ward . Diagnostic assessment : BDS diagnose diagnostic work-up physician base : 1 ) review former medical discharge letter , medical record relevant information , 2 ) SCAN ( Schedules Clinical Assessment Neuropsychiatry ) screen general psychopathology contains detailed section BDS 3 ) screening ADHD , autism conduct disorder screen question child adolescent psychiatric interview DAWBA ( Development Well Being Assessment ) , 4 ) physical/neurological examination 5 ) standard blood test . Procedure : Eligible patient , meet study criterion , ask participate RCT . The outcome measure fill baseline ( T0 ) , ( i.e . clinical assessment ) , start therapy ( T1 ) , ( i.e . two month baseline ) , 8 session therapy ( T2 ) , ( i.e . 4 month baseline ) , two week 9 session therapy ( end treatment , T3 ) ( i.e . 5Â½ month baseline ) eight ( T4 ) twelve month ( T5 ) baseline . A physiological assessment stress response inflammatory response perform T0 T5 . Hypotheses : Primary hypothesis : Patients randomize ACT-based group therapy report statistically clinically significant well self-reported physical health twelve month baseline , compare patient receive standard psychiatric consultation ( SPC ) . Secondary hypothesis : Compared control group ( SPC ) , patient receive ACT-group therapy eight twelve month baseline : 1 . Report statistically clinically significant reduction somatic symptom . 2 . Report statistically clinically significant low symptom interference twelve month baseline : 3 . Show significant improvement alteration stress response inflammatory response . The patient receive ACT-group therapy show good feasibility regard treatment .</detailed_description>
