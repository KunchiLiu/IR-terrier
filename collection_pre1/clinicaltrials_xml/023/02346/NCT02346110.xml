	<brief_summary>This study focus optimize postoperative pain treatment major foot ankle surgery prolong duration ultrasound-guided saphenous block . The currently use single shot saphenous block cover half pain intensive period saphenous territory , result sharp , break-through pain require opioids . The hypothesis protract mixture keep patient free pain without use opioids entire pain intensive period thus increase rehabilitation patient ' satisfaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protracted Effect Ultrasound-guided Saphenous Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Half patient receive single shot saphenous block 10 mL bupivacaine-adrenalin 1 mL sodium chloride solution , half receive 10 mL bupivacaine-adrenalin 1 mL dexamethasone . The block strictly sensory block selective , sub-sartorial saphenous block mid-thigh level without anesthetic effect femoral nerve . The adjuvant dexamethasone increasingly become subject interest regarding protract effect , show several study . However , precise mechanism action remain speculative , result contradictory regard discussion whether effect systemic local . The effect may stem decreased nociceptive C-fibre activity via direct action glucocorticoid receptor inhibitory potassium channel . Another suggestion vasoconstrictive effect , reduce systemic uptake local anaesthetic systemic anti-inflammatory effect . Prolonging effect single shot saphenous block add dexamethasone reduce need opioids , reduce risk adverse effect like nausea , vomit respiratory depression . Furthermore , new study show inadequate pain alleviation early postoperative period risk factor develop chronic persistent pain .</detailed_description>
