	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2 Study High-dose Genetically Targeted Enzyme Replacement Therapy Advanced Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) disable chronic disease frequent discharge diagnosis hospitalization among old adults.The American Heart Association ( AHA ) 2006 update heart disease report 5 million Americans believe symptomatic HF , 550,000 patient newly diagnose year . The estimated direct indirect cost HF United States ( U.S. ) 2006 ~ $ 29.6 billion . Despite significant resource expend treatment disease , outcomes remain poor . The five-year survival individual diagnose HF le 50 % , end-stage HF , one-year survival may low 25 % regardless medical therapy . Recent study suggest fail heart refractory treatment , previously believe . For example , observation small percentage subject leave ventricular assist device permanently wean device strongly suggest damage heart capable recover lose function . Celladon Corporation ( Celladon ) investigate gene transfer method restore calcium ion ( Ca++ ) cycle HF patient . The gene therapy vehicle use recombinant adeno-associated viral vector ( AAV ) , consist AAV serotype 1 capsid contains human sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca++ ATPAse ( SERCA2a ) complementary DNA ( cDNA ) flank inverted terminal repeat derive AAV serotype 2 ( AAV1/SERCA2a ) . MYDICAR® refers AAV1/SERCA2a drug product intend administration percutaneous delivery . Phase 1/2 clinical trial demonstrate initial safety evidence improvement clinical outcome MYDICAR dose 1 x 10^13 DNase-resistant particle ( DRP ) . The trial describe design investigate safety profile preliminary activity MYDICAR dose 2.5 x 10^13 DRP ; dose 2.5-fold high previously investigate dos .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Unless otherwise specify , screen must perform within 30 day prior enrollment ( phase 1 ) enrollment/randomization ( phase 2 ) except note . Subjects must meet follow criterion eligible study : 1 . AAV1 neutralize antibody ( NAb ) negative ( titer &lt; 1:2 equivocal ) within 60 day prior screen . 2 . Age 1880 year , inclusive , time sign first inform consent . 3 . Chronic ischemic nonischemic cardiomyopathy , except hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . Toxic alcoholic cardiomyopathy allow long toxin alcohol exposure eliminate sufficient amount time elapse rule spontaneous recovery . Similarly , patient viral peripartum cardiomyopathy enrol sufficient time elapse rule spontaneous recovery . Subjects ischemic cardiomyopathy must least 1 major coronary vessel thrombolysis myocardial infarction ( TIMI ) grade 3 flow . ( If subject undergone recent coronary angiography , TIMI flow may assess study angiography prior investigational medicinal product [ IMP ] infusion ) . 4 . Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35 % . 5 . Diagnosis New York Heart Association class III/IV heart failure ( HF ) minimum 60 day prior screen . 6 . For phase 2 , presence least one follow risk factor : 1 . Hospitalization HF within 6 month screen , lieu hospitalization , least 2 outpatient intervention intend treatment sign symptom worsen HF ( e.g. , intravenous [ IV ] diuretic , peripheral ultrafiltration ) . 2 . Nterminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide ( NTproBNP ) &gt; 1200 pg/mL within 30 day screen ; subject atrial fibrillation , NTproBNP &gt; 1600 pg/mL within 30 day screen . 7 . Individualized , maximal , optimized HF therapy consistent American College Cardiology/American Heart Association practice guideline treatment chronic heart failure ( ACC/AHA HF guideline ) update time time : 1 . Medical therapy , appropriate individual subject , include oral diuretic , angiotensinconverting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , ACE intolerant , angiotensinreceptor blocker beta blocker approve dosage label respective package insert optimize subject . The choice beta blocker limit approve HF ( bisoprolol , carvedilol metoprolol succinate ) . Metoprolol tartrate approve HF allow . Unless contraindicate tolerate , addition aldosterone antagonist consider absence hyperkalemia significant renal dysfunction accord evolving standard . However , final decision discretion investigator . Dosing medication must stable minimum 30 day prior screen , although downtitration diuretic , medically indicate , permit . Patients require IV diuretic period require undergo additional 30 day period stabilization oral diuretic . Enrollment subject deviation criterion must preapproved medical monitor . 2 . Resynchronization therapy , clinically indicate accord ACC/AHA HF guideline , must initiate least 6 month prior screen . 3 . If subject already participate cardiac rehabilitation program , consistent current clinical practice guideline continue least 12Month Active Observation Period . This imply potential candidate must enrol cardiac rehabilitation program screening future . 8 . Implantable cardioverter defibrillator require must implant minimum 30 day prior screen . 9 . All male subject regardless fertility status fertility status partner must agree use condom spermicide sexual relation 6 month follow IMP administration protect partner potential viral shed . 10 . All subject regardless fertility status fertility status partner must agree male partner use condom spermicide sexual relation 6 month follow IMP administration protect partner potential viral shed . 11 . All subject capable procreation partner must agree use adequate contraception 6 month follow IMP administration avoid pregnancy ( defined oral injectable contraceptive , intrauterine device , surgical sterilization addition to/or combination condom spermicide ) . 12 . Agree donate sperm oocytes 6 month follow IMP administration . 13 . Ability sign Informed Consent Form Release Medical Information Form . Subjects meet follow criterion exclude study : 1 . De novo diagnosis heart failure . 2 . Any IV therapy positive inotropes , vasodilator diuretic within 30 day prior screen enrollment . 3 . Restrictive cardiomyopathy , obstructive cardiomyopathy , acute myocarditis , pericardial disease , amyloidosis , infiltrative cardiomyopathy , uncorrected thyroid disease discrete leave ventricular aneurysm . 4 .

Myocardial infarction ( e.g. , ST elevation myocardial infarction [ STEMI ] large nonSTEMI ) within 90 day prior screen . Large nonSTEMI shall define &gt; 3x upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine kinase test &gt; 5x ULN troponin . 6 . Prior heart transplantation , leave ventricular reduction surgery ( LVRS ) , cardiomyoplasty , passive restraint device ( e.g. , CorCap™ Cardiac Support Device ) , mechanical circulatory support device ( MCSD ) cardiac shunt . 7 . Likely receive cardiac resynchronization therapy , cardiomyoplasty , LVRS , conventional revascularization procedure valvular repair 6 month follow treatment . 8 . Likely need immediate heart transplant MCSD implant due hemodynamic instability . 9 . Prior coronary artery bypass graft ( ) necessarily exclusionary . A potential candidate review casebycase basis treat interventionist , take account dominance system , accessibility graft ( ) orifice , contribution graft vessel ( ) native coronary artery viable myocardial perfusion . The case tentative infusion strategy must discuss medical safety officer prior enrollment subject study . 10 . Known hypersensitivity radiopaque agent use angiography ; history likely need , high dose corticosteroid pretreatment prior contrast angiography . 11 .
