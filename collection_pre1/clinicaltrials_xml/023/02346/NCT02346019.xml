	<brief_title>Thigh Reduction Surgery Above Knee Amputee Residual Limbs Improve Prosthesis Fit Patient Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We quantify anatomical distribution subcutaneous fat , muscle bone residual limb transfemoral amputee MRI . We measure displacement socket wall relative femur mechanical load x-ray . The functional mobility level subject quantify via standard clinical bio mechanical test . Perform standard medial thighplasty without thigh liposuction . Characterize post-surgical anatomy , compliance residual limb function amputee subject . After six month , repeat MRI xray compare result . Subject also complete questionnaire regard view outcome surgery .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Obese transfemoral amputee BMI least 30 . Mid long residual limb , excessive adipose tissue residual limb Community ambulators Adults age 18 Amputation due vascular disease diabetes Cognitive impairment would interfere protocol patient safety Systemic disease stable would significantly increase risk complication surgery Chronic wound People ambulate daily basis Children age 18 .</criteria>
