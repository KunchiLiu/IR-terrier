	<brief_summary>A . Hypertension major cardiovascular risk factor numerous treatment strategy develop treat hypertension properly reduce cardiovascular risk . B . However , subgroup hypertension resistant treatment . 1 . Resistant hypertension associate sympathetic hyperactivity 2 . Renal sympathetic nerve know associated systemic sympathetic activity 3 . According research recent year , catheter base renal sympathetic denervation safe effective treatment modality treat resistant hypertension C. Resistant hypertension observe end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) frequently . D. Sympathetic hyperactivity observe ESRD patient E. Catheter base renal sympathetic denervation expect improve resistant hypertension ESRD patient F. The aim present study evaluate effect safety catheter base renal sympathetic denervation resistant hypertension ESRD</brief_summary>
