	<brief_title>Combining Robotic-Assisted Therapy Pharmacotherapy Post-Stroke Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every year , approximately 795,000 people suffer new recurrent stroke United States , mean every 40 second someone stroke . In United States , stroke third frequent cause death lead cause lasting hemiparesis adult disability . Since prevalence stroke increase age , since world population age , incidence stroke expect rise come year . This become significant societal burden since care stroke survivor costly , individual society . Post-stroke upper extremity ( UE ) impairment usually imply initial weakness , subsequent diminish dexterity limitation incapacity reaching , transport grasp movement since onset . Survivors may regain partial , less often , complete muscle strength affect UE recovery process . However , persistent degree weakness evolution secondary complication spasticity ( characterize increase flexor hypertonia ) , shoulder pain contracture frequent . These additional issue associate great impairment , bad function lower health-related quality life . Treatment intervention hemiparesis stroke usually include stretch , strengthen antagonist muscle , splint , oral medication , focal injection ( phenol botulinum toxin ) intrathecal baclofen . However , amount , intensity length therapy still need investigation . Despite adequate traditional treatment , high number patient still permanently limited consequence stroke . Based motor learn theory , recent study demonstrate intensive , repetitive , task-oriented therapy help paretic extremity `` relearn '' perform movement lose brain damage . ROBOTIC-ASSISTED UPPER-LIMB TRAINING WITH ARMEO® Current evidence show rehabilitation without specific train result measurable outcome . Factors intensity specificity motor training important achieve recovery motor function , especially chronic phase stroke . There robust evidence highly-repetitive movement rehabilitation could improve motor functional ability , base role motor learn processes.Robotic device become important area research capacity achieve high-intensity specificity therapy . In proposed project , plan use Armeo robotic system deliver motor training therapy . The Armeo system adjustable arm orthosis receive FDA 510k exemption . It passively counterbalance weight arm , thereby reduce effort require paretic arm overcome gravity . The device able augment feedback virtual environment ( i.e . computer game ) . The task present virtual environment design achieve functional movement , i.e . subject perform task reach object part game . Gravity compensation , reduce level difficulty perform activity , facilitate active arm movement , especially involve train grasp reach . By use Armeo system , hope achieve repetitive training reach , grasp , release engage environment adapt individual capability . We also expect enable stroke survivor whose motor weakness may exclude perform repetitive therapy task participate study . LEVODOPA Several agent widely prove influence neuronal plasticity . Among agent , pharmacological drug increase availability Central Nervous System ( CNS ) neurotransmitter ( dopamine , norepinephrine , serotonin , acetylcholine hista mine ) show ability modulate excitability cortical neuron exert subsequent facilitator effect neuroplasticity . In regard , several study conduct past two decade investigating , among agent , effect amphetamine , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , donepezil , psychostimulants methylphenidate dopaminergic agent . Levodopa ( LD ) desirable drug evaluate safe action profile . This oral medication precursor dopamine ( DA ) actively transport across blood-brain barrier convert DA CNS peripheral tissue . Approximately 95 % LD convert DA , stimulate dopaminergic neurotransmission , remain 5 % convert norepinephrine affect adrenergic neurotransmission . DA play role formation motor memory thereby facilitate neuroplasticity , strengthen ( long term potentiation , LTP ) weakening ( long term depression , LTD ) neuronal synapsis , thereby generate neuroplasticity . DA invert U-shape concentration curve effect facilitate LTP . In previous study dose 100mg generated facilitator effect , 25 mg 200 mg exert inhibitor effect human cortex . This pharmacological agent show promising result treatment stroke enhance functional motor recovery sub-acute chronic period , combination intensive physical therapy , without report significant side effect . In acute sub-acute phase , LD demonstrate improve functional motor skill maintain three week follow . LD also show additional benefit activity daily live severity stroke . In chronic period , single dose LD combine physical therapy five week enhance formation training-dependent elementary motor memory improve UE dexterity . COMBINING LEVODOPA/CARBIDOPA WITH THE ARMEO SYSTEM It hypothesis intake levodopa/carbidopa LD/CD combination intensive robotic-assisted therapy provide good outcome functional recovery test train alone . We also hypothesize improvement could correlate change motor cortex excitability . Current strategy improve motor recovery stroke focus neuroplasticity neuromodulation . There grow interest combination therapy strategies enhance plasticity thereby functional recovery rehabilitation process . It frequently hypothesize combination drug therapy physical rehabilitation could provide good outcome enhance neuroplasticity phenomenon We propose randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study LD/CD combination repetitive upper-extremity functional task-oriented robotic-aided training .</detailed_description>
