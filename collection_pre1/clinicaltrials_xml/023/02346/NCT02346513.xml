	<detailed_description>Peri-prosthetic osteolysis associate aseptic loosening total hip replacement ( THR ) . It understand biological response wear particle , polyethylene debris think major cause long-term failure . With total hip replacement ( THR ) patient young , active young , anticipate much great longevity , reduce bearing wear become increasingly important . Compared wear osteolysis incidence metal-polyethylene bearing , historical result alternate bearing metal-on-metal ( MOM ) ceramic-on-ceramic ( COC ) generally show much low wear rate osteolysis seemingly quite rare . The laboratory wear-rates metal-metal bearing generally fall range 1-7 mm3/million cycle ( Mc ) 0.1-1 mm3/Mc run-in steady-state phase , respectively . Ceramic-on-ceramic metal-on-metal bearing surface often employ total hip replacement resistance wear . Alternative bearing surface ceramic-on-ceramic metal-on-metal eliminate polyethylene wear . Explanted metal-on-metal articulation make cobalt-chromium-molybdenum ( Co-Cr-Mo ) alloy show extremely low rate linear wear , ceramic-on-ceramic bearing even less . A ceramic-on-ceramic articulation first implanted 1970 France . Long-term report show excellent clinical result . Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing advantage low wear high biocompatibility . Alumina-ceramic particle essentially insoluble organic medium ionisation therefore unimportant . However , limit : brittleness major concern ceramic , could lead clinically relevant failure rate ( 0.004 % head fracture 0.22 % liner fracture . Although Metal-on-metal ( MOM ) articulation see one potential solution problem associate UHMWPE-induced osteolysis , metal ion present serum potential toxic effect locally systemically cause concern . A low wear rate believe critical extending implant life prosthetic joint , wear volume produce MOM articulation estimate 40-100 time low metal-on-polyethylene bearing . The wear MOM prosthesis know highly dependent upon material , tribological design finishing technique . Clinical study retrieve first second-generation MOM hip prostheses show linear penetration approximately 5 Î¼m/year . This equivalent wear volume approximately 1 mm3/year , two order magnitude low conventional polyethylene acetabular cup . The observation small number patient first-generation MOM prosthesis exhibit good clinical radiographical result 20 year vivo lead development second-generation MOM hip prosthesis , 1988 Metasul prosthesis introduce clinical practice . This comprised cobalt chrome alloy femoral head articulate cobalt chrome alloy acetabular cup . Over 200,000 Metasul combination implant date . Short-term clinical performance encouraging ; low wear rate , prosthesis require revision . However , long-term clinical performance yet unknown . Although MOM hip prostheses produce significantly low wear rate conventional UHMWPE-on-metal couple , low wear rate highly crosslinked UHMWPE-on-metal hip prosthesis , concern associate bearing . Wear particle report nanometer size range , order magnitude small UHMWPE particle . Therefore , despite low wear volume UHMWPE bearing number particle produce estimate great , possibly one ten million particle per step . These small particle potential distribute throughout body via lymphatic system , particles find lymph node , liver , spleen bone marrow . As MOM hip prosthesis indicate young active patient particle present site long period time , possibly 30-40 year . Concern express biological response metal particle release metal-on-metal coupling . The level cobalt chromium ion measure blood serum patient successful THR , information possible release aluminum ceramic-on-ceramic articulation lack . A good understanding influence metallurgy tribology wear component improve manufacturing technology allow re-introduction metal-on-metal articulation total hip replacement . Excellent early clinical outcome report new generation metal-on-metal component . Retrieval study previous metal-on-metal bearing contemporary implant show low rate wear . These hard bearing surface especially promise young active patient . Although metal-on-metal bearing produce significantly less wear debris metal-on-polyethylene bearing surface , debris generate result body expose metal ion prolong period . Concerns exist metal hypersensitivity , osteolysis , chromosomal mutation , carcinogenicity fetal exposure high ion level . These matter require investigation , particularly long-term exposure young patient recognition patient may unusually high ion level . From tribological study , joint simulation test clinical trial , propose extent wear reduce use component large diameter high carbon content alloy ( 0.2 % ) , well-adjusted clearance component , good implant sphericity lower surface roughness . Whilst research show high concentration nanometre-sized metal wear particle cytotoxic human fibroblast macrophage vitro , also concern release metal ion small particle , potential effect ion cell tissue . Elevated ion concentration report blood urine patient metallic implant component . In addition , contrary might expect , conclusive evidence ion level fall vivo bedding period MOM prosthesis , wear prostheses high . Cobalt chromium ion high toxicity , real concern effect sub-lethal dos metal ion , show cause DNA damage . This damage take form chromosome aberration chromosome translocation . Over long period exposure worry lead development certain type cancer , leukaemia lymphoma . In animal model elevate level cobalt , chromium nickel correlate increased carcinoma rate . However , report literature malignancy develop total hip knee replacement surgery exceedingly rare . Out eight epidemiological study relative risk cancer TJR , one study look specifically MOM implant . This study find increase risk cancer development subject receive MOM hip prosthesis compare receive metal-on-polyethylene hip prosthesis . However , study date substantially underpowered term patient number require show difference two prosthesis type . High level cobalt chromium ion detect blood urine patient metal-on-metal ( MOM ) hip replacement despite , even element release result wear bearing surface . The clinical effect elevate metal ion level include local tissue reaction , characterize increase T B cell tissue surround hip , associate premature failure hip . Systemically , one report suggest reduced number CD8-positive T cell . Metal sensitivity also potential problem . Metal ion , whether produce secondary wear debris via corrosion initiate hypersensitivity response . A delayed cell-mediated response , delayed-type hypersensitivity response occur , cytokine release T-lymphocytes increased activation macrophage see , may result T-cell mediated periprosthetic osteolysis . Many metal initiate hypersensitivity response , common nickel follow cobalt chromium . Therefore , well-documented elevation cobalt chromium ion patient MOM hip implant , theoretical risk develop hypersensitivity reaction . Recently , immune response exclusively associate second-generation MOM hip prosthesis , describe . Histomorphological change suggest type hypersensitivity reaction all-metallic implant . The hypersensitivity hypothesis strengthen observation patient experience early clinical failure 11-60 month ( mean 29 month ) , fact patient receive second MOM prosthesis experience relief symptom . Conversely , patient receive either metal-on-polyethylene ceramic-on-polyethylene couple report symptom completely disappear . In control group patient joint prosthesis contain cobalt , chromium nickel sign immunological reaction absent . Reports type reaction become increasingly common ; however , research need area . It know whether patient experience prosthesis failure pre-existing metal sensitivity , whether metal sensitivity develop high wear bearing elevate metal ion level . Theoretically , would increase probability develop hypersensitivity elevate metal ion level , hence increase risk implant failure . To reduce effect limitation , breakage ceramic insert COM bearing reduce ion release MOM bear hybrid couple ceramic-on-metal propose . The theoretical advantage new couple might lead orthopedic surgeon use indiscriminately .</detailed_description>
