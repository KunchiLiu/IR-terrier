	<brief_summary>The purpose study confirm analgesic effect tDCS neuropathic chronic pain , estimate importance duration effect , improve efficiency use home . It establish repetition session cortical stimulation week improve analgesic efficacy . However , effect exceed week much low stimulation implant surgically . Implanted stimulation operate periodically , several time day , `` repetition dose `` , akin regular take medicine , may explain long efficacy pain relief , may extend several year ( André-Obadia al 2014 ) . No study date estimate long-term effect non-invasive stimulation also periodically repeat daily basis , several week .</brief_summary>
