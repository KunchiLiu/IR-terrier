	<brief_summary>A Phase 1b study subject Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC participate 1 2 portion study . The first portion Dose Escalation subject test PEGPH20 various dos ( 1.6 , 3.0 , 2.2 2.8 mcg/kg ) addition dose standard dose docetaxel 75 mg/m2 ( PDoc ) every 21-day cycle . Based observation safety tolerability study treatment dose escalation cohort dose date ( 1.6 3.0 mcg/kg PEGPH20 ) , two additional dose level test , 2.2 2.8 mcg/kg . Up 30 additional subject may enrol test dose level . The second portion Phase 1b Cohort Expansion recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) PDoc identify dose escalation administer every 21 day approximately 50 subject high hyaluronan ( HA-high ) prospectively measure tumor tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 1b study subject Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC participate 1 2 portion study . The first portion Phase 1b Dose Escalation enroll 30 subject test various dose level PEGPH20 ( 1.6 , 2.2 , 2.8 3.0 mcg/kg ) plus docetaxel 75mg/m2 every 3 week maximum tolerate dose MTD found . Based observation safety tolerability study treatment dose escalation cohort dose date ( 1.6 3.0 mcg/kg PEGPH20 ) , two additional dose level , 2.2 2.8 mcg/kg test . The 2nd portion Phase 1b Cohort Expansion . This portion enroll approximately 50 subject MTD/RP2D PDoc give every 21-day cycle . These subject pre-selected high level HA measure tumor tissue sample prior enrollment . After Phase 1b complete , data analyze safe , best tolerate efficacious dose PDoc use plan separate Phase 2 study .</detailed_description>
