	<brief_title>The Baby CHAMP Study ( Children With Hemiparesis Arm Movement Project )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2013 , systematic review intervention child cerebral palsy ( Novak et al , 2013 ) conclude constraint-induced movement therapy ( CIMT ) produce large magnitude effect non-surgical treatment . Similarly , first major handbook summarize result 50 study CIMT conduct worldwide ( Ramey , Coker-Bolt , &amp; DeLuca , 2013 ) provide additional clinical scientific support conclusion CIMT produce significant benefit . There number important unresolved issue . One concern need empirical evidence CIMT efficacious infant toddler , since randomize control trial ( RCT ) focus age range . Another issue debate whether different effect relate type constraint use therapy . The constraint place child 's `` strong '' non-hemiparetic upper extremity therapy focus improve child 's skill use impaired hemiparetic upper extremity . Two widely use form constraint : 1 ) full-arm cast child wear continuously throughout multi-week period child receive daily therapy 2 ) part-arm splint child wear time day receive therapy . Finally , another important topic study whether CIMT stressful form therapy , high-intensity ( i.e. , much high dosage usual customary session form occupational physical therapy ) , involve constrain child 's non-involved le involve upper extremity , take place child 's home often ask parent help practice session non-therapy hour . If CIMT produce elevated stress child , parent , , stress short-term ( i.e. , start therapy ) continue entire period therapy ? Further , type constraint use produce different level stress , either first throughout course therapy ? The propose study randomize control trial ( RCT ) CIMT 72 child hemiparetic spastic cerebral palsy ( CP ) age 6 24 month . The study take place two site ( Roanoke , VA Columbus , OH ) , site enrol 36 child 3 year period . The study address two specific aim : Aim 1 : test efficacy 3 different constraint condition use part administer standardized form therapy know ACQUIRE ( DeLuca , Echols , &amp; Ramey , 2007 ) . The 3 constraint condition : ) continuous constraint , ii ) part-time constraint , iii ) constraint . In 3 group , child receive 3 hour therapy per day 5 day per week 4 consecutive day . Therapy deliver licensed occupation physical therapist train deliver ACQUIRE therapy high fidelity . In addition , parent train provide one hour practice home , use technique compatible used ACQUIRE therapist . Efficacy measure primarily change child 's assess skill level use upper extremity , hemiparetic ( affect ) non-hemiparetic ( less involve ) upper extremity , use alone together ( i.e. , complete bimanual task ) . In addition , change brain functioning related receive 3 different constraint condition measure use functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) , non-invasive safe procedure permit child active record take place . Aim 2 : monitor stress level safety risk relate use constraint 3 condition identify ( Aim 1 ) . The study address stress level child parent , CIMT high-intensity unusual ( i.e. , constrain child 's `` strong arm '' ) form therapy take place child 's home . Prior publish clinical case report indicate infant toddler adjust well form therapy , parent favorable response , study previously directly measure stress effect , relate self-report parent biological indicator , reveal collect saliva hair sample analyze cortisol level change time . The study result expect important inform field infant rehabilitation provide much-needed evidence whether infant toddler show significant ( clinically meaningful ) benefit one 3 form therapy test . The finding include evidence behavioral brain change . Further , evidence answer question whether immediate therapy benefit , detect , continue measurable 6 12 month therapy end . In addition , study yield first-ever evidence whether CIMT stressful child parent . It may child parent high risk show stress effect . If , data generate study important future clinical practice research reduce level . If elevated stress occur , markedly lower stress detect , finding help resolve uncertainty currently prevent family clinician consider form therapy , despite fact scientific study show produce large last benefit child age 2 older .</detailed_description>
