	<detailed_description>Introduction Increasingly physical inactive lifestyle western world lead increase life style relate disease . The consequence already present childhood increase prevalence overweight , obesity diabetes . Inactivity also accompany cardiovascular disease also think associate increased incidence near sightedness ( myopia ) . Myopia world 's occur eye disease , usually cause increase length growth eye . Myopia lead great personal societal cost addition also lead secondary eye disorder retinal detachment , glaucoma cataract . The growth eye length principally develop mid-childhood , witch year witch valuable investigate underlying factor development myopia . The prevalence myopia increase significantly recent decade , without know cause . Particularly Asia , high dramatically increase prevalence myopia - urbanized area 80-90 % among child final year primary school people . Myopia cause combination genetic environmental factor . Lifestyle change reduce physical activity close-up work think great importance.4 Conversely , also evidence possible protective effect outdoor presence development myopia . We kwow protective effect due total time spend outdoors per se increase physical activity , although small study describe slower development low degree myopia child use time outdoor activity sport child control group . In addition Danish study college student ( physical education student -vs. medical student ) find association physical activity , student activity myopia suggest preventive effect physical activity less intense study activity development progression myopia . It still unclear whether physical activity prevent development myopia - realization could far-reaching consequence form modify approach necessity exercise consequent significant socio-economic benefit . The retina place human body possible directly inspect microvasculature . Photography eye background ( fundus photography ) non-invasive examination retinal structure possible make measurement retinal blood vessel . Semi automate measurement retinal vascular diameter simple validated method examine retinal system . Several large study show correlation retinal vessel diameter systemic disease hypertension , stroke cardiovascular disease adult . Furthermore , study also demonstrate retinal vascular change child comparable change adult , include thin retinal artery child hypertension . Blood pressure level significantly increase among child adolescent last ten year , related increase obesity . There also correlation physically inactive lifestyle obesity . High blood pressure child adolescence lead increase risk cardiovascular disease risk later life , include development early atherosclerosis . There still miss considerable knowledge correlation physical activity retinal vascular diameter child . By able identify retinal vessel diameter risk factor marker later development cardiovascular disease , possible early stage identify child benefit targeted preventional effort . Using unique child cohort want investigate correlation physical activity , myopia retinal vascular diameter large group Danish schoolchildren . We study degree reversibility physical activity effect development myopia retinal vasculopathy . The study - material The current study new subproject The Childhood Health , Activity , Motor Performance School ( CHAMPS ) Study Denmark . CHAMPS-DK aims investigate effect increase physical activity current future health child adolescent . In 2007 , city council Svendborg take decision provide increase level suitable physical activity primary school , aim improve physical health child . Before start Svendborg Project , 19 primary school Svendborg invite , six choose participate . A committee consist school principal physical education teacher school make proposal base Team Denmark training concept child . The project well-defined cohort originally 1515 school student since 2007 divide two group : 775 six school extra exercise school hour 750 six match traditional school . The six sport school introduce 6 hour sport per week versus normal hour sport 2 hour week . Students far follow six year researcher Hans Christian Andersen Children 's Hospital , University Hospital Centre Research Childhood Health ( RICH ) , SDU study effect physical activity lifestyle disease , back problem , sport injury , etc . Students - initially age 6 10 year - follow studied variety area . At baseline make survey , demographic data collect , objective test , physical biological test , include DEXA scan blood test . In addition , visual data student healthcare study school start note , possible determine myopic time . Each week throughout study period , student parent answer text message question student 's leisure- sport activity , duration type , whether problem encounter musculoskeletal system . In addition , twice year , data health habit , physical objective measure , balance , endurance capacity , bone status , lifestyle disease , injury musculoskeletal problem collect . For period student equip accelerometer - device objectively measure amount degree physical activity . With data collection weekly SMS update continuous measurement accelerometer , possible time know student 's precise level exercise detail knowledge student 's physical form.18 , Purpose The project serve investigate effect physical activity 1 ) development myopia 2 ) retinal vascular geometry , include whether latter use marker cardiovascular risk child . With project , also strive promote research cooperation across department Odense University Hospital Research Unit Ophthalmology , Institute Clinical Research RICH . Hypothesis We expect physical activity protective effect myopia well retinal vasculopathy make follow hypothesis : 1 . Physical activity - especially outdoor activity - associate less myopia child school age 2 . Physical activity associate optimal retinal vascular diameter therefore favourable cardiovascular risk profile . Method 1 . The study conduct cross-sectional study aim associate current level physical activity ( assess self-report accelerometer ) 1 ) degree myopia 2 ) retinal vascular diameter . 2 . The study also follow-up baseline data collect cohort school start , school nurse measurement ( later reference practice ophthalmologist ) possible identify student already myopic . This make possible create longitudinal assessment degree myopia study . Data collection In spring 2015 , 700 enrolled student ( currently 7th-10th grade ) CHAMPS study call examination Odense University Hospital , follow data collect : Non ophthalmological data : Age , sex , weight , height , cardiovascular risk factor ( lipid status , DEXA scan , vitamin D ) , physical status outdoor level ( assessed type school , SMS report accelerometer ) . Ophthalmological data : Visus ( ETDRS ) , autorefraction cycloplegia , refractional status ( axis length , k-number ) , tonometry , fundus photography ( vascular diameter ) spectral-domain optical koherens tomography ( SD-OCT ) . Analysis data processing In study retinal photograph OCT record fundus camera ( Topcon 3D OCT , Tokyo , Japan ) . To measure analyse retinal vessel semi-automated computer program ( IVAN ) use . It give numerous information calculate diameter arterioles venule . Power calculation The study fix cohort 700 student . In order ensure enough power investigate anticipated correlation , follow power calculation make ( SigmaPlot , version 12 , Systat Software Inc. , San Jose , California , United States ) . Visus : Requires inclusion least 64 student order detect difference 5 ETDRS letter follow assumption : normal distribution , statistical power : 80 % significance level ( α ) : 5 % , standard deviation ( SD ) : 10 ETDRS letter . Refraction : Requires inclusion least 194 student detect difference 0.50 diopter ( power : 80 % , α = 5 % , SD = 1.75D ) . Arteriolar vascular diameter : Requires inclusion least 125 student detect change 5 micron ( power : 80 % , α : 5 % , SD = 14 micron ) . Overall cohort meet requirement . Perspectives The study may later form basis follow-up study present investigation may constitute baseline data longitudinal study investigate 1 ) role physical activity final development myopia cohort 2 ) correlation retinal vascular diameter status later development cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
