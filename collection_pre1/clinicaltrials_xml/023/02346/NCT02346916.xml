	<detailed_description>Chest discomfort consider hallmark myocardial ischemia important clinical warning sign myocardial infarction ( MI ) . The ability sense ischemic chest discomfort appear impaired substantial minority population individual presumably increase risk unrecognized MI . While mechanism ( ) responsible perception chest pain associate myocardial ischemia still fully understood , study suggest transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 ( TRPV1 ) play key role process . This nociceptor , know mediate pain sensation skin elsewhere peripheral nervous system , also find outer surface heart show respond ischemic stress organ . The purpose study determine whether positive correlation ability sense chest pain context myocardial ischemia ability sense discomfort associate topical application TRPV1 agonist capsaicin ( active ingredient hot chili pepper ) . Patients undergoing urgent emergent balloon angioplasty acute coronary stenosis ask quantify subjective intensity chest pain feel standardize episode myocardial ischemia produce one-minute coronary balloon occlusion , use previously-validated numeric rating scale . The patient subsequently ask grade subjective intensity cutaneous discomfort result application capsaicin-containing patch ( Capzasin-HP Cream , over-the-counter product approve topical application treat muscle joint ache ) forearm . The goal determine whether association demonstrate subjective perception ischemic chest pain coronary balloon occlusion cutaneous capsaicin sensitivity . Such association could considerable clinical value , might allow physician prospectively assess individual 's ability perceive myocardial ischemia/infarction assess his/her subjective response topical application capsaicin . This study design companion project Project 1029 Chest Pain Perception Capsaicin Sensitivity , collect data clinically stable patient undergo elective cardiac catheterization .</detailed_description>
