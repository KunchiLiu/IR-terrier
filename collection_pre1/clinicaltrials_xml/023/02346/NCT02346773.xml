	<brief_summary>Currently , considerable interest possibility dietary supplementation fatty acid , mostly omega-3 fatty acid , potential benefit brain development . Epidemiological clinical study support idea relative disappearance omega-3 diet diet developed country link increase physical mental disorder . Omega-3 deficiency may lead cognitive impairment , motor dysfunction visual acuity problem . It known family low socioeconomic status may poorer diet , consequently , may realize full potential regard cognitive ability . The aim project evaluate effectiveness diet intervention rich omega-3 acid healthy child 9-to-12 year old less well-off family .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Omega-3 Fatty Acids Supplementation Brain Behaviour Healthy Children .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background It establish safe environment , adequate stimulation , parental care play major role brain development . An adequate diet also critically important brain development grow child . It suggest omega-3 fatty acid essential human health well cognitive development . Omega-3 acid important prenatal human brain development , especially synaptogenesis . Levels omega-3 amino acid prenatal early postnatal ( breastfeed ) period depend level maternal circulation . Later , omega-3 must present child 's diet . It seem omega-3 deficiency may associate impaired visual acuity , cognition , cerebellar dysfunction neurological disorder ( Haag , 2003 ; Review ) . Thus , omega-3 supplementation may beneficial child poor diet , often associate low socioeconomic level ( Northstone et al . 2008 ) . Aims Design We assess effect Omega-3 supplementation brain behaviour 40 healthy child 9-to-12 year old . Since diet supplementation may beneficial particular child poor diet , recruit child less well-off neighbourhood , determine Index Multiple Deprivation 2007 . Our aim examine difference cognitive performance pre post diet supplementation . The brain structure assess use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Cognitive ability well behavioural problem assess use comprehensive battery test questionnaire . To evaluate effectiveness supplementation , collect blood sample investigate fatty acid level blood . The assessment carry twice : 3-month dietary intervention . The dietary intervention include daily use , period three month , margarine enrich ( Experimental group ) ( placebo group ) Omega-3 fatty acid . We hypothesize intervention improve cognitive deficit ( attention , process speed ) behavioural symptom ( e.g . depression , aggressiveness , impulsivity ) together impact brain structure ( e.g . white-matter property relate myelination ) . Experimental Protocol Each participant participate two phase : clinical assessment phase ( assure exclusion inclusion criterion ) experimental phase . The experimental phase consist baseline ( pre-intervention ) assessment , diet intervention ( 3 month ) post-intervention assessment . At baseline , group ( enrich diet placebo ) underwent cognitive assessment MRI . Parents ask complete questionnaire child 's behaviour demographical data number child , education etc . Children also ask provide blood sample , take fully train licensed team member . After baseline assessment , experimental group ( n=20 ) control group ( n=20 ) follow diet supplementation omega-3 fatty acid placebo diet respectively . The intervention last three month test re-administered group ( case control ) . Parents also ask complete brief questionnaire measure child 's behaviour .</detailed_description>
