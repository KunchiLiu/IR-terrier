	<brief_summary>Benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) major cause lower urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) affect age men . Medical therapy BPH include alpha adrenergic blocker 5Î±-reductase inhibitor . In men moderate-severe LUTS due BPH , surgical therapy consider 1 ) fail medical therapy and/or 2 ) refractory urinary retention , renal insufficiency secondary BPH , recurrent urinary tract infection ( UTI 's ) , bladder stone . The gold standard surgical therapy BPH transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) . However , TURP associate significant comorbidities bleed , prolonged catheterization , absorptional hyponatremia . To minimize problem associate TURP , alternative minimally invasive treatment technique develop . Two commonly use treatment modality include photoselective laser vaporization prostate ( GreenLight PVP ) use potassium titanyl phosphate ( KTP ) laser holmium laser enucleation prostate ( HoLEP ) . The major problem minimally invasive treatment modality generally associate high retreatment rate . In addition , intraoperative objective measurement , limited , transurethral visualization prostatic cavity , assess extent vaporization enucleation . We propose use transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) novel robot , TRUS robot , hold manipulate TRUS probe monitor extent vaporization enucleation prostate gland intraoperatively . TRUS extensively use biopsy needle guidance prostate biopsy . However , never use transurethral prostate procedure . The TRUS Robot use safely current clinical trial , NA_00027540 , Ultrasound-Guided Navigation Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy . We would like study feasibility safety use TRUS TRUS Robot monitor minimally invasive treatment BPH , GreenLight PVP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In current pilot safety feasibility ( S &amp; F ) study ultrasound-guided PVP ( UG-PVP ) , propose use TRUS TRUS-Robot record ultrasound image PVP 10 patient . The PVP procedure conduct usual , without use ultrasound guide intervention . TRUS image prostate gland intraprostatic cavity form PVP procedure record . These include three dimensional ( 3-D ) image acquire begin end operation . In addition , real-time 2-D image record case . Recorded image analyze offline observe extent vaporization enucleation prostate gland .</detailed_description>
