	<brief_summary>Hip arthroscopy commonly associate moderate-to-severe postoperative pain . The purpose study investigate analgesic efficacy preoperative obturator nerve block measure postoperative pain score postoperative analgesic requirement . The primary outcome patient 's first report pain score post anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound-Guided Obturator Nerve Block Ambulatory Hip Arthroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Patient selection The propose study prospective randomize placebo-controlled trial . Eligibility criterion include patient primary unilateral ambulatory hip arthroscopy femoral acetabular impingement , age 18 65 year , ASA physical status I III , ability follow protocol . Exclusion criterion : patient refusal , inability comprehend consent form , age &lt; 18 , &gt; 65 year age ; contraindication obturator nerve blockade ( pre-existing neuromuscular peripheral nerve disorder , localized infection , bleed disorder ) ; allergy opioids local anesthetic ; allergy celecoxib sulfa medication nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication ( NSAIDs ) ; chronic opioid use ( &gt; 1 month 60 mg morphine PO equivalent daily ) ; , woman pregnant breastfeed . Consent Patients enrol preoperatively either orthopedic surgery clinic anesthesia preoperative clinic hip arthroscopy surgery schedule Randomization , Blinding , Allocation Study medication administer primary investigator perform closely supervise ultrasound-guided obturator nerve block . Randomization perform use computerized random number generator assignment place opaque seal envelope . Upon enrollment study consent obtain , next seal envelope ( number sequentially ) open patient allocate either : - Group 1 ( Treatment ) , Ultrasound-guided obturator nerve block : 20 ml ropivacaine 0.5 % - Group 2 ( Placebo ) , Ultrasound-guided saline placebo block : 5 mL sterile saline 0.9 % The primary investigator involve subsequent postoperative data collection . The sub-investigators perform subsequent data collection blind group allocation . Intervention Following randomization , principle investigator perform block procedure 30 minute prior expect transfer back operate room . Anesthetic care All intraoperative anesthetic care standardize well , include general endotracheal anesthesia induction use propofol 1.5-2mg/kg IV , succinylcholine 1-1.5mg/kg IV rocuronium 0.6-1mg/kg IV ( base clinical discretion blind anesthesia provider ) . In order provide adequate intraoperative analgesia group expect duration procedure , 1 mg intravenous hydromorphone administer 10 minute prior surgical incision . No intraoperative opioids administer . Neuromuscular blockade maintain rocuronium indicate surgical requirement titrate neuromuscular monitoring , reversed standard fashion prior emergence general anesthesia . At end procedure , surgeon inject ropivacaine 0.25 % 30 mL 2 arthroscopic portal sit total 60 ml ropivacaine 0.25 % subject standard practice hip arthroscopy patient . Subjects give log record postoperative pain score oxycodone consumption 1st 24 hour discharge . Outcomes The primary outcome pain immediately upon arrival post anesthesia care unit . This measure 11-point numerical rating scale ( NRS 0 = pain , 10 = worst pain imaginable ) . Secondary outcome include NRS pain score additional time frame pain score self-assessments include : 1 . 3-4 hour arrive home 2 . Within 1 hour prior go sleep 3 . Within 1 hour wake follow day . 4 . 24 hour surgery Additional secondary outcome also include : cumulative 24-hour postoperative opioid consumption , percentage patient postoperative nausea vomiting , sleep disturbance ( difficulty go sleep wake sleep due postoperative pain ) . Expected Time Frame Typically , 4-5 hip arthroscopy per week perform . Thus expect timetable recruitment take least 6-12 month</detailed_description>
