	<brief_summary>Established marker kidney function , creatinine , considerable limitation diagnosis delay graft function ( DGF ) kidney transplantation ( KT ) . Indeed , creatinine accurately reflect minor change renal function level change upon significant fluctuation latter . CAF22 molecule arise degradation large protein propose reliable sensitive marker renal function . This study aim clarify issue measure blood urine concentration CAF22 compare creatinine level KT . The main assumption blood CAF22 level could serve sensitive kidney function biomarker creatinine post-KT detect DGF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Kidney transplantation ( KT ) appropriate therapy end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . While number kidney donor remain stable last decade number patient wait kidney transplantation rapidly increase result utilization increase number marginal renal transplant . These kidney show relatively high percentage delay graft function ( DGF ) , complicate post-transplant management increase duration initial hospitalization cost transplantation . Exact measurement glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) complex clinical setting thus GFR usually estimate serum creatinine level creatinine-based equation MDRD CKD-EPI equation . Particularly , case kidney recipient DGF , creatinine level remain high undergo dialysis . Creatinine dialyzable , reflect actual renal function set due fluctuation level . Thus emergent need accurate renal biomarker . CAF22 C-terminal 22 kDa domain agrin . Agrin cleave specific protease neurotrypsin two distinct site , whereas cleavage beta site generate 22 kDa C-terminal fragment ( CAF22 ) . In kidney agrin part basal lamina , major contributor anionic potential glomerular basement membrane ( GBM ) . There indices proteolytic activity selectively shed C-terminal part agrin GBM . Recently , 19-fold increase CAF22 level ESDR observe , reduce patient receive KT , qualify CAF22 effective renal function marker . Additionally , current data support CAF22 level influence inflammatory process , steroid hemodialysis standard dialysis membrane . Objective Primary : - compare CAF22 versus creatinine biomarkers DGF prediction patient undergo kidney transplantation Secondary : - evaluate kinetics CAF level relate graft function outcomes `` immediate graft function ( IGF ) '' `` delay graft function ( DGF ) '' - elucidate whether CAF make estimation require hemodialysis day patient delayed graft function Methods Research project human associate collection biologic material health-related data . Prospective , observational trial . All patient screen consecutively undergoing kidney transplantation ( KT ) . All participant undergo blood urine sample estimation CAF22 level KT , daily first 7 day KT well 2 , 4 12 week KT . Blood urine sample CAF22 perform routine follow-up sampling .</detailed_description>
