	<brief_summary>To evaluate safety efficacy treatment persistent CMV infection hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) recipient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adoptive Transfer pp65-specific T Cells Treatment Refractory Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HCT recipient receive immunosuppressive agent control graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) high risk serious CMV infection due CMV reactivation reinfection post-transplant period . Antiviral agent use treat CMV infection well-known side effect bone marrow suppression cause cytopenia renal toxicity . Therefore , patient serious condition would higher probability antiviral treatment-related toxicity also increase possibility prolonged antiviral treatment , thus development antiviral resistance risk treatment failure . Allogeneic HCT recipient typically lack CMV-specific T cell post-transplant period immune function repress especially additional immunosuppressive agent prevent GVHD . Therefore , patient may benefit CMV-specific T cell adoptive transfer .</detailed_description>
