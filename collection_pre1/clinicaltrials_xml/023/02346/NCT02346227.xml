	<brief_summary>1 . Introduction Cervical cancer ( CC ) major public health problem Low-income country ( LICs ) , particularly Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) , estimate number case 3839 per year . ( WHO , 2010 ) . Persistent infection Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) recognize necessary cause development CC . Thus , CC disease easily preventable primarily vaccination HPV secondarily screen treatment precancerous lesion cervix . In LICs , high incidence CC due high rate infection HPV , failure initiate sustain effective screening program base cytology non-availability vaccination HPV . These situation highlight need implement simple inexpensive screening treatment method suitable LICs . These method include screen visual inspection cervix application acetic acid ( VIA ) treatment topical antiviral drug ( AV2 ) . 2 . Aims This study aim : - Evaluate clinical efficacy AV2 treatment HPV-associated lesion uterine cervix ; - Identify HPV genotype find Kinshasa ; - Determine cost-effectiveness algorithm combine screen VIA AV2 combine VIA cryotherapy treatment ; 3 . Methods After basic train local health worker VIA , collection cervical sample HPV test ( quantitative Polymerase Chain reaction , qPCR ) liquid-based cytology ( LBC ) application AV2 , screen treatment program offer woman age 25 old give inform consent . All woman lesion VIA randomize one two group receive either treatment AV2 placebo . All woman lesion VIA monitor review two month six month repeat test ( VIA LBC lesion , qPCR viral load , conversion reinfection rate ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CHAPTER 1 : INTRODUCTION 1.1 . BACKGROUND Cervical cancer ( CC ) third common cancer woman , seventh overall , estimate 530 000 new case per year . More 85 % global burden occur low-income country ( LICs ) . It responsible 275 000 death per year , 88 % occur LICs . Overall , mortality : incidence ratio 52 . ( Ferlay et al , 2010 ) . The link genital high-risk Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection CC first demonstrate early 1980s Harold zur Hausen , German virologist . ( Gissmann , L et al , 1983 ) HPV infection may transient persistent . When persists , HPV induce change cell cervix , precisely transformation zone . These change constitute precursor lesion cervical cancer . These precursor lesion either call precancerous lesion , dysplasia cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) . Left untreated , progress mild ( CIN1 ) moderate ( CIN 2 ) severe ( CIN 3 ) dysplasia , cancer . It appear dysplasia asymptomatic progress cancer prolong period time , usually 7 20 year . CC potentially preventable curable cancer . It prevent vaccination HPV screening . The latter involve detection treatment precursor lesion asymptomatic woman . Several test use CC screening : - Cytology ( conventional liquid-based ) also call Pap test Pap smear . - Visual inspection cervix application 5 % acetic acid vinegar ( VIA ) . - HPV-DNA testing . In LIC , method screen low-cost test VIA treat woman positive result treatment cryotherapy one single visit know `` see-and-treat approach '' . This would minimize loss follow , delay treatment missed case . 1.2 ISSUES In HICs , cytology introduce screen test reduce markedly incidence CC . In LICs screen feasible . The high incidence high mortality cervical cancer LIC due high rate infection high-risk HPV , failure initiate sustain effective cervical cancer screen program base cytology non-availability region-specific HPV vaccine program . For reason , VIA HPV test recommend LICs . VIA involve naked eye inspection uterine cervix application 3 5 % acetic acid . Its sensitivity negative predictive value high , reach 95 % study ( Sarian , 2005 ; Sankaranarayanan , 2004 ) . Only limited data available prevalence distribution HPV variant among woman general population DRC . Cytology propose screen tool , 's opportunistic organize cervical cancer screen program base . On hand , Congolese woman , live less 1 dollar day ca n't afford . Vaccination HPV infection introduce yet DRC . It hold promise prevention cervical cancer , yet impact fully realize many year vaccination program institute . To best understand impact large-scale vaccination program , one must first appreciate baseline prevalence HPV subtypes . Thus , secondary-level prevention i.e . screen crucial . Cryotherapy propose way choose treat cervical precancerous lesion low-resource setting hamper major logistic problem ( availability carbon dioxide nitrous oxide ) ; Thus , VIA screening combine simple single treatment vaginal spray AV2 might offer logistical advantage . 1.3 AIMS Overall Aim : To contribute amelioration cervical cancer prevention Democratic Republic Congo . Specific aim : 1 . To evaluate clinical efficacy local AV2 antiviral drug treatment HPV-associated cervical lesion . 2 . To determine genotype HPV find Kinshasa region . 3 . To test impact HPV screening follow virucide treatment see-and-treat setting HPV infection associate cervical lesion . 4. model cost-effectiveness : - VIA screen test virucide treatment algorithm - VIA screen test cryotherapy treatment algorithm 1.4 Hypothesis - The viricidal spray effective placebo treatment HPV-associated cervical precancerous lesion . CHAPITRE 2 : MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 . Study type site : randomize control clinical trial . Sites : Centre Hospitalier du Mont-Amba Centre de santé Lisungi Kinshasa , D.R . Congo . Laboratory test perform laboratory base Antwerp , Belgium . 2.2 . Population : - Women age 25 : There upper limit study population majority woman first screen contact HPV cervical cancer screening . Testing performed woman younger 25 year old expect prevalence HPV high young age woman eliminate virus year . - Sample size power calculation : The investigator would like enough power HPV-positive group without lesion Assuming HPV clearance rate 50 % non-interventional group 70 % virucide group 2 month post-treatment , minimum sample size 163 patient ( i.e. , 124/site ) need show 95 % power 95 % certainty difference group . To allow 10 % drop-outs unevaluable patient , investigator recruit least 190 patient arm . It suppose 50 % HPV-positive demonstrate lesion VIA , signify secondary randomization positive lesion approximately sample size . The investigator expect 20 % woman HPV positive , 10 % 10 % without lesion , indicate 1900 ( ( 190*2 ) /20 % ) woman enrol obtain required sample size . As investigator screen approximately 50 woman per week 70 % willing eligible participate , expect study recruitment last 30 week time first recruitment last patient visit 56 week . 2.3 Study Design 1 . Basic training doctor work peripheral health center formal laboratory facility available . Training involve VIA take cervical swab HPV test LBC , need special technical skill ; health worker train within 1 hour . 2 . A local screening program base VIA offer trained doctor woman age 25 ; Samples qPCR HPV DNA detection , viral load genotyping LBC also collect time application acetic acid . The result lab test available moment randomization serve later analysis . The result cervical cytology report accord 2001 Bethesda system terminology . 3 . Women show lesion VIA randomize one two group receive either AV2 virucide treatment placebo . Women without lesion VIA receive treatment . 4 . All woman lesion followed-up rechecked two month VIA , qPCR LBC . 5 . In test positive VIA control 2 month , cryotherapy offer per WHO criteria ( Annex 4 ) . It perform accord 2011 2012 WHO Guidelines Technical Specifications . 6 . In case cervical cancer detect patient treat accord local protocol resource . 7 . Six month first test , evaluation include VIA , qPCR LBC perform subject test positive beginning . 8 . Those woman persistent precancerous lesion offer appropriate treatment . Those woman without lesion begin whose HPV test cytology result pathologic recalled appropriate management . Further treatment per local protocol stage study end . 2.4 . Statistical analysis Data double-entered clean EpiInfo ( version 6.04b , Centers Diseases Control Prevention ) . Proportions compare use x2 Fisher 's exact test ( require ) ; Student 's test use continuous variable . A paired test use within-patient comparison . Non-normally distributed variable transform , nonparametric test ( Wilcoxon Kruskal-Wallis ) use . The log-rank test proportional hazard estimate ( Schoenfeld test ) . In case proportional hazard regression , patient censor time last recorded visit . Stepwise multivariate analysis perform , possible interaction order 2 test . All report P value 2-sided . For statistical analysis P value ≤ 0.05 consider statistically significant . All analysis perform use STATA statistical analysis software package ( present version 12 ; Stata Corp. ) . 2.5 .
