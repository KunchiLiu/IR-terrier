STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The variable describe ( number frequency categorical variable , mean , standard deviation , median confidence interval continuous quantitative variable ) . The initial comparability two group test . The primary endpoint analyze use Chi-square test without continuity correction validity condition true otherwise Fisher 's exact test . The usual additional criterion ( relative risk 95 ) present . For analysis quantitative secondary endpoint , Student t-test use . If distribution meet normal distribution , nonparametric Mann-Whitney use . The percentage change activity score baseline 6 month 3 month calculate . The qualitative evaluation criterion analyze Chi-square test without continuity correction condition validity check otherwise Fisher 's exact test . An analysis variance repeat measure ( comparison Inclusion- 3 month - 6 month ) make physical activity score take account treatment factor interaction repetition X treatment .</detailed_description>
