	<brief_summary>The overall question investigator would like help answer whether SE without MCE data widely use first line investigation woman previous history Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) present chest pain recent onset . In order answer question investigator look follow : ) Is SE superior ExECG term cost diagnosis negative predictive value CAD ? ii ) What additive value myocardial perfusion data wall motion data predict significant CAD angiography future cardiac event woman ? iii ) What additive value Carotid ultrasonography large population woman refer stress testing ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stress Echocardiography Versus Exercise ECG ( ExECG ) Women With Chest Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan perform prospective study woman see RACPC previous history CAD intermediate pre-test probability CAD determine National Institute Health Care Excellence ( NICE ) guideline , require functional test part assessment . All patient meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion approach consent study . Patients perform great 5 metabolic equivalent ( METS ) Duke Activity Status Index ( DASI ) questionaire randomise undergoing Exercise ECG ( Ex-ECG ) Exercise Stress Echo ( ESE ) . The DASI 12-item questionnaire estimate self-reported physical work capacity convert estimate peak metabolic equivalent . Patients meet criterion , undergo pharmacological stress echocardiogram use Dobutamine ( DSE ) , include Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography ( MCE ) . Investigations continue perform per standard clinical departmental protocol describe . In addition , patient undergo carotid ultrasonography . The technique use described completeness well-established clinical practice .</detailed_description>
