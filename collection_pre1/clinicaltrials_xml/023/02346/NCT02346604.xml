	<brief_summary>People mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) significant physiological abnormality breathe inefficiency become pronounce stress exercise , lead intolerable breathe discomfort ( dyspnea ) . To good understand mechanisms respiratory symptom exercise limitation mild COPD , examine detail lung function test important measurement rest exercise people mild COPD compare healthy non-smokers . This first study uncover fundamental cause breathe inefficiency relate shortness breath physical exertion patient mild COPD . We hope demonstrate one simple measurement exercise [ relation ( ratio ) total amount air breathe ( ventilation ) amount carbon dioxide breathe ] give meaningful information extent damage small airway blood vessel mild COPD overall gas exchange function lung , without need arterial blood sample . This case-controlled observational study involve intervention . Participants complete 2 visit approximately 1 week apart , conducted time day . Visit 1 consiste screen iligibility , symptom activity assessment , pulmonary function test incremental cycle cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) familiarization purpose . Visit 2 include spirometry follow incremental cycle CPET detail measure ventilatory , gas exchange , sensory-perceptual arterial blood gas response .</brief_summary>
