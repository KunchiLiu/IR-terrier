	<brief_summary>Background : - It important doctor know much fat person body . Machines call DXAs measure much fat mass fat-free mass person . Researchers study new DXA machine , want know measure body fat well old machine . They also want see body fat reading new DXA compare reading magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Objectives : - To see two DXA machine give result measure body fat . Also , know whether DXA MRI give result measure visceral subcutaneous fat . Eligibility : - People 18 year old weigh less 350 pound . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . Women pregnancy test . Researchers make sure participant able MRI volunteer . - Participants body fat measure DXA scanner . They lie quietly pad table scan . The scan use X-rays take picture body . Both scan do morning take 10-15 minute machine . - Some participant also body fat measure MRI . They lie long , tube-shaped scanner . The machine use strong magnetic field radio wave take picture internal organ . Participants sign additional consent form procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our Research unit ( NIDDK ) recently acquire new x-ray unit ( General Electric ( GE ) Lunar iDXA ) measurement body composition ( much fat someone percent weight ) . This machine provide clear crisper image . The unit also large table allow patient 450 lb ( 204 kg ) scan . The large table allows easier position tall heavy patient . We would like use new machine future want see whether current DXA unit ( Lunar Prodigy Densitometer GE ) Lunar iDXA Densitometer ( GE ) measure percentage person body fat . If measurement difference two machine , develop way convert new result closely match result current DXA unit . Thus , study , ask volunteer undergo scan measurement body fat machine day . Fat within belly around organ ( call visceral fat VAT ) link bad health outcome fat underneath skin ( call subcutanoues fat SAT ) . Along standardize DXA - body composition measurement result would like compare VAT SAT estimate iDXA value obtain MRI . The precise MRI measurement completely avoid radiation exposure volunteer far time consume . Knowing result iDXA match correlate MRI result would allow u use iDXA measurement estimate visceral subcutaneous adipose tissue depot ongoing future study .</detailed_description>
