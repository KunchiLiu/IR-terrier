	<brief_summary>The purpose present study analyze effect 12 week resistance train post-exercise blood pressure ( BP ) correlate acute chronic decrease blood pressure ( BP ) follow resistance train normotensive old woman . Twenty-eight old woman randomly assign train group ( TG ) control group ( CG ) . The TG underwent resistance training program ( 8 exercise , 2 set , 10-15 repetition ) , CG perform stretch exercise ( 2 set , 20 , 2 nonconsecutive days/week ) . Both group perform intervention 12 week . At baseline intervention subject submit two session : resistance exercise session control session . In session , BP obtain pre post-sessions . Rest blood pressure also measure baseline 12 week intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resistance Training Post-exercise Blood Pressure Normotensive Older Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Older ( ≥60 year ) normotensive physically inactive woman recruit . Women randomize train group ( TG ) control group ( CG ) submit 12 week intervention . The intervention program divide three phase : initial ( first two week ) , intermediate ( week 3 week 10 ) final ( last two week ) . The TG submit resistance training program consist eight exercise perform two set 10 15 repetition , three time per week . The CG perform stretch train program major muscle group , session 30 minute , twice week . These intervention maintain 12 week . During initial final phase subject group submit two acute experimental session : resistance exercise control , perform random order . The resistance exercise session similar perform resistance training program ( i.e. , 7 exercise , 2 set , 10-15 repetition ) . In control session participant remain seated 40 min . Before session BP parameter obtain . The chronic effect resistance train post-exercise BP assess analyze change ( ∆ ) BP acute experimental session initial final phase . The correlation acute chronic response blood pressure follow resistance training analyse correlate acute blood pressure observe initial phase chronic effect resistance training rest blood pressure .</detailed_description>
