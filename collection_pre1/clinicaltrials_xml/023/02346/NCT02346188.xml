	<brief_summary>Lead negatively link nutritional status , behavior cognition child . Despite extensive knowledge toxicity effort reduce exposure , lead continue problem develop develop country . When lead exposure unavoidable due pervasive nature , effective mean protect disrupt exposure need develop . Nutritional intervention one option . We conduct 2x2 factorial , placebo-controlled trial 6-month iron zinc supplementation among lead-exposed child Torreón , Mexico ( altitude 1060 ) . Nine school select base proximity lead smelter first-graders individually randomize daily treatment 30 mg iron , 30 mg zinc , , placebo . In addition biochemical indicator , cognitive function behavior evaluate baseline , 6-month supplementation period , another 6 month ( without supplementation ) . At baseline , 602 child age 6.2-8.5 year enrol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We conduct 2x2 factorial , placebo-controlled trial 6-month iron zinc supplementation among lead-exposed child Torreón , Mexico ( altitude 1060 ) test hypothesis supplementation iron , zinc reduce blood lead concentration child improve cognition behavior . Nine school select base proximity lead smelter first-graders individually randomize daily treatment 30 mg iron , 30 mg zinc , , placebo . In addition biochemical indicator ( blood lead , serum ferritin , CRP , serum zinc , urinary arsenic concentration ) , cognitive function behavior measure . Assessments conduct three time point : baseline , 6 month treatment , another 6 month without treatment . At baseline , 602 child age 6.2-8.5 year enrol .</detailed_description>
