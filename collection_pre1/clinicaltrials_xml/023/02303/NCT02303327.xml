	<brief_title>Comparative Study Radiotherapy Treatments Treat High Risk Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In North America , number new case prostate cancer increase every year . To day , standard curative treatment high risk prostate cancer patient external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) combine hormonal manipulation ( Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone LHRH agonists Eligard ) low level testosterone slow even stop growth prostate cancer . It recently demonstrate combination high dose rate brachytherapy ( HDRB ) boost ( direct insertion radiation source prostate kill tumor ) EBRT could effective treatment prostate cancer patient . On hand , recent study suggest dose escalation hypofractionated radiation delivery ( large radiation dose per daily treatment ) efficient standard fractionation prostate cancer patient . This phase III clinical trial design compare safety conventional pelvic EBRT combine HDRB boost ( i.e . 46 Gy 23 fraction follow 15-Gy HDRB boost ) short course hypofractionated dose escalation radiotherapy ( i.e . 68 Gy 25 fraction ) patient high risk prostate cancer . The patient randomize either two different course treatment . All patient also treat hormonal therapy total duration 28 month ( 2 month radiation therapy ( RT ) , 2 month RT 24 month RT ) . The patient undergo different test treatment , bone scan , blood test , CT scan bone density . The patient 's follow-up first month start RT , every 4 month first 2 year , every 6 month third year annually 10 year . On every visit , patient undergo digital rectal examination ( DRE ) well evaluation testosterone prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level . The safety new course radiation therapy evaluate acute ( 90 day ) delay toxicity ( 90 day , 180 day ) measure Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE version 4 ) . We also determine Biochemical Failure Free Survival , Distant Metastasis Free Survival , Disease Specific Survival , Overall Survival Health-related Quality Life use Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite ( EPIC ) . We also monitor development gastrointestinal genitourinary toxicity establish predictive value PTEN deletion TMPRSS2ETS fusion ( genetic marker predict nature progression prostate tumor ) . This study conduct Genitourinary Radiation Oncology Group Quebec ( GROUQ ) 12 select radiation oncology center . We plan recruit 296 patient across Quebec recruitment complete within 24 month activation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate diagnose within 6 month prior randomization , ( long 6 month , need approved PI ) . Clinical stage include least one following : T3 T4 , Gleason Score &gt; 8 , and/ Prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) &gt; 20 ( ng/ml Î¼g/L ) . Pelvic paraaortic lymph node must negative CT scan MRI abdomen pelvis perform within 12 ( recommended time limit , may exceed certain case ) week prior randomization . For patient start androgen suppression prior randomization , CT MRI may do start therapy , provide do 28 day follow start androgen suppression therapy ( lymph node appear &gt; 1.5 cm CT MRI must histologically negative either needle aspirate lymph node dissection perform within 12 week prior randomization ) . Investigations , include chest xray ( CXR recommend mandatory ) CT scan bone scan ( radiographs suspicious area ) perform within 12 week ( recommended time limit ) prior randomization negative metastasis . For patient start androgen suppression prior randomization , bone scan may do include 28 day commencement therapy . Patients PSA test do time diagnosis . This PSA test could repeat within 28 day prior randomization . The PSA value use confirm high risk disease value enter eligibility checklist must higher two value . These criterion regardless whether patient initiate hormone therapy prior randomization . The patient may receive prior androgen suppression therapy provide androgen suppression therapy commence 28 day prior randomization . The patient must receive cytotoxic anticancer therapy prostate cancer prior randomization . Patients may receive treatment 5alphareductase inhibitor ( e.g . Finasteride ) benign prostatic hypertrophy ( BPH ) , must discontinue prior randomization . ECOG performance status must 0 1 . Hematology Biochemistry : Laboratory requirement do within 2842 day prior randomization : hemoglobin &gt; 100 g/L , absolute Neutrophils &gt; 1.5 x 109/L , platelet &gt; 100 x 109/L , serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN Patients history malignancy , except : nonmelanoma skin cancer ; solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease &gt; 5 year . The presence smallcell transitionalcell carcinoma biopsy specimen . Patients previous chemotherapy carcinoma prostate . Patients prior surgical treatment carcinoma prostate apart transurethral resection , include bilateral orchiectomy . Patients contraindication pelvic radiotherapy : include , limited , previous pelvic radiotherapy . Inflammatory bowel disease ( discretion treat oncologist ) severe bladder irritability . Patients serious non malignant disease result life expectancy le 3 year . Other serious illness , psychiatric medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol include active uncontrolled infection significant cardiac dysfunction . Patients medical condition would contraindicate treatment regimen outline protocol [ e.g . intake study drug ] . Known hypersensitivity protocolindicated study medication . Presence bilateral hip replacement prosthesis . Patients history severe congestive heart failure eligible . Patients congenital long QT syndrome patient take Class IA , Class III Class IC antiarrhythmic medication require cardiologist 's evaluation prior eligibility assessment . Patients cardiovascular disease include long benefit androgen deprivation therapy outweigh potential risk cardiovascular event .</criteria>
