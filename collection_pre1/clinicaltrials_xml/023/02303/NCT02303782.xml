	<brief_summary>This study design first part ( phase Ib ) determine recommend dose OTX015 + Vidaza ( azacitidine ) combination newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia patient candidate standard intensive induction therapy . It follow randomized phase II part ass efficacy combination use 2 arm : Vidaza ( azacitidine ) alone vs. OTX015 combination Vidaza ( azacitidine ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Signed informed consent prior begin protocolspecific procedure . Patients register trial must treat follow participate center . 2 . Newlydiagnosed confirmed AML , define &gt; 20 % myeloid blast bone marrow . 3 . Patients candidate standard intensive induction therapy ( SIIT ) anthracycline cytarabine ( 3+7 ) due age , and/or poor general condition , and/or comorbidities , and/or condition predict poor benefit/risk ratio chemotherapy , include complex karyotype secondary AML ( include myelodysplastic feature 2030 % bone marrow blast , already standard indication AZA single agent therapy ) . There upper age limit protocol definition comorbidities . The decision patient candidate SIIT make investigator team accord routine daily practice , base combination parameter patient preference . The reason noneligibility SIIT document inclusion procedure characterize treated population . 4 . Patients &gt; 18 year old . 5 . Life expectancy least 3 month . 6 . ECOG performance status ( PS ) 0 2 . Patients PS &gt; 2 time diagnosis may still enrol , provide PS improve ≤2 hematologic supportive care ( transfusion , antibiotic , hydration , correction metabolic disturbance , correction hyperleukocytosis hydroxyurea ) . 7 . Patients previously receive antileukemia drug , except hydroxyurea ( ± mercaptopurine [ 6MP ] thioguanine [ 6TG ] ) , give control rapidly increase hyperleukocytosis . Hydroxyurea ( ±6MP 6TG ) must stop least 48 hour prior start study treatment . It may resume control hyperleukocytosis Day 3 57 . Patients still need hydroxyurea ( ± 6MP 6TG ) beyond Day 57 ( end cycle 2 case treatment delay ) consider treatment failure . 8 . Calculated creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) &lt; 30 mL/min ( Cockroft &amp; Gault formula , MDRD formula patient age &gt; 65 year ) . Patients CrCl &lt; 60 mL/min consider risk increase hematologic toxicity renal toxicity . 9 . Adequate LFTs : Total bilirubin ≤ institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; ALAT/ASAT &gt; 3 x ULN ( &gt; 5 x ULN case leukemic liver involvement ) . 10 . Serum albumin &gt; 28 g/L . 11 . Complete baseline disease assessment workup ( include routine cytogenetics centralize assessment molecular biomarkers ) prior first study treatment administration . 1 . Pregnant lactate woman woman childbearing potential use adequate contraception . Male patient use adequate contraception . 2 . Patients acute promyelocytic leukemia , uncontrolled symptomatic disseminate intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) . 3 . Increasing stable hyperleukocytosis &gt; 15 G/L despite optimal hydroxyurea dose ( ± 6MP 6TG ) . 4 . Uncontrolled diseaserelated metabolic disorder . 5 . Patients unable swallow oral medication gastrointestinal condition ( e.g . malabsorption , resection ) deem jeopardize intestinal absorption OTX015 . 6 . Other serious illness medical condition , investigator 's opinion could hamper understand study patient , patient 's compliance study treatment , patient 's safety interpretation study result . These condition include ( restrict ) : Congestive heart failure angina pectoris except medically control , previous history myocardial infarction within 1 year study entry , uncontrolled hypertension arrhythmia . Significant neurologic psychiatric disorder impair ability obtain consent . Second cancer , need systemic therapy . Known HIV positivity , hepatitis B positivity surface antigen expression , active hepatitis C infection ( PCR positive antiviral therapy hepatitis C within last 6 month ) . 7 . Concomitant therapy strong CYP3A4 interfering drug . 8 . Concurrent treatment experimental therapy participation another clinical trial within 21 day prior first study treatment administration 5 halflives previously administer drug , whichever long , previous antileukemic therapy hydroxyurea ( ± 6MP 6TG ) .</criteria>
