	<detailed_description>PURPOSE AND JUSTIFICATION Cancer relate psychological sequela significant impact breast cancer survivor ' cognitive functioning . Depression negative affect show highly correlate reduce verbal knowledge , verbal memory , spatial ability , figural memory . In addition , self-reported psychological stress correlate perceived cognitive deficit poor performance test memory , verbal fluency , attention breast cancer patient post-treatment . Similarly , depression anxiety among breast cancer survivor show significantly correlate subjective cognitive dysfunction include reduced attention , concentration , memory . Moreover , persist somatic sequela include pain , fatigue , sleep disturbance indirect critical influence breast cancer survivor ' cognitive functioning . The study Caplette-Gingras , Savard , Savard , Ivers indicate breast cancer survivor sleep disturbance exhibit reduce cognitive functioning episodic memory executive functioning report subjective cognitive deficit comparison breast cancer survivor without sleep disturbance . Further , fatigue cognitive dysfunction show significant association among breast cancer survivor . Somatic challenge persist survivor ' completion treatment clearly exhibit adverse cognitive impairment . Cognitive deficit one cognitive sequela breast cancer adversely impact survivor ' general well-being . Persisting psychological somatic symptom various treatment receive breast cancer reason cognitive deficit post-cancer . Chemotherapy hormonal blockade therapy directly associate adverse impact cognitive function include memory , executive functioning , attention . Radiotherapy surgery also show impact breast cancer survivor ' cognitive functioning . These cognitive impairment impact survivor ' quality life general functioning . Therefore , endure cognitive deficit result breast cancer treatment significant effect survivor ' health re-establishment normalcy . While breast cancer survivorship bolster hope cancer-free life , endure cancer-related symptom impact survivor ' occupational social functioning , return may impinge recovery . Returning previously hold role allow good recovery breast cancer treatment , long survivorship low reoccurrence rate . However , breast cancer survivor among majority 13 % cancer survivor stop work 4 year post-cancer due `` cancer-related reason '' . Employed woman breast cancer history report learning , long-term memory , attention , concentration , executive functioning problem . Hence , report cognitive difficulty impact job performance , ability work , job maintenance . These cognitive deficit impact breast cancer survivor ' work performance ability retain position also impact survivor ' psychological social well-being vice-versa . Most individual experience psychological ( i.e. , depression , anxiety ) somatic distress ( pain , fatigue sleep ) report cognitive difficulty shortcoming . Similarly , breast cancer survivor report experience cognitive difficulty relation psychological somatic distress . Although , cognitive difficulty experience individual ' without cancer history impact individual quality life level functioning ; cognitive deficit breast cancer survivor endure cancer treatment ( i.e. , chemotherapy ) impact cognitive functioning great extend . This shortcoming post cancer treatment impact cancer survivor ' everyday functioning quality life different level , impact survivorship experience overall functioning . Cognitive limitation among breast cancer survivor context work ass cognitive deficit survivor experience work . Given cognitive functioning among breast cancer survivor affect various factor , cancer diagnosis treatment , work-related cognitive limitation might also impact numerous variable . Nevertheless , study yet do explore work-related cognitive limitation among employed breast cancer survivor association various cancer-related symptom . Most study assess implication survivorship work performance outcome among breast cancer survivor focus work-related cognitive limitation . For example , work-output performance show impact negatively result persist symptom experience breast cancer survivor , fatigue reduce physical mental ability . The study investigate work-related cognitive limitation look relationship work-related cognitive limitation work output . Other Ottati Feuerstein , study look relationship cancer-related symptom work-related cognitive limitation among breast cancer survivor . Although , study Ottati Feuerstein look relationship cancer-related symptom work-related cognitive limitation , assess depression , anxiety , fatigue pain cancer-related symptom . They assess association cognitive functioning sleep disturbance cancer-related symptom relation work-related cognitive limitation . In addition , study involve healthy control group ass difference amongst two group . The propose study seek evaluate relationship biopsychosocial function work-related cognitive limitation among employed breast cancer survivor cross-sectional study healthy control group . Specifically , study assess work-related cognitive limitation association depression , anxiety , pain , fatigue , sleep disturbance , cognitive deficit employ woman without history breast cancer . The primary purpose study assess impact objective cognitive functioning well predictor cognitive shortcoming work place comparison self-report cognitive measure . The secondary purpose ass work related cognitive limitation breast cancer survivor comparison counterpart ( employed woman without history cancer diagnosis ) . The third purpose explore sociodemographic variable marital status , education , age , race , ethnicity relate perceive cognitive limitation work among breast cancer survivor . Additionally , study examine effect medical variable covariates relationship . Subsequently , study examine level mindful attention awareness possible mediator psychological , somatic cognitive distress work-related cognitive limitation . I . STUDY AIM AND HYPOTHESIS 1 . Hypothesis question ( ) address : A . Psychological symptom ( increased depression , anxiety , distress ) account significant amount variance predict work-related cognitive limitation . B. Somatic symptom ( fatigue , pain , sleep disturbance ) account significant amount variance predict work-related cognitive limitation . C.Self-reported cognitive complaint positively correlate work-related cognitive limitation group . CI . After control psychological somatic factor , objective cognitive function emerge significant predictor cognitive difficulty work . CII . After control psychological somatic factor , employ breast cancer survivor present work-related cognitive limitation comparison control group . D. Marital status , race/ethnicity , age , education , socioeconomic status act moderator psychological , somatic , cognitive sequela work-related cognitive limitation . E. Medical variable , prior treatment , work history potentially act covariates . F. Level mindfulness attention awareness potentially act moderator level cognitive performance work place group . II .
