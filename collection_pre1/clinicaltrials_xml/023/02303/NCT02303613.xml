	<brief_summary>Background : Triage emergency department ( ED ) together initial assessment use identify patient 's level urgency treatment base triage level . Triage ED complex decision-making process , several triage scale design decision support system guide triage nurse correct decision . Worldwide four well know five-level triage system use . In 2010 , 97 % EDs Sweden introduce process-oriented triage scale physiological parameter call Rapid Emergency Traige Treatment System ( RETTS ) . RETTS two main assessment variable : vital sign chief complaint , describe incident symptom cause patient seek care . These two variable evaluate result color cod 5-level scale . Each level priority define time limit within evaluation doctor begin . Although , international triage system guideline seem function well western country , difficult implement high failure rate develop low-income country . One reason may lack extensive training . Teaching assess ability perform mass casualty triage inherently challenge due inability accurately replicate give disaster environment comprehensive way . Disaster drill simulation exercise way train triage performance different tool available . One tool contribute kind training may Emergo Train SystemÂ® ( ETS ) . ETS similar interactive educational simulation system could use test evaluate incident command system , surge capacity , hospital preparedness triage . Study objective study III : The aim study validate currently practice system triage ED Moi Teaching Referral Hospital Eldoret , Kenya RETTS . Furthermore map current patient outcome trauma patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A tool develop research group . It develop identification trauma patient record , detail enter later transfer Excel format ease analysis . Trauma patient card record collect data include respiratory rate , pulse , blood pressure , GCS , SaO2 , body temperature , type injury mechanism injury develop use . Time accident arrival ED , sex , age intervention ED also register . Time ED , number day patient treated hospital visit also go register . According protocol also discharge evaluation The International Classification Disease ( ICD ) Injury Severity Score ( ISS ) register .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Close 600 trauma patient age 14 see ED capture . All patient present ED identify meet inclusion criterion recruit study daily basis close 600 patient record achieve . Patients follow ED receive facility ( ward , ICU , HDU , theatre etc ) Those bring dead , 14 year , revisits , refer patient exclude The patient record trace entire period patient hospital key decision make triage category ED receive unit . There may need follow patient longer since study limited period , record make 30 day admission admit last month .</criteria>
