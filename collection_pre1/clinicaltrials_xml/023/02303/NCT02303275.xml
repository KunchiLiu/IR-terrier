	<brief_summary>Summary Chronic heart failure continue one high economic burden United States , heavily influenced frequent readmission hospital . This study examine whether patient 65 year old , NYHA class II III heart failure , improve symptom participate comprehensive 12-week lifestyle change program . The investigator recruit potential subject primarily Scripps Clinic heart failure clinic Torrey Pines campus . Qualifying subject randomize medical treatment usual lifestyle program . The investigator enroll 17 subject group provide 80 % power alpha 0.05 . The lifestyle change program consist class conduct three time week 12 week Scripps Center Integrative Medicine . Each day participant spend four five hour variety class monitor exercise , group support , mindful-yoga meditation , vegetarian cooking class , music-centered wellness , mind-body lecture , resiliency training . The primary outcome focus determine functional status physical agility use 6-minute walk test , handgrip strength , NYHA class category . In addition , investigator capture subjective physical status self-reported questionnaire . Cognitive assessment perform use Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool . To capture subject 's overall self-reported improvement investigator use quality life depression questionnaire . Secondary endpoint include hospital admission rate all-cause mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator Research Question Hypothesis follow : Comprehensive , evidence-based lifestyle psychosocial intervention 12-week period ( Lifestyles Change Program ) improve various objective ( 6-minute walk distance , Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) , New York Heart Association Class , grip strength , cognitive function ) well subjective ( Quality life , depression functional screening ) measure patient chronic heart failure . Secondary endpoint would include data hospital admission rate all-cause mortality . Background/ Gaps Knowledge Chronic heart failure continue one high economic burden United States , heavily influenced frequent readmission . As measure performance quality , Center Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) begin publically report hospital risk-standardized 30-day all-cause readmission rate , among fee-for-service beneficiary discharge hospitalization heart failure US acute care hospital ( 1 ) . Previous report average hospital readmission patient chronic heart failure average 25 % 30 % , study show readmission rate 45 % 6 month . There significant research examine various method reduce hospital admission improve functional capacity patient heart failure . Aside publish data patient factor associate readmission ( age , sex , race , education , diabetes , renal disease , history stroke , cognitive impairment , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class level , serum marker [ blood urea nitrogen , creatinine , C-reactive protein ] , etc ) , many prospective study evaluate readmission rate CHF use intervention include : specialized multi-disciplinary team ( CHF nursing staff , pharmacist , physician , etc ) , telephonic home monitoring , implantable device monitoring , various exercise program ( intermittent vs. continuous ) , meditation spirituality , early hospital follow-up . Attempts create valid statistical model predict patient high risk readmission use heterogeneous approach find substantial inconsistency regard patient characteristic predictive . From policy perspective , 2009 , validate risk-standardized model accurately profile hospital use readmission rate unavailable publish English-language literature date ( 3 ) . Essentially , identification patient high risk heart failure readmission remain difficult validated objective assessment . Therefore , strategy reduce readmission heart failure patient evolve become personalized , patient-centered approach base specific need patient . For example , study evaluate patient v physician healthcare staff perception cause heart failure readmission ( use standardize questionnaire ) , show discrepancy physician 's opinion v patient 's opinion factor influence readmission . In essence , various aspect LCP evaluate controlled clinical trial , overall , comprehensive study evaluate multiple component include LCP ( investigator knowledge ) do . Previous randomize controlled trial show benefit ( 6-minute walk , NYHA class , etc ) use cardiac rehabilitation patient CHF ( 12 ) . Yoga show improve exercise tolerance positively affected level inflammatory marker patient CHF , trend towards improvement QoL ( 11 ) . Education dietitian patient CHF also show result significant decrease sodium intake compare patient simply receive write instruction ( 9 ) . Studies also evaluate spiritual well-being depression patient heart failure , show great spiritual well-being , particularly meaning/ peace strongly associate less depression ( 6 ) . Interestingly , Tai Chi use complimentary medicine many year patient cardiovascular disease . Recently , randomize study 2011 show Tai Chi exercise improve quality life , mood , exercise self-efficacy patient CHF ( 5 ) . The investigator goal currently describe study use comprehensive , evidence-based Lifestyle Change Program ( LCP ) incorporate individual component single program , individualized patient 's physical ability . Moreover , investigator hypothesis intervention chronic heart failure patient improve Quality Life , objective cardiometabolic marker , reduce hospital admissions..</detailed_description>
