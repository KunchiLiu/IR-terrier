To knowledge , however , systematic effort examine impact intervention weight status asthma outcome , effort tailor program specific need OV/OB child asthma . The aim study develop test Childhood Health Asthma Management Program ( CHAMP ) , behavioral family-based lifestyle intervention community-based promote successful weight asthma management OV/OB child asthma . The investigator propose develop intervention base previously developed behavioral family-based lifestyle intervention community-based produce positive long term weight status change OV/OB child tailor OV/OB child asthma create CHAMP .
