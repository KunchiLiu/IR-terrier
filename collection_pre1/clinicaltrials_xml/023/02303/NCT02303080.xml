	<brief_title>Whey Protein Micelles Thermogenesis Overweight Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective outcome : The primary objective trial measure thermogenic effect two different dos whey protein microgels ( WPM ) . Secondary objective outcome : Explore mechanism action WPM thermogenesis include : Protein turnover response dose source protein ( WPM versus casein ) Insulinemic glycemic response dose source protein ( WPM versus casein ) Design : The propose study randomize double-blind , placebo-controlled , single center , crossover design . At start study , subject randomly assign 4 different group crossover design , ask consume beverage contain Product 1 : 0g protein ( maltodextrin control ) Product 2 : 30g WPM Product 3 : 50g WPM Product 4 : 50g micellar casein ( MC ) Number subject : The number subject 15 . Sufficient subject recruit provide 30 % drop-out rate . Therefore 20 subject need include drop-outs .</detailed_description>
