	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Nuc-1031 Carboplatin Combination Treat Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nuc-1031 carboplatin combination new experimental treatment ovarian cancer reappear standard chemotherapy . Chemotherapy name drug treatment kill control growth cancer cell . Although evidence laboratory clinical study Nuc-1031 effective treatment ovarian cancer , yet test combination another chemotherapy drug . So combination treatment class first human study ( Phase1B ) . The aim study investigate whether add Nuc-1031 carboplatin improve benefit chemotherapy . Other purpose find whether Nuc-1031 safe give carboplatin , identify correct dose Nuc-1031 give carboplatin establish effective combination treat ovarian cancer . This study also design enable u find whether Nuc-1031 add benefit , achieve carboplatin alone , treat ovarian cancer . carboplatin combination give six cycle . Each cycle 3 week long . On first day first week cycle ( day1 ) , select study participant receive one dose Nuc-1031 Carboplatin chemotherapy . Following , study participant receive second dose Nuc-1031 alone first day second week ( day 8 ) . This schedule repeat every 3 week 6 cycle .</detailed_description>
