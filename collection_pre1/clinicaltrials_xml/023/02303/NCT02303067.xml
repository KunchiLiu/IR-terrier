	<brief_summary>Background : - This study design people need standard , non-research invasive coronary angiogram find heart disease . Researchers want take compute tomography ( CT ) scan people heart procedure see less invasive test also diagnose coronary artery disease . Objectives : - To learn new way view CT picture able accurately diagnose coronary artery disease . Eligibility : - People age 55 old need coronary angiogram . Design : - Participants screen medical record . - Participants may give blood sample . - Participants may CT scan heart without contrast . The CT scan interfere medical care . - Participants blood pressure heart rhythm monitor , , CT scan . They may electrocardiogram . - Before scan , participant intravenous catheter put arm . It use inject contrast . - Participants may take beta blocker slow heart rate . - Participants may take nitroglycerin tongue . It enlarge heart blood vessel improve picture quality . It may cause flush sensation headache . - Participants lie back pad table . The table slide large , donut-shaped machine . An x-ray tube move around body , take picture . They ask hold breath 5 second time . - Participants call 30 day angiogram . They answer question health , hospital visit , medical treatment .</brief_summary>
