	<brief_summary>With estimate prevalence 4 35 % , hemorrhoidal disease frequent proctologic disease . Its symptom mainly rectorrhagia , externalization hemorrhoidal cushion ( muco-hemorrhoidal prolapse ) , and/or pain pruritus . Its acute complication ( external and/or internal thromboses ) unpredictable . Surgical treatment concern approximately 10 % patient diagnose hemorrhoidal pathology . The elective ligature arteria haemorrhoidalis trans-anal Doppler scanning develop order reduce postoperative morbidity hemorrhoidal surgery . This technique consist ligation superior rectal artery Doppler control order decrease blood flow within hemorrhoid therefore reduce . It effective treatment internal hemorrhoidal pathology without prolapse ( grade II ) . The complication rate low estimate 2 12 % : rectorrhagia ( 4.3 % ) , thrombosed hemorrhoid ( 1,8 % ) , fissure ( 0,8 % ) , acute urine retention ( 0,7 % ) . With major advance interventional radiology ligation could perform endovascular coil embolization . Until direct study exist subject several case report show feasibility embolization superior rectal artery rectorrhagia various etiology hemorrhoidal disease . Endovascular access increase selectivity embolization compare Doppler scan technique . Indeed arteriography make possible scan branch superior rectal artery therefore occlude permanently branch fee hemorrhoidal plexus . Moreover endovascular embolization technique avoid main complication trans-anal access technique . The primary objective study : assessment efficacy endovascular coil embolization superior rectal artery management symptom hemorrhoidal disease grade II III . The secondary objective : assessment postoperative complication .</brief_summary>
