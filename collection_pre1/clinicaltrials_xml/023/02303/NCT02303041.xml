	<brief_title>Sonidegib Buparlisib Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Basal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall response rate ( ORR ) sonidegib ( erismodegib ) combination buparlisib ( hereby refer `` LB therapy '' ) patient locally advance metastatic basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) Smoothened inhibitor naive patient ( Cohort 1 ) whose disease refractory relapse Smoothened inhibitor monotherapy ( Cohort 2 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate median duration response , LB therapy . II . To assess safety tolerability LB therapy . III . To assess histopathologic effect LB therapy tumor biopsy obtain baseline follow 12 week treatment . IV . To assess effect LB therapy gene expression include Hedgehog pathway phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathways . V. To assess correlation gene mutation Smoothened , suppressor fuse homolog ( Sufu ) , patch ( PTCH ) , glioma-associated oncogene homolog ( Gli ) 1,2 gene expression profile response LB therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive sonidegib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) buparlisib PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month .</detailed_description>
