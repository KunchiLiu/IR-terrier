	<brief_summary>This prospective , observational pilot study describe safety profile biological effect combine stereotactic ablative body radiosurgery ( SABR ) treatment ( 20Gy/1 # ) PD-1 antibody , MK-3475 . 15 patient oligometastatic breast cancer least one lesion consider safe SABR radiotherapy , treat SABR oligometatastic disease addition 6 month MK-3475 treatment ( 1 cycle every 3 week , total 8 cycle ) . This investigator drive pilot study examine safety biological effect combine MK-3475 ( Pembrolizumab ) antibody target anti-programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) T cell checkpoint , SABR therapy oligometastatic disease . We hypothesise safety profile combination , clinically acceptable well tolerated patient , observe evidence systemic immune activation .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Be willing able provide write informed consent/assent trial . 2 . Be 18 year age day sign informed consent . 3 . Have histologically cytologically confirm breast cancer . Oligometastatic lesion need biopsied must strongly suspect represent metastatic disease . 4 . CT scan ( Chest , Abdo + Pelvis ) , Whole Body Bone scan , FDGPET scan evidence 1 5 metastasis within 8 week study registration . Note : At least 1 5 metastasis must deem suitable SABR treatment . 5 . Be willing provide tissue newly obtain core excisional biopsy tumour lesion . Newlyobtained defined specimen obtain 6 week ( 42 day ) prior initiation treatment Day 1 . Participants newlyobtained sample provide ( e.g . inaccessible participant safety concern ) may submit archived specimen upon agreement study P.I 's . 6 . Have performance status 02 ECOG Performance Scale . 7 . Demonstrate adequate organ function . 8 . Life expectancy &gt; 12 month . 9 . Be willing able comply study requirement , include treatment , attend assessment followup . 10 . Female patient childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy within 7 day study registration retested within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . 11 . Female patient childbearing potential must willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose MK3475 . Patients childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . 12 . Male patient must agree use adequate method contraception start first SABR treatment , 120 day last dose MK3475 . 1 . Previous high dose radiotherapy ( biological equivalent 20 Gy 5 fraction area treat ) . 2 . Evidence visceral metastasis liver brain . 3 . Treatment chemotherapy agent within +/ 3 week SABR . Targeted therapy endocrine therapy permit stage conduct study , however change study period unless due progression . 4 . Evidence Spinal Cord Compression . 5 . Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score great equal 7 unless lesion review neurosurgical service consider stable . 6 . Surgical fixation lesion require stability . 7 . Lytic metastasis long bone ( femur humerus ) erode cortex . 8 . Is currently participate participate study investigational agent use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . 9 . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive chronic systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . Single dose acceptable . 10 . Has prior monoclonal antibody within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , less equal Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients must receive denosumab study . 11 . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 3 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , less equal Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects less equal Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . 12 . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ cervical cancer undergone potentially curative therapy . 13 . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . 14 . Has active automimmune disease require systemic treatment within past 3 month document history clinically severe autoimmune disease , syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent . Subjects vitiligo resolve childhood asthma/atopy would exception rule . Subjects require intermittent use bronchodilator local steroid injection would exclude study . Subjects hypothyroidism stable hormone replacement Sjorgen 's syndrome exclude study . 15 . Has evidence interstitial lung disease active , noninfectious pneumonitis . 16 . Has active infection require systemic therapy . 17 . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . 18 . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . 19 . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . 20 . Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , antiCytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 ( CTLA4 ) antibody ( include ipilimumab antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation checkpoint pathway ) . 21 . Has know history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . 22 . Has know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . 23 .
