Patients active control group advise walk regularly base brochures 30minutenbewegen.nl . All primary secondary outcome assess baseline ( T0 ; prior randomization ) , completion 6-month exercise intervention ( T1 ) , similar time-point patient active control group . These include indicator feasibility ( accrual , adherence , compliance attrition ) , subjective objective physical fitness measure , neuropsychological performance score , self-reported cognitive symptom mental wellbeing .</detailed_description>
