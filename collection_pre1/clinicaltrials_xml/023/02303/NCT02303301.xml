	<detailed_description>When patient admit hospital already colonize oropharynx pathogen normally find commensal possible pathogen gastrointestinal tract . This probably consequence illness cause hospital admission . Most patient admit hospital elderly . Those patient often natural function regulate include ability secure airway aspiration . Acute illness whether old young lead change intestinal microbiological flora . Bacteria normally find colon distal ileum frequently appear stomach alarm oropharynx . Weakened illness , acute chronic , increase risk aspiration pathogenic bacteria oropharynx , aspiration likely induce pneumonia - health relate pneumonia . For intubated ICU patient demonstrate reduction colonization enteric bacteria apply probiotic mouth . After screen period find group patient vulnerable , randomised way give probiotic half include patient patient fill material ( maltodextrin ) . With procedure aim show reduction pathogens oropharynx secondary outcome hope see reduction pneumonia . Samples microbiological analysis take first day admission hospital specify interval .</detailed_description>
