	<detailed_description>INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN This open-label , non-blinded , randomized clinical trial investigate mortality ( 30 day ) morbidity Type A thawed Plasma ( TP ) versus NS infusion early contact , administer Emergency Medical Service ( EMS ) supervisor subject sustain severe Polytrauma / Major hemorrhage ( PTr / MH ) . The total study expect last 2 year 210 patient enrol . The two EMS agency involve study one EMS supervisor quick-response vehicle ( QRV ) equip approve , validate refrigeration unit TP transport . EMS personnel train plasma administration recognition reaction may administer 2 unit TP subject approve study enrollment . Blood sample coagulation lipid test drawn prior TP administration EMS personnel , repeat hospital personnel 30 minute , 8 hour , 24 hour post-injury . This study approve `` Exception Informed Consent '' ( EFIC ) . Once patient reach VCUMC enter VCUMC health care system , treat team advise Study Coordinator ( SC ) whether subject able consent . As plasma administration occur field prior arrival VCUMC , SC make every effort possible obtain consent subject legally authorize representative ( LAR ) continue study participation next intervention ( 8 hour blood specimen collection ) . The attempt contact LAR document detail . If subject lack ability provide his/her consent end day 30 , consent sign LAR consent document force subject 's completion study consent seek .</detailed_description>
