	<brief_title>Post-Market Study ArgusÂ® II Retinal Prosthesis System - France</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study control , prospective , multi-centre , single-arm post-market study . All data collect obtained procedure perform part routine patient case non-interventional questionnaire . Control consist three different match comparison : - Post vs. pre-implantation ( Baseline ) data . - Prospective within-subject comparison ( implant vs. non implant eye ) - Prospective subject ' visual performance Argus II System ON v Argus II System OFF . Subjects participate study undergo Baseline Visit . The Baseline Visit perform screen subject eligibility device collect study baseline assessment . Assessments include complete eye examination medical evaluation , retinal photography Optical Coherence Tomography , Ultrasound A- B-scans , photographic flash test , visual acuity test , FLORA psychosocial evaluation order ensure subject realistic expectation system . The NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaire also administer . Subjects enrol study undergo surgery Argus II device implant . Following implantation surgery , subject return clinic periodic clinical follow-up device fit . They also receive train visual rehabilitation . Clinical follow-up visit take place 1 2 week , 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 24 month post-implant . Examinations test perform baseline . In addition , patient satisfaction , Ease Use , Utilization System Questionnaire administer . Most visual function test measure conduct implanted fellow eye provide data natural course participant ' vision loss control measurements visual function . In addition , visual function test FLORA do implant eye device ON well OFF . Device Fitting refers procedure customize Video Processing Unit ( VPU ) use subject . Device Fitting typically begin one week post-implant complete approximately 4 session . Beginning approximately one month post-implant , subject receive training use Argus II System . There two phase train : system train visual rehabilitation . During system training , subject learn basic skill : connect glass VPU , change battery etc. , control eye movement RF link , scan environment head movement use different filter switch program setting . During visual rehabilitation , subject learn integrate use Argus II System everyday life . Visual rehabilitation session provide certified low-vision therapist and/or orientation mobility specialist take place clinic subject 's home .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Are adult , age 25 year old ; Have retinitis pigmentosa visual acuity bare light perception bad eye ; Have previous history useful form vision ; If subject residual light perception , retina must able respond electrical stimulation ; The subject willing provide write , inform consent participate study . Ocular disease condition could prevent Argus II work ( e.g . optic nerve disease , central retinal artery vein occlusion , history retinal detachment , trauma , severe strabismus , etc . ) ; Ocular structure condition could prevent successful implantation Argus II Implant adequate healing surgery ( e.g . extremely thin conjunctiva ; axial length &lt; 20.5 mm &gt; 26 mm ; corneal ulcer ; choroidal neovascularization area intend tack location , etc . ) ; Ocular disease condition ( cataract ) prevent adequate visualization inner structure eye ( e.g . corneal opacity ) ; Predisposition eye rub ; Any disease condition prevents understand communication inform consent , study demand , test protocol , include : cognitive decline include diagnosed form dementia and/or progressive neurologic disease , psychiatric disease include diagnose form depression ; speak principal language associate region , deafness selective frequency hear loss prevents hear device alarm alert ; Pregnant wish become pregnant course study ; Participating another investigational drug device study may conflict objective , followup test study ; Conditions likely limit life less 1 year time inclusion ; At time Baseline Visit , suffer nonophthalmic serious adverse event ( e.g . coma , myocardial infarction , etc. ) .
