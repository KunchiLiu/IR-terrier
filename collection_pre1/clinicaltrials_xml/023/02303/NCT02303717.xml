	<brief_summary>A prospective , randomize , multicenter study patient indication coronary artery revascularisation accept percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) leave main coronary artery . Patients undergo standard PCI leave main coronary artery randomize 1:1 fashion Synergy stent XIENCE stent . Dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) stop t=4 month Synergy arm whereas control arm DAPT continue 12 month . A subgroup 100 patient control angiography Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) t=3 month treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PCI leave main coronary artery complex procedure increase risk short long-term major cardiac adverse event . With use coronary artery stent outcome significant improve PCI leave main included European Society Cardiology guideline [ 8 ] . However result first generation drug elute stent still show significant room improvement , risk late stent thrombosis show accrue 5 year follow-up . The new generation drug elute stent improve radial strength thinner strut thickness , bioresorbable coating local drug delivery resorb 3 month apply direct vessel wall . These stent evaluate non-complex disease good result . A comparison new generation drug elute stent combination short duration dual antiplatelet therapy versus current standard PCI techniques complex PCI leave main coronary artery disease therefore desirable . The study stent ( Synergy ) evolution currently use drug elute stent initial trial demonstrate similar result surrogate endpoint [ 4,5 ] On clinical endpoint difference demonstrate . This result small possibility inferiority current stent re-intervention large risk . For shorten DAPT several non-randomized study show high safety low risk ( 1 % ) stent thrombosis [ 6 ] . Based improved property study stent ( biodegradable coating ) risk early DAPT discontinuation minimal . For relevant subgroup control coronary angiography additional use OCT imaging consider standard procedure low risk major complication ( 0.4 % ) [ 7 ] This study investigate short term angiographic long term clinical outcome implantation improve drug elute coronary artery stent ( Everolimus-eluting Platinum Chromium Stent Abluminal Bioabsorbable Polymer ) short post interventional dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) comparison conventional drug elute stent permanent Polymer follow 12 month DAPT treatment unprotected leave main coronary artery disease .</detailed_description>
