	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose selinexor give together ibrutinib treat patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma return period improvement respond treatment . Drugs use chemotherapy , selinexor , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving selinexor together ibrutinib may better treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selinexor Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose combination selinexor ibrutinib patient relapse refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) /small lymphocytic leukemia ( SLL ) /B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia ( PLL ) aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety tolerability combination selinexor ibrutinib patient relapse refractory CLL/SLL/PLL aggressive NHL . II . To characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) property combination selinexor ibrutinib patient relapse refractory CLL/SLL/PLL aggressive NHL . III . To obtain preliminary evidence efficacy combination selinexor ibrutinib patient relapse refractory CLL/SLL/PLL aggressive NHL . IV . To obtain preliminary evidence response CLL/SLL/PLL diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) patient receive combination selinexor ibrutinib relate CLL/SLL/PLL karyotype immunoglobulin variable heavy chain ( IgVH ) mutational status DLBCL subtype , respectively . V. To evaluate inhibition B-cell receptor signal pathway patient relapse refractory CLL/SLL/PLL receive combination selinexor ibrutinib . VI . To evaluate change localization tumor suppressor growth regulation proteins patient relapse refractory CLL/SLL/PLL follow treatment selinexor general relate response . VII . To preliminarily assess potential cause primary secondary resistance selinexor ibrutinib . VIII . To measure intracellular level selinexor metabolites peripheral blood mononuclear cell identify relate pharmacodynamics effect clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study selinexor . Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) day 8-28 course 1 day 1-28 subsequent course selinexor PO twice daily ( BID ) weekly day 1 bi-weekly day 1 3 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
