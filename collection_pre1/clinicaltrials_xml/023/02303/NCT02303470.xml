	<brief_title>Vigorous Exercise Versus Moderate Exercise Improve Glucose Metabolism Metabolic Parameters Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Insulin Resistance : A Prospective Randomized Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) common endocrine disorder incidence 5-8 % reproductive age woman . PCOS characterize collection sign symptom , define 2003 Rotterdam criterion must include two follow three characteristic : oligo-ovulation anovulation , polycystic-appearing ovary , clinical biochemical evidence elevate androgen . Women PCOS also know increase risk metabolic disorder , include insulin resistance , obesity , cardiovascular disease , hyperlipidemia . It show many sequela PCOS improve intervention reduce insulin level . Previous research demonstrate weight reduction metformin beneficial restore normal ovulation pattern fertility improve hyperandrogenemia hyperlipidemia . Studies effect lifestyle modification woman PCOS show exercise , alone combination change diet , improve ovulation rate metabolic parameter , associate reduce incidence insulin resistance . As , care PCOS patient often include counsel regard reduce dietary intake improvement physical fitness . However , type exercise evaluate inconsistent many study vary intensity , frequency duration . Therefore , exercise need achieve health benefit PCOS well define . The Department Health Human Services ( DHHS ) recommend Americans get least 150 minute per week moderate aerobic exercise least 75 minute per week vigorous aerobic activity maintain health fitness Americans . A critical unanswered question whether one option ( moderate versus vigorous ) provide superior benefit woman PCOS . High-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) form exercise combine short interval vigorous exercise lower intensity recovery period . HIIT use train modality high-performance athlete decade . More recently , study therapeutic purpose adult cardiovascular disease , obesity , metabolic syndrome . These data suggest compare moderate exercise , HIIT show great improvement aerobic capacity , maximal oxygen consumption , index insulin resistance , hyperglycemia , lipid profile . HIIT also compare moderate-intensity exercise patient type 2 diabetes show reduction hyperglycemia , though data controversial . HIIT study specifically patient PCOS . Studies employ structure exercise program often high drop-out rate poor post-study continuation rate . An exercise program require fitness facility equipment may create barrier patient compliance . Additionally , time constraint often cite reason patient drop-out . Our goal create effective exercise program complete around home , require 15-30 minute per day . Participants randomize either 15 minute vigorous exercise ( HIIT ) 30 minute moderate exercise ( brisk walking ) perform 5 day per week 8 week . Exercise training perform exercise physiologist participant complete exercise program independently , use heart rate monitoring exercise diary record exercise intensity . This study evaluate feasibility exercise plan term patient compliance safety . We also evaluate effect short-duration , vigorous exercise versus longer-duration , moderate exercise secondary outcome insulin resistance metabolic parameter .</detailed_description>
