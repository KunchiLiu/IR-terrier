	<detailed_description>This Phase I study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) D2C7-IT , deliver intratumorally convection-enhanced delivery ( CED ) follow confirmatory diagnostic biopsy recurrent World Health Organization ( WHO ) grade III IV malignant glioma patient , determine dose consider phase II trial . A two-stage continual reassessment method ( CRM ) design use determine MTD D2C7-IT first stage involve dose escalation successive patient initial dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) observe . Within second stage , accumulate data use within context one-parameter logistic model determine appropriate dose subsequent patient . Maximum likelihood estimation use . This modeling process determine dose DLT rate close target DLT rate 0.25 . Cohorts 2 patient accrue study within stage trial . The first patient cohort observe completion D2C7-IT infusion , additional patient cohort treat . Once optimal dose level D2C7-IT determine ( dose escalation complete ) , total 27 recurrent patient WHO grade IV malignant glioma patient treat dose level dose expansion cohort . Patients diagnose recurrent malignant glioma base radiographic evidence may enrol onto study prior biopsy . The clinically approve BrainLab iPlan Flow ( BrainLAB AG , Feldkirchen , Germany ) plan station software use biopsy catheter placement base magnetic resonance ( MR ) image . In brief , simulation spread drug tracer molecule compute FDA-approved computer algorithm base standard equation present Morrison et al , use data derive MR diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) dynamic contrast enhanced ( DCE ) image provide information useful determination ( ) advection ( convection ) , ( ii ) diffusion ( iii ) loss interstitium due clearance due vasculature metabolism degradation . Up four intratumoral catheter place area great risk infiltrate disease solid-contrast-enhancing disease . Catheter placement base BrainLab software . A computed tomography ( CT ) scan use confirm catheter placement postoperatively . Catheters find postoperative CT scan improperly place may replace remove . If frozen section biopsy indicate proven diagnosis recurrent WHO Grade III IV malignant glioma ( diagnosis result typically receive within 24-48 hour follow biopsy ) , investigator proceed D2C7-IT infusion . If , catheter remove . Molecular genetic test , , limit , DNA sequencing , gene amplification , gene expression , perform tissue obtain biopsy . The goal molecular genetic test identify genetic predictor response failure response treatment D2C7-IT . A continuous intratumoral infusion D2C7-IT administer Neurosciences Step unit Duke . Based experience , previously publish report Laske , et al ( 1997 ) 31 , Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) - FDA-approved trial use similar infusion technique , patient infuse rate 0.5 ml/hour . The total flow rate catheter set 0.5 ml/hour per catheter 72 hour . Up total volume 144 mL administer . Patients take ( stable ) less equal 4 mg per day dexamethasone ( i.e . low-dose corticosteroid ) within 2 week prior admission D2C7-IT infusion ( i.e . patient meet relevant eligibility criterion ) may continue dose . Patients take corticosteroid medical indication ( e.g. , asthma skin condition ) advise continue use medication . Any neurologic finding prompt increase corticosteroid dose documented Adverse Events . Seizure prophylaxis administer patient prior , , infusion afterward . Seizure prophylaxis may administer patient prior , , infusion discretion treat neuro-surgeon . Prophylactic antiepileptic medication may also continue visit 1 month post infusion . Choice antiepileptic medication discontinuation medication visit 1 month post infusion leave discretion neurosurgeon neuro-oncologist . Any neurologic finding prompt increase antiepileptic medication dose document Adverse Event . This study limit administration high-dose corticosteroid due concern high-dose corticosteroid might negatively impact efficacy D2C7-IT . Specifically , high-dose corticosteroid may administer limited basis patient prior , , D2C7-IT infusion determine medically necessary . Gd-DTPA ( gadolinium-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid ) co-infused along D2C7-IT monitor infusate distribution . MR mages obtain within 24-30 hour start infusion 0 6 hour end infusion , catheter removal , monitor volume drug distribution . The radiographic imaging perform catheter placement , completion infusion , also use safety measure toxicity monitoring determine degree leakage cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . The patient remain hospital entire infusion . At completion infusion , catheter remove within 6 hour CT scan obtain catheter pull . The patient observe hospital minimum another 6 hour . Blood drawn determine immune response tumor antigen generate D2C7-IT infusion . Following D2C7-IT infusion , subject evaluate clinic 2 week adverse event follow 4 8 week every 8 week thereafter 48 week disease progression , whichever occur first , adverse event , radiographic response , Health Related Quality Life ( HRQoL ) cognitive function ( 8-week , 16-week , 32-week , 48-week assessment ) . No treatment intervention allowable study . Subjects come study progressive disease document . If alternative anti-tumor therapy initiate patient undergoes surgical procedure due disease progression , date type therapy/surgery must document ; however , subject study progressive disease document . Subjects follow survival imaging , available .</detailed_description>
