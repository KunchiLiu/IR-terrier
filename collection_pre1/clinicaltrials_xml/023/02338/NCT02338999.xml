	<brief_summary>Background : - Lupus cause person immune system attack body . It cause blood vessel problem , heart attack , stroke . Researchers want see drug pioglitazone may help . Objectives : - To see well pioglitazone improves blood vessel function decrease blood vessel inflammation . To study effect lupus symptom . Eligibility : - Adults least 18 year old lupus . Design : - Participants screen medical history , heart test , blood urine test . They may bone density test . - Visit 1 : - Participants : - Physical exam blood drawn . - Peripheral Arterial Tonometry ( Endopat ) . A cup place finger pressure cuff arm . - Cardio-ankle vascular index ( CAVI ) and/or Sphygmocor . Electrodes place wrist , microphone chest , blood pressure cuff arm leg . Another test involve place small device fingertip . - 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography/computerized tomography ( PET/CT ) ( participant ) . A radioactive sugar inject small plastic tube arm vein . Participants lie bed move scanner take picture . - Participants get 3-month-supply study drug placebo . After 1 week , dose may increase . - After 3 month , take either drug 8 week . Then switch take drug 3 month . - Participants 6 visit 8 month Visit 1 . Tests Visit 1 may repeat . They may urine test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role PPAR-y Agonists Immunomodulation Vascular Prevention SLE ( PPAR-SLE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) autoimmune disease unclear cause affect primarily woman childbearing age . Patients lupus significantly increase risk develop complication blood vessel due accelerate harden artery ( atherosclerosis ) . These complication include heart attack stroke . No drug date prove prevent type complication lupus premature vascular disease significantly impact quality life patient enhance risk death . The thiazolidinediones ( TZD ) class drug approve treatment patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) ; belong family drug activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPAR-gamma ) . They propose strong anti-atherogenic anti-inflammatory effect even patient without diabetes . Recent work group others indicate TZDs significantly improve vascular damage , dysfunction blood vessel disease activity mouse model lupus abrogate atherosclerosis . We recently identify TZD pioglitazone effective drug modulation vascular function disease activity patient rheumatoid arthritis . In addition , find mouse model lupus vitro experiment human lupus cell , pioglitazone important role modulate immune function vascular manifestation . Furthermore , drug immunosuppressive , add additional advantage compare medication use disease . We propose TZDs could significantly improve blood vessel function play role atherosclerosis prevention human SLE , addition modify lupus disease activity . The major goal propose research ass effect PPAR-gamma agonist pioglitazone SLE vascular function inflammation SLE disease activity . The result study may lead characterization new therapeutic target dual effect lupus associate blood vessel damage</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . For female male 18 year old old : female adequate contraception childbearing potential , documented clinician , unless patient spouse/partner ( ) previously undergone sterilization procedure . Adequate contraception consider : Intrauterine device ( IUD ) , Hormone implant , Injectable contraceptive , Oral contraceptives plus barrier method ( male condom , female condom diaphragm ) , Abstinence , A vasectomized partner . 2 . Meet revise ACR criterion 2012 SLICC criterion SLE : ) baseline SLEDAI2K great equal 4 &lt; 20 clinical SLEDAI2K great equal 2 ( consider antidsDNA complement level ) b ) lack BILAG A flare baseline . 3 . Stable dos immunosuppressant and/or antimalarial least 3 month , and/or corticosteroid least 2 week . If statin , stable dos least 6 month . 4 . Allowed concomitant lupusrelated medication Antimalarials , Prednisone &lt; 20mg daily equivalent dos corticosteroid ; Immunosuppressants : Mycophenolate mofetil , 3000 mg/day , Methotrexate , 30 mg/week , Azathioprine , 3 mg/kg/day , Leflunomide , 20 mg/day , Cyclosporine , 5 mg/kg/day Tacrolimus , 0.1 mg/kg/day NSAIDS aspirin Note : While would highly desirable maintain corticosteroid dosage constant level trial duration , impractical anticipate patient active SLE maintain without therapy modification 8month period . Because corticosteroid acceptable agent treatment vast majority minor lupus flare , patient major flare ( BILAG 2004 A recent change medication ) exclude , provide standardize treatment across study population easily analyze . An increase prednisone dose &lt; 10 mg/day prednisone dose study entry permit trial increase disease activity standardize taper allowable small monthly decrement patient baseline dose 5 mg/day , whichever less . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Pregnant lactate woman 2 . Expected need major surgery trial . 3 . Current previous diagnosis malignant disease , except basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin complete excision clear border adequately treat situ carcinoma cervix . 4 . Acute infection identify screen require antibiotic . These subject would eligible participate follow resolution rescreening . 5 . Chronic infection hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HIV Tuberculosis . 6 . Current use cyclophosphamide receive cyclophosphamide within last year . 7 . Prior history hemorrhagic cystitis hematuria receive cyclophosphamide could explain cause . 8 . Current use ( within 3 month ) tocilizumab , rituximab , belimumab , intravenous gammaglobulin biologic . 9 . History poor compliance medical care , study visit and/or medication use . 10 . Receipt investigational new drug device within 30 day prior screen 5 halflives agent &lt; TAB &gt; ( whichever longer ) , investigational new drug know longterm effect . 11 . Pioglitazone recommend patient symptomatic heart failure . Patients current heart failure ( NYHA class II , III IV ) and/or leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 45 % echocardiogram screening exclude . 12 . Significant impairment major organ function ( lung , heart , liver , kidney ) condition , opinion Investigator , would jeopardize subject safety follow exposure study drug . 13 . Known hypersensitivity TZDs 14 . Serum hepatic transaminase level &gt; 2 time upper normal limit , clinical evidence active liver disease screening . The exception patient confirm nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) pioglitazone report therapeutic role . 15 . Diagnosis DM meeting DM criterion screen visit , establish new classification criterion : Patients diabetes excluded diabetes induce profound change endothelial function want ass effect PPAR agonists vascular risk beyond change insulin resistance . 16 . Known latex allergy EndoPAT test 17 . Patients severe Raynaud 's phenomenon , history finger ulcer finger gangrene . 18 . Patients severe SLE baseline , quantify SLEDAI2K &gt; 20 . 19 . Patients active lupus nephritis active CNS lupus baseline even SLEDAI2K &lt; 20 . Active disease consider CNS renal disease require aggressive immunosuppression . Active CNS disease diagnose base clinical presentation physical exam , exclusion condition could explain symptomatology , warrant , ancillary test ( image ) support diagnosis . Patients induction therapy lupus nephritis chronic ( 6 month ) , stable proteinuria &lt; 750 mg/gram protein : creatinine ratio otherwise consider evidence active lupus nephritis ( e.g . cellular cast stable serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL ) last 6 month , include study . In selected patient potentially confound clinical factor , consults request help clarify nature underlying renal disease may affect inclusion . 20 . Postmenopausal woman undergone DEXA scan last year undergo DEXA scan screening . Patients well 2.5 included . Postmenopausal woman undergone DEXA scan last year T score well 2.5 include without repeat DEXA scan prior enrollment . If T score bad 2.5 , exclude participate unless subject willing begin appropriate treatment osteoporosis Visit Day 1 . Postmenopausal woman undergone DEXA scan last year , T score bad 2.5 bisphosphonates appropriate therapy exclude .</criteria>
