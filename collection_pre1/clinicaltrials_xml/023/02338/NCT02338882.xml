	<brief_summary>During cataract surgery artificial lens implant eye . These artificial lens call intraocular lens ( IOLs ) many different type IOL design . IOLs fixed focus unless multifocal IOL use would need wear spectacle view near object . This study design look well multifocal IOL corrects distance near vision comparison conventional monofocal IOL . Both type IOLs commercially available commonly implant . Using new non-invasive method hope able good judge visual performance IOLs . In addition study involve image examining IOLs determine prevalence post-operative complication .</brief_summary>
