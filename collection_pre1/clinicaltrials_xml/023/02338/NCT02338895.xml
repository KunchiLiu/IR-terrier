	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND &amp; INTRODUCTION : Acute Kidney Injury ( AKI ) develop 88 % 30 % critically ill patient admit intensive care unit . While AKI severity strong predictor mortality ( 1-4 ) , morbidity mortality increase increase severity renal injury ( 2 ) . Therefore management strategy prevent progression renal risk injury failure potential improve outcomes patient . Conventional management acute oliguria shock blindly 'push ' fluid improve renal perfusion give loop diuretic fluid load consider accomplished . However volume overload 'blind ' attempt fluid removal worsen renal injury associate high mortality venous overcongestion ( 5 ) inappropriate hypovolemia ( 6-8 ) . It seem reasonable assume bedside test visualize volume status renal perfusion may assist improve outcome cohort . Intensive care unit ( ICU ) bedside ultrasound become standard care critically ill patient ( 9-18 ) . In patient shock , inferior vena cava ultrasonographic evaluation 'fluid responsiveness ' routinely use direct resuscitation ( 19-21 ) direct measurement IVC diameter respiratory variation response noninvasive fluid bolus passive leg raise ( 22 ) . Doppler ultrasound intrarenal vessel also describe tool assess renal perfusion ( 23-27 ) . The investigator develop goal-directed ultrasonographic protocol provide immediate hemodynamic information acutely oliguric patient shock well management algorithm guide therapy . The investigator incorporate IVC diameter measurement , respiratory variation response passive leg raise ass whether fluid bolus require measurement renal perfusion determine whether diuretic renal replacement therapy indicate . The objective measure effect management protocol rate AKI study participant compare prior implementation protocol . METHODS : 1 . Study Design : Prospective , Observational 2 . Study Patients : - Inclusion criterion : Critically ill , adult patient AND acute oliguric renal failure AND within 6 hour presentation - Exclusion criterion : . Patients pre-existing chronic renal failure ii . Patients renal replacement therapy/ Dialysis iii . Patients poor sonographic window 3 . Variables measure : - Dependent variable : a. Demographic identifier ; age , gender , comorbidity , admit diagnosis , APACHE II score , b. Renal perfusion measure color Doppler c. Daily fluid balance , d. Mean hourly urine output , e. Vasopressor use , f. Daily serum Creatinine g. Response diuretic h. Dose diuretic result urine output - Outcome variable : 1 . Incidence renal failure ( classified RIFLE category ; Risk , Injury , Failure , Loss Function , End-Stage : see Appendix 1 ) , 2 . ICU length Stay , 3 . ICU mortality Materials &amp; Methodologies : 1 . Screening &amp; Enrollment patient : 1 . All ICU patient admit ICU screen enrollment . 2 . Those meeting inclusion criterion Demographic information enter Case Record Forms ( Appendix 2 : Sample CRF ) 3 . Ultrasound examination carry result enter CRF . For patient find intravascularly dehydrate ( &gt; 2 cm IVC diameter ( IVCd ) &gt; 15 % variation IVCd increase &gt; 15 % IVCd passive leg raise maneuver ) , result communicate manage ICU team fluid resuscitation - For patient find adequately hydrate , renal perfusion assess observe flow interlobar arcuate vessel colour Doppler renal resistive index measure . - The result perfusion perfusion present communicate manage ICU team recommendation high dose diuresis 2 . Ultrasonographic assessment Inferior Vena Cava Measurement inferior vena cava diameter , respiratory variation ultrasound ( http : //www.criticalecho.com/content/tutorial-4-volume-status-and-preload-responsiveness-assessment ) Ultrasonographic assessment IVC do use transthoracic , subcostal approach . The transducer position xiphisternum 1-2cms right midline , marker dot point towards sternal notch . After obtain 2-D image IVC enter right atrium verify IVC visualization lose movement respiration , M-mode line place IVC 1 cm caudal junction hepatic vein , M-mode tracing obtain . This placement ensure intrathoracic IVC measure part respiratory cycle . The M-mode tracing record 3- 4 respiratory cycle , image frozen use caliper , maximum minimum diameter IVC tracing measure . IVC variation quantify measure difference maximum minimum diameter M-mode tracing . Ultrasonographic assessment Renal Perfusion color Doppler Vessel localization semi-quantitative evaluation renal perfusion carry use follow stag method . ( http : //link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007 % 2F978-3-642-10286-8_31 - page-1 ) Stage Quality Renal Perfusion color Doppler 0 Unidentifiable vessel 1 Few vessel vicinity hilum 2 Hilar intralobar vessel renal parenchyma 3 Renal vessel identifiable arcuate artery entire field view 3 . Statistical Methods : 1 . Sample size &amp; Sampling : Consecutive admission ICU enrol . Since proof concept study , project sample size 40 patient . An interim analysis carry 20 patient enrol 20 enrol necessary 2 . Analysis : Categorical variable report proportion percentage , continuous variable mean median . Differences group estimate use CHI2 , student test Mann-Whitney U test , appropriate . Rates renal injury historical control compare rate measure use test pair sample . A p value =0.05 consider significant . SPSS version 22.0 use analysis . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS : 1 . Informed Consent ultrasonographic examination . The use use ultrasound assessment management critically ill patient ICU emergency room consider standard care routinely practice ICUs around world . Since ultrasound evaluation become incorporated usual ICU practice , write consent require routine use . We therefore ask waiver inform consent since perform deviation usual ICU care study simply collection practice protocolized form . ( Please see References 9-27 ) 2 . Research Advisory Committee ( RAC ) Review This protocol review approved hospital Research Advisory committee responsible oversight study . 2 . Subject Confidentiality &amp; Protection Rights Control Subjects All case record form , report record identify Study Identification Number ( SID ) maintain subject confidentiality . All record keep password-protected file . All computer entry network program do use SIDs . 3 . Study Modification/Discontinuation The study may modify discontinued time primary investigator Research Advisory Committee part duty ensure research subject protect .</detailed_description>
