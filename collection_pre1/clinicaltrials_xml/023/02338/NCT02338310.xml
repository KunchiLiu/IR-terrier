	<brief_summary>To determine whether perioperative endocrine therapy aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) follow standard adjuvant therapy improve outcome compare standard adjuvant therapy alone postmenopausal woman hormone receptor positive breast cancer . To determine whether proliferation marker Ki67 measure immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) excise cancer around 2 week start AI therapy predict time recurrence ( TTR ) individual patient effectively pre-treatment Ki67 value . To determine whether molecular profile 2 week start endocrine therapy predict long-term outcome postmenopausal woman hormone receptor positive breast cancer good diagnosis .</brief_summary>
