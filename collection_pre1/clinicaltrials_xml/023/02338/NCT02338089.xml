	<brief_summary>Postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) lead cause maternal morbidity mortality worldwide cause commonly poor uterine muscle ( myometrium ) tone delivery . The first line agent use prevention treatment PPH oxytocin . Women require augmentation labor intravenous oxytocin inadequate labor progression show increase risk PPH . Typically , augmentation labor , oxytocin use continuous infusion , consensus initial dose , increment maximal limit . High concentration continuous oxytocin infusion without risk , include hyperstimulation , fetal distress , well uterine rupture . Studies show clinical benefit pulsatile oxytocin delivery labor induction augmentation regard requirement less total oxytocin , similar uterine contractility similar rate caesarean delivery use labor induction augmentation . However , rate PPH primary outcome measure investigate . Therefore currently know effect pulsatile oxytocin delivery rate PPH . The investigator hypothesize effect myometrial desensitization follow pulsatile oxytocin exposure would lower compare continuous oxytocin exposure . These result help establish whether myometrial contractility sensitivity oxytocin good preserve delivery pulsatile oxytocin , rather continuous oxytocin labor induction augmentation , thereby result less PPH .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Effect Pulsatile Administration Oxytocin Desensitization Human Myometrium In-vitro</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Typically labor augment exposure high level continuous oxytocin , prolong period . The increased incidence uterine atony PPH follow exogenous oxytocin administration labor augmentation relate myometrial oxytocin receptor desensitization oxytocin . Human clinical trial show benefit pulsatile oxytocin administration labor induction augmentation , include requirement less total oxytocin , similar uterine contractility similar rate cesarean delivery . However , outcome effect PPH currently know . Characterization effect pulsatile oxytocin desensitization myometrium compare effect continuous oxytocin , may provide guidance delivery pulsatile oxytocin labor induction augmentation protect otherwise high risk PPH . Furthermore , delivery pulsatile oxytocin may consider subgroup already high risk PPH , require labor augmentation . The investigator ' previously validate in-vitro model provide solid foundation study myometrial contractility control condition , without confounders could encounter clinical setting . The result study provide insight level desensitization human myometrium follow exposure pulsatile oxytocin . Based oxytocin dose-response curve pretreatment continuous oxytocin pretreatment pulsatile oxytocin , able determine extent desensitize myometrium follow delivery method .</detailed_description>
