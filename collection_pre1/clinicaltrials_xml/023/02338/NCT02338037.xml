	<brief_summary>This pilot trial study brain concentration eribulin mesylate treat patient primary metastatic brain tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , eribulin mesylate , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Collecting small sample brain fluid may help determine well eribulin mesylate concentrate brain tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine neuropharmacokinetic ( nPK ) profile eribulin ( eribulin mesylate ) use intracerebral microdialysis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare concentration eribulin tumor ( enhance tissue ) normal brain ( non-enhancing tissue ) technically feasible place two microdialysis catheter study patient . II . To describe intracerebral clinical benefit ( define stable disease , partial response , complete response ) eribulin study patient continue treat eribulin complete microdialysis portion study . III . To document toxicity eribulin cohort patient . OUTLINE : Patients undergo tumor resection biopsy microdialysis catheter place day 0 . Beginning least 24 hour later , patient receive eribulin mesylate intravenously ( IV ) 2-5 minute day 1 . Serial brain fluid sample collect approximately 72 hour microdialysis catheter remove . Beginning least 2 week tumor resection biopsy , patient may continue receive eribulin mesylate IV 2-5 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
