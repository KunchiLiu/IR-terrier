	<detailed_description>Patients admit ICU may delay awaken critical illness resolve . Though either due metabolic cause delay elimination sedative medication , serious pathology intracranial hemorrhage , ischemic stroke , vasogenic edema may also cause coma . These pathology result increase intracranial pressure ( ICP ) cerebral edema . At stage , usual workup include brain CT scan , MRI EEG . These test require transport patient ICU Radiology department , process may possible unstable , critically ill patient . Identifying elevate intracranial pressure elevation far , rely invasive monitoring technique require placement intracranial intraventricular catheter . The optic nerve attache globe posteriorly wrap sheath contain cerebrospinal fluid . The optic nerve sheath contiguous dura mater trabeculated arachnoid space cerebrospinal fluid slowly percolate . Pressure increase around brain therefore transmit around optic nerve increase diameter optic nerve sheath . This optic nerve sheath diameter ( ONSD ) describe highly sensitive ( 88-94 % ) specific ( 85 % - 94 % ) noninvasive technique identify increase intracranial pressure patient brain trauma , intracranial bleed stroke [ 1-4 ] . This method require placement ultrasound probe patient 's closed eyelid direct measurement diameter optic nerve sheath pre-specified distance globe . A value great 58 mm show correlate significantly increase ICP ( &gt; 20 cm H20 ) ; r = 0.71 , p &lt; 0.001 [ 5 ] . We hypothesize bedside ultrasound measurement ONSD simple screen test increase intracranial pressure use rapidly efficiently identify patient ICU coma due increase intracranial pressure . Objectives : To determine role bedside ONSD measurement ultrasound evaluation comatose patient ICU . METHODS : - Study Design : Prospective , Observational study - Study Sample : - Inclusion criterion : Consecutive , adult patient already admit critical care service cause coma determine . - Exclusion criterion : obvious ocular trauma , patient sedative narcotic infusion . Variables measure : Independent variable : Demographic identifier ; age , gender , comorbidity , admit diagnosis , APACHE II score , SAPS II score Dependent ( Outcome ) variable : 1 . Diagnosis cerebral edema/ elevate intracranial pressure measure Optic nerve sheath diameter 2 . Diagnosis cerebral edema/ elevate intracranial pressure measure neuroimaging 3 . ICU mortality Materials &amp; Methodologies : 1 . Screening &amp; Enrollment patient : 1 . All ICU patient screen enrollment . 2 . For patient meet inclusion criterion , inform consent obtain patient family member bedside . 3 . Demographic information collect Case Record Forms ( Appendix 2 : Sample CRF ) 4 . Ultrasound examination carry result enter CRF . 2 . Technique ONSD ultrasound measurement Reference 6 . - A high resolution 7.5 -10 MHz linear array ultrasound transducer probe use . A large amount standard water-soluble ultrasound transmission gel apply patient 's closed eyelid . The globe scan transverse plane . - The ONSD measure predefined point 3 mm posterior globe eye . - Measurement ONSD eye do average two measurement take . - A value &gt; 58mm ( reference 1 ) consider indicative increase ICP primary ICU team inform rapid measure decrease ICP urgent image CNS . 3 . Statistical Methods : 1 . Sample size &amp; Sampling : Consecutive admission ICU enrol . Since proof concept study , project sample size 40 patient . An interim analysis carry 20 patient enrol 20 enrol necessary 2 . Analysis : Categorical variable report proportion percentage , continuous variable mean median . Differences group estimate use CHI2 , student test Mann-Whitney U test , appropriate . A p value =0.05 consider significant . SPSS version 22.0 use analysis . Ethical consideration : - Informed Consent ultrasonographic examination . The use use ultrasound assessment management critically ill patient ICU emergency room consider standard care routinely practice ICUs around world . Since ultrasound evaluation become incorporated usual ICU practice , write consent require routine use . We therefore ask waiver inform consent since perform deviation usual ICU care study simply collection practice protocolized form . - Research Advisory Committee ( RAC ) Review This protocol review approved hospital Research Advisory committee responsible oversight study . 2 . Subject Confidentiality &amp; Protection Rights Control Subjects All case record form , report record identify Study Identification Number ( SID ) maintain subject confidentiality . All record keep password-protected file . All computer entry network program do use SIDs . 3 . Study Modification/Discontinuation The study may modify discontinued time primary investigator Research Advisory Committee part duty ensure research subject protect .</detailed_description>
