	<brief_summary>Petrolatum well-known emollient use since 1800 's . Not use help dry skin , also market substance protects minor cut burn . In past thought inferior topical antibiotic infection prevention cutaneous wound . However , 1996 large , multicenter trial include 900 patient show petrolatum safe effective topical antibiotic , bacitracin prevent infection patient undergo dermatological surgery . In trial , petrolatum group similarly low rate infection , group also report case contact dermatitis . Aside expensive petrolatum , bacitracin topical antimicrobial ( i.e . neomycin ) know common culprit contact dermatitis . In study do North American Contact Dermatitis Group 2005-2006 , 9.2 10 % 4,000 patient patch test allergic reaction either bacitracin neomycin , respectively . For reason , clear petrolatum appeal alternative topical antibiotic infection prevention patient undergoing dermatological procedure . This study however lack mechanistic analysis provide molecular insight petrolatum effective infection prevention . The aim research study effect petrolatum innate immune reaction skin . In particular , petrolatum 's effect various antimicrobial peptide contact skin 3 day examine . This do immunohistochemistry various cellular infiltrates well mRNA gene expression via RT-PCR analysis inflammatory AMP gene . Tissue sample petrolatum occlude skin compare healthy skin skin occlusion alone control . These comparison isolate effect petrolatum skin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Petrolatum ( also commonly call Vaseline ) well know moisturizer use since 1800 's . Not use help dry skin , also market substance protects minor cut burn . It widely use Dermatologists substance apply wound cutaneous surgical procedure . In large study , petrolatum show effective one major topical antibiotic help prevent infection patient underwent dermatologic procedure . Not topical antibiotic expensive , also commonly cause allergic reaction 10 % population . Until , reason find explain petrolatum effective infection prevention . In recent study , skin biopsy skin petrolatum apply obtain . Upon analysis certain `` antimicrobial peptide '' ( peptide possess anti-bacterial property help fight infection ) find elevate . This could provide answer petrolatum effective topical antibiotic study mention . This study hop improve understand immune system act skin responds petrolatum . In order reach goal , normal volunteer , patch test petrolatum . Then , biopsy take skin site petrolatum . Also , small biopsy take area receive patch petrolatum area receive patch serve control . The biopsied skin sample study laboratory method immunohistochemistry RT-PCR analysis , help define response immune system petrolatum . The rationale study well define petrolatum 's effect skin effective preventing infection .</detailed_description>
