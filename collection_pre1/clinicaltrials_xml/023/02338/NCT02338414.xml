	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate efficacy romiplostim administer every week ITP patient attain stable platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L 4 consecutive week weekly dos romiplostim .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Observational Study Evaluate Efficacy Biweekly Romiplostim Adult Patients With ITP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regarding determination appropriate dose , well know romiplostim result dose-dependent increase platelet count , require dose raise platelet count variable individual accord patient 's ability eliminate serum romiplostim . Because variability , administration initial 1mcg/kg romiplostim , dose adjustment recommend base platelet response give dose romiplostim . However , optimal dose interval romiplostim rarely study . In pivotal study , romiplostim administer weekly schedule , base study , one dose every week widely use . In one study ITP patient receive weekly subcutaneous dos romiplostim range 3 15mcg/kg , half life romiplostim estimate 1 34 day , suggest lengthen interval dos week potentially possible patient .</detailed_description>
