	<brief_title>Defining Exposure Target Weekly Paclitaxel Infusion Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paclitaxel chemotherapeutic agent commonly use various tumor type . Paclitaxel efficacy toxicity `` dose-dependent '' mean increase dose increase treatment efficacy occurrence toxicity . When used weekly 1-hour infusion regimen paclitaxel commonly associate treatment-limiting sensory peripheral neuropathy . At current standard dose 80 mg/m2 approximately 20-25 % patient experience treatment-limiting neuropathy . Drug exposure , dose , determine treatment efficacy neuropathy development . When treated standard dose substantial variability drug exposure meaning patient receive less efficacious treatment optimal . At time monitor patient 's exposure optimal exposure level define . The purpose study prospectively enroll patient systematic collection exposure neuropathy data order characterize relationship . Once relationship cumulative exposure neuropathy characterize , model use define exposure target future prospective exposure-guided dose-adjustment trial .</detailed_description>
