	<detailed_description>One controversial area cardiac surgery whether off-pump coronary artery bypass graft ( OPCAB ) surgery superior conventional on-pump coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery . There ongoing debate benefit disadvantage OPCAB . Initial trial show OPCAB feasible select low-risk patient offer result similar CABG . In institution experience OPCAB , rate major adverse event rate complete revascularization graft patency similar CABG . These positive result call question report inferior graft patency high rate repeat target-vessel revascularization associate OPCAB . The Randomized On/Off Bypass ( ROOBY ) trial show among low-risk patient , rate death major adverse event 30 day surgery similar OPCAB CABG , OPCAB associate high rate incomplete revascularization 1 year . Short-term mortality morbidity OPCAB CABG similar recent trial involve 4752 patient mixed operative-risk profile CABG Off On Pump Revascularization Study ( CORONARY ) . The German Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Elderly Patients ( GOPCABE ) study focus exclusively patient ≥ 75 year . However , trial would n't elucidate potential benefit OPCAB high-risk patient specific group Germans patient moderate-risk patient . The result Best Bypass Surgery Trial ( BBS ) , perform 341 high-risk patient ( European system cardiac operative risk evaluation `` EuroSCORE '' &gt; 5 ) undergo CABG OPCAB , report significant difference composite adverse cardiac cerebrovascular event follow outcome : All-cause mortality , acute myocardial infarction , cardiac arrest , low cardiac output/cardiogenic shock , stroke , coronary re-intervention . However , opinion , definition high-risk patient interpret carefully . Although EuroSCORE identifies patient base 18 independent variable , many consider study . Risk factor previous cardiac surgery , critical preoperative state , emergency operation , poor leave ventricular dysfunction exclude . In real world , 1500 patient , Heart Institute researcher University São Paulo , show low mortality among patient operate OPCAB . So , certain cutoff EuroSCORE &gt; 4.5 2000 Bernstein-Parsonnet score &gt; 17.75 , OPCAB significantly reduce chance operative mortality . Indeed , numerous large retrospective study meta-analyses show significant short-term improvement OPCAB comparable long-term outcome . A recent risk-adjusted analysis national Society Thoracic Surgeons database assess 876081 patient demonstrate significant reduction death stroke ( 11 % 34 % reduction , respectively ) OPCAB . After , important reconsider best approach patient higher surgical risk CABG . Clearly base build strong scientific evidence group experiment benefit OPCAB . This could change focus relation use cardiopulmonary bypass coronary artery bypass surgery , well preference complete revascularization use arterial graft , especially extremely high risk patient . Really , randomize , control trial fail demonstrate significant mortality benefit OPCAB . However , available randomize , control trial underpowered detect significant difference rarely event stroke death suffer high selection exclusion bias . Even important fact available randomize , control trial far primarily focus low-risk ( ROOBY , CORONARY ) , elevated-risk ( GOPCABE ) high-risk patient ( BBS ) frailty patient benefit OPCAB well define . Investigators believe avoid cardiopulmonary bypass view primarily step toward avoid aortic manipulation . Despite long-term benefit surgery , patient may choose percutaneous coronary intervention treatment complex multivessel disease avoid morbidity associate CABG , stroke fear . Expert OPCAB surgeon offer equivalent durability graft patency CABG , low rate stroke aortic manipulation avoid . Cardiac Risk Scores , include EuroSCORE STS , develop predict risk adverse outcome follow surgery . Frailty , independent predictor mortality complication , include risk algorithm . Emerging evidence suggest frailty well marker biological age important chronological age . Afilalo et al . determined patient slow preoperative gait speed ( ≥6 walk 5 ) 2 3 fold increase risk mortality major morbidity give level STS-Predicted Risk Mortality Major Morbidity ( PROM ) compare normal speed . Lee et al . perform retrospective review large cardiac registry , compare outcome non-frail frail individual . Frailty independent risk factor in-hospital mortality ( risk-adjusted odds ratio [ OR ] 1.8 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.1-3.0 ; P = 0.03 ) mortality 2 year ( risk-adjusted hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.5 , 95 % CI 1.1-2.2 ; P = 0.01 ) . The benefit coronary artery bypass graft without cardiopulmonary bypass Pre-frailty Frailty patient still undetermined . Investigators believe OPCAB remain important technique improvement coronary surgery . The question right : Pre-frailty Frailty patient benefit OPCAB CABG ? The aim paper clarify potential benefit OPCAB Pre-frailty Frailty patient , Investigators conduct national , multicenter , control , randomize clinical trial compare OPCAB versus CABG FRAGIL trial .</detailed_description>
