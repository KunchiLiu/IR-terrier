	<detailed_description>Aortic valve replacement mechanical biological heart valves treatment choice aortic valve stenosis . Over past several year , life expectancy increase industrial nation , accompany rise rate elderly patient multiple illness . Aortic stenosis remain common cause adult valvular heart disease , prevalence increase age . Average survival patient treat conservatively historically report 2â€”5 year onset symptom . More recent study confirm dismal prognosis severe aortic stenosis . Advanced age , reduce left-ventricular ejection fraction , congestive heart fail-ure renal insufficiency appear independent predictor reduce survival . Asymptomatic patient severe aortic stenosis also share poor prognosis high event rate risk rapid functional deterioration . Early surgery offer therapeutic option improve clinical outcome via decrease cardiac mortality improve symptom . Bioprostheses offer several advantage mechanical bioprostheses , important freedom anticoagulation low rate thromboembolic accident . In response clinical need support advance minimally invasive surgical approach conventional AVR , Edwards Lifesciences develop EDWARDS INTUITY Valve System achieve clinical benefit reduce cardiopulmonary bypass cross clamp time , facilitate less invasive approach aor-tic valve replacement . The system include EDWARDS INTUITY Valve System , Model 8300A EDWARDS INTUITY Delivery System , Model 8300D ; valve base prior heart valve design long history safety effectiveness incorporate additional feature design improve patient outcomes safety . With 3 guide suture secure balloon expandable frame , EDWARDS INTUITY Valve system well suit small in-cisions tight access , emphasis procedural efficiency within exist operate suite surgeon .</detailed_description>
