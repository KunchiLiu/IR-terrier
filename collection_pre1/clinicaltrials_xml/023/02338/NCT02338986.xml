	<brief_summary>Background : - There emerge infectious disease recently . Some could affect many people . Some like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) cause new germ . Sometimes know germ suddenly infect new large area , like Ebola . Many disease good treatment available . Researchers may able develop treatment use antibody infection . Objective : - To collect antibody people high level antibody disease study . Eligibility : - Healthy men 18-70 year old weigh least 110 pound . They may infect vaccinate one new infection researcher study . Design : - Participants screen medical history blood test . Researchers determine participant apheresis . - Participants apheresis . First , interview . Then , needle place vein . Blood drawn , machine separate blood cell antibodies protein . The blood cell return participant another vein . It take 60 minute actual collection . - Participants ask procedure least 3 time . They participate 20 session total part study . There must least 7 day session .</brief_summary>
