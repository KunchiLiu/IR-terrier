	<brief_summary>Retaining HIV-infected patient care critical , loss follow-up enrolment often reach 20 % -40 % two year , place million patient risk poor outcome . A strategy optimize retention within resource constraint urgently need . Sequential adaptive strategy - novel class public health approach - may offer solution . A candidate sequential adaptive strategy would start less expensive intervention ( e.g. , SMS ) patient apply costly intensive one ( e.g. , navigator ) patient show early sign poor retention . This study involve sequential multiple assignment randomize trial evaluate family strategy . investigator randomize 2,500 adult newly initiate antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) 4 HIV clinic Nyanza region Kenya ( 1 ) standard care routine education counselling ( REC ) , ( 2 ) SMS text message , ( 3 ) transport voucher . Patients early sign weaken retention ( define first time patient 14 day late appointment ) re-randomized ( 1 ) single episode outreach ( standard care ) , ( 2 ) SMS combine voucher , ( 3 ) peer navigator . Patients successfully contact 28 day miss visit ( verified leave area transfer another clinic ) also rerandomized one three re-engagement intervention . Individuals randomize first stage SMS voucher miss visit least 14 day first 12 month follow re-randomized 12 month stop first stage intervention continue intervention 24 month . The investigator primary objective ass comparative effectiveness sequence intervention strategy prevent initial lapse retention treat occur . The investigator primary endpoint alive virologically suppress two year enrolment . In addition , investigator assess comparative effectiveness first-stage strategy ( REC , SMS , voucher ) prevent lapse retention , comparative effectiveness second stage strategy ( outreach , SMS + voucher , navigator ) re-engage patient initial lapse . This study also compare outcome among patient continue versus discontinue SMS voucher intervention , include small complementarity component utilize qualitative method examine voucher approach effect discontinue approach success among subset participant . At study conclusion investigator output menu adaptive strategy retention , accompany estimate cost effectiveness , policy maker different setting use advance impact HIV care treatment program Africa .</brief_summary>
