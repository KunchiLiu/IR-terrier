	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether commonly prescribe orally inhaled corticosteroid treatment induce clinically meaningful elevation intraocular pressure , administer patient ocular hypertension ( OHT ) open-angle glaucoma ( OAG ) . Based response high-dose corticosteroid , patient group likely normal population demonstrate adverse effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Systemic topical ophthalmic steroid long associate ocular effect , glaucoma cataract . [ 1-8 ] Periocular steroid injection [ 9,10 ] steroid apply periocular skin [ 11 ] also report increase intraocular pressure ( IOP ) raise IOP major risk factor glaucoma . Ocular hypertension ( OHT ) define IOP 21mmHg one eye without detectable glaucomatous damage . Primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) chronic progressive optic neuropathy unknown etiology characterize disc cupping , often associate visual field defect elevate IOP . This disease one leading cause blindness worldwide . [ 12 ] Approximately 18 % 36 % general population corticosteroid responder . This response increase 46 % 92 % patient POAG . [ 13 ] Asthma common chronic respiratory illness Canada , affect approximately 10 % population . For majority patient , long-term inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) standard care prevent acute asthma exacerbation . [ 14 ] Although systemic absorption inhale nasal steroid establish , clinically relevant ocular side effect poorly define . [ 15,16 ] A large prospective study 1995 Samiy et al report statistically significant increase IOP 187 patient without glaucoma take inhaled steroid various pulmonary condition . [ 17 ] However , six case increase IOP associate combined nasal inhale steroid use non-glaucomatous patient report . [ 18-20 ] A large case-control study 1997 suggest current user high dos ICS prescribe regularly 3 month increase risk OHT OAG ( OR 1.44 ; 95 % CI 1.01-2.06 ) . [ 21 ] In contrast , Gozalez et al . conduct nested case-control study 2010 Quebec data show current continuous use ICS result increase risk glaucoma raise IOP require treatment . [ 22 ] Similarly , Duh et al . report association inhale budesonide daily therapy increase IOP 1255 asthmatic patient . [ 23 ] Further , prospective population-based cohort study publish 2012 suggested association development OAG ICS elderly . [ 24 ] In 2013 , group publish randomize double-masked control trial show evidence IOP elevation 6 week use beclomethasone nasal spray 19 patient OHT POAG . [ 25 ] The purpose current study protocol would extend study investigate ICS patient population . To date , effect inhale corticosteroid pre-existing OHT POAG remain uncertain . Considering large number patient inhaled steroid , investigate use inhale steroid glaucoma patient could significant clinical impact . This study design evaluate effect inhale fluticasone propionate intraocular pressure ( IOP ) patient OHT control open-angle glaucoma ( OAG ) . Patient randomization perform independent Research Coordinator separate physical space keep seal principal study investigator , assess record outcome measure , completion study data collection . IOP measure masked fashion , use second observer record value . Two measurement within 1 mmHg average data point . With sample size 8 patient per interventional arm , study power 0.80 detect elevation 3.2 mmHg ( â‰¥20 % ) mean , assume standard deviation 2.5 mmHg . Baseline data compare group use student 's test Fisher exact test . A 2-sided p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . The primary outcome measure ( mean IOP ) assess use 1-sided Student test .</detailed_description>
