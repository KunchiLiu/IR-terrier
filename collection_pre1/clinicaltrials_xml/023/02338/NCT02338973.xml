	<brief_summary>Background : - People rod-cone dystrophy ( RCD ) enhance S-cone syndrome ( ESCS ) excess fluid retina eye . This cause vision loss . The medicine interferon gamma-1b may help people disease . Objectives : - To see interferon gamma-1b eyedrop safe people RCD ESCS . To see medicine decrease retina fluid help prevent vision loss . Eligibility : - People least 12 year old RCD ESCS . Those ESCS must two mutation NR2E3 gene . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , eye exam , blood test . - Participants stay NIH 2 day get first eyedrop . - Participants give 4 study eyedrops 4 time daily 2 week keep diary . - Participants 2 phone call 5 outpatient visit 8 week . They may : - Repeats screen test . - Questionnaires . - Small piece skin remove . - Eye exam , include eye dilation task computer screen . - Fluorescein angiography . A dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . A camera take picture . - Electroretinography . Participants sit dark wearing eyepatch . A small electrode tap forehead . After 30 minute , researcher remove eyepatch put numb eyedrop contact lens . Participants watch flash light . - Electrooculography . Electrodes attach outside eye eye function measure dark light . - Participants follow-up visit 52 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interferon Gamma-1b Administered Topically Macular Edema/Intraretinal Schisis Cysts Rod-Cone Dystrophy ( RCD ) Enhanced S-Cone Syndrome ( ESCS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Rod-cone dystrophy ( RCD ) term apply number genetically heterogenous disease present night vision abnormality , visual field defect reduce rod electroretinography response . Enhanced S-Cone syndrome ( ESCS ) rare autosomal recessive retinal disease developmental degenerative aspect . Macular cystic change , often florid usually result reduction central acuity , frequently associate disease . The reason association well understood . Acetazolamide ( Diamox ) Dorzolamide ( Trusopt ) report variable success reduce cystic change effect frequently inadequate . The objective study evaluate safety potential efficacy Interferon ( IFN ) gamma-1b administer topically macular edema/retinal schisis cyst RCD ESCS . Possible disease-related pathophysiologic mechanism explore use induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) protocols lead iPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) photoreceptor generation . Study Population : Up five participant RCD significant macular cystic change five participant ESCS significant macular cystic change enrol receive IFN gamma-1b administer topically one eye . However , additional two participant may enrol order obtain five participant disease group include primary analysis participant withdraw study prior receive five day treatment . Design : This single-center , prospective , uncontrolled , unmasked pilot Phase I/II study safety , tolerability possible efficacy IFN gamma-1b participant RCD ESCS macular cystic change . One eye five participant RCD significant macular cystic change five participant ESCS significant macular cystic change [ evidenced optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) &gt; 275 micron central macular thickness and/or disruption foveal contour ] receive topical IFN gamma-1b instill drop cornea . The initial stage study include two participant disease category . Once four participant complete 8-week visit , enrollment halt . Safety Adverse Event Review Committee member unaffiliated study review data preliminary assessment safety efficacy determine whether enrollment continue . If committee determines enrollment continue , three additional participant RCD three participant ESCS enrol . The study complete final participant receive one year follow-up . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure relate safety tolerability IFN gamma-1b administer topically prescribe dosage macular cystic change participant RCD ESCS assess number severity adverse event related IP number withdrawal 52 week ( one year ) post-administration . Additional safety IFN gamma-1b administer topically participant RCD ESCS determine assessment retinal function , ocular structure occurrence adverse event time point . Secondary outcome include change visual function include visual acuity microperimetry , retinal imaging OCT fluorescein angiography .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible , follow inclusion criterion must meet , applicable . 1 . Participant must 12 year age old . 2 . Participant ( legal guardian legal representative ) must understand sign protocol inform consent . 3 . Participant willing comply study procedure expect able return study visit . 4 . Participant must carry clinical diagnosis RCD ESCS . 5 . ESCS participant must molecular confirmation two allele NR2E3 gene mutation 6 . Female participant childbearing potential must pregnant breastfeeding , must negative pregnancy test screening must willing undergo pregnancy test schedule study visit . 7 . Female participant childbearing potential , male participant able father child must ( partner ) hysterectomy vasectomy , completely abstinent intercourse must agree practice two reliable method contraception take IP six week completion . Acceptable method contraception include : Hormonal contraception ( i.e. , birth control pill , inject hormone , dermal patch vaginal ring ) ; Intrauterine device ; Barrier method ( diaphragm , condom ) spermicide ; Surgical sterilization ( tubal ligation ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A participant eligible follow exclusion criterion present . 1 . Participant history ocular disease likely contribute significantly visual disruption ( e.g. , optic neuropathy , glaucoma , uveitis , retinal disease ) . 2 . Participant diagnosis treatment malignancy ( exclude nonmelanoma skin cancer ) within previous five year . 3 . Participant receive investigational treatment another clinical study relate ocular condition last six month . 4 . Participant pregnant , lactating , plan become pregnant ( father child ) study followup period . 5 . Participant allergic fluorescein dye . 6 . Participant systemic condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , IFN gamma may cause MS exacerbation ) . Study Eye Eligibility Criteria A participant must least one eye meeting inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion list . Study Eye Inclusion Criteria 1 . The study eye must retain adequate fixation allow completion protocol assessment . 2 . The study eye must macular cystic change ( &gt; 275 micron and/or disruption foveal contour OCT ) . Study Eye Exclusion Criteria 1 . The study eye lens , cornea , medium opacity preclude adequate visualization test retina . 2 . The study eye undergone intraocular surgery within 6 month prior enrollment . 3 . The study eye disease may confound outcome study [ e.g. , choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) fovea parafoveal area ] . 4 . Participant unwilling discontinue wear contact lens study eye IP administration . Study Eye Selection Criteria Cases Bilateral Disease RCD ESCS usually affect eye similar degree . In case eye participant meet study eye eligibility criterion , follow criterion use select study eye : The eye intraretinal fluid select study eye ; If eye similar level intraretinal fluid , eye bad visual acuity select study eye ; If eye similar level intraretinal fluid visual acuity , right eye select study eye .</criteria>
