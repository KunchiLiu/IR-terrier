	<brief_summary>This open-label , randomize , parallel group Phase 2A/2B study evaluate clinical activity ASLAN001 combination capecitabine compare lapatinib combination capecitabine patient HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer fail prior trastuzumab therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study ASLAN001 Combination With Capecitabine MBC That Has Failed Prior Trastuzumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 2A Design : The Phase 2A part open-label , randomize , parallel group study use tumor size primary efficacy endpoint . Approximately 44 eligible patient randomize 1:1 ratio receive either ASLAN001 400 mg orally twice daily ( BID ) lapatinib 1250 mg orally daily ( QD ) , background capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 orally BID Days 1-14 21-day cycle . Radiological image assess disease status perform baseline every 6 week disease progression ( assessed Investigator ) . Patients experienced disease progression 12 week may continue receive randomize therapy continue radiological scan every 6 week disease progression . Criteria Proceed Phase 2B : In absence safety tolerability concern , continuation Phase 2B part study primarily base statistical comparison percentage change tumor size baseline Week 12 one-sided p-value &lt; 0.1 favor ASLAN001-containing treatment arm would supportive continuation Phase 2B . Phase 2B Design : The Phase 2B part study continue recruit pre-specified efficacy criterion meet Phase 2A part tolerability ASLAN001 combination capecitabine consider acceptable . The Phase 2B part open-label , randomize , parallel group study . In part , approximately 160 patient randomize 1:1 ratio receive either ASLAN001 400 mg BID lapatinib 1250 mg QD , combination capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 BID Days 1-14 21-day cycle .</detailed_description>
