	<brief_summary>Proximal Middle Cerebral Artery ( MCA ) occlusion constitute severe stroke . Intra-venous thrombolysis rt-PA within first 4,5 hour proven effective treatment . Prognosis closely related recanalization rate reach 30 50 % . A new therapeutic strategy consist sequential intravenous ( IV ) thrombolysis rt-PA follow 50UI/kg IV tenecteplase ( TNK ) propose case recanalization rt-PA. A case series 13 consecutive patient treat association publish 2011 . A high rate recanalization without hemorrhagic transformation increase report . However , efficiency safety therapeutic assess randomize multi-centric study . Such study great interest since interventional neuroradiology already show superiority regard IV rt-PA . Moreover interventional neuroradiologists specialist available major hospital IV sequential strategy could provide interesting alternative . Main study objective : Main Clinical Objective : Sequential thrombolysis associate significant well outcome 3-month , assess modify Rankin score ( mRS ) . Main Radiological Objective : Sequential thrombolysis associate high rate recanalization ( TIMI 2b/3 ) 24-hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , multi-center , national , randomize , biomedical study compare two therapeutic strategy ischemic stroke associate proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion .
