	<brief_summary>This phase I trial combination PARP inhibitor olaparib AKT inhibitor AZD5363 . There two part study . Part A : dose escalation , Part B : dose expansion . Part A investigate combination 300 mg bd olaparib intrapatient ascend dos AZD5363 administer either 4-days-on , 3-days-off , 2-days-on , 5-days-off . Once Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) reach arm ( advice Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) one schedule discontinue ) , schedule optimum safety PK/PD profile take forward dose expansion phase ( Part B ) . Part B evaluate optimize dose/schedule identify Part A study patient ( 1 ) BRCA1/2 mutant cancer ( previous disease progression PARP inhibitor monotherapy ) , ( 2 ) advance sporadic tumour ( e.g . TNBC , CRPC , HGSOC tumours somatic mutation aberration know result hyperactivated PI3K-AKT pathway ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Olaparib Combination With AZD5363 ( ComPAKT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part A : The starting dose intermittent schedule 300 mg bd olaparib either AZD5363 give 320 mg bd 4-days-on , 3-days-off , 480 mg bd 2-days-on , 5-days-off . These start dos base available data first-in-human study [ D0810C00002 ] ( AstraZeneca ) [ D3610C00001 ] ( AstraZeneca ) drug , respectively . A general schema 3 potential dose level pursue 4-days-on , 3-days-off AZD5363 schedule ( Schedule A ) 2-days-on , 5-days-off AZD5363 schedule ( Schedule B ) Part A study list . The start dose olaparib fix 300mg bd schedule . These schema provide general guidance ; possible dose one drug escalate de-escalated `` seesaw '' fashion contingent toxicity and/or PK/PD data report . This may create dose cohort combination list . Both PK PD data take consideration available . With exception dose level 1 , actual dose escalation/de-escalation determine follow discussion SRC dose escalation teleconference . Dose escalation continue MTD ( ) reach . Patients dose flat scale body weight body surface area . Both schedule carry parallel . Table 1 : Schema dose escalation schedule A ( 4-days-on , 3-days-off AZD5363 ) Dose level ( DL ) olaparib bd AZD5363 bd 4d-on , 3d-off - 1 200mg* 240mg 1 . 300mg 320mg 2 . 300mg 400mg 3 . 300mg 480mg *An intermediate dose 250mg bd olaparib may consider depend drug-related toxicity observe patient tolerability Table 2 : Schema dose escalation schedule B ( 2-days-on , 5-days-off AZD5363 ) Dose level ( DL ) olaparib bd AZD5363 bd 2d-on , 5d-off - 1 200mg* 400mg 1 . 300mg 480mg 2 . 300mg 560mg 3 . 300mg 640mg - An intermediate dose 250mg bd olaparib may consider depend drug-related toxicity observe patient tolerability After careful review clinical toxicity data , DLT deem caused one agent , responsible drug may dose decrease well tolerate , agent maybe increase subsequent cohort . If necessary , drug also dose de-escalated . In Part A study , olaparib administer continuously intermittent AZD5363 21-day cycle . Intrapatient dose escalation AZD5363 utilised evaluate different dose level . The optimal dose schedule select base toxicity , PK-PD and/or efficacy data take forward two expansion cohort Part B study . Cohort 1 comprise patient germline BRCA1/2 mutate tumour , Cohort 2 comprise advance sporadic cancer may harbour HR defect ( e.g . TNBC , CRPC HGSOC ) somatic mutation aberration know result hyperactivated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K ) -AKT pathway .</detailed_description>
