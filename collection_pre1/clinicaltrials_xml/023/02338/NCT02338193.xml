	<brief_summary>Women history gestational diabetes ( GDM ) substantially increase risk type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . Compared general population , woman likely overweight obese . Moreover , weight gain GDM significantly associate T2DM , independent baseline body weight . Weight gain , particularly increased central adiposity delivery , strongly associate deterioration β-cell compensation insulin resistance . Taken together , finding study support increase abdominal fat strong factor associate decline B-cell compensation insulin resistance prior GDM woman high risk T2DM . Dapagliflozin novel highly selective SGLT2 inhibitor improve glycemic control reduce renal glucose reabsorption lead urinary glucose excretion . Its efficacy safety study multiple randomize controlled trial include add-on metformin compare placebo . To extent glucotoxicity contributes demise β-cell function subject impair glucose , SGLT2 inhibitor also may prove useful treatment `` prediabetes . '' An additional secondary benefit SGLT2 inhibition elimination calorie form glucose . The loss glucose attendant caloric loss contributes weight loss ; addition , improvement β cell function see . Weight loss see SGLT2 inhibitor similar see glucagon-like peptide 1 analog , may acceptable oral agent . A consistent finding dapagliflozin study reduction blood pressure . The investigator hypothesize combination dapagliflozin -metformin treatment 24-week period great positive impact body weight , anthropometric measurement glycemic cardiometabolic parameter dapagliflozin metformin monotherapy overweight/obese at-risk woman history GDM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following write consent , study patient undergo follow clinical , metabolic laboratory evaluation treatment . To ensure patient remain unidentified , study subject assign individual study identifier include study acronym , patient initial , unique number . All blood sample obtain result identify report use unique study identifier . A full physical examination perform vital sign ( blood pressure , respiration temperature ) determine . Trained personnel use standardized protocol baseline follow-up examination obtain anthropometric measurement blood specimen . Absolute body weight , height , waist hip circumference , body fat distribution ( waist/hip { WHR } ) waist/height ratio ( { WHtR } ) blood pressure ( BP ) determine . Body weight measure near 0.1 kg use calibrated digital scale participant light clothing shoe . Height measure near centimeter . The total body adiposity ( total fatness ) , define accumulation body fat without regard regional distribution , express BMI calculate weight ( kg ) / height ( ) 2 . The circumference measurement take upright position use 15-mm width flexible metric tape hold close body tight enough indent skin . Waist circumference ( WC ) measure narrow level midway low rib iliac crest hip circumference measure wide level buttock subject stand breathe normally . The WHR WHtR calculate measure body fat distribution . All patient randomly assign one 3 medication treatment group -- dapagliflozin-metformin ( DAP-MET ; 5 mg DAP/ MET 1000 mg BID ) , metformin XR ( MET 1000 mg BID ) dapagliflozin ( DAP 10 mg QD ) ; subject allocate one 3 group base computer-generated random number use block randomization method . Oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTTs ) glucose ( G ) insulin ( I ) measure 0 , 30 , 60 , 120 glucose load ass diabetes , fast ( FBG ) mean blood glucose ( MBG ) concentration , insulin resistance pancreatic ß-cell function perform prior randomization 20-24 week full dos study medication reach . Mean blood glucose ( MBG ) concentration calculate sum glucose value obtain 0,30,60 120 minute OGTT divide 4 . At initial lab evaluation , creatinine calculate eGFR , TSH , ß-hCG determine study inclusion . Baseline blood sample also analyze lipid profile liver enzymes . All patient receive counsel concern benefit lifestyle modification diet exercise . The patient also encourage increase daily exercise ( walking , use stair ) , although formally assess . The participant receive encouragement adhere regime follow-up phone call . Side effect treatment reason withdrawal study record .</detailed_description>
