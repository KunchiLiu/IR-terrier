	<brief_summary>It clinical importance arrest development approximal caries early stage . The potential initial caries develop manifest lesion motivate study use sealant arrest progression caries occlusal approximal tooth surface . Therefore , aim present study follow-up examine 3.5 year , efficacy seal caries-free non-cavitated mesial surface first permanent molar abut lesion distal surface second primary molar . The null hypothesis test preventive therapeutic sealant prevent development slow progression dental caries period 3.5 year comparison non-sealed control surface .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study population comprise 121 schoolchildren age 8 10 year high-caries community Valparaiso , Chile . They examine clinically radiographically , divide 3 group , treat accordingly : child Group A carious lesion approximal surface 05d-6m received sealant ; group B active caries 05d receive preventive sealant caries-free 6m ; group C active caries 05d initial active lesion 6m receive therapeutic sealant 6m . After 3.5 year , standardize follow-up radiograph obtain child remain .</detailed_description>
