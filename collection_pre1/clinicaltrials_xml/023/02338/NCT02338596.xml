	<detailed_description>Conventional cementless femoral stem know provide high rate satisfactory clinical outcome long-term follow-up . However , may potential clinical consequence related stress shielding , thigh pain , periprosthetic fracture , proximal/distal dimensional mismatch , easy access pathway wear debries removal revision . In effort reduce risk stress shielding , thigh pain , periprosthetic fracture , proximal/distal stem mismatch , facilitate removal well fixed stem , new ultra-short anatomic metaphyseal-fitting cementless femoral stem develop . It design provide closely mimic original functioning hip . The absence diaphyseal anchorage attempt proximal load transfer reduce stress shielding , thigh pain proximal distal/mismatch . Furthermore , attempt preservation femoral canal femoral elasticity ease revision . The question thus arise whether possible obtain strong long-lasting fixation femoral component without diaphyseal anchor . As clinical radiographic performance ultra-short stem investigated study short-term follow-up , remain elucidated whether ultra-short stem show low incidence implant loosening , stem misalignment , intraoperative fracture revision rate . The purpose randomize control study compare : ( 1 ) clinical result , include Harris hip score , thigh pain , Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis ( WOMAC ) Index score , patient ' satisfaction ; ( 2 ) radiographic result , include stress shielding , implant loosening , stem misalignment ; ( 3 ) intraoperative fracture revision rate cementless total hip arthroplasty use ultra-short anatomic metaphyseal-fitting cementless femoral stem versus conventional metaphyseal diaphyseal fit anatomi proximal porous-coated cementless stem patient underwent bilateral simultaneous sequential total hip arthroplasty one anesthetic .</detailed_description>
