	<brief_title>A Physiological Study Determine Enteral Threonine Requirements Infants Aged 1 6 Months</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Threonine indispensable AA must come dietary source . It critical production mucin gut ( Law , Bertolo et al . 2007 ) contribute significantly collagen , elastin tooth enamel formation ( Kramsch , Franzblau et al . 1971 , Robinson , Lowe et al . 1975 ) . The current adequate intake ( AI ) threonine infant propose Institute Medicine , Food Nutrition Board , 2005 Dietary Reference Intakes ( DRIs ) macronutrients base factorial approach due lack conclusive empirical data . Studies lead determination amino acid ( AA ) requirement infant use nitrogen analysis technique perform 20 year ago ( Snyderman , Norton et al . 1959 ) . Methodological advance make possible determine AA requirement human precise technique ( Zello , Wykes et al . 1995 ) . However , study threonine requirement infant ( 1- 6mo age ) use new stable-isotope method report . To accurately determine amino acid requirement , necessary provide range amino acid intake . For ethical reason , infant feed low high test amino acid diet prolong period time . The minimally invasive IAAO method , initially develop adult laboratory ( Zello , Pencharz et al . 1993 ) use internationally ( Huang , Hogewind-Schoonenboom et al . 2011 ) determine amino acid requirement , overcomes problem . The IAAO method take less 24 hour conduct use safely parenterally feed neonate , enterally feed neonate , child adult . Our laboratory determine enteral requirement threonine piglet ( Bertolo , Chen et al . 1998 ) 0.42g/kg/d . We able extrapolate data , propose enteral requirement neonate would 84 mg/kg/d . In study determine enteral requirement 1 - 6 month old infant predict since growth slow protein requirement decrease first month life , enteral requirement infant similar DRI 's AI 73 mg/kg/d . Thus , objective study determine enteral Threonine requirement infant 1 6 month age IAAO method . SUBJECTS AND METHODS Subjects : A total 18 study perform participant randomize 1 18 test threonine intake . Infants age 1 6 month recruit in-patient post-surgical population Hospital Sick Children ( SickKids ) , Toronto , Canada . Participants may eligible participate one study intake follow enrolment , therefore randomized second threonine intake . All study procedure consent form approval research ethic board SickKids . Permission enroll infant study obtain attend surgeon write informed consent obtain one parents/guardians . Recruitment patient expect begin December 2015 . The study register clinicaltrials.gov # NCT02364843 . Infants include study age 1 6 month , bear 32 week 43 week gestational age , clinically stable determine normal blood value vital sign , in-patients feed via nasogastric ( NG- ) , jejunal ( NJ- J- ) , gastric ( G- ) feed tube . Infants exclude receive supplemental oxygen , mechanically ventilate , endocrine genetic anomaly would influence protein AA metabolism , receive medication would influence protein AA metabolism ( eg . Corticosteroid therapy ) . Experimental design study diet The study design minimally invasive IAAO design , base concept , AA 's store body , intake dietary essential AAs relative use protein synthesis determine whether oxidize incorporated protein . When intake one indispensable AA restrict , indispensable AAs excess oxidize incorporated protein previously describe ( Zello , Pencharz et al . 1993 ) . Each study take place 18 - 24 hour period follow confirmation infant 's clinical dietitian appropriate enteral intake protein non-protein energy infant 's feed deliver 24 48 hour precede study day . On one study day ( duration le 24 hour ; see Fig . 1 ) , infant receive formula make commercial protein free enteral formula ( Pro-Phree ) supply know amount carbohydrate , fat , mineral , trace element vitamins appropriate infant AA mixture add . Amino acids add pattern breast milk follow mg·kg-1·d-1 : Lys 207 , Met 48 , Leu 288 , Ile 165 , Val 165 , Phe 126 , Try 51 , His 63 , Tyr 156 , Arg 69 , Pro 240 , Cys 51 , Gly 69 , Ala 114 , Ser 150 , Asp 270 , Glu 534 ( WHO 2007 ) . Each infant receive different intake Threonine per study 18 intake 18 infant fall continuum 15 130 mg·kg-1·d-1 . As intake threonine vary , formula maintain isonitrogenous vary intake alanine dispensable AA . The amino acid mixture put 0.22 µ filter ensure sterile pathogen free . This add safety step do commercial formula do parenteral solution study Threonine Lysine requirement parenterally fed infant ( Chapman 2009 , 2010 ) . Combining AA mixture commercially prepared Pro-Phree formulation do hospital 's Formula Room standard operate procedure ( SOP ) guideline clinical formula preparation . The infant receive study formula via feed tube , combination tube feed oral feed , 18 - 24 hour study period order clinical dietician . A research-grade stable isotope tracer , manufacture Cambridge Isotope Laboratories ( CIL ) , Maine , USA , use measure oxidation protein deposition response vary intake threonine . The stable isotope amino acid L- [ 1-13C ] Phenylalanine , administer infant 's feed dose 15 µ·kg-1/h-1 . This stable isotope find human 1 % total percentage amino acid phenylalanine stable isotope use successfully without harm give intravenously infant 4 previous study conduct The Hospital Sick Children , Toronto Canada ( Roberts 2001 ; Courtney Martin 2008 ; Chapman 2009 , 2010 ) . We use study protocol provide sufficient time infant reach steady state stable 1-13CPhenylalanine isotope baseline value determine infant parenteral study ( Chapman 2009 , 2010 ) . We conduct first two study use phenylalanine stable isotope . If analysis , find see sufficient difference baseline steady state level 1-13CPhenylalanine stable isotope , introduce one-time dose 13C-sodium bicarbonate ( NaH13CO2 ) 14 μmol kg-1 administer NG/G tube permit u see differentiation infant 's naturally occur 1-13CPhenylalanine amount administer formula . We believe need use bicarbonate isotope add protocol approval use become necessary . It use routinely group scientist Netherlands also study infant amino acid requirement report issue administration ( Hogewind-Schoonenboom 2014 ) The stable isotope tracer label `` For Research Use Only '' acceptable use human age confirm Isotope manufacturing company provide Certificate Analysis test chemical purity , presence , , heavy metal ( part per million ) microbiological test include pyrogen . Both isotope prepare Diet Kitchen hospital time preparation study formula SOP guideline clinical diet . Sample collection analysis Breath sample urine collect determine change infant ' response study diet . Three baseline breath urine sample collect prior introduction study diet . Four plateau breath urine sample collect every hour begin 12-18 hour introduction Research grade stable isotope-labeled tracer . Breath sample collect use Carbon Dioxide Analyzer Cart similar design use clinical test device call Calorimeter . Both device use vent hood system infant sleep rest VCO2 measure . Each breath sample collect 10 minute period bubble breath effluent reflux condenser trap breath test tube . The breath sample measure continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer . Urine sample collect place cotton ball infant 's diaper analyze tandem mass spectrometer . Statistical analysis The effect threonine intake phenylalanine flux , oxidation , F13CO2 test use analysis variance PROC GLM procedure ( SAS version 9.4 ) . Estimates mean threonine intake derive breakpoint analysis rate release 13CO2 ( F13CO2 ) data use 2-phase linear regression crossover model . The breakpoint calculate use mixed model regression procedure SAS slope line significantly different zero . Statistical significance establish P &lt; 0.05 . Regression analysis variable threonine independent variable F13CO2 phenylalanine oxidation dependent variable . Selection best model determine factor relate fit ( significance model r2 ) estimate variation model ( CV SE estimate ) . The population Recommended Dietary Allowance estimate determine upper 95 % confidence limit breakpoint estimate .</detailed_description>
