	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) largely lifestyle-related condition # 1 killer adult United States . Our work aim understanding short-term increase blood sugar , like accompany eat meal , affect blood vessel function risk CVD . This research aim understanding meal compose egg affect short-term increase blood sugar eating , connect increase risk CVD . In particular , investigator try identify specific meal compose either whole egg , egg yolk , egg white , best reduces acute increase blood sugar bring meal consist majority carbohydrate . At time , investigator try explore protective affect egg may blood vessel function reduction CVD risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death United States [ 1 ] . The inability blood vessel properly enlarge shrink , know vascular endothelial dysfunction ( VED ) , early event lead CVD cause postprandial hyperglycemia ( PPH ) [ 1 ] short-term increase blood sugar occur eaten . Although know occurs , research show temporary increase blood sugar impair blood vessel 's ability properly enlarge shrink . We also know impaired vessel function early event lead CVD research show short-term increase blood sugar impair blood vessel function , even healthy people [ 2 ] . Because high blood level cholesterol increase CVD risk , trigger flaw guideline restrict cholesterol diet [ 3 ] , include limit egg consumption . The misguided fear towards eat egg routinely challenge large-scale study fail associate egg heart disease risk [ 4-8 ] . Research show egg improve function insulin reduce blood sugar [ 9 ] . They also contain bioactive peptide may attenuate oxidative stress [ 10-11 ] . This provide rationale study dietary strategy reduce PPH VED . Thus , objective study define potential benefit eggs component ( egg yolk egg white ) blood vessel health adult prediabetes .</detailed_description>
