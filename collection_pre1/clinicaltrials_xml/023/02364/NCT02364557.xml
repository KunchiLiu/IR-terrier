	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial study well standard care therapy stereotactic radiosurgery and/or surgery work compare standard care therapy alone treat patient breast cancer spread one two location body ( limited metastatic ) previously untreated . Standard care therapy comprise chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , biological therapy , others may help stop spread tumor cell . Radiation therapy and/or surgery usually give standard care therapy relieve pain ; however , patient limit metastatic breast cancer , stereotactic radiosurgery , also know stereotactic body radiation therapy , may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue surgery may able effectively remove metastatic tumor cell . It yet know whether standard care therapy effective stereotactic radiosurgery and/or surgery treating limit metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standard Care Therapy With Without Stereotactic Radiosurgery and/or Surgery Treating Patients With Limited Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether ablation ( stereotactic body radiation therapy [ SBRT ] [ stereotactic radiosurgery ] and/or surgical resection know metastasis ) oligometastatic breast cancer patient provide sufficient signal improve progression-free survival ( PFS ) warrant full accrual Phase III portion trial . ( Phase II-R ) II . To determine whether ablation ( SBRT and/or surgical resection know metastasis ) oligometastatic breast cancer patient significantly improve overall survival ( OS ) . ( Phase III ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate treated metastasis control accord tumor receptor status ( estrogen receptor [ ER ] , progesterone receptor [ PR ] , human epidermal growth factor receptor [ HER ] -2 ) , use chemotherapy , surgery vs. ablative therapy , solitary metastasis vs. 2 metastasis ( may expand &gt; = 2 = &lt; 4 follow completion Phase I trial ) . II . To evaluate whether addition ablative metastasis direct therapy significantly reduce number distant recurrence ( new metastasis ) patient progress accord tumor receptor status ( ER , PR , HER-2 ) ; use chemotherapy , solitary metastasis vs. 2 metastasis ( may expand &gt; = 2 = &lt; 4 follow completion Phase I NRG-BR001 trial ) . III . To evaluate adverse event patient receive ablative metastasis-directed therapy know metastasis addition standard medical therapy alone . IV . To explore appropriate clinically relevant technological parameter ensure quality effectiveness throughout radiation therapy process , include imaging , simulation , target critical structure definition , treatment planning , image guidance , delivery . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether &lt; 5 circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) ( per 7.5 ml blood ) independent prognostic ( outcome ) marker improve PFS OS oligometastatic breast cancer . II . To determine whether &lt; 5 CTCs ( per 7.5 ml blood ) independent predictive ( response therapy ) marker improve PFS OS oligometastatic breast cancer . III . To determine whether eliminate CTCs ( 0/7.5 ml blood patient least 2 CTCs registration ) prognostic predictive marker improve PFS OS . IV . To evaluate prognostic predictive property CTC count continuous measure PFS OS . V. To store material retrospective analysis circulate tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( ctDNA ) . VI . To store material retrospective analysis circulate micro-ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM 1 : Patients continue receive current plan systemic therapy discretion treat physician . ARM 2 : Patients continue receive current plan systemic therapy discretion treat physician . Patients also undergo stereotactic radiosurgery 1 , 3 , 5 fraction within 3 week and/or surgery discretion treat physician . ARM 1 : Patients follow every 3 month randomization 2 year . ARM 2 : Patients follow 25-35 day post-ablation , every 3 month randomization 2 year , yearly thereafter .</detailed_description>
