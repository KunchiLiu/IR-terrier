	<brief_summary>Acute Kidney Injury condition kidney suddenly stop work properly usually occur already unwell illness happen surgery . Having episode acute kidney injury increase risk progression chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) later decrease long-term survival . It also major socioeconomic impact regard admission length hospital stay . There currently universally accept treatment method identify patient risk . The investigator aim measure arterial stiffness patient prior undergoing cardiac surgery investigate whether measurement associate increase risk patient develop acute kidney injury surgery . The investigator plan measure arterial stiffness , examine blood sample , kidney health-related level determine whether association patient stiff arterial vessel patient may develop acute kidney injury surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arterial Stiffness AKI Post-CABG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) affect around 20 % hospitalised patient . Previously believe recovery episode AKI result full renal recovery return normal function long term . However assumption may reflect fact many patient receive long term follow-up failure return baseline renal function identify . It recognise AKI major long-term health socioeconomic impact . Studies demonstrate episode AKI significantly increase risk development chronic kidney disease early mortality . Episodes dialysis-requiring AKI patient previously normal renal function dialysis-dependent discharge result 28-fold increase risk develop severe chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) stage 4 5 2-fold increase risk death one year compare non-AKI control . This also observed 5-year follow-up period , patient suffer episode AKI 6-fold increase risk develop CKD stage 4 end stage renal failure ( ESRF ) . There also increase risk death patient experience episode non-dialysis require AKI , remain apparent even mild AKI stage 1 . AKI long-term impact patient morbidity mortality , effect appear persist despite 'biochemical resolution ' . The size impact dependent upon degree severity duration AKI experience . However , controversy regard link AKI CKD . At present time specific therapy AKI management patient completely supportive . Furthermore , absence sensitive biomarkers , would appear even non-severe episode AKI already confer bad prognosis regard risk development CKD long term survival patient . Thus perhaps focus prevention AKI oppose cure . This even pertinent one considers National Confidential Enquiry Patient Outcomes Death ( NCEPOD ) report 2009 identify 30 % case 'preventable ' deficiency care 50 % case . The median length stay patient diagnose AKI 17.8 day , 4.7 day longer without AKI . Marion Kerr , health economist , report avoid 'preventable ' case potential save Â£130-186 million per year could make . The difficulty lie identification patient risk AKI . Although factor diabetes , old age low estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) associate increase risk , standardize score method risk . In addition , fully clear patient suffer AKI others , similar co-morbidities , . Arterial stiffness ( AS ) define 'the unit pressure require generate change volume one unit ' within specify arterial segment . Clinically assess non-invasively measurement pulse wave velocity ( PWV . AS varies significantly age , gender race , last year study undertake attempt quantify 'normal ' reference value within various population . Arterial stiffness also increase numerous clinical condition diabetes hypertension increase evidence AS may important predictor disease progression potential recovery wide spectrum condition include cardiovascular risk , development dementia , functional recovery stroke renal disease . Increased AS show associate decreased kidney function independent risk factor cardiovascular event ESRF renal transplant recipient . The mechanism injury CKD increase AS thought relate barotrauma inflict glomerulus `` stiff '' vascular system . However , little data regard effect AS AKI . For initial pilot study , select cohort patient undergo elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) see type event associate increase risk AKI . On average 450 patient per year undergo CABG surgery King 's College Hospital ( KCH ) 200 elective operation . All elective patient attend pre-assessment clinic , run weekly 20 patient per clinic . Many patient co-morbidities associate increase risk AKI AS . We perform retrospective analysis incidence AKI patient undergo elective , isolated CABG surgery KCH January December 2012 . Of total 219 patient , 42 patient classify post-operative AKI accord serum AKI criterion .</detailed_description>
