	<brief_title>Early Risk Stratification ED Chest Pain Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients chest pain commonly present Emergency Departments ( ED ) , often underlying ischaemic heart disease . Although 40 % non-cardiac origin , clinical assessment place heavy burden hospital resource . Conversely , despite increase awareness diagnostic advance , 2-8 % patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) misdiagnosed conventional method inappropriately discharge home , result double mortality . In Hong Kong , 1.4 million people ( 17 % total population ) 65 year old 2021 . The risk develop ischaemic heart disease increase age . Thus age population may lead large burden health service . Since 2009 , Hospital Authority identify improvement ACS management priority area . Current protocols rule in/out patient suspect ACS involve symptom monitoring , serial electrocardiograms serial troponin test 6 hour . This lengthy assessment safe contribute ED overcrowding , duplication effort associate increased cost adverse patient outcome . Even patient protocol negative , discharge , unclear follow earlier , follow later . An assessment process efficiently safely improve early risk-stratification patient suspect ACS would beneficial . Current advance proteomics pave way sensitive biomarkers . One biomarkers - heart-type fatty acid-binding protein ( H-FABP ) - detect blood within one hour myocardial injury , recently emerge prognostic marker ACS . It predict mortality re-infarction patient troponin-negative ACS . If troponin H-FABP negative , mortality rate 6 month 0 % . Adding H-FABP troponin-based protocol could also avoid unnecessary investigation cause false-positive troponins . Although high-sensitivity cardiac troponin ( hs-cTn ) test may achieve good analytical performance standard troponin test , increase concern excessive false-positive rate , burden risk result ignore , burden admission positive hs-cTn case admit . This pose question whether additional value measure novel marker H-FABP may use conjunction hs-cTn test . With rapid development non-invasive cardiac imaging , combination biomarkers cardiac imaging may provide good solution diagnostic challenge rapid assessment risk-stratification patient suspect ACS . Coronary artery calcium score ( CACS ) non-invasive image method assess degree calcification coronary artery plaque relate degree underlying atherosclerosis . CACS perform conventional CT scanner without iodinate contrast administration , complete within single short breath hold , inexpensive minimal radiation exposure . A CACS 0 associate 5-year cardiac event rate le 1 % , whereas increase CACS indicate increase risk correlate positively score . Thrombolysis Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) risk score system externally validate widely use structure risk assessment method predict adverse outcome patient unstable angina non-ST elevation MI . It also helpful stratify risk adverse outcome patient undifferentiated chest pain . Its use conjunction biomarker test cardiac image prospectively test . This study design investigate whether CACS , H-FABP test TIMI score provide additional value current assessment process , turn reliably identify patient suspect ACS present ED low- high-risk adverse cardiac event . The investigator hypothesize CACS , H-FABP concentration , hs-cTnT concentration TIMI score positively correlate rate major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) 30 day 6 month patient present ED suspect ACS . Aims : The aim present study patient chest pain uncertain cardiac cause non-ischaemic initial electrocardiogram ( ECG ) present ED 1 . To investigate whether correlation CACS , H-FABP concentration , hs-cTnT concentration TIMI score MACE rate 30 day 6 month ; 2 . To evaluate predictive value CACS , H-FABP , hs-cTnT , TIMI score various combination . Study design participant : Patients recruit consecutively weekdays 9:00AM - 5:00PM exclude weekend holiday . For eligible patient , apart routine chest pain protocol include clinical assessment , ECG high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T ( hs-cTnT ) test , three additional step fulfil : 1. H-FABP point-of-care test perform ED arrival repeat 3 hour later ; 2. TIMI score perform ED arrival ; 3. CACS perform within 24 hour ED arrival . All ED physician cardiologists responsible patient management blind CACS result , H-FABP result TIMI score enrol patient aware clinical record , serial ECG hs-cTnT result usual care . All recruit patient treat accord standard practice . Immediate patient management affect CACS result , H-FABP result TIMI score . The decision discharge patient home ED recommend admission chest pain unit , coronary care unit intensive care unit determine ED physician base clinical record , ECG serial hs-cTnT result per standard practice . After hospital discharge , patient contact English- Cantonese-speaking research nurse via telephone follow-up 30 day 6 month initial presentation ask specific scripted question subsequent visit ED , hospital readmission evaluation chest pain , cardiac procedure perform . The research nurse also access patient ' medical record . All-cause mortality , cardiac death , myocardial infarction , all-cause readmission readmission ACS cardiac event , arrhythmia cardiac failure , cardiac test coronary revascularization procedure retrieve verified patient . Data collection measurable parameter : Demographic data , medical history , conventional risk factor include diabetes , hypertension , lipid profile , smoke history , family history , current medication contact information facilitate subsequent follow-up , collect record computerized database . ECG result , serial hs-cTnT result , H-FABP result , CACS result TIMI score also record . In addition , subsequent visit ED , hospital readmission evaluation chest pain cardiac procedure perform retrieved hospital authority 's computerise medical system verify via telephone follow-up 30 day 6 month initial presentation . Furthermore , death , myocardial infarction , readmission ACS , cardiac test coronary revascularization procedure also obtain via dedicate hospital-based computer system . Outcome measure : The primary outcome number patient MACE within 30 day 6 month initial ED presentation . The time first cardiac event final contact encounter patient without event choose assess patient outcome . The prognostic performance CACS , H-FABP test , hs-cTnT test , TIMI score various combination presence absence MACE assess . MACE define relate safety outcome , consist all-cause mortality ( include cardiac death sudden cardiac death ) , cardiac arrest , readmission myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock , effectiveness outcome , consist revascularization ( e.g . coronary artery bypass grafting ) , ventricular arrhythmia need intervention high-degree atrioventricular block need intervention . The secondary outcome include number MACE , safety effectiveness MACE respectively , 30 day 6 month initial ED presentation , prognostic performance ( i.e . sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , positive likelihood ratio negative likelihood ratio ) CACS , H-FABP test , hs-cTnT test , TIMI score various combination . Protocol amendment : Previous study show prognostic value HEART score comparable TIMI score patient present ED chest pain suspect acute coronary syndrome . It would beneficial add HEART score study ass prognostic value hs-cTnT use instead conventional troponin possible role accelerate diagnositic protocol chest pain patient ED use alone combination TIMI score , H-FABP CACS . In October 2014 , modify HEART score patient recruit determine retrospectively base information patient ' record . The modified HEART score consist 5 assessment item maximum score 9 point .</detailed_description>
