	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare efficacy catheter ablation atrial fibrillation contact force-guided impedance-guided annotation use automate annotation system ( Visitag™ ) . Patients receive atrial fibrillation ablation randomly assign number two group impedance guide ablation contact force guide ablation use contact force sense catheter ( THERMOCOOL® SMARTTOUCH™ catheter , Biosense Webster , Inc. , Diamond Bar , CA ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impedance v . Contact Force Guided Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Using Automated Annotation System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During atrial fibrillation ablation , location ablation conduct displayed annotation tag use 3D system recognize energy delivery do area . However annotation method unable identify effectively ablation do . To remedy disadvantage , automate annotation system ( VisiTag™ module , Biosense Webster , Inc. , Diamond Bar , CA ) recently develop make automatic annotation pre-defined criterion satisfy . But study clinical effect system insufficient . The purpose study compare efficacy catheter ablation atrial fibrillation contact force-guided impedance-guided annotation use automate annotation system .</detailed_description>
