	<brief_summary>This study specifically seek provide data safety , tolerability pilot efficacy short course , high dose primaquine treatment Papua New Guinean child age 5-10 year , cross-sectional study design . Community screen asymptomatic case and/or case clinically diagnose malaria admit out-patient unit health center , screen Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency ( G6PD ) malaria illness rapid diagnostic test P. vivax infection confirm light microscopy . Following treatment artemether-lumefantrine ( Coartem ) , G6PD normal child enrol study follow 2 month . Primaquine treatment allocate study participant step-wise design ; firstly receive current 14 day treatment regimen 0.5 mg/kg total dose ( n=40 ) ; secondly , 7 day treatment regimen receive total dose 1.0 mg/kg/day ; thirdly , receive 1.0 mg/kg twice daily dose ( bd ) total 3.5 day , 7 day treatment prove safe well tolerate . In addition dose-escalation study , pharmacokinetic profile single dos 0.5 mg/kg 1.0 mg/kg determine use intensive sample protocol , child age 5-10 year . The pharmacokinetic profile obtain sub-study essential model population pharmacokinetic data obtain dose-escalation study . As currently data safety , tolerability efficacy primaquine child , present study validate previous observation contribute knowledge primaquine treatment liver stag Plasmodium vivax infection .</brief_summary>
