	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare accuracy measurement derive commercially available direct intra-oral scanning system take plaster study model , compare cost implication system . The investigator test hypothesis : - There systematic difference measurement take Trios scanner study model . - There difference cost produce digital model .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Accuracy Direct Digital Intra-oral Scanning Measurements Compared Measurements Study Models</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plaster study model produce mould teeth standard component orthodontic record . They fundamental diagnosis treatment planning , evaluation treatment progress result well record keep . ( Santoro et al. , 2003 ) Plaster model must retain minimum 11 year medico legal reason . This lead problem storage term space cost , addition risk damage brittle nature model . These problem therefore highlight need alternative method produce store study model . This study aim compare accuracy measurement derive new commercially available direct intra-oral ( inside mouth ) scanning system ( 3Shape TRIOS ( R ) ) take plaster study model , compare cost implication system . We use result conclude whether direct intraÂ¬oral scan replace traditional plaster model produce mould teeth .</detailed_description>
