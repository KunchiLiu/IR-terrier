	<brief_summary>The risk diabetic kidney complication include non-modifiable risk factor genetic predictor , well modifiable risk factor hyperglycaemia , hypertension , hyperlipidaemia proteinuria . Genetic test personalized medicine increase popularity , though evidence genetic test empower patient modify behaviour reduce clinical risk remain lack . In project , investigator aim utilize personalize risk counsel genetic test evaluate impact risk factor control diabetic patient . The investigator hypothesize knowledge genetic +/- clinical risk empower patient lead improvement number treatment target achieve . The investigator recruit 400 patient diabetes . All subject undergo comprehensive assessment risk diabetic complication base clinical risk factor . Half patient randomize receive additional genetic testing panel genetic marker proven predict renal complication population : ACE I/D , aldose reductase ( CA ) n PRKCB1 gene polymorphism . The result personalize risk assessment communicate health counsellor intervention arm . The impact test patient knowledge result genetic testing achievement treatment target ( A1c , BP , LDL-cholesterol , TG , use ACEI/ARB ) patient behavior evaluate 12 month . The arm receive result genetic test completion study period . The study help towards develop strategy empower patient structure personalize risk assessment provide novel approach identify high-risk subject early intensive management , may lead reduction long-term complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asia midst epidemic diabetes . Approximately 1 10 people China diabetes [ 1 ] . Asian patient diabetes characterize early age onset increase risk kidney complication . Young age onset long disease duration place Chinese diabetic patient high risk complication . In Hong Kong Diabetes Registry , include 7000 patient type 2 diabetes , report high risk diabetic complication , 30 % die sustained major clinical event within 10years diagnosis , include 10 % develop cardiovascular complication , 10 % develop end-stage renal disease [ 2 ] [ 3 ] . The medical cost diabetic patient complication 2.2-3.8 fold patient without complication , patient cardiorenal complication costly manage [ 4 ] . Using registry , identify clinical risk predictor develop renal complication glycaemic control , elevate blood pressure , hyperlipidaemia , albuminuria [ 2 ] [ 3 , 5 ] , derive clinical risk prediction algorithms incorporate patient management portal , generate standardized report risk counsel base clinical risk factor [ 6 , 7 ] . Furthermore , multi-centre study utilize multidisciplinary team , find intensive management aim achieve target A1c , lipid , BP significantly reduce risk develop kidney complication [ 8 ] . Therefore , ability identify subject risk complication , target motivate optimize modifiable risk factor diabetic complication clinical benefit potentially cost-saving . There much recent interest use genetic test personalized medicine [ 9 ] . Diabetic kidney complication high heritability around 40 % several genetic factor find associate diabetic renal complication . Using candidate-gene approach , group identify several genetic marker diabetic kidney complication [ 10 , 11 ] [ 12 ] . These include angiotensin convert enzyme deletion/ insertion ( ACE D/I ) polymorphism aldose reductase ( ALR2 ) 5'- ( CA ) n microsatellite polymorphism , associate 2-3 fold increase risk diabetic cardio-renal complication Chinese [ 10 , 13 ] . More recently , find carrier risk allele protein kinase C-β1 ( PRKCB1 ) locus 6-fold increase risk develop end-stage renal disease follow-up , adjust effect clinical risk predictor [ 12 ] . The recent increase consumer-initiated genetic test driven direct-to-consumer genetic testing , assume personal genetic information motivate positive behavioural change patient [ 14 ] . Interestingly , recent survey patient without type 2 diabetes suggest genetic testing may able motivate patient , 71 % respondent report would `` much motivate '' make behavioural change inform high genetic risk diabetes [ 15 ] . Although evidence genetic test lead behavioural change still lack , several randomize clinical trial currently underway examine impact genetic test behaviour reduce risk diabetes . Given disable consequence diabetic complication , ability predict risk develop complication , plan examine role personalize risk counsel incorporate genetic marker , examine role patient empowerment risk factor control , may help reduce risk develop complication .</detailed_description>
