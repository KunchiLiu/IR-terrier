	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Afatinib Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With Resistance Erlotinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) give combination afatinib ( afatinib dimaleate ) patient advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) activate mutation progressive disease erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess preliminary manner efficacy combination ( response rate , disease control rate progression free survival ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine exploratory manner change program death-ligand ( PD-L ) 1 expression tumor microenvironment immune correlate blood tumor microenvironment induce afatinib concurrent MK-3475 versus MK-3475 precede combination afatinib/MK-3475 . II . To determine exploratory manner change EGFR-mutant plasma deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) response treatment MK-3475 afatinib . OUTLINE : This dose de-escalation study pembrolizumab . Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I ( DOSE DE-ESCALATION COHORT ) : Patients receive afatinib dimaleate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . ARM II ( EXPANSION COHORT ) : Patients receive pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 2 course . Beginning course 3 , patient receive afatinib dimaleate PO pembrolizumab IV Arm I . In Arms , course repeat every 21 day ( 2 year pembrolizumab ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 12 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
