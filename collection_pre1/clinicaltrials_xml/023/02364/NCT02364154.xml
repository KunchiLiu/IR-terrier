	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer one common deadliest cancer worldwide . Since tumor stage time diagnosis critical determinant patient outcome , early detection colorectal cancer screen modality hold key improve patient survival . However , current test , i.e . fecal occult blood test colonoscopy , inadequate first line screen colorectal cancer due limit accuracy low participation rate , respectively . Therefore , urgent need new accurate test use en masse screen colorectal cancer . A blood-based test represent promise alternative take little time , pose minimal risk patient , therefore likely lead high participation rate . The development effective blood-based screen tool base identification biomarkers blood sensitive specific colorectal cancer . Studying metabolic phenotype colorectal cancer may help identify biomarkers since metabolism cancer cell know differ significantly normal cell . More specifically , entire metabolism cancer cell reprogrammed increase anabolic reaction favor cell growth cell survival . The hypothesis present study metabolic phenotyping blood plasma allow ( ) discriminate colorectal cancer patient control subject ( ii ) identify new biomarkers colorectal cancer . In order test hypothesis , The investigator apply proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1H-NMR ) spectroscopy perform metabolic phenotyping blood plasma 50 colorectal cancer patient 50 control subject . Multivariate statistic perform assess discriminative power apply methodology distinguish group identify metabolite potential biomarkers colorectal cancer .</detailed_description>
