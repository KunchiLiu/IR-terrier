	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Rosuvastatin Atorvastatin Pediatric Dyslipidemia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trial Design Investigational Agents : Rosuvastatin 10mg tablet ( age 8-21 year ) ; oral dosing Atorvastatin 10mg tablet ( age 8-21 year ) ; oral dose Commercial supply rosuvastatin atorvastatin FDA approve use pediatric dyslipidemia use . Rosuvastatin atorvastatin source lot use subject . Dose Rationale : The dos designate choose accord previous pediatric data13,14 , consistent current labeling rosuvastatin atorvastatin child great 10 year age . The rosuvastatin atorvastatin dose label participant 8-10 year age , consistent current practice . Data study intend used change drug labeling , thus new IND require . Although fixed dos within pre-specified age range use , dose data analyze correct weight ( mg/kg ) base patient 's weight time dose . Risk/Benefits : All eligible subject LDL &gt; 130mg/dl ( 95 % percentile ) meet current clinical criterion statin therapy . The risk associate participation single-dose pharmacokinetic study expect minimal give known adverse event profile study article also , limited exposure . The common mild adverse effect statins headache , myalgia , gastrointestinal symptom ( abdominal pain , dyspepsia , diarrhea , constipation ) . However , child adverse effect occur frequency placebo7,10,25 . Rare adverse effect include elevation hepatic transaminase myopathy , generally observe chronic treatment . Furthermore , case hepatic failure statin report date10 . There also small risk associate placement intravenous ( IV ) catheter use draw serial blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis screening/safety lab . Finally , risk loss confidentiality participate subject . Methods protect PHI data handle specifically outline CMH CPR protocol Sections 4 &amp; 5 ( CMH IRB # 12040220 ) . All risk associate non-therapeutic clinical trial minimal . There direct benefit participate subject , although may benefit child future , expect information gain study generalize large population pediatric patient may require statin treatment . The purpose study determine genetic variation impact rosuvastatin atorvastatin plasma concentration follow recommended dos drug patient population previously study . Thus , knowledge , future protocol could subsequently develop effectively `` personalize '' dose pediatric subject aforementioned SNPs take rosuvastatin atorvastatin , thereby improve efficacy safety individual patient . Study Design/Type : This single center , open-label , randomize , crossover pilot study patient dyslipidemia compare pharmacokinetics rosuvastatin atorvastatin patient great equal one variant allele SLCO1B1 gene ( -11187 and/or c.521 ) patient wild-type/wild-type genotype . The result genetic test disclosed subject . Population Sample : The CMH Cardiology Pharmacogenomics Repository ( CPR ) ( CMH IRB # 12040220 ) database access determine subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . The study population aforementioned IRB proposal already agree contact future study . Once target population equal set age , sex- , race- Tanner Stage-matched control identify , patient invite participate . Subject Recruitment : Once target population equal set age- , sex- Tanner Stage-matched control identify CPR , prospective participant inform study . Initial contact occur way prepare telephone script ( Appendix 2 &amp; 3 ) . Those agree participate schedule visit Pediatric Clinical Research Unit ( PCRU ) screen visit . At visit , study explain patient/patient 's family , permission/assent/consent ( Appendix 4 &amp; 5 ) obtain , physical examination ( include Tanner stag ) , screen laboratory test perform . Participants permission/assent/consent obtain inclusion criterion meet , schedule come back PCRU first study drug day . If participant currently statin , schedule come back least 6 day Study Drug Day # 1 ( washout period ) . This visit need conduct follow minimum 6 day 14 day participant . If participant currently statin schedule anytime screen visit complete . The visit consist physical examination , lab test , placement indwell venous cannula serial blood draw outline administration single oral dose rosuvastatin atorvastatin . The total amount blood drawn ( screen lab PK sample ) trial 60.6 ml , well within guideline place CMH ORI child &gt; 25 kg . This study require overnight stay PCRU order obtain necessary plasma level . Following minimum 6 day 14 day study day # 1 ( washout period ) , participate subject bring back PCRU another single dose pharmacokinetic study involve second drug procedure sample scheme conduct study day # 1 .</detailed_description>
