	<detailed_description>Subject eligibility determine Screening evaluation . Screening evaluation include review inclusion exclusion criterion , medical Ob-Gyn history ; full physical gynecological examination ( include vulvar-vaginal examination ) ; Pap smear ; vital sign ( supine ) ; orthostatic blood pressure heart rate ; laboratory assessment ( chemistry , hematology , prothrombin time , FSH urinalysis ) ; concomitant medication use ; electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ; serology hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) antibody , sexually transmit infection ( syphilis , gonorrhea , chlamydia ) , Herpes ( HSV-2 ) human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibodies ; urine drug screen . The Screening visit occur 28 day Day 1 . For dose level , safety first 2 subject dose evaluated prior dose remainder subject dose level . If result indicate safety issue ( define know occurrence event orthostatic hypotension ( 8 hour post dose ) and/or score 0 use 4 point Vulvar-vaginal Irritation Scale first 2 subject , additional 2 subject dose safety data evaluate . If additional safety problem find , remain subject dose level . If safety issue find second 2 subject dose , dose occur prior dose level consider maximum tolerate dose . In addition , subject experience orthostatic hypotension point study vulvar-vaginal irritation score 0 use 4 point Vulvar-vaginal Irritation Scale dose level withdrawn study proceed next level . An additional review safety data upon completion dose level do determine dose escalation warrant . Safety decision make Principal Investigator ( PI ) Medical Monitor base clinical judgment . The first day dose consider Day 1 . Subjects house clinic duration Treatment Period allow collection PK sample 32 hour post-dose completion discharge procedure .</detailed_description>
