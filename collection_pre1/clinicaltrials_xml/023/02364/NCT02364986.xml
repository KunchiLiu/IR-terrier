	<brief_summary>There two standard second line treatment RRMS . Since disease cure exist treatment treatment option significant limitation , need develop new treatment strategy improve therapy patient RRMS . We develop RIG-I ligand new therapeutic strategy patient MS . The RIG-I ligand function partially via induction Interferon beta ( IFN-b ) , advantage therapy recombinant IFN-b . Identification suitable biomarkers monitor treatment RIG-I ligand guide dose step would help increase safety volunteer early clinical trial RIG-I ligand . The RESI study design analyse immune readout potential biomarkers type I IFN level , type I IFN dependent immune activation miRNA expression follow Rebif Avonex ( Interferon beta 1a ) application . Rebif apply s.c. dose 44 µg three time week ( day 1,3,5 8 ) , Avonex i.m . dose 30µg week ( day 1 8 ) , routinely use RRMS-therapy . The immune readout assess day 1 , 3 , 5 8 immediately application Rebif/Avonex day 1 8 1 / 6 / 12 /24 hr Rebif/Avonex application analyse blood sample . Since study RIG-I ligand start healthy volunteer continue MS patient need data population since could show significant difference response IFN-b . Thus , RESI study include healthy volunteer , RRMS-patients already Rebif/Avonex treatment , RRMS-patients yet start therapy Rebif/Avonex .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study subject receive either Rebif Avonex . Rebif apply s.c. dose 44 µg day 1 , day 3 , day 5 day 8 , Avonex i.m . dose 30µg day 1 8 . Blood sample take application day 1 8 1 / 6 / 12 /24 hr Rebif/Avonex application analyse occur immune response . The total duration trial individual subject 9 day . An MRI ist perform first application IMP end study investigate correlation Rebif/Avonex application depression .</detailed_description>
