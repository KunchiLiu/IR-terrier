	<brief_title>Evaluation Feasibility Effects Kinect-based Computer Games UE Training Tool Cerebral Palsy Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Children cerebral palsy ( CP ) usually various limitation function upper limb . Upper limbs function train one important issue CP rehabilitation . There grow interest rehabilitation specialist integrate commercialize interactive computer play rehabilitation program . According literature research , commercialize interactive computer play could improve speed quality movement , hand upper limb function , result mix . The investigator think interactive computer play could feasible upper limb training among child CP . However , investigator integrate rehabilitation training concept computer play order get good outcome training . The electronic expert rehabilitation expert work together reach goal . Therefore , aim study 1.to design Kinect computer game rehabilitation train tool upper limbs child CP , 2. assess feasibility effect Kinect computer game . Methods The investigator spend around nine month design computer game . The investigator search internet download computer game copy-right issue . The investigator use Kinect sensor catch child 's motion . The rehabilitation team choose several upper limb motion common use training child CP . Then Professor Chang 's team modify software design make target motion game control actions.When prototype game create , investigator invite two four child CP pilot test game . The game design complete till child therapist satisfy design . Within one year three month investigator randomize control trial compare effect Kinect game traditional occupational therapy ( OT ) upper limb function child CP . The investigator recruit 30 child randomize two group . In intervention section intervention group receive computer game train 30 minute 30 minute traditional OT . The control group receive traditional OT 1 hour . There 3 section 1 week ; intervention period 8 week . Statistic method Inter-group difference baseline characteristic evaluate use independent test Wilcoxon rank sum test Ï‡2 analysis . Analysis variance repeat measure use determine effect intervention dependent variable . Model effect group , time , interaction .</detailed_description>
