	<brief_summary>This prospective study analyze outcome provisional main vessel stenting side branch utilize Two-Dimensional ( 2D ) Three-Dimensional ( 3D ) frequency domain optical coherence tomography ( FD-OCT ) . To analyze fate side-branch provisional main vessel stenting base morphology define prior PCI OCT. Offline analysis side branch impingement ostium SB lead acute loss SB diameter area , carina shift plaque shift also perform .</brief_summary>
