	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic hepatitis B cause virus infects liver . Cure possible virus control use antiviral medicine , . Researchers think add second antiviral medicine might help . Objective : - To understand peginterferon might help treat people chronic hepatitis B . Also , see peginterferon safe use antiviral medication . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 old chronic hepatitis B therapy 1 oral medicine hepatitis B least 4 year . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They complete health questionnaire level fatigue pain . They blood urine test . They may eye exam . - Participants also Fibroscan . A test measure stiff liver . - Eligible participant liver biopsy . Blood drawn . - Participants admit NIH Clinical Center . They inject study drug . Then second liver biopsy . They discharge 24 hour later . - Participants give study drug injection skin weekly 24 week . - Participants 5 clinic visit 24-week treatment period . Then follow-up visit every 12 week 48 week . - During visit , participant may physical exam medical history . They may blood urine test . They may Fibroscan complete questionnaire . At final visit , also Fibroscan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms Associated With Favorable Responses Peginterferon-Alpha Add-on Therapy Following Long-term Nucleos ( ) Ide Analogue Treatment Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection lead cause liver associate morbidity mortality . Currently available first-line therapy treatment chronic hepatitis B include pegylated interferon-alpha nucleos ( ) ide analogue ( NUCs ) entecavir tenofovir . These show effectively suppress viral replication , ability induce durable off-treatment response limit small subset patient . Combination treatment peginterferon NUCs attempt several randomize controlled trial , apparent advantage either agent give alone . In study however , treatment peginterferon initiate either simultaneously shortly NUCs administration . The efficacy peginterferon follow long-term viral suppression NUCs test one small pilot study , nevertheless show 60 % HBsAg loss rate . The underlying mechanism responsible improve efficacy peginterferon set unknown warrant investigation . In single arm study propose evaluate efficacy mechanism associate response peginterferon add-on therapy follow minimum 192 week viral suppression induce NUCs group chronic HBV infect patient . Sixty patient either HBeAg positive ( n=30 ) negative ( n=30 ) chronic HBV infection enrol study . After medical evaluation pretreatment liver biopsy , treatment subcutaneous injection pegylated interferon alpha-2a 180 g per week give total 24 week , follow off-treatment evaluation period 48 week . A second liver biopsy perform six hour follow first peginterferon injection . Primary end-point study change interferon-stimulated-genes response first interferon injection responder versus non-responders treatment . The responsiveness IFN-based therapy treatment responder vs nonresponders additionally evaluate study intrahepatic peripheral blood natural killer cell . The study also assess HBeAg HBsAg loss seroconversion rate comparison historical control treat either peginterferon NUCs monotherapy . Finally , ass whether treatment responder develop HBV-specific T cell response similar quantity quality patient spontaneously resolve HBV infection .</detailed_description>
