	<brief_title>Effect Hypothyroidism Brown Adipose Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothyroidism frequent endocrine disorder , prevalence subclinical disease 4.3 % overt disease 0.3 % . Patients suffer hypothyroidism frequently complain increased cold sensitivity involuntary weight gain , indicate change energy expenditure response cold challenge . Recently , brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) regain attention energy expend tissue . While previously think negligible relevance human adult , recent study clearly demonstrate presence metabolic activity BAT human adult . Upon activation BAT sympathetic nervous system intracellular lipid store rapidly deplete . The generated free fatty acid fuel beta-oxidation respiratory chain within mitochondrion activate time uncouple protein 1 ( UCP1 ) . This protein act protonophore , allow flux proton along electrochemical gradient inner mitochondrial matrix instead transfer energy adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) -synthase . The short circuiting oxidative phosphorylation within mitochondrion lead highly active cellular respiration generation heat . Basic research highlight importance thyroid hormone development function BAT . It recently show hyperthyroidism exerts activate effect BAT adult human . The investigator aim study whether hypothyroidism negatively affect BAT function human whether BAT function restore normal thyroid hormone supplementation .</detailed_description>
