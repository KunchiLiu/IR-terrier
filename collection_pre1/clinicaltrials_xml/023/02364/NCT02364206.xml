	<brief_summary>Glioblastomas extremely resistant treatment , include radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy . Mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) cascade key signal pathway involve regulation normal cell proliferation , survival differentiation . Activation p38 MAPK associate poor prognosis among patient glioblastoma temozolomide ( TMZ ) era represent compensatory response tumor cell environmental stress radiation chemotherapy . LY2228820 potent selective inhibitor p38 MAPK , reduce phosphorylation cellular target , MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 ( MAPKAPK-2 ) . LY2228820 good candidate target malignant glioma resistance gold standard treatment combine radiation TMZ act tumor stromal cell . The primary objective study determine recommend dose LY2228820 combination TMZ radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy period ( phase I ) estimate 6-month progression free survival ( PFS ) rate patient treat LY2228820 administer recommend dose combination radiotherapy concomitant TMZ ( phase II )</brief_summary>
