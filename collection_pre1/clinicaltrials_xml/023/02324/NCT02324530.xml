	<brief_summary>This clinical study patient compare effect CPAP lung volume diaphragm motion , heart position tumor motion compare free breathing . Only patient significant tumor motion great 1 cm amplitude unfavorable chest wall geometry ( heart close chest wall ) identify standard image simulation candidate study . Patients re- simulated plan radiation treatment CPAP . The radiation plan generate without CPAP compare evaluate impact CPAP tumor motion dose deliver adjacent critical structure heart lung .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives - Evaluate effectiveness CPAP reproducibly reduce tumor organ motion radiation therapy treatment . - Determine CPAP allow reduction normal tissue receive radiation chest abdomen tumor reduce heart exposure patient receive leave breast irradiation . Entry Criteria : This proof concept feasibility study . We propose study 10 patient group total thirty patient . Eligibility criterion Group1 . Lung tumor nodules tumor motion great 1 cm standard imaging ( n=10 ) Group2 . Left side breast tumor unfavorable anatomy , viz heart abut chest wall ( n=10 ) Group3 . Upper abdominal tumor : Liver Pancreas tumor motion great 1 cm . ( n=10 ) Pretreatment evaluations/management patient meet eligibility criterion CPAP All patient evaluate pulmonologist respiratory performance include physical examination , oxygen saturation pulmonary function test include DLCO serve baseline measure . Then , adjustment session perform aim get adjust CPAP device till maximal tolerated pressure 16 cmH20 ( TBD ) 30 minute . All patient must able tolerate CPAP comply daily treatment . 4D CT : CT simulation basis conformal treatment plan [ 24 , 25 ] . By use slow acquisition time 3 minute motion effect due breathe capture 4D image generate . The tumor position image throughout breathe cycle Maximum Intensity Projection ( MIP ) construct used treatment planning . If tumor motion size MIP would equal tumor size . The MIP size increase increase tumor motion . The planning software allow u calculate MIP dimension volume . In addition total lung volume change diaphragm position calculate ( Figure 1 ) . Radiation therapy planning parameter volumetric analysis tumor normal tissue motion position calculate use available software transfer Eclipse treatment planning system [ 17 ] . Treatment Planning : The Eclipse treatment planning system use generate compare plan treatment without CPAP . Details Intervention Simulation All treatment plan CPAP evaluation do radiation therapy department . Patients simulate Phillips 4D big bore CT simulator . The 4D scan do slowly several minute allow u ass full range tumor motion throughout respiratory cycle . An ITV calculate include actual tumor size expansion account range motion tumor account tumor location throughout respiratory cycle ( MIP ) The MIP basis ITV structure use treatment planning . Patients recruit study re-simulated patient position undergo CPAP treatment . ITV size volume calculate tumor standard CPAP study use planning . RPM : Diaphragm motion respiratory cycle information obtain use RPM standard CPAP simulation . Differences respiratory wave cycle record [ 17 ] . The MIP/ITV image transfer Eclipse treatment planning system use standard breathe CPAP simulation treatment plan generate . Standard radiation plan evaluation parameter use plan compare respect tumor coverage normal tissue normal tissue radiation field . Radiation Plan : Identical field arrangement generate CPAP non CPAP plan . Plans evaluate use standard radiation therapy planning parameter include : MIP ITV , total lung volume , volume GTV/CTV/PTV/ V20 MLD . Pre treatment Compare standard conformal radiation plan use Eclipse treatment planning system patient without CPAP . RPM tracing without CPAP compare group pre- treatment .</detailed_description>
