	<brief_title>Non-Ambulatory SCI Walk Using Robotic Exoskeleton : Effect Bone Muscle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , treatment muscle bone deterioration SCI limit ; therefore , definite need understand mechanism breakdown musculoskeletal system SCI , , importantly , find clinical strategy treat muscle bone loss . This pilot research grant collect result use design multi-site randomize controlled clinical trial determine whether Robotic Exoskeleton training [ 100 session ; 1hr/session ; 4-5 sessions/week ] improve musculoskeletal outcome current intervention . If overall objective use progression technology enhance functional ambulation person spinal cord injury , investigator need evaluate health benefit associate continual use device . The study prospective , single-group , repeated measure design use 2 -month lead establish stability , 5-month intervention phase 2 -month follow-up phase retention perform . Each participant use control . This project complete two site : Kessler Foundation lead site direction Dr. Gail F Forrest ( Principal Investigator ) Spinal Cord Damage Research Center , James J Peters VA Medical Center direction Dr. Ann M. Spungen ( collaborator ) . Both sit exoskeletal-assisted walking program .</detailed_description>
