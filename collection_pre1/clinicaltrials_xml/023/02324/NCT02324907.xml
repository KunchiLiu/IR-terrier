	<brief_title>The Use Dynamic Compression Intramedullary Nail Tibiotalocalcaneal Arthrodesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposal collaborative effort MedShape . This prospective investigation assess clinical outcome patient tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis Dynamic Compression Intramedullary Nail ( DynaNail ) . We plan enrol 30 patient . The assignment device discretion standard care provider , study investigator . Patients end-stage tibiotalar ( ankle ) talocalcaneal ( subtalar ) joint arthritis etiology ask enroll study . After informed consent , patient ask complete follow patient report outcomes questionnaire ( standard care patient Foot Ankle section ) : 100mm VAS pain , Short form-36 ( SF-36 ) , Foot Ankle Ability Measure ( FAAM ) . After informed consent , schedule surgery routine fashion . REDCap database use allow on-line data entry . The following surgical procedure step follow-ups standard care Duke University . The surgical procedure involve tibiotalar talocalcaneal joint preparation approach ( lateral , posterior , anterior sinus tarsus ) . The use supplemental bone graft discretion treat surgeon must document . The MedShape DynaNail insert accord manufacturer 's technique . The patient place short leg splint keep non-weight bearing . The patient discharge hospital medically ready follow-up two week . At two week , patient return clinic standard care visit splint remove . A non-weight bearing lateral radiograph hind foot take assess amount travel compressive element . This radiograph standard care . The patient place non-weight bearing cast . The patient ask return two week ( 4 week post-operatively ) . This visit standard care . At time another non-weight bearing lateral radiograph take assess amount travel compressive element . The patient ask return 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month , 24 month surgery standard care surgery . At 3 month , CT scan obtain assess healing . This standard care Duke University . At time-points , patient specific outcome questionnaire administer . For non- standard care radiograph patient ask take urine pregnancy test prior radiographs take . Patients identify clinic attend orthopaedic foot ankle surgeon physician assistant base clinical exam radiographic finding . Inclusion criterion include anyone age 18 ankle subtalar arthritis fail nonoperative management . Typically , patient multiple medical comorbidities therefore exclusion criterion patient healthy enough undergo surgery . Patients racial , religious , cultural background include study . Approximately 30 patient recruit study .</detailed_description>
