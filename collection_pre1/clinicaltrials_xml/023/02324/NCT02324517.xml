	<brief_summary>Therapy patient severe hemophilia ( include hemophilia inhibitor ) severe bleed disorder could monitor guide base upon special clotting assay , eg thrombin generation thromboelastography . In study blood sample patient bleed disorder evaluate apply ex- vivo spike assay various coagulation concentrate potentially address feasibility replacement /bypass agents/ combine therapy future bleed episode . Patients treat regimen potentially suggest ( standard care- within trial ) thereafter follow , include repeat lab study assess impact therapy upon hemostasis .</brief_summary>
