	<brief_title>Automatic Physiotherapy Rehabilitation System Lower Body Total Joint Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many task perform regularly physiotherapist give rehabilitation session repetitive rely physiotherapist 's expertise , could perform observe automated mean . The developed system detect patient body posture movement data collect sensor accelerometer . This data pattern match predetermined movement pattern feedback provide patient regard accuracy exercise . This data log physiotherapist examine late time . By automate component rehabilitation session , system allow physiotherapist focus diagnosis task well utilize training . The specific application prototype post-operative knee/hip replacement patient , device must non-invasive must interfere normal recovery process . A previous version experiment healthy participant successfully perform . This study would like examine feasibility system rehabilitation subject , movement pattern subject physical rehabilitation may dramatically different healthy subject . No intervention suggest system , study observational .</detailed_description>
