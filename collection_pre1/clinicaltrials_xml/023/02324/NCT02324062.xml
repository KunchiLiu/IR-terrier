	<brief_summary>This study understand use genetic test ( Myriad Genetics myRisk panel ) analyze 25 gene relate different hereditary cancer condition . The investigator hope learn type genetic test use clinically . The investigator also hope understand experience individual family undergo test genetic testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If patient identify fulfil one screening criterion , possible participant refer Cancer Genetics Clinic evaluation possible enrollment study . A pre-clinic questionnaire send patient prior assessment cancer genetics clinic order obtain baseline information use inform change follow-up . Assessments perform exclusively determine eligibility study do obtain informed consent . Assessments perform clinical indication ( exclusively determine study eligibility ) may use baseline value even study do informed consent obtain . All screening procedure must perform day registration unless otherwise state . The screening procedure include : 1 . Medical history -Complete medical surgical history , family history include multi-generation family pedigree , social history 2 . Demographics - Age , gender , race , ethnicity 3. Review subject eligibility criterion 4 . Physical exam include vital sign , height weight 5 . Blood draw correlative study 6 . DNA whole blood isolate Intervention Procedure : Approximately 15 ml blood drawn time enrollment ( one time blood draw ) send Myriad Genetics Laboratories analysis 25 gene use next generation sequence . This platform sequence 25 gene one experimental run result send back cancer genetics clinic interpretation disclosure . Randomization patient Population : After result give patient randomize 4 group : - Patients identify mutation gene commonly test prior advent multiplex panel test . This exclude BRCA1 , BRCA2 , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , EPCAM , APC , MYH unless patient test positive one 9 gene meet clinical criterion underlie syndrome ( Stanford accrual goal 62/USC 62 ) - Patients identify variant unknown significance ( VUS ) gene nonBRCA ( BRCA1 BRCA2 ) non-Lynch syndrome gene ( MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 EPCAM ) . Stanford target accrual 50 50 USC . - Patients test negative gene test . Target goal 50 Stanford/50 USC study . - All participant meet criterion fall one group target goal meet group . Only participants 1st three group ask complete questionnaire duration study ( 60 month enrollment ) Follow-up Procedures : Patients ( note ) follow 3 month , 6 month , 12 month , 24 month , 36 month , 48 month , 60 month â€¢ At 3 month 6 month disclosure genetic testing result , follow questionnaire ask participant initiate intend undergo follow risk reduce intervention and/or treatment : ( ) Cancer surveillance/screening : breast MRI , mammogram , self-breast examination , thyroid ultrasound , dermatology exam , urinalysis , upper endoscopy , colonoscopy , endometrial biopsy , transvaginal ultrasound , image ( i.e . whole body rapid MRI ) ( ii ) Chemoprevention/Behavior Modification : Tamoxifen , Oral Contraceptives ( OCP ) , Raloxifene , Sulindac , Abstinence Smoking ( iii ) Prophylactic procedure : Mastectomy , TAHBSO , polypectomy , total segmental colectomy ( iv ) Cancer Treatment : aggregate pharmacologic radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
