	<brief_title>King Vision Video Laryngoscope Versus Glidescope Video Laryngoscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both King Vision Glidescope video laryngoscope advance airway device relatively low cost design improve efficiency routine difficult intubation . Both system use disposable blade , eliminates need blade sterilization may minimize risk infectious exposure patient improve cost efficiency associate sterilization process non-disposable laryngoscope . The Glidescope commercially available longer King Vision , frequently study . Although similar many respect , King Vision Glidescope system differ design may result difference speed success management routine and/or difficult airway .</detailed_description>
