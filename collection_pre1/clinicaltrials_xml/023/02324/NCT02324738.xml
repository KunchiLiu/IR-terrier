	<brief_summary>This open-label sequential pharmacokinetic study 16 healthy glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) normal Thai subject Faculty Tropical medicine , Mahidol university . The 16 subject already participate healthy volunteer study past either ) Open-Label Study Evaluate Potential Pharmacokinetic Interaction Orally Administered primaquine dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHA-PQP ) Healthy Adult Subjects ii ) Comparison electrocardiographic effect relation Pharmacokinetic profile chloroquine piperaquine healthy Thai subject Every subject administer single dose three tablet DHA-PQP previous study . To avoid unnecessary exposure DHA-PQP , propose include result DHA-PQP arm previous study ask healthy subject participate study receive single dose three tablet DHA-PQP ( 40mg/320mg ) two tablet Mefloquine ( 250mg ) first admission single dose two tablet Mefloquine second admission .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Artemisinin resistance pose great threat current global initiative control eliminate malaria . The World Health Organisation recommend use artemisinin combination therapy ( one partner drug combine artemisinin back bone ) ( ACTs ) instead single drug . The reduction artemisinin sensitivity leave partner drug within ACTs expose much large number parasite unsurprisingly cure rate ACTs begin fall substantially . Recently , Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit ( MORU ) apply received funding extension TRAC project . The proposed extension project , name TRACII , map artemisinin partner drug resistance South-East Asian region . Also , TRACII aim investigate safety , pharmacokinetic characteristic efficacy novel combination artemisinin-derivative two long act partner drug , piperaquine mefloquine . It necessary potential drug-drug interaction mefloquine dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHA-PQP ) characterize . Piperaquine Mefloquine metabolize Cytochrome P450 3A4 ( abbreviate CYP3A4 ) enzyme potentially result clinically significant drug-drug interaction cause unanticipated adverse reaction therapeutic failure suboptimal drug exposure parasite . The study evaluate pharmacokinetic interaction safety profile focus cardiogenic effect ( QTc prolongation ) triple combination DHA-PQP mefloquine . Piperaquine Mefloquine metabolize Cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme potentially result clinically significant drug-drug interaction . These safety pharmacokinetic data translate support intervention Tracking Resistance Artemisinin Collaboration II ( TRACII ) project . This open-label sequential pharmacokinetic study 16 healthy G6PD normal Thai subject . The 16 subject participate healthy volunteer study past either ) Open-Label Study Evaluate Potential Pharmacokinetic Interaction Orally Administered primaquine dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine Healthy Adult Subjects ii ) Comparison electrocardiographic effect relation Pharmacokinetic profile chloroquine piperaquine healthy Thai subject administer single dose three tablet DHA-PQP . To avoid unnecessary exposure healthy subject study , propose include result previous study ask healthy subject participate regimen 1 onward . Subjects admit inpatient ward receive 2 drug regimen : regimen 1 ( Mefloquine DHA-PQP ) regimen 2 ( Mefloquine ) . Every subject 1 screen 2 admission hospital</detailed_description>
