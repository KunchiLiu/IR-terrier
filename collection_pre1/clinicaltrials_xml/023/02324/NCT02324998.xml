	<brief_summary>Despite recent advance treatment Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer ( CRPC ) , remain unmet medical need identify optimise additional treatment patient early prostate cancer great risk relapse follow first-line treatment curative intent . This phase I study investigate feasibility tolerability short course neoadjuvant treatment olaparib , either monotherapy combination degarelix ) give window-of-opportunity prior radical prostatectomy men early , localise intermediate-/high- risk prostate cancer . Our primary objective determine pharmacodynamic biomarker effect olaparib ( PARP inhibitor ) patient population . Participants receive either single agent olaparib olaparib combination degarelix ( androgen deprivation ) two week prior routine radical prostatectomy . We use immunohistochemistry quantify change level biomarkers PARP inhibition , e.g . PAR , gamma H2AX , pH2A ( s129 ) Rad51 focus , use tumour sample take baseline time radical prostatectomy . An intra-operative prostate biopsy permit u examine biomarker variability sample . The incidence severity Adverse Events document assess number trial participant undergo surgery schedule . We assess preliminary evidence tumour response , e.g . pathological change Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) . We also intend investigate change ctDNA profile compare blood sample collect throughout study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>To include trial patient must : Have give write informed consent participate* Men age 18 year Patients suitable radical prostatectomy ECOG performance status 0 1 Access archive diagnostic tissue consent undergo repeat biopsy , necessary Diagnosis High risk Intermediate risk prostate cancer , define : High risk disease : one stage T2c 3a , PSA level &gt; 20ng/mL , Gleason score ≥ 8 Intermediate risk disease : two : Stage T2 ( ) , PSA &gt; 10 , Gleason ≥ 7 Adequate bone marrow reserve organ function ( measure within 28 day prior plan first olaparib administration ) demonstrate follow value : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.8 x 109/L Haemoglobin ≥ 117g/L Platelet count ≥ 135 x 109/L WBC ≥ 3.6 x 109/L Peripheral blood smear feature MDS/AML Adequate hepatic function : Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) AND Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time ULN unless presence Gilbert 's syndrome elevate indirect fraction Adequate renal function : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 time ULN concurrent creatinine clearance ≥ 50mL/min ( calculate Cockcroft Gault equation ) Willing use two highly effective form contraception ( see section 11.8 ) throughout participation trial three month last dose olaparib . Patients must refrain donate sperm start dose sixteen week discontinue trial treatment Normal chest radiograph ( CXR ) oxygen saturation Patients currently/have recently involve nondrugbased research eligible participate If patient consent participate optional genetic research ( ctDNA study blood ) optional additional biopsy penalty loss benefit patient . The patient exclude aspect trial . The presence follow preclude patient inclusion : Contraindication olaparib degarelix History hypersensitivity active inactive excipients olaparib Patients know hypersensitivity degarelix active substance mannitol must receive degarelix . Current refractory nausea vomiting , chronic gastrointestinal disease , inability swallow formulate product previous significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption olaparib As judged Investigator , patient consider poor medical risk due serious uncontrolled medical disorder , nonmalignant systemic disease active , uncontrolled infection include limited : Uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia Recent myocardial infarction ( within three month ) Unstable spinal cord compression Superior vena cava syndrome Extensive bilateral lung disease High Resolution Computed Tomography ( HRCT ) History pneumonitis Active infection include hepatitis B , hepatitis C Human Immunodeficiency Virus . Screening chronic condition require . Major surgery within 4 week prior entry trial ( exclude placement vascular access ) . Patients must recover side effect major surgery . Minor surgery ( include diagnostic prostate biopsy ) within 2 week prior entry trial . Patients receive ( within last 3 month trial entry ) investigational drug within clinical trial eligible participate . Concomitant use know potent CYP3A4 inhibitor inducer . See section 10.4.1.1 list consider wash period . Blood transfusion within 1 month prior trial start ECG mean rest QTc ≥ 470ms ( Fridericia ; per local reading ) two time point within 24 hour period family history long QT syndrome Concomitant medication know prolong QT interval ( see Appendix 1 ) factor increase risk QTc prolongation risk arrhythmic event ( heart failure , hypokalaemia , congenital long QT syndrome , family history long QT syndrome unexplained sudden death 40 yearsofage ) , History Torsades de pointes . Judgement Investigator patient unsuitable participate trial patient unlikely comply trial procedure , restriction requirement Patients MDS AML , previous malignancy except patient undergone treatment curative intent prior malignancy evidence active prior malignancy eligible . With exception alopecia , unresolved toxicity prior chemotherapy great CTCAE ( version 4.03 ) Grade 1 time start olaparib treatment . Patients desire child follow trial recruit</criteria>
