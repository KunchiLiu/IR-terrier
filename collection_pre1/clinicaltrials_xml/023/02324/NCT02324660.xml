	<brief_summary>Several study registry suggest concomitant presence acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) significantly associate poor prognosis . It suggest diagnosis COPD frequently miss . Thus , plausible significant percentage patient ACS may unrecognized COPD . This miss diagnosis may contribute significantly poor prognosis . The investigator suppose concomitant use peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) measurement Respiratory Health Screening Questionnaire ( RHSQ , adapt version ) could useful screen test COPD patient smoker former smoker admit hospital diagnosis ACS . In screened patient COPD diagnosis confirm ( ) two month hospital discharge spirometry . In set patient , investigator characterize underlying pathological mechanism , evaluate several inflammation , platelet endothelial marker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) respectively first fourth lead cause death Western country . ACS COPD share several risk factor , particular smoking habitus . Available data may summarize follow : ) ACS , generally ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) , frequent comorbidity COPD patient ; ii ) cardiac adverse event frequent cause hospitalization and/or death COPD patient ; iii ) patient ACS concomitant COPD high risk mortality , re-infarction heart failure ( HF ) ; iv ) COPD frequently undiagnosed patient IHD . At best knowledge , study investigate effectiveness feasibility screening procedure early detect COPD ACS patient . The identification unrecognized COPD ACS patient may permit optimization treatment significant improvement outcome . Finally , well know several biological process involve development worsen IHD-COPD comorbidity ( e.g . inflammation , hypoxia , heighten platelet reactivity , endothelial dysfunction ) . Nevertheless , complete evaluation process currently miss . A good characterization biological process underlie ACS-COPD comorbidity may significantly improve management . HYPOTHESIS SIGNIFICANCE : Based previous study patient stable IHD , suppose least 30 % patient admitted hospital ACS undiagnosed COPD . They represent subgroup patient high risk death , reinfarction heart failure . We hypothesize combine use PEF RHSQ ( adapt version ) ACS patient ( smoker former smoker ) hospital discharge may discriminate undiagnosed COPD . The early diagnosis COPD comorbidity may important clinical implication . We speculate early identification undiagnosed COPD ACS patient may permit promptly treatment improve outcomes . Finally , suppose bad outcome observe ACS patient undiagnosed COPD well patient prior ACS acute exacerbation COPD due specific pattern alteration platelet reactivity ( PR ) , endothelial function ( EF ) inflammation . Therefore , characterization may lead improvement clinical management patient . METHODS : Blood sample : At time enrollment aliquot ( 7-10 ml ) whole blood collect store DNA RNA extraction . Blood sample obtain plasma ( 7-10 ml ) serum ( 7-10 ml ) collect time enrolment time spirometry . Screening procedure : PEF RHSQ ( adapt version ) administer independent combined team cardiologist pulmonologist hospital discharge . According international guideline , patient ask perform 3 consecutive PEF measurement high value record . A PEF value 80 % predict consider predictive impaired lung function . The RHSQ questionnaire perform previously report value &gt; 19 suggest high probability COPD . Spirometry : spirometry test perform 50-70 day hospital discharge ( enrollment time ) . Primary outcome study : endpoint study diagnosis COPD spirometry . The aim study establish combine use PEF RHSQ questionnaire able early predict COPD diagnosis . Clinical follow-up : complete 1-year follow-up collect patient record occurrence adverse event hospital admission . All adverse event adjudicate two independent reviewer blind screen spirometry outcome . Biological parameter : several evaluation inflammation , endothelial platelet function marker perform blood sample patient . The principal report : high sensitivity C-reactive protein , fibrinogen , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-1Ra , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha , platelet reactivity assess light transmission aggregometry VerifyNow system , ICAM Bcl-2 e-NOS ( extracellular nitric oxide synthase ) ( human umbilical vein endothelial cell incubate serum patient ) , intracellular level reactive oxygen specie . Secondary outcome : PEF , RHSQ , biological parameter spirometry result related clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
