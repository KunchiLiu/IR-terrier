	<detailed_description>Introduction Background : Colorectal carcinoma represent global health burden common cancer digestive tract . The lifetime risk develop colorectal carcinoma 5 % , overall number patient currently alive diagnosed disease Denmark estimate 30.000 patient . Approximately 70 % case involve colon , remain 30 % involve anus rectum . The mortality rate intimately relate high metastatic ability therefore prognosis strongly depend stage diagnosis . Angiogenesis : Angiogenesis play important role tumour growth metastatic potential attract lot attention past year , due possible implication prognosis stratification , well target treatment advanced colorectal cancer . Most cancer depend firmly development new capillary network allow nutrition newly form tumour cell . These newly develop blood vessel usually highly permeable allow access tumour cell general circulation , lead metastatic progression . Current treatment strategy patient advanced colorectal cancer include combine regimen cytotoxic biologic therapy target angiogenesis . Thus , great interest find alternative imaging test assess efficacy antiangiogenic agent earlier course therapy , base functional image tumour vascularity . The benefit see survival patient advanced disease treatment antiangiogenic drug maybe translate neoadjuvant setting adjuvant set patient stage III cancer high risk stage II cancer . Staging : Tumour describe TNM classification malignant tumour ( TNM ) . Accurate preoperative staging colon rectum cancer main factor determine treatment modality patient greatly influence result . Prognostication determination T stage colon tumours use compute tomography ( CT ) scan widely discuss literature . Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) suggest stag tool choice rectal cancer , compare CT , yet colonic cancer remain investigated . With Danish National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme , increase number early cancer reveal . During recent year local treatment patient rectal carcinoma situ T0 ( T1/T2N0M0 ) cancers become accepted open new avenue treatment old , comorbid way , vulnerable patient . As result screen programme clinician naturally place new dilemma term treatment choice , radical versus local excision , early colonic cancer . Important issue colonic cancer excision , intramural extent invasion presence absence lymphnode metastasis . EUS : Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) method consist ultrasound transducer mount tip endoscope . It evolve useful image intervention colon rectum . The investigator choose use radial-array endoscope 360o view evaluate colonic cancer , often present circumferential lesion . EUS ability depict layer GI wall proven method usefull stag GI cancer . Imaging blood flow vessel evaluation blood flow velocity flow direction carry use Doppler sonography . Further evaluation tumour perfusion also perform low-mechanical contrast enhance endoscopic ultrasound ( CE-EUS ) . This high-resolution technique enable minimally invasive evaluation tumour perfusion . According European Federation Societies Ultrasound Medicine Biology ( EFSUMB ) guideline , contrast enhanced-ultrasound ( CE-EUS ) utilize assess early response biologic therapy tumours metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumour ( GIST ) renal cell carcinoma hepatocellular carcinoma . A similar approach test yet CRC patient use CE-EUS . In Ph.D. study investigator choose focus leave sided colonic cancer , since constitute approximately 70 % colon cancer , technically , easy reach transverse tumour right side tumour , thereby make study feasible . The investigator define left side colonic cancer cancer include left flexure proximally 15 cm linea Dentata distally . Aims To examine EUS used stage assessment leave sided colon cancer investigate endoscopic ultrasound perfusion assessment correlate histopathological include immunohistochemical parameter tumour vascular marker . Project description The Ph.D. study consist 4 sub-studies . 1 . Endoscopic ultrasound assessment T-stage N-stage left-sided colonic cancer Hypothesis : EUS feasible stag method accurately determine T-stage N-stage left-sided tumour . Objectives : To investigate left-sided colonic cancer EUS especially concern muscular tumour invasion ( tunica muscularis ) detection rate local lymph node suspicious malignancy . Design : A prospective cohort study . Methods : Any patient Køge/Roskilde Herlev Hospital schedule surgery histologically determine left-sided colonic cancer include study undergo EUS evaluation . Patients undergo CT-scan stag preoperatively accord scan . Sensitivity specificity calculate EUS pathology specimen , regard muscular invasion . It expect , base previous publication , distribution patient `` bad '' tumour ( = T4 + T3 &gt; 5 mm muscular invasion ) `` good '' tumour ( = T1 - T3 &lt; 5 mm muscular invasion ) 45 % 55 % respectively . With 80 % power 5 % type 1 error investigator include 74 patient order expect sensitivity 90 % low boundary 95 % confidence interval 75 % . The investigator perform interim analysis inclusion 35 patient . If observed sensitivity 80 % study terminate focus method development . If sensitivity higher 80 % study inclusion continue inclusion 74 patient . Outcome : Outcome measure EUS stage compare histological stage well CT scan stage . 2 . The correlation endoscopic perfusion assessment immunohistochemical parameter leave sided colonic cancer Hypothesis : EUS feasible diagnostic modality determine vascular characteristic leave sided colonic cancer . Objectives : To investigate quantitative qualitative EUS parameter left-sided colonic cancer contrast enhanced EUS imaging . Design : A prospective cohort study . Methods : When EUS stag perform cohort study 2 , evaluation tumour perfusion do low-mechanical contrast enhance endoscopic ultrasound ( CE-EUS ) . Power Doppler vascularity index calculate used measure tumour perfusion . The volume tumour perfusion previously show strong correlation vascular density . The perfusion tumour tissue per cm3 ( automate pixel analysis ) compare histologically determine vascular density . The study explorative sample size calculation possible base present literature . Outcome : Outcome measure endoscopic ultrasound perfusion parameter correlate histopathological vascular characteristic left-sided colonic cancer ( e.g . micro vessel density measure CD31 stain double-staining technique ) . Risks side effect : Complications may occur EUS rare . These consist bleed tumour , since tumour mass may vulnerable , position scope . The bleed self-limited . Perforation bowel extremely rare . Making EUS stag procedure endoscopic perfusion assessment , , take 10-15 minute . SonoVue® nephrotoxic incidence hypersensitivity severe allergic event lower current X-ray agent comparable magnetic resonance contrast agent . SonoVue® approve clinical use EU country administration contrast agent show low incidence side effect . Location : The data collection take place Department Surgery , Endoscopy Units Herlev University Hospital Køge/Roskilde University Hospital . The endoscopy perform primarily Herlev Hospital also Køge Hospital necessary EUS equipment provide . If patient Køge Roskilde Hospital examine Herlev Hospital . The histopathological analysis follow standard protocol colorectal carcinoma routinely perform Departments Pathology Herlev University Hospital Roskilde University Hospital . Dissemination result : All result , positive , negative inconclusive present national international conference . The result submit publication peer-reviewed journal Marie Louise Malmstrøm first author . Sponsors : The research project initiate principal supervisor , Peter Vilmann , MD , DMSc . The cost associate project support principal supervisor 's department budget external funding . The EUS equipment already available endoscopy department Herlev funding equipment Køge/Roskilde Hospital apply Research Council Region Zealand . Funding salary clinical investigator apply private fund public fund . Ethics : The study ethically approve ( H-4-2014-075 ) approve datatilsynet . The study perform registered www.clinicaltrials.gov request ICMJE ( International Committee Medical Journal Editors ) . Research subject give informed consent , base write oral information inclusion study . Participants inform side-effects , risk unplanned event might occur implementation study . The minimal risk outweigh potential implication future patient care . The study carry respect mental physical integrity participant .
