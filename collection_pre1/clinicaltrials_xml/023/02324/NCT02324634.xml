	<brief_summary>Stroke large cause adult disability United Kingdom . Loss hand function , muscle weakness , pain , joint deformity persistent disable problem nearly half stroke survivor . This , part , result patient get adequate therapy target hand arm early stage rehabilitation . Previous research highlight importance early rehabilitation intervention stroke . Although stroke patient damage brain rather limbs , muscle wastage ( atrophy ) occur soon stroke non-use . Muscle atrophy even occur retain degree active arm movement . Electrical stimulation ( ES ) painless treatment small pulse electrical current battery operate portable device use activate paralyse muscle produce strong muscle contraction . ES show increase brain activity hence influence formation new nerve pathway ( know neuroplasticity ) replace damage stroke . Previous study conclude six week ES muscle back forearm improve chance person recover arm function . However , intensity treatment sufficient prevent complication identify proposal , impact functional benefit significantly limit . We plan build previous research train clinical therapist operate ES device ; start ES much early stroke ; apply high intensity treatment forearm muscle ( i.e . front back forearm ) provide treatment longer period time previously carry . We evaluate feasibility incorporate ES patient self-management programme enable independent use outside routine therapist lead rehabilitation session .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Electrical Stimulation Prevent Complications Arm Post-stroke - Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study evaluate feasibility run randomise control trial test efficacy deliver early , intensive electrical stimulation ( ES ) wrist flexor wrist extensor prevent post stroke complication ( pain muscle contracture ) paretic upper limb stroke . The feasibility study involve single centre feasibility randomise control trial integrate qualitative study ( patient carer interview therapist focus discussion group ) . Participants intervention group receive electrical stimulation ( ES ) therapy . ES similar TENS machine delivers constant stimulate current 0 100 mA via two independent channel . The motor point stimulation already know . The therapist identify motor point forearm flexor ( lead flexion movement wrist finger ) extensor ( lead extensor wrist finger ) , place electrode motor point use sticky pad . They connect electrode respective channel electrical stimulator . The ES set deliver 450Î¼s pulse frequency 40-60Hz ( per patient convenience ) . The intensity current increase produce alternate contraction flexor extensor use flex-hold-extend-hold pattern . A single stimulation hold cycle last 20 second cyclically repeat 30 minute device remove . The device require study donate Verity Medical Ltd . The device CE mark used accordance manufacturer 's marketing authorisation . Band 5 therapist administer initial ES treatment mark correct electrode placement . The initial treatment take 15 20 minute assess correct motor point . This do ensuring pure flexion extension movement produce ulnar radial deviation . Once motor point mark skin ( use medical skin marker pen ) member therapy team band 3 provide subsequent treatment take 2-5 minute apply electrode pad pre-marked motor point switch device pre-stored treatment setting . The ES device provide treatment 30 minute , without need therapist remain present . It remove device complete set programme switch . Patients and/or carers show therapist apply electrode pad use device 10 minute . Patients and/or carers ask self-manage treatment upon discharge treatment continue twice day , 5 day week , total period 3 month . A patient diary include device case participant and/or nominated carer encourage record time device use . Participants control group receive electrical stimulation therapy intervention access usual service . Ten pairs patient participant nominate carers interview experience use support love one use electrical stimulation therapy part research study . The interview use examine issue regard compliance ES treatment regime , acceptability ES treatment , experience support stroke survivor use ES treatment , perceive treatment effect , train provide ongoing support need issue relate recruitment consent . The purpose interview identify issue relate deliver ES part randomise control trial . The finding interview contribute final content design research protocol definitive trial . Each interview last around one hour total take place participant ' home , clinic prefer , record , transcribe verbatim analyse thematically . Interviews conduct follow completion 3 month follow-up assessment . Five pair patient participant control group nominate carers interview examine issue perspective control group participant . Four Physiotherapists four occupational therapist Nottingham Stroke Unit invite participate minimum one maximum three focus discussion group course feasibility RCT . The focus group discuss barrier facilitator successfully implement intervention study protocol clinical practice .</detailed_description>
