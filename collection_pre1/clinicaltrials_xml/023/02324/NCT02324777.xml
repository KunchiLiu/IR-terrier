	<detailed_description>A Phase IIa randomize double blind placebo control crossover trial ( RCT ) use six different herbal cannabis drug product formulation prepare Sponsor , Prairie Plant Systems Inc. An initial screening period ( minimum one week ) complete pain assessment determination eligibility . After screen , eligible subject randomly assign receive 6 different formulation random order . The study conduct use six period 7 day duration , period consist one day exposure 6 day washout study drug . The study therefore take 6 week complete enrolled subject additional week adverse event monitor final study exposure . Total time study may therefore maximum nine week ( include screen ) . Adult subject ( age ≥50y ) recruit chronic ( &gt; 3 month ) moderate severe pain ( pain score ≥40/100 visual analogue scale ) due primary osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee define American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) criterion . Target enrolment study 36 ( 18 site ) . The study conduct Alan Edwards Pain Management Unit McGill University Health Centre , Montreal , Quebec , Canada Pain Management Unit Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada . A dedicated ventilate room available site cannabinoid inhalation study use prior evaluation trial medicinal cannabis . All subject meet eligibility criterion screen period randomize receive 6 herbal cannabis drug product formulation randomly assign order treatment Clinical Visit ( CV ) 2 CV7 . A washout period 6 day propose six different treatment period . This allow pharmacological effect dose minimize prior subsequent dosing period avoid confound . Throughout study subject remain stable ( pharmacological non-pharmacological ) treatment regimen . Throughout study , subject blind treatment receiving . Once subject randomize , investigator subject , well staff involve conduct management study blind treatment assignment . All dose via Volcano® Medic vapourizer ( licensed medical administration cannabis Canada March 2010 ; Licence No . 82405 ) nurse patient familiarize instruction manual . The study nurse prepare dose subject . After open vial drug product formulation , content transfer Volcano® Medic 's filling chamber ( sample-holder ) equip top bottom fine wire mesh retain finely grind material . The filling chamber place atop main body unit , 12.5 L , heat-resistant Medic Valve balloon affixed ( balloon house within opaque bag require ensure blind placebo generates little way visible vapour ) . Active component ( THCA CBDA decarboxylate THC CBD ) vapourized herbal material stream hot air exact , predefined temperature ( 190 °C ) . The ensue vapour capture balloon . After fill complete ( 35 second ) , mouthpiece attach balloon inhalation vapour study subject . The total content balloon inhale five minute use standardized inhalation technique . Immediately bag remove Volcano® Medic , inhalation accord follow regimen : 1 . Inhale 4 second 2 . Hold breath 6 second 3 . Exhale breathe normally 20 second 4 . Repeat inhale-hold-breathe cycle ( 30 second ) bag evacuate .</detailed_description>
