	<brief_summary>It know reflow phenomenon microvascular obstruction revascularization STEMI increase infarct size , cardiac remodeling , risk late mortality . Major mechanism microvascular obstruction distal embolization procedure . Some investigator show deferred stenting decrease degree microvascular obstruction compare immediate stenting STEMI . The aim current study compare impact immediate stent implantation versus defer stent implantation infarct size microvascular perfusion patient ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Deferred Stenting Patients With STEMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Patients enrol agree participate study sign inform consent among patient satisfied inclusion exclusion criterion . Acceptance study take concurrently situation patient admit via emergency department diagnosis STEMI inform consent primary coronary angiography intervention take . Considering emergent situation procedure , think impossible take inform consent study procedure achieve TIMI flow . Duty operator inform patient take informed consent primary coronary angiography intervention patient randomize immediate coronary stenting group defer coronary stent group , explain theoretical background defer coronary stenting . To patient , aspirin 300㎎ , clopidogrel 600㎎ administer orally heparin intravenously achieve ACT ( activate clotting time ) 200 250 second . Maximal total dose unfractionated heparin 100 unit/㎏ administer intervention . 2 . Transradial transfemoral approach determine operator 's decision . Flow infarct relate artery ( IRA ) check total occlusion , TIMI 0 , Ⅰ Ⅱ coronary angiography . 3 . Abciximab ( 0.25㎎/㎏ ) intracoronary injection perform possible patient guidewire pass culprit lesion . Additional manual thrombus aspiration balloon angioplasty perform operator achieve TIMI Ⅲ flow . When TIMI Ⅲ flow achieve procedure , patient randomize immediate stenting defer stenting group . 4 . Although stent implantation without balloon angioplasty prefer immediate stenting group , balloon angioplasty perform achieve distal flow . In deferred stenting group , second stage procedure ( stent implantation ) do 5 7 day TIMI Ⅲ flow achieve . 5 . On coronary intervention ( stent implantation ) , possible case implant Nobori Biolimus A9-eluting coronary stent ( Terumo , Tokyo , Japan ) . ( Other stent use length lesion cover Nobori stent . ) 6 . In group , abciximab continuous intravenous infusion dose 0.125 ㎍/㎏/min ( maximum dose 10 ㎍/min ) do initial procedure possible . ( Intracoronary injection intravenous infusion abciximab do unless contraindication abciximab . ) 7 . In group , subcutaneous enoxaparin ( low molecular weight heparin ) injection do twice daily 3 day procedure possible . In case stent implantation fifth seventh day within deferred coronary stenting group , enoxaparin injection extend deferred intervention . 8 . Transradial transfemoral approach possible . If procedure do transfemoral approach , sheath removal do continuous intravenous abciximal infusion 12 hour enoxaparin injection hemostasis confirm . 9 . In case residual stenosis IRA 30 % within deferred coronary stenting group , intravascular ultrasonography ( IVUS ) perform secondary procedure withdrawal stenting do upon operator 's discretion . 10 . In case multivessel disease , intervention non-IRA deferred group . Therefore , PCI IRA non-IRA do concurrently defer coronary stenting group . 11 . Patient maintain dual antiplatelet therapy aspirin 100㎎ clopidogrel 75㎎ PCI . 12 . Among prescribed drug PCI , statin agent use upon operator 's discretion . 13 . Cardiac MRI do period 30±7 day diagnose STEMI group . 14 . Follow-up period 1 month ± 1 week , 6 month ± 4 week , 12 month ± 4 week group . Transthoracic echocardiography do 6 month ± 4 week follow-up period .</detailed_description>
