	<brief_title>Evaluation Electrocardiographic Guidance Accurate Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Placement Children .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The placement peripherally inserted central catheter ( PICCs ) important component medical care variety patient . Current practice require radiographic confirmation catheter tip placement prior use line administration medication . Often final catheter tip position may uncertain base radiographic imaging . Other time , catheter malpositioned require adjustment repeat radiographic imaging . In adult patient , system confirmation base electrocardiographic activity implement FDA approve . This study enroll 192 child less 18 year age , receive electrocardiographic guidance placement PICC , addition radiography do standard care . The investigator determine location PICC tip ECG radiograph , measure degree correlation two method .</detailed_description>
