	<brief_title>Hand Ultrasonography : Clinical Functional Correlation Symptomatic Osteoarthritis ( OA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Osteoarthritis ( OA ) prevalent joint disease actually , hand OA one characteristic subtypes . The estimated prevalence 26 % 70 year woman . Treatment follow-up disease receive less attention compare case involve knee hip , probably involvement present functional limitation see large joint . For diagnosis follow-up hand OA conventional radiography use , although exam give u insight two plane articulation allow reliable approach tendon , muscle periarticular structure . The ultrasound ( US ) appear emerge technique . More sensitive technique require disease progression evaluation ) . It useful image method , capable show early late inflammation-related injury structural damage consider great test follow-up rheumatic disease patient . Safe , easy perform , low cost , fast able evaluate various site attack turn , use monitoring evaluation therapeutic response patient . Some author suggest sonographic evaluation well plain radiography , involve radiation allows joint evaluation various site . However , ultrasound still limit use hand OA compare use inflammatory joint disease . The objective study evaluate correlation / association ultrasonographic finding inflammatory synovial hypertrophy power Doppler interphalangeal joint ( IP ) clinical functional variable patient hand OA test intra interobserver reproducibility ultrasonographic finding Material method . A prospective study ultrasonography 60 patient hand OA perform . The inclusion criterion : diagnosis hand OA , accord criterion American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) involvement proximal / distal IP joint ; 40 year old ; visual analog scale pain ( VAS 0-10 cm ) joint study 3-8cm ; agree sign Consent Term study . Exclusion criterion : change use oral corticosteroid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug last thirty day ; change treatment OA last two month ( include drug rehabilitation ) ; radiography hand suggest interphalangeal arthropathy etiology ( psoriatic arthritis , microcrystalline arthropathy ) . The symptomatic joint evaluate 60 patient study . Patients evaluate six time , make , 360 assessment . Each dorsal recess ( 360 ) palmar ( 360 ) recess , account 720 joint recess end study . Patients outpatient rheumatology clinic Federal University São Paulo ( UNIFESP ) , Paulista Medical School , São Paulo , Brazil . The study approve Research Ethics Committee Institution . Evaluation Two `` blind '' observer ( clinical ultrasonography ) evaluate symptomatic IP joint first assessment follow time : T0 , T1 , T4 , T8 , T12 T48 week . At time 0 ( T0 ) evaluation demographic data collect plain radiograph hand perform anteroposterior view . Clinical Evaluation Patients evaluate six time accord follow assessment tool : visual analogue scale ( VAS ) pain rest study joint ( VASr 0-10 cm ) ; VAS joint movement ( VASm 0-10cm ) ; VAS joint swell accord evaluator ( VASs 0-10cm ) ; joint goniometry ; need analgesic ( paracetamol 750mg daily average express tablet / day ) ; handgrip strength Jamar dynamometer grip ( instruction manual , PC 5030J1- Preston / Trenton , Ontario Canada ; Mathiowetz , 1984 ) involve study joint hand ; pinch strength ( pulp-pulp , tripod key ) dynamometer Pinch Gauge ( instruction manual , A853-4-Smith &amp; Nephew / Germantown , United States America ; Mathiowetz , 1984 ) study finger ; hand function assess Brazilian version two functional questionnaire , COCHIN questionnaire AUSCAN Index . Ultrasound evaluation The ultrasonography evaluation perform clinical assessment , six time evaluation experience sonographer musculoskeletal US . The US examination carry use MyLab 60 Xvision ( Esaote , Biomedica - Genova , Italy ) use linear transducer frequency 10-18 megahertz ( MHz ) . The following ultrasonography parameter evaluate : Synovial Hypertrophy ( SH ) : Quantitative measurement synovial hypertrophy ( SH ) : This measurement make bone surface joint capsule dorsal palmar recess assessment express millimeter ( mm ) . Semiquantitative measurement SH : assess semiquantitative score range 0 3 , modify proximal IP ( PIP ) distal ( IFD ) score create Szkudlarek collaborator 2003 . According score : Grade 0 = fluid ; B , grade 1 = minimal amount fluid ; C , grade 2 = moderate amount fluid ( without distension joint capsule ) ; D , grade 3 = extensive amount fluid ( distension joint capsule ) . Scores 0 1 consider normaland pathological score 2 3 . Synovial Blood Flow : estimate presence signal power Doppler ( PD ) also grade 0-3 . Grade 0 = flow synovium ; grade 1 = single vessel signal ; grade 2 = confluent vessel signal less half area synovium ; grade 3 = vessel signal half area synovium . The pulse repetition frequency ( PRF ) maintain 500 1000 Hz The frequency vary 6.3 10 MHz . It consider normal grade 0 pathological grade 1 , 2 3 . Intraobserver interobserver reproducibility ultrasound evaluation Assessment intra- interobserver reproducibility perform quantitative semiquantitative measure SH PD . This evaluation do 25 % sample ( 90 joint recess ) . In analysis two ultrasonographers involve . The first responsible ultrasonographic evaluation entire sample . In addition , also responsible conduct second ultrasound measure use assess intraobserver reproducibility . The second ultrasonographer responsible ultrasonographic evaluation use assess inter-observer reproducibility . During evaluation first ultrasonographer image evaluate record . Such image record identified number ( patient 's name ) evaluate ultrasonographer ( first ultrasonographer ) 60 day interval . The second ultrasonographer ultrasound evaluation image record first ultrasonographer completely independently . Statistical Analysis Continuous data sample describe mean standard deviation ( SD ) . Categorical data express frequency percentage . Continuous variable sample test normality Kolmogorov-Smirnov test ; Spearman correlation use continuous variable ; Mann-Whitney test association continuous categorical variable chi-square test categorical variable . Reproducibility assessment ultrasonography measurement perform use kappa test intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) . Differences consider statistically significant p &lt; 0.05</detailed_description>
