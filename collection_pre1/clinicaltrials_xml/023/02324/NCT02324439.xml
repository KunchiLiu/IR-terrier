	<brief_title>Flaxseed Maintenance Therapy Ovarian Cancer Patients Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For year 2014 , project 21,980 woman diagnose 14,270 death ovarian cancer ( OC ) US . OC lead cause death gynecologic malignancy rank second among newly diagnose gynecological cancer United States . More 70 % patient present advanced disease ( stag II-IV ) . Although patient ( 70-80 % ) initially respond cytoreductive surgery adjuvant paclitaxel platinum-based chemotherapy , approximately 80 % woman experience disease recurrence . For stage III IV , risk recurrence high , 5-year survival rate range 13 % 44 % . Furthermore , OC represent high potential metastasis even set complete response initial therapy . Efforts devise new treatment strategy therefore essential order improve survival . In grant application , investigator postulate utilizing dietary supplementation flaxseed maintenance therapy patient OC clinical remission follow treatment platinum-based regimen tolerable prolong progression-free survival ( PFS ) . The investigator hypothesis base following : - Data investigator laboratory reveal flaxseed effectively decrease severity progression OC spontaneous preclinical egg-laying hen model fully recapitulate human OC . - In phase II study , flaxseed supplementation reduce proliferation rate prostate cancer 30 day . - Flaxseed show inhibit solid tumor growth metastases several preclinical cancer model ( breast , prostate , colon ) . - Flaxseed safe dietary supplement cancer patient . - Flaxseed supplementation increase survival investigator ' animal model flaxseed-fed hen exhibit low inflammatory marker maintain healthy weight , infer good quality life ( QOL ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients diagnosis OC include epithelial ovarian carcinoma , primary peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer currently clinical remission determine PI coI within 4 month completion cancer treatment . Patients risk clinical relapse : patient stage remission undergone surgical debulking adjuvant chemotherapy . Patients must adequate : Bone marrow function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1,500/mcl , equivalent Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTCAE v4.0 ) Grade 1 . Platelets great equal 100,000/mcl ( CTCAE v4.0 Grade 01 ) . Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) great equal 9.0g/dl ( CTCAE v4.0 Grade 2 ) . Renal function : Creatinine le equal 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) , CTCAE v4.0 Grade 1 . Hepatic function : Bilirubin le equal 1.5 x ULN ( CTCAE v4.0 Grade 1 ) . Serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase ( SGOT ) alkaline phosphatase â‰¤ 2.5 x ULN ( CTCAE v4.0 Grade 1 ) . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test . Patients history invasive malignancy , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer , exclude evidence malignancy present within last five year . Patients also exclude previous cancer treatment contraindicate protocol therapy . Patients ovarian cancer low malignant potential ( borderline cancer ) . Patients receive prior radiotherapy chemotherapy another malignancy . Patients pregnant lactate . Patients serious medical psychiatric illness . Patients history inflammatory bowel disease , problem chronic diarrhea history bowel obstruction . Patient receive investigational drug within 28 day enrollment . Patients concurrent uncontrolled illness . Patients unable tolerate and/or allergy flaxseed flaxseed preparation . Patients Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) performance status &gt; 2 . Patients history uncontrolled diabetes ( flaxseed low blood glucose level might additive effect use antidiabetic drug ) . Patients concurrently use anticoagulants/antiplatelets DAILY BASIS , include aspirin , Clopidogrel ( Plavix ) , Ticlopidine ( Ticlid ) , Coumadin . Patients diagnosis of/problems von Willebrand 's disease bleeding disorder ( flaxseed may slow blood clotting ; risk bruise bleed people anticoagulant bleed disorder may concern ) . Flaxseed supplementation may contraindicate patient acute abdomen , esophageal stricture perforation , dysphagia , GI obstruction ileus , acute intestinal inflammation unexplained abdominal pain . Patients condition exclude trial high fiber content flaxseed may make condition bad</criteria>
