	<detailed_description>Bladder cancer fifth common cancer United States . This single center Phase I safety efficacy study MK-3475 therapy use combination bladder infuse BCG treatment . The study determine safety administer MK-3475 fix dose every three week conjunction intravesicular BCG treatment non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patient recurrence two course induction ( 6 dos ) intravesical therapy ( two BCG course , one BCG course one approve intravesical therapy ) administer within 12 month , one induction ( 6 dos ) one maintenance ( 3 dos ) intrevesical therapy ( BCG ) . Subjects confirmation bladder cancer non-invasive muscle . Approximately 20 subject screen treat 15 eligible subject high risk superficial bladder cancer transurethral resection bladder tumor . The rationale use indicate dose TICE® BCG base upon FDA approve commercially provide package insert/ instruction use product . BCG installation use treat non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer 30 year . It one successful biotherapies cancer use . Despite long clinical experience BCG , mechanism therapeutic effect still investigation . The first 3 subject treat dose 100 mg MK-3475 ensure safety combination . If safety efficacy issue present , dose escalate 200 mg MK-3475 every 3 week .</detailed_description>
