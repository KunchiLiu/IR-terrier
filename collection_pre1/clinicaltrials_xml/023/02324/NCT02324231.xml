	<brief_summary>In multi-center open-label cluster-randomized control parallel-group multiple crossover non-inferiority trial child adolescents 20 year diagnose cancer require chemotherapy , primarily safety , secondarily efficacy endpoint , high ( 39.0°C ) versus low ( 38.5°C ) temperature limit define fever ( TLDF ) diagnosis fever chemotherapy-induced neutropenia ( FN ) study . Safety assess rate safety relevant event per chemotherapy exposure time , composite endpoint include serious medical complication bacteremia FN . Patients repeatedly randomize ( cluster : study site ) high low TLDF every month , result possible multiple crossover one patient . The high TLDF declare inferior regard safety compare low TLDF non-inferiority rate ratio safety relevant event proven , single-sided non-inferiority margin 1.33 , apply mixed Poisson regression .</brief_summary>
