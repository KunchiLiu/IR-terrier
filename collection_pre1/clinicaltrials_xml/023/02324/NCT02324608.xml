	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study side effect well cetuximab surgery work treat patient skin cancer form , grows , spread quickly spread start nearby tissue lymph node . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Giving cetuximab surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab Before Surgery Treating Patients With Aggressive Locally Advanced Skin Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate cetuximab Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion patient advance squamous cell carcinoma skin ( SCCS ) . II . To assess whether neoadjuvant cetuximab give patient population safe feasible . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure progression free overall survival patient advance SCCS receive neoadjuvant cetuximab . II . To determine conversion resectability patient treat neoadjuvant cetuximab capture change reconstructive option render possible neoadjuvant treatment . III . Analyze relationship know deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) mutation tumor per FoundationOneTM genomic profile , correlate clinical endpoint clinical benefit conversion resectability discover potential marker response and/or resistance . IV . Measure downstream activation signal pathway without know driver , include epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) pathway . V. Determine tumor shrinkage cetuximab associate increased apoptosis evidence activated caspase-3 , pre- post- treatment tumor tissue . VI . Determine whether cetuximab result increase antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) post- , compare pre-treatment tumor tissue . OUTLINE : Patients receive cetuximab intravenously ( IV ) 60-120 minute weekly 8 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
