	<detailed_description>If find eligible take part study agree , total 3 MBI scan : start already schedule chemotherapy treatment , 2 cycle chemotherapy , complete chemotherapy treatment surgery . You also receive standard care scan . Before MBI scan , receive injection Tc99m sestamibi ( type drug give energy see special camera , like MBI scan , create image breast ) . You MBI scan 5 minute receive Tc99m sestamibi . During scan , breast position 2 detector lightly compress . The detector 2 square camera , look similar mammography camera . The scan take 40 minute . Information , image previous scan medical history , also collect medical record . The result MBI scan affect change treatment , include type surgery may . Length Study : Your active participation study last MBI scan complete . This investigational study . MBI scan study perform use FDA-approved commercially available method . Tc99m sestamibi FDA-approved commercially available . The use MBI scan measure much cancer breast chemotherapy consider investigational . Up 65 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
