	<brief_title>Phase II Study Pazopanib Second-line Treatment After Sunitinib mRCC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary end point progression-free survival ( PFS ) . Secondary end point overall survival ( OS ) , objective response rate ( ORR ) safety . We assess tumor response accord RECIST 1.1 . Efficacy evaluate computed tomography contrast chest , abdomen , pelvis . We perform tumor assessment use image study baseline every six week end treatment . We also use assessment confirm response ( least 4 week initial documentation ) whenever disease progression suspect . All imaging scan evaluate independent imaging-review committee ( IRC ) blind study treatment . Patients inadequate data study assessment regard nonevaluable . Adverse event grade accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 3.0 . Safety assess physical examination laboratory test . Electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) perform baseline every six week end treatment .</detailed_description>
