	<brief_title>Using Behaviour Change Messaging Improve Communal Toilets Dhaka , Bangladesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis test : A behavior change communication intervention improve quality cleanliness sanitation service available low-income resident Dhaka . Specific Objectives : 1 . To deliver communication message ( select promise change target behavior influence quality cleanliness share sanitation facility ) randomly select low-income community Dhaka . 2 . To evaluate effectiveness behavior change communication intervention design change target behavior related quality cleanliness share sanitation facility . Background The investigator contend important barrier improve sanitation low-income community Dhaka include : 1 ) Low-income community resident lack financial resource purchase good option . 2 ) The cost land Dhaka , increase 600 fold since 1970s ( Hossain , 2011 ) , make space toilet expensive 3 ) A public sector characterize weak institution lack funding management capacity implement maintain effective sanitary infrastructure ( Hossain , 2011 ) 4 ) pervasive informal local political system maximize financial interest politically connect elites communal interest low-income community resident ( Hackenbroch Hossain , 2012 , Hossain , 2011 ) . More one third Dhaka resident live informal settlement government authority accept responsibility provide urban utility include water sanitation service ( World Bank , 2007 ) . A central motivation politician avoid formalize settlement informality keep resident constant state dependency local party associate , state local elite use extract continuous stream resource ( Anjaria , 2006 , Hossain , 2011 ) . Behavior change communication message directly resolve major barrier improve community sanitation low-income community Dhaka . Simple general message , encourage people clean keep sanitary facility clean reduce risk disease transmission , unlikely effective address determinant poor availability , cleanliness maintenance share sanitary facility . By contrast , develop behavior change message inform experience perspective target population study identify opportunities new information new social norm could alter key behavior . The pilot work find considerable interest cleaner well maintain latrine . Inclusion 2 low-cost hardware accessory , waste bin material condoms sanitary pad discard way block toilet bucket assist rinse toilet defecation make easy community follow behavior change recommendation support cleaner share latrine.The central question research project : Can strategically design behavior change campaign supplement low-cost hardware accessory shift current equilibrium unhygienic share sanitation facility towards clean facility low-income community Dhaka ? Research Design Methods : SUMMARY : - Deliver behavior change communication message use behavior change communication intervention randomly select low-income community Dhaka . ( Package behavior change intervention target behavior : waste disposal , rule latrine use repair maintenance ) - Evaluate effectiveness behavior change communication intervention change target behavior . DETAILS : Deliver message use behavior change communication intervention randomly select low-income community Dhaka . The study team add intervention component onto exist NGO intervention increase impact decrease cost . Thus , extensive pilot informative work , investigator develop behavior change communication material , base specific behavior target improve latrine cleanliness quality . The material message use train community health promoter ( CHPs ) currently work select NGOs . Some material include sign board latrine fix area randomly select receive intervention . The intervention also include enable hardware , waste bin trash collection bucket carry water flush latrine . The intervention : delivered partner NGO community hygiene promoter . This intervention approach aim leverage exist intervention delivery partner thus add value across sector . The investigator identify NGO partner large urban program include sanitation activity Mirpur , Mohakhali Mohammadpur . The survey team work partner NGOs identify coverage area eligible participation study . These include : 1 . Some large slum 60 180 communal toilet sanitation intervention provide 3 12 community health promoter whose activity collectively cover entire slum area . 2 . Some small slum 6-10 communal toilet available around 150 300 household . These communal toilet situate close one another , type slum serve single community health promoter . 3 . Some scatter slum small compare slum . This type slum consist 15-50 household share one communal toilet . One community health promoter cover 4-8 scattered slum . The team divide select slum distinct cluster primarily base community health promoter coverage area . If area large , CHP coverage area sub-divided use geographic boundary road , bazaar , water body clearly distinguish distinct cluster . Each cluster comprise : 1. area cover single CHP 2. 1 30 communal toilet A communal toilet consist structure approximately 2 16 chamber drain common septic tank . The cluster unit randomization study . At begin study , study team conduct communal toilet list collect information number toilet user communal toilet . Once list do , statistician independent project randomly assign cluster either intervention comparison arm . Clusters separate geographically street , bazaar , field , drainage settlement , therefore investigator expect intervention message activity spill control toilet cluster even locate close . For intervention cluster , field also enroll match control cluster , match number toilet chamber per cluster . Investigators use follow category match : &lt; 5 chamber , 5-10 chamber , 11-15 chamber , 16-20 chamber , &gt; 20 chamber assume base number chamber , number user could vary . A statistician , resident Bangladesh member study project , randomly assign cluster intervention versus control . WSUP , behalf intervention team , sign contract partner NGOs implement behavior change package . The behavior change message enable hardware deliver partner NGOs community health promoter ( CHPs ) . Investigators help partner NGOs train CHPs component intervention ensure CHPs conduct group meeting inter-personal communication effectively convey intervention message . The partner NGO receive final behavior change communication material study team responsible print distribute material intervention community . The research team involve implementation team ensure rollout occurs specify intervention cluster plan frequency time message control cluster . Investigators explain plan fidelity assessment implementers share result soon available . â€¢ Evaluate effectiveness behavior change communication intervention change target behavior . Behavior change campaign provoke discussion viewer campaign social network likely result behavior change ( Boulay et al. , 2002 , Hafstad Aaro , 1997 ) . The survey instrument include objective uptake indicator , measurement exposure intervention , awareness behavior change package , frequency discussion content behavior change communication information respondent 's social network , access sanitation facility attitude regard acceptability cleanliness facility . Investigators conduct pre-intervention baseline survey draw systematic random sample one adult user per communal toilet intervention control cluster . The field team sample equal number user intervention control arm . The field team visit communal toilet enroll third household near communal toilet administer toilet user survey one adult resident . If select user n't want participate survey , field team approach subsequent household enrollment also record non-response . The field team administer toilet quality/cleanliness observation instrument ass primary objective indicator study toilet . To ensure inter-rater reliability toilet observation among observer , subset communal toilet evaluate two separate observer . Observer pair conduct assessment 5-10 minute interval , independent evaluation compare make sure observer measure cleanliness consistently objectively . Such research reliability observation conduct initial 50 communal toilet , observer credibility effectively establish discrepancy minimize . Along quantitative survey , field investigator also explore local elite landlord 's view role roles others construct , maintain , clean empty communal toilet facility conduct qualitative interview previously mention three type slum . Field investigator conduct in-depth interview 4 different landlord elite mention type slum interview reach data saturation . Field investigator interview elites landlord intervention commences end intervention . The study team conduct baseline evaluation intervention control communities well endline 6 month intervention roll . In addition , two month initiation intervention , field team conduct rapid fidelity assessment use survey instrument random subset 50 intervention toilet . The purpose rapid assessment ensure behavior change intervention exposure occur expect level . If , partner NGOs contact problem address . The study team compare change target behavior observe intervention community compare change observe control community measure amount behavior change attributable intervention .</detailed_description>
