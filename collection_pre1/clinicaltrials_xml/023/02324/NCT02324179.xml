	<brief_summary>Our objective determine whether HIV infect youth high level endothelial dysfunction , measure Peripheral Arterial Tonometry , compare age match healthy control . The investigator also aim gather preliminary data whether endothelial Peripheral Arterial Tonometry ( endoPAT ) measurements endothelial dysfunction independently associate HIV antiretroviral factor , marker inflammation traditional cardiovascular disease risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objectives Hypothesis Our objective determine whether HIV infect youth high level endothelial dysfunction , measure Peripheral Arterial Tonometry , compare age match healthy control . We also aim gather preliminary data whether endoPAT measurement endothelial dysfunction independently associate HIV antiretroviral factor , marker inflammation traditional cardiovascular disease risk . Specific Aim 1 : To compare endothelial function , measure endoPAT , HIV-infected youth match healthy control . Hypothesis : HIV infect youth impair endothelial function compare age match healthy control . Specific Aim 2 : To determine risk factor endothelial dysfunction evaluating : 1 ) risk factor specific HIV disease stage , cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) count , HIV viral load , specific ART regimen , perinatally acquire versus behaviorally acquire infection ; 2 ) marker cardiovascular disease risk smoking , lipid level , insulin resistance ; 3 ) marker inflammation immune activation Hypothesis : Endothelial dysfunction correlate advance HIV disease stage , use protease inhibitor worse traditional cardiovascular disease risk factor include lipid , insulin resistance , smoking . Specific Aim 3 : To assess whether endothelial function change period 24 week HIV infect youths control . Hypothesis : Endothelial dysfunction progress time HIV-infected child healthy control . Study Design This 24-week observational cohort study gather preliminary data prevalence risk factor endothelial dysfunction HIV-infected youth . Children enrol age 8 30 year either congenitally behaviorally infected HIV , continuous ART least 6 month HIV-1 RNA &lt; 1,000 copies/mL . We also enroll age- gender-matched group healthy control . A total 50 HIV-infected children/young adult 50 match control enrol . Evaluations perform two time point : baseline week 24 . At visit , evaluation similar . We collect demographic data medical history include date birth , sex , gender , CD4 cell count nadir , past current ART non-ART medication history , HIV stage base CDC guideline , HIV diagnosis date method HIV acquisition , alcohol , smoke drug habit , well family history cardiovascular disease diabetes . We record clinical measurement include blood pressure , physical examination abnormality , waist hip circumference tanner stage . Subjects undergo laboratory measurement lipids level marker insulin resistance fasting state ( &gt; 8 hr fast except water medication ) , well inflammation immune activation marker ( hsCRP , Interleukin 6 IL-6 , sCD14 ) . HIV RNA CD4 cell count collect clinical record . Plasma serum store possible future measurement inflammation cardiovascular marker . We perform endothelial function measurement PAT recommend manufacturer . Controls recruit community use Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) -approved flyer , uninfected sibling relatives HIV-infected patient , physician referral .</detailed_description>
