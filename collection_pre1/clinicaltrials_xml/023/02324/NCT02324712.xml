	<brief_summary>Purpose : 1 ) To investigate difference pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory cytokine growth factor circulate blood ( cytokine level saliva ) patient chronic temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) acupuncture ; 2 ) To determine difference cytokine profile real sham acupuncture circulate blood patient chronic TMD ; 3 ) To explore correlation change clinical outcome . Participants : Patients chronic TMD pain recruit University North Carolina-Chapel Hill ( UNC-CH ) Orofacial Pain Clinic . Procedures ( method ) : Participants complete self-administered questionnaire assess TMD-related comorbidity . During initial visit , study examiner record clinical characteristic muscle joint head , neck body accord newly recommend diagnostic criterion ( DC ) TMD . Clinical outcome include pain index ( compute numeric rating scale ) masseter , temporalis supplemental painful muscle , patient-reported symptom ( use Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile ; MYMOP ) pain intensity ( use Pain Scale ) . Blood ( 5 cc ) take acupuncture treatment . Participants self-collect pre-treatment post-treatment saliva sample . Patients receive 4 acupuncture treatment , per week 4 week . The primary outcome measure change IL-8 level circulate blood saliva 4 week real acupuncture compare sham acupuncture . Secondary outcome measure include compare change level nerve growth factor ( NGF ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFα ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , IL-1α , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-6 IL-10 , real acupuncture Week 1 compare sham acupuncture real acupuncture Week 4 compare sham acupuncture . The exploratory outcome measure correlation change cytokine level clinical variable 4 week real acupuncture compare 4 week sham acupuncture .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cytokine Growth Factor Changes Correlation With Clinical Outcomes Following Acupuncture TMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) know second frequent musculoskeletal pain condition follow low back pain . According NIDCR , TMD affect 5 % -12 % population annual cost estimate 4 billion dollar US . Recent study investigate acupuncture treatment musculoskeletal pain report various result . Several meta-analyses systematic review randomize controlled trial suggest acupuncture treatment improve TMD-related pain . Its mechanism action improve TMD pain , however , largely unclear . Elevated level pro-inflammatory cytokine , e.g. , MCP-1 IL-8 find circulate blood patient TMD . Upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine level correlate great sensitivity pain evoke stimulus . Abnormalities level pro-inflammatory cytokine often accompany alteration level anti-inflammatory cytokine , e.g. , IL-1ra , associate reduction pain inflammation . The effect acupuncture pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine , growth factor , clinical pain function report prospective cohort TMD patient multiple time point clinical setting . The propose mechanistic study seek ascertain acupuncture compare sham acupuncture produce measurable change circulate pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine growth factor manner associated patient self-reports pain function 4-week treatment period . Cytokine growth factor level measure blood saliva ; saliva used measure cytokine level .</detailed_description>
