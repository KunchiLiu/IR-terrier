	<brief_summary>Using establish model human typhoid infection , whereby healthy adult deliberately expose typhoid-causing bacteria , investigator determine effective new typhoid conjugate vaccine ( Vi-TCV ) prevent infection . The new typhoid vaccine compare control vaccine ( meningococcal ACWY ) . The protective effect currently use typhoid polysaccharide vaccine ( Vi-PS ) also study compare control vaccine use model typhoid infection . A second component study involve vaccinate 15-20 participant Vi-PS . Serum obtain prior vaccination 4-6 week vaccination . The post-vaccination serum pool used create anti-Vi IgG serum standard .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Typhoid fever infection cause bacterium , Salmonella Typhi , cause disease human . It transmit faecal-orally cause 22 million infection every year develop country , area Asia , Africa South America , access clean drinking water sanitation facility limit . Although typhoid fever treatable effective antibiotic , 200,000 death every year resource-limited region . Salmonella Typhi could eradicate improve sanitation live condition endemic region difficult . Vaccination prevent transmission Salmonella Typhi could significantly reduce burden disease . The currently license typhoid vaccine moderately effective prevent infection people immunised vaccine license use young child . Novel typhoid vaccine develop overcome problem , research information need study well vaccine work routinely use . This study propose investigate protective effect novel typhoid vaccine ( typhoid Vi polysaccharide capsule - tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine ) use human challenge model typhoid infection . Healthy adult vaccinate novel typhoid vaccine , currently use typhoid vaccine ( Vi polysaccharide capsule vaccine ) control vaccine . One month vaccination , participant expose live Salmonella Typhi drink solution contain bacteria . Participants closely monitor determine participant develop infection protect . In addition assess protective effect conjugate unconjugated typhoid vaccine , effect vaccine immune system clinical course typhoid infection also study . It hop knowledge gain study contribute use vaccine Salmonella Typhi help control preventable disease .</detailed_description>
