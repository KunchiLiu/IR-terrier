	<brief_summary>Investigators aim assess sensitivity specificity transcranial doppler determine intracranial hypertension patient admit intensive care unit brain injury need Intracranial Pressure ( ICP ) monitoring ( accord international guideline ) . Non invasive ICP measurement use transcranial doppler carry standard invasive ICP monitoring placement ; head compute tomography ( CT ) scan also perform intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Invasive Versus Non Invasive Measurement Intracranial Pressure Brain Injury Trial ( IMPRESSIT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As part intensive treatment brain injury , intracranial pressure ( ICP ) control cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) fall 60-70 millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) ( depend cause injury ) and/or ICP great 20 mmHg . Intracranial hypertension ( ICHP ) occur approximately 40 % patient severe traumatic brain injury infrequent patient non traumatic brain injury , subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) , spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ( SICH ) , ischemic stroke ( IS ) , presence ICHP inadequate CPP correlate poor outcome . Therefore , measure monitor ICP CPP institute soon possible patient severe brain injury . Currently , available method ICP monitor include epidural , subdural , subarachnoid , parenchymal , ventricular location . Historically , ventricular ICP catheter use reference standard prefer technique possible . It accurate , reliable method monitoring ICP . Subarachnoid , subdural , epidural monitor less accurate . Unfortunately , describe method invasive , associated complication rate inexpensive . For reason , new method develop order measure ICP non invasively . One use Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) : use low-frequency-pulsed Doppler 2 Mega Hertz ( MHz ) acoustic window regions—where skull bone thin—or foramen magnum , possible measure flow velocity basal cerebral artery . Many formula describe correlate Flow Velocities ICP : study , use method introduce test Schmidt et Al . 2000 . Those author observe relationship among mean arterial blood pressure ( ABP ) diastolic flow velocity ( FVd ) mean flow velocity ( FVm ) middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) lead find formula able yield CPP ( estimate CPP : ABP x FVd / FVm + 14 ) ; CPP estimate , ICPtcd easily calculate ( ICP= ABP- CPP ) . The first aim study evaluate sensitivity specificity ICPtcd , compare invasive ICP measurement , order exclude elevate ICP patient acute brain injury epidural hematoma ( EDH ) , subdural hematoma ( SDH ) , subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) , intraparenchymal hemorrhage ( IPH ) , ischaemic stroke ( IS ) , traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) ; secondary outcome correlation ICPtcd ischemia brain CT scan Glasgow outcome scale ( GOS ) discharge three month . Inclusion criterion : acute brain injury , patient require invasive ICP monitoring Age &gt; 18 yr ; exclusion criterion : inaccessible ultrasound window patient receive craniotomy ICP probe placement . The sample size 250 patient . All patient include evaluation non-invasive ICP monitoring use TCD ( ICPtcd ) , least three TCD Measurements perform correlate non-invasive ICP . The timing TCD measurement correlation follow : - 1° measurement : perform , close possible , ICP monitor probe placement . - 2° measurement . Immediately follow ICP monitor probe placement ; - 3° measurement : ICP management optimization . A CT scan must perform first measurement third one . All patient receive standard clinical treatment accord international guideline treatment various type brain injury .</detailed_description>
