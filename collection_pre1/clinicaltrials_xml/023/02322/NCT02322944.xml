	<brief_summary>This study aim develop quality improvement strategy relevant tool focus reperfusion therapy patient STEMI , evaluate effectiveness via hospital-level cluster randomize clinical trial , base nationally representative collaborative network 100 hospital establish China PEACE retrospective study . In baseline survey period , consecutively recruit eligible inpatient collect relevant medical information , performance participate hospital implementation intervention assess . During follow intervention period , 6-10 hospital show strong willingness ability collaborate select `` process optimization group '' . Their clinical pathway team build re-organized purpose quality improvement , develop individualized treatment strategy process . Meanwhile , participate hospital divide intervention control group 1:1 ratio , intervention group take treatment improvement strategy implementation , control group maintain routine practice pattern . All hospital consecutively recruit qualified patient method adopt baseline period . Then reperfusion rate performance measure compare among different group ( process optimization , intervention control ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim develop quality improvement strategy relevant tool focus reperfusion therapy patient STEMI , evaluate effectiveness via hospital-level cluster randomize clinical trial , base nationally representative collaborative network 100 hospital establish China PEACE retrospective study . The primary outcome measure reperfusion rate among eligible patient STEMI , secondary one include timeliness primary PCI ( D2B ) fibrinolytic therapy ( D2N ) . assessment base consecutively recruit eligible inpatient , well collect relevant medical information via case report form finish local doctor central medical record abstraction . During first study period , baseline performance 100 participate hospital implementation intervention assess . During follow period , 3-5 PCI-capable 3-5 non-PCI capable hospital show strong willingness ability collaborate select `` process optimization group '' . Their clinical pathway team build re-organized purpose quality improvement , develop individualized treatment strategy process , include examine local hospital ' workflow determine key link affect rate reperfusion therapy timeliness ( pre-paid policy fibrinolytic PPCI , thrombolytic drug preparation , cardiac catheterization laboratory preparation , transfer ER Cath lab , interventional medical team gathering , etc. ) . Also , QI strategies tool develop current study provide hospital , include train standardized treatment pattern ; build quality management team determine improvement goal ; periodical quality feedback report regular quality meeting ; tool like wristband order remind medical staff involve treatment process , workflow poster card , CRF include flowchart inform management step , study website serve communication platform . Meanwhile , participate hospital divide intervention control group 1:1 ratio use minimization allocation , intervention group take QI strategy tool develop current study mention , control group maintain routine practice pattern . Then outcome measure performance indicator compare among different group ( process optimization , intervention control ) .</detailed_description>
