	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : The primary purpose study test efficacy Emotion Regulation Therapy ( ERT ) informal caregiver ( ICs ) cancer patient . ERT manualized treatment ICs consist 8 weekly session . AIMS AND HYPOTHESES : Aim 1 : Descriptive group comparison . The nature Danish IC population 's physical psychological complaint explore number between-group comparison ICs match non-caregiving control group . The investigator hypothesize compare matched control group , ICs report 1 ) high level psychological distress maladaptive emotion regulation , 2 ) poor sleep quality , overall poorer quality life , 3 ) increase healthcare utilization . Aim 2 : Intervention mediation effect . In RCT , investigator investigate efficacy 8 session ERT ICs psychological physical distress number health outcome ICs cancer patient . Outcomes ERT group compare outcome group ICs patient receive usual medical care ( UMC ) ( see Figure 1 ) . ICs receive ERT compare ICs receive UMC expect exhibit 1a ) significant reduction psychological distress perceive caregiving burden , 1b ) improvement quality life ; 1c ) improvement pro-inflammatory marker stress/immune function reduction healthcare usage .

Based healthcare cost-effectiveness analysis RCT , ERT expect increase overall health , also reduce cost associate healthcare utilization primary secondary healthcare sector . PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURES : ICs cancer patient various cancer type consecutively recruit Aarhus University Hospital , Denmark . Staff Outpatient Clinic Department Oncology , Aarhus University Hospital , Denmark , screen ICs department . Initially investigator want include caregiver patient lung colorectal cancer . However , order able include caregiver faster pace , decide - one month two caregiver include - broaden patient group . After give informed consent , participant randomize Emotion Regulation Therapy ( ERT ) usual medical care ( UMC ) ratio 1:1 mean computer-generated randomization list . Outcome measure obtain pre- , mid- , post-therapy well 3 6-month follow-up . At every ERT session , ICs clinicians fill number self-report process measure . Cancer patient assess pre- post ERT , 3 6-months follow-up . Every IC patient provide blood sample intervention well follow-up .</detailed_description>
