	<brief_summary>Background : - Some allogeneic stem cell transplant recipient get acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . They always get steroid first treatment , may work . Those people steroids enough may benefit treatment call extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) . ECP expose white blood cell ultraviolet light outside body . Researchers want study certain marker blood predict severity outcome acute GVHD ECP treatment work people acute GVHD . They also study marker blood may help predict get ECP effect immune system . &lt; TAB &gt; Objectives : - To learn treatment acute GVHD allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Eligibility : - Adults acute GVHD enrol NCI allogeneic transplantation protocol . Design : - Transplant physician confirm participant eligibility . - Participants receive treatment steroid acute GVHD prescribe transplant physician . This continue enrol study . - If steroid work treat acute GVHD , every 28 day 6 month , participant : - physical exam . - blood test . - If steroid work , participant get additional treatment prescribe transplant physician may choose use ECP part additional treatment.. For ECP , blood remove intravenous ( IV ) catheter . A machine separate white blood cell blood part . Those cell treat methoxsalen exposed ultraviolet light . Then return participant IV . - Participants get ECP least 6 month : - vein research . They may catheter place large vein chest groin . - multiple blood test . - multiple pregnancy test ( need ) . - multiple ECP procedure . - At end ECP treatment 6 month ECP , participant additional physical exam blood test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Acute graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) remain difficult manage complication allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation cause significant morbidity mortality . - Biomarkers recently describe acute GVHD potential well predict onset , severity , steroid failure , non-relapse mortality . - First line treatment acute GVHD high dose corticosteroid fail approximately 30 % patient associate significant steroid related complication . - No second line treatment acute GVHD failure steroid establish standard approach . - Choice second line therapy acute GVHD currently base primarily physician familiarity , exist toxicity , patient 's ability tolerate new potential toxicity . - Extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) attractive therapy combine therapy steroid refractory disease due unique mechanism action involve immunomodulation well extremely low rate report side effect complication . - Biomarkers may also prove useful predict success failure specific treatment steroid refractory disease , include combine ECP . - This study allow collection biomarker data patient undergo allogeneic transplantation NCI protocol , include develop acute GVHD investigate role predict outcome initial corticosteroid therapy well currently use treatment management patient steroid refractory acute GVHD without addition ECP . Objective : -To study biomarkers patient undergo allogeneic transplantation , acute GVHD include ability predict steroid refractoriness predict outcome investigator choose second line therapy without Extracorporeal Photopheresis ( ECP ) . Eligibility : - Adult patient NCI allogeneic transplantation protocol . Design : - Non-randomized , single institution study . - Research blood biomarkers collect patient enrol . - ECP offer addition investigator chosen treatment patient develop steroid refractory acute GVHD . - The study enroll total 450 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age great equal to18 year . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Subject must also enrol NCI allogeneic transplant protocol . Patients must agree practice effective contraception ( male female subject , risk conception exists ) The effect ECP develop human fetus unknown . For reason well Methoxsalen use trial class agent know teratogenic , men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation , 4 month completion study treatment . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any physical mental condition , opinion PI , would cause risk/benefit ratio participation unacceptable . Inclusion ECP treatment patient contraindicate follow : Unstable hemodynamics require vasopressor support measure amenable medically appropriate continuation procedure . Uncontrolled infection . Inability maintain acceptable venous access . Uncontrolled uncorrectable coagulopathy . Pregnant woman exclude ECP methoxsalen , agent utilized study procedure , may cause fetal harm . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother methoxsalen , breastfeed discontinue mother treated methoxsalen . Pregnancy evaluate prior initiation ECP . History allergic idiosyncratic/hypersensitivity reaction 8 methoxypsoralen/psoralen compound . History lightsensitive cutaneous disease Subjects aphakia</criteria>
