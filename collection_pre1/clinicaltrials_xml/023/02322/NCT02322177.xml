	<brief_summary>Background : - People inborn error metabolism turn food energy right way . This affect person growth health . Researchers want know condition affect pregnant woman baby . Objectives : - To collect data medical record woman inborn error metabolism . Also , create pregnancy registry inborn error metabolism . Eligibility : - Women inborn error metabolism either : - pregnant past , - currently pregnant , - recently talk doctor become pregnant . Design : - This study collect data . No extra test do . - Participants study length pregnancy 1 year delivery . - Participants answer question family health . - The participant doctor send medical record researcher . These may include data : - Last health care visit pregnancy - Blood , urine , ultrasound , lab result pregnancy - Delivery recovery delivery - Researchers ask test ( ) use confirm pregnancy . - After participant baby , researcher ask data baby . This may include baby sit , walk , talk , etc . - The data place database . The database include participant name identify data .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maternal Inborn Errors Metabolism Pregnancy : A Pregnancy Registry Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women inherit metabolic disorder reach child bearing age often due advance early diagnosis improve pediatric care . For many disorder , little information literature guide counsel treatment patient pregnancy . The information effect underlie inborn error metabolism pregnancy derive study phenylketonuria ( PKU ) . From knowledge gain collection information multiple case pregnancy affect PKU , important management issue identify . For example , child bear mother unrestricted diet substantially likely intellectual disability , microcephaly , low birth weight woman maintain phenylalanine restrict diet . The excess phenylalanine pose long-term health risk develop fetus vigilant metabolic approach recognize mandatory woman PKU desire pregnancy . Compared PKU , intermediary metabolic disorder understudy . For example , nine publish case methylmalonic academia ( MMA ) pregnancy one case cobalamin C deficiency pregnancy , review article report case . For inborn error metabolism even less publish know . The paucity publication pregnancy IEMs PKU may due lack organize research address pregnancy management metabolic disorder . The objective study establish pregnancy registry woman inborn error metabolism PKU . We collect management plan , baseline laboratory value , prenatal postpartum course include metabolic obstetrical issue , fetal/neonatal outcomes . This study also investigate reproductive issue include infertility use artificial reproductive technology . A registry type allow physician patient report vary management outcome , positive negative , broad goal delineate optimal maternal fetal outcome unique patient population . Our registry data would also serve vehicle disseminate management experience provider , recognize individual center may sufficient experience make accurate management decision .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients clinically diagnose methylmalonic acidemia another inborn error metabolism eligible participate ; mutational enzymatic status prefer require . Biochemical testing require . Women inborn error metabolism clinically document prior pregnancy , currently pregnant plan pregnancy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients phenylketonuria hyperphenylalaninemia . Anyone unwilling provide inform consent ( adult , behalf child minor ) assent . Medical condition ( ) mental retardation reason exclusion judgment refer physician would involve minimal risk . We make every effort explain study purpose assent manner family feel age developmentally appropriate individual . We review clinical description refer physician potential research subject determine subject appropriate enter study . We reserve right exclude case definitively diagnose metabolite and/or molecular genetics related direct research interest . We expect rare minority .</criteria>
