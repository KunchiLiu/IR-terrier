	<detailed_description>According European Society Cardiology prevalence Heart Failure ( HF ) 2 3 % general population increase age , prevalence 70- 80-years-old people 10 20 % . HF cause 5 % acute hospital admission , present 10 % patient hospital bed , account high national expenditure health , mostly due cost hospital admission . Although patient live many year great improvement medical therapy last decade , overall 50 % patient dead 4 year . Despite different hypothesis explain underlying physiopathology heart failure propose time , single paradigm heart failure establish definitively . One logical explanation inability define syndrome heart failure precise mechanistic model clinical syndrome heart failure almost certainly represent summation multiple anatomic , functional , biological alteration interact together complex way . Thus , surprising investigator use variety complex model attempt describe syndrome heart failure . Nowadays , accept hypothesis explain HF physiopathology progression `` neurohormonal model '' . According paradigm , heart failure progress result overexpression biologically active molecule exert toxic effect heart circulation . A variety molecules include norepinephrine , angiotensin II , endothelin , aldosterone , tumor necrosis factor implicate factor contribute disease progression fail heart . Despite effectiveness neurohormonal model explain disease progression many insight provide development new therapy , increase clinical evidence suggest current model fail completely explain disease progression . Thus , neurohormonal model may necessary sufficient explain aspect disease progression fail heart . Because prognosis HF patient still unsatisfactory despite optimal therapy , mechanism contribute HF progression need elucidate . Mounting evidence suggest heart failure metabolic imbalance characterize predominance catabolic status anabolic drive . The impressive example see end-stage HF know `` cardiac cachexia '' characterize strong weight loss , particularly lean mass rapid deterioration clinical condition , attribute prevalence catabolic pathway . If hormonal imbalance epiphenomenon important pathophysiological mechanism HF progression still matter debate . In particular deficit anabolic axis ( adrenal , gonadal somatotropic ax ) independent marker poor prognosis HF patient coexistence one deficiency identifies subgroup patient high mortality . The involved hormonal ax include growth hormone ( GH ) , tissue effector insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) , thyroid hormone , anabolic steroid . Taken together , alteration could recognize multiple hormonal metabolic deficiency syndrome ( MHD ) HF patient . MHD significant impact cardiac performance HF progression . The involved hormonal ax include growth hormone ( GH ) , tissue effector insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) , thyroid hormone , anabolic steroid . Taken together , alteration could recognize multiple hormonal metabolic deficiency syndrome ( MHD ) HF patient . MHD significant impact cardiac performance HF progression . Moreover , pattern Insulin-resistance ( IR ) quite common diabetic well non-diabetic CHF patient . IR find 30 % non-diabetic CHF patient related underlying disease severity . Few study consider reduction IR new therapeutic target . In brief , could argue CHF patient show anabolic/catabolic imbalance due multiple neurohormonal axis disequilibrium . Anabolic hormonal deficiency usually describe men chronic heart failure ( CHF ) contribute anabolic/catabolic imbalance ultimately result skeletal muscle waist cardiac cachexia . Counteracting anabolic deficit seem play beneficial clinical effect CHF patient . In fact , increase serum level testosterone growth hormone ( GH ) /insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) axis obtain hexogen administration , improve key symptom CHF exercise intolerance muscle fatigue positively impact quality life . Besides hexogen administration , increase level anabolic hormone obtain physical exercise . In healthy subject , testosterone may increase remarkably acute response endurance heavy resistance exercise . Similarly , GH concentration generally increase response strength endurance exercise thereby stimulate IGF-1 production . Although hormonal modulation could one mechanism exercise training exerts beneficial effect CHF patient , data endogenous exercise-induced increase anabolic hormone patient . Aside nature training activity , effect training may vary different dose parameter , specifically program length , session duration frequency workload intensity . In severely impaired patient , initial exercise intolerance , session may initially limited 3-5 minute duration 3 4 session complete course day ; however , recent work suggest total exercise energy expenditure standardize intermittent exercise training program may elicit superior benefit heart failure patient compare continuous exercise training session . High intensity , repeat intermittent work period separate recovery period show efficacious heart failure patient , interval stress show effective continuous workload old , healthy post coronary artery bypass surgery population . In systematic review 81 heart failure ExT study two report peak VO2 change 10 % 20 % respectively compare 16.5 % overall change continuous exercise training similar improvement strength training . The underlie theory high intensity , intermittent stress likely promote peripheral adaptation produce concurrent improvement functional capacity . Recent work show reduction brain natriuretic peptide , marker myocardial stretch , may great high intensity ( 90 % peak VO2 ) , rather moderate intensity ( 70 % peak VO2 ) exercise training patient severe leave ventricular dysfunction . A recent meta-analysis show intermittent exercise elicit superior improvement peak VO2 VE/VCO2 slope compare continuous exercise train heart failure patient . Few study evaluate hormonal response interval training CHF . However , relatively small sample size , lack control group relatively short time exercise intervention limit conclusion . The present study aim investigate whether 24-week high intensity interval training might exert beneficial effect modulate neurohormonal axis CHF patient . Furthermore , effect detrain neurohormonal axis CHF patient evaluate .</detailed_description>
