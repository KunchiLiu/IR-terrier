	<brief_summary>Powered exoskeleton emerge recently , promise offer walk individual severe spinal cord injury unable walk . We use ReWalk exoskeleton train walk individual chronic , severe spinal cord injury . We determine characteristic individual benefit training , identify neuroplasticity induced training . We determine feasibility ReWalk home community ambulation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Restoring Walking With Powered Exoskeleton After Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , pilot , cohort study design recruit participant train intensively 3 month period . The training session document detail , include number step take , speed walking , distance walking . Once walk speed plateaued , evaluate feasibility use device home-like environment community . At end study , good idea capability ReWalk assist walk severe SCI . We good understand individual likely benefit ReWalk . We know train ReWalk change neural connection brain spinal cord well guide train protocol . Finally , identify limitation ReWalk home community use , exoskeleton improve future maximize benefit people SCI .</detailed_description>
