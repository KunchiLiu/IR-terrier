	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol contribute overarch purpose , determine inhibit bioactivation acetaminophen ( APAP ) prevent liver injury , describe initiate mechanism APAP induce liver injury . APAP induce liver injury cause metabolism and/or result metabolite APAP undergoes reductive metabolism via cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) system , principally via CYP 2E1 . Inhibition CYP 2E1 activity protects toxicity rodent tissue culture 1 , 2 . Our prior research indicate inhibition CYP 2E1 administer pediatric preparation APAP contain Propylene Glycol ( PG ) , know CYP 2E1 inhibitor , result reduce production CYP 2E1 derive metabolite via competitive inhibition . In propose protocol investigator provide therapeutic dos APAP separately administer non toxic dose PG two-week period healthy subject . 20-75 % healthy people take therapeutic dos APAP 7-28 day asymptomatic subclinical rise transaminase level return baseline without adverse effect therapy . 3 The return baseline occur despite continued dose APAP ( hear review 9 17 ) . A primary purpose determine PG , fact , substance liquid preparation responsible effect investigator observe investigator initial study . A secondary purpose obtain plasma sample secondary metabolomic analysis elucidate effect CYP 2E1 inhibition . Specific Aims - 1 To demonstrate co-administration PG APAP prevents rise AST/ALT expect approximately one third subject follow therapeutic dose APAP day . - 2 To show PG administer APAP reduces toxic P450-derived metabolite production follow therapeutic APAP administration . - 3 To obtain plasma sample undergo metabolomic analysis determine effect CYP 2E1 inhibition set APAP administration . - 4 : To undergo metabolomic analysis day LFT 's peak determine difference metabolomics parameter subject receive propylene glycol plus acetaminophen versus acetaminophen alone .</detailed_description>
