	<brief_summary>The investigator assess feasibility intraoperative use C-arm cone-beam CT image intraoperative dosimetric evaluation prostate low-dose-rate ( LDR ) brachytherapy . Patients recruit receive standard LDR brachytherapy prostate cancer treatment . Consenting patient undergo additional 3D C-arm cone-beam CT imaging ( 3D C-arm ) motorize trans-rectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) . Volumetric dosimetric measure compare use standard Day-0 CT image . The investigator hope intraoperative 3D C-arm provide quality assurance measure sufficient eliminate need Day-0 CT LDR brachytherapy provide opportunity intraoperative modification seed delivery plan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Objectives - The primary objective study determine feasibility replace Day-0 CT intra-operative 3D C-arm imaging . The main benefit change receive immediate feedback quality treatment . This lead possibility perform `` live '' adjustment treatment plan base feedback actual seed position achieve implantation . - Secondly , replace Day-0 CT , separate scan perform different site eliminate treatment procedure , free CT scanner clinical use 2 . Hypotheses - Primary hypothesis : Intraoperative use 3D C-arm cone-beam CT eliminate need Day-0 CT post-implant dosimetry prostate LDR brachytherapy provide similar improve dosimetric accuracy - Secondary hypothesis 1 : Dosimetric value obtain TRUS probe inside rectum significantly different measure probe outside rectum - Secondary hypothesis 2 : Sagittal TRUS image provide good seed boudnary detection dosimetric purpose compare transverse image 3 . Justification Standard post-implant quality assessment BC Cancer Agency involve pelvic CT 2-3 hour treatment . This scan perform outside operating room , different location . As result , possible receive immediate feedback quality treatment . Furthermore , soft tissue visualization poor CT image contour variability large . The use image modality ultrasound would beneficial . However , since scan perform different time , patient different position , register image would challenge . Intra-operative C-arm CT imaging would provide immediate feedback quality treatment , provide opportunity use information intra-operative ultrasound image soft tissue visualization , eliminate need separate scan different location . 4 . Research method Patients receive low-dose-rate brachytherapy consent participate undergo additional imaging intervention describe section 5.7 application . Patients also undergo pelvic CT standard care . To limit patient exposure additional radiation dose , investigator divide participant 3 group , receive portion abovementioned scan . Details describe attach protocol . Seed location identify 3D C-arm volume . The prostate volume TRUS image delineate contour map onto 3D C-arm volume compute standard dosimetric parameter ( V100 , D90 ) . Seeds contour outline correspond Day-0 CT standard dosimetric parameter compute . Day-0 CT contour multiple observer compute variability result dosimetric parameter . Dosimetric value 3D C-arm compare Day-0 CT intra-observer variability . The seed identify 3D C-arm volume TRUS probe insert retracted create two seed cloud . Corresponding seed match . The difference seed location two seed cloud use model prostate deformation due presence absence TRUS probe . 5 . Statistical analysis This mainly descriptive one-arm study . No comparative statistical test apply</detailed_description>
