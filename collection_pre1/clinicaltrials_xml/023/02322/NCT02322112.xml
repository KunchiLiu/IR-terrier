	<brief_summary>Too much body-fat link low-grade inflammation throughout body . This inflammation think cause different disease , like heart disease diabetes . A low amount inflammation usually see people follow high fiber diet . A reason microbes live gut . Fiber main food source microbe . This allow fiber actually change type microbe live gut . Also , fiber get ferment microbe , health-promoting waste product get release . We aim determine exactly gut microbe contribute health property fiber . We hypothesize fiber 's health property depend gut microbe respond fiber . To test , plan add three different fiber diet healthy overweight obese individual six week . We determine different fiber affect individual ' health look establish marker health change add fiber . Following , see individual 's gut microbes respond add fiber . The response decide look change microbe community , well ability ferment fiber . By connect health outcome gut microbe ' response , test gut microbe ' response fiber determine fiber 's ability effect health . If understand gut microbe respond different fiber importance response . Then could personalize diet great impact improve health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Alberta FYBER ( Feed Your Gut Bacteria morE fibeR ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Being overweight obese significantly increase risk develop numerous disease , include cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , certain cancer . The microbial community ( microbiota ) reside within gut play notable role obesity associate pathology ( e.g . CVD , T2D ) , therefore potential therapeutic target . Diet known determine whether gut microbiota contribution host metabolism beneficial detrimental . A westernized diet high fat sugar associate systemic inflammation , fat intake increase lipopolysaccharide translocation gut membrane . In addition , gut microbial metabolism choline L-carnitine produce trimethylamine , show contribute atherosclerosis oxidize liver trimethylamine N-oxide ( TMAO ) . In contrast , diet high dietary fiber fruit , vegetable , whole grain inversely associate inflammation potentially reverse effect high fat diet . Fermentable fiber type resist host digestion , subsequently ferment gut microbiota short-chain fatty acid ( SCFAs ) , know metabolic immunologic benefit . Accordingly , epidemiologic association human intervention trial suggest inverse association fiber intake , reduce systemic inflammation , improve lipid glucose metabolism ; however , result remain inconsistent . These discrepancy might partly attributable ( I ) low fiber dos use study , ( II ) high degree inter-individual variation response fiber , may stem individualized response microbiome fiber . The emerge evidence fiber gut microbiota interact influence host physiology warrant human clinical research investigate capacity chemically distinct fiber modulate host metabolism inflammation , mechanistic role gut microbiota physiological effect . Our long-term goal contribute framework clinical research apply holistic approach examine effect fiber host gut microbiota . We hypothesize fiber show structure-dependent effect inflammatory , metabolic , hormonal marker obesity-associated pathology predict compositional , functional , genetic characteristic individual 's fecal microbiome . We propose follow specific aim : AIM 1 . Perform parallel-arm exploratory intervention study overweight mildly obese individual determine impact high dos chemically distinct fiber host inflammatory marker , measure insulin sensitivity , clinical outcome . The effect two physicochemically distinct fermentable dietary fiber ( acacia gum resistant starch type 4 ) clinical marker metabolic disease compare relatively non-fermentable dietary fiber ( microcrystalline cellulose - control ) . We employ three-arm , parallel-design , single-blind , placebo-controlled , stratified randomize exploratory trial . Fibers administer relative pure form daily six week without lifestyle adjustment . Doses use trial 25 g/day fiber woman 35 g/day men ( close Health Canada 's dietary recommendation ) . Although , first two day treatment use half daily treatment dose fiber ( woman : 12.5 g/day ; men : 17.5 g/day ) , ease incorporation fiber diet . Participants advise incorporate fiber diet , improve tolerance compliance . The impact dietary fiber comprehensive set well-established obesity-related biomarkers determine via quantification baseline post-dietary intervention . High sensitive C-reactive protein inflammatory marker ( e.g . interleukin-6 , interleukin-10 ) , well establish marker metabolic syndrome ( e.g . fast glucose triglyceride ) constitute key endpoint exploratory trial . To gain understanding mechanism mediate metabolic inflammatory improvement ; five primary gut hormone , include satiety/hunger signal hormone ( e.g . glucagon-like peptide-1 , leptin , ghrelin ) , include . Lifestyle indicator , compliance treatment , satiation assess self-administered questionnaire . AIM 2 . Evaluate short- long-term impact chemically distinct type dietary fiber gut microbiota composition , genetic characteristic , production anti-inflammatory ( SCFA ) pathogenic ( TMAO ) metabolites . We utilize Illumina 16S rRNA sequence whole metagenomic sequencing characterize fecal microbiota ( enrich large bowel bacteria ) exploratory trial participant week 0 , 1 , 6 , explore fiber-induced change gut microbiota composition gene content . These method use majority gut microbiota currently culturable . To investigate gut microbiota function , quantify specific bacterial associate metabolite plasma ( TMAO ) feces ( SCFAs bile acid ) . In parallel , quantify fecal metabolite vitro fermentation , account absorption human gut . This allow u gain insight fiber-induced change gut microbiota composition , metabolism , functionality coincide physiological effect observe host . AIM 3 . Characterize association clinical outcome microbiome shift determine well individual microbiome configuration predict impact dietary fiber . With establishment robust human exploratory trial , well-defined set host phenotype , participant microbiome characteristic , Aim 3 statistically integrate data specifically test association diet , gut microbiome , host metabolism , evaluate microbiome host phenotypic signatures baseline predict clinical outcome dietary fiber</detailed_description>
