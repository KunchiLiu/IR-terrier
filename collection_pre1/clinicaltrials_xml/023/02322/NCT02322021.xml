	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Participants must meet follow criterion include Core Study ( Prerandomization Randomization Phases ) : 1 . Meets core clinical research criterion NIAAA MCI due AD ( consistent Prodromal AD ) AD dementia 'staged ' classify either MCI mild moderate dementia . 2 . Amyloid positive Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) image base centralize PET scan reading . 3 . Male female , age 50 85 year , inclusive time consent . 4 . Must identify caregiver informant willing able provide followup information participant throughout course study . 5 . If receive Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor ( AChEI ) memantine , must stable dose least 12 week Baseline cognitive assessment , plan dose adjustment foreseeable future . Treatmentnaive participant enter study plan initiate treatment AChEIs memantine time entry study . 6 . Must stable dos permit chronically use concomitant medication ( ie , relate cognitive decline ) least 4 week randomization . Participants must meet follow criterion include OpenLabel Extension ( OLE ) Phase study : 1 . Participants complete 18month treatment 12week followup period ( Visit 20 ) Core Study whose Visit 20 fall within 4week window start OLE Phase ( Visit 21 ) . Permission must obtain Medical Monitor Visit 21 occur 4 week Visit 20 . 2 . Participants must continue identify caregiver informant willing able provide followup information participant throughout course OLE Phase . Exclusion criterion : Participants meet follow criterion exclude Core Study : 1 . Any neurological condition may contribute cognitive impairment beyond cause participant 's AD pathology , include comorbidities cerebrovascular disease , detect medical history , neurological examination , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . 2 . History transient ischemic attack stroke within 12 month Screening . 3 . History epilepsy . 4 . Evidence depression rating scale Screening psychiatric diagnosis symptom , ( eg , hallucination , major depression , etc . ) could confound diagnosis could interfere study assessment procedure . This include suicidal ideation suicidal behavior within 6 month prior Screening , hospitalization treatment suicidal behavior past 5 year . 5 . Abnormally low serum vitamin B12 . 6 . Thyroid stimulate hormone normal range . This apply participant regardless whether take thyroid supplement . 7 . Participants liver disease ( hepatic impairment ) , Screening Baseline . Participants Gilbert 's syndrome need exclude . 8 . Not able MRI , PET scanning , CSF collection Lumbar Puncture ( LP ) ( applicable participant consent CSF sample collection ) . 9 . Severe visual hearing impairment would prevent participant perform psychometric test accurately . 10 . History immunodeficiency disorder . 11 . Participants chronic viral hepatitis . 12 . History Tuberculosis ( TB ) . Participants history TB test previous TB exposure positive test exclusionary . 13 . History ophthalmic shingle ocular Herpes Simplex Virus ( HSV ) infection . 14 . Any live vaccine 3 month active infection within last 4 week study drug administration ( i.e . randomization ) . 15 . Any chronic inflammatory disease adequately control require immunosuppressive immunomodulatory therapy . 16 . T helper cell , cytotoxic T cell , B cell absolute count normal . 17 . Immunoglobulin ( Ig ) IgG , IgA , IgM level normal Screening Baseline , unless Investigator Medical Monitor agree find clinically significant . 18 . Clinically significant deviation normal physical examination , vital sign , clinical laboratory test Screening Baseline . 19 . Exclusionary cardiac factor include : prolonged QT interval great 450 millisecond ( msec ) electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) ; history risk factor torsade de pointes use concomitant medication prolong QT/QTc interval ; leave bundle branch block ; persistent low high heart rate ; persistent low high blood pressure ; history cardiac arrhythmia ; clinically significant ECG abnormality . 20 . Type 1 Type 2 diabetes mellitus well control . 21 . Malignant neoplasm within 5 year Screening ( except basal squamous cell carcinoma situ skin , localized prostate cancer require systemic therapy ; exclude participant ) . 22 . Medical condition ( eg , cardiac , respiratory , gastrointestinal , renal disease ) stably control , , opinion investigator ( ) , could affect participant 's safety interfere study assessment . 23 . Hypopigmentation condition ( eg , albinism vitiligo ) . 24 . Known suspected history drug alcohol dependency abuse within 2 year , current use recreational drug positive urine drug test . 25 . Planned surgery require general , spinal , epidural anesthesia would take place study . 26 . Participation interventional clinical study relate cognitive impairment within 6 month Screening unless document participant placebo treatment arm . 27 . Currently enrol another clinical study use investigational drug device within 60 day 5 halflives investigational medication ( whichever longer ) proceed informed consent . 28 . Hypersensitivity study drug excipients Beta Secretase Cleaving Enzyme ( BACE ) inhibitor , PET tracer , component formulation . 29 . Females lactate pregnant . Females childbearing potential agree adhere protocol specify method avoid pregnancy . 30 . Males meet protocol requirement avoid partner become pregnant . Sperm donation permit . Participants meet follow criterion exclude OLE Phase study : 1 . Participants discontinue study drug prematurely Core Study eligible participate OLE Phase . 2 . Participants active infection within 4 week Visit 21 3 . Participants absolute lymphocyte count lower limit normal ( LLN ) within 10 day Visit 21 4 . Participants develop follow condition time screen Core Study start OLE Phase : 1 . Hepatic impairment , total bilirubin great 1.5 Ã— upper limit normal ( ULN ) International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) great 1.7 . Participants Gilbert 's syndrome need exclude basis elevate bilirubin , provide sign symptom suggestive hepatic impairment . 2 . Any contraindication MRI scanning , include cardiac pacemaker/defibrillator ferromagnetic metal implant ( eg , skull ; cardiac device approve safe use MRI scanner ) 3 . Severe visual hearing impairment would prevent participant perform psychometric test accurately 4 . Immunoglobulin ( Ig ) deficiency immunodeficiency disorder 5 . Chronic viral hepatitis 6 . Tuberculosis 7 . Ophthalmic shingle 8 . Ocular herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) infection 9 . Any chronic inflammatory disease adequately control require systemic ocular immunosuppressive immunomodulatory therapy . Participants : Seasonal perennial allergic rhinitis , asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease condition consider stable adequately control inhaled steroid need exclude Hashimoto 's thyroiditis stable thyroid replacement therapy systemic immunosuppressive therapy need exclude Cutaneous manifestation immunological disease require systemic immunosuppressive therapy systemic immunomodulatory therapy need exclude ( topical steroid treatment permit ) 10 . Malignant neoplasm ( except basal squamous cell carcinoma situ skin , localized prostate cancer require systemic therapy ; exclude subject OLE ) . 5 . Participants prolong QT interval correct Fridericia correction formula ( QTcF ) Visit 20 Visit 21 . Participants single 12lead ECG QTcF &gt; 450 msec 2 additional ECGs perform least 1 minute apart mean QTcF triplicate ECGs calculate . Participants mean QTcF value &gt; 450 msec eligible enter OLE Phase . 6 . Participants significant pathological finding brain MRI include limited : area superficial siderosis ; evidence cerebral vasogenic edema ; evidence cerebral contusion , encephalomalacia , aneurysms , vascular malformation , infective lesion ; evidence multiple lacunar infarct stroke involve major vascular territory , severe small vessel , white matter disease ; space occupy lesion ; brain tumor ( however , lesion diagnose meningiomas arachnoid cyst le 1 centimeter great diameter need exclusionary ) . 7 . Participants `` yes '' answer Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( CSSRS ) suicidal ideation question 4 5 Visit 20 Visit 21 suicidal behavior study prior start OLE Phase . 8 . Females lactate pregnant . Females childbearing potential agree adhere protocol specify method avoid pregnancy . 9 . Participants medical condition ( eg , cardiac , respiratory , gastrointestinal , renal disease ) stably control , , opinion investigator ( ) , could affect participant 's safety interfere study assessment . 10 . Any clinically significant abnormal finding vital sign , ECGs laboratory test would , investigator 's opinion , affect particiapant 's safety interfere study assessment OLE Phase</criteria>
