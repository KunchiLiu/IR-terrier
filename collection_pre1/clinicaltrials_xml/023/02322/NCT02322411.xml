	<brief_summary>The overall goal randomize control pilot study characterize effect SwallowSTRONG® Device-Facilitated Isometric Progressive Resistance Oropharyngeal ( DF I-PRO ) therapy dose response framework swallowing-related outcome group unilateral ischemic stroke patient . These result use determine adequate sample size order support large clinical trial focus efficacy therapy approach improve swallow safety . The first aim determine difference swallow physiology bolus flow measure ) group unilateral ischemic stroke subject undergo SwallowSTRONG® DF I-PRO therapy control b ) 8 12 week treatment . The second aim examine change level oral intake swallow quality life post-stroke patient undergo DF I-PRO therapy compare control group relate treatment duration response 8 week 12 week . The third aim evaluate effect DF I-PRO therapy overall health status reflect number pneumonia diagnose overall hospital readmission rate post-stroke subject undergo DF I-PRO therapy compare control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Oropharyngeal Strengthening Dysphagia Patients Post-stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dysphagia estimate occur 76 % acute stroke patients1,2 2030 prevalence stroke estimate rise 21 % .3 Serious health complication may result presence dysphagia follow stroke , include development aspiration pneumonia , malnutrition , mortality.4-6 Developing pneumonia post-stroke result significantly increase relative risk ( 2.99 ) death within 30 day hospital discharge.1 Compensatory approach intervention , include posture diet modification , commonly use enact lasting change swallow function . Early intensive therapy approach suggest attainment optimal swallow outcomes.7 The tongue primary propulsive force movement bolus oral cavity pharynx cervical esophagus swallow . Patients post-stroke demonstrate low normal maximum isometric lingual pressure , measure pressure produce tongue push hard possible palate.2 Progressive resistance training tongue relate oropharyngeal musculature show improve swallow physiology quality life patient post-stroke.8 Previous study examine Isometric Progressive Resistance Oropharyngeal ( I-PRO ) therapy facilitate Iowa Oral Pressure Instrument ( IOPI ) lingual strengthening . The recently develop SwallowSTRONG® device consist customize , adjustable mouthpiece provide pressure reading embed sensor allow consistent tongue placement , immediate knowledge performance level , automatic calculation therapeutic strengthen target . Results federally-funded Department Veterans Affairs Clinical Demonstration Program employ use device-facilitated ( DF ) I-PRO therapy show improved swallowing-related outcome group patient oropharyngeal dysphagia result variety medical etiologies.9 The effect therapy approach various aspect swallow function health status group post-stroke patient yet examine . In addition , ideal treatment duration use stroke patient unknown . The long term goal work develop effective , evidence-based treatment improve overall health status relate swallowing-specific change patient dysphagia . The preliminary group data generate provide basis line work dedicate determination effective treatment patient post-stroke . Specific Aims include : 1 ) determine difference swallow physiology bolus flow measure ) group unilateral ischemic stroke subject undergoing DF I-PRO therapy control group b ) two duration treatment ( 8 12 week ) ; 2 ) examine change level oral intake swallow quality life post-stroke patient undergo I-PRO therapy compare control group relate treatment duration response 8 week 12 week ; 3 ) evaluate effect DF I-PRO therapy overall health status reflect number pneumonia diagnose overall hospital readmission rate post-stroke subject undergo DF I-PRO therapy compare control . In order address aim , thirty patient suffer unilateral ischemic stroke recruit . Subjects randomize receive either 1 ) 12 week DF I-PRO therapy plus compensatory treatment 2 ) compensatory treatment . Assessments take place baseline , 8 12 week . The primary outcome measure change maximum isometric tongue pressure . Details regard specific outcome influenced approach dose response effect inform clinical practice Speech-Language Pathologists facilitate strengthen regimen become standard treatment stroke relate dysphagia .</detailed_description>
