	<brief_summary>Background : - The drug filgrastim ( rGCSF ) increase number blood-forming cell bloodstream . These cell collect donor bloodstream use transplant . Studies show rGCSF present breast milk nursing mother take . Based study , recommend nursing mother breastfeed time receives first dose drug 2 day final dose . Researchers want study amount drug effect cell present donor blood breast milk . They hope good understand effect drug breast milk . Objectives : - To understand effect filgrastim breast milk . Eligibility : - Women enrol NIH protocol 00-CC-0165 currently breastfeed . Design : - Participants receive rGCSF daily 5 day . They blood take daily . - Participants get freezer bag contain 10 sterile , label container breast milk collection . - Participants transfer breast milk pump one container . They write date time milk collect container . They freeze sample . Any remain milk dispose . - Participants bring sample NIH day stem cell collection procedure . - For day 1 2 stem cell collection , participant continue collect freeze breast milk sample dispose remain milk . - For day 3 5 stem cell collection , participant collect freeze sample . They also resume normal breastfeeding . - A research nurse arrange collect sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( rhGCSF ) routinely administer volunteer peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) donor National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) . Information excretion pharmacokinetics rhGCSF human breast milk , however , extremely limited . Two case report exist , first demonstrate subcutaneously administer rhGCSF present breast milk,1 second demonstrate rhGCSF present , also remain breast milk two day discontinuation medication.2 Based data latter case report , NMDP suggest donor abstain breastfeed administration rhGCSF 48 hour last dose rhGCSF give . We intend collect test breast milk peripheral blood one volunteer NMDP donor course rhGCSF therapy 5 day thereafter , intention well characterize rare unique situation . Collected sample use granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( GCSF ) quantitation complete blood count . Additionally , collect single breast milk sample three rhGCSF-na ( SqrRoot ) volunteer use negative control sample assay calibration .</detailed_description>
