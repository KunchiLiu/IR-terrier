	<brief_summary>The goal Cellular Tissue Based Therapy Registry ( CTPR ) Wounds provide real world patient data electronic health record submit meet Stage 2 Meaningful Use order understand value product among patient chronic wound ulcer . Randomized , control trial establish product efficacy routinely exclude patient co-morbid condition common patient see usual clinical practice thus result RCTs tend non-generalizable . Little known effectiveness CTPs among typical patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal Cellular Tissue Based Therapy Registry ( CTPR ) Wounds provide comparative effectiveness data patient chronic wound ulcer understand whether clinical practice guideline follow use product . These product refer variety name inaccurate reflection structure purpose ( e.g . Cellular Engineered Tissue Alternatives , `` bioengineered tissue , '' `` biological dressing '' ) . The preferred term cellular and/or tissue base product ( CTPs ) . CTPs utilized biological influence heal process stimulate support heal . They may may incorporate regenerate tissue . Both tissue derive biosynthetic product may make without dead cell biomaterials make live cell may comprise autologous cell ( culture culture ) , xenogenic , allogenic cell ( minimally manipulate , culture , immortal ) .The diversity product rate become available clinical use make impossible perform randomize control trial compare effectiveness one another . Effectiveness real world patient best current option understand role CTPs wound heal . Hospital base outpatient wound center participate US Wound Registry agree provide data part quality initiatives meet Stage 2 Meaningful use criterion . The CTPR subset USWR data . All patient data participate outpatient clinic transmit USWR available benchmarking , PQRS initiatives . Data use effectiveness research HIPAA de-identified . These data derive structured language entry directly transmit electronic health record also link bill charge document practitioner sign lock chart , confirm veracity data entry .</detailed_description>
