	<brief_summary>The main purpose pilot study test effect thiamine ( vitamin B1 ) administration major cardiac surgery . Half patient receive thiamine half receive placebo . The investigator ' main hypothesis thiamine improve cellular oxygen consumption lead decrease level post-operative lactate level ultimately improve patient outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over 230,000 patient United States undergo Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ( CABG ) year . While mortality relatively low , morbidity remain substantial significant risk prolong time mechanical ventilation , prolonged length hospital intensive care unit stay many complication . CABG cause profound stress response significant metabolic alteration occur , include shift aerobic anaerobic metabolism , cause increase level pyruvate lactate . Elevated lactate , marker anaerobic metabolism , common significant finding patient CABG correlate increased mortality morbidity . Aerobic metabolism occur pyruvate enters mitochondria pyruvate decarboxylation acetyl-Coenzyme A , facilitate enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase ( PDH ) . Decreased PDH activity may cause shift toward anaerobic metabolism play role change see patient undergoing CABG . Thiamine ( vitamin B1 ) key co-factor PDH function increase activity even non-deficient state . The investigator hypothesize thiamine administration increase PDH activity patient undergo CABG , lead increase cellular oxygen consumption , represent decreased lactate level surgery , ultimately improved clinical outcome . In order test investigator ' hypothesis obtain data large-scale clinical trial evaluate relevant clinical endpoint , investigator conduct randomized , double-blind , pilot trial thiamine high-risk patient undergo CABG .</detailed_description>
