	<brief_summary>Metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) remain incurable disease despite improvement effect systemic treatment . After relapse first-line non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor , current clinical practice treatment guideline include tamoxifen , fulvestrant ( ER antagonist ) exemestane available option ( NCCN treatment guideline 2012 ) , context resistance , efficacy poor . Some result confirm possibility improve efficacy tamoxifen metastatic set combination therapy target signal transduction pathway . Other transduction pathway seem involve endocrine sensitivity/resistance , RAS/RAF/MEK/MAK pathway . LY2228820 inhibit activity p38 MAPK ( selective inhibitor α β isoforms p38 MAPK vitro ) reduce phosphorylation cellular target , MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 ( MAPKAP-K2 ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Women histologically confirm breast cancer 18 &lt; age &lt; 80 year old Menopausal status Women consider postmenopausal child bear potential 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g. , age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) 6 month spontaneous amenorrhea serum FSH level &gt; 40 mIU/mL estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider child bear potential ERpositive status local laboratory testing ( &gt; 10 % IHC ) HER2negative status ( IHC 0 1+ 2+ FISH negative ) last biopsy surgical specimen available . Disease progression define inoperable locally advanced metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) exclude aggressive visceral disease require approach , chemotherapy Disease refractory aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) define : recurrence , within 12 month end adjuvant treatment aromatase inhibitor , progression , within 3 month end AI locally advance MBC Patients receive fulvestrant eligible Maximum 2 previous line chemotherapy MBC Performance Status ( PS ) ≤ 2 Patient able swallow retain oral medication Measurable evaluable lesion per RECIST 1.1 Measurable disease ( ≥ 20 mm conventional technique ≥ 10 mm spiral compute tomography scan ) Nonmeasurable lytic mixed ( lytic + blastic ) bone lesion absence measurable disease . Patients pleural effusion and/or ascites eligible . Adequate bone marrow organ function define follow laboratory value : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.0 x 109/L Platelets ( plt ) ≥ 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 9 g/dl INR ≤ 1.5 without anticoagulation treatment Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Alanine aminotransferase ( AST ) aspartate aminotransferase ( ALT ) within normal range ( &lt; 3.0 x ULN liver metastasis present ) Total serum bilirubin within normal range ( ≤ 1.5 x ULN liver metastases present ; total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN direct bilirubin within normal range patient well document Gilbert 's Syndrome , define presence several episode unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia normal result CBC count ( include normal reticulocyte count blood smear ) , normal liver function test result , absence contribute disease process time diagnosis Patient sign informed consent obtain trial related activity accord local guideline • Previous treatment p38 MAPK inhibitor Tamoxifen metastatic setting ( adjuvant treatment tamoxifen allow ) More 2 line chemotherapy locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer Brain metastasis Other malignancy ( exception adequately treat , basal squamous cell carcinoma , nonmelanomatous skin cancer curatively resect cervical cancer ) .
