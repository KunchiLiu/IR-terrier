	<brief_title>Conscious Sedation With Nitrous Oxide Control Stress During Dental Care Individuals With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Were invite accepted participate study , 77 individual Cerebral Palsy attend outpatient clinic San Francisco Home School ( SFHS ) time data collection . This study serve non-randomized experimental trial conduct 2011/2012 dental ambulatory SFHS . Dental care routine establish , standardize procedure ensure reproducibility method sedation . In initial consultation , medical history taking ( collect sociodemographic data participant ) dental examination perform . Data relate Cerebral Palsy clinical standard collect medical record patient noted evaluation sheet develop specifically research . Were provide guardian clarification regard sedation technique treatment planning . At dental examination diagnostic criterion caries follow propose World Health Organization ( WHO ) . On second visit , patient stabilize dental chair mechanical contention . Performed adaptation selection nasal mask , monitor equipment position , start observation record behavioral physiological record evaluation sheet . The proportion gas manipulate relative percentage nitrous oxide oxygen achieve optimal sedation . In study , consider good sedation Cerebral Palsy patient show certain degree relaxation , become cooperative treatment . Behavioral assessment relation dental treatment measure Venham 's Score , standard use behavioral assessment dental patient , measurement perform accord patient 's behavior dental procedure . Due subjectivity compose diagnosis disease behavior analysis , common occur variation result . In specific situation study , aggravation multiple observation conduct day , fatigue could lead inconsistent diagnosis . For reason , one patient per day receive dental care nitrous oxide ( N2O ) . In light consideration , two dentist calibrate evaluate behavior Venham 's Score . Behavioral physiological parameter evaluation patient refer dental treatment perform four stage : pre-sedation , induction , sedate patient end . Measures Heart Rate Respiratory Rate record time interval . The Heart Rate later correct physiological cardiac variability different age group patient .</detailed_description>
