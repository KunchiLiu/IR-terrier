	<detailed_description>Pain therapeutic challenge well public health problem estimate affect 116 million American adult [ 1 ] ; reduces quality life ; estimate cost $ 635 billion annually . Growing recognition need evidence-based , individual-centered treatment strategy raise expectation health care improve match proven effective treatment knowledge patient ' unique characteristic optimize efficacy safety . Essential goal match treatment patient enhance analgesic drug development therapy identification intermediate phenotype capture mechanistic complexity , genetic expression epigenetic change hundred ongoing process mediator influence treatment efficacy safety may form basis differential response drug therapy . The ability identify functional variant genomic response pain therapeutic sub-group patient level , however , limited date lack thorough phenotyping patient pain . The need comprehensive understanding human phenotype spawn new method phenotyping study refer `` deep phenotyping . '' Deep phenotyping pharmacogenomic study require breath depth well interpret complexity genomic variation may underlie individual difference pain report . One approach address complexity use quantitative test clinical feature identify homogeneous subset within group patient give diagnosis characteristic . Variations quantitative measure may identify intermediate phenotype genetically less complex yet potentially strong signal closer site gene action . In pain , quantitative test often term `` quantitative sensory test '' , QST . Exclusion 1 . Current history mental disorder substance abuse 2 . Allergy aspirin , NSAIDS , sulfonamide 3 . Pregnant and/or nursing 4 . History peptic ulcer and/or GI bleed 5 . Concurrent use agent may obscure pain report , e.g. , alcohol , opioids , benzodiazepine , depressant , etc 6 . Chronic use medication confound assessment inflammatory response analgesia , e.g. , antihistamine , NSAIDS , steroid , antidepressant 7 .
