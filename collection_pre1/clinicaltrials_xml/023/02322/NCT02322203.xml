	<detailed_description>This single center clinical pilot study investigate effect niacin blood lipid lipoprotein composition human subject healthy . Niacin ( vitamin B3 nicotinic acid ) common nutrient find many food currently sell counter nutritional supplement . Extended-release version niacin available counter ( e.g. , Slo-Niacin ) prescription ( Niaspan ) help alleviate symptom flush associated large dos vitamin . Studies effect niacin therapy clinical lipid measure consistently indicate shift toward healthy lipoprotein profile increase HDL-C decrease triglyceride LDL-C . Despite favorable shift lipid profile , cardiovascular outcome study patient receive niacin alone combination statin therapy result mixed result create uncertainty value niacin therapy . The propose study examine detail effect niacin therapy lipoprotein composition function , also track measure vascular health .</detailed_description>
