	<brief_title>Efficacy Tranexamic Acid Reducing Blood Loss During After Caesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Caesarean Section ( C.S ) common major surgical procedure perform woman worldwide rate continue rise steadily developed develop country ( Gibbons et al. , 2012 ) . Caesarean Section associate blood loss vaginal delivery ; trend increase rate develop develop country ( BetraÂ´n , 2007 ) . The National US Caesarean section rate level 32.8 % 2010 2011 ( Hamilton et al. , 2012 ) . Caesarean Section account 20-25 % delivery UK ( Fairley Dundas , 2011 ) . C.S rate increase high 25-30 % many area world , Pakistan ( C.S ) rate 25 % ( Najmi , 2000 ) . In many area China ( C.S ) rate high 40-50 % ( Zhang , 2008 ) . The main cause death follow ( C.S ) infection , hemorrhage , pulmonary embolism , anesthesia - associate complication , caesarean section important underlying cause death Norway contribute increase maternal death ratio last decade ( Vangen Bergsjo , 2003 ) . Delivery ( C.S ) cause complication normal vaginal delivery one common complication primary secondary postpartum hemorrhage 20 % ( Lu et al. , 2005 ) . Obstetric hemorrhage life threatening , therefore reduce morbidity mortality due obstetric hemorrhage need reduce bleed C.S ( Bingham , 2012 ) . Postpartum hemorrhage major cause maternal mortality , especially under-resourced country , account nearly one - quarter maternal death worldwide ( WHO , 2007 ) . Recent study develop country report increase rate postpartum hemorrhage , attribute ( least part ) arise rate C.S ( Bateman et al. , 2010 ) . As incidence Caesarean Section increase , average blood loss Caesarean Section ( 1000 ml ) double amount lose vaginal delivery ( 500 ml ) ( Magann , 2005 ) . The hematocrit fall 10 % blood transfusion require 6 % woman undergo Caesarean Section , Compared 4 % woman vaginal birth ( RCOG , 2004 ) . Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) synthetic derivative amino acid lysine exert anti-fibrin lytic effect reversible blockade lysine bind site plasminogen molecule . It use many year reduce blood loss surgery ( Astedt , 1987 ) . TXA show useful reduce blood loss incidence blood transfusion many surgeries.In gynecology obstetrics , TXA commonly use treat idiopathic menorrhagia effective well - tolerate treatment administer orally . Bleeding associated pregnancy ( placental abruption , placenta previa ) also treat TXA ( Dunn , 1999 ) . Furthermore , randomize control study show TXA reduces blood loss C.S ( As et al. , 1996 ) . No large randomize control trail efficacy TXA control blood loss C.S report , This randomize double blind , placebo control study evaluates efficacy TXA reduce blood loss C.S . Aim Work The aim study evaluate efficacy tranexamic acid reduce blood loss elective C.S . The Research Question Is Tranexamic acid effective reduce blood loss elective Caesarean section ? The Research Hypothesis The TXA could able reduce blood loss elective Caesarean section . The null hypothesis therefore state : There difference TXA placebo reduce blood loss elective Caesarean section . Patients Methods This prospective , randomize control trial carry Obstetrics Gynecology Department , Ain Shams Maternity Hospital . The study include 100 pregnant woman singleton fetus 38 week gestation divide two group . Study group include 50 woman control group include 50 woman . Women assign study group receive 1 gr TXA injection ( Kapron , AMOUN Pharmaceutical co. ) give slowly I.V 10 minute operation . The control group receive 30ml 5 % glucose . Both provider patient double-blinded conclusion study . The type anesthesia decide surgeon anesthetist counseling patient . The inclusion criterion trial include : - Pregnant woman age 20-40 singleton fetus 38 week . - Uncomplicated pregnancy , 3rd parity . - Women undergo scheduled elective C.S . Exclusion criterion include : - Causes uterine over-distention polyhydramnios macrosomia - Grand multi parity - Previous PPH ( 3 x risk ) previous history retain placenta - Pre-eclampsia pregnancy-induced hypertension - Maternal hypertension . - Pre-existing maternal hemorrhagic condition - Maternal diabetes mellitus . - Abnormal placenta - Sensitivity TXA . - Women take anticoagulant therapy . Assessment intraoperative blood loss start uterine incision collection suction blood weigh surgical towel . Post-operative blood loss assess first 24 hour weighingthe pad . HB level &amp; Hematocrit investigate 24 hour surgery . The weight dry towel subtract weight wet towel weight blood change volume use formula { density blood 1060/m3 ; slightly denser water volume blood = weight multiply 0,9 } ) . Sample size determination : Assuming rate intraoperative blood loss range 650ml group 1 &amp; 450ml group 2 SD 300ml , sample size 48 patient group enough detect difference , true , 0,05 alpha error 0,09 power test ( Kemal , 2010 ) . Randomization allocation : Interventional randomize control trial conduct use systemic random sample allocation . Dark seal envelope contain intervention take table number , create third party involved allocation process . Randomization perform pick one envelope patient sequentially numbered envelope day intervention initiation , nurse involve study patient inform allocation arm . Blinding : This randomize double blind trial , provider researcher blind reduce bias ; double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial , neither provider researcher know get placebo get treatment avoid information calculation bias . Ethical consideration inform consent This clinical trial propose ethical review committee Ain Shams University approval . An informed consent explain clinical trial possible side effect TXA obtain patient include trial .</detailed_description>
