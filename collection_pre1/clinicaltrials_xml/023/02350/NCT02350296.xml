	<detailed_description>As part Dompé extension line program , Dompé develop new immediate release tablet formulation ketoprofen lysine salt 40 mg . The new immediate release tablet formulation KLS 40 mg ( correspond 25 mg ketoprofen free acid ) expect essentially similar formulation ketoprofen 25 mg oral administration , already available European Community indication : pain episodic tension-type headache , dental pain , neuralgia , dysmenorrhoea , postpartum pain , muscular osteoarticular pain . The objective study investigate bioequivalence ( Cmax extent absorption ketoprofen single dose administration ) two formulation contain ketoprofen lysine salt ( KLS ) administer single oral dose two consecutive study period healthy male female volunteer fast condition . Furthermore , collect safety tolerability data single dose administration test reference . Due lack information PK profile new formulation possible calculate sample size properly . For reason decide use `` two stage '' bioequivalence study design . The sample size 30 subject regard sufficient satisfy primary objective first stage study . After end study stage 1 , PK parameter calculate ad interim bioequivalence test perform calculated PK parameter Cmax , AUC0-t AUC0-∞ . To safeguard overall type I error , Pocock spending function use determine α level bioequivalence test . Should bioequivalence proven result subject first stage posteriori calculated power least 80 % , primary objective study would satisfy second study stage take place . Should bioequivalence proven result subject first stage proven posteriori calculated power lower 80 % , overall sample size study ( stage 1 plus 2 ) calculate basis ad interim bioequivalence result . The Sponsor decide whether study continue . In first case , additional subject enrol second study stage . After completion stage 2 , PK analysis bioequivalence test perform pooled subject two study stage . The second stage perform notification sample size local Ethics Committee central Swiss authority ( Swissmedic ) . An open design choose consider adequate evaluate objective measure pharmacokinetic parameter . All personnel involve analytical determination ketoprofen plasma sample withdraw volunteer maintain blind . The sequence treatment two study period assign randomise subject accord computer generate randomisation list . A wash-out period least 4 day two administration justified elimination half-life ketoprofen ( 1-2 h ) .</detailed_description>
