	<brief_title>Endostar Combined With Paclitaxel Nedaplatin Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis recurrent metastatic esophageal squamous cell cancer poor . However , still standard chemotherapy regimen recommend disease lack trail . Currently , anti-angiogenesis therapy prove improve survival successfully colorectal cancer , non-small cell lung cancer , breast cancer , glioma kidney cancer . Recent study show high level VEGF negative correlate prognosis esophageal cancer . Endostar , novel endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor , prove significantly inhibit proliferation metastasis esophageal cell line animal model . A retrospective study also report safety efficacy combination therapy paclitaxel liposome recombinant human endostatin . Based basis , design phase Ⅱ study evaluate efficacy safety endostar combine paclitaxel nedaplatin first-line therapy treat patient recurrent metastatic esophageal squamous cell cancer .</detailed_description>
