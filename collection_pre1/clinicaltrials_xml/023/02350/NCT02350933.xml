	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether possible damage trachea cause prior prolonged intubation ( &gt; 24h ) observe rigid endoscopy trachea cuff tracheal tube cause less damage cuff tube .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Evaluation Paediatric Airway After Prior Prolonged ( &gt; 24 h ) Tracheal Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study systematically evaluate airway injury rigid endoscopy child ( 1 month 16 year age ) previous prolong ( &gt; 24h ) tracheal intubation special focus whether trachea intubate cuffed uncuffed tracheal tube . After induction anaesthesia obtain venous access , neuromuscular block agent administer facemask pre-oxygenation occur 2 minute . Direct laryngoscopy perform preoxygenated , paralyse conventionally monitored patient obtain direct vision . Then rigid endoscope endoscopy camera attach Storz Hopkins II 10020 ATA 0° endoscope carefully guide larynx carina monitor vision electronic recording . An International Study Board Committee ( assessor board ) ass endoscopic record blind manner use systematic grading system . Beside tracheal tube type , factor intubator , sedation management , age , length intubation , nasal oral intubation time point endoscopy affect presence , absence incidence potential airway injury cause prolonged tracheal intubation . Thus difficult perform power calculation figure number patient demonstrate exclude statistically significant difference tube type . Using incidence subglottic stenosis , worst case scenario outcome longterm intubation , incidence le 2 % seem reasonable uncuffed tracheal tubes.So primary hypothesis test equivalence major complication rate define subglottic stenosis compare cuffed versus uncuffed tracheal tube . Specifically , primary hypothesis relate main outcome criterion study , subglottic stenosis longterm intubation . The null-hypothesis Ho define difference incidence rate subglottic stenosis cuff uncuffed group . The null-hypothesis ( Ho : μ-Diff = 0 ) compare alternative hypothesis ( H1 : μ-Diff &lt; &gt; 0 ) . The study design detect clinically unacceptable deterioration 4 % baseline airway-injury rate 2 % use uncuffed tubes power 80 % type I error probability le 5 % . Sample size 376 cuffed group 376 uncuffed group achieve 80 % power 5 % significance level use one-sided equivalence test proportion proportion standard group ( uncuffed TT ) 0.02 proportion experimental group ( cuffed TT ) test equivalence 0.02 maximum allowable increase proportion still result equivalence ( range equivalence ) 0.04 . In total 1000 patient prior long-term intubation ( &gt; 24 hour ) use cuff ( 500 ) uncuffed ( 500 ) tracheal tube recruit / include different study centre .</detailed_description>
