	<brief_summary>Patients randomize receive HEALICOILâ„¢ REGENESORB ( study anchor ) TWINFIX Ultra HA , similar comparative product , use repair shoulder injury . They ask complete questionnaire throughout study receive MRI , CT multiple ultrasound image . The MRIs radiograph use assess bony ingrowth repair site , ultrasound ass repair success rate rotator cuff . The clinical radiological outcome compare study control group . It hypothesize 85 % high quality ossification anchor site HEALICOIL REGENESORB 49.9 % high quality ossification TWINFIX Ultra HA 24 month .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female , age 35 75 year time surgery . Willing able give voluntary inform consent participate investigation . Full thickness tear rotator cuff Tear require repair within one year initial diagnosis . Tear must anatomically repairable ( must able get tendon back medial position footprint least back tuberosity ) . Willing able , opinion Investigator , cooperate study procedure , willing return study site require postoperative study visit . Evidence acute trauma include fracture dislocation shoulder joint . Chronic retraction . Evidence active infection , osteomyelitis , sepsis distant infection , could spread index joint . Subject previous rotator cuff , arthroplasty fracture procedure operative shoulder . Subject acromioplasty diagnostic arthroscopy operative shoulder within one ( 1 ) year prior schedule surgery date . Evidence osteomalacia metabolic bone disorder ( ) , may impair bone soft tissue function . Evidence significant shoulder pathology include ( Type IIIV lesion , Bankart lesion , Hill Sachs lesion ) . Patient grade 4 change articular cartilage operative shoulder Inflammatory arthropathy . Significant muscle paralysis shoulder girdle . Painful pathology cervical spine . Comminuted bone surface , would compromise secure anchor fixation . Nonsurgical rotator cuff associate treatment , corticosteroid injection , within one ( 1 ) month prior schedule surgery date . Participating another investigational trial ongoing study would interfere assessment primary secondary outcome . Female patient pregnant , nursing , childbearing potential practicing effective contraceptive method . Major psychiatric illness , developmental handicap inability read understand English language . Major medical illness would preclude undergoing surgery . Known involve active injury litigation claim relate study shoulder . Unwilling unable assess accord study protocol two year follow surgery . Patient require concomitant SLAP repair procedure operative shoulder . Surgeon plan use Platelet Rich Plasma product another therapy intend augment heal rotator cuff study procedure . Protocol specify surgical technique follow subject . Rotator cuff repair do via open ( opposed arthroscopic ) procedure . Any reason ( judgment investigator ) .</criteria>
