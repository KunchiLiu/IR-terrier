	<brief_title>Microstructural Changes Brain During Recovery After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study embed large randomize control trial ( RCT ) ( ClinicalTrials.gov ID : NCT02337101 ) subject recruit separately examine possible microstructural change brain recovery mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) subject ongoing symptom 2 month mTBI group RCT . Several biomarkers brain area investigate possible site injury mTBI . The nature diffuse chronic post-concussion symptom ( PCS ) make corpus callosum ( CC ) , thalamus ( THA ) hippocampus ( HIP ) interest central position connection widespread motor , sensory cognitive process brain area . In prior study conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) fail detect pathology especially chronic phase mTBI . Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging ( DKI ) Diffusional Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) sensitive microstructural change might serve biomarkers brain mTBI . We hypothesize change symptom ( measured cognitive performance self report symptom ) correlate change microstructural change ( measure DKI ) thalamus , corpus callosum hippocampus baseline 2-6 month mTBI follow 6 month . Separate correlation also make treatment control group within cohort .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Concussion cause head trauma accord diagnostic criterion recommend Danish Consensus Report Commotio Cerebri within last 26 month . The criterion base recommendation WHO Task Force , amendment , must direct contact head object order rule pure acceleration deceleration trauma . Age 18 30 year time head trauma . Able understand , speak read Danish . Patients symptoms least three item Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire ( RPQ ) rat moderate severe problem . PCS subjectively rat cause substantial impairment daily life . Suitable MRI examination Objective neurological finding neurological examination / acute trauma CT scan , indicate neurological disease brain damage . Previous concussion lead persistent PCS within last two year . Severe abuse alcohol , prescription drug / illegal drug . Psychiatric morbidity severe neurological disease impede participation treatment , i.e . Bipolar Disorder , autism , psychotic disorder ( lifetime ) , multiple sclerosis etc .</criteria>
