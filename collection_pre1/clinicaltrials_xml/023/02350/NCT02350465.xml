	<brief_title>Detection Treatment Sarcopenia Myosteatosis Older African Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale study need proactively address health disparity associate age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction . Age-related change muscle may characterize sarcopenia ( i.e. , loss muscle mass ) and/or myosteatosis ( i.e. , excessive intramuscular adipose tissue ) . These change may result physical impairment may exacerbate lack formal screening diagnosis process old adult standard healthcare setting . Myosteatosis may compound effect sarcopenia play significant role age-related functional decline high incidence type 2 diabetes observed African Americans comparison ethnic/racial group . The initial phase study involve assessment old African Americans ( n = 70 ) characterize muscle size quality comparison young reference group ( n = 70 ) . Participants randomly select old subject pool assign either Eccentric Exercise Group Concentric Exercise Group 12 week supervise strengthen exercise regimen .</detailed_description>
