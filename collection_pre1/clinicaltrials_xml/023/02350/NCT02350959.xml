	<brief_title>Adverse Plaque Characteristics CCTA TVC Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct two phase - Phases 1 2 . In Phase 1 , vulnerability plaque see CCTA assess TVC Imaging System , plaque volume lipid core content plaques versus without adverse plaque characteristic compare . For purpose study , study phase cross-sectional study shape vulnerable plaque see CCTA compare vulnerability visualize TVC Imaging System . In Phase 2 , patient multi-vessel ( polyvascular ) disease participate Phase 1 include , study phase longitudinal study serial TVC imaging perform non-target vessel , difference change plaque vulnerability treat moderate-dose versus high-dose statin comparatively analyze . The purpose present study determine whether significant difference change plaque volume stability treat high-dose versus moderate-dose statin .</detailed_description>
