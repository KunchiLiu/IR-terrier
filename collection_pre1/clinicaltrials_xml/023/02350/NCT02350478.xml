	<detailed_description>Patients type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) increase risk macrovascular event well microvascular complication . It well know , pathophysiologic process type 2 diabetes start many year diagnosis make basis elevate fast blood glucose . In particular data United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) study UKPDS post trial monitoring highlight importance early glucose lower intervention patient T2DM respect micro- macrovascular complication . The investigator particular Euro Heart survey Diabetes Heart demonstrate , cardiovascular high risk population , namely patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , 35 % suffer manifest type 2 diabetes . In addition , another 9 15 % CAD patient postchallenge diabetes , diagnose basis oral glucose tolerance test , mean approximately half patient CAD diabetes . Recently investigator could demonstrate establish type 2 diabetes diagnosed basis fast hyperglycaemia associate increase cardiovascular risk , also postchallenge hyperglycemia ( i.e . impaired glucose tolerance postchallenge diabetes ) . Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) inhibitor increase endogenous glucagon like-peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) level GLP-1 turn increase insulin release pancreatic beta-cells glucose dependent manner well suppress glucagon secretion pancreatic alpha cell . Investigations type 2 diabetic patient show drug class lower , fast postchallenge postmeal glucose level hence , HbA1c well tolerate . However , lower surrogate measurement HbA1c necessarily turn translate reduce number cardiovascular event patient T2DM . In contrary particular thiazolidinedione Rosiglitazone concern increase risk cardiovascular event raise despite robust HbA1c lower effect.Therefore Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) issue 2008 2010 , respectively , guidance new glucose lowering drug , require proof least cardiovascular safety . Cardiovascular outcome trial Linagliptin currently perform ( CAROLINA , CARMELINA ) , however , take couple year result available.A well know validate cardiovascular surrogate parameter endothelial dysfunction . The investigator others show previously , endothelial dysfunction present patient coronary artery disease early diabetes improved pharmacological intervention . This surrogate measurement could helpful good understand cardiovascular effect Linagliptin await result definitive outcome trial . The aim study investigate effect Linagliptin coronary patient early T2DM various cardiovascular surrogate measurement include mechanical biochemical endothelial function assessment . The overarch aim study investigate effect Linagliptin endothelial function , arginine bioavailability ratio postchallenge glycaemic control patient early diabetes coronary atherosclerosis .</detailed_description>
