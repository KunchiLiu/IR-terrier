	<brief_summary>Background Hepatic metastasis colorectal cancer ( MCC ) quite common major source morbidity mortality . There evidence show hepatic arterial chemoembolisation use DC bead ( drug elute bead , 100-300μm ) load irinotecan ( DEBIRI ) show improved overall survival compare systemic therapy ( FOLFIRI ) , large limitation . New 70-150μm bead recently available currently limit data concern use . Safety bead test local patient . Hypothesis / Aim To study safety pharmacokinetics small 70-150μm DEBIRI pilot study 5 patient . The small 70-150μm bead able deliver consistent high dose tumoral tissue small systemic dose . Being small less embolic , also well tolerate . Patients also genotyped UGT1A1*28 UGT1A1*6 polymorphism status latter genotype associate decreased clearance irinotecan SN-38 Asian patient . Methods Single centre , pilot study , prospectively recruit 5 patient unilobar disease , refractory systemic chemotherapy The primary endpoint : 1. establish safety toxicity profile irinotecan load DEBIRI bead 2. establish pharmacokinetics systemic exposure irinotecan active metabolite , SN-38 . The secondary outcome measurement : 1. incidence severity adverse event , liver function parameter laboratory abnormality ; 2. response rate , 3. progression free survival 4. overall survival Clinical Significance This treatment modality advantage directly deliver irinotecan liver metastasis colorectal cancer . This local mode drug delivery may result high intratumoral drug concentration rapid tumour shrinkage lead downstaging hepatic metastatic lesion . These therapeutic outcome may also downstage patient hepatic resection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Recruitment : Suitable potential subject identify , namely fail first second line chemotherapy agent . 2 . Liver biopsy Right 1st transarterial chemoembolisation procedure , liver metastasis biopsied ultrasound CT guidance IR 18G core biopsy needle . Tissue send histological analysis well store molecular study NCCS . 3 . Transarterial chemoembolisation procedure ( DEBIRI TACE ) : 100mg irinotecan load DEB solution least 2 hour procedure pharmacy . Diagnostic angiography ( DSA ) perform fluoroscopic guidance , commonly via right groin puncture . Using dedicated catheter , arterial supply liver tumour involved segment determine . A solution 75-150 μm DEBIRI mix non-ionic contrast medium ( 1:1 ) inject artery feeding metastasis . For unilobar disease , two treatment plan , maximum 100mg irinotecan load DEB , separate four week . Intravenous fentanyl administer procedural pain relief . Post procedural pain relief medication give deem necessary physician . For bilobar disease , four treatment plan , alternate right left lobe , separate 2 week duration , maximum 100mg irinotecan load DEB . Intravenous fentanyl administer procedural pain relief . Post procedural pain relief give deem necessary physician . Technical success define delivery DEBIRI stasis reach hepatic artery . Patients expect stay hospital least day monitor adverse event , follow clinic . Procedures delay physician 's discretion : - Liver function test bilirubin 5-folds normal value - Absolute neutrophil count less 1500 cells/µL - Platelet count le 100,000/µL - Severe adverse event . Should patient development significant extrahepatic metastasis time course trial , refer clinician may choose stop trial and/or offer patient treatment modality e.g . radiotherapy line chemotherapy . 4 ) Follow : Patients expect stay hospital least day monitor adverse event , follow clinic . All patient see clinical 1 week procedure FBC LFT determination perform . They see clinic 1 week prior next procedure . Patients follow 3 month last procedure . Serum drug level adverse event monitor . Imaging response determine modified RECIST criterion . A CT scan perform 1 month 3 month completion procedure evaluate treatment response . Tumor response determine use modify RECIST criterion ( 7 ) . 5 ) Pharmacokinetics irinotecan Blood sample ( 3 mL ) pharmacokinetic analysis collect follow time point administration first dose day 1 : 0 minute ( pretreatment blank ) , 1h , 2h , 4h , 8h 24h hour postinfusion . Blood immediately centrifuge 2000 g fifteen minute , plasma transfer 1.5 mL polypropylene tube store -20°C . Irinotecan metabolite , SN-38 SN-38G assay use LC-MS/MS method . The purpose perform pharmacokinetics would quantitate AUC irinotecan , SN-38 SN-38G plasma . 6 ) Pharmacogenetics Analysis Pharmacogenetic analyse UGT1A1*28 UGT1A1*6 do patient prior administration irinotecan accordance previously publish study laboratory ( 6-9 ) . All participate patient venous blood sample ( 3 mL ) drawn genomic DNA collection EDTA tube label patient 's identification number , date collection , age , ethnic group sex . Unused DNA sample patient enrol genotyping arm store -20°C future pharmacogenetic investigation related irinotecan research . Patients inform write consent take . 8 ) Potential Risks benefit Anticipated benefit : 1 . Reduction size liver lesion hence prolong survival 2 . Meeting criterion liver resection metastases Possible risk : Adverse event related procedure include : 1 . Access site injury 2 . Hepatic artery injury 3 . Non target embolization result acute cholecystitis , peptic ulcer , pancreatitis etc . 4 . Post embolization syndrome , manifest fever , malaise , right upper quadrant pain , nausea , vomit 5 . Hepatic abscess biloma 6 . Biliary stricture 7 . Liver failure Adverse event related irinotecan include : 1 . Diarrhea 2 . Vomiting 3 . Leucopenia 4 . Anemia 5 . Thrombocytopenia 7 . Abdominal pain 8 . Fever All chemotherapeutic toxicity grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria ( NCI CTC version 3 ) . Hematological Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) define follow : grade 4 neutropenia &gt; 7 day duration , neutropenic fever , grade 4 anemia grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia occur first cycle treatment . 9 ) Adverse event Using Health Science Authority 's Safety Reporting Clinical Trials ( June 2011 ) , serious adverse event ( experience ) reaction untoward medical occurrence dose 1 .
