	<brief_summary>For several year , postural disorder assessment hemiplegic patient conduct force plate , use center plantar pressure displacement static position . These widely use physical therapy assessment rehabilitation patient balance disorder . For hemiplegic patient , asymmetric distribution support foot increase surface area postural sway ( marked medio lateral axis ) observe . These study , base study plantar pressure , enough providea full description spatio-temporal organization postural component hemiplegic patient . Indeed , postural stabilometric evaluation base simplification human skeleton consider simple inverted pendulum swing ankle . This simplify model ca n't use dynamic assessment simultaneous contribution several joint movement . This restrict clinical interest patient expose imbalance fall dynamic situation . Thus , hip angular movement result center plantar pressure displacementwhich impossible discriminate ankle axis movement use stabilometric signal . Thus , seem interesting study another variable valid dynamic condition : displacement center mass dynamic balancing task . This variable obtain 3D motion capture different segment human body . The dynamic test dynamic postural assessment follow ball avoidance three different direction . The center mass displacement compare functional test know representative dynamic balance individual capacity : The Timed Up Go test ( TUG ) . All data aim improve hemiplegic postural assessment physical therapy help develop new rehabilitative approach .</brief_summary>
