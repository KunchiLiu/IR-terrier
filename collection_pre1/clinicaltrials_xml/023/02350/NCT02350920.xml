	<brief_summary>Over 18,000 Irish people affect inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis . These illness often arise young age associate significant physical disability . In addition , considerable psychosocial disability associate IBD . Previous study suggest simple psychological intervention may valuable improve quality life may even improve disease activity . However , comprehensive trial determine precise effect psychological intervention quality life ( QOL ) , stress disease activity . Our aim conduct randomise control trial simple psychological intervention determine 's effect QOL stress</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , include Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis , chronic condition often arise young patient may lead lifetime physical disability . Psychological disability also prevalent patient chronic disease epidemiological study indicate IBD patient increase risk anxiety mood disorder , depression rate double match community sample ( 27 % versus 12 % ) . IBD patient also increase risk illness-related psychological difficulty include body image concern , sexual problem reduce self-esteem . Therapeutic approach inflammatory bowel disease naturally focus treatment minimise disease activity normalise physical function . Thus , considerable research conduct 5 ASA medication , steroid , immune modulators biologic agent . In contrast , little attention pay important , 'low-technology ' , issue include quality life psychological comorbidities include depression , anxiety , stress , alter body image , sexuality , illness attitude , self-esteem psychosocial IBD co-morbidities . Nevertheless , patient report data outcome increasingly incorporate research informs strategic healthcare document , turn , help formulate healthcare policy . Contemporary European British guideline emphasise benefit patient centre service supply psychological well medical support ( Elkjaer M , et al ) . In addition burden psychological disease place upon IBD patient , evidence psychological morbidity stress also associate disease activity . IBD patient depression experience disease flare diagnosable psychological condition ( Mittermaier C , et al ) Canadian study also suggest stress associate disease flare ( Bitton A , et al ) . In contrast , Spanish study 163 patient conclude stressful life event trigger exacerbation IBD patient ( Vidal A , et al ) . Overall , likely relationship stress disease activity bi-directional one influencing extent . To date , intervention aim reduce psychological distress IBD tend focus either psychological education , stress management include relaxation technique autogenic training , psychodynamic psychotherapy , cognitive behavioral therapy hypnosis . Studies variable regard psychological content almost multiple methodological limitation , make difficult draw conclusion value intervention . Perhaps comprehensive review psychological study IBD , include 16 study ( Knowles SR , et al ) , conclude psychological intervention make positive contribution best practice multidisciplinary IBD treatment , well design study need determine efficacy different treatment . We aim conduct multicenter randomise control trial determine efficacy Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) psychological wellbeing IBD patient . We aim include 80 patient longitudinal study ( 40 arm ) . IBD patient attend St Vincent 's University Hospital Beaumont Hospital treat protocol driven inflammatory bowel disease clinic therapy adhere international treatment guideline . We currently use protocol develop European Crohn 's Colitis Organisation ( ECCO ) American Gastroenterology Association ( AGA ) . Our care incorporate formalise multidisciplinary teamwork standardise clinical monitoring , use contemporary biomarkers disease activity full range current therapy include 5-ASA steroid medication , immunological therapy , open laparoscopic surgery appropriate , endoscopic treatment necessary late biological agent per protocol . Thus , study take place clinical environment adhere modern practice . Initial assessment 1 . Biological assessment The initial assessment comprise standardise validated questionnaire determine biological status . Specifically , ass : Demographic data Region , urban/rural , race , age , education , martial status , family history , occupation , employment status , smoke alcohol history Nutritional status Body Mass Index Exercise status Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire IBD history Disease type , duration , clinical , therapeutic surgical history , Hospital admission visit , GP visit Disease activity Harvey Bradshaw Index ( CD ) , Mayo Score ( UC ) , physical examination Medication adherence Medication Adherence Report Scale 5 ( MARS5 ) Laboratory indices Biochemical , immunological haematological variable , faecal calprotectin , hair cortisol 2 . Psychological assessment This include validate instrument build structured picture IBD illness . We assess : General Quality Life Short Form 12 , Healthy day IBD specific QOL Short Health Scale Stress/anxiety/depression Depression Anxiety Stress Scales ( DASS ) 21 Stress Thermometer Self Esteem Rosenberg Self Esteem Survey Body Image Modified Hopwood Body Image Scale Disease acceptance Acceptance Action Questionnaire - Revised Interventions Group 1 ) Control ( n=40 ) The control group consist 40 patient receive treatment 26 week receive ACT program . Group 2 ) Acceptance Commitment therapy ( n=40 ) ACT behavioural therapeutic approach use process acceptance , mindfulness , commitment behaviour change increase psychological flexibility . In term ACT IBS specifically , use guiding patient develop willingness come contact unpleasant experience physical symptom feel embarrassment , anticipatory anxiety distress thought commonly associate IBS . The former agenda try eliminate symptom distress cognitive emotional state replace agenda focus create meaningful life IBS . Assessments intervention period Weekly assessment perform intervention period . These include Harvey Bradshaw Index ( CD ) , Mayo Score ( UC ) , Short Health Scale , ( DASS ) 21 Stress Thermometer Eight week assessment 1 . Biological assessment Medication adherence Medication Adherence Report Scale 5 ( MARS5 ) Nutritional status Body Mass Index Exercise status Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire Disease activity index Harvey Bradshaw Index ( CD ) , Mayo Score ( UC ) Laboratory indices Biochemical , immunological haematological variable , faecal calprotectin , hair cortisol 2 . Psychological assessment General Quality Life Short Form 12 , Healthy day IBD specific QOL Short Health Scale Anxiety/Depression Beck Depression Inventory , Beck Anxiety Inventory Stress Depression Anxiety Stress Scales ( DASS ) 21 Stress Thermometer Self Esteem Rosenberg Self Esteem Survey Body Image Modified Hopwood Body Image Scale Sexuality Modified Golombok-Rust Inventory Disease acceptance Acceptance Action Questionnaire - Revised 26 week assessment Repeat 8 week assessment Hair Cortisol Measurement The effect stress mediate stress hormone cortisol . Cortisol involved regulation glucose lipid metabolism , body composition , immune system . Cortisol traditionally measure serum saliva . However , cortisol secrete circadian rhythm pulse , time sample collection crucial measuring cortisol serum saliva . In addition , cortisol stress hormone , acute stress , cause research setting venepuncture , influence measurement . A single measurement cortisol serum saliva therefore poorly reflect medium long-term cortisol level . An alternative method measure cortisol scalp hair . This method offer long-term measurement cortisol level , 1cm hair represent cortisol level approximately one month . In last year , measurement cortisol scalp hair well validate ( Gow R , et al ) . We measure hair cortisol initial assessment , conclusion therapy ( 8 week ) 26 week visit .</detailed_description>
