	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) systemic disease , mainly target joint result osteoarticular destruction serious disability . When clinical symptom ( painful swollen joint ) occur , innate adaptive immune response self antigen already largely amplify . This might explain even RA patient treat early aggressively , remission disease obtain approximately half . This proportion remission treatment achieve use treat target strategy involve biologics , anti-TNF . Unfortunately , less 20 % patient remain remission treatment discontinuation . Thus , despite availability 5 different type biologics , still therapeutic unmet need . However , spontaneous , drug-free decrease disease activity observe physiological condition , pregnancy . Although treatment RA discontinue pregnancy , mark improvement , sometimes remission , observed pregnancy , frequent post-partum flare . The situation opposite increase risk flare systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , rare systemic autoimmune disease generally progress flares-up affect nearly organ ( skin , joint , kidney , brain , heart , â€¦ ) . The course disease remain unpredictable give patient , biomarkers available help clinician identify patient risk flare . Thus , safe therapeutic option remain limited , especially patient serious complication . A specific concern SLE fact disease usually start woman enter sexual reproductive life . Even stable condition ( i.e : lupus without recent flare impair renal cardiac function ) medically recommend get pregnant , 40 % SLE patient flare pregnancy . We hypothesize disease-specific pregnancy-induced epigenetic change , especially regard pattern level microRNAs , could explain clinical improvement risk flare RA SLE , respectively . A good understanding underlying mechanism could help identify new biomarkers , notably predict flare SLE , therapeutic target , try mimic amplify micro-RNA change observe RA target SLE .</brief_summary>
