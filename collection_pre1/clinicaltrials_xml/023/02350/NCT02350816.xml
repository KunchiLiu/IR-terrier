	<criteria>Patients must meet follow criterion consider eligible enrollment : 1 . Patient complete least Week 48 visit Study HGTSAN093 2 . The patient 's parent ( ) legally authorize guardian ( ) must voluntarily sign Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) / Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) approve informed consent form relevant aspect study explain discuss . Consent patient 's parent ( ) legally authorize guardian ( ) patient 's assent , relevant , must obtain Patients exclude study follow criterion meet : 1 . The patient , randomize treatment Study HGTSAN093 , experience decline 20 point BSIDIII cognitive DQ score Baseline Week 48 visit Study HGTSAN093 , AND , upon individual evaluation Investigator , deem treatment failure* 2 . The patient experience , opinion Investigator , safety medical issue contraindicate treatment HGT1410 , include limit clinically relevant intracranial hypertension , severe infusionrelated reaction treatment HGT1410 , uncontrollable seizure disorder 3 . The patient know hypersensitivity component HGT1410 4 . The patient enrol another clinical study , HGTSAN093 , involve clinical investigation use investigational product ( drug [ intrathecal/spinal ] device ) within 30 day prior study enrollment time study 5 . The patient know suspected hypersensitivity anesthesia think unacceptably high risk anesthesia due airway compromise condition 6 . The patient condition contraindicate described SOPHAPORT® Mini S IDDD Instructions Use , include : 1 . The patient , may , allergic reaction material construction SOPHAPORT ® Mini S device 2 . The patient 's body size small support size SOPHAPORT ® Mini S Access Port , judge Investigator 3 . The patient 's drug therapy require substance know incompatible material construction 4 . The patient know suspect local general infection 5 . The patient risk abnormal bleeding due medical condition therapy 6 . The patient one spinal abnormality could complicate safe implantation fixation 7 . The patient function CSF shunt device 8 . The patient show intolerance implant device 7 . The patient unable comply protocol ( eg , unable return safety evaluation , otherwise unlikely complete study ) determine Investigator All treat patient Study HGTSAN093 cognitive development assess Week 48 Visit Study HGTSAN093 . If decline Baseline 20 point less BSIDIII DQ score observe , patient may proceed Study SHP610201 without evaluation . If decline Baseline 20 point DQ score observe , individual evaluation Investigator occur determine patient treatment failure . This individual evaluation take account DQ score , VABSII score , physical status , information available patient time . If Investigator deem patient treatment failure , patient may enter Study SHP610201</criteria>
