	<brief_summary>This adaptive Positron Emission Tomography/ Computed Tomography ( PET/CT ) Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( DCE-MRI ) open-label study design investigation inflammation adult rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patient , involve therapeutic intervention . Each study participant undergo two half body PET/CT scan pelvis bottom foot ( include hand wrist ) additional bed position centre shoulder . One scan conduct 18F-FDG 18F-GE-180 . The first PET/CT scan ( PET1 ) perform 4 week ( 28 +/- 2 day ) first screen visit , whereas second PET/CT scan ( PET2 ) carry within 2 week ( 7 +/- 7 day ) PET1 . The order PET/CT scan subject base computer generate randomisation schedule screen visit . A sub-group study participant invite undergo additional dynamic 18F-GE-180 PET scan select joint ( knee wrist ) prior 18F-GE-180 PET/CT half body scan . The primary objective study quantify inflammation joint RA patient determine 18F-FDG 18F-GE-180 uptake use PET , DCE-MRI parameter .</brief_summary>
