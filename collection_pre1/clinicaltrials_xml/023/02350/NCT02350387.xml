	<brief_title>Efficacy Eccentric Resistance Training Persons With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arthritis lead cause disability United States . Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common type arthritis affect nearly 27 million Americans . Knee OA common type osteoarthritis estimate affect 42.1 % woman 31.2 % men age 60 . Osteoarthritis likely multi-factorial several underlying cause . It longer consider `` degenerative joint disease '' rather process involve dynamic biomechanical , biochemical , cellular process . It involve degeneration articular cartilage , also inflammation synovium , change underlie subchondral bone , development osteophyte . Currently , appear numerous systemic factor lead initiation OA different causal pathway . These systemic cause amplify local factor trauma increase loading cause obesity . Currently , `` cure '' OA attempt find disease modifying drug unsuccessful . Thus , treatment currently focus mitigate factor know affect radiographic progression disease well lead activity limitation participation restriction.9,10 Decreases low extremity strength major cause activity limitation give vital role strength activity daily live . One method use mitigate progressing factor use exercise program . Many type exercise use successfully literature include resistance training . Resistance train take many different form isometric , isotonic ( concentric and/or eccentric ) isokinetic various intensity . Presently , little evidence use eccentric training intervention patient knee OA . This study aim examine type resistance training OA population . Therefore , purpose study examine effect low intensity , long duration eccentric resistance training high intensity , short duration eccentric resistance training individual knee OA . Ideally , study allow u determine overall effect eccentric resistance training well potential difference two type eccentric resistance training .</detailed_description>
