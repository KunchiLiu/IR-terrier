	<brief_summary>Early accurate diagnosis one first crucial step care infant bear HIV-infected mother . Early initiation antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) rely upon early diagnosis result significant reduction infant morbidity mortality . The investigator recently conclude successful randomize controlled trial Kenya entitle , `` Improving uptake early infant diagnosis HIV prevention mother-to-child HIV transmission ( PMTCT ) : randomize trial text message intervention '' ( ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT01433185 ) . In study , text message develop use behavioral theoretical framework significantly improve maternal attendance post-partum clinic appointment rate test facilitate early infant diagnosis HIV select population control set . Understanding effectiveness intervention ( limitation ) real-world , routine-care set represent next step translational pathway public health impact . The investigator therefore propose cluster randomize , step wedge trial 20 clinic operate Kenyan Ministry Health Nyanza region Kenya use Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation , Maintenance ( REAIM ) framework understand effectiveness text message improve testing ( TextIT ) intervention . Our specific aim : 1 . To determine effect TextIT maternal attendance postpartum clinic visit randomize stepped-wedge rollout intervention . Hypothesis 1 : A great proportion woman health facility implement TextIT attend clinic within eight week postpartum compare woman health facility implement standard care . 2 . To determine effect TextIT virological infant HIV test within eight week birth randomize stepped-wedge rollout intervention . Hypothesis 2 : Infants woman health facility implement TextIT likely virological HIV testing compare infant woman health facility implement standard care . 3 . To determine cost cost-effectiveness TextIT . The investigator estimate cost per patient per health gain achieve ( disability-adjusted life year , DALY ) compare TextIT current standard care . Hypothesis 3 : The TextIT intervention cost-effective current standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The 2011 United Nations General Assembly Political Declaration HIV/AIDS set target eliminate mother-to-child transmission HIV 2015 . The continuum care woman live HIV baby include retention care early infant diagnosis HIV . Timely initiation infant antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) require HIV-positive woman retain care postpartum period bring child HIV testing . However , high proportion pregnant HIV-positive woman sub-Saharan Africa lose follow-up delivery . The World Health Organization recommend infant HIV test six week use DNA polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . However , overall proportion child undergo early infant diagnosis PCR remain low . In Kenya , overall proportion eligible child undergo PCR test 2011 39 % . Low rate infant HIV test indirect indication large number infant may benefit early determination HIV status , antiretroviral prophylaxis HIV-negative breastfeeding infant , infant feed counsel support . For HIV positive infant , failure undergo test critical barrier receive life-saving ART . There urgent need investigate efficacious , cost-effective , sustainable intervention improve maternal retention HIV care increase proportion expose infant test HIV . With exponential increase number mobile phone sub-Saharan Africa , use mobile technology support HIV program show promise . The United Nations Children 's Fund encouraging HIV program take advantage high level mobile phone access among enrolled mother remind return critical appointment . Active follow-up pregnant HIV positive woman resource-limited setting use mobile phone feasible , may effective improve postnatal retention uptake early infant diagnosis across different sub-Saharan African setting .</detailed_description>
