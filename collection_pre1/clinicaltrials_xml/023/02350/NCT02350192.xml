	<detailed_description>Introduction : Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death globally e-health educational program prove effective support CVD client . However , e-health program lack personalization seldom result exercise behavioral change . Considering advantage e-health program , well widespread internet use rise trend young patient CVD Hong Kong , conduct Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) investigate effectiveness home-based interactive e-health educational intervention versus usual care total physical exercise , exercise adherence self efficacy , risk factor profile , psychological outcome quality life middle age cardiac vascular ( CV ) patient . Methods analysis : This prospective randomise clinical trial investigate effectiveness home-based interactive e-health educational intervention middle-aged cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) adult improve total exercise , adherence rate , exercise efficacy outcomes . The hypothesis middle-aged CVD patient ( 40-65 year old ) would likely adhere exercise-based behavior improves total exercise , exercise adherence rate , cardiac risk profile , psychological outcome quality life support interactive e-health educational intervention . The RCT conduct two government cardiac clinic Hong Kong . 438 eligible CV client randomize either control group ( C ) intervention group ( I ) use block randomization method . All participant receive usual care ( I ) additionally receive e-health educational intervention ( eHEI ) programme . This programme comprise one-hour educational session , one telephone follow e-health link self monitor include record health measure physical exercise across 6 month . Data collect baseline , three month six month interval . The primary outcome total physical exercise ( GSLTPAQ ) . Secondary outcome consist : exercise efficacy adherence rate ; CV risk profile ; physical psychological health outcome ( SF12 &amp; HAD ) ; biological parameter . Data analyze use generalize linear model . Ethics dissemination : The study complies Declaration Helsinki approve University hospital ethic committee .
