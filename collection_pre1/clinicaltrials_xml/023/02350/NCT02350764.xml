	<criteria>Patient must capable , willing , able provide write , informed consent . ≥ 18 year old . Advanced stage NSCLC Previously treat two line prior systemic therapy advance stage lung cancer . Patients previously receive neoadjuvant , concurrent , adjuvant chemotherapy localize NSCLC recur within 6 month complete chemotherapy may consider receive one line prior therapy Maintenance therapy count separate line therapy Patients must : Be schedule undergo standardofcare resection tumor tissue part treatment plan prior begin study therapy . Patients may intervene systemic anticancer therapy time resection treatment nivolumab . Have collection adequate pretreatment tissue correlative analysis define sufficient material 1 ) frozen tissue DNA/RNA touch prep/representative slide confirm tumor material present , 2 ) FFPE material ICH touch prep/representative slide confirm tumor material present , 3 ) singlecell suspension &gt; 20 million live cell tissue digestion freezing . Adequacy collect material determine within 5 business day collect case . Have residual disease follow surgical resection measurable RECIST v1.1 Previously irradiate site tumor may consider measurable radiographic progression site subsequent time complete radiation . Have safely biopsiable tumor lesion ECOG performance status 01 . Adequate hematologic , renal , and/or hepatic function ( follow criterion must meet within 28 day C1D1 : WBC ≥ 2,000/ul ANC ≥ 1,500/ul Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl Platelet count ≥ 100,000/ul Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( unless evidence Gilbert 's syndrome , case , direct bilirubin must ≤ 1.0 x ULN ) AST ALT ≤ 3 x UNL ( unless elevate transaminase felt directly relate metastatic disease involve liver , case AST ALT must ≤ 5x ULN ) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN estimate creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min calculate use formula Cockcroft Gault : ( 140Age ) • Mass ( kg ) / ( 72 • creatinine mg/dL ) ; multiply 0.85 female There restriction number prior line systemic anticancer therapy . For received prior systemic anticancer therapy , must least 3 week since last systemic therapy . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 3 day prior start study drug . Effective contraception : Women childbearing potential must agree practice 2 effective method contraception time sign informed consent form 23 week ( 5 halflifes plus 30 day , duration ovulatory cycle ) last dose nivolumab , agree completely abstain heterosexual intercourse . Male subject , even surgically sterilize ( i.e. , status post vasectomy ) must agree 1 following : practice effective barrier contraception entire study treatment period 31 week ( 5 halflives plus 90 day , duration sperm turnover ) last dose study drug , completely abstain heterosexual intercourse . Patients pregnant lactate . Presence activate EGFR mutation ALK rearrangement , unless previously treat standard TKI therapy . All patient adenocarcinoma histology must test EGFR ALK status . History allergy study drug component history severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody . Prior treatment immune checkpoint inhibitor , include ( limited ) target PD1 , PDL1 , PDL2 , CTLA4 , CD137 , GITR , TIM3 , LAG3 , OX40 Any systemic anticancer therapy within 3 week prior C1D1 study therapy Exception make patient EGFR ALK rearrangement must stop TKI therapy least 7 day prior C1D1 Patients previously treat platinumbased base doublet chemotherapy , judgment investigator , rapidly progressive disease serious complication may arise disease progression within next 12 week exclude . NonCNS radiotherapy within 1 week prior C1D1 study therapy Active infection require therapy Prior systemic immunosuppressive therapy ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) within 1 week prior C1D1 study therapy . Inhaled , ocular , intraarticular , intranasal , topical corticosteroid permit absence active autoimmune disease . Adrenal replacement dos permit absence active autoimmune disease . Patients know suspected history autoimmune disease . Subjects type I diabetes melitis , hypothyroidism require hormone replacement , resolve childhood asthma/atopy , patient asthma require intermittent bronchodilator therapy , skin disorder ( vitiligo , psoriasis , alopecia ) require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . Other active malignancy require concurrent intervention . Patients previous malignancy ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer , follow situ cancer : bladder , gastric , colon , cervical/dysplasia , melanoma , breast ) exclude unless definitive therapy complete least 1 year prior study entry patient without evidence disease malignance additional therapy require anticipate required study period . Known untreated brain leptomeningeal metastasis . Patients brain metastasis eligible metastasis adequately treat neurologically return baseline ( except residual sign symptom related CNS treatment ) least two week prior C1D1 . In addition , must also requirement immunosuppressive dos systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 2 week prior study drug administration . Patients interstitial lung disease symptomatic may interfere detection management suspect drugrelated pulmonary toxicity . Any positive test HIV Any positive test HCV RNA HBsAg .</criteria>
