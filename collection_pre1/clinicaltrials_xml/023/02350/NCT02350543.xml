	<brief_summary>This study evaluate continuation ( non-discontinuation ) Aspirin TURBT . Half participant continue usual low-dose Aspirin regimen TURBT throughout perioperative period , half discontinue Aspirin use ten day prior surgery ( standard recommendation ) restart therapy two week post-discharge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peri-operative Aspirin Continuation Versus Discontinuation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , American College Chest Physicians 2012 clinical guideline perioperative anti-thrombotic therapy associate TUR bladder tumour ( TURBT ) increase risk bleeding associate anti-thrombotic therapy . Despite , contemporary series TURBT identify rate significant in-hospital postoperative bleed 2-3.4 % . Previous prospective work group demonstrate increase postoperative hemorrhagic complication early initiation Aspirin follow TURBT . These finding support recent retrospective work TURBT show similar complication profile continue perioperative antiplatelet therapy antiplatelet naive patient . The risk associate Aspirin withdrawal prior surgery , include increase thrombogenicity , extensively study . Following cessation Aspirin , full platelet recovery expect within 12-14 day , however , hemostasis may regain little 20 % normal platelet activity . Further , evidence support platelet rebound phenomenon set acute Aspirin withdrawal resultant clinical prothrombotic state , thrombotic event peak ten day follow drug cessation . Finally , acute stress response postoperatively well know ; one component hypercoagulability last least seven day major uneventful abdominal surgery , predominantly cause increased platelet activity . Whereas TURBT generally carry low overall risk cardiac morbidity , general requirement discontinue Aspirin pre-operatively potentially increase certain patient ' cerebrovascular cardiac risk ( eg . post-coronary stent placement ) . As show , risk significant post-operative hematuria minimal , , Aspirin withdrawal may unnecessary . We perform prospective , randomize control trial address safety tolerability continue Aspirin use TURBT .</detailed_description>
