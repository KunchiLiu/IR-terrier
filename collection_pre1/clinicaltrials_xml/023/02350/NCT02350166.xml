	<brief_summary>Surgical resection still recommend optional treatment colorectal liver metastasis ( CLM ) patient . There two main concern resectable colorectal liver metastasis remain controversial : surgical time surgical type . As former , synchronous resection primary colorectal tumor liver metastasis , reason fare overall survival rate absence second surgery , gain wide population gastrointestinal surgeon believe bring benefit CLM patient . With regard surgical type , Open liver resection optimum choice CLM patient matter metastasis profile . And management primary tumor , laparoscopic procedure mature surgical skill evidence equivalent overall survival rate compare open resection . So , primary colorectal tumor resection could either open laparoscopic procedure . Therefore , investigator team conduct controlled trial compare two surgical procedure treatment resectable colorectal liver metastasis . Patients randomly assign conventional laparotomy group simultaneously resection primary colorectal tumor liver metastasis , laparoscopic-assisted small-incision group resection laparoscopic colorectal tumor combine synchronously small-incision open resection liver metastasis . The aim trial observe short-term operative effect surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short-term Effects LASI Surgery Versus Conventional Laparotomy Colorectal Liver Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nowadays , colorectal liver metastasis ( CLM ) gain wide population multi-disciplinary doctor include gastroenterologist , oncologist , hepatic doctor increase incidence poor prognosis . Nearly , 15 % -25 % colorectal cancer patient present simultaneous liver metastasis time diagnosis 20 % -35 % patient evaluate primary tumor liver metastasis resectable synchronously . Although use chemotherapy regimen certify favorable outcome , surgical resection still recommend optional treatment CLM patient . However , two main concern resectable colorectal liver metastasis remain controversial : surgical time surgical type . As former , late evidence show synchronous resection primary colorectal tumor liver metastasis , reason fare overall survival rate absence second surgery . Moreover , increase number surgeon favor synchronous resection initial experience believe bring benefit CLM patient . With regard surgical type , although laparoscopic liver resection proven feasible , safe efficient management liver metastasis , procedure limit select patient tumor size le 10 centimeter locate leave liver . In addition , laparoscopic liver resection technically difficult applied medical center . So open liver resection may optimum choice CLM patient matter metastasis profile . In management primary tumor , laparoscopic procedure mature surgical skill evidence equivalent overall survival rate compare open resection . A research conduct Arezzo also confirm low 30-day morbidity laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection . Unlike liver metastasis resection , primary colorectal tumor resection could either open laparoscopic procedure . Therefore , investigator team conduct controlled trial compare two surgical procedure treatment resectable colorectal liver metastasis . Patients randomly assign conventional laparotomy group simultaneously resection primary colorectal tumor liver metastasis , laparoscopic-assisted small-incision group resection laparoscopic colorectal tumor combine synchronously small-incision open resection liver metastasis . The aim trial observe short-term operative effect surgery .</detailed_description>
