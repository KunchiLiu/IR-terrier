	<detailed_description>The recent pharmacological technological advancement make paediatric anaesthesia safer , minimize thereby risk serious adverse event . Despite recent advancement , still significant incidence life-threatening complication follow general regional anaesthesia without complete identification predictive factor . Several cohort study report incidence perioperative anaesthetic complication , result generally limited single centre . Hence , prospective multicentre study `` APRICOT '' recently conduct order establish incidence severe critical event identify risk factor occurrence [ ClinicalTrials.gov identifier # NCT01878760 ] . This European Society Anaesthesiology Clinical Trial Network project currently progress 300 participate centre 25,000 patient , birth 15 year age , include . The NECTARINE specifically focus neonatal population . The NECTARINE aim include neonate infant birth 60 week postmenstrual age schedule elective urgent diagnostic surgical procedure sedation general anaesthesia without regional analgesia regional anaesthesia . The primary aim study identify occurrence peri-anaesthesia ( first 120 minute ) intervention need treat improve one following : ( 1 ) airway management , ( 2 ) oxygenation , ( 3 ) alveolar ventilation , ( 4 ) glycaemia Na+ , ( 5 ) cardiovascular instability , ( 6 ) body temperature , ( 7 ) brain oxygenation , ( 8 ) anaemia . The parameter clinical event trigger intervention specifically report . As secondary aim in- out- hospital morbidity mortality study 30 90 day anaesthesia . Following sample size estimation , plan recruit 5000 child period twelve consecutive week , include weekend after-hours across 30 European country represent European Society Anaesthesiology Council part geographical Europe . The 12-week recruitment period choose site commence 1 January 2016.The last possible inclusion date decide Study Steering Committee depend recruitment rate . Participating hospital provide data acquisition sheet enable anonymous standardized record patient ' parameter , use local institution fill electronic case report form . Descriptive statistical analysis perform primary endpoint ( occurrence severe critical event 95 % confidence interval ) . Univariate multivariate analysis perform test factor associate endpoint . Results logistic regression report adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) 95 % confidence interval .</detailed_description>
