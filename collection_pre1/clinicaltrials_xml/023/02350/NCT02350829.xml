	<brief_summary>Diffuse fibrosis ( scar ) heart muscle find variety congenital heart diseases cardiomyopathy ( heart muscle disease ) , consider mediator decrease cardiac function . The detection quantification diffuse myocardial fibrosis recently become feasible non-invasively , use cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) , apply new technique label T1 mapping . With technique , part heart tissue make muscle cell ( extracellular volume ) quantify , long individual 's hematocrit ( cellular volume blood ) know . The extracellular volume heart tissue regard quantifiable marker extent diffuse myocardial fibrosis . In propose study new T1 mapping technique shall applied patient different form congenital heart disease ( n=130 ) , cardiomyopathy ( n=40 ) control subject ( n=30 ) . The additional scan time due participation study approximately 5-10 minute , without change clinical protocol . The main objective study presence extent myocardial fibrosis T1 mapping CMR pediatric patient congenital heart disease cardiomyopathy , comparison cardiovascularly healthy control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T1 Mapping Diffuse Myocardial Fibrosis Congenital Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A good understanding mechanism heart muscle fail pediatric heart disease may result novel therapy direct prevent rather treat ventricular failure . The likely mediator candidate cardiac demise congenital heart disease well cardiomyopathies diffuse myocardial fibrosis non-favorable chronic biventricular remodel . As , fibrosis may marker , mediator , precede onset actual echocardiographic clinical deterioration , open opportunity timely target treatment . Chronic stressor myocardial function ( hypoxemia , abnormal afterload preload ) appear promote fibrosis . In group patient , genetically upregulated collagen metabolism seem play role . In adult patient dilate cardiomyopathy extent myocardial fibrosis predictive outcome . With cardiac magnetic resonance imaging , characterization myocardial tissue possible . Whereas standard late gadolinium enhancement ( LGE ) CMR identify patchy scar neighbor healthy tissue , quantification diffuse myocardial fibrosis live become feasible T1 mapping technique . Both technique ( T1 map LGE ) base principle MR contrast medium ( gadolinium ) trap collagen fibre retain area fibrosis quickly wash healthy myocardium . As gadolinium T1 shortening agent , fibrosed tissue 'trapped ' gadolinium shorter T1 time healthy tissue . T1 map measure T1 time constant , show correlate degree fibrosis . In refined approach technique , use , possible quantify extracellular space ( equivalent degree fibrosis ) T1 mapping . This method validate current gold standard surgical myocardial biopsy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients cardiomyopathy ( clinically establish diagnosis dilate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ) / Patients congenital heart disease ( Diagnosis Transposition great artery arterial switch operation , repair Tetralogy Fallot , patient single ventricle palliation Fontan stage ) schedule MR investigation include gadolinium ( MRI contrast medium ) Patients / guardian capable give informed consent Informed write consent / assent parent / legal guardian patient applicable Ability undergo MRI examination without anaesthesia . Children &gt; 6 year typically able cooperate sufficiently . Control Patients : Patients undergo noncardiac MR investigation ( musculoskeletal / abdomen / brain ) include gadolinium without history cardiac disease Consent / assent refusal guardian / patient General contraindication MRI examination nonMRI compatible metallic implant , claustrophobia . No contrast require clinical portion MRI Patients require anaesthesia MRI ( typically &lt; 6 year age ) Known renal failure previous allergic reaction gadolinium contain contrast agent Control subject : history cardiac problem , e.g . rhythm disorder , former myocarditis , active myositis inflammatory condition except suspect confirmed inflammatory bowel disease Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis Known pregnancy breast feeding</criteria>
