	<brief_title>Preventing Loss Independence Through Exercise ( PLIE ) Persons With Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal propose study perform randomize , control trial ( RCT ) test efficacy novel integrative exercise program call Preventing Loss Independence Exercise ( PLIE ) function quality life old Veterans live community dementia . Dementia devastate condition affect nearly 1 10 old Veterans ( ~1 million individual ) . Current dementia medication minimal impact function quality life stop slow disease course ; however , grow evidence behavioral intervention exercise variety beneficial effect individual dementia . PLIE develop base recent discovery neuroscience experimental psychology find , although explicit memory ( ability consciously recall new information ) impair individual dementia , implicit memory ( unconscious learn typically occurs repeat exposure ) relatively preserve . Therefore , PLIE focus train procedural memory ( unconscious learning procedure ) build strength capacity perform movement need daily function ( e.g. , transition safely sit stand ) . In addition , maximize benefit train , PLIE integrate element Eastern Western exercise modality develop mindful body awareness enhance social connection . The investigator recently complete pilot study PLIE program adult day center San Francisco , CA , find associate clinically meaningful improvement cognitive function , physical performance quality life well reduce caregiver burden compare usual care facility . The current study enable investigator build pilot study result perform full-scale RCT adult day center Northern California . Most VA Medical Centers currently contract community-based organization provide adult day care eligible Veterans dementia . Therefore , sit current study adult day center current contract local VA medical center . Within center , study participant randomly assign receive PLIE intervention program ( 1 hour , 2-3 days/week , 4 month ) Usual Care ( UC ) control ( standard center activity , 1 hour , 2-3 days/week , 4 month ) ( N=120 , 60/group ) use waitlist design . The co-primary outcome 4-month change physical function ( Short Physical Performance Battery , SPPB ) , cognitive function ( Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale , ADAS-cog ) quality life ( Quality Life Alzheimer 's Disease , QOL-AD ) . Changes caregiver feeling ( Caregiver Burden Inventory , CBI ; Positive Aspects Caregiving , PAC ) , fear fall ( Falls Efficacy Scale , FES ) , independence ( Disability Assessment Dementia , DAD ) dementia-related behavior ( Neuropsychiatric Inventory , NPI ) examine secondary outcome . To account waitlist design , outcome assess baseline , 4 month 8 month . The propose project address critically important Veterans ' health problem relate optimize functional status quality life old Veterans dementia . It directly responsive Request Applications ( RFA ) RX-14-011 ( RR &amp; D Merit Review Award Research Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis , Parkinson 's Disease Alzheimer 's Disease ) , identify `` pioneer new innovative rehabilitation methodology restore function improve quality life Veterans live [ ] neurodegenerative disease '' `` major focus . '' Many patient caregiver currently feel little do help individual dementia maintain function quality life . The current study utilize rigorous research method test efficacy innovative promising new program old adult dementia . If program successful , investigator work VA community-based organization implement PLIE broadly .</detailed_description>
