	<brief_summary>A Clinical Trial Demonstrate Comparability Two Iron Sucrose Injection Solutions Iron Sucrose Azad Azad Pharma AG Venofer® Vifor Pharma AG . The Hypothesis That Both Iron Sucrose Injection Solutions Reveal Same Active Substance Availability Blood Circuit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study With Pharmacokinetic Endpoints , Comparing Single Dose Iron Sucrose Azad Injection Azad Pharma Corporation ( AG ) , With Single Dose Venofer® Injection Vifor Corporation ( AG ) Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single dose 100mg Iron Sucrose Azad ( 5 mL single dose vial , mL contain 20 mg/mL elemental iron iron sucrose water injection ) Azad Pharma AG single dose 100mg Venofer® ( 5 mL single dose vial , iron sucrose injection , United States Pharmacopeia ( USP ) , 20 mg/mL ) administer healthy adult volunteer crossover-design . The assignment either test reference product crossover design base randomization schedule . A wash-out period least 5 half-lives iron sucrose calculate crossover design account overall study duration least 10 day ( max 19 day ) volunteer . Overall study participant attend clinical site 5 active study day . The study follow recommend format outline 2013 European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) , i.e . single-dose primary variable AUC Cmax baseline correct total- transferrin-bound serum iron . In addition baseline non-corrected value analyse due know variability baseline iron level ( intra- inter-individual ) . The assays total- transferrin-bound serum iron validate , order ensure dependable readout recommend EMA .</detailed_description>
