	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Withdrawal Effects Following Dosing Oxycodone/Naltrexone Methadone-Maintained Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 34 methadone-maintained opioid-dependent subject enrol study . All subject admit clinical study unit ( CSU ; Visit 2 ) 15-day ( 14 overnight stay ) inpatient Treatment Phase visit . Subjects first undergo 3-day methadone stabilization period ( Days 1 3 ) subject ' methadone administration time gradually shift time dose use throughout Treatment Phase ( approximately 8 daily ) . Following methadone dosing-time stabilization period , subject begin 2-day oxycodone placebo administration period . On Day 4 Day 5 , subject receive total 3 oxycodone placebo dos , separate 6 hour , start approximately one hour follow methadone dose administration . Placebo administer single-blind manner . Starting Day 6 , subject randomize 2:1 ( Oxycodone/Naltrexone Oxycodone ) fashion receive one follow treatment double-blinded manner : - Oxycodone/Naltrexone , multiple oral daily dose 5 day - Oxycodone , multiple oral daily dose 5 day Subjects receive one above-listed treatment three time daily , begin approximately 1 hour follow methadone dose every 6 hour 3 dos administer . Subjects dose manner 5 consecutive day ( Days 6 10 ) . All subject remain confined CSU 4 day first three dos study drug administer Day 10 safety/washout period , continue assess monitor withdrawal effect . Subjects discharge approximately 96 hour first dose study drug ( oxycodone/naltrexone oxycodone ) administer morning Day 10 , medically acceptable accord investigator designee . All subject receive daily phone call Follow-up Phase subject ask presence withdrawal symptom adverse event ( AEs ) . On Days 4 9 , safety , withdrawal , pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic assessment perform 13 hour first three daily study drug dos administer . Following Day 10 study drug administration , assessment complete 96 hour first three daily study drug dos administer morning Day 10 . The Follow-up Phase conduct approximately 10 14 day last drug administration Day 10 early withdrawal study include standard safety assessment .</detailed_description>
