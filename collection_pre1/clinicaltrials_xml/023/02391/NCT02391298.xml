	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) think involve chronic , autoimmune inflammatory process one 's immune system attack myelin sheath surround axon central nervous system . MS associate many symptom decrease one 's quality life include pain , spasticity , fatigue , bowel bladder problem , dizziness , cognitive difficulty , depression . There currently cure MS . Decreased level dopamine ( DA ) measure cerebrospinal fluid primary progressive type MS . In individual relapsing- remit type MS , dopamine level show negative correlation disease severity dopamine level decrease , disease severity increase . Additionally , many symptom MS relate dopaminergic dysfunction and/or abnormality dopamine rich brain area . Dopamine level show increase via active meditation PET image long term meditators . Other study also link dopamine release meditation peripheral nervous system ( via measure DA metabolite blood plasma level ) . It clear whether brief meditation train naive participant may similar effect . Whether meditation could enhance dopamine level patient MS meditation na√Øve individual study . Both dopamine mindfulness training link improved attention emotion regulation . Research also indicate attentional failure infrequent use emotion regulation strategy predict poor quality life patient MS . Thus , sufficient evidence suggest meditation enhance attention , emotion regulation , quality life individual MS dopamine may neurochemical mechanism change . This study open trial pilot design multiple assessment measure mindfulness , dopamine , inhibition , emotion regulation . The primary goal current study evaluate efficacy internet base mindfulness program individual MS . The investigator hypothesize individual MS show increased level mindfulness improve emotion regulation cognitive inhibition skill course . In addition , The investigator hypothesize contrast sensitivity ( proxy measure retinal dopamine level ) increase course . A secondary goal study examine potential cognitive neurochemical mechanism mindfulness relation emotion regulation . Specifically , investigator propose examine whether dopamine cognitive inhibition mediate relationship mindfulness improve emotion regulation .</detailed_description>
