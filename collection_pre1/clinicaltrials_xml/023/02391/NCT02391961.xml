	<brief_summary>Primary fatigue represent major cause disability patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , report 90 % case . Fatigue interfere everyday functioning , unfortunately , little known mechanism . The investigator propose characteristic eye movement abnormality ( internuclear ophthalmoparesis , INO ) , commonly encounter MS , simple model primary motor fatigue . The investigator describe worsen ocular performance MS patient INO follow visual task ( ocular motor fatigue ) , likely due decrease neural conduction along brain pathway injure MS . This mechanism could represent major component MS-related primary motor fatigue . Relevant Veterans ' care , INO significant cause visual disability , especially complicate ocular fatigue , limit daily activity read driving . The investigator propose medical treatment improve ocular performance/fatigue INO , reduce visual disability improve quality life Veterans MS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project focus fatigue , extremely common yet poorly understood complaint patient affect multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Primary fatigue , fatigue secondary MS-associated symptom ( e.g. , sleep disorder depression ) , distinct clinical entity cause severe disability patient . As fatigue limit everyday activity interfere exercise-based rehabilitation , understand mechanism crucial improve function quality life Veterans MS. Primary fatigue divide two broad category , mental ( cognitive ) physical ( motor ) fatigue , latter focus proposal . Evidence suggest primary motor fatigue originates within central nervous system ( CNS ) , although several factor invoke ( e.g. , demyelination , axonal loss , inflammation ) , neurophysiological model explain underlying mechanism still lack . First , project , investigator propose characteristic eye movement abnormality , internuclear ophthalmoparesis ( INO ) , simple accessible model primary motor fatigue MS. INO disorder binocular coordination ( conjugacy ) , fast eye movement ( saccade ) adduct eye ( i.e. , eye move towards nose ) slow horizontal gaze shift , due demyelination specific CNS pathway ( medial longitudinal fasciculus , MLF ) . Preliminary result small MS group patient show patient INO exhibit change ocular conjugacy ( i.e. , ocular motor fatigue ) 10-minute saccadic fatigue test , normal subject . The investigator hypothesize ocular motor fatigue representative major component primary motor fatigue MS , likely reflect deterioration neural conduction fidelity along demyelinated MLF axon . The investigator aim show ocular motor fatigue occur large MS population INO measuring change binocular conjugacy eye movement recording use two main measure : 1 ) abducting/adducting eye ratio saccadic peak velocity ( pulse size ratio ) ; 2 ) time difference occurrence peak acceleration adduct vs. abduct eye ( pulse time delay ) , 10-minute fatigue test . The investigator determine whether ocular motor fatigue associate symptomatic subjective fatigue assess standard fatigue questionnaire . Second , The investigator intend test efficacy dalfampridine , potassium channel blocker enhance neural conduction along demyelinated axon , MS patient INO without associate ocular motor fatigue . Visual dysfunction MS patient INO major cause disability severely limited daily activity drive suffer disability develop ocular motor fatigue sustain visual task ( e.g. , read ) . However , medical therapy available INO/ocular motor fatigue . Preliminary result document improve binocular conjugacy three MS patient take dalfampridine gait impairment ( FDA-approved indication medication ) . These data also show improvement ocular motor fatigue dalfampridine one patient . The investigator hypothesize dalfampridine improves visual performance MS patient INO counteract ocular motor fatigue , turn , diminish visual disability improve quality life . Thus , investigator conduct randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , crossover trial dalfampridine ( 10mg twice day ) 10 week duration . Before treatment , investigator assess change binocular conjugacy eye movement measure , well change clinical measure , read acuity speed , saccades performance , gait performance , symptomatic fatigue , visual disability quality life . investigator determine whether improvement visual performance positive effect overall disability quality life MS patient INO . The investigator also determine whether association response eye movement gait performance dalfampridine .</detailed_description>
