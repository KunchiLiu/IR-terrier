	<brief_summary>To assess potential clinical utility measure pelvic floor muscle tone childbirth vaginal dynamometry , investigator study 50 consecutive consent first attendee Jessop Wing perineal trauma clinic . In addition clinical imaging assessment routinely offer woman clinic , investigator measure active passive pelvic floor muscle tone use Auckland vaginal elastometer . The investigator also assess structural pelvic floor muscle damage ( PFMD ) subset 10 woman ( 5 symptomatic 5 asymptomatic ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MR ) scan pelvic hiatus . The investigator determine predictive capacity vaginal elastometry symptom pelvic floor damage , finding endoanal sonography , MR scan pelvic floor hiatus . The investigator determine vaginal elastometry prove objective accurate frontline assessment tool management PFMD follow childbirth . Our observation generate vital data power design large clinical trial evaluate potential use vaginal elastometer first line assessment tool PFMD postnatal period . Data also inform design personalise model predict manage pelvic floor muscle damage childbirth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In recent year , vaginal dynamometry ( VD ) use elastometer emerge potential tool functional evaluation pelvic floor musculature , early report suggest accurately measure discriminates pelvic floor muscle stiffness woman different parity , fitness level clinical situation include evaluation stress urinary incontinence ( UI ) [ 11-14 ] . With emerge promise report confirm accuracy dynamometer assess PFM strength various woman group investigate stress UI , portable dynamometer recently develop collaborator Auckland Bioengineering Institute ( ABI ) , lead Professor Poul Nielsen [ 15 ] . The device several advantage design : ( 1 ) It hand-held , portable ; ( 2 ) It design operated medical professional ; ( 3 ) It measure coronal well anteroposterior orientation ; ( 4 ) Data acquisition high frequency ( 100Hz ) automate , ( 5 ) Parameters adjustable require protocol . The device consist hand-piece comprise two aluminium arm , detachable acetyl plastic speculum end , actuate via load cell . The tip speculum wider neck order focus measurement level puborectalis portion Levator Ani ( LA ) muscle group reduce contribution perineal muscle . The hand-piece connect control box data acquisition device communicate computer via USB connection . The device measure passive force displacement ( i.e . speculum separation ) , display data graph . The preliminary test portable prototype conduct Auckland find device highly acceptable , consistent repeatable [ 15 ] . A recent study 47 antenatal patient Auckland show 100 % positive feedback device use regular test antenatal unit ( internal communication ) . Indicative approval discuss agree Department Clinical Engineering , subject satisfactory safety check schedule March 2014 , device highly likely meet safety regulatory standard medical device use patient National Health Service ( NHS ) . The device arrive Sheffield successfully undergone safety check Clinical Engineering Department Royal Hallamshire Hospital ( certificate attach ) . The investigator therefore envisage pilot study carry use device Jessop Wing ( JW ) twice-monthly perineal trauma clinic . The clinical study set generate , first time United Kingdom , sensitivity specificity data vaginal dynamometry detect functional defect PFM tone post-delivery . The Investigators accrue data regard correlation finding clinically detect perineal muscle damage well radiologically-confirmed LA hiatus defect . The success pilot study provide strong support investigator seek fund large multicentre study clinical application VD screen management PFMD prevent long term pelvic floor laxity , stress UI , pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) .There paucity report regard application clinical care manage PFMD childbirth . The investigator prospectively recruit 50 consecutive woman attend perineal trauma clinic ( PTC ) Jessop Wing Royal Hallamshire Hospital Sheffield standard clinical care VD . Given limitation fund time duration experiment , investigator adopt pragmatic approach recruit study consecutive consent woman 6-month period .</detailed_description>
