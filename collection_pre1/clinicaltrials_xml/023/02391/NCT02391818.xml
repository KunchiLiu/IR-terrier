	<brief_summary>The purpose study quantify balance impairment taxane chemotherapy . Disability due balance impairment cause chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy ( CIPN ) cause fall , injury , decline independence . This result poor treatment outcome great morbidity mortality , inability complete treatment protocol , self-limitation activity , diminish quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Taxane Chemotherapy Balance Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study describe balance deficit prior initiation taxane therapy duration treatment compare balance cohort woman without taxane therapy . To knowledge , study like do yet necessary next step order evaluate whether balance deficit resolve independent treatment balance deficit require targeted therapy . Other study evaluate balance taxane patient , use cross-sectional study design limit observation one point time . Further , evaluation limit measurement balance use self-report questionnaire , performance measurement functional balance . Previous study condition show poor concordance self-report questionnaire performance measure . Therefore , propose longitudinal study improve current knowledge balance deficit taxane therapy quantify impact taxane chemotherapy balance treatment use standardize validated self-report performance functional balance assessment tool . The result study improve treatment balance deficit woman taxane therapy identifying type , onset , duration , severity deficit within balance system . From finding , target intervention , require , could develop . In addition , establish feasibility utility quantify balance impairment necessary development large study assess effect rehabilitation intervention functional disability due CIPN . Such study would worthy influence change clinical practice minimize disability balance dysfunction , , chemotherapy , thus maximize function quality life cancer treatment .</detailed_description>
