	<detailed_description>Molecular imaging use distinguish recurrent tumor post-treatment change use positron emission tomography ( PET ) well technique . The best-studied PET radiotracer application [ 18F ] -fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) . Normal brain matter FDG-avid , make difficult identify lesion addition , inflammation associate radiation injury show FDG avid . In light , variation standard FDG protocol propose order increase overall accuracy , include dual time point imaging ( DTPI ) , consist inject patient standard radiotracer acquire two set image several hour apart , typically normal initial image addition delay acquisition set . There good reason suspect DTPI FDG-PET would useful technique characterize lesion brain . It 's show FDG uptake normal brain parenchyma initially increase decrease time , tumor uptake typically increase plateau . This pattern increase decrease FDG activity also see inflammatory tissue . The difference FDG uptake different time allow good distinction malignant benign tissue .</detailed_description>
