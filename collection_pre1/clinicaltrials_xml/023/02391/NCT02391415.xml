	<brief_summary>Goal Serum Institute India Limited ( SIIL ) development recombinant urease C-deficient listeriolysin express BCG vaccine strain ( VPM1002 ) safe , well tolerate efficacious vaccine tuberculosis ( TB ) resident endemic area person risk non-endemic area . The new vaccine least potent current strain safer BCG . The precede phase-IIa trial first investigation VPM1002 newborn infant high burden set South Africa . The vaccination HIV-unexposed infant VPM1002 indicate safety , tolerability immunogenicity sufficient proceed HIV-exposed infant . The current study multiple site trial South Africa evaluate safety immunogenicity HIV-unexposed -exposed newborn infant .</brief_summary>
