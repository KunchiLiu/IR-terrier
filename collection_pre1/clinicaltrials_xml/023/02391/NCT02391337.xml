	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation common heart rhythm disturbance , cause important discomfort patient , high risk stroke , frequent hospital admission two-fold increase death . The number patient condition expect double next 20 year . Medications control heart-rate use majority patient , although choice agent often guide local preference rather evidence control trial . Despite fact patient atrial fibrillation high rate cardiac condition heart failure , clinician insufficient evidence personalise use different therapy . This feasibility study allow u develop range method characterise patient accord pump relax function heart , burden symptom identify new blood marker . In way , investigator hope improve clinical practice guideline , allow doctor prescribe appropriate treatment right patient . The research focus around randomise trial two medication strategy , provide much-needed data comparison digoxin beta-blockers ( two commonly-used drug patient atrial fibrillation ) . It also allow u identify best way record patient-reported quality life develop robust technique determine heart function use non-invasive imaging , facilitate conduct large-scale clinical trial . The key objective research programme define optimal medication patient atrial fibrillation identify valid , reproducible cost-effective method examine patient . The ultimate aim project improve clinical outcome atrial fibrillation , benefit patient , National Health Service global community .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rate Control Therapy Evaluation Permanent Atrial Fibrillation ( RATE-AF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) increasingly common cardiac condition lead substantial burden quality-of-life ( QoL ) , increase risk cardiovascular event , hospitalisation death , significant healthcare cost NHS . In addition anti-coagulation consideration rhythm control therapy , patient AF need pharmacological control heart rate . This aspect care receive stringent investigation , treatment guideline base small crossover study observational data rather robust control trial . Beta-blocker monotherapy remain first-line option current NICE AF guideline consultation document , digoxin sedentary patient , although recommendation base 'very low-quality evidence ' . The benefit different rate-control therapy symptoms intermediate outcome ( left-ventricular ejection fraction [ LVEF ] diastolic function ) unknown , effect clinical event hospitalisation . This situation unacceptable light potential benefit risk different rate-control option AF . It also limit ability personalise treatment accord patient characteristic . The RAte control Therapy Evaluation permanent Atrial Fibrillation ( RATE-AF ) trial informed number in-depth systematic review management clinical outcome AF patient . Taken together , information provide sound basis plan major randomise control trial ( RCT ) . However trials rate-control AF typically small uncontrolled , information need design trial ass clinical outcome . The RATE-AF trial allow u define appropriate primary secondary outcome measure standard deviation contemporary population patient permanent AF . This information allow u estimate sample size , determination recruitment , retention adherence policy , ascertain best method obtain adverse event data reliable economic cost large trial assess cardiovascular outcome hospitalization . The RATE-AF trial also large RCT kind , allow u compare effect beta-blockers digoxin QoL initial rate-control therapy patient permanent AF . The long-term aim research answer key question initiate therapy , stratify relevant patient characteristic systolic diastolic cardiac function , baseline symptom concurrent medication . The research also define patho-physiological mechanism underlie AF-related symptom , left-ventricular function association adverse clinical outcome , identify clinical marker response different rate control therapy .</detailed_description>
