	<brief_summary>A first-in-human evaluation SYN004 , monoclonal antibody bind EGF receptor cancer cell . Cetuximab , market antibody , show effective inhibiting growth cancer cell thereby prolong life patient receive . SYN004 closely related monoclonal antibody also bind EGF receptor way . SYN004 might also inhibit cancer cell prolong life engineer avoid hypersensitivity reaction know provoked cetuximab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : In open-label , dose escalation study , subject receive single IV load dose SYN004 Day 1 first treatment week , follow 7 fixed weekly dos SYN004 . Subjects assign load fix dos dose group . Each dose group comprise 3 subject may expand 6 subject . Subjects enter dose group order enrol . There intra-subject dose adjustment . Only 1 subject cohort may receive load dose SYN004 give day ; least 1 day must elapse next subject cohort receive load dose . Study SYN004-001 Dose Matrix . Three initial subject enrol follow additional three specify protocol . Dose level specify . Group 1 : Loading dose : 100 mg/m2 ; Weekly Dose : 62.5 mg/m2 . Group 2 : Loading dose : 200 mg/m2 ; Weekly Dose : 125 mg/m2 . Group 3 : Loading dose : 400 mg/m2 ; Weekly Dose : 250 mg/m2 . After dose IV SYN004 , subject observe clinic 12 hour . After load dose , subject undergo safety evaluation Days 2 , 3 5 . Safety evaluation also perform Day 1 ( pre-treatment ) Day 3 fix dose treatment week . Dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) define Grade ≥3 AE assess investigator Medical Monitor , agreement Safety Review Board ( SRB ) , related SYN004 . Subjects DLTs withdrawn treatment . If 2 subject dose group experience DLTs , one subject dose group experience Grade ≥3 infusion reaction , subject dose group withdrawn treatment . Subjects dose group consider evaluable dose escalation decision receive least 4 dos SYN004 , discontinue SYN004 DLT . Subjects withdraw terminate per protocol receive 4 dos SYN004 replace . For subject receive least 4 dos SYN004 , End Study CT scan RECIST ( version 1.1 ) evaluation perform six ( 6 ) day follow final SYN004 treatment . There 28-day safety monitoring period follow final dose SYN004 subject study . All subject attend End-of-Study Visit 28 day final dose SYN004 . Subjects complete Cycles 1 2 , evidence improvement per RECIST 1.1 ( i.e. , finding complete partial response per RECIST 1.1 ) meet eligibility criterion offer 3 additional treatment cycle ( i.e. , 12 additional weekly dos ) SYN004 SYN004-001 Extension Study . During Extension Study , subject receive fix dose SYN004 receive Cycles 1 2 . Dose escalation proceed accord standard 3+3 study design .</detailed_description>
