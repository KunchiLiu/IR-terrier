	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study assess safety profile RCS-01 injection compare placebo injection . This study also measure impact injection skin marker related age evaluation gene expression profile . 30 participant select study base health status , current/past medication , ability adhere protocol-related requirement . At first visit provide informed consent , participant evaluate study inclusion/exclusion criterion provide blood sample screen assessment ( include virology ) . If suitable study participation , participant provide biopsy scalp RCS-01 prepare four treatment evaluation site identify buttock , two side . Study participant randomize one two treatment subgroup . Participants RCS-01 Subgroup ( n=24 ) receive injection RCS-01 placebo 'sham ' injection ( needle penetration without injection liquid ) . Participants Placebo Subgroup ( n= 6 ) randomize receive injection placebo sham injection . Baseline evaluations subject ' overall health skin condition treatment sit buttock perform receipt injection Day 0 .
