	<brief_summary>Cancer incidence increase age likelihood elderly suffering cancer 1:3 . Although many clinical trial include elderly patient , result subgroup patient available . Since specific recommendation treatment elderly patient pancreatic cancer , treatment gemcitabine alone treatment choice patient . Single-agent gemcitabine current standard care , addition cytotoxic target agent gemcitabine almost invariably provided significant survival improvement . Results obtain recently MPACT phase III clinical trial patient pancreatic cancer treat nab-paclitaxel combined gemcitabine show improvement overall survival , due clinical trial include patient 27 88 year , consider necessary conduct specific study patient 70 year . The aim study investigate whether clinical benefit nab-paclitaxel associate gemcitabine extend elderly patient pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
