	<brief_summary>Robot assist gait training see promise intervention improve walk ability child cerebral palsy , research support effectiveness compare best practice physical therapy lacking . This research consist randomize control trial ( RCT ) qualitative descriptive study link RCT . The goal RCT compare : 1 ) walk train program Lokomat速 robotic device ( LOK ) , 2 ) functional physical therapy program ( fPT ) include activity enhance balance/co-ordination/endurance advanced motor skill conduct 'real ground ' , 3 ) combine Lokomat速 + functional physical therapy ( LOK+fPT ) program , 4 ) regular maintenance therapy condition ( CONT ) ambulatory child youth CP ( age 5- 18 year ) . The three intervention program consist sixteen 50-minute session give twice weekly 8 10 week . The primary objective RCT compare four group respect walking-related motor skill measure Gross Motor Function Measure . The secondary objective compare intervention 's impact walking ability , individualized goal , fitness , balance , physical activity level , child 's belief ability physical activity , participation quality life . The investigator also evaluate extent carryover progress 3 month intervention . The qualitative part study consist interview child parent finish study intervention . The information interview assist u interpretation outcome result ( area impact amount change ) RCT . In particular , interview 1 ) provide insight experience trial intervention , 2 ) identify mobility-related outcome important family factor influence preference , 3 ) explain family value , experience contextual factor influence participation study . This research provide information need allow clinician family make informed choice Lokomat therapy physical therapy option relation child 's functional goal ability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Robotic Gait Training Physical Therapy Children Youth With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) common cause childhood physical disability , affect 2.0-2.5 1000 child . CP represent group disorder movement posture impairment ( e.g. , muscle weakness , decrease selective motor control , alteration muscle tone , impairment postural control ) collectively affect functional mobility . About 65 % children/youth CP use minimal assistive device ( leg brace , walker , and/or wheelchair ) walk ( i.e. , Gross Motor Function Classification System ( GMFCS ) Levels I II ) child GMFCS Levels III - V require vary degree brace , walker walk device , wheelchair , assistance others mobility . Robotic Assisted Gait training device increasingly use child CP improve gait relate motor skill . The Lokomat速 ( LOK ) commercially available robot assist gait training system use robotics simulate walking . It facilitate inter-limb co-ordination gait cycle time provide variable degree body weight support guidance . This study represent first adequately power RCT evaluate effectiveness robot assist gait training child CP . The qualitative aspect give contextual information assist interpretation RCT provide valuable information family ' experience intervention . The research question study : ) What comparative effectiveness robot assist gait training ( LOK ) fPT program improving gait relate motor skill ambulatory child youth CP ? ii ) Does combine LOK fPT result great improvement gait relate motor skill ambulatory child youth CP robot assist gait training fPT alone ? iii ) What family ' experience trial participation implication interpretation quantitative result use robot assist gait train fPT clinical setting ? Methods This trial concurrent , mixed method study . Specifically , quantitative arm multi-centre RCT four group ( 22 factorial design , i.e. , LOK absent/present , fPT absent/present ) two period post-intervention assessment ( immediate 3 month later ) . The RCT link interpretive descriptive qualitative study arm . The three study site Holland Bloorview ( Toronto , Ontario , Canada ) , Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital ( Edmonton , Alberta , Canada ) Rehabilitation Institute Chicago ( Chicago , IL ) . Participants - Children age 5-18 CP , GMFCS level II III . Inclusion/Exclusion criterion include protocol document section . Randomization - Following baseline assessment , participant randomly allocate one four group use computer-generated random sequence . Blinding Physical therapist assessor data analyst blind group allocation . TreatmentThere three intervention group : 1 ) LOK , 2 ) LOK + fPT , 3 ) fPT , 4 ) one maintenance therapy control ( CONT ) arm . All three intervention group receive two 50-minute session per week , conduct 8 -10 week . Children four group continue participate 'maintenance therapy ' . Each child assign treatment team two train PTs share responsibility 8 10 week intervention phase . LOK - two 50-minute session Lokomat速 per week . The study manualized LOK walk protocol provide method progressing/tracking include 5-minute ground walk session LOK facilitate transfer motor learn Lokomat usual walking device . fPT Participants Two 50-minute session per week . The manualized motor-learning base protocol form basis intervention . Its focus balance multi-plane gait-based motor skill . LOK + fPT group protocol : Participants alternate LOK one fPT session per week duration 8 10 week intervention phase . Monitoring co-interventionsMaintenance therapy home stretch strengthen routine continue 4 group throughout study therapy questionable efficacy , likely equally use across four group common PT recommendation . Outcomes - All study outcome measure pre-/post-intervention ( &lt; 10 day pre-intervention post-completion ) , 3m follow-up ( +/- 10 day window ) train physical therapist . Data enter REDCap . Primary Outcome - The primary outcome measure Gross Motor Function Measure-66 ( GMFM-66 Dimensions D ( Stand ) E ( Walk/Run/Jump ) . Secondary Outcomes - Secondary outcome measure walk capacity ( 6 minute walk test ) fitness ( adapted shuttle run test ) , balance ( Pediatric Berg Balance Scale , Quality Function Measure ( FM ) , Activities Balance Confidence Scale ) , functional ability ( PEDI-CAT ) , physical activity level ( accelerometry ) , participation ( Participation Environment Measure Children Youth ) , physical activity self-efficacy ( Self-Efficacy Physical Activity ) , individualized goal attainment ( Canadian Occupational Performance Measure ( COPM ) Goal Attainment Scaling ) , quality life ( KidScreen Students ' Life Satisfaction Scale ) . Statistical Analysis - Data described ( e.g. , mean , standard deviation , frequency ) intervention group stratification variable . Mixed-effects multiple linear regression model develop outcome centre random effect , centre intervention interaction ( assess centre effect ) , important variable ( e.g. , age GMFCS level ) covariates . All main analysis base intent-to-treat secondary analysis &gt; 80 % adherence intervention . Qualitative Component The three objective concurrent qualitative component explicate : 1 . Child parent experience trial intervention value previous experience shape perception . 2 . The mobility relate outcomes important family factor influence view . 3 . Child family value , experience contextual factor influence participation trial , include follow-up period . Design Interpretive description Sample selection- The investigator invite subset child-parent dyad active intervention RCT . In addition , parent child eligible decline participate RCT invite participate qualitative component address objective # 3 . The estimated sample size ( i.e. , 6 child/parent dyad plus 3 parent site ) . Data Collection - Parents participate 45-60 minute semi-structured , individual interview conduct one member research team . Participating parent child RCT interview 2 point within trial : ) completion COPM prior receive intervention , ii ) within one month intervention completion . Children RCT participate individual interview end LOK/fPT intervention . A customizable `` tool box '' age-appropriate child-friendly technique include photographs comic captioning , vignette , sentence starter use 30-45 minute semi-structured interview child without parent present . Data Management Analysis Interviews digitally audio-recorded , transcribe verbatim professional transcriptionist , de-identified import NVivo data management . Two researcher collaboratively identify general cod category . The researcher meet establish consensus coding .</detailed_description>
