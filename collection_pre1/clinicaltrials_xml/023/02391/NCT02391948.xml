	<brief_title>On Track : Monitoring Development Children With Cerebral Palsy Gross Motor Delay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trained therapist assessor measure primary secondary impairment ( i.e. , balance , range motion limitation , strength ) 5 occasion ( 6-months apart 2 year ) . Parents complete questionnaire track change child 's endurance , health condition , participation self-care recreation activity , data collection point . The researcher use 5 data collection point develop reference percentile present data therapist assist family determine child CP develop expect , well expect , poorly expect , depend functional ability level . The researcher create longitudinal developmental curve impairment , health condition , participation variable estimate average pattern change , important individual variation pattern change child , degree consistency time within child . Establishment longitudinal developmental curve provide easily understood useful tool family service provider discuss question well child relationship child CP similar functional ability level . The researcher utilize service data collect parent child 's progress longitudinal developmental curve develop recommendation rehabilitation service provision child CP across functional ability level . Having information assist collaborative decision-making among family member service provider efficiently utilize rehabilitation service meet family ' goal . An additional sub-study collect direct physical activity measurement sub-set child large study . These data examine relationship measure endurance participation .</detailed_description>
