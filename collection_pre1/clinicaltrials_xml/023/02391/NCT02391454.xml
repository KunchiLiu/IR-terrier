	<brief_summary>Rationale : Cancer treatment increasingly successful , result rise number cancer survivor . A substantial number survivor may experience long-term late side effect cancer treatment . In addition , evidence accumulate active lifestyle positively influence cancer treatment outcome change recurrence rate disease . Therefore , physical activity ( PA ) program urgently need incorporated current treatment regimen . It note though cancer patient survivor experience difficulty remain physically active . A 'smartphone application ' ( app ) may accessible way counteract problem . The app 'RunKeeper ' , found Mr. Jason Jacobs , 2008 , FitnessKeeper Inc. ( RunKeeper ) free , widely spread well-known app self-monitoring PA . Convenient feature RunKeeper self-monitoring PA GPS stopwatch , record progress , goal setting , personal record . In study investigator aim determine RunKeeper app use improve PA self-monitoring empower PA cancer treatment comparison usual care 12-week follow-up . Objective : The primary objective identify improvement PA measure PASE questionnaire use RunKeeper app comparison usual care 12 week cancer treatment . The investigator hypothesize RunKeeper app might assist stimulate improve PA behavior . Secondary objective explore usability RunKeeper app . Study design : The present study single-centre prospective two-armed randomize control feasibility study . Study population : Adult patient diagnose cancer currently treat surveillance department Medical Oncology UMCG . Intervention : Patients give informed consent randomize one two study arm ; 'Group A ' , usual care ( N=15 ) 'Group B ' , usual care + RunKeeper app ( N=15 ) . Directly randomization , Group B send brief user 's manual RunKeeper request install RunKeeper app . Group B use RunKeeper app 12 week self-monitor PA. Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary endpoint calculate effect-size RunKeeper app use 12 week PA compare usual care measure Physical Activity Scale Elderly ( PASE ) questionnaire . The investigator hypothesize RunKeeper app might assist stimulate improve PA behavior .</brief_summary>
