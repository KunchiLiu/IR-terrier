	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : The Southern European Atlantic Diet ( SEAD ) traditional diet Northern Portugal Galicia , region northwest Spain . The SEAD associate low risk non-fatal acute myocardial infarction . Possible mechanisms association may relate low concentration marker inflammation reduce triglyceride , insulin , insulin resistance , systolic blood pressure . Aim : To evaluate effect Atlantic Diet ) lipid profile , ii ) marker inflammation , iii ) anthropometric index population-based study METHODS : This non-pharmacological clinical trial study perform family-oriented basis . 250 family ( ~ 750 child adult , old 3 year ) select participate study randomize Atlantic Diet ( AD ) ( n=125 family ) control ( n=125 family ) group . The AD group participate diet program 1 day month 3 month 120-minute diet session freely receive AD food , characterize high intake vegetable , cheese , olive oil , mussel wine consumption meal . Control group subject participate regular diet activity period receive additional food . Exclusion criterion alcoholism , lipid treatment , dementia , terminal disease . Weight , BMI , waist circumference ( WC ) , skin fold , nutrient intake 3-day recall , food frequency questionnaire , physical activity , blood pressure , metabolic function ( fast blood glucose , HBA1c , insulin resistance lipid profile ) , inflammation marker ( c-reactive protein , interleukin 6 tumor necrosis factor-alpha ) measure baseline , 3 6 month . Mixed effect model perform assess significance change cardiometabolic parameter . The primary end point change lipid profile compare baseline control group arm end Month 6 . The secondary exploratory end point change anthropometric index inflammation marker Month 6 .</brief_summary>
