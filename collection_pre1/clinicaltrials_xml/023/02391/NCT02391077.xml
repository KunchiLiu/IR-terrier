	<detailed_description>The PrePex device accept World Health Organization ( WHO ) list prequalified male circumcision ( MC ) device list 31 May 2013 . PrePex become first medical device adult male circumcision receive WHO prequalification alternative conventional surgical circumcision method already recognize WHO . Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision ( VMMC ) one-time , low cost intervention show reduce men 's risk HIV infection approximately 70 percent .

Due foreskin necrotic state , longer possible men fully retract skin properly clean sulcus inner foreskin , sub-preputial space normally low oxygen environment facilitate anaerobe growth , follow device placement environment become lead high bacterial load . This suggest report unpleasant odor follow device placement confirm laboratory test do RHSP Uganda swab take inside foreskin prior device removal , result yet publish . There potential bacterial overgrowth foreskin sub-preputial space , therefore would like investigate possible technique reduce potential . This trial aim validate action need minimize probability aerobic anaerobic bacteria overgrowth PrePex introduce , establish safe procedure . The trial encompass different safe know technique , usage anti-bacterial topical ointment , objective evaluate use laboratory test .</detailed_description>
