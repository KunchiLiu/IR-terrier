	<detailed_description>Recent evidence suggest zoledronate , one use bisphosphonates ( BPs ) clinical set prevention treatment bone metastasis cancer patient , may antitumor activity early breast cancer . Notwithstanding conflict data , majority clinical trial show positive effect BPs patient outcome , report improved Disease Free Survival ( DFS ) Overall Survival mostly chemotherapy-naive premenopausal patient 3-year treatment zoledronate well DFS immediate use zoledronate postmenopausal patient receive adjuvant aromatase inhibitor treatment . Moreover , early breast cancer patient treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy combination zoledronic acid show good response compare chemotherapy alone . Even though different explanation propose over-time , exact mechanism action anti-tumor activity BPs still well understood . Basically , BPs mevalonate pathway inhibitor one intrigue hypothesis support anticancer activity rely modulation mevalonate downstream metabolism . Biologically active mevalonate metabolite involve tumour cell proliferation , survival , invasion metastasis . Moreover , evidence select cancer subtypes may present pronounced mevalonate activity , able maintain aggressive phenotype . Indeed , mevalonate pathway deep impact function YAP/TAZ , transcriptional regulator tumour growth . Preclinical evidence , suggest BPs able interfere YAP/TAZ expression , via mevalonate pathway . This study address clinical role BPs triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) patient select level mevalonate pathway regulation , namely p53 expression . This study multicenter single-arm , phase II study primarily aim assess anti-tumor activity pre-operative zoledronate measure effect Ki67 proliferative surrogate biomarker , patient TNBC classify accord p53 expression ( high v low p53 expression ) . An high level p53 define IHC expression ≥30 % , low level define IHC expression &lt; 30 % , previously describe . Patients newly diagnose , untreated , operable TNBC , intend definitive breast surgery suitable pre-operative therapy register use centralized system receive pre-operative , single administration zoledronate ( 4mg i.v . ) , 7 day definitive breast surgery . Ki67 level assess core biopsy tumor sample collect time diagnosis zoledronate treatment time definitive surgery . Primary endpoint study proportion responder patient , define least 30 % reduction Ki67 surgery respect core-biopsy analysis . The secondary objective study investigate effect zoledronate critical genes/proteins relate p53 mevalonate pathway , p53/PIN1 YAP/TAZ , analyze tumor tissue time diagnosis ( core biopsy ) definitive surgery . The safety profile zoledronate evaluate National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE ) scale , version 4.0 occurrence serious adverse reaction . The total number patient require forty . The overall duration project expect 32 month , divide follow : 30 month accrual , follow 2 month follow-up recruitment last patient , aim collect data zoledronate safety tolerability . The primary analysis conduct PP population include patient register , receive dose study treatment underwent definitive breast surgery , major violation eligibility criterion study conduction . Proportion responder patient , define least 30 % reduction Ki67 surgery respect core-biopsy analysis , present point estimate 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CIs ) group . Logistic regression technique use compare group univariate multivariate model adjust ECOG-PS , sex pre- postmenopausal status . The result project may eventually contribute unveil novel anticancer mechanism action BPs new therapeutic option triple negative breast cancer .</detailed_description>
