	<brief_title>Project JAY THA Registration Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As incidence joint disease continue increase , ever grow percentage affect population undergo total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) . This recent upward trend THA procedures appear directly relate prevalence certain health factor . Specifically , long life span , rise obesity rate , increase physical activity level relatively young population example factor may significantly contribute hip degeneration . While strategy weight reduction , lifestyle change , drug therapy may offer temporary relief symptom joint degeneration , THA remain standard care subject experience significant loss quality life due advance hip disease . There increase import hip prosthesis past decade , surgeon choice implant . However , high cost import prostheses become barrier development hip replacement China cause many patient require immediate hip replacement delay miss surgery . The development promotion high-quality domestic joint implant surgical instrument key development joint replacement technique China . The primary objective study demonstrate non-inferiority subject implant Delta PLUS Femoral Head + SL-TWIN Stem compare randomized concurrent control group subject implant BIOLOX forte ball head + SL-PLUS Stem term mean Harris Hip Score ( HHS ) 1 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female subject , age 50 75 year inclusive Chinese ethnicity . Subject present osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , posttraumatic arthritis , avascular necrosis hip joint , developmental dysplasia hip , femoral neck fracture require primary total hip replacement . Subject able give voluntary , write informed consent participate study consent obtain sign date ECapproved consent form . Subject able understand clinical study , cooperate investigational procedure willing return hospital require postoperative followup 12 month . Life expectancy subject 2 year . Bilateral hip disease anticipate need bilateral hip implant study participation ( i.e. , within next 12 month ) . Subject experience prior joint replacement surgery major joint ( hip , knee ) low limb within last 12 month . Subject developmental dysplasia hip CROWE grade 3 4 . Subject know suspected metal sensitivity . Subject know insufficient bone stock result condition cancer , significant osteoporosis metabolic bone disorder , provide adequate support and/or fixation prosthesis . Subject severely obese ( BMI &gt; 35 ) . Subject active infection sepsis ( treat untreated ) . Subject condition may compromise implant stability postoperative recovery ( i.e. , Paget 's Charcot 's disease , vascular insufficiency , muscular atrophy , uncontrolled diabetes , moderate severe renal insufficiency , hip abduction muscle strength less grade IV complete loss , neuromuscular disease ) . Subject emotional neurological condition would affect ability willingness participate study ( e.g . cognitive disorder , mental illness , mental retardation ) . Subject immunosuppressed , autoimmune disorder , immunosuppressive disorder . For example , subject immunosuppressive therapy ( corticosteroid hormone large amount , cytotoxic drug , antilymphocytic serum irradiation large dos ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . Subject know risk lose followup , failure return schedule visit . Subject enrol another investigational drug , biologic , device study last 12 month . Subject woman pregnant lactatingï¼Œor intend become pregnant course study . Known alcohol and/or drug abuse</criteria>
