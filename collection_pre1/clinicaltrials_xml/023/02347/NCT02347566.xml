	<brief_title>Physical Activity Enhancing Programme COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : For logistical purpose , study divide two work package ( WP ) : 1 ) Pilot study DirectLife activity monitor daily routine patient COPD ( WP1 ) , cross-sectional study ; 2 ) Physical activity enhance programme - main project ( WP2 ) , randomize control trial . Both study perform Leith 's Community Treatment Centre ( LCTC ) satellite ( Midlothian Community Hospital ( Bonnyrigg ) &amp; St Johns Hospital ( Livingston ) - Edinburgh ) . Only patient COPD refer pulmonary rehabilitation LCTC satellite recruit study . The standard care treatment ( exercise training ) exactly sit , deliver team physiotherapists.At satellite unit would still direct care approach participant . The recruiting procedure original study . Written sign consent take prior inclusion patient . The study explain protocol procedure may undergo study period sign inform consent . With least 24 hour advance consider patient take part study , send patient information sheet explain project procedure involve . WP1 : This WP aim establish best wear position DirectLife activity monitor 20 patient COPD daily routine home . As DirectLife validate healthy subject , important step understand device work daily routine , best position wear , also feasible use patient COPD . This WP conduct prior begin WP2 participant sign consent form participate study . Twenty COPD patient undertake follow assessment : pulmonary function ( spirometry ) , exercise capacity ( ISWT ESWT ) , quality life ( CRQ ) , dyspnoea sensation ( MRC scale ) physical activity daily life . Patients wear simultaneously three different DirectLife device three different body place ( hip , front pocket neck ) fourth physical activity monitor ( Actigraph GT3x ) recently show valid accurate device measure daily PAL patient COPD . Patients wear four activity monitor ( three DirectLife one Actigraph GT3x ) simultaneously daily routine , period least 10 hours/day evaluation period one week . After monitor period , answer simple questionnaire feasibility use DirectLife day-to-day include question : position ( ) consider best position wear DirectLife , easy put whether use DirectLife interfere daily routine . At end WP able establish best position use DirectLife position use WP2 . If one site favour others monitor position , ask patient wear DirectLife place judge comfortable . If DirectLife provide accurate measurement patient ' physical activity , ask wear device pocket ( position manufacturer state best wear ) . WP2 : This WP aim compare PAEP add pulmonary rehabilitation usual care ( pulmonary rehabilitation alone ) . Sixty-four patient COPD randomize two group : Usual care ( control , [ C ] ) include pulmonary rehabilitation programme use DirectLife daily routine without feedback incentive increase PAL ; usual care + physical activity enhance programme ( PAEP ) ( Study group , [ S ] ) , include pulmonary rehabilitation programme plus PAEP use DirectLife activity monitor set target physical activity level stimulate increase PADL . Both group perform pulmonary rehabilitation programme , compose ( brief ) : resistance training quadriceps femoris , biceps triceps brachii ; aerobic exercise treadmill cycle ergometer 6-10 week . All patient assess PR ( Visit 1 ) , 3 month begin PR ( Visit 2 ) . Patients follow 3 month visit 2 ( Visit 3 ) . Assessment include lung function ( spirometry ) , exercise capacity , peripheral muscle strength , physical activity daily life , quality life , systemic inflammation , anxiety depression , dyspnoea sensation ( see description ) . In addition , patient fill psychological survey three occasion : visit 1 , visit 2 , end study ( visit 3 ) . For follow-up phase , patient group ( S C ) invite attend assessment perform Visit 1 ( exclude spirometry , ISWT blood sample ) , three month visit 2 ( Visit 3 ) ass maintenance effect programme . This additional monitoring period optional . Therefore patient choose whether want keep help u study . For three month period , group wear DirectLife ( without feedback incentive increase physical activity ) monitor PAL period . Over three month follow period , patient receive formal physical activity counseling/intervention , exclude analysis would treatment could influence PAL ( i.e. , pulmonary rehabilitation ) . In group , initial physical activity level ( PALi ) also establish assess PAL DirectLife activity monitor ( DirectLife , Philips , The Netherlands ) throughout whole week . The physical activity data collect DirectLife activity monitor use facilitate behavioural intervention S group , outcome PAL different activity monitor ( Actigraph GT3x ) validate COPD use . The DirectLife activity monitor lightweight portable device wear three different place ( necklace , pocket hip ) provide main variable active time ( minute ) energy expenditure ( calorie ) . DirectLife track body motion triaxial sensor . It also provide feedback patient PAL perform since begin day ; series indicator light Activity Monitor show accumulate activity particular moment day . It also show daily target physical activity level make easy keep track towards goal . The aim study achieve increment 50 % initial PAL end 12 week programme S group . Exercise training programme Both group perform 6-10 week standard exercise training programme use UK , 1-2 time per week . Each training session last 1 hour . As mentioned , exercise programme include cycling ; walking ; strength training quadriceps femoris , biceps , triceps brachii muscle group . The physiotherapist LCTC satellite increase work rate duration exercise programme every week guide pre-determined schedule drive patient 's perception symptom ( measure via Borg dyspnoea fatigue score ) . It important note related increment daily physical activity training PAEP ( set target DirectLife ) , set another physiotherapist Philips website . Statistical Analysis : Results describe mean±SD median [ IQR ] , accord normality data distribution , analyze Shapiro-Wilk test . In WP1 , depend data distribution , comparison among Actigraph GT3x DirectLife ( three position ) perform use one-way ANOVA correspondent Kruskal-Wallis test , Dunn ` post hoc test . To analyze DirectLife validity , correlation PAL device ( week average measure outputs device ) test either Pearson Spearman correlation coefficient , depend data distribution . To assess DirectLife ` agreement criterion method , perform Bland-Altman plot calculate intra-class correlation coefficient ( ICC ) energy expenditure time spend actively . The level significance comparison set p &lt; 0.05 . Data analyze use statistical package SAS version 9.3 ( SAS Institute Inc , Cary , NC , USA ) . For WP2 , result describe mean±SD median [ IQR ] , accord normality data distribution , analyze Shapiro-Wilk test . Effects PAEP group patient receive combine treatment ( PR+PAEP ) assess compare PAL ( Visit 1 ) 3 month begin PR ( Visit 2 ) use paired student t-test ( correspondent test non-normally distributed variable ) . Effects PAEP main outcome ( physical activity level ) assess compare difference ( post-pre PAEP ) physical activity level PAEP Control unpaired student t-test ( correspondent Mann-Whitney test ) . Correlations PADL variable assess either Pearson 's Spearman 's coefficient depend distribution variable . The level significance comparison set p &lt; 0.05 . Data analyze use statistical package SAS version 9.3 ( SAS Institute Inc , Cary , NC , USA ) . Based study Breyer et al . ( 2010 ) explore effect Nordic walk programme physical activity patient COPD show Nordic-walk able increase physical activity level 3 month programme ( movement intensity , 0.4+/-0.14 ) comparison control ( movement intensity , -0.05+/-0.28 ) , comparison S C consider change physical activity level main outcome , alpha 0.05 beta 0.1 , 24 subject require per branch show statistical significant difference 90 % power . Assuming 30 % dropouts plan include 64 subject ( 32 patient per branch , S C ) . To assess effect intervention ( S C ) short term ( three month follow period ) , perform intra-group analysis ( Visit 1 , Visit 2 , Visit 3 ) , use One way ANOVA repeat measure test ( correspondent Friedman ` test non-normally distributed variable ) . Effects PAEP main outcome ( physical activity level ) assess compare difference ( follow - post PAEP , post - pre PAEP ) physical activity level PAEP Control unpaired student t-test ( correspondent Mann-Whitney test ) . Results also describe mean±SD median [ IQR ] , accord normality data distribution , analyze Shapiro-Wilk test . Correlations PADL variable assess either Pearson 's Spearman 's coefficient depend distribution variable . The level significance comparison set p &lt; 0.05 . Data analyze use statistical package SAS version 9.3 ( SAS Institute Inc , Cary , NC , USA ) .</detailed_description>
