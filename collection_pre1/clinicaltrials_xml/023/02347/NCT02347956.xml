	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer one common malignancy worldwide . Surgical resection tumor curative treatment gastric cancer . However , surgical procedure accompanies postoperative pain prolonged hospitalization . To lessen surgical trauma stress , minimally invasive surgery introduce . Laparoscopic gastrectomy accept safe effective alternative open gastrectomy . Furthermore , reduce port single port laparoscopic gastrectomy consider minimize surgical trauma gastrectomy . However , limitation laparoscopic approach use reduce port include unergonomic posture surgeon , physiologic tremor collision instrument . To overcome limitation , robot surgery use novel single-site technology enable surgeon perform surgical procedure reduce number trocar three one insertion scope two robotic arm . Previously , successful application single-site technology cholecystectomy hysterectomy report . The aim study validate safety feasibility reduce port robotic distal gastrectomy use single-site technology surgical treatment gastric cancer .</brief_summary>
