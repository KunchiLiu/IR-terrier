	<detailed_description>Hypoglycaemia common side-effect insulin treatment people diabetes . Anglo-Danish study confirm high frequency hypoglycaemia affect people type 1 diabetes . The rate severe hypoglycaemia high 0.35 episode per patient-year . The human brain require constant supply glucose normal functioning , impaired hypoglycaemia . As consequence , cognitive motor function deteriorate rapidly significant consequence . This studied extensively know hypoglycaemia affect various domain cognitive function include short-term working memory , attention , non-verbal intelligence , visual auditory information processing , psychomotor function , spatial awareness , executive functioning . However , knowledge , effect acute hypoglycaemia social cognition study previously . Social cognition examine higher cognitive function involve interpret facial expression , gesture speech . It approach understanding human judgement behaviour . There anecdotal evidence negative behavioural response aggressiveness argumentativeness hypoglycaemia research show hypoglycaemia cause significant change mood , little information exist regard effect social cognition . It therefore know whether hypoglycaemia affect aspect cognitive function , , could explain people hypoglycaemic often resistant offer help ( example , may misinterpret friendly gesture threaten ) . Knowledge effect hypoglycaemia use educate relative carers people diabetes may suffer problem . Hypoglycaemia known effect electrophysiology heart . It cause prolongation QT interval ( represent interval Q wave T wave ECG ) , demonstrable electrocardiography may predispose individual increase risk cardiac arrhythmia . Studies show QT interval prolongation associate adrenaline secretion secondary sympathoadrenal activation acute episode hypoglycaemia provokes fall plasma potassium . Electrolyte imbalance know predispose arrhythmia know electrolyte disturbance hypoglycaemia may also affect QT interval . Using hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp technique , test social cognition administer one hour hypoglycaemia 20 adult type 1 diabetes . The study participant act control perform test euglycaemia separate study session separate least two week , use hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp technique . A Holter monitor use perform continuous ECG monitoring throughout duration study . Blood take measure plasma potassium , magnesium calcium concentration various time-points study seek acute change electrolytes hypoglycaemia . Study Aims 1 . To determine effect hypoglycaemia social cognition adult type 1 diabetes 2 . To determine effect hypoglycaemia blood electrolyte level QT interval ECG Methods Subjects undergo modify hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp initially maintain euglycaemia , follow experimental condition either hypoglycaemia euglycaemia 60 minute . Euglycaemia restore clamp discontinue . Tests social cognition administer within one hour experimental phase study . In addition , continuous ECG monitoring undertaken plasma electrolyte concentration measure different time point baseline , experimental recovery phase study . Study design procedure Each participant take part two session separate least two week : control experimental condition . Each session commence 08.00 hour overnight fast . Participants ask administer usual morning insulin dose study day . Female participant ask pregnancy test exclude pregnant individual . Studies take place Clinical Research Facility Royal Infirmary Edinburgh . The participant ask whether experience record episode hypoglycaemia precede 24 hour . This antecedent hypoglycaemia know modify counterregulatory symptomatic response subsequent hypoglycaemia . The study postpone hypoglycaemia ( symptomatic biochemical ) occur . The participant seated/reclined hospital bed table front use various computer paper base test social cognition . A Holter monitor , continuously record 3-lead ECG study , attach participant seat . A baseline 12-lead ECG also make . An intravenous cannula insert non-dominant hand vein regular sample blood glucose . Samples arterialise insert cannula retrograde manner heat blanket use warm hand standard practice . A second cannula insert vein antecubital fossa arm intravenous infusion glucose insulin . A modified hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp perform . After run-in period , arterialise blood glucose maintain 4.5 mmol/L 30 minute . Blood glucose either maintain 4.5 mmol/L throughout ( euglycaemia ) , lower 20 minute 2.5 mmol/L ( hypoglycaemia ) , maintain level 60 minute . At end experimental phase , euglycaemia ( 4.5 mmol/L ) restore maintained period 20 minute . The glucose clamp discontinue subject give meal . Subjects advise regard adjustment dos time insulin administration rest day study doctor experienced management insulin-treated diabetes . The subject inform condition study perform , undergo control ( i.e . euglycaemic ) experimental ( i.e . hypoglycaemic ) condition randomise counter-balanced fashion . Alternative form social cognition test also perform counter-balanced fashion . Every participant receive intervention randomisation limit order intervention receive . Tests social cognition : These perform experimental phase study , exception National Adult Reading Test perform baseline measure pre-morbid intelligence . 1 . Faux pas test : A faux pa occur someone say something say , realise say . In test faux pa detection , 10 short story read participant . They also present story write form read along read aloud . Out 10 story , 5 contain faux pa . After story , participant ask question base story order help determine recognise faux pa . The remain 5 story work control contain faux pa . This test take 10 minute deliver . Since participant act control , different set 10 story ; 5 contain faux pa 5 control , use manner described second visit . 2 . Reading mind eye : This validated test identifies subtle impairment social intelligence otherwise intelligent adult . In test participant present series 18 photograph ( printed paper ) eye-region face different actor , ask choose one word describe best person photograph feeling . The participant give choice 4 word . The participant provide glossary term come across test ask read glossary meaning word may familiar baseline phase study . The participant also advise glossary remains available reference throughout test . Since participant act control , different set 18 photograph show second visit instruction . 3 . The awareness social inference test ( TASIT ) : This test design assess ability `` read '' individual social cue assimilate make judgement speaker 's intention , attitude , feeling , etc . The participant show multiple short video laptop , lasting 15-60 second ask question actor 's intention , attitude meaning . Each video play follow question relate scene play video . The test contain 2 part : 1 . Social inference ( minimal ) The participant require determine speaker 's meaning intention base dialogue , emotional expression paralinguistic clue performer video . The participant test ability differentiate sincere exchange sarcastic exchange order look change social inference hypoglycaemic period . 2 . Social inference ( enrich ) This use series vignette , contain message literally untrue . Half represent sarcastic exchange . However half use script sarcasm vignettes one speaker lying , i.e. , he/she intend literal message accept contrary he/she believe . Since participant act control , similar number record vignette play second visit instruction . Edinburgh Hypoglycaemia Symptom Scale : This validated questionnaire use assess hypoglycaemic symptom . This applied baseline , start end experimental phase . General test cognitive function : The following test cognitive function repeatedly show affected hypoglycaemia quick administer . They therefore used confirm glucose nadir sufficient impair cognitive function . They administer time point Edinburgh Hypoglycaemia Symptom Scale . Trail Making B . This test assess visual conceptual visual motor track . The subject give hand hold tablet stylus present grid contain randomly position number letter , connect alternate numerical alphabetical order tap stylus ( ie 1 - A - 2 - B - 3 - C . ) The test score time take tap letter number screen correct order . Digit Symbol Test . This test measure sustain attention , response speed visuo-motor co-ordination . Rows blank square display piece paper . Each blank square pair number one nine . A printed key pair number different symbol , participant fill blank square symbols match number . The score number successful coding within 120 second time limit . Choice reaction time . Subjects present laptop ask press one four key quickly response appearance 4 ' X ' symbol computer screen . Holter monitor ECG recording : In addition look change social cognition , continuous ECG monitoring use 3 lead ECG Holter monitor use look QT interval change . The monitor attach participant start study remove end 20 minute recovery phase . In addition Holter monitoring , 12-lead ECGs take baseline , 30 minute experimental phase , end experimental phase end clamp occasion . If persist QT change end clamp , participant invite attend repeat ECG next day ensure ECG change resolve . There single case report persist QT interval prolongation 48 hour period hypoglycaemia 75 year old lady end-stage renal disease context acute myocardial ischaemia . Since recruit young population significant co-morbidities , would anticipate lasting ECG change . The QT interval determine tangent slope-intersect method . This automated measurement produce Holter machine . If U wave identify point , rhythm strip print QT interval determine manually researcher . This start QRS complex ( represent 'QRS complex ' ECG correspond depolarization ventricle heart ) till nadir T U wave . The QT interval also measure manually ( take start QRS complex till end T wave ) baseline ECG . QTc ( correct QT interval ) calculate use Bazett 's formula calculate divide QT interval square root RR interval . While number formula calculate QTc , recommend standard formula . Bazett 's formula commonly use clinically . It often criticise think inaccurate extreme heart rate , particular tachycardia . However , since widely use clinical practice calculate QTc , since expect subject exhibit extremes bradycardia tachycardia study blood glucose allow fall 2.5 mmol/L , choose use Bazett 's formula . Measurement electrolyte : Blood sample measurement plasma electrolyte concentration ( potassium , magnesium , calcium ) take baseline ; beginning , middle ( 30 minute end ( 60 minute ) experimental phase ; point euglycaemia restore euglycaemia maintain 20 minute . The blood sample spin immediately obtain . Statistical Methods The effect hypoglycaemia cognitive function assess repeated measure analysis variance , experimental condition within-subjects factor , order session ( euglycaemia-hypoglycaemia hypoglycaemia-euglycaemia ) between-subjects factor . This mean performance cognitive test compare patient hypoglycaemia euglycaemia study session . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS ( Statistical Package Social Sciences ) . A p value le 0.05 consider significant . Deterioration test score 0.5 standard deviation euglycaemia hypoglycaemia study session would consider clinically relevant change . With 20 subject , power study detect 0.5 standard deviation change test ( assume α=0.05 , reliability test=0.8 ) 94 .</detailed_description>
