	<brief_summary>As loss muscle mass age associate dysregulation muscle protein synthesis ( MPS ) generally characterize 'anabolic resistance ' nutrient , primary outcome trial investigate effect mixed macronutrient beverage post-prandial myofibrillar MPS . However , 'anabolic resistance ' age may predominantly influence contractile activity skeletal muscle ; example , investigator demonstrate 2 week reduce habitual activity ( i.e . daily step count ) induce anabolic resistance otherwise healthy old adult . In contrast , resistance exercise well-known enhance muscle mass increase sensitivity skeletal muscle dietary amino acid . Therefore , participant undergo 2-week reduced step count intervention combine unilateral leg resistance exercise protocol induce 'unhealthy ' 'anabolically resistant ' leg relatively 'healthy ' 'anabolically sensitive ' leg , respectively ; within subject model utilized investigate effect mixed macronutrient beverage relatively 'healthy ' 'unhealthy ' old muscle . The investigator also measure change muscle mass , muscle function , cardiovascular health leg 2-week intervention determine effect reduce activity protective effect minimal , low-intensity exercise outcome .</brief_summary>
