	<brief_title>L-dopa Versus Dopamine Agonists After Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Information Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) Subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) establish treatment patient advance Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . STN DBS improve dopaminergic drug-sensitive motor symptom , thus allow reduction post-operative drug dose . The reduction antiparkinsonian therapy turn alleviate L-dopa-induced motor fluctuation dyskinesias . However , considerable variation extent dopaminergic drug reduction report , value range 20 % 100 % . To date management antiparkinsonian medication STN DBS mainly rely neurologist 's personal experience patient 's preference , evidence-based guideline provide far , exception pragmatic recommendation postoperative issue promote Movement Disorders Society 2006 . Rationale study , potential risk benefit In immediate postoperative period follow STN DBS , simplification medication regimen advise , give complexity interaction stimulation medication . Both L-dopa DAs use , however , formal study examine type antiparkinsonian medication may effective and/or well tolerate follow STN DBS . In spite need simplification medication regimen STN DBS PD , date clinical trial specifically design compare efficacy ( term motor non-motor outcome ) safety L-dopa monotherapy versus DAs monotherapy follow STN DBS . Description population study Patients Parkinson 's disease advance stage undergo STN DBS . After one month since surgery , first program visit , patient randomize two group receive either L-dopa monotherapy DAs monotherapy ( either pramipexole ropirinole ) 2 month . Study objectives hypothesis Aim study compare efficacy safety L-dopa monotherapy versus DAs monotherapy STN DBS 3-month follow period . The hypothesis DAs may efficacious L-dopa treat non-motor symptom surgery , thus improve quality life follow surgery . On hand , comparison L-dopa , DAs might associate side effect ( particular impulse control disorder ) less effective motor control . Study design This study prospective , single blind trial randomized-pairs design compare L-dopa monotherapy DAs monotherapy STN DBS . The trial single-center pilot study , conduct Toronto Western Hospital , Toronto , Canada . The protocol meet Ethical Conduct Research Involving Humans . All patient provide write informed consent . A total 40 patient estimate enrol ( 20 patient treatment group ) . Duration study 15 month . Enrollment last 12 month . The center enroll patient pair , one patient randomly assign L-dopa monotherapy DAs monotherapy STN DBS . Randomization perform generate random sequence number block randomization . Treatment assignment unmask patient blind neurologist program DBS evaluate patient . Another neurologist charge medication adjustment . Randomization , monitoring , data management analysis perform Toronto Western Hospital . Selection subject Subjects screen perform standard pre-operative assessment ( include videotape L-dopa challenge , psychiatric evaluation , neuropsychological assessment visit neurosurgeon ) . If treat L-dopa DAs ( either pramipexole ropirinole ) prior surgery ask participate study . If accept , undergo first visit ( one month surgery ) . During first visit administer scale questionnaire evaluate motor non-motor symptom ( i.e . apathy , mood , sleep ) relate Parkinson 's disease . This evaluation last 1 hour . Then , enrol subject undergo surgery accord standard practice currently adopt Toronto Western Hospital . For first month surgery medication unchanged . After one month since surgery first program visit . During visit , enrolled subject randomize either join L-dopa group DAs group ( receive either pramipexole ropirinole ) . Study Interventions Bilateral simultaneous STN implant perform patient use standard stereotactic technique adopt Toronto Western Hospital . According standard practice currently adopt Toronto Western Hospital , DBS patient undergo pre-surgical evaluation ( include videotape L-dopa challenge verify response motor symptoms L-dopa , neuropsychological evaluation , psychiatric assessment visit neurosurgeon ) . Then , see one month surgery first program visit ( `` microlesional '' effect suppose go ) week subsequent 8 week ( order slowly adjust DBS parameter ) . The optimal stimulation setting progressively adjust accord patient 's response . The standard pulse set 60 μsec duration 130 Hz , voltage adjust individual patient . As regard antiparkinsonian treatment , patient randomly assign L-dopa monotherapy DAs monotherapy first program visit . During 8-weeks adjustment period , L-dopa DAs ( depend study arm ) slowly taper dose drug leave monotherapy adjust accord patient 's clinical condition . According standard practice , drug dosage adjust accord patient 's need maintain minimum sufficient level achieve optimal motor control absence side effect throughout duration study . In keep standard care Toronto Western , patient see 3 month since surgery completion study visit . However , unscheduled visit possible case unexpected clinical condition ( i.e . occurrence side effect worsen motor condition ) . L-dopa DAs ( pramipexole ropirinole ) well know drug , commercially available approve treatment monotherapy adjunct therapy Parkinson 's disease Canada Terapeutic Products Directorate Health Canada . All potential side effect actively monitor study . The total length study 15 month . First , patient screen suitability study . This happen patient perform standard pre-operative assessment ( include videotape L-dopa challenge , psychiatric evaluation , neuropsychological assessment visit neurosurgeon ) . If surgical candidate treat L-dopa DAs ( either pramipexole ropirinole ) prior surgery ask participate study . If accept , undergo first visit ( one month surgery ) . During first visit administer scale questionnaire evaluate motor non-motor symptom ( i.e . apathy , mood , sleep ) relate Parkinson 's disease . This evaluation last 1 hour . Then , patient undergo surgery accord standard practice currently adopt Toronto Western Hospital . For first month surgery medication unchanged . After one month since surgery patient first program visit . During visit , enrol patient randomize either join L-dopa group DAs group ( receive either pramipexole ropirinole ) . If assign L-dopa group gradually discontinue DAs , randomize join DAs group gradually discontinue L-dopa . Then , every patient see week subsequent 8 week optimize stimulation setting medical treatment . After 3 month since surgery enrol patient last visit study receive scale questionnaire evaluate motor non-motor symptom ( i.e . apathy , mood , sleep ) relate Parkinson 's disease . This evaluation last 1 hour . Throughout study patient perform approximately 9-11 visit , accord standard practice currently adopt Toronto Western Hospital . All evaluation conduct outpatient clinic . The assessment relative study administer enrolled subject twice ( pre-surgical assessment 3-month follow visit ) . Safety tolerability assess record frequency severity report adverse event visit . Statistical analysis The impact STN DBS non-motor symptom PD extensively study limited data available . Based data , anticipate order detect between-group change Non-motor Symptoms Scale ( NMSS ) least 23.3 point sample size least 20 patient per study arm , assume power 0.80 alpha value 0.05 . Such difference large seem NMSS total score range 0 360 . Furthermore , estimation compute pilot study small sample size . Beyond , NMSS also include subscore 9 domain . Those analyze well . Presurgical difference treatment group evaluate parametric non-parametric test , appropriate . Mean change continuous variable baseline 3-month follow STN DBS compare within treatment group use repeated measure analysis variance `` treatment group '' `` time '' independent categorical factor . The interaction dependent variable variable interest ( e.g . age , MDS-UPDRS-III , stimulation parameter ) enter model . Given nature study , standard non correct significance α level p &lt; 0.05 use . Direct access Source/Data Documents Reasonable access study data provide funder ( The Michael J . Fox Foundation Parkinson 's research , MJFF ) format prescribe ( defined one following : final clinical study report , final clinical datasets list de-identified accord HIPAA implementing regulation ) . MJFF , grant assessor , MJFF consultant use information internally make future funding decision . MJFF shall right audit review detail data related project . Quality control quality assurance procedure All clinical trial information record , handle , store way allows accurate reporting , interpretation , verification . Systems procedures assure quality every aspect trial implement ( i.e . check list ) . Quality control apply stage data handle ensure data reliable process correctly .</detailed_description>
