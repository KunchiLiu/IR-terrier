	<detailed_description>The straight Tenckhoff catheter ( sT ) common use catheter peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) . A new , expensive , self-locating catheter ( sLC ) develop Di Paolo . The investigator use parallel several year . To clarify catheter focus future investigator perform comparative study clarify outflow problem differ catheter . Study design : interventional randomized hospital Patients : Patients plan start PD inform ask participate randomize study . All patient ask accepted consent included investigation . At investigator hospital , insertion pertitnoean dialysis catheter perform open surgery . This perform use three layer suture technique perform local anesthesia . The technique enable immediate start dialysis surgery . Outflow problem define delay flow 40 minute 500ml PD fluid . The duration time calculated month PD . Patients die , transplant change hemodialysis censor . End-point insufficient drainage/flow dialysis fluid unabled adequate dialysis intervention ( surgery ) necessary correct/change catheter . Statistical analysis use Breslow test Kaplan Meier survival curve .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All consecutive patient eligible planned start peritoneal dialysis thereafter accept part study .</criteria>
