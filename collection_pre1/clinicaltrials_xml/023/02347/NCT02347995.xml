	<brief_summary>Stroke survivor experience severe muscle waste chronic phase recovery , implication strength , function general health . Although resistive exercise training effectively combat problem , unknown whether sub-optimal protein intake limit observe gain skeletal muscle growth . Skeletal muscle adaptation may occur resistive training ( RT ) combine nutritional therapy form post- exercise protein consumption . This study would first directly compare RT+protein supplementation RT+placebo ( calorie protein supplement ) chronic hemiparesis cause stroke , provide evidence-based rationale combination therapy clinical care population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The VA research team play prominent role document significant skeletal muscle atrophy accompany chronic hemiparesis disable stroke . Muscle volume reduce 24 % paretic vs. non-paretic leg , significant implication strength , function , fitness , metabolism general health . The investigator ' previous work establishes progressive , high-intensity resistive training ( RT ) effective rehabilitation strategy old stroke survivor , produce thigh muscle hypertrophy paretic non-paretic side . Protein supplementation significantly augment gain muscle mass RT healthy population , experiment yet conduct stroke . New preliminary data investigator ' group indicate stroke participant consume 20 % less protein recommend daily amount old individual ( 0.80 vs. 1.0 g/kg/day ) suggest relative gain skeletal muscle could significantly better presence adequate protein intake . New data also indicate leg muscle mass predict rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) stroke , imply combine nutrition RT therapy aim maximize muscle gain would translate improved energy balance , key factor rehabilitation success . A good understanding true potential aggressive RT intervention address stroke-related atrophy relate problem maximum benefit awaits clinical trial directly compare RT without nutritional therapy . The investigator propose conduct 12-week randomize placebo control clinical trial compare effect RT+ protein supplementation 1.2 g/kg/day ( RT+PRO ) vs. RT+isocaloric placebo ( RT+PLA ) body composition , hypertrophy , strength , functional mobility energy expenditure chronic stroke .</detailed_description>
