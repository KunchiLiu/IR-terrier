	<brief_summary>This study propose base work show diabetes drug Pioglitazone strongly inhibit growth tissue culture squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) skin . This occur concentration readily achievable oral administration drug use dos currently approve treatment diabetes . In study , propose enroll 40 non-diabetic adult subject ( 18-80 yr age inclusive ) document clinical history frequent occurrence skin squamous cell cancer receive Pioglitazone ( Actos® , Takeda Pharmaceuticals ) . Each subject receive usual care new tumor develop study ( i.e , excision plastic repair ) . The study protocol randomize ( 1:1 ) patient 6 month observation follow 6 month treatment ( group 1 ) 6 month treatment drug follow observation 6 month ( examine washout effect ) . The biopsy specimens collect therapy examine determine express AKR1C3 , enzyme believe increase resistance SCC prostaglandin inflammatory mediator . We also examine histologic grade remove tumor study whether Pioglitazone treatment decrease number aggressive versus well differentiate tumor study patient . This pilot study design detect statistically significant change SCC tumor number sponsor drug manufacturer . The data obtain used effect change product label .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single center open label feasibility pilot project base University Rochester . This study propose base work show diabetes drug Pioglitazone strongly inhibit growth tissue culture squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) skin . This occur concentration readily achievable oral administration drug use dos currently approve treatment diabetes . In study , propose enroll 40 non-diabetic adult subject ( 18-80 yr age inclusive ) document clinical history frequent occurrence skin squamous cell cancer receive Pioglitazone ( Actos® , Takeda Pharmaceuticals ) . Patients follow University Rochester Dermatology Clinic great 3 SCCs treat past year , without contraindication use pioglitazone , stable drug treatment regimen offer participation .The study cross-over design , patient enrol randomized one arm two treatment protocol : 1 ) six month usual care document characterize new tumor occur follow 6 month pioglitazone treatment plus usual care next 6 month 2 ) six month pioglitazone treatment follow 6 month treatment receive usual care . The second group offer opportunity ass whether persistent beneficial effect pioglitazone treatment end , tumor first group occur initial 6 month usual care characterize study parameter comparison tumor arise treatment . At end one year treatment period , number biopsy-proven new tumor patient develop take pioglitazone count compare number patient develop 6 month period receive treatment well number occur 6 month treatment ( washout effect ) . This information use basis large multicenter study . We also examine histologic grade remove tumor study whether Pioglitazone treatment decrease number aggressive versus well differentiate tumor study patient . This pilot study design detect statistically significant change SCC tumor number sponsor drug manufacturer . The data obtain used effect change product label . This study also assess secondary endpoint . First , examine whether ratio well-differentiated poorly differentiate SCC influenced subject treatment . This endpoint include unknown whether may signal mediate PPARγ one tumor morphology vs. another . Second , determine whether patient treatment might different number `` borderline '' lesion biopsied ; precancerous lesion often suspicious enough biopsy . It may fewer lesion category , well few squamous cell cancer . Basal cell cancer form skin cancer also document . Third , test tumor excise process routine diagnostic pathology see marker proliferation apoptosis influence PPARγ activity presence AKR1C3 alter . These endpoint would support idea change produce tumor incidence patient study drug relate mechanistic effect PPARγ propose . Subjects exclude study NYHA class I - IV cardiac status concern thiazolidinediones , Pioglitazone , may exacerbate congestive heart failure .</detailed_description>
