	<detailed_description>Community health center across US seek address grow prevalence diabetes adult . The University Chicago partner MidWest Clinicians ' Network ( MWCN ) conduct research study train community health center staff provider implement sustain diabetes group visit , also refer share medical appointment , health center . The study 's aim : 1 ) Develop , conduct , evaluate training program health center staff implement diabetes group visit intervention health center ; 2 ) Assess implementation diabetes group visit community health center set determine cost implementation ; 3 ) Assess feasibility cost implement text-messaging intervention addition implementation diabetes group visit CHC set one health center 4 ) Assess impact diabetes group visit alone diabetes group visit plus text-messaging diabetes process measure , patient outcome , patient satisfaction compare control patient health center six month follow-up six-month group visit program end . The MWCN Research Committee look six community health center ( CHC ) team comprise three four member participate study . The study last 18 month require study participant complete follow activity part study : - Attend two mandatory learn session Chicago spring fall 2015 last two day ( Friday Saturday day , 9am-5pm ) - Participate mandatory third learn session conduct series 4 5 weekly webinars spring 2016 - Participate monthly conference call and/or webinars intend track progress , trouble-shooting obstacle encounter , train month learn session - Complete training protection human subject research - Implement monthly diabetes group visit intervention least six month health center - Recruit 15 health center patient diabetes might benefit participate diabetes group visit enroll program - Complete four survey ( 20-60 minute ) , one brief evaluation ( 10-15 minute ) , monthly time expense log , one telephone interview ( 25-40 minute ) February 2015 May 2016 - Collect patient data survey administration two time-points patient attend least one group visit session telephone interview 1 ) patient say would enroll group visit program attend least one session 2 ) patient attend less four group visit session - Collect patient data EMR / chart abstraction 15 patient enroll group visit program three study time point course year mid-2015 mid-2016 30 patient participate group visit program serve control patient study.at one point mid-2016 . The learning session include various module topic develop base review current literature diabetes group visit intervention , preliminary research do site visit CHCs diabetes group visit experience , input MWCN Research Committee . The learning session also provide opportunity health center share unique experience learn health center ' experience . The first learning session provide overview benefit group visit , `` best practice '' implement diabetes group visit program health center , barrier challenge may arise implement diabetes group visit , strategy overcome barrier , factor facilitate implementation group visit affect sustainability . During first learn session , participate health center also time develop detailed plan implementation group visit program center . In addition , learn evaluate implementation program impact program patient outcomes . Each team also give patient curriculum guide tailor need patient population use implement diabetes group visit program health center . The health center select implement text-messaging intervention addition group visit intervention ask attend additional training module relate implementation text-messaging intervention . During six month follow first learn session , health center implement individualized program implementation plan , use rapid `` Plan-Do-Study-Act '' quality improvement strategy design , implement evaluate program . Ongoing conference call meeting , webinars listserv communication provide additional opportunity share , problem solving , peer support . The second learning session occur approximately six month , design allow CHC group visit team present de-identified aggregated baseline group visit patient data discus obstacle challenge encounter thus far . The third learning session hold year first session , time CHC group visit team present six-month de-identified aggregate group visit patient data , describe overcame challenge arise throughout implementation , discus concern regard sustainability . These team presentation take place online via hour-long webinars take place week approximately one month . This collaborative effort employ standard method data collection across participate health center assess CHC provider/staff training participant satisfaction training , perceive utility acceptability training , well confidence able implement sustain group visit program health center . Process outcomes include number group visit session hold ; attendance rate ; program cost ; challenge , barrier , facilitator benefit identify process implement group visit . Patient level data ( A1c , blood pressure , BMI , self-care behavior , satisfaction ) also collect analyze explore possible effect group visit intervention patient outcomes . Expected product project include evaluation train group visit intervention implement six Midwestern community health center , dissemination best practice implement diabetes group visit community health center setting , subsequent development pilot program full scale randomize controlled trial across multiple community health center . This pilot study also help participate health center problem-solve order overcome challenge implement sustain program health center understand provide good care patient area behavior modification diabetes management . Finally pilot conduct center select implement text-messaging intervention addition group visit intervention provide information feasibility additionally implement text-messaging intervention explore whether combined intervention could potential improve attendance group visit appointment , change health behavior , improve patient outcomes great extent group visit alone . Application Requirements : Health center interested apply participate research study expect : - Contact study coordinator screen eligibility complete application . - Complete attach application submit specify deadline along letter support Executive Director / CEO Medical Director health center state endorsement support participation center 's staff QI training program implementation initiative . - Designate minimum three four staff/providers center fully participate study 's activity describe first page request application . - Agree collect report de-identified group visit patient baseline , 6-month 12-month data post-follow-up period control patient data list application EMR / chart abstraction , well , collect report additional de-identified patient data survey administration select telephone interview . The MWCN Research Committee review application select six health center represent different region Midwest , offer diverse set patient population , demonstrate great interest ability attend learn session , implement diabetes group visit program center , collaborate evaluation train group visit intervention . If select participate study , health center 's executive director / CEO medical director ask sign enrollment contract acknowledge requirement study state support group visit team three four staff provider complete study requirement . Health center recruitment study close . Recruitment patient within select health center start May 2015 .</detailed_description>
