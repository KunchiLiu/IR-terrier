	<detailed_description>This prospective interventional trial conduct delivery unit OUS . The planned study consist five distinct phase step-wise intervention ; 1 ) baseline data collection , 2 ) introduce educational debriefing , 3 ) intensive run-in/rolling-refresher phase , 4 ) INSPIRE-D phase lastly 5 ) evaluation phase . Phase 1 : The baseline data collection phase 1 . Needs assessment/questionnaires participate healthcare provider collect include demographic data sex , age , education , work experience , well exposure resuscitation training , simulation , self-perceived confidence suggestion training/educational topic . 2 . Observations newborn resuscitation bay do video recording supplement resuscitation record , hospital quality improvement data medical record . Data point collect newborn demographic , gestational age , physiological parameter heart rate respirations/oxygenation , Apgar score , intervention perform , outcome discharge hospital . 3 . The healthcare provider adherence guideline neonatal resuscitation ( technical non-technical skill like team collaboration ) evaluate examine video recording score validated score system formerly test good intra- inter-rater reliability . The score system adapt guideline Norwegian Council Resuscitation retested intra- inter-rater reliability . Phase 2 : Intervention Phase Educational Debriefings 1 . Educational debriefing healthcare provider involve clinical situation newborn resuscitation : Selected resuscitation event debrief facilitate study team member special competence facilitation instructor neonatal resuscitation . The debrief hold depend clinical schedule availability , discuss process care , performance , provide education multidisciplinary staff advocacy/inquiry debrief technique . 2 . For healthcare provider ; contÂ¬inued need assessment prospective observation video-recordings resuscitation bay document quality care . 3 . Baseline skills assessment collect use novel manikin , Newborn Lung Simulator . Healthcare provider present mini-simulation compromise newborn ask perform high quality resuscitation . The performance adherence guideline evaluate retested intervention . Phase 3 - Intensive run-in high frequency train team reflection : `` The roll refresher phase '' 1 . In phase training trigger identified start day shift . A careful consideration perinatal factor mother infant identify `` high risk '' delivery baby may need resuscitation . If risk delivery identify , random Healthcare Provider team among present staff select . 2 . `` Just-in-time '' `` just-in-place '' training ; novel `` Rolling refresher '' , introduce ( target &gt; 80 % staff ) begin day shift . Health Care Providers care labour mother train trigger identify expose `` low dose '' simulation-based `` just-in-time '' `` just-in-place '' skill train . The short training session ( &lt; 10 minute ) take place on-site resuscitation bay relevant topic ; timely assessment need intervention , effective assist ventilation Newborn Lung Simulator . We use observation video-films target train focus rapid evaluation respiratory distress , correct ventilation technique use pulse oximetry . 3 . Continued simulation training base problem area identify baseline . Performance simulation training evaluate register . 4 . Educational debriefing continue , Phase 2 5 . Continued needs assessment prospective observation resuscitation bay document provider confidence , simulation performance quality care implementation INSPIRE-D bundle described . Phase 4 : Continued INSPIRE-D bundle . After successful implementation define &gt; 80 % staff least one `` just-in-time place '' training session , intervention ( phase 2 3 ) continue routine basis . Continued needs assessment confidence performance repeat describe . Phase 5 : Evaluation . Evaluation INSPIRE-D bundle identify define key factor process prove necessary ensure timely effective neonatal resuscitation associate improved newly bear survival neurologic outcome .</detailed_description>
