	<brief_title>Project JAY HAP Registration Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elderly patient , especially post-menopausal woman , often suffer femoral neck fracture due osteoporosis , even little trauma . Femoral neck fracture common disease elderly patient , account 3.6 % total body fracture . In China , population continue age life expectancy increase , incidence femoral neck fracture significantly increase . Hip replacement surgery include total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) hemiarthroplasty ( HAP ) . Hemiarthroplasty hip involve replacement diseased , affect , broken femoral head and/or neck prosthetic component . Hemiarthroplasty involve resurface acetabulum , therefore bipolar unipolar prosthetic head articulate host acetabular articular cartilage . Avoiding need , appropriate , resurface acetabulum help minimize surgical trauma , operative time dislocation risk , preserve acetabular bone stock . These also result short bed stay faster recovery compare THA . There increase import hip prosthesis past decade , surgeon choice implant . However , high cost import prostheses become barrier development hip replacement China cause many patient require immediate hip replacement delay miss surgery . The development promotion high-quality domestic joint implant surgical instrument key development joint replacement technique China . The primary objective study demonstrate non-inferiority subject implant SS Bipolar Head + SL-TWIN Stem compare randomized concurrent control group subject implant Bipolar Head + SL-PLUS Stem term mean Harris Hip Score ( HHS ) 1 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female subject , age 65 90 year inclusive Chinese ethnicity . Subject present femoral neck fracture ( Garden Type II , III , IV ) require hemiarthroplasty hip . Subject able move independently fracture , without use walking aid . Subject able give voluntary , write informed consent participate study consent obtain sign date ECapproved consent form . Subject able understand clinical study , cooperate investigational procedure willing return hospital require postoperative followup 12 month . Life expectancy subject 2 year . Bilateral hip disease anticipate need bilateral hip implant study participation ( i.e. , within next 12 month ) . Subject experience prior joint replacement surgery major joint ( hip , knee ) low limb within last 12 month . Subject know suspected metal sensitivity . Subject know insufficient bone stock result condition cancer , significant osteoporosis metabolic bone disorder , provide adequate support and/or fixation prosthesis . Subject severely obese ( BMI &gt; 35 ) . Subject suitable hemiarthroplasty ( i.e. , inflammatory arthritis , pathological fracture , etc . ) Subject active infection sepsis ( treat untreated ) Subject condition may compromise implant stability postoperative recovery ( i.e. , Paget 's Charcot 's disease , vascular insufficiency , muscular atrophy , uncontrolled diabetes , moderate severe renal insufficiency , hip abduction muscle strength less grade IV complete loss , neuromuscular disease ) . Subject emotional neurological condition would affect ability willingness participate study ( e.g . cognitive disorder , mental illness , mental retardation ) . Subject immunosuppressed , autoimmune disorder , immunosuppressive disorder . For example , subject immunosuppressive therapy ( corticosteroid hormone large amount , cytotoxic drug , antilymphocytic serum irradiation large dos ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . Subject know risk lose followup , failure return schedule visit . Subject enrol another investigational drug , biologic , device study last 12 month . Known alcohol and/or drug abuse</criteria>
