	<brief_summary>The optimal timing measure thyroglobulin ( Tg ) thyroidectomy unknown patient thyroid cancer . The ATA NCCN guideline specific optimal timing Tg level post-op state suggest anywhere 2-12 week . Hypothesis - Post -op Tg nadirs 6-8 week . Primary Objective -Determine optimal timing post thyroidectomy Tg nadir , determine accurate time check post operatively . Secondary Outcome - Determine factor affect Tg level post operatively . All adult age 19 already plan undergo near total /total thyroidectomy reason unrelated study . Measure Tg , Tg Ab TSH pre-op , post op -- - &gt; 7-14 day , 4 wk , 6 wk , 3 month patient pathology confirm benign disease . Measure Tg , Tg Ab , TSH pre-op , post op -- - &gt; 7-14 day , 4 wk , 6 wk , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month patient thyroid cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimal Measurement Thyroglobulin Measurement Following Thyroidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thyroid cancer , common endocrine tumor , constitute 3.8 % cancer . 62,980 new case estimate U.S. 20141 , increase trend 37,200 new case 20092 . 90 % thyroid cancer differentiate thyroid carcinoma ( DTC ) , include papillary follicular thyroid carcinoma3 . Management DTC involve total thyroidectomy , possible central lateral neck dissection clinical lymph node involvement , except low-risk lesion unifocal , intrathyroidal , node-negative measuring less 1 cm size . Radioactive iodine ablation remnant thyroid tissue may follow total thyroidectomy depend risk stratification patient3 . As cancer , management thyroid cancer involve long-term surveillance early detection disease recurrence3 . According ATA guideline , postoperative surveillance include regular ( every 6 12 month ) clinical evaluation tumor recurrence , evaluation neck ultrasound serum Thyroglobulin ( Tg ) level levothyroxine replacement3 . Serum Tg become useful well-acknowledged marker patient thyroid cancer post thyroidectomy disease persistence , metastasis recurrence . Thyroglobulin 660 kDa dimeric glycoprotein exclusively produce store thyroid follicular cell benign condition , also well-differentiated thyroid cancer cells4 . A total thyroidectomy high risk patient thus important provide definitive treatment decrease risk recurrence , also allow long term follow-up Tg level . One study report Tg eliminate liver half-life follow total thyroidectomy report 65.2 hour . The Tg level note decrease less 5-10 ng/ml 25 day thyroidectomy , 7 10 half-lives 11 patient samples5 . Detection Tg follow total thyroidectomy long-term surveillance would therefore suggest persistent thyroid tissue . Despite determined half-life Tg , retrospective study 36 patient low-risk papillary thyroid carcinoma , unstimulated Tg level fell &lt; 0.5 ng/ml 6 month postoperatively 61 % , 2 year postoperatively 100 % patients6 . No prospective study yet determine nadir Tg level post thyroidectomy . In personal clinical experience , unstimulated serum Tg level may find undetectable 6 12 week follow total thyroidectomy . The sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value negative predictive value unstimulated ( normal low TSH ) serum Tg assess completeness thyroidectomy ( &lt; 0.5 ng/ml ) report 70 % , 100 % , 100 % 92 % respectively6 . Obtaining basal unstimulated serum Tg level post thyroidectomy determine completeness total thyroidectomy7 , also provide basal level future comparison long-term surveillance . The high negative predictive value allow identification patient less likely disease recurrence provide less aggressive cost effective management strategies3 . The optimal time obtain unstimulated serum Tg level yet determine . Obtaining Tg level early follow total thyroidectomy may result misleadingly significant Tg level erroneously suggest residual disease , thereby lead unnecessary investigation aggressive management strategy . NCCN guideline suggest check anywhere 2-12 week patient thyroid cancer 8 Radioactive iodine ablation remnant thyroid tissue may potentially avoid postsurgical stimulate Tg level &lt; 1ng/ml low risk , well-differentiated thyroid cancer9 . This practice yet approve American Thyroid Association , less likely feasible concensus time Tg measurement . The objective study therefore find nadir unstimulated serum Tg level follow total thyroidectomy , therefore optimal time Tg measurement postoperative surveillance .</detailed_description>
