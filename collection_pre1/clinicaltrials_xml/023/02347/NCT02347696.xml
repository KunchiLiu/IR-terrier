	<detailed_description>The survey conduct population Castellana Grotte Putignano ( Bari , Italy ) evidence Non-Alcoholic Fatty liver Disease ( NAFLD ) reach prevalence 30 % , especially among age male individual . Being crucial outcome several metabolic alteration , becomes imperative Public Health adopt strategy aim control factor responsible NAFLD onset . The objective study evaluate effect two program different intensity level physical activity , low glycemic index Mediterranean Diet interaction , NAFLD score lipid composition erythrocyte membrane . Study participant respond inclusion criterion trial choose hospital set general practitioner ' clinic . At enrollement , anthropometric biochemical variable measure , well bioimpedenziometric calorimetric parameter ; participant also undergo Fibroscan-CAP measure outcome ask medical history life-style . Subjects randomized different arm trial followed-up end sixth twelfth week enrollement . All data statistically analyse apply Chi-Square test t-test discrete continuous variable , respectively . As deal analysis data repeatedly measure subject , Generalized Estimating Equation ( GEE ) apply evaluate effect intervention outcome .</detailed_description>
