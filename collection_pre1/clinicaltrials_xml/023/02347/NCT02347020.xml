	<brief_title>Impact Sleep Meal Timing Food Intake Regulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleeping pattern affect aspect metabolism may impact obesity risk ; lab interested study whether sleep pattern play role development obesity . Individuals late bedtime late rise time tend great food intake include fast food sugar-sweetened beverage , le fruit vegetable [ 1 ] , large portion , later eat time [ 2 ] earlier bedtimes . This sleep pattern highly prevalent : ~15 million Americans work shift regular day hour [ 3 ] others subject 'social jetlag ' ( time difference middle sleep episode [ midpoint sleep ] work day non-work day , similar travel across time zone ) [ 4 ] . The shift sleep meal time associated lifestyle result misalignment sleep eating behavior circadian clock . These clock , locate brain organ throughout body , regulate metabolism behavior affect sleep feeding . Disruption clock gene individual organ may part responsible metabolic dysregulation [ 5 ] . Altering coordination sleep meal timing may affect food reward valuation ( brain ) metabolism ( peripheral organ ) promote obesity IR , observe frequently shift worker . This focus randomize , crossover , control study 4 phase : - Normal sleep ( Ns ; 0000-0800 h ) , Normal meal ( Nm=meals 1 , 5 , 11 , 12.5 h awaken ) =Ns/Nm - Normal sleep ( Ns ; 0000-0800 h ) , Late meal ( Lm=meals 4.5 , 8.5 , 14.5 , 16 h awaken ) =Ns/Lm - Late sleep ( Ls ; 0330-1130 h ) , Normal meal ( Nm=meals 1 , 5 , 11 , 12.5 h awaken ) =Ls/Nm - Late sleep ( Ls ; 0330-1130 h ) , Late meal ( Lm=meals 4.5 , 8.5 , 14.5 , 16 h awaken ) =Ls/Lm Aim 1 : To determine whether Ls and/or Lm , individual habitual normal sleep duration timing , alter one side energy balance , i.e . food intake energy expenditure ( EE ) , relative Ns Nm . - Hypothesis 1 : ( ) Ls Lm independent interactive effect food intake EE . Intake ad libitum test meal 24 h period , measure 3 intervention , great Ls Lm , enhance Ls Lm combine , compare Ns Nm . ( b ) Resting metabolic rate ( RMR ) low Ls Lm phase , reduce Ls Lm combine compare Ns Nm phase ( Ns/Nm &lt; Ls/Nm≤Ns/Lm &lt; Ls/Lm ) . Aim 2 : To determine whether neuronal response food stimulus brain region related reward value explain difference food intake . • Hypothesis 2 : ( ) Increased brain activity response visual presentation food stimulus , use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , see Ls Lm compare Ns Nm insula orbitofrontal cortex . Enhanced neuronal activity response food pronounce Ls/Lm phase ( Ns/Nm &lt; Ls/Nm≤Ns/Lm &lt; Ls/Lm ) . ( b ) Neuronal response food stimulus relate pre-test neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) , hypocretin-1 , subsequent food intake . Exploratory Aim 3 : To determine whether meal sleep timing affect glucose homeostasis appetite-regulating hormone . • Hypothesis 3 : Ls Lm result lower insulin sensitivity ( frequently sample i.v . glucose tolerance test [ FSIVGTT ] meal tolerance test [ MTT ] ) Ns Nm ( Ns/Nm &gt; Ls/Nm≥Ns/Lm &gt; Ls/Lm ) . Sleep meal time independent interactive effect 24-h pattern hormone regulate food intake ( low leptin glucagon-like peptide-1 [ GLP-1 ] ; high ghrelin , NPY hypocretin-1 ) .</detailed_description>
