	<brief_summary>Complex Regional Pain syndrome Type I ( CRPS-I ) chronic progressive disease . Patients experience dramatic decline overall well-being , despite absence apparent physical cause . The main symptom hypersensitivity pain ( hyperalgesia ) experience normal tactile stimulation painful ( allodynia ) absence peripheral nerve damage . The debate aetiology CRPS-I still open . The therapy offer CRPS-I patient diverse involve invasive non-invasive intervention . Current ( inter ) national guideline recommend physiotherapy best non-invasive treatment rehabilitation . Recently , cognitive behavioural Graded Exposure Vivo ( GEXP ) therapy aim reduce pain-related fear find effective ( De Jong et al . 2005 ) , effective standard physical therapy ( ReMOVE study , article preparation ) . By reduce pain-related fear EXP might reconcile motor output sensory feedback . Another type pain low back pain ( LBP ) , affect 70 % 85 % general population , usually heals within 12 week 90 % patient . The rest patient suffer intractable , chronic LBP despite evident organic abnormality . Research show also patient cognitive behavioural aspect pain important related physical performance self-reported disability ( Vlaeyen et al. , 2000 ) . Several study demonstrate success GEXP patient group : GEXP result improvement pain-related fear , catastrophizing , performance daily relevant activity , pain intensity ( Leeuw et al. , 2008 ) . This study aim investigate effect GEXP brain region involve process harmless tactile stimuli CRPS-I CLBP patient , well effect tactile discrimination threshold . We hypothesize GEXP induce 1 ) improvement tactile discrimination threshold , 2 ) functional reorganization primary secondary somatosensory cortex ( region relate affected limb CRPS-I ; back LBP ) , 3 ) change activation emotional brain circuit non-noxious stimulation , 4 ) change rest state connectivity emotional sensory brain area , 5 ) change measure reflect white matter integrity . No systematic change expect healthy control . Patients diagnose CRPS-I CLBP participate Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) experiment . In observational study , examine effect GEXP treatment patient receive part usual care . Anatomical well diffusion-weighted T2*-weighted ( Blood oxygenation level dependent ) MR image acquire . The study 3x4 split plot design group ( CRPS-I patient CLBP receive GEXP treatment / healthy control ) between-subjects variable time ( pre- , , post-treatment follow-up ) within-subject variable .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>CRPSI patient : A clinical diagnosis CRPSI accord 'the Budapest criterion ' research purpose ( Harden et al. , 2007 ) : Continuing pain , disproportionate inciting event Must report least one symptom four follow category : Sensory : Reports hyperesthesia and/or allodynia Vasomotor : Reports temperature asymmetry and/or skin color change and/or skin color asymmetry Sudomotor / Edema : Reports edema and/or sweating change and/or sweat asymmetry Motor / Trophic : Reports decrease range motion and/or motor dysfunction ( weakness , tremor , dystonia ) and/or trophic change ( hair , nail , skin ) Must display least one sign time evaluation two follow category : Sensory : Evidence hyperalgesia ( pinprick ) and/or allodynia ( light touch and/or temperature sensation and/or deep somatic pressure and/or joint movement ) Vasomotor : Evidence temperature asymmetry and/or skin color change and/or asymmetry Sudomotor / Edema : Evidence edema and/or sweat change and/or sweat asymmetry Motor / Trophic : Evidence decrease range motion and/or motor dysfunction ( weakness , tremor , dystonia ) and/or trophic change ( hair , nail , skin ) There diagnosis well explain sign symptom Unilateral localization upper low extremity CLBP patient : Experience nonspecific low back pain least three month No diagnosis well explain sign symptom . patient group : Report substantial fear movement/ ( ) injury Age 18 65 year Stable medication healthy control : Age 18 65 year Matched age , gender handedness patient healthy control : Neuropathy upper low extremity MRI incompatible health condition ( e. g. pacemaker , metal prosthetic device ) Psychiatric condition ongoing medication would alter emotional/sensory process Previous tactile impairment upper low extremity cause : damage sensory apparatus CNS lesion healthy control : â€¢ ( history ) CRPS chronic pain syndrome</criteria>
