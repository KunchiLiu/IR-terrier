	<detailed_description>The Oncotype DX assay commercially available U.S. since 2004 tool aid physician 's treatment recommendation breast cancer patient . While Oncotype DX assay currently reimburse Ontario Health Ministry node-negative EBC , reimburse node-positive ( N+ ) patient although assay show prognostic predictive chemotherapy benefit patient N+ disease . The goal study characterize result Oncotype DX® assay impact decision making process physicians patient large academic medical center Ontario evaluate recommendation adjuvant therapy within population ER+ , N+ EBC patient 1 3 positive lymph node benefit adjuvant chemotherapy certain . Upon consent , patient assign ID number . The physician discus patient 's treatment alternative prior order Oncotype DX assay . After discussion patient , physician complete baseline questionnaire indicate therapeutic strategy he/she would recommend patient base upon available clinical pathologic data . In addition , patient also complete baseline questionnaire indicate treatment preference , base previous discussion physician . The Oncotype DX assay order receipt Registration Confirmation Eligibility Form assignment patient study number . Once result Oncotype DX assay available , physician discus result patient . Both physician patient complete separate follow-up post-assay questionnaire result Oncotype DX assay know shared patient .
