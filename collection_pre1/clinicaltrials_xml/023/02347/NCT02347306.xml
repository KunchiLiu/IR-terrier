	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease remain leading cause death worldwide . Identifying individual patient risk suture adverse event , include myocardial infraction ( heart attack ) , remain major diagnostic challenge . Recent study show coronary plaque responsible hear attack compose large lipid core thin overlie fibrous cap . Although feature identify use invasive imaging modality , non-invasive imaging option remain limited due poor spatial resolution . Recently investigator develop validate novel tool allow u characterise coronary plaque composition base dual source CT image . Our aim ass tool within cohort patient already undergone coronary CT part previous study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Identification High-risk Coronary Plaques Through Non-invasive Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reliable identification coronary plaque risk cause future adverse cardiovascular event would allow patient-specific target intensive therapy . The majority event precipitate coronary plaque rupture , rupture plaque exhibit large necrotic , lipid core superimpose thrombus . The propose precursor lesion share similar plaque compositional feature rupture plaque thin overlie fibrous cap term thin-cap fibroatheroma ( TCFA ) 1 . At present major emphasis image modality identify higher-risk plaque subtypes . We previously validate invasive imaging modality , virtual-histology intravascular ultrasound ( VH-IVUS ) histology , find VH-IVUS identified TCFA diagnostic accuracy 74 % 2 . In prospective study , VH-defined TCFAs associate 7x great risk future event plaque subtypes3 . Although technique show promise permit plaque-based risk stratification , limited invasive nature . Thus , alternate , non-invasive imaging option require widespread risk assessment . Recently , devise novel method create `` Plaque Maps '' use CT attenuation data individualise patient ( Figure 1 ) , permit identification coronary plaque component diagnostic accuracy 75 % -85 % 4 . However , whilst CT Plaque Maps could identify fibroatheroma similar diagnostic accuracy VH-IVUS ( 79 % vs. 74 % ) , spatial resolution CT unable detect thin fibrous cap distinguish fibroatheroma TCFA ( Figure 2 ) . More recently introduce necrotic core/fibrous plaque ratio possible Plaque Map surrogate identification TCFA . Using ratio &gt; 0.58 , sensitivity detect TCFA 84 % specificity 75 % ; improvement previously identify CT-defined feature high risk plaques4 . Whether novel strategy prospectively improve identification plaque vulnerability unproven .</detailed_description>
