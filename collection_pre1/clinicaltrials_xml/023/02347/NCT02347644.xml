	<brief_summary>The objective study explore efficacy brief motivational intervention ( BMIs ) treatment youth alcohol drug problem least 3 month . The result previous study indicate brief intervention unhealthy alcohol use show effective primary care setting , study focus adult study focus youth . To date , BMI study conduct Ukraine among youth alcohol drug use . Of particular concern emerge adult age 18-25 may particularly high risk alcohol problem give historical event related fall Soviet Union subsequent economic turn . This study evaluate efficacy BMI compare BMI BMI condition among two sample youth screen positive prescreen survey risky drinking . The subject pool come Psychoneurological Department : first location locate Railway Clinical Hospital , clinical base , second class department Kiev National Medical University . The total sample 120 broken 1 . ) 60 patient Railway Clinical Hospital ; 2 . ) 60 student Kiev National Medical University . Participants stratify recruitment site randomize condition : BMI control , follow-up assessment 3 month . In addition first study evaluate efficacy BMI substance use problem among youth Ukraine , study examine BMI intervention process relation alcohol drug outcome .

	<detailed_description>Research Hypothesis 1 . The rate correlate alcohol drug use , abuse dependence , among young adult age 18-25 present Psychoneurological Department Railway Clinic Hospital Kiev Kyiv National Medical University high prescreen survey may relate self-identification problem . 2 . The quality life young people alcohol substance use problem low compare people without problem . The quality life improve Brief Motivational Interventions . 3 . The rate intentional unintentional injury ( e.g. , motor vehicle , violence relate ( fight ) , sport injury , non-suicidal self-injury behavior ) high among emerge adult great alcohol drug use . 4 . The Brief Motivational Interventions help young people alcohol substance use problem effective drink motif social enhancement/externalizing less depression , anxiety level , sleep disorder , impulsivity , sensation seek , aggression . 5 . The Brief Motivational Interventions help young people alcohol substance use problem find effective reduce primary outcome ( alcohol drug use , well substance use related consequence ) secondary outcome ( depression anxiety level , sleep disorder , aggression , quality life ) . Background According World Health Organization ( WHO ) , youth Ukraine great level alcohol consumption world , typical age initiation 10 - 13 year old . When examine poisoning among youth Ukraine , 60 % cause alcohol 3 . Although legal drinking age Ukraine 18 wine liquor , beer legally classify alcoholic beverage thus minimum drinking age . In 2011WHO ranked Ukraine 5th world caput alcohol consumption . Recently , attempt make address issue . For example , 2010 legislation pass restrict access low alcohol content beverage ( e.g. , beer ) youth , prohibit access various setting ( i.e. , public transportation , education , playground , etc. ) . Young adult particularly interest cohort examine Ukraine , youth raise follow downfall Soviet Union 1991 , socio-economic downturn . For example , data Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey show 4 10 male 1 10 female drink alcohol last month . Despite alarm statistic , paucity data exist examines correlate alcohol use among young adult Ukraine . Consistent problem behavior theory , variety study U.S. Europe show alcohol use problem behavior tend cluster adolescence young adulthood , likely due share risk protective factor , researcher clinician view alcohol misuse self-harm behavior . Although commonly , self-harm connotation intentional , self-inflicted , physical injury suicide attempt , substance use eat disorder may also consider non-suicidal self-harm behavior . Further , researcher assign choice involvement HRO ( e.g. , increased risk injury include unintentional death ) non-observance safety rule work self-harm behavior . The boundary suicide non-suicidal self-harm behavior always clearly define , case behavior usually fall outside boundary self-harm may indeed represent self-harm perform explicit intent cause tissue damage . Self-harm listed DSM-IV-TR symptom borderline personality disorder comorbid disorder . The motivation self-harm vary , may use fulfill number different function . For example , may function cop mechanism , provide temporary relief intense feeling ( e.g. , anxiety , depression , stress , emotional numbness ) , sense failure self-loathing , mental trait include low self-esteem . Self-harm common adolescence young adulthood , usually first appear age 12 24 . Early intervention emerge adult risky drinking may effective use resource exclusive focus treatment alcohol use disorder ( Nathan , 1988 ) . A pilot study conduct Ukraine survey emerge adult inpatient hospital find think alcohol problem . Further , data find common motif alcohol use related cop negative affect ( e.g. , stress , anxiety ) social influence ( e.g. , friend use alcohol ) . These finding similar American study college student , common motif drink include : coping-anxiety , coping-depression , social , enhancement , conformity ( Grant et al. , 2007 ) . In regard , brief motivational intervention ( BMIs ) may useful enhance desire change behavior address motif use order reduce risk future alcohol problem . The need early intervention may particularly important young adult alcohol use co-morbid anxiety and/or depression . In spite available literature data problem alcohol consumption lack information efficacy BMIs reduce alcohol substance use among emerge adult Ukraine . Among emerge adult U.S. , study suggest BMI approach promise among emerge adult . In Europe , study also show high efficacy BMI youth adult . The goal German study gain knowledge target group medically refer alcohol intoxicated adolescent young adult , identify utility administer BMI . Namely , researcher try find age gender structure participant , alcohol drug use history history previous incident acute alcohol intoxication , risky substance use symptom psychopathology . Also , assess many participant BMI take advantage recommend counsel regard alcohol use . Third , examine characteristic group `` help accepters '' differs group `` help avoiders '' regard socio-demographic characteristic substance use pattern . Yet , research face several limitation . First , BMI semi-structured . It uncontrolled stage- 1-design ( control group ) ; thus , researcher able demonstrate efficacy BMI . It remain unclear , BMI initiate change motivation effect motivational enhancement . The efficacy subsequent youth-specific counseling service examine . Another European study illuminates exist evidence concern efficacy brief motivational intervention [ 20 ] . Thus , remain unanswered question around effectiveness brief alcohol intervention across different setting , different population group include emerge adult , optimal intervention content , longevity intervention effect . In regard , recent U.S. study primary care use Composite International Diagnostic Interview Alcohol Module identify adult alcohol problem 3 randomize control trial compare BMI BMI . These conduct USA order identify key intervention component . This study examine 3 set audio-recorded BMIs ( 2 null study - difference drinking BMI BMI group ; 1 positive study - less drinking BMI group compare BMI group ) . The drinking decrease among participant 3 study . Intervention characteristic consider central efficacious BMIs ( change self- report drink quantity and/or frequency , drink intensity drinking within recommended limit ) strong predictor drink outcome . The quality BMI process predictive study may require attention factor beyond construct typically examine . Therefore , detailed analysis prospective study necessary . For example , vary efficacy BMI may depend different factor drink motif , impulsivity , depression , anxiety , sleep disorder , aggression . Study Design Over one year period , Psychoneurological Department base study use randomize control trial ( RCT ) design . Also , Psychological Faculty Kyiv National Medical University . Eligible young adult complete screen survey . Given fact plan include patient student , choose subject pool study combine psychiatric ward base student university . Those risky drinking enrol RCT randomize condition stratify patient/student give either brief motivational intervention control brochure . A follow-up assessment conduct 3 month . Statistical Design SPSS software version 18 use data analysis . A regression model apply accord distribution data .</detailed_description>
