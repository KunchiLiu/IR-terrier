	<brief_title>Pilot Pharmacogenetic Study Antiarrhythmic Drugs Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.0 Background While atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common sustain cardiac arrhythmia require therapy , also associate increase risk stroke , heart failure , myocardial infarction , dementia , death . The number Americans affect AF expect surge nearly 16 million year 2050 . The AF epidemic may part relate age population increase prevalence recently identify risk factor include obesity , metabolic syndrome , obstructive sleep apnea , inflammation . Furthermore , increase support idea common rare genetic variant also increase susceptibility AF clinically manifest presence acquire risk factor . While clinical risk factor AF establish , genetic component `` multiple-hit '' genetic model development AF recently identify . Despite recent advance catheter-based surgical therapy , anti-arrhythmic drug ( AADs ) remain mainstay treatment patient symptomatic AF . However , response individual highly variable half patient treat AADs suffer recurrence AF within 6 12 month . The limited success therapy AF relate poor understanding underlie pathophysiology , heterogeneity electrical structural substrate , lack targeted mechanism-based therapy . Thus , one major knowledge gap predict response AADs individual patient . Contemporary membrane-active drug use suppress AF incompletely unpredictably effective associate significant risk proarrhythmia non-cardiac toxicity . Furthermore , current 'one-size fit ' approach select AAD therapy patient symptomatic AF base largely minimize risk adverse event rather likelihood efficacy . Recent advance understand genetic mechanism AF support overarch hypothesis wish test future study variability response AAD therapy modulate common genetic variant associate AF . Several AF susceptibility locus identify validate genome-wide association study . In addition , show common AF risk single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) chromosome ( chr ) 4q25 locus predict poor response AADs also recurrence AF ablation therapy cardioversion . While genetic approach AF reveal susceptibility AF response therapy modulate part underlie genetic substrate , translation discovery bedside management AF patient thus far limited . This relate poor understand underlying mechanism associated common AF risk allele , challenge associate determine efficacy AADs lack genotype-directed prospective study . Our preliminary data show common chr4q25 SNP associate AF predict successful symptom control patient treat AADs individual carry risk variant respond good Vaughan Williams class I vs. class III AADs . Based information collect feasibility pilot study , propose conduct prospective pharmacogenomic study cohort patient frequent symptomatic paroxysmal AF randomize flecainide ( class I AAD ) sotalol ( class III AAD ) order determine response therapy modify chr4q25 SNPs use AF burden metric drug efficacy . This main study , like pilot study propose , utilize crossover design minimize inter-individual variability maximize statistical power detect interaction chr4q25 genotype reduction AF burden flecainide vs. sotalol . After run-in period AAD up-titrated , subject monitor Medtronic Reveal LINQ Insertable Cardiac Monitor ( ICM ) system assess AF burden . Furthermore , subject ask complete comprehensive , validate 20-item AF specific questionnaire ( AF Effect QualiTy-of-life [ AFEQT ] ) baseline , monthly thereafter duration study . At end 3-month trial period , AAD discontinue participant switch AAD follow another 3-month period crossover trial design . 2.0 Rationale Specific Aims We others show common SNPs chr4q25 locus associate increase risk AF modulate symptomatic response AADs . Furthermore , preliminary data suggest differential response class I vs. class III membrane-active drug . Here , propose pilot study obtain preliminary data regard AF burden patient receive AADs demonstrate feasibility future study test hypothesis chr4q25 risk SNPs modulate differential response AADs patient frequent symptomatic paroxysmal AF use reduction mean AF burden metric drug efficacy . Therefore , Specific Aim pilot/feasibility study obtain preliminary data regard AF burden patient receive AADs demonstrate feasibility future study test hypothesis chr4q25 SNPs modulate differential response class I vs. class III AADs patient frequent symptomatic AF . 3.0 Previous Human Studies Chr4q25 SNPs modulate differential response AADs patient AF In preliminary study address whether symptomatic response AAD therapy modulate 3 common AF susceptibility locus chr4q25 ( near PITX2 ) , 16q22 ( ZFHX3 ) , 1q21 ( KCNN3 ) . We study 478 ( discovery cohort ) 198 ( validation cohort ) age gender match Caucasian patient Vanderbilt AF Registry . Response AAD therapy define successful rhythm control patient remain AAD therapy minimum 6 month ≥ 75 % reduction AF symptom . Multiple clinical variable ( include age , hypertension , lone AF ) fail predict response AADs . However , SNP 4q25 locus ( rs10033464 ) significantly associate successful symptom control ( odds ratio [ OR ] 2.97 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.42-6.21 , P=0.003 ) . Furthermore , individual carry 4q25 SNP respond good class I vs. class III AADs discovery validation cohort . These preliminary finding provide rationale future study suggest common AF susceptibility variant differentially modify response class I vs. class III AADs patient frequent symptomatic AF . 4.0 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criterion - Caucasians ≥ 18 year age - History typical lone symptomatic AF - AF symptom present least per month - ECG record within 12 month randomization show AF - Starting Class I Class III AAD - In sinus rhythm enrollment - Able give inform consent Exclusion criterion - Permanent AF isolate atrial flutter . - Cardiac thoracic surgery within previous 6 month - Previous use amiodarone short-term use ( e.g . acute arrhythmia hospital ) - Medical condition likely fatal less one year - Received 2 AADs past - Creatinine clearance &lt; 40 ml/min - Contra-indication class I AAD e.g. , structural heart disease , history MI - Contra-indication class III AAD , e.g. , congenital acquire long QT syndrome QTc &gt; 450 m baseline - A reversible cause AF ( e.g. , thyrotoxicosis ) - Previously treat class I class III antiarrhythmic drug - Females pregnant nursing . - History severe AV node dysfunction unless electronic pacemaker present - Any race Caucasian - First- second-degree relative already participate study . 5.0 Enrollment/Randomization Patients ≥18 year age symptomatic paroxysmal AF enrol Arrhythmia Cardiology Clinics , Adult Emergency Department , inpatient Cardiology service Vanderbilt University Medical Center .

Rather , study provide vitally important currently unavailable data mean standard deviation AF burden therapy study drug . These data use conduct formal sample size calculation main trial . This study also examine feasibility crossover design , feasible , utilized main trial . Statistical analysis : The primary study endpoint AF burden ( proportion time patient AF ) calculate patient undergoing therapy study drug . The primary endpoint express study drug median , 25th percentile , 75th percentile . The difference AF burden class I class III AADs compare use Wilcoxon signed-rank test pair data . We conduct exploratory analysis use linear regression model detect association genotype AF burden adjustment age sex . First , analyze model include separate term three chr4q25 SNPs simultaneously adjustment age sex . Then create second model replaces separate chr4q25 SNP term combine chr4q25 risk score calculate add beta-coefficients genotype rs2200733 , rs17570669 , rs3853445 find first model . If multivariable analysis demonstrates combine chr4q25 risk score study drug assignment significantly associate AF burden , test statistical interaction determine whether chr4q25 AF susceptibility locus determine differential response class I class III AADs . It emphasize analysis underpowered over-fitted pilot/feasibility study . 11.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues All research hard copy record store locked cabinet within locked office access research personnel .
