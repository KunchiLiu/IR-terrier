	<brief_summary>The investigator 's hypothesis active injector show partial reduction marker immune activation HCV therapy whereas non-injectors show significant reduction marker , exhibit level immune activation approach see similarly study healthy volunteers.This base observation group investigator make . They show individual inject drug high level immune activation blood tissue . Immune activation chronic inflammation associate accelerate age , cardiovascular , renal liver disease well CNS dysfunction . It remain unclear whether increased level immune activation due non-sterile injection drug , chronic infection Hepatitis C , chronic opiate use , perhaps combination 3 . To understand potential contribution infection Hepatitis C investigator compare level immune activation pre- post treatment oral , one pill daily , interferon spar treatment HCV 2 group chronically HCV infect patients- one actively inject drug free injection least 4 month . Immune activation comparison also include non-injecting healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunologic Effects HCV Therapy With HARVONI HCV Genotype 1 Chronically Mono-infected Active Former IDUs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This group multidisciplinary investigator discover increased level immune activation among HIV-1-uninfected active injection drug user ( IDUs ) compare non-IDU control . The vast majority ( 80 % ) also infect HCV . Active injector high level immune activation measure sCD14 , CD8 co-expression CD38 HLA-DR , well Type 1 cytokine . Within month cease injecting , observable decrease parameter however general remain elevated compare non-injecting healthy volunteer . As approximately 80 % subject HCV infect viremic , result confound cause observe increased level marker immune activation- active injection chronic Hepatitis C. Until recently HCV treatment require use IFN immunomodulatory activity would cause perturbation marker immune activation . However development direct act agent ( DAA ) treat HCV revolutionize therapy . In trial investigator employ daily FDC formulation sofosbuvir ledipasvir ass change marker immune activation therapy . There multiple clinical trial FDC LDV-SOF patient Genotype 1 HCV . When take daily 12 week , sustain virologic response rate high response rate near 99 % study 12-week course therapy . Common adverse event associate FDC LDV-SOF ION-1 include fatigue ( 21 % ) , headache ( 25 % ) , nausea ( 11 % ) , insomnia ( 8 % ) , asthenia ( 7 % ) , diarrhea ( 11 % ) , rash ( 7 % ) , irritibility ( 7 % ) , cough ( 3 % ) , pruritis ( 5 % ) . Ledipasvir undergoes minimal metabolism expectation medication clinically significant drug-drug interaction . In general , sofosbuvir consider relatively clinically significant drug-drug interaction , coadministration sofosbuvir follow medication recommend medication may significantly lower sofosbuvir level : Anticonvulsants : carbamazepine , oxycarbazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin Antimycobacterials : rifabutin , rifampin , rifapentine Herbal Supplements : St. John 's wort HIV Protease Inhibitors : tipranavir-ritonavir Antiarrhythmic Drugs : amiodarone ( Cordarone® , Nexterone® , Pacerone® ) Participants provide 12-week course FDC LDV-SOF provide near 99 % likelihood SVR participant adherent therapy low likelihood significant adverse event drug-drug interaction . In treat HCV effectively investigators measure change immune activation gene expression accompany HCV treatment .</detailed_description>
