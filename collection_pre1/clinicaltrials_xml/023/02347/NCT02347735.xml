	<brief_summary>Rationale : Colorectal cancer fourth common cause cancer death worldwide , estimate responsible almost 610,000 death 2008 . Surgery remain predominant curative treatment type colorectal cancer , major impact patient 's wellbeing demand large amount metabolic reserve . This lead development frequently observe severe postoperative complication . The important complication colorectal surgery anastomotic leakage ( AL ) , incidence 8-15 % Netherlands . AL associate high short-term mortality rate 40 % . Even though many attempt make reduce incidence dread complication , none intervention successful far . Despite proper patient selection improvement surgical technique , percentage AL stable year . Objectives : To investigate whether recently identify patient-specific factor predict occurrence anastomotic leakage patient undergo elective surgery colorectal cancer . Study design : Prospective observational study Study population : Adult colorectal cancer patient undergo elective surgery . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary endpoint : AL within 30 day postoperatively Secondary endpoint : Intestinal microbiome fecal sample , I-FABP , SM22 , Calprotectin , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , Citrullin , complement factor blood , VOCs exhale air , COX-2 &amp; MBL polymorphisms buccal smear , L3-index &amp; atherosclerosis measurement CT-scans , SNAQ &amp; MUST score</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictive Factors Anastomotic Leakage After Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) fourth common cause cancer death worldwide , estimate responsible 610,000 death 20081 . The number CRC patient concomitantly increase due high incidence , population growth , age population recently establish nationwide screening . Surgery remain predominant curative treatment type CRC , major impact patient 's wellbeing demand large amount metabolic reserve . This lead development frequently observe severe postoperative complication . Anastomotic leakage ( AL ) important complication colorectal surgery incidence 8-15 % Netherlands . AL associate high short-term mortality rate 40 % . Even though many attempt make prevent dreaded complication , none intervention successful far . Despite proper patient selection , reduction know preoperative risk factor improve surgical technique well introduction 'fast track ' protocol , AL incidence decrease past decade ( ) . AL associate decreased disease-specific survival increase recurrence rate CRC . The aim study investigate potential strategy prevent AL , able diagnose AL time therefore start treatment early possible process . The etiology anastomotic healing human gastrointestinal tract fully elucidate . Risk factor associate anastomotic leakage identify , patient characteristic ( age , malnutrition , tumor distally localize ) surgical factor ( insufficient perfusion anastomosis , tension anastomosis ) . Previous study perform surgical research department School Nutrition , Toxicology Metabolism ( NUTRIM ) focus risk factor individually . We reveal consequence intestinal ischemia small large human intestine unique experimental model describe recovery mechanism intestine ischemic injury . The crucial role Mannose Binding Lectin ( MBL ) , important complement factor immune system show well fact small proteins present mature enterocytes ( Intestinal-Fatty Acid Binding Proteins , I-FABP ) act adequate marker plasma intestinal damage13-14 . Furthermore , use cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) knockout mouse , show COX-2 essential healing process colonic anastomosis ( manuscript submit ) . Another previous study show frailty ( define Groningen Frailty Index , sarcopenia ( determine measure skeletal muscle mass L3 level CT-scan ) malnutrition ( assess Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire ( SNAQ ) en Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool ( MUST ) ) associate occurrence sepsis mortality 273 patient . In pilot study 90 patient , preoperative I-FABP plasma level postoperative inflammatory plasma concentration ( C-reactive protein &amp; calprotectin ) identify predictive marker anastomotic leakage elective colorectal surgery . In addition , composition volatile organic compound ( VOCs ) exhale breath varies depend health status . Various metabolic process within body produce volatile product release blood pass airway blood reach lung . Moreover , occurrence chronic inflammation and/or oxidative stress result excretion volatile compound generate unique VOC pattern . In study , measure total amount VOCs exhale air , see eligible tool early clinical diagnosis anastomotic leakage . Based result , aim combine translate observational result individual study one multicentre prospective study several aspect anastomotic leakage investigate . With result study , expect able provide patient adequate risk estimation regard anastomotic leakage . This help surgeon make decision create stoma instead perform primary anastomosis detect anastomotic leakage earlier stage . Furthermore , study may provide new insight lead potential new treatment .</detailed_description>
