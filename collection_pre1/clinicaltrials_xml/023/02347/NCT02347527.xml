	<detailed_description>One factor may contribute susceptibility obesity high responsivity high-calorie food term cognitive factor emotional association , reward value reinforce property food . Many process involve learn association think develop via classical conditioning repeat pairing external stimulus , influence food preference intake . As , improve understanding neuronal mechanism underlie process attempt modify may useful strategy promote weight loss maintenance . Therefore , propose study aim investigate effect alter food perception neuronal response food intake behavior use implicit priming , positively negatively valenced image present immediately prior food image , consciously perceive . The project goal determine impact implicit prim intervention brain response food cue food intake behavior overweight/obese individual . Food image rating neuronal response visual food cue assess either ( ) active implicit prim intervention ( b ) control intervention . Following fMRI , food intake measure .</detailed_description>
