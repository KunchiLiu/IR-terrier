	<detailed_description>Concurrent chemoradiotherapy recommend therapeutic approach patient unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , although surgery offer chance cure . With combined-modality therapy radiation therapy chemotherapy , prognosis stage III NSCLC remain poor . Gefitinib show great efficacy NSCLC patient EGFR mutation . This study study neoadjuvant gefitinib follow surgery , follow adjuvant gefitinib see well work treat patient unresectable EGFR mutant stage III NSCLC .</detailed_description>
