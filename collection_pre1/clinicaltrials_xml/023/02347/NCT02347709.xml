	<detailed_description>Neuropathy common complication diabetes see 43 % patient diabetes . The relationship neuropathy diabetic low extremity wound strong fact , 80 % patient exist diabetic foot ulcer ( DFU ) neuropathy . Understanding factor contribute increase risk wound patient neuropathy important create optimal strategy reduce risk . Traditionally , severity diabetic neuropathy evaluate use clinical exam nerve conduction study . More recently , new technique intra-epidermal nerve fiber density show promise evaluate neuropathy especially small nerve fiber neuropathy might affect pain sensation autonomic function . There also new molecular marker may correlate risk neuropathy may also useful clinically evaluate diabetic patient neuropathy . The primary purpose study determine degree loss epidermal nerve fiber near foot wound patient diabetic foot ulcer . The secondary purpose determine whether degree epidermal nerve fiber loss , clinical examination , nerve conduction study molecular profile correlate appearance low extremity ulcer patient diabetes .</detailed_description>
