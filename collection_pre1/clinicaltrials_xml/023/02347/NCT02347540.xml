	<brief_summary>This study cross-sectional case-control study classical well innovative risk factor CVD explore . In western country , woman men die cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , make CVD woman important public health issue . Misdiagnosis CVD woman frequently observe , pose clinician diagnostic therapeutic dilemma easily result inadequate treatment bad prognosis . Despite challenge , CVD woman underexpose scientific research . Women gender-specific risk factor like history preeclampsia ( PE ) contribute risk CVD . PE complicate 5-10 % pregnancy , recurs ~25 % associate 2-4 fold increase risk CVD . Moreover , pre-symptomatic heart failure ( HF ) stage B occur 40 % woman history PE . HF stage B think precede development , mortality relate , clinical HF stage C D ( structural heart disease combination symptomatic disease ) . Early detection tailor intervention woman stage B HF decrease progression clinical stage might therefore improve clinical outcome cardiovascular relate mortality . Phenotypic presentation HF currently split systolic HF also call HF reduce ejection fraction ( HFrEF ) diastolic HF HF preserve ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) . Women often HFpEF contrast men . Different pathophysiology disease progression woman compare men seem important underlying factor . The current clinical HF diagnostic tool ( e.g . natriuretic hormone high sensitivity troponins ) fail identify early change prelude adverse cardiac remodelling HF , discriminate HFrEF HFpEF . Moreover , sex-related difference biomarker level detection CVD . As result , clinician force wait fail heart become clinically evident intervene . Therefore , urgent need ass novel biomarkers could help select high risk woman need follow intervention . Biomarkers may improve early diagnosis may also unravel disease pathway HFpEF . Especially combined measurement subclinical , surrogate risk marker . Objectives - To determine impact PE incidence macro-and micro-vascular dysfunction reflect surrogate measure coronary artery disease ( CAD ) HFpEF . - To perform genome wide association study ( GWAS ) associate novel biomarker expression level endothelial function , cardiac diastolic function IMT measurement . - To identify risk factor surrogate measure CVD ) former PE patient without HFpEF , b ) former PE patient HFpEF c ) healthy parous control . Study population Cases : woman history PE Controls : woman uncomplicated pregnancy history . Measurements perform cluster postpartum interval : ½-2 , 5-10 , 10-15 15-30 year . Number inclusion : 425 , 350 , 282 233 follow-up group respectively . Primary endpoint The prevalence macro- microvascular dysfunction former PE patient . Novel biomarker detection former PE patient associate HF general HFpEF particular . Secondary endpoint - Lifestyle ( questionnaire ) - Cognitive ability ( questionnaire ) - Depression score ( questionnaire ) - Metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) - Arterial endothelial function ( Flow mediate dilation ( FMD ) ) - Intima Media Thickness ( IMT ) - Glycocalyx thickness ( mean Glycocheck ) - Venous function ( plethysmograph ) - Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) - Ergometry</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Cases Women age ≥ 18 year ½ till 30 year complicate pregnancy Experienced PE pregnancy . PE define hypertension ( systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg ) develop 20 week pregnancy development proteinuria ( ≥ 300 mg/ 24 hour ) . Women last delivery least 6 month ago . Controls Women age ≥ 18 year ½ till 30 year pregnancy match sequence number pregnancy specifically match case . Experienced pregnancy complicate foetal maternal placental syndrome ( pregnancy induce hypertension , preeclampsia , HELLPsyndrome ) . Women last pregnancy least 6 month ago . Women negative family history PE ( mother sister experience PE ) . A potential subject meet follow criterion exclude participation study : Cases Women autoimmune diseases prior complicate pregnancy . Chronic hypertension prior complicate pregnancy . Renal disease prior complicate pregnancy . Pregnant woman Women want informed result test , woman want general practitioner specialist ( ) inform test result . Control group : Women autoimmune diseases Chronic hypertension prior matched pregnancy . Women IUGR match pregnancy ( p &lt; 10 ) Preterm delivery match pregnancy ( gestational age &lt; 37 week ) Solutio placenta match pregnancy Pregnant woman Women want informed result test , woman want general practitioner specialist ( ) inform test result .</criteria>
