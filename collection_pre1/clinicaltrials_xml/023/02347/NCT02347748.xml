Purpose : To investigate impact comfort talk level pre-induction anxiety , procedural recovery experience , well short-term post-procedural behaviour satisfaction discharge pediatric patient undergoing cardiac catheterization procedure . Design : Prospective randomized , double blind control trial . Participants : 160 child , age 7-18 year , cardiac catheterization procedure general anaesthesia . Intervention : Group A read pre-procedure comfort talk script pre-procedure work-up area ; Group B read pre-extubation ( breathe tube remove ) script ; Group C read pre-procedure plus pre-extubation script ; Group D read script . All group treat accord standard care approach usually provide anaesthesia , catheterization , recovery . Outcomes : We compare effect script strategy preoperative anxiety . Procedural recovery measurement include room time catheterization suite , time discharge recovery room ; drug use , vomit , rebleeds , cardiorespiratory stability . Postoperative behaviour assess questionnaire . Postoperative anxiety pain secondary outcome measure use query 0-10 verbal self-report scale Hypotheses : 1 .
