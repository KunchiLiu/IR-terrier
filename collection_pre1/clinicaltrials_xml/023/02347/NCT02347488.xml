	<brief_title>Endotracheal Tube Holder Bite Guard Research</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endotracheal tube ( ETT ) secure surgery ICU care accidentally remove airway . The position tip ETT important must vary much within trachea . The standard technique secure ETT use tape attach upper lip face . The technique cheap simple , suffers certain drawback . First , upper lip mobile thus even well secure , tube move within trachea due mobility . Second , condition face sweat , drool , facial hair , skin flake breakdown , interfere ability tape adhere , thus reduce efficacy . Furthermore , tape irritate injure facial skin . The adhesive irritates skin certain patient allergic substance . Also , remove tape physically damage skin , especially skin vulnerable sheer force ( elderly patient patient systemic steroid ) . Patients intubate often need bite block bite guard insert mouth . This serve two main purpose : 1 ) prevent patient bite ETT occlude airflow , 2 ) prevent patient bite tongue , cheek , lips cause injury . Furthermore , endoscopic procedure often perform intubated patient thus bite block need protect delicate instrument bitten damage . For reason , many provider insert bite block mouth intubate patient . Many device exist market , commonly use Guedel oral airway . This device actually design increase airway patency mask ventilation , long term use device bite block link numerous complication include : 1 ) tongue swelling , often compromise airway patency , 2 ) tooth damage , 3 ) lip injury . Because shortcoming , specific ETT bite block develop , even double ETT securing device . However , usually make hard , stiff material injure delicate oral structure . In summation , single device serf ergonomic ETT holder bite block successfully develop market , therefore standard care remain tape plus oral airway . The Haider airway combination ETT holder-securing device bite block . Made soft silicone rubber , device engineer ground serve purpose safety comfort mind . The device FDA approve pre-marketing trial phase determine efficacy product specific clinical scenario . Our institution task test device clinical scenario tape + oral airway historically problematic . We plan compare new device tape + oral airway , current standard care neurosurgical patient supine position . We hypothesize device superior standard care efficacy patient comfort .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age â‰¥ 18 year General anesthesia require oral endotracheal intubation prone position duration surgery ( head secure foam head holder , horseshoe frame , Mayfield pin ) . General anesthesia neurosurgery require oral endotracheal intubation , supine slight lateral bump position duration surgery . ( Special emphasis place include patient undergo motor evoke potential , thus paralyze surgery ) .
