	<brief_summary>LAY SUMMARY Clostridium Difficile ( C.difficile ) bacterial infection cause inflammation colon , ( C.difficile colitis ) . This sometimes progress sudden severe illness . The present treatment fulminant colitis total abdominal colectomy end ileostomy . This mean , surgery perform remove entire diseased colon . The end small intestine bring front abdomen stoma , patient wear bag . Despite invasive treatment , remain significant rate death ( 38-50 % ) . In addition , patient long recovery long operation many ( 67 % ) fit second big operation remove stoma ( reconnect intestine ) . The purpose study determine loop ileostomy colonic lavage result well outcome . A loop ileostomy loop small intestine bring abdomen colon remain abdomen . The diseased colon , preserve , wash warm solution ( like solution use colonoscopy preparation ) treat antibiotic via ileostomy . So far , one study do use loop ileostomy colonic lavage . 42 patient underwent treatment compare 42 patient underwent standard care ( complete removal colon end ileostomy ) . The 42 patient underwent loop ileostomy show significant decrease rate death compare standard care . Also , study , patient underwent loop ileostomy much high rate reconnection intestine ( close stoma ) . The purpose study see loop ileostomy colonic lavage treat patient fulminant colitis less risk death standard care . Once patient diagnose fulminant colitis meet eligibility criterion , he/she ask surgeon on-call would like participate research study . If agree study , must first sign consent form . They may ask surgeon enroll either investigational arm ( loop ileostomy ) standard care arm . After surgery , patient receive standard routine care . During hospital stay , information take chart purpose study . Routine follow visit surgeon 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 month surgery . If patient decides study , patient expect complete follow study visit . The patient require anything extra extra test decide study visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Loop Ileostomy With Colonic Lavage Fulminant Clostridium Difficile Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL 1 . Study purpose rationale . Specific Aim Hypothesis : The objective study determine loop ileostomy colonic irrigation reduces 30 day all-cause mortality compare current standard care fulminant Clostridium difficile colitis ( FCDC ) , total abdominal colectomy end ileostomy . We hypothesize loop ileostomy colonic irrigation ( ileostomy ) significantly reduce 30 day all-cause mortality compare total abdominal colectomy end ileostomy ( TAC ) . Furthermore , hypothesize intervention reduce 30-day morbidity , 90 day all-cause mortality improve gastrointestinal restoration rate compare TAC . ii . Significance : With emergence hypervirulent toxin-producing NAP1/027 strain C. difficile 2003 , C.difficile colitis become increasingly common problem ( 1 ) . Up 10 % patient C.difficile infection progress FCDC mortality 36-80 % ( 1-3 ) . The standard care FCDC timely TAC ; however despite intervention mortality rate remain high ( 38-55 % ) ( 2,3 ) . The standard care FCDC TAC . This include end ileostomy , become permanent 65 % patient reversal necessitates extensive operation ( 5 ) . Neal et al . propose new surgical approach FCDC include creation loop ileostomy , intraoperative colonic lavage warm polyethylene glycol via ileostomy postoperative antegrade instillation vancomycin flush diseased colon via ileostomy . In single-institution series , alternative approach 42 patient compare 42 historical control underwent TAC ( 4 ) . While demographic severity illness control intervention group comparable , 30 day mortality significantly decrease ileostomy compare TAC group ( 19 % vs. 50 % ) . To date , report new alternative procedure FCDC . Neal et al . 's work single center , single surgeon series loop ileostomy case compare historical series patient treat TAC . To investigate promising result innovative treatment , propose multi-center national ( Canadian ) prospective cohort study evaluation intervention compare control . 2 . Description study population . Basic study design : This national , multi-center prospective cohort study evaluate loop ileostomy colonic lavage standard care , total abdominal colectomy end ileostomy . This study consist prospective registry ( 2014 2017 ) 2 prospective arm : loop ileostomy group control ( TAC ) group . In addition , concurrently perform retrospective chart review participate site ( 2010 2014 ) serve third group historical control . Study population assembly patient : Subjects draw 20 participate adult , tertiary Canadian hospital . All patient Clostridium difficile infection evaluate surgery eligible study . Subject identification carry attend surgeon call , eligibility evaluate , patient approach study participation . Consent study obtain subject legally authorize representative ( legal representative must court-appointment mandatory , curator tutor ) . Vulnerable patient pre-existing incapacity consent legally authorize representative exclude . In contrast , subject may late presentation FCDC therefore may lack physical mental capacity provide independent informed consent . At time , consent study obtain next kin ( next kin define Civil Code Québec ) . When subject recovers , consent obtain him/her time . Enrolment trial accordance Civil Code Québec ( article 15 , 20 , 21 ) ( 6 ) QC notation . As disease process surgery occur emergency basis , surgeon on-call ( pre-determined hospital 's call schedule ) ass patient he/she invite patient enrol study . The decision undergo loop ileostomy TAC leave discretion surgeon patient . In either case , patient give option enrol study either investigational arm ( loop ileostomy ) control arm ( TAC ) . We concurrently perform retrospective chart review participate site 01/2010 01/2014 serve historical comparative control group ( 180 patient estimate ) . These patient identify hospital database discharge procedure code . Chart review conduct use inclusion exclusion criterias use prospective patient . The stable nature incidence C.difficile infection Canada since 2009 well-established standard surgical approach ( TAC ) FCDC ( 6 ) justify comparison historical control . 3 . Sample size determine We estimate 60 colectomies FCDC perform per year ( 20 institution ) ( 5 ) . Neal et al . report absolute risk reduction 31 % 30 day mortality . However , give single surgeon experience current 30-day mortality 38 % ( 5 ) ( contrast 50 % TAC Neal et al . 's series ) , anticipate absolute risk reduction 22 % . For reduction , type I error rate 0.05 , power 80 % , 1:1 control intervention ratio , 63 patient required arm , estimate accrue 2 year . We also cluster surgeon institution , however surgeon institution expect contribute ( approximately 1-3 ) case , estimate small intraclass correlation coefficient design effect close 1 . 4 . Design description methodology i. Exposures measurement : The exposure treatment strategy . The intervention evaluate loop ileostomy intra-operative colonic lavage . Ileostomy colonic lavage consider standard care institution . Patients manage ileostomy colonic lavage respond expect may convert TAC , intra- post-operatively , discretion surgeon . These patient analyze ileostomy group ( similar intention treat analysis ) since original treatment strategy assign . A subgroup analysis patient convert TAC , impact overall result , also examine . ii . Confounders measurement : Fortunately , FCDC manage emergency basis ; thus surgeon on-call ( base on-call schedule ) one care patient patient choose surgeon , surgeon choose patient . This eliminate referral bias , , surgeon assignment consider random bias different surgeon treat different type patient . All general colorectal surgeon equally qualify make clinical decision operate FCDC ( inclusion criterion study ) perform propose operation , TAC loop ileostomy . However , individual surgeon bias may exist towards one procedure . This examine short qualitative questionnaire request rationale choice operation . Due infrequency operation FCDC need recruit multiple participate surgeon , surgeon may contribute 1-3 patient . Variability individual institution clinical practice account cluster surgeon institution analysis . Institution surgeon variability may introduce may reflect difference technical skill , hospital infrastructure , degree adoption early surgical consultation FCDC , operate room availability . Due severity FCDC require surgery critically ill nature patient reach prior surgical consultation , patient population enter trial relatively homogenous . This remarkable homogeneity within patient population present surgical management FCDC observe hospital ( 2,5 ) Neal et al . 's study ( 4 ) . Nonetheless , anticipate account confound patient factor analysis include old age , immunosuppression , elevate pre-op white blood cell count , lactate , intubation vasopressor ( 2,3,5 ) . Earlier time surgery associate improved survival may also confounder surgeon may incline offer loop ileostomy lavage earlier would offer TAC give minimally invasive nature . Similarly due new intervention 's less invasive nature , old patient co-morbidities may incline consent surgery would offer TAC ; introduce confound indication . 5 . Definition end-points The primary outcome 30 day all-cause mortality . This binary outcome suitable report outcome FCDC . The secondary outcome : 1 ) 30 day morbidity , composite binary outcome include Clavien-Dindo grade 2-5 ( serious ) complication ( 6 ) also include death ( Clavien grade 5 ) ; 2 ) 90 day all-cause mortality ( binary ) order capture survive first month long complicate hospitalization poor outcome ; 3 ) restoration gastrointestinal continuity ileostomy closure ( binary ) serve surrogate excellent recovery ; 4 ) length hospital stay , censor outcome , use time discharge outcome censor death ( patient die hospitalization contribute towards length stay day survive ) . 6 . Measurements study instrument ( include questionnaire , data collection form , etc ) Prospective data collection perform hospitalization daily 30 day , patient follow 3 , 6 12 month post-operatively phone follow-up . If time point coincide visit surgeon 's office , data collect time . The patient require extra test hospital visit participate study 7 . Data analysis plan The distribution measure variable assess graphically diagnostics . Descriptive variable confounders compare ileostomy TAC group use two sample t-tests , Wilcoxon rank sum , fisher exact test normal , right-skewed categorical variable , respectively . A logistic regression model predict exposure ( TAC vs. ileostomy ) create potential confounders outline ( surgeon patient factor ) propensity score create individual . A logistic regression model fit main outcome , main predictor intervention , propensity score include second co-variate control confound . Alternatively , may choose match propensity score . The impact ileostomy mortality express odds ratio ( 95 % CI ) . Secondary analysis ( consider exploratory ) compare 30 day morbidity , 90 day all-cause mortality , length hospital stay rate GI restoration ileostomy TAC . A subgroup analysis perform ileostomy patient convert TAC . The historical control arm analyze separately similar group compare . 8 . Recruitment procedure include copy advertisement ; Subject identification carry attend surgeon call , eligibility evaluate , patient approach study participation . A consent study obtain subject legally authorize representative . As disease process surgery occur emergency basis , surgeon on-call ( pre-determined hospital 's call schedule ) ass patient he/she invite patient enrol study . The decision undergo loop ileostomy TAC leave discretion surgeon patient . In either case , patient give option enrol study either investigational arm ( loop ileostomy ) control arm ( TAC ) . The patient give consent form soon identify potential candidate surgeon-on-call . Once patient and/or legal representative sign consent form , patient consider accrue study . Details confidentiality Patient data link hospital ID number study ID number . Once patient complete follow-up period , hospital ID number remove de-identified . The data maintain secure web-based registry ( Redcap ) . This use research team always access password protect hospital computer . The data keep de-identified manner 5 year follow study completion . The study conduct accord ethical principle state Declaration Helsinki ( 2013 ) , ethic approval obtain initiate study . Also , consent form take consideration well-being , free-will respect participant , include respect privacy .</detailed_description>
