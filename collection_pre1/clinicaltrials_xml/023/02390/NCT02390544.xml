	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) melphalan child undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . Melphalan important component HSCT preparative regimen , associate significant toxicity . PK data powerful clinical tool , use develop individualized treatment plan specific patient , may ultimately increase likelihood select right dose right patient and/or reduce number adverse drug event . The investigator ' goal establish baseline pediatric melphalan PK data . These data may use patient specific dose melphalan future minimize toxicity improve transplant outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Study Melphalan Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) continue curative therapy patient many hematological disease . The adverse effect associate chemotherapy agent use part HSCT preparative regimen insignificant life threaten time . The investigator ' central hypothesis increase systemic exposure melphalan due variation PK young child lead increase toxicity see . Although PK melphalan study animal model adult patient , limited data exists pediatric patient especially undergo allogeneic HSCT . The objective study describe pharmacokinetics melphalan child undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Up forty patient schedule receive melphalan part preparative regimen enrol . Prior start preparative regimen , study participant receive test dose melphalan ( 10 % standard dose ) . Blood sample collect specific time point prior administration test dose around full standard dose melphalan . This study establish novel method ( dry blood spot assay ) determine PK melphalan utilized clinical setting . Additionally , urine sample collect measure marker kidney injury , help correlate melphalan exposure toxicity .</detailed_description>
