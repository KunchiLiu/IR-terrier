	<brief_summary>The goal project use low-level light therapy ( LLLT ) enhance neural metabolism prefrontal cortex human , measure effect LLLT attentional bias change follow single session attention bias modification ( ABM ) . LLLT non-invasive , therapeutically beneficial , promotes wide range biological effect include enhancement energy production , gene expression prevention cell death . Previous research indicate human participant show beneficial psychological effect , include improve mood great sustain attention , follow single treatment LLLT forehead . ABM computer-based cognitive task design decrease mood-congruent negative attentional bias frequently observe depressed dysphoric individual . Previous ABM study lead decrease clinical symptom relative control condition . This study explore whether effect LLLT mood attention could improve potency ABM , lead great attention change great improvement mood relative sham LLLT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Low-level light therapy constitutes novel intervention show regulate neuronal function cell culture , animal model , clinical condition ( Eells et al. , 2004 ) . The Gonzalez-Lima lab previously show low-level light therapy increase mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase activity , provide neuroprotection toxicity ( Rojas et al. , 2008 ; Rojas Gonzalez-Lima , 2010 ) improve aerobic capacity tissue skeletal muscle ( Hayworth et al . 2010 ) . This suggest oxidative metabolism tissue expose LLLT enhance . LLLT treatment also appear vivo transcranial neurochemical effect involve metabolic-enhancing antioxidant system ; non-invasive technique use human stimulate brain antidepressant treatment ( Schiffer et al. , 2009 ) , alleviate muscle fatigue enhance recovery ( Leal Junior et al. , 2010 ) , increase sustain attention cognitive task ( Barrett &amp; Gonzalez-Lima , press ) . These LLLT treatment thus proven safe actually beneficial human . Collectively , data imply LLLT could use inexpensive , noninvasive approach boost blood flow energy consumption brain tissue , well provide neuroprotection neurological condition may relate mitochondrial dysfunction . This research could ultimately lead development non-invasive , non-pharmacologic , therapeutic , cytoprotective performance-enhancing intervention healthy human need rehabilitation effort condition neuromuscular function movement compromise , well treat neurobiological disorder metabolic dysfunction play underlie causal role , depression post-traumatic stress disorder . The therapeutic use red near-infrared light wavelength base principle certain molecule live system absorb photon trigger signal pathway response light . In biologic tissue , absorption scatter light ( would render ineffective treatment ) maximal wavelength 600 nanometer , water absorbs light wavelength great 1150 nanometer . Thus , `` wavelength window '' biologic stimulation cover red near-infrared light spectrum ( 600 1150 nm ) ( Hamblin Demidova , 2006 ) . Early result suggest LLLT may significant promise treatment clinical disorder . Schiffer et al . ( 2009 ) find single LLLT treatment forehead result increased cerebral blood flow significant beneficial effect patient major depression anxiety . Previous research conduct Gonzalez-Lima lab show healthy human subject receive LLLT show significantly higher positive affect two week follow-up session relative subject `` placebo-light '' condition ( Barrett &amp; Gonzalez-Lima , 2014 ) . Importantly , adverse side effect find subject either study , either immediately initial treatment , two four week post-treatment . We plan follow LLLT treatment protocol two study , immediately prior run subject ABM procedure . ABM technique design modify attentional bias , cognitive factor theorize underlie onset maintenance Major Depressive Disorder ( Wells &amp; Beevers , 2010 ; Beck , 1987 ) . ABM build framework standard dot-probe task , wherein two valenced stimulus present side-by-side , follow target probe behind one stimulus . The difference response time probe directly behind stimuli relative probe opposite side stimulus use operationalize attentional bias particular valence stimulus . ABM use condition approach shift bias staggering frequency probe distribution favor one specific valence . Eventually , participant expect preferentially process favor valence stimulus , lead shift attentional bias . This placebo-controlled study measure whether LLLT influence efficacy ABM measure bias attention dysphoria . Participants randomize receive either active placebo LLLT , undergo ABM procedure design decrease attention towards negative environmental stimulus ( measure use variant dot-probe task ) . The combination LLLT ABM take place two session ( two day apart ) , follow one two week follow-up period assess mood change . We hypothesize participant receive active LLLT show great change attentional bias follow ABM great decrease dysphoric symptoms follow-up compare placebo group .</detailed_description>
