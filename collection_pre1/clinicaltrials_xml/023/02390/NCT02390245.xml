	<brief_summary>Our goal conduct 5-year prospective , randomize control trial test innovative , community-based intervention use posterior anterior fundus photography optic nerve macular image improve access utilization eye care detect , treat , manage high-risk patient previously undiagnosed glaucoma eye disease . Research show subject failure attend follow-up eye care appointment diminish previous benefit community screening glaucoma . Greater adherence follow-up visit reduce glaucomatous blindness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Philadelphia Telemedicine Glaucoma Detection Follow-Up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project divide follow part : - Phase 1 consist recruit approximately 900 patient primary care office federally qualify health center across Philadelphia Chester county . Using telemedicine , detect eye disease Visit 1 , follow comprehensive eye exam glaucoma specialist primary care set confirm diagnosis ( Visit 2 ) . Based preliminary data , 50 % patient abnormal optic nerve and/or macular image . The predictive accuracy optic nerve image detect glaucoma , glaucoma suspect eye disease confirm comprehensive eye exam evaluate . - Phase 2 involve consenting , enrol , randomize 343 patient either usual care group ( n=171 ) enhance intervention group ( n=172 ) schedule follow-up eye exam local , general ophthalmologist office-based setting ( Visit 3 ) . The enhanced intervention consist use patient navigator social worker reduce barrier follow-up eye care . - Phase 3 involve follow patient proximal ( 1-2 month ) distal ( 3 year ) follow-up care appointment ( Visits 3-8 ) local ophthalmologist . Adherence follow-up recommendation eye care primary outcome measure . A comprehensive cost study estimate intervention cost cost-effectiveness detect eye disease vision impairment high-risk population also conduct . Protocols , material , result disseminate organization , stakeholder community order expand detection glaucoma , eye disease , visual impairment , refine approach .</detailed_description>
