	<brief_summary>Glaucoma progressive disease result blindness . Determining onset disease , predict severity benefit pressure lower eye drop key clinical management aim maintain useful vision advance age . This study longitudinally monitor population glaucoma suspect ( positive factor disease normal vision ) noninvasive pattern electroretinogram ( PERG ) standard eye test glaucoma . The PERG measure function retinal ganglion cell ( RGCs ) parent neuron optic nerve . RGCs may become dysfunctional die function restore pressure-lowering eye drop . Glaucoma suspect abnormal PERG randomize treatment eye drop , normal PERG leave untreated . All patient monitor PERG , Optic Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) ancillary test every 6 month 4 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The PERG record small metallic button tap skin similarly electrocardiogram , difference electrode around eye . The physical contact experience gentle cleaning skin alcohol prep pad . During test must look eye Television ( TV ) display 3 minute . During follow period may ask take one PERG test lie bed . This cause momentary increase eye pressure similar one occur normal sleep . This may help understand whether optic nerve function normally pressure eye increase . For OCT evaluation , pupil dilate drop eye exam . You briefly look mark inside instrument one eye time . PERG OCT perform day visit eye doctor . If already do test past , part another study part standard treatment , result test obtain record , include study . If participant Observation Group , monitor PERG , OCT , standard clinical examination every six month close study . If participant Medication Group also treat eye drop medicine . RISKS : There certain risk discomfort may associate research . You aware risk develop glaucoma whether participate study . It know whether risk develop glaucoma reduce eye drop low eye pressure ; study attempt answer question . For PERG , significant risk small chance rash cleanse agent skin electrode , go away without treatment . For OCT , rare risk allergic reaction drop use dilate pupil . The risk even low reaction previous eye exam . In case allergic reaction , eye doctor immediately treat . If previous problem pupil dilation , may wish speak eye doctor option additional test .</detailed_description>
