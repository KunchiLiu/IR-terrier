	<brief_title>Rituximab Lenalidomide v Rituximab Alone Maintenance After R-Bendamustine Relapsed/Refractory FL Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among Non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) , Follicular Lymphoma ( FL ) second one term frequency , account 25 % NHL case western hemisphere . A predominance female report , median age diagnosis 60 year . FL cell originate normal counterpart germinal B cell . At molecular level , pathology think dependent multiple DNA alteration . However , large amount patient ( approximately 85 % ) ( 14 ; 18 ) , consequent overexpression anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 . An additional hallmark pathology bone marrow involvement ( 70 % patient ) , seldom noticed organ . Finally , 20 % patient show high level serum lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) and/or B symptom . FL actually consider incurable disease . Although FL respond well initial chemotherapy , patient eventually relapse , require multiple subsequent therapeutic regimen course disease achieve new period remission , nevertheless shorter . Relapsed/refractory FL advance stage , especially old patient , relatively poor prognosis , several patient die infectious complication and/or progressive disease . This subset patient usually survive 5 year . Thus need new , less toxic active treatment particular patient recurrent disease . The addition Rituximab chemotherapy show clear benefit term overall response rate , quality response , event-free survival , study , overall survival ; nevertheless , relapse still occur . Moreover Rituximab also prove highly effective employed maintenance treatment either follow chemotherapy Rituximab-supplemented chemotherapy . The success Rituximab maintenance lead widespread opinion context indolent lymphoma novel `` smart '' drug characterize good safety profile need carefully evaluate induction also maintenance set . Autologous stem cell transplantation radioimmunotherapy therapeutic option relapsed/refractory FL patient , consider young fit patient deliver large institution . Therefore search new , manageable , therapeutic agent different mechanism action , especially elderly frail patient , ongoing . Bendamustine highly effective relapsed/refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) Mantle Cell Lymphoma ( MCL ) , include patient refractory rituximab previously treat alkylating agent . Therefore , bendamustine widely use set provide another effective treatment option patient progress CHOP-R. Two phase II study combine bendamustine ( 90 mg/m2 day 2-3 every 28 day ) rituximab ( 375 mg/m2 day 1 ) report similar result . The overall response rate 90 % ( 60 % CR ) entire patient population , median Progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient 24 month . Based encouraging result relapsed/refractory setting , Study group indolent Lymphomas ( StiL ) initiate large , randomize , phase III trial bendamustine ( 90 mg/m2 day 1-2 every 28 day ) plus rituximab ( 375 mg/m2 day 1 ) . This trial compare B-R standard CHOP-R ( 21-day cycle ) previously untreated patient indolent NHL MCL . 549 patient predominantly stage IV disease enrol , treatment group well balance baseline characteristic . Approximately 55 % patient FL , approximately 20 % MCL , remain 25 % indolent lymphoma . Although overall response rate similar B-R CHOP-R arm ( 93.8 % 93.5 % , respectively ) , CR rate significantly high B-R arm ( 40.1 % compare 30.8 % CHOP-R ; P .03 ) , median PFS significantly longer B-R arm ( 54.8 month v 34.8 month CHOP-R ; P .0002 ) . No difference survival observe thus far , follow-up ongoing study require address whether B-R improve survival compare CHOP-R . Nevertheless , bendamustine plus rituximab yield durable response improve PFS compare CHOP-R previously untreated patient indolent lymphoma . Moreover , bendamustine plus rituximab well tolerate . Lenalidomide immunomodulatory agent multiple mechanisms action wich include antiproliferative activity well microenvironmental effect inhibition angiogenesis stimulation T-cell mediate response . Lenalidomide give monotherapy prove active , acceptable toxicity profile , B-cell malignancies multiple myeloma , chronic lymphocytic leukemia , mantle cell lymphoma diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . Recent report Lenalidomide FL , untreated relapsed patient , promise . Forty-three patient relapse refractory indolent non Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) treat oral Lenalidomide 25 mg daily day 1 21 every 28-day cycle 52 week progression . Twenty-two 43 patient enrol FL In subgroup overall response rate 27 % , 9 % complete remission rate . Most common adverse event myelosuppression , fatigue , gastrointestinal event cutaneous rash , predominant grade 3/4 serious adverse event neutropenia thrombocytopenia . Despite median duration response longer 16.5 month , disappoint median progression-free survival 4.4 month . Witzig et al . focus Lenalidomide 25 mg monotherapy relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma . The cohort patient 217 , 19 stage III FL . Regarding patient subset , ORR 42 % , CR/Cru 11 % , median PFS 8.9 month , median duration response reach . The cytotoxic effect Rituximab appear involve CDC , ADCC induction apoptosis . Early study Lenalidomide show potential high CR rate long duration response FL Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . Recent data suggest modulation effector cell Lenalidomide enhance antitumor activity Rituximab partially overcome resistance cell line relapsed/refractory NHL . Lenalidomide appear fact greatly enhance monocyte NK-mediated ADCC exert Rituximab , result increase cancer cell kill compare single drug . A synergistic activity Rituximab Lenalidomide report vitro lymphoma cell animal model . Rituximab-lenalidomide ( R2 ) combination consequently test clinical trial , include untreated relapsed/refractory indolent NHL , encourage result . The first report R2 combination FL present 51th ASH meeting Dutia M et al . Sixteen patient relapsed/refractory indolent NHL treat R2 combination , obtain 75 % overall response ( ORR ) rate acceptable toxicity ; interestingly , efficacy data seem good FL patient 88 % ORR . Moreover , unfavourable subgroup rituximab refractory heavily pre-treated patient , ORR rate 57 % 70 % , respectively . Estimated progression-free survival patient 12 month . The major limitation study small number patient , 9 FL patient include study . Twenty-four patient indolent B-cell lymphoma , previously resistant Rituximab , receive Rituximab-Lenalidomide +/- Dexamethasone combination progression disease unacceptable toxicity ; Lenalidomide administer dosage 10 mg , 28 day per course . 28 45 patient FL . No FL group analysis report , study allow ass also patient resistant Rituximab mono-therapy benefit R2 , without Dexamethasone , achieve high ORR ( ~61 % ) relatively durable response . One hundred patient stage III-IV untreated indolent NHL receive R2 combination cycle 28 day ( Lenalidomide 20 mg orally day day 1 day 21 Rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously day 1 ) . 49 patient ( 49 % ) compose FL subset . The outcome FL patient extremely positive , consider ORR ( 98 % ) CR/CRu ( 85 % ) . Moreover , R2 treatment prolong 6 course , significant improvement see CR/CRu . Finally , PFS 83 % FL patient 24 month , toxicity profile acceptable . In CALGB 50401 randomize study 89 recurrent FL patient treat Lenalidomide alone versus R2 combination . ORR 49 % vs 75 % EFS 1.2 v 2.0 median follow 1.5 year . Basing promise data , trial propose combination Lenalidomide R-CHOP ( R2-CHOP ) , R-CHOP standard treatment patient B-cell lymphoma . Briefly , Phase I Phase I/II trial confirm potential novel combination , although large multi-centre trial require confirm result .</detailed_description>
