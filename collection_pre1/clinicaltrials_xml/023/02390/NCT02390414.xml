	<brief_title>The Myelodysplasia Transplantation-Associated Outcomes ( MDS-TAO ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MDS hematologic malignancy characterize cytopenia , bone marrow failure , risk transformation acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . HSCT curative therapy MDS . Despite increase use among old patient ( age great 60 ) , data need ass outcome HSCT old adult compare therapy . In observational study , patient MDS present study institution screen disease characteristic indicate potentially appropriate HSCT ( high-risk disease fit procedure ) . Patients meet inclusion exclusion criterion agree participate study enter clinical database follow overall survival . Patients also complete quality life ( QoL ) assessments enrollment two year afterward , goal investigate potential relationship QoL MDS treatment ( HSCT vs. non-HSCT strategy ) .</detailed_description>
