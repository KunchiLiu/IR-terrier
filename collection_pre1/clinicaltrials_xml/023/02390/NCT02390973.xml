	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery procedure induce weight loss restriction and/or malabsorption . The mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes remission others metabolic improvement Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass ( RYGB ) , sleeve gastrectomy ( SG ) biliopancreatic diversion duodenal switch ( BPD-DS ) yet formally study . The investigator propose longitudinal study overall objective measure long-term impact three bariatric surgery ( RYGB , SG , BPD-DS ) metabolic , renal cardiovascular fate patient type 2 diabetes . The investigator overall hypothesis bariatric procedure generate hitherto unrecognized effect many disease-related outcome , greatly contribute beneficial impact diabetic patient . The investigator propose 3 specific aim : 1 ) establish long term effect three surgery metabolic recovery quality life group diabetic patient treated insulin , hypoglycemic agent diet ; 2 ) establish long term impact three surgery renal cardiovascular function subgroup patient condition ; 3 ) compare metabolic impact surgery best medical care diabetes non-surgical control group . For severely obese patient , lifestyle intervention , perhaps effective induce short-lived weight loss , ineffective long-term weight loss maintenance durable metabolic recovery . The increase popularity obesity surgery call well understand underlying mechanism . This especially true urgent consider knowledge relative impact procedure ( i.e . SG vs. RYGB BPD-DS ) resolve T2D still limit . Better knowledge procedure allow strong scientific rationale select right surgery right patient improve care severely obese individual .</brief_summary>
