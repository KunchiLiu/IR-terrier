	<detailed_description>After screen , eligibility criterion meet , child steroid dependent frequent relapse nephrotic syndrome ( SDNS FRNS ) enrol 53 week study . The study comprise 3 section ; screen , treatment , followup . Screening &lt; 4 week Day 1/week 1 . Treatment Day 1/Week 1 Day 15/Week 3 . Follow-Up Week 7 , Week 13 , Week 19 , Week 27 Week 53 . Participants randomize study pharmacy screen treatment Day1 . If participant randomize Rituximab , Treatment Day 15 base tolerance Rituximab infusion . Safety assessment occur every visit begin Day 1 .</detailed_description>
