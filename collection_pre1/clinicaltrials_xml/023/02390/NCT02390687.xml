	<brief_summary>Periodontitis infectious inflammatory disease . Bacteria modulate inflammatory response alter diversity periodontal disease . In recent year , various host-response modulation therapy develop block pathway responsible periodontal tissue breakdown . There significant change respect effectiveness , attitude towards conventional antimicrobial therapy combat disease . With threat widespread antibiotic resistance render many antibiotic useless important disease , increase necessity minimise antibiotic use develop novel non-antibiotic-based treatment , also raise profile disease prevention . One approach gain interest recent year use probiotic bacteria oral application . The rationale use oral health care stem increase evidence support claim benefit range disease . Lactobacilli play important role maintenance health stimulate natural immunity well contribute balance microflora , interact member flora . The application health promote bacteria therapeutic purpose , one strong emerge field . Time come shift paradigm treatment specific bacteria elimination alteration bacterial ecology use probiotic . So purpose study discover promise approach treatment chronic periodontitis .</brief_summary>
