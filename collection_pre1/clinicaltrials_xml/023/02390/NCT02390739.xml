	<brief_summary>Background The NCI Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy treat patient metastatic thyroid cancer involve take white blood cell patient , grow laboratory large number , genetically modify specific cell type virus ( retrovirus ) attack tumor cell , give cell back patient . This type therapy call gene transfer . In protocol , modify patient white blood cell retrovirus gene anti-thyroglobulin incorporated retrovirus . Objectives : The purpose study see tumor fight cell ( genetically modify cell ) express receptor thyroglobulin molecule surface cause thyroid tumor shrink see treatment safe . Eligibility : &lt; TAB &gt; Adults 18 old thyroid cancer thyroglobulin molecule tumor surface Design : &lt; TAB &gt; Work stage : Patients see outpatient NIH clinical Center undergo history physical examination , scan , x-ray , lab test , test need &lt; TAB &gt; Leukapheresis : If patient meet requirement study undergo leukapheresis obtain white blood cell make anti- thyroglobulin cell . { Leukapheresis common procedure , remove white blood cell patient . } &lt; TAB &gt; Treatment : Once cell grown , patient admit hospital conditioning chemotherapy , anti-thyroglobulin cell aldesleukin . They stay hospital 4 week treatment . Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every 1-3 month first year , every 6 month 1 year long tumor shrink . Follow visit take 2 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Administering Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes Transduced With Murine T-Cell Receptor Recognizing Human Thyroglobulin People With Thyroglobulin Expressing Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - We generate murine T-cell receptor ( mTCR ) recognize human thyroglobulin ( hTG ) context HLA-A0201 construct single retroviral vector contain alpha beta chain confer hTG recognition HLA-A0201+ PBL transduction . - In co-cultures HLA-A0201+ , hTG+ target cell , anti-TG mTCR transduce T cell secrete significant amount IFN- &gt; = high specificity . Objectives : Primary objective : - To determine safety administer PBL transduce anti-TG mTCR concert preparative lymphodepletion high dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ; aldesleukin ) . - Determine mTCR-transduced PBL mediate regression TG-expressing tumor . Eligibility : Patients HLA-A*0201 positive 18 year age old must -Advanced TG-expressing thyroid cancer ( include bone-only disease ) progress surgery ( indicate ) radioiodine ablation Patients may : -Contraindications high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : - PBMC obtain leukapheresis culture presence anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) aldesleukin order stimulate T-cell growth . - Transduction initiated exposure cell retroviral vector supernatant contain replication-incompetent virus encode anti-TG mTCR . - All patient receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen cyclophosphamide fludarabine . - On day 0 patient receive PBL transduce anti-TG mTCR begin high dose aldesleukin . - A complete evaluation evaluable lesion conduct approximately 4-6 week treatment . - The study conduct use Phase I/II optimal design . - The objective determine combination high dose aldesleukin , lymphocyte deplete chemotherapy , anti-TG mTCR-gene engineer lymphocytes able associated clinical response rate rule 5 % ( p0=0.05 ) favor modest 20 % PR + CR rate ( p1=0.20 ) . - A total 68 patient may require ; approximately 25 patient phase I portion study 43 ( 41 , plus allowance 2 non-evaluable ) patient phase II portion study .</detailed_description>
