	<detailed_description>Distal radius fracture common fracture upper extremity . While widely use method fracture fixation , numerous study show locked volar plate fixation associate soft tissue irritation , flexor extensor tendon rupture , screw penetration radiocarpal distal radioulnar joint ( DRUJ ) . Prominent hardware mandate hardware removal 5-18 % case . Intramedullary fixation recently receive attention literature minimally invasive procedure require device implantation . Additionally , intramedullary fixation place implant within bone instead onto , lack implant exposure , well decrease soft tissue dissection , carry potential decreased inflammation surgical site . This prospective randomized case series evaluate clinical functional outcome expandable intramedullary fixation device compare complication profile traditional fix angle volar lock plat single-surgeon case series single hospital . The wide variety distal radius fracture demand customize treatment , number different surgical treatment method available . ( 1 ) While percutaneous/external fixation , dorsal plating , fragment specific fixation , intramedullary rod fixation study , volar lock plate fixation emerge past decade common versatile method fracture fixation . Unfortunately , soft tissue hardware complication continue plague volar plate fixation , include digital stiffness , loss forearm rotation , tendinopathy tendon rupture , nerve injury compression , hardware irritation , screw prominence , CRPS , malunion . Tarallo et al perform retrospective review 303 patient undergone volar plate fixation find implant-related complication occur 5 % patient ( 2 ) . Of , common complication see tendon rupture , screw loosening , penetration articular space . While Tarallo et al study hardware related complication , study report complication associate volar lock plate fixation high 22-27 % ( 3,4 ) . The flexor pollicis longus particular vulnerable rupture , hardware prominence watershed line distal radius expose FPL flexor tendon frictional force result fraying rupture ( 5 ) . Prominent pegs screw dorsally threaten extensor pollicis longus neighbor extensor tendon . Intramedullary fixation limit data date , current method applicable relatively narrow subset radial fracture type . In case series three patient , Gunther Lynch show intramedullary fixation perform partially flexible rod lock rigid position implant bone result good functional outcome ( 6 ) . Patients return daily live one-year post-operatively adverse effect report . A prospective study analyze comparative functional outcome intramedullary nail versus volar plate fixation similarly find functional recovery comparative two group , complication rate slightly low intramedullary fixation cohort ( 7 ) . The author study however note continued potential screw penetration distal radioulnar joint ( DRUJ ) . The Conventus DRS expandable intramedullary fixation device use propose study FDA approve . A cadaveric study compare fixation strength Conventus DRS fix angle volar plate fixation demonstrate equivalency two axial compression mean stiffness dorsal bend mean stiffness ( 8 ) . The Conventus DRS use Europe 250 patient treated device . A safety efficacy 'white paper ' first 60 patient treat wide variety fracture demonstrate excellent improvement DASH score hardware related event overall adverse event profile 8.3 % . ( 9 ) There one re-operation loss fixation four minor case neuritis resolve . The device FDA-approved US , use across country .</detailed_description>
