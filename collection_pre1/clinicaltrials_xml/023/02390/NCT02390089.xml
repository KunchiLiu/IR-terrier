	<brief_summary>Aspiration pneumonia ( APn ) occur high rate patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) versus healthy adult . This particular public health concern give death secondary aspiration pneumonia lung infection lead cause death person PD . Swallowing cough function affect PD , put people PD significant risk uncompensated aspiration ( aspiration without adequate cough response ) . One challenge management airway protective deficit relate PD chronic progressive nature disease , swallow dysfunction appear subtly form microaspiration , reduce perceived urgency swallow disorder clinician patient . The long-term goal research advance management airway protection deficit patient neurodegenerative disease order decrease morbidity mortality due aspiration relate lung infection . The objective specify deficit lead uncompensated airway compromise PD order advance clinical management patient , lead immediate positive impact .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study complete one visit , take hour . All study procedures do investigator quiet clinical research area Center Movement Disorders Neurorestoration ( Room 7 ) . If participant agree research study , participant sign inform consent form , investigator ask participant question related participant health history . These question include : Do participant history breathe disorder disease ( asthma , emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , etc ) , severe chest injury ? - Do participant history stroke , neurologic disease besides Parkinson 's disease ? - Have participant smoke last 5 year ? - Have participant chest infection within last 5 week ? - Do participant history head neck cancer ? - Are participant allergic capsaicin , hot pepper , Zostrix cream , medicine ? The investigator ask question make sure participant history illness would affect ability cough would make unsafe participate . If participant answer yes question , able continue study . Next , investigator begin measure participant reflex cough . First , investigator attach small microphone clip participant shirt record participant cough response . The investigator participant inhale `` hot pepper '' vapor five different concentration . The hot pepper vapor separately deliver mouthpiece attach hand-held nebulizer ( device make vapor liquid ) . The investigator deliver type vapor participant 3 time total 15 presentation . After inhale vapor cough participant need , investigator ask participant rate urge cough use scale 0-10 , 0 equal urge cough , 10 equal great urge cough . If participant cough vapor , investigator present one final strong dose . There 2 minute break presentation vapor , water available time throughout study . This take approximately 40 minute . Next , investigator continue measure participant reflex cough use slightly different test . The investigator participant inhale water vapor ( fog ) low concentration hot pepper vapor . Both type vapor separate nebulizer , like one investigator use . For vapor , participant breathe nebulizer 's mouthpiece participant cough , 1 minute . The investigator try one 3 time , total 6 try .</detailed_description>
