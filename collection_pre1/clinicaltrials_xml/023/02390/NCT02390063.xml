	<brief_summary>This clinical trial new treatment prostate cancer type vaccine could new way treat cancer . A vaccine could alert immune system presence cancer cell body may enable immune system target kill cell effectively . This vaccine intend work make immune system kill cell special protein ( call 5T4 ) present surface cancer cell . The vaccine make two recombinant virus ( `` ChAdOx1 '' `` MVA '' ) design produce 5T4 protein modify weaken reproduce within body like normal virus . Once injected body , virus make 5T4 protein help body 's immune system learn target protein destroy cancer cell . This first-in-human study evaluate safety immunogenicity ChAdOx1.5T4-MVA.5T4 vaccination regime . It evaluate neo-adjuvant setting low intermediate risk localise prostate cancer patient either decide prostate remove stable active surveillance .</brief_summary>
