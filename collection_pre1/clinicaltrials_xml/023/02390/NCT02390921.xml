	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery effective long-term treatment morbid obesity treatment , maintain weight loss enduringly improvement resolution comorbidity mortality reduction . All bariatric surgery technique postoperative induce significant reduction food intake / absorption nutrient therefore may associate risk nutritional deficiency , increase year surgery . One nutrient whose absorption affect significantly iron , woman childbearing age segment vulnerable . A significant percentage woman require oral supplementation high dos iron often parenteral treatment need digestive intolerance therapeutic failure . Hypothesis : The liposome orally administer iron could represent therapeutic alternative woman childbearing age , previously undergone bariatric surgery currently require parenteral iron therapy . Objectives : To evaluate tolerability efficacy oral iron liposome female patient previously undergone bariatric surgery currently require parenteral replacement therapy , well impact quality life . Methods : single center , open , prospective , interventional , 40 woman childbearing age , previously undergone bariatric surgery , currently require intravenous iron therapy chronically . Subjects divide 2 parallel group : 20 case 20 control match age , level Hb , year surgery percentage weight lose . Relevance : This study allow u identify alternative treatment oral iron case patient severe iron deficiency bariatric surgery , currently require parenteral iron therapy due intolerance current oral product therapeutic failure . At time could help reduce healthcare cost improve quality life patient , enter periodically solitary day hospital administration parenteral iron .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Liposomated Iron Patients With Previous Bariatric Surgery Which Are Currently Receiving Parentheral Therapy With Iron</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project propose aim explore efficacy tolerability liposome orally administer iron female patient previously undergone bariatric surgery ( gastric bypass ) currently receive parenteral iron therapy chronically . The hypothesis : ( ) .- A significant percentage patient undergo bariatric surgery iron deficiency chronic complication . In investigator series , approximately 100 woman require intravenous iron therapy chronic ( 10 % patient undergo bariatric surgery date ) , significantly increase cost . ( ii ) .- The liposomal form iron depend gastric pH increase bioavailability dependent presence digestive dudodeno circuit . ( iii ) .- Increased iron absorption tolerability allow u remove chronic intravenous iron therapy case patient . Thus , majoraria quality life reduce healthcare cost avoid adverse reaction associate procedure . Main objective : To evaluate tolerability efficacy oral iron liposome female patient previously undergone bariatric surgery currently require parenteral replacement therapy chronic form . Secondary objective : ( ) .- To evaluate change level Hb , ferritin , iron , transferrin saturation 4 , 12 week treatment . ( ii ) .- Lay foundation future study pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics patient undergo bariatric surgery .</detailed_description>
