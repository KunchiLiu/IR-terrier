	<brief_title>Exparel Pain Control During Care Rib Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rib fracture common patient suffer traumatic injury , occur 10 % general injury case 30 % case injury directly chest . Usually caused injury chest wall , rib fracture often occur rib bend fragile . These kind injury commonly cause motor vehicle collision , fall , assault , industrial accident , gunshot , repetitive cause severe cough use-injury athlete . With types injury , first concern physician repair immediate damage chest wall ( penetrate wound , air blood chest cavity compress lung ( ) , fix break ribs place ) . Once injury repair stabilize , patient 's care consist control pain help recover normal breathing ability . In patient admitted hospital care , usually 1 2 rib broken , care often pain control use counter medicine like Tylenol Ibuprofen ( call NSAIDS ) prescription medicine like hydrocodone ( Vicodin® ) . The main concern follow-up patient full recovery pain-free breathing ability . In patient admitted hospital treatment , pneumonia common complication associate multiple broken rib . Pneumonia occur anywhere 15 % 30 % patient . For long-acting pain control help breathe easily , study show epidural analgesia ( pain relieve drug deliver thin tube call catheter fluid surround spinal cord ) preferable opioids , whether give pill form IV . Additional study show well result epidural pain control compare opioid NSAID use . However , method come risk side effect . Using oral NSAIDs result stomach irritation , kidney injury , interfere body 's ability form blood clot . Acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) show toxic liver high dos . Opioid use low person 's breathing ability even reduce pain , want patient already high risk pneumonia . Epidural placement complex procedure , risk infection site catheter insertion , cause itching , risks injury spinal cord membrane surround ( dura ) .</detailed_description>
