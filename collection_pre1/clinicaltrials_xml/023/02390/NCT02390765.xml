Studying child time may identify child high risk eating-related health concern . Objective : - To understand gene environment influence eat behavior health time . Eligibility : - Children age 8 17 good general health . Design : - Screening visit 1 : Medical history , physical exam , body measurement , question . - 14 day : Participants wear wrist monitor answer smartphone prompt eat mood . They may give stool sample . - Screening visit 2 : - Body measurement . - Saliva , urine , blood sample . - Heart test . - Meals provide ( fast overnight ) . - Questionnaires interview . - Behavior , think , exercise test . - X-ray left wrist full body. &lt; TAB &gt; - Some parent may medical history , physical exam , question screen visit . They may answer question yearly visit . - Participants 6 yearly visit . They give urine sample body measurement , repeat X-rays . They question behavior think task . They may give stool sample . Visits range 3 8 hour . - Participants may choose participate study : - Stress Hormones , 1 visit : While rest , participant give saliva sample heart monitor . Then math . They repeat rest part , computer task . - Brain Imaging , 2 visit : Twice , participant perform task magnetic cone head answer question .

	<detailed_description>This study aim disentangle vary disinhibited eat pattern , eat behavior endophenotypes , lead excessive weight gain obesity-related comorbidities youth . Extensive baseline evaluation , include three separate experimental paradigm , annual follow-up assessment assist identify biopsychosocial mechanism appear increase risk , maintain , eat behavior lead weight gain . Illumination early risk factor specific eat behavior endophenotypes associate health outcome inform development target intervention pediatric obesity . Participants current study include 500 healthy obese non-obese boy girl ( 8 17yo baseline ) parents/caregivers . Youth first complete two visit order ensure study eligibility evaluate self-regulatory , motivational , neurocognitive factor appear salient development maintenance disinhibited eat behavior , include : psychological distress , sleep behavior , food reinforcement , reward sensitivity , executive functioning , attention bias , range relate genetic physiological factor . Eating behavior observed laboratory use several validated paradigm . For two week , participant monitor sleep use wrist actigraphy , well record mood , eat behavior , eat cognition use smart phone ( via ecological momentary assessment method ) . Youth invite complete three separate experimental paradigm design elucidate cognitive , emotional , physiological process associate disinhibited eat behavior . All participant complete annual evaluation weight adiposity total six year , extensive evaluation self-regulatory , motivational neurocognitive functioning every three year . Studying child adolescent longitudinally allow examination independent share risk factor pediatric disinhibited eat excess weight . Data evaluation use test specific hypothesis , also hypothesis-generating inform development additional empirical question subsequent experiment . Thus , current protocol offer flexibility examine potentially critical contribution weight gain child continue biopsychosocial development .</detailed_description>
