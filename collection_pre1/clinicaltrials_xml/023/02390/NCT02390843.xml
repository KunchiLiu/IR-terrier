	<brief_title>Simvastatin With Topotecan Cyclophosphamide Relapsed and/or Refractory Pediatric Solid CNS Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy resistance major cause treatment failure pediatric solid tumor . STAT3 ( Signal Transducer Activator Transcription 3 ) transcription factor promote tumor proliferation , metastasis chemotherapy resistance . Pediatric solid tumor neuroblastoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , osteosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma , central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor glioblastoma medulloblastoma aberrant STAT3 signaling . In neuroblastoma , bone marrow production interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , STAT3 activate cytokine , associate poor prognosis . Thus STAT3 cognate ligand , IL-6 , rational therapeutic target pediatric solid CNS tumor . HMG-CoA ( 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ) reductase inhibitor , `` statin '' , low LDL ( low density lipoprotein ) cholesterol inhibit rate-limiting step cholesterol biosynthesis . Pleiotropic property statins find contribute lower risk heart disease , decrease incidence cancer well , lead use clinical trial adult solid CNS tumor . Statins show inhibit IL-6 mediate STAT3 activation prevent recruitment pro-inflammatory cell injured heart tissue adult patient . Therefore , investigator hypothesize HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor , simvastatin , augment chemotherapy effect improve survival patient refractory relapse pediatric solid CNS tumor . This Phase I trial simvastatin combination topotecan cyclophosphamide refractory and/or relapse solid CNS tumor childhood , investigator define toxicity evaluate cholesterol level IL6/STAT3 pathway change biomarkers patient response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must histologic verification malignancy original diagnosis relapse . All subject relapse refractory solid tumor eligible include primary metastatic CNS tumor . In case diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) , optic pathway glioma , image finding consistent tumor suffice without need biopsy histologic verification . Subjects must either measurable ( presence least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension long diameter least 20 mm . With spiral CT scan , lesion must least 10 mm . ) evaluable disease ( presence least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension . Such lesion may evaluable nuclear medicine technique , immunocytochemistry technique , tumor marker reliable measure . ) Subject 's current disease state must one know curative therapy .
