Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) single important treatment people live HIV optimize viral suppression slow disease progression . Adherence ART considerable public health implication , particularly give optimal adherence decrease morbidity mortality , decrease potential development drug resistant strain HIV , reduce HIV infectiousness . Project PLUS ( Positive Living Understanding Support ) first ( knowledge ) theory-based behavioral intervention , integrate motivational interview cognitive-behavioral skill training , demonstrate significant improvement viral load , CD4 cell count , self-reported adherence among racially ethnically diverse sample HIV-positive woman men enrol randomize controlled trial , first intervention hazardous drinker demonstrate significant effect . A clinic-based replication crucial next step study intervention 's effectiveness real world deliver HIV clinic provider patient . In collaboration medical provider Spencer Cox Center Health Institute Advanced Medicine , Mount Sinai Health System , large provider HIV medical care New York City area , goal well understand alcohol-related outcome among HIV-positive person lifespan conduct multisite comparative effectiveness trial three intensity treatment—the PLUS intervention , enhance treatment usual ( eTAU ) condition , treatment usual ( TAU ) condition—to test clinical cost-effectiveness PLUS intervention reduce alcohol use improve ART adherence , viral load , CD4 count among HIV-positive hazardous drinker . This study potential exert sustain powerful impact effectiveness ART intervention HIV-positive person problematic drinking .</detailed_description>
