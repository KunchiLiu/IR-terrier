	<brief_title>Neurological Prognostication Patients Therapeutic Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurological prognostication patient therapeutic hypothermia cardiac arrest Background : In Denmark , approximately 3000 people suffer cardiac arrest ( CA ) year . After CA blood flow five minute , cerebral ischemia , free radical along mediator create chemical cascade reperfusion result cerebral injury often severe neurologic impairment . Therapeutic hypothermia ( TH ) become standard treatment comatose CA patient lead new challenge area prognostication , low temperature sedative relaxing drug use keep patient coma , affect examination perform clinician . This call reevaluation exist prognostic examination invention implementation new one . A new awareness towards prognostic model involve several different modality include SSEP , EEG , biomarkers clinical examination thus awaken . The aim study evaluate use EEG , SSEP , four biomarkers five clinical examination observation . We evaluate patient use Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories ( CPC ) . EEG The EEG analysis today qualitative analysis base assessment trained specialist . New method EEG analysis base digital quantitative analysis therefore less sensitive interpersonal difference uncertainty subjective assessment . EEG reactivity observe change EEG link stimulation ( fx noxious auditory ) promising predictor outcome concern CA patient anoxic coma ( 1 , 9 ) . In study use power-spectral analysis assessment EEG reactivity investigate prognostic value power analyse four frequency band delta , theta , alpha beta . Certain EEG-patterns , malignant pattern , predictor bad neurological outcome : 1. burst-suppression pattern discharge epileptiform activity . ( 1 ) . 2 . Generalized suppression ( 17 ) . 3 . Isoelectric EEG pattern ( 17 ) . 4 . Electroencephalographic status epilepticus ( ESE ) flat background . Hypotheses : 1 . It possible measure reactivity quantitatively EEG use power spectrum analysis correlate outcome 6 month use CPC scale dichotomize good ( CPC 1-2 ) poor ( CPC 3-5 ) outcome . 2 . EEG predictive value good bad outcome 48h group compare 24h group use dichotomize CPC-scale 6 month . SSEP : Somatosensory Evoked Potentials examination median nerve stimulate cortical response ( N20 ) assess . Bilateral absence N20 component SSEP , one exception , invariably associate bad outcome , CPC 4-5 ( 1 , 2 , 7 ) . SSEP maintain high predictive value bad outcome hypothermia ( 7 , 15 ) one case describe patient regain N20 response initial bilaterally absent response measure 24 hour hypothermia ( 106 ) . SSEP hardy examination EEG concern medication metabolic imbalance therefore prognostically reliable response absent ( 1 ) . Hypothesis : The predictive value bilaterally absence SEP response death permanent vegetative state ( CPC4-5 ) 100 % 24 , 48 72 hour group ( 24h 48h hypothermia ) . Neurological examination : The brainstem resistant hypoxia cerebral cortex absence brainstem reflex good predictor bad outcome comatose patient . Several study show presence myoclonias seizures absence corneal- , light- oculocephalic reflex along absence motor response noxious stimulation strongly associate severe neurological deficit , permanent vegetative state death CA ( 1 , 12 , 15 ) . Our aim validate use neurological examination prolong hypothermia 48 hour investigate difference incidence two group . Hypothesis : There high incidence absent brainstem reflexes 24h group compare 48h group evaluate 72 hour . Biochemical marker : Specific biochemical marker demonstrate well predictive value many clinical examination prediction poor outcome patient remain unconscious cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) . Especially neuron-specific enolase ( NSE ) S-100B use prognostication comatose CA patient ( 3 , 4 , 8 , 74 , 14 ) . Cut-off value predictive value bad outcome 100 % suggest , small number patient study failure agree biochemical marker best , new study include NSE S-100B along test new biochemical marker need . In study wish compare two new biochemical marker Copeptin NT-proBNP NSE S-100B . Copeptin release response stress sensitive stable surrogate marker arginine vasopressin release . Measurement copeptin level show promising prognostic marker patient CA therapeutic hypothermia ( 16 ) . B-type Natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) cardiac neurohormone synthesize ventricular myocardium secrete response ventricular expansion pressure overload ( 11 ) . The BNP level arrival emergency room show significantly high among patient die post-resuscitation syndrome , reperfusion ischemic tissue occur cytokine endotoxines spread throughout organism result drop cardiac output cerebral blood flow . The ability BNP predict degree post-resuscitation syndrome therefore make promise neurologic biochemical marker ( 5 ) . NSE release neuronal damage impairment blood-brain barrier integrity detect release NSE cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) eventually blood . Increases CSF serum NSE level report stroke , brain injury , CA ( 80 ) . When used GCS SEP , NSE demonstrate augment predictive value neurological outcome ( 8 ) . Protein S100 beta ( S100B ) express mainly human astroglial cell surrogate marker neuronal damage ( 13 ) . S-100B rise peak-concentration quickly CA thus , constant elevation S100B level serum reflect continuous release damage tissue predicts bad outcome ( 13 ) . S-100B serf prognostic predictor within 24 hour CA , thus early stage factor like NSE ( 4 ) . Our aim investigate new prognostic marker Copeptin NT-proBNP compare NSE S-100B patient treat therapeutic hypothermia CA . Hypotheses : 1 . 48 hour therapeutic hypothermia reduces total release NSE S-100B compare 24 hour measure area curve 24 72 hour . 2 . The total release NT-proBNP Copeptin measure area curve ( AUC ) significantly correlate neurological outcome ( dichotomize CPC score ) 6 month . 3 . To find cut-off-value copeptin NT-proBNP sample take arrival hospital predict good ( CPC1-2 ) bad ( CPC 3-5 ) outcome false positive rate 0 % . Materials method : EEG SEP perform patient 1 : 12-24h reach target temperature ( T0 , 33 degree celsius ) , 2 : 36-48h 3 : 72-96h T0 comatose patient . During EEG record three sequence 30 second noxious stimulation mark use later quantitative power-spectral analysis ass reactivity . All EEG 's assessed neurophysiologist soon record possible order see ESE present , treat physician notify . The final interpretation EEG conduct blind later stage . When analyse EEG catalog benign malignant pattern partly use Rossettis ( 9 ) simple operational method assess follow parameter : Reactivity noxious stimulation , continuous background activity ESE . After 6 month patient categorize Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance category ( CPC ) , 1 = good recovery , 2 = moderate disability , 3 = severe disability dependency daily-life activity , 4 = vegetative state , 5 = death . SEP : Cortical N20 response median nerve SEPs record standard procedure hypothermia . SEP perform maximum 3 time patient describe . Recordings assess neurophysiologist document `` absent '' ( bilaterally absent cortical N20 response leave right median nerve stimulation , presence cervical potential ) , `` present '' ( cortical N20 response present least 1 side ) , `` undeterminable '' ( technically insufficient record ) . Undeterminable SEP result consider present The chosen examination analysis , apart power-spectral analysis , well know standard examination perform routinely hospitals world . EEG SEP perform medical student Kristoffer NÃ¸hr physician Christophe Duez . The interpretation do neurophysiologist Christophe Duez participate increasingly . Biochemical marker : NT-proBNP , NSE , S-100B Copeptin take hospital admission , 24h , 48h 72h . NT-proBNP furthermore take 96h . Blinding : EEG blind treat physician unless ESE present . All primary SEP blind treat physician . If SEP perform 72h unblinded . All biochemical marker blind . Statistical analysis : The QEEG study study new method context CA data therefore available statistical analysis . If difference outcome 24h 48h group pool data analyse group separately . The aim study clinical neurological examination , classical EEG biochemical sample generate new hypothesis power assessment strong enough assess examination one one . We still believe however examination highly relevant investigate additive effect multimodal examination many study investigate important body examination within study . Furthermore data kind patient treat prolonged hypothermia 48 hour since never do randomize trial . It possible enrol 100 patient 2 year study base patient flow Aarhus University Hospital believe 50 patient either group sufficient basic validation well establish examination well new one form basis generate new hypothesis . Prognostic study kind perform previously Denmark see unique opportunity patient group create basis new study area neuro-prognostics Emergency Medicine Intensive Care . This protocol write biostatistical assistance . Perspective : The aim study contribute understand long period therapeutic hypothermia affect examination use neurological prognostic CA . In future expect EEG , SEP clinical examination biochemical marker become integrated part faster precise neurologic prognostication guide physician decision concern discontinuation intensive therapy . This benefit many level financial implication care patient vegetative state prolong impaired consciousness substantial , family member yearn know functional outcome expect love one maybe important ; patient spar suffer unfruitful continuation therapy .</detailed_description>
