	<brief_summary>This research study way gain new knowledge combination Taselisib drug treatment metastatic breast cancer . Taselisib investigational drug work block protein call PI3K ( phosphoinositide 3-kinase ) help cancer cell grow . This drug use laboratory experiment information study suggest drug may help prevent slow growth cancer cell . The main purpose study find appropriate dose Taselisib use drug clinical study . This open-label , 3+3 dose-escalation phase Ib study identify Maximum Tolerated Dose ( ) ( MTD ) identify recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) Taselisib . This study conduct 4 separate arm . ( A-D ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ib Dose-escalation Trial Taselisib ( GDC-0032 ) Combination With Anti-HER2 Therapies Participants With Advanced HER2+ Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study divide two part , combination dose find escalation part ( Part 1 ) dose combination expansion part ( Part 2 ) . Participants enter one Part ( either 1 2 ) receive study drug one combindation study drug , know arm , assign main study physician . The study include four different arm list : - Arm A : Taselisib Trastuzumab emtansine ( also call T-DM1 ) - Arm B : Taselisib Trastuzumab emtansine Pertuzumab - Arm C : Taselisib Pertuzumab Trastuzumab - Arm D : Taselisib Pertuzumab , Trastuzumab , Paclitaxel Part 1 : Since look high dose Taselisib administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant breast cancer , everyone participates Part 1 research study receive dose Taselisib . The dose participant get depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . Each combination dose give group 3 - 6 participant . The result group review depend result , different combination dose schedule may investigate next group participant combination dose take participant may repeat next group participant investigate result ( different schedule mean instead take dos every day , participant may take day week ) . Part 2 : The dos part base best combination dose Part 1 . This part look potential side effect see cancer responds drug .</detailed_description>
