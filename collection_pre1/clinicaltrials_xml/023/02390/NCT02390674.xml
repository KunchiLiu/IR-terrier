	<brief_summary>Routine primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) heart attack involve open block artery balloon insert metal scaffold ( stent ) hold artery open . During procedure inflammation occur cause damage heart . The objective trial determine whether administration drug ciclosporin prior PPCI reduces amount damage heart relative treatment placebo . The damage heart assess 12 week magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Patients followed-up 12 month participation study . This single centre study look recruit 68 patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease condition supply blood oxygen heart reduce due narrow artery supply heart . A heart attack cause one artery become block . Modern treatment heart attack call primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) . PPCI involve open block artery balloon place stent ( small metal tube ) artery hold open . Research show opening block artery , inflammation develops within heart . This inflammation generate immune system . Initial study suggest certain immune system cell ( T-cells ) may involve cause much damage occur heart follow heart attack . The drug ciclosporin temporarily inhibits immune system show small number patient reduce size heart attack . The aim clinical trial investigate large number patient whether size heart attack reduce patient treat drug ciclosporin prior PPCI relative patient treat placebo ( saline ) . To participate trial must large heart attack ( STEMI - ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ) undergo PPCI unblock artery . You must also age 18 year . You randomise receive either single dose drug ciclosporin placebo block artery open . Half people get drug ciclosporin . This randomisation enable u compare result see whether treatment ciclosporin reduces size heart attack compare placebo . There may immediate benefit take part trial information get trial help improve treatment people heart attack future . As far know disadvantage take part trial . If randomise 'drug ' group , small risk side effect ciclosporin , high blood pressure slight worsen kidney function . We expect side effect ciclosporin give trial . On rare occasion allergic reaction observe . If ciclosporin-related side effect occur , would expect soon drug administer . This single centre , randomise , double-blind , parallel group , placebo-controlled phase II/III trial compare efficacy ciclosporin versus placebo 68 patient acute myocardial infarction undergo PPCI . The trial set tertiary care centre ( Freeman Hospital , Newcastle upon Tyne , UK ) patient recruit period 18 month . The trial design show superiority regard primary endpoint . During initial hospitalisation follow myocardial infarction , treatment give prior perform PPCI catheter laboratory . The duration study patient 12 month final follow-up ( 12 week randomise control trial ( RCT ) follow 9 month study follow-up ) . Should treatment ciclosporin look promising , large trial design evaluate ciclosporin treatment fully . In contrast previous study , trial restrict anterior STEMI patient . It also analyse change inflammatory response follow reperfusion use MRI ( current gold standard ) every patient quantify infarct size , ejection fraction microvascular obstruction .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients present acute myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) Age 18 year Presenting within 6 hour onset chest pain ST segment elevation . The culprit coronary artery major coronary artery diameter least 3mm proximally occlude ( TIMI flow grade 01 ) time admission coronary angiography Patients disorder associate immunological dysfunction ( acute chronic inflammatory neoplastic coexisting disease , know positive serology HIV , hepatitis ) Clinically unstable patient ( haemodynamically unstable , cardiogenic shock , unconscious patient ) Patients evidence coronary collateral infarct area Patients open ( TIMI &gt; 1 ) culprit coronary artery time angiography . Previous myocardial infarction Previous thrombolytic therapy Patients know hypersensitivity ciclosporin egg , peanut soyabean protein . Patients know renal insufficiency ( either know glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2 ) current medical care severe renal insufficiency . Known liver insufficiency Uncontrolled hypertension ( &gt; 180/110 mmHg ) Patients treat compound contain hypericum perforatum , stiripentol , Aliskiren , Bosentan Rosuvastatin active treatment might modify blood concentration ciclosporin . Female patient currently pregnant woman childbearing age use contraception ( verbal diagnosis ) . Female patient childbearing potential use contraception subsequently find positive urine pregnancy test ( pregnancy test perform soon reasonably practicable investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) administration ) . Contraindication cardiac MRI : Pacemaker Implantable defibrillator Patients unable undergo cardiac MRI follow reason : Frailty judge clinician . Frailty define meeting three five follow criterion : low grip strength , low energy , slow walk speed , low physical activity and/or unintentional weight loss . Due tight time constraint emergency set trial clinician test parameter need exercise judgment . Claustrophobic patient take elevator afraid narrow enclose space . Breathlessness patient suffer breathlessness rest low exercise level ( e.g . walk level ) . Use investigational study drug within 30 day prior trial entry ( defined date randomisation trial ) . Coenrolment study allow . Lack capacity give initial verbal consent Life expectancy &lt; 1year due noncardiac illness</criteria>
