	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect bexagliflozin lower hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) level patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . Bexagliflozin orally administer drug treatment T2DM classify Sodium Glucose co-Transporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) Inhibitor . This study enroll treatment naive subject previously treat one oral hypoglycemic agent ( OHA ) . Approximately 320 subject eligible randomization receive bexagliflozin tablet , 5 , 10 , 20 mg placebo , daily 12 week outpatient setting .</brief_summary>
