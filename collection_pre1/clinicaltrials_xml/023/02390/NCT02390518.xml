	<criteria>Clinically confirm brain metastasis CT MRI criterion . It preferable extracranial metastatic disease lesion pathologically confirm review University Utah Huntsman Cancer Hospital pathology obtain outside hospital . Prior brain surgery allow , although SRS ( Stereotactic Radiosurgery ) treatment operative bed would `` tumor '' enrol dose escalation portion trial . SRS would deliver 46 week postsurgery patient craniotomy resection lesion . It PI 's discretion enroll patient SRS deliver outside 46 postcraniotomy window . 15 brain metastasis total Maximum tumor diameter &lt; 40mm CT MRI measurement , time consultation/screening , metastatic lesion present brain All metastatic lesion must minimum distance 3 cmm measure peripheral edge lesion closest proximity one another . If multiple lesion least 3 centimeter away , patient deem ineligible . Systemic therapy allow , although appropriate washout require patient BRAF ( inhibitor least 7 day . For subject currently active systemic cancer therapy , treat medical oncologist consult ensure proper washout period prior SRS . Age &gt; 18 year old KPS ( Karnofsky Performance Status ) &gt; 60 Able provide inform consent sign approve consent form conform federal institutional guideline . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 10 day study enrollment must agree use acceptable method birth control receive radiation 3 month radiation . Women nonchildbearing potential may include either surgically sterile postmenopausal &gt; 1 year . Men able father child must agree use acceptable method birth control receive radiation , 3 month radiation . Prior whole/partial brain irradiation stereotactic radiosurgery Brain lesion maximal diameter &gt; 40 mm size MRI imaging time consultation/screening protocol eligibility . Lesion locate anatomic region amendable SRS , include brain stem , optic apparatus , eloquent cortex Radiographic cytologic evidence leptomeningeal disease Primary lesion radiosensitive histology include follow : small cell carcinoma , germ cell tumor , lymphoma , leukemia , multiple myeloma Women childbearing potential pregnant breast feeding Patients multiple lesion , size criterion would enrol cohort full time enrollment 12 week DLT period reach .</criteria>
