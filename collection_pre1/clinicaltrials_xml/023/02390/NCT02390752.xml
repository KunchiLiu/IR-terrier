	<detailed_description>Background - Traditional therapeutic approach pediatric cancer focus cytotoxic agent , recently , target inhibition cellular signaling pathway use small molecule kinase inhibitor . Despite intervention , significant number pediatric cancer patient develop recurrent resistant disease . Targeting tumor microenvironment promise incompletely explore strategy treatment pediatric cancer non-cancer tumor . - This trial begin explore disruption interaction neoplastic cell myeloid component tumor microenvironment treatment strategy pediatric cancer neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) relate plexiform neurofibroma ( PN ) malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ( MPNST ) . - PLX3397 orally available small molecule inhibitor class III protein tyrosine kinases include Kit , CSF1R ( colony stimulate factor 1 receptor ) /Fms ( Feline McDonough Sarcoma ) , oncogenic Flt3 ( Fms like tyrosine kinase ) . Primary Objectives - Phase I : Evaluate safety tolerability PLX3397 , determine recommend phase II dose PLX3397 pediatric patient refractory solid tumor include NF1 MPNST brain tumor refractory leukemia , limited acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . - Phase II : Determine anti-tumor activity PLX3397 patient NF1 PN . Objective response rate ( ORR ) define proportion patient partial response ( PN volume decrease great equal 20 % determine volumetric MRI analysis ) . PN Cohort temporarily suspend requested FDA due IND Safety Report 07 October 2016 . Eligibility - Tumor type : - Phase I : Children ( great equal 3 lessthan equal 21 year age ) recurrent refractory solid tumor include primary neoplasms central nervous system patient NF1 MPNST . NF1 PN Cohort temporarily suspend requested FDA due IND Safety Report 07 October 2016. , Children ( great equal 3 less equal 21 year age ) refractory leukemia ( AML ALL ) ( Phase 1 ) . - Phase II : Patients NF1 inoperable PN , cause morbidity ( great equal 3 lessthan equal 35 year age ) . PN Cohort temporarily suspend requested FDA due IND Safety Report 07 October 2016 . - Subjects must adequate performance status , able swallow tablet , may pregnant breastfeeding , adequate major organ function . Subjects history severe uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic cardiovascular pulmonary disease , history prolong QT syndrome exclude . Design - Phase I - Using rolling-six phase I design 2-6 subject per dose level standard definition MTD ( cycle 1 ) DLT . - PLX3397 administer orally ( 200 mg capsule ) daily continuous basis cycle 28 day without rest period cycle . Patients must able swallow intact capsule . Dosing base body surface area ( BSA ) , total weekly dose round within 10 % calculate dose use dose nomogram . - At MTD , recommend phase II dose level expand 12 patient attempt make enroll least 3 patient refractory solid tumor 3 patient refractory acute leukemia ( ALL AML ) gain experience toxicity pharmacokinetics PLX3397 disease cohort . Attempts make enroll equal number patient age 3 12 year 12 year age gain pharmacokinetic safety data broad age range . - Phase II ( PN Cohort temporarily suspend requested FDA due IND Safety Report 07 October 2016 . ) - A Simon 2-stage design use : 9 evaluable patient NF1 inoperable PN cause morbidity enrol initial stage , great equal 1/9 patient response ( PN volume decrease great equal 20 % compare baseline ) , enrollment expand total 17 evaluable patient . - Impact therapy patient-reported outcome evaluate patient PN . This study assess general health-related qualify life ( QOL ) pain ( pain intensity pain interference ) patient-reported outcome ( PROs ) . - To complete Phase I Phase II portion , maximum ( 24 + 17= 41 plus 6 replace inevaluable patient ) 47 patient accrue 2 2.5 year .</detailed_description>
