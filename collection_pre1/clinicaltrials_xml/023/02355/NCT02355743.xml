	<brief_title>rtPA Prevention CVAD-Associated Thrombosis Infection Pediatric Patients With Short Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central venous access device ( CVAD ) use routinely chronically ill pediatric patient administration medication , parenteral nutrition laboratory test . Several complication result use long-term CVADs , namely venous sepsis thrombosis , significantly increase associated morbidity mortality . CVAD-associated thrombosis occur 50 % child long-term CVAD use especially common patient require life-sustaining long-term total parenteral nutrition ( 1 ) . Catheter thrombosis may arise fibrin sheath formation around catheter tip , intraluminal blood clot within catheter , venous thrombosis obstruct vein occlude catheter tip . Within 24 hour typically within 2 week placement CVAD , fibrin sheath form around tip ( 2-5 ) . Development intraluminal thrombosis venous thrombosis less predictable . There grow body evidence link development CVAD-associated thrombosis line-related infection . It known protein within thrombus include fibronectin fibrinogen attract bacteria , specifically staphylococcal specie . The bacteria bind ligands associate thrombus thus allow bacterial proliferation ( 6-8 ) . The clinical relevance line thrombus development line infection underscore study pediatric patient Hickman catheter , 18 % catheter thrombosis develop line-associated bloodstream infection , none develop catheter infection also catheter clot ( 7 ) . Thus , hypothesize prevention catheter-related clot formation use local thrombolytic agent also prevent infection catheter . The primary research question pose , patient short bowel syndrome require central venous access device ( CVAD ) long-term total parenteral nutrition , weekly recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rtPA ) lock therapy effective routine care use heparin flush reduce incidence line-associated thrombosis infection .</detailed_description>
