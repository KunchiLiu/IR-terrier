	<brief_title>INCB039110 Combination With Erlotinib Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) Activating Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist open-label , safety run-in confirm safety INCB039110 combination erlotinib subject nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) Stage IIIB , Stage IV , recurrent whose tumor EGFR activate mutation . Subjects safety run-in receive open-label INCB039110 erlotinib . In second part study , subject enrol randomized receive erlotinib ( open-label ) either INCB039110 placebo blind manner . The dose INCB039110 administer determine data produce safety run-in phase . Treatment consist repeat 21-day cycle . Subjects take erlotinib tablet daily INCB039110/placebo self-administered daily entire cycle .</detailed_description>
