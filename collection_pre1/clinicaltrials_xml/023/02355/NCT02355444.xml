	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) common cause death Ireland , account 33 % death . Hypertension elevate blood pressure , also significant health problem , however , one major controllable risk factor associate CVD . While increased consumption fruit vegetable associate reduced risk CVD , evidence accumulate consumption berry fruit particular , may promote cardiovascular health . Blackberries favourable nutritional profile , rich dietary fibre , vitamins C , K folate low dietary fat kilocalorie . In addition , blackberry rich source antioxidant , contain numerous phytochemical include polyphenols . The aim study investigate potential beneficial effect blackberry consumption cardiovascular health , particular , effect blood pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Blackberry-derived Polyphenols Cardiovascular Risk Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dietary factor play significant role prevention and/or treatment hypertension significant effort put development functional food antihypertensive activity . Blackberries intrinsic polyphenols , consume part healthy diet , may functional interest treatment prevention hypertension dyslipidaemia . The Cardio-Rubus study present healthy adult opportunity participate human nutrition study assist identify biological effect blackberry-derived component establish value berry nutritious , health conducive food . It propose carry crossover , randomize double-blind 18-week supplementation study 100 men woman age 45-70 year systolic blood pressure 130-149 mmHg otherwise good health . The propose sample size base systolic blood pressure data derive baseline value 700 adult participate RCTs conduct UCC last 6-7 year . The calculation sample size base observational data systolic blood pressure old pre-hypertensive adult , show mean ( SD ) SBP 135 ( 3 ) mmHg . The propose study power detect mean drop 2 mmHg systolic blood pressure 85 % power significance level 5 % . The calculation support recruitment 100 participant total ( n = 41 per group , round 50 account 20 % attrition rate ) . Potential study participant recruit researcher School Food &amp; Nutritional Sciences study visit take place Human Nutrition Studies Unit , UCC . In addition provision write information , study protocol clearly comprehensively discuss potential participant prior enrollment provision inform write consent . Participants initially complete 2-week run period involve refrain consumption specify food item ( predominantly berry fruit ) end study . Each participant randomly assign receive one two beverage ( either high dose low dose blackberry polyphenol enrich beverage ) period 6-weeks ( study phase 1 ) 2-week wash-out , participant receive opposite treatment provide study phase 1 next 6-weeks ( study phase 2 ) . After completion study phase 2 2-week wash-out follow final visit UCC . Thus , screen enrolment study , 5 visit UCC ( baseline endpoint study phase end final washout phase ) . All 5 visit fast morning visit nurse take small blood sample analyse blood lipid , fast glucose biomarkers endothelial function . Brachial central blood pressure measure well assessment arterial stiffness pulse wave velocity analysis . Body weight , BMI waist circumference also measure . Each participant 's body composition ( % body fat &amp; lean mass ) assess DXA scan . All information collect strictly confidential . Samples questionnaires label unique identify code , participant 's name use stage data collection , database construction data analysis . Data archive principal investigator . In publication document , participant identify name code number . Group summary data present place individual data , ensure confidentiality .</detailed_description>
