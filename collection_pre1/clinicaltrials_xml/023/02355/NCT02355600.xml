	<brief_summary>Survival young patient cancer increase also increased adverse long-term side effect chemotherapy , large number woman experience loss ovarian function without accomplish reproductive desire due gonadotoxic treatment . The ovarian reserve determine response control ovarian hyperstimulation fertility preservation treatment well assist reproduction technique . Improving reserve avoid depletion process could result increase fertility rate cancer treatment . Collecting follicle tamoxifen treatment would increase number cryopreserved oocytes thus rise potential ovarian reserve patient , reduce due age , chemotherapy length treatment . The aim study retrieve viable mature oocytes adjuvancy tamoxifen breast cancer patient improve probability subsequent pregnancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oocyte Recovery During Tamoxifen Adjuvant Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New chemotherapy regimens management option develop last 20 year yield increased survival rate cancer patient also cause side effect premature ovarian failure infertility due gonadotoxicity . Hormone therapy also increase survival rate breast cancer patient ; tamoxifen , selective estrogen receptor modulator , proven reduce risk recurrence mortality due breast cancer administer 10 year . The risk premature ovarian failure depend gonadotoxicity chemotherapy also age patient , therefore although tamoxifen gonadotoxic , compromise fertility long length treatment subsequent delay childbearing . On hand , tamoxifen drug use assist reproduction technique induce ovarian stimulation , therefore , tamoxifen treatment follow breast cancer patient represent somehow way continuous ovarian stimulation . If viable oocyte could retrieve long-term hormonal treatment tamoxifen , option use restore fertility afterwards . STUDY DESIGN : Patients include study normal menstrual period monitor sonography ( antral follicle count ) serum hormonal level : E2 ( oestradiol ) , P4 ( progesterone ) , FSH ( follicle stimulate hormone ) LH ( luteinizing hormone ) second day cycle . Patients without spontaneous menstruation perform periodic visit every 15 day image correspond antral follicle definition see , consider day 2 cycle . Follow-up antral follicle do sonography serum hormonal level accord protocol investigator vitro fertilization unit . When follicle 18 mm see , 250 Âµg hCG ( human chorionic gonadotropin ) administer 36 hour , transvaginal oocyte retrieval perform . Oocyte embryo quality assessment perform accord morphological ASEBIR ( association study reproduction biology ) classification day +2 +3 . Grade 1 2 embryos day +3 cryopreserved . Patients require assist reproduction technology get pregnant completion oncologic treatment embryo thaw subsequently transfer . FOLLOW-UP : During time oocyte retrieve used end gestation case patient become pregnant . Bearing mind patient center undergo 5 year tamoxifen treatment , assume maximum follow-up 6 year .</detailed_description>
