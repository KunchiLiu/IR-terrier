	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) common intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient remain associated dismal prognosis . The diagnosis AKI rely functional criterion ( oliguria serum creatinine elevation ) , carry several important limitation . Additionally , investigator lack biomarker may predict short term renal prognosis . Doppler-based renal resistive index ( RI ) measurement rapid noninvasive investigative tool may hold promise early AKI detection ICU patient differentiate transient persistent AKI select critically ill patient . Although several study suggest adequate performance predict short-term reversibility AKI , study perform limited patient sample . Additionally , recent study identify discrepant result regard diagnostic performance . The main objective large prospective multicentre study assess diagnostic performance Doppler-based renal resistive index diagnose persistent AKI critically ill patient require mechanical ventilation .</brief_summary>
