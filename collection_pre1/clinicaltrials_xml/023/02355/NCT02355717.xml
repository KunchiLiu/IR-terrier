	<brief_summary>The propose research bring together complementary expertise systematically elucidate longitudinal effect ( 1 ) total regional body fat ( 2 ) metabolic impairment accompanies obesity bone development growth . The contribution research significant provide solid foundation understand influence fat ( total regional distribution ) overall bone strength , whether insulin resistance , beta-cell dysfunction , abnormal lipid , inflammation could underpinning factor fat-bone strength relationship via effect bone model activity . This knowledge provide critical information need maximize potential therapeutic intervention counter link risk obesity osteoporosis , major public health concern .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall goal study clarify relationship adiposity bone development adolescence , explicate mechanism regulate effect excess adiposity bone . In effort , conduct 2-year longitudinal study 400 child adolescent age 9-15 year . Using peak adolescent growth period model probe determinant bone health may allow clear picture process regulate bone development , process highly active growth stage . Unlike study surrogates adiposity , plan measure total central adiposity directly , use dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) magnetic resonance imaging . Both bone quantity bone quality , two principal determinant bone strength , assess peripheral quantitative compute tomography ( pQCT ) weight-bearing ( tibia ) non-weight-bearing ( radius ) skeletal site . Peripheral QCT provide 3-dimensional bone measurement confound change bone size , significant confounder past study , rely 2-dimensional bone image technique . To identify mechanistic factor , may explain effect adiposity bone development , measure arterial stiffness , endothelial function , fast level glucose , insulin , lipid , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) ass vascular dysfunction , insulin resistance , abnormal lipid , inflammation relate bone modeling activity , measure serum marker bone formation resorption . All measurement assess baseline 1 2 year follow-up .</detailed_description>
