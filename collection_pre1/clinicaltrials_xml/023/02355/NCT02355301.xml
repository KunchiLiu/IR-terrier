	<brief_summary>The main objective investigator improve quality care patient orthopedic disorder follow St Luc hospital ( Brussels Belgium ) . To , investigator want assess impact Orthopedic treatments structural level ( bone structure , muscle , etc . ) , functional level ( mobility , strength , stiffness ... ) , restriction activity patient ( walk , make care daily.. ) limitation participation life every day ( sport , work , social life , cultural ... ) . This functional evaluation patient orthopedic disorder ICF model original approach rarely use muscular-skeletal impairment improve management patient quality life . In addition , investigator associate harvest medical computer data collect high-precision tool surgical treatment , good define surgical precision improve quality surgical care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator recruit patient orthopedic disorder voluntary basis department St Luc Hospital Brussels , old 0 90 year , men woman muscular-skeletal impairment ( arthrosis , bone muscle injury , ... . ) . The investigator exclude patient multiple pathology able understand instruction . They thus impropre effectiveness treatment Orthopaedics well define route effective surgical first patient arthroplasty ( mini invasive , posterior , anterior ) , appropriate knee prosthesis type ( design prothesis ) , conservative treatment properly improve quality life patient orthopedic disorder ( plaster , brace , physiotherapy ... ) . They evaluate impact treatment structural level ( bone structure , muscle , etc . ) , functional level ( mobility , strength , stiffness ... ) , restriction activity patient ( walk , make care daily.. ) limitation participation life every day ( sport , work , social life , cultural ... ) follow ICF-WHO model . In addition , dispose data necessary good define surgical precision ( international organization standardization ISO Norm ) , quality surgical care analyze data collect high-precision tool surgical treatment . Patients subject different clinical assessment , fill questionnaire come laboratory analysis movement depend goal define patient . Patients current clinical follow-up ( RX , scanner , mobility , force measurement , stiffness ... ) investigator able join quantify analysis movement laboratory , satisfaction questionnaire , questionnaire measure impact treatment quality life restriction activity . It broad-spectrum study try improve quality care within service target orthopedics .</detailed_description>
