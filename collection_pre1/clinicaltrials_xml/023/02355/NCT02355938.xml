	<brief_title>Use Of Oral Fidaxomicin Vs . Oral Vancomycin For Clostridium Difficile Infection In Patients With Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent clinical trial , compare oral Vancomycin versus oral Fidaxomicin treat Clostridium difficile , oral Fidaxomicin show effectiveness oral Vancomycin , show decrease recurrence Clostridium difficile ten percentage point . Based experience patient 40-bed spinal cord injury unit Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center ( MEDVAMC ) , Clostridium difficile infection problematic patient spinal cord injury general hospitalize patient population . Compared general population hospitalize patient , patient spinal cord injury likely : ( 1 ) high transmission Clostridium difficile one patient another often via health care worker due neurogenic bowel ( 2 ) longer complicate course Clostridium difficile infection-associated diarrhea since neurogenic bladder may delay excretion toxin predispose bowel accident ; ( 3 ) high overall cost treatment term extend hospitalization ( patient spinal cord injury suffer Clostridium difficile infection get discharge hospital symptom course Clostridium difficile infection resolve . Fidaxomicin first new class narrow spectrum macrocyclic antibiotic drug . It non-systemic , mean minimally absorb bloodstream , bactericidal , mean attack kill bacteria come contact . It demonstrate selective eradication pathogenic Clostridium difficile minimal disruption numerous specie bacteria make normal , healthy intestinal flora . The maintenance normal physiological condition colon reduce probability recurrence Clostridium difficile infection . Since clearance Clostridium difficile infection problematic spinal cord injure patient , antimicrobial agent may show trend clinical superiority reduction recurrence infection within spinal cord injury population result short hospital stay reduce cost .</detailed_description>
