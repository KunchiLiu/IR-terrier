	<brief_title>A Crossover Study Evaluate Relative Oral Bioavailability Food Effect After Single Dose Administration JNJ-54861911 Tablet Healthy Elderly Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study medication assign participant chance ) , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , 3-treatment , 3-period , 6-sequence crossover ( participant may receive different intervention sequentially trial ) , single-center study JNJ-54861911 . The duration study approximately 7 week per participant . The study consist 3 part : Screening ( , 21 day study commences Day 1 ) ; Open-label Treatment ( consist 3 single-dose treatment , either JNJ-54861911 formulation 1 [ reference ] JNJ-54861911 formulation 2 [ test ] fed fast condition ) , subsequent 3-treatment period , separate washout period 7 day ) ; End-of-Study ( up-to 14 day last study drug administration ) . All eligible participant randomly assign 1 6 treatment sequence . In fasted condition , study drug administer follow 10-hour overnight fast . In fed condition , participant also fast food 10 hour , consume high fat/high calorie breakfast within 30-minute period . Study drug administer 30 minute start breakfast . Participants allow food 4 hour drug administration . Blood sample collect evaluation pharmacokinetics pre-dose post-dose study treatment . Relative bioavailability two formulation JNJ-54861911 ( test reference ) evaluate primarily . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
