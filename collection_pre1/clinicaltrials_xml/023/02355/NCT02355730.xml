	<brief_summary>This study develop optimise design manufacturing process handheld device monitor manage Warfarin ( blood thin anticoagulation drug ) therapy . The device comprise handheld instrument disposable test strip report blood coagulation work term standardise unit call International Normalised Ratio ( INR ) . A single drop fresh whole blood plasma add strip INR result display instrument . Blood sample collect patient attend hospital base INR clinic Warfarin Therapy . The sample use series experiment laboratory test Microvisk POC INR Monitors accuracy , precision , stability robustness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The number patient receive anticoagulation therapy warfarin vitamin K antagonists rise recent year . Increasing life expectancy increase proportion population condition Atrial Fibrillation venous thrombosis , primary secondary prevention thromboembolic complication best achieve anticoagulation . Unpredictable pharmacokinetics , widespread interaction drug food narrow therapeutic window make closely monitoring Vitamin K antagonists necessity . Portable point care ( POC ) coagulometers measure PT capillary whole blood provide INR reading within minute already widely available throughout North American Europe . They give comparable result compare laboratory base system popular patient significantly shorten duration clinic . In addition , United Kingdom Department Health encourage use anticoagulation service Primary Care Trusts aim provide INR monitoring community clinic General Practice surgeries relieve pressure hospital service reduce inconvenience patient . Although coagulometers commercially available Microvisk INR Testing System design advantage , particularly term test robustness , user comfort , ease use reduction user error . The present trial design develop second generation Microvisk INR Test System ; blood sample also use optimise manufacture process verify quality Test Strip Lots .</detailed_description>
