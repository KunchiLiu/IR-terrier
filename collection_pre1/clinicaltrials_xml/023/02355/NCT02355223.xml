	<brief_summary>The study design evaluate clinical impact novel strategy tuberculosis ( TB ) infection control know FAST ( Find case Actively base cough surveillance , Separate temporarily , Treat effectively ) . It anticipate decrease time effective treatment initiation also decrease transmission TB health care worker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Finding Treating Unsuspected Resistant TB Reduce Hospital Transmission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There longstanding evidence tuberculosis ( TB ) transmission TB patient effective treatment , unsuspected case , case unsuspected drug resistance . This study seek investigate implementation refocus TB transmission control approach call FAST ( Find case Actively base cough surveillance , Separate temporarily , Treat effectively base molecular drug-susceptibility test [ DST ] ) . We conduct study Hospital Nacional Hipólito Unanue Lima , Peru . Our hypothesis FAST reduce delay identify infectious TB patient ( unsuspected drug resistance ) enter hospital , facilitate timely effective therapy , thereby reduce risk TB transmission cost-effective manner . We assess decrease transmission evaluate decrease tuberculin skin test conversion ( TST ) among health care worker . We also evaluate acceptability barrier to/facilitators FAST , novel screening strategy , health care worker TST use mixed method approach .</detailed_description>
