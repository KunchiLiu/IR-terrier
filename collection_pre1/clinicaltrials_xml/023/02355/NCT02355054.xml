	<criteria>1 . Patient must biopsyproven adenocarcinoma prostate initially treat curative intent ( surgery radiation therapy common treatment treatment also eligible ) . 2 . Biochemical recurrence define follow : PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL least two sequential test patient treat surgery . PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/mL post therapy nadir patient treat radiation therapy , brachytherapy cryotherapy . PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/ml recent therapy nadir patient receive additional treatment recurrent set . 3 . Patient must undergo standardofcare restaging clearly identify site ( ) active disease . Standard stag examination may include one follow : CT MRI , bone imaging ( either Tc99m bisphosphonate scintigraphy F18 sodium fluoride PET ) , OR In111 capromab pendetide scintigraphy . 4 . Age &gt; 18 year . 5 . Patient must able tolerate PET/MRI PET/CT image 6 . Patient must able understand willing sign write informed consent document . 7 . Patient must able understand willing sign Advance Beneficiary Notice ( ABN ) ( Medicare patient ) Notice Noncoverage ( NNC ) ( nonMedicare patient ) address potential cost patient C11 choline PET/CT PET/MRI . 1 . For patient plan PET/MRI : Patient must claustrophobia contraindication MRI evaluate standardized MRI safety questionnaire . If applicable , patient must renal insufficiency ( estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 base measurement within past 60 day ) undergoing dialysis condition preclude safe administration MRI contrast agent . NOTE : At discretion principal investigator , subject may allow enroll/continue study undergo image without administration contrast event renal insufficiency . If applicable , patient must know prior reaction gadolinium base MRI contrast agent . 2 . For patient plan PET/CT : Patient must claustrophobia would preclude PET/CT image contraindication CT imaging .</criteria>
