We enroll child confirm risk ASD randomize trial employ 1:1 randomization child . The FN protocol include individualize navigation support completion diagnostic evaluation , referral appropriate service , linkage engagement service . We determine FN 's effect identify child risk ASD , time diagnosis , receipt evidence-based ASD service . The study seek accomplish follow aim : 1 . Implement decision rule referral formal ASD evaluation ; 2 . Ensure timely diagnosis deployment service . If successful , study provide real world primary care practice replicable model care increase early identification access timely diagnostic early intervention service vulnerable population urban family . Children follow 12 month . Data regard screen outcome , diagnosis service utilization abstract child 's medical record . Measures parental stress , self-management skill , caregiver burden , satisfaction service administer 4 collection time point , link key intervention outcome . We assess superiority FN compare CCM mean : implement decision rule referral ASD evaluation ; shorten time diagnosis among child suspect ASD ; shorten time deployment ASD service among diagnosed ; improve engagement ASD service .</detailed_description>
