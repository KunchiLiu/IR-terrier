	<detailed_description>Aim 1 Hypothesis 1 include separate submission include protocol consent Aim 2 . To compare efficacy train arm versus hand promote upper extremity rehabilitation . Hypothesis 2 : Combining treatment arm hand , even cost decrease total amount time spend either , lead great improvement focus primarily arm hand alone . Aim 3 . To examine efficacy combine passive stretch active-assistive ( resistive training shoulder , elbow , wrist , hand . Hypothesis 3 : Multi-joint intelligent stretch follow active ( assistive resistive ) movement facilitate use IntelliArm X-Glove improve motor control upper extremity standard movement therapy alone . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Stoke lead cause adult disability third lead cause death ( kill 160,000 Americans/year ) United States ; 750,000 first ever recurrent stroke occur United States year . The economic burden huge estimate cost medical expense lose wage total $ 62.7 billion U.S. Stroke commonly associate motor-related disability , typically affect shoulder , elbow , wrist , finger arm simultaneously . Patients may develop spastic hypertonia reduce range motion ( ROM ) multiple joint . Several stereotypical pattern arm impairment multiple joint involve commonly see stroke survivor , include adducted/internally rotate shoulder , flexed elbow , pronate forearm , flexed wrist , clench fist . Furthermore , impair arm stroke survivor commonly develop abnormal coupling among multiple joint among multiple DOFs ( e.g . shoulder abduction , flexion , rotation ) give joint . Stroke survivor may exhibit limited capacity create independent movement individual joint coordinate activity multiple joint . There strong need treat hypertonia , involuntary coactivation , poor coordination frequent basis reduce spasticity/contracture increase mobility stroke . This goal propose study . METHODS Aims 2 3 address longitudinal intervention trial . Outcomes data subject collect multiple time point study . Specifically , evaluation session conduct one time initiation therapy ( Pre-Treatment Evaluation ) one time within conclusion therapy ( Post-Treatment Evaluation ) , two month later ( Follow-up Evaluation ) . Selection Subjects 72 subacute stroke survivor recruit accord inclusion exclusion criterion list 5 year . Intervention Each subject complete 18 therapy session 6 week , addition 6 evaluation session 1 screen session . Subjects assign evenly one six group . Groups split 2 condition base stretch 3 condition base target intervention ( arm , hand , arm hand ) . Half 72 subject assign stretch group half sham stretch group . One third subject assign arm-alone , hand-alone , arm-and-hand condition . Arm-alone group use IntelliArm , hand-alone group use X-Glove , arm-and-hand group use IntelliArm X-Glove alternate session robot ( 9 session IntelliArm , 9 session X-Glove ) . For assigned stretch group , subject complete 15 minute passive stretch IntelliArm X-Glove . For assigned sham-stretching condition , subject robot accord group assignment wear 15 minute precede active therapy session robot move arm hand range minimal force produce . For group , initial 15 minute stretch relax follow approximately 45 minute active therapy IntelliArm X-Glove ( depend group assignment ) , total session time 60 minute . The subject participate Aims 2 3 ask come lab Rehabilitation Institute Chicago provide inform consent complete screening , take approximately 30 minute include basic questionnaire clinical evaluation . If qualify enrol , subject complete 5 evaluation session 22 training session . Training The training study last 6 week 3 visit per week 18 session total . At begin train session , subject ask muscle joint soreness hemiparetic arm hand since last session . If subject persistent severe pain , he/she continue he/she feel sufficiently recover clinician agrees . IntelliArm Training During training , subject sit upright barber 's chair his/her trunk strap backrest chair . The subject 's arm , forearm hand strap brace connect robotic arm ; adjustment make customize robotic arm subject . Once adjustment complete , train begin , consist passive stretching ( half subject ) follow active movement therapy . Each training session last one one half hour . In stretch mode , robotic arm move subject 's shoulder , elbow wrist . Sometimes joint move one time sometimes move together . The joints/DOFs excessive couple and/or increase stiffness associate arm posture identify target particular attention . The IntelliArm stretch impair arm novel multi-joint intelligent control stretch joint forcefully safely well-coordinated pattern . On one hand , safe treatment , stretch velocity decrease increase resistance torque multiple joint involve joint stretch accord condition condition couple joint . On hand , effective treatment , stretch stop pre-specified peak resistance torque reach joints/DOFs involve . The stretched arm hold extreme position period time let stress relaxation occur joint move extreme position . In active training mode , subject ask move robotic arm around interact virtual target object . For example , target point display subject ask move hand current position target , match individual joint angle well . A circle virtual hand need overlap red-dot target computer monitor successful match . The IntelliArm make backdrivable implementing zero-torque control six-DOF force/torque sensor joint . Alternatively , assistance ( resistance ) provide IntelliArm impair arm voluntary movement training help subject arm impairment reach target . The level assistance adjust depend severity impairment . Subjects also move IntelliArm order play computer game catch baseball football , transport virtual object one location another display . As user progress motor control capability , workspace increase resistance instead assistance may provide movement make challenge patient . X-Glove Training Two-thirds subject utilize X-Glove therapy . This actuated glove provide independent extension force digit . Cables run linear actuator locate forearm cable guide locate back side digit fingertip ( Fig . 3 ) . A wrist splint keep wrist neutral position movement cable translates correspond movement digit . Force cable measure in-line sensor , cable position estimate motor displacement . As IntelliArm , X-Glove operate two mode , one provide stretch provide assistance hand open active training . For subject assign stretch group , X-Glove first run mode provide cyclic stretch rate approximately 90 repetition passive range motion 30 minute . The motor move digits initial flexed resting posture subject 's extension limit , determine force sensor range motion limit set therapist daily . The subject remain relaxed throughout stretch period . Evaluation Measurement In initial screening session , clinician check subject 's health status conduct clinical examination order determine subject fit inclusion exclusion criterion . During screen session subject participate several clinical assessment . The screening evaluation take one half hour . For evaluation session he/she ask come laboratory 13th floor Rehabilitation Institute Chicago . Evaluation subject neuromechanical clinical component ; neuromechanical clinical component evaluation take approximately two hour split two session take place week treatment . Protection Against Risk : A number safeguard implement . Mechanical/electrical stop use restrict motion robot safe range . Velocity limit also set restrict speed movement . Joint angle , velocity , force monitor continuously ensure fall within appropriate range . Exceeding threshold result motor shut-down . Additionally , motor turn time use accessible on/off switch protect discomfort potential injury . The IntelliArm X-Glove previously use safely number stroke survivor . Rest break provide need therapy prevent excessive muscle soreness fatigue . A cast saw use remove fiberglass cast use evaluation . Improper use saw could produce burn . Project staff train operation saw proper procedure follow . Adhesive use secure surface electrode could irritate skin . The skin carefully prepare apply electrode clean electrode remove . Specific TMS , although rare instance seizure report long train high frequency excitatory TMS apply , event report recommended guideline originally publish 1996 updated Rossi et al . 2009 Clin . Neurophysiol . 120:2008-2039 , follow . The parameter propose study well within publish safety guideline , individual suffer stroke one commonly requite population TMS study . Providing never seizure meet exclusion criterion list , clinical population TMS safely apply . Data Analysis : To relate find relationship physiological data functional performance data evaluate use ) biomechanics data analysis , b ) correlation principle component analysis , c ) regression , ) Rasch analysis , e ) structural equation modeling . Physiological data obtain IntelliArm ( e.g . abnormal couple joints/DOFs , passive workspace active workspace , multiple joint DOF/stiffness ) analyze describe characterize arm impairment . The physiological data also compare therapist-rated data ( WMFT , ARAT , CAHAI , FMUE ) investigate relationship . To determine proper physiological measurement rehabilitation stroke relate functional performance , correlation analysis principal component analysis conduct initial step find physiological variable high correlation functional measure cluster together similar indicator . Those potential indicator filter data reduction procedure . The select data use multiple regression analysis predict functional outcome activity level ( assessed WMFT , ARAT , CAHAI ) participation level ( assessed datalogger ) adjust person information environmental factor serve categorical variable . Rasch analysis use evaluate item difficulty hierarchy item fit link subject 's functional ability level specific functional task , allow u find clinical potential thresholds/cut-off point consistent pattern exist physiological data functional measure . Furthermore , ICF model evaluate use structural equation modeling , test set regression equation simultaneously exam relationship among impairment ability , participation variable personal environmental factor take consideration . Two month 22 session training , subject ask return lab follow-up evaluation . The evaluation describe do session .
