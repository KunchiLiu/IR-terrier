	<brief_title>Recolonisation Bacteria Hands Possible Bacterial Leakage From Glove Cuff Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With emerge antibiotic resistant bacteria necessary try prevent surgical site infection ( SSIs ) .Not suffer death also increase cost . For deep sternal infection cost double even triple . Sternal wound complication occur low number almost 10 % , different severity , depend follow routine In intraoperative environment causative bacteria often originate either patient surgical team . One many prevent measure keep patient surgical member sterile possible it´s number bacteria overcome host defense lead infection . The common bacteria cause sternal infection Coagulase negative staphylococci ( CoNS ) 46 % Staphylococcus aureus , 26 % gram- negative bacteria , 18 % . One preventing measure wear surgical glove , wear double gloving easy detection puncture outer glove . When use indicator glove become dark spot hole tell change glove . At glove cuff end often indicate fluid sort get dark sleeve gown meet glove cuff . One may suspect fluid thrives hand , fluid contains bacteria hand . In open heart surgery surgical team wear glove long period time . Research implicate occur recolonisation bacteria inside glove . Does recolonisation hand flora occur surgical hand wash bacterial leakage glove cuff site ? It´s discuss people contact hospital carry bacteria others admit hospital surgery risk factor . It also know hospital worker carrier bacteria possibly also carrier resistant bacteria . At hand hospital worker often wash disinfect hand . Are differences bacterial recolonization hand flora hospital staff operate department people average society little contact hospital ?</detailed_description>
