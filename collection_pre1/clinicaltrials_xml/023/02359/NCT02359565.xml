II . To estimate sustained objective response rate , ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] , sustain least 9 week ) associate pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) treatment pediatric patient recurrent , progressive refractory NB-HGG DIPG . III . To establish safety describe adverse effect associate administration adult recommend dose MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) pediatric patient progressive recurrent hypermutated tumor , include conditional mismatch-repair deficiency ( CMMRD ) syndrome .

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess relationship outcome ( response progression-free survival [ PFS ] ) potential biomarkers , include program cell death ( PD ) -ligand 1 ( L1 ) expression , patient immunophenotype , ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) signature profile , tumor gene expression profile . II . To estimate duration objective response , progression-free/event-free survival document overall survival patient NB-HGG DIPG treat MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) . III . To evaluate PD-L1 expression archival tissue obtain patient non-brainstem high-grade glioma . IV . To examine ability quantitative magnetic resonance ( MR ) spectroscopy diffusion/weighted imaging/apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) map provide early assessment tumor behavior specifically distinguish pseudoprogression/tumor inflammation tumor progression . V. To explore use serial MR permeability ( dynamic contrast-enhanced [ DCE ] ) MR perfusion ( dynamic susceptibility contrast [ DSC ] ) determine elevate relative cerebral blood volume ( rCBV ) transfer coefficient ( ktrans ) distinguish pseudoprogression/tumor inflammation tumor progression tumor treat protocol . VI . To characterize biomarkers , patient immunophenotyping , mutational load ( determined whole exome sequencing ) tumor gene expression profile patient HGG receive MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) . VII . To estimate duration objective response , PFS/event free survival document overall survival pediatric patient progressive recurrent hypermutated NB-HGG , include CMMRD syndrome , treat MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) . VIII . To estimate PFS sustain objective response rate pediatric patient hypermutated progressive low grade glioma include CMMRD , treat MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) . IX . To categorize T-cell receptor repertoire PD-1+ cell obtain peripheral blood tumor tissue , available , treatment MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) pediatric patient treat stratum C ( hypermutated brain tumor ) . X . To define specificity T-cell receptor tumor antigen identify objective IX . XI . To characterize functional feature T-cell population MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) treatment relate finding epigenetic program within cell .
