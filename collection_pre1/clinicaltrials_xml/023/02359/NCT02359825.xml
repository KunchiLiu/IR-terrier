	<brief_summary>Current strategy peripheral nerve repair severely limited . Even current technique , take month regenerate axon reach denervated target tissue injury proximally locate . This inability rapidly restore loss function axonal injury continue produce poor clinical outcome . The investigator propose test efficacy safety combination therapy : polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) assist axonal fusion technique repair peripheral nerve injury human .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our preclinical animal study design take advantage PEG . We use fusogenic property PEG allow u demonstrate rapid decisive electrophysiological recovery either crush completely sever sciatic nerve commonly accept mammalian model peripheral nerve injury ( Bittner et al JSR 2012 ) . Recently , modify previously publish mammalian technique . Our goal eliminate laboratory solution approve use human replace readily available reagent commonly use clinical application . PEG commercially available many molecular formulation earlier experiment PEG molecular weight 2 kD . Unfortunately , molecular weight approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) human usage . In recent preclinical study , demonstrate PEG 3.35 kD , main ingredient commonly use cathartic know MiraLAXÂ© ( MERCK ; Whitehouse Station , NJ ) , actually generate superior fusion PEG 2KD cut nerve model . Thus clinical trial form basis proposal develop FDA approve 3.35 kD PEG two FDA approve solution . Additional study complex nerve injury model also demonstrate repair perform immediately nerve injury . Epineural repair PEG 3.35 kD treatment perform 24hrs injury postoperative CAPs obtain PEG 3.35 kD treat animal ( n=3 , data show ) . The remarkable find 24-hour injury model , PEG significantly improve behavioral outcome measure 72 hour postoperatively . Based publish report vivo study , demonstrate PEG base repair restore CAPs immediately improve functional recovery significantly post injury . These preclinical finding suggest offer novel therapy test human experience complete transection peripheral nerve . Patient risk minimize optimized PEG facilitate fusion technique utilize commonly used FDA approve drug , solution electrolytes augment standard neurorrhaphy technique . The experimental protocol entail 100 % transection injury peripheral nerve follow standard neurorrhaphy . The repair irrigate gently PEG two minute sterile water standard fashion use wash away PEG . The likely scenario , explain rapid compound action potential ( CAP ) restoration , rapid restoration cytoplasmic flow within nerve , rapid ability membrane depolarize possibly prevention Wallerian degeneration .</detailed_description>
