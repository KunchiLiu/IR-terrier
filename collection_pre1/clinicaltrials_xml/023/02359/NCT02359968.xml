	<brief_summary>Resectable esophageal junctional cancer require medical treatment radiotherapy chemotherapy follow surgery . Currently , one commonly use chemotherapy treatment FOLFOX . It combination three drug administer intravenously : fluorouracil , oxaliplatin folinic acid . This standard treatment . Another protocol chemotherapy widely use certain European American team , due promise result : combination two drug administer intravenously : Paclitaxel Carboplatin ( CarboP-pacliT ) . At present , clinical study show superiority one treatment . The objective Phase II study clarify clinical practice compare two chemotherapy treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PReoperative Chemoradiation ( Paclitaxel-carboplatin FOLFOX ) Resectable Esophageal Junctional Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There standard preoperative ( neoadjuvant ) chemoradiation ( NCRT ) regimen resectable esophageal cancer , trial fail show survival advantage favor pCRT compare surgery . This failure relate lack power trial , well ability chemoradiation potentiate post-operative morbidity ( include mortality ) , therefore hamper accrual survival benefit . Hopefully , meta-analyses show NCRT increase survival compare surgery . However , clinical practice , make easy choice best NCRT treatment . It appear radiation regimen use randomized trial heterogeneous respect dose , fraction , length treatment , field , dosimetry planning , quality control . This apply also chemotherapy respect kind cytotoxics use ( include number drug ) , well dosage , number cycle , although time cytotoxics fluorouracil cisplatin . Dutch colleague recently show NCRT weekly carboplatin paclitaxel increase survival , without increase postoperative mortality . Of note , tumor trial arise low third esophagus esogastric junction habitually correlate less postoperative morbidity compare upper third tumor . Moreover , lung volume spar radiation great junctional tumor upper third cancer - critical point development radiation-induced pneumonitis subsequent postoperative mortality . It difficult understand taxane-based chemotherapy active , make good fluorouracil-based regimen non-operable patient , NCRT taxanes make radiation-induced pneumonitis likely . The favorable impact NCRT may lie radiation regimen . A moderate total dose radiation , small radial margin trial modern dosimetry 3D-planning improve safety treatment subsequent surgery . Finally , favorable impact Dutch NCRT regimen may lie fact include cisplatin , compound find related occurrence sudden death non cisplatin-based regimen FOLFOX combination ( fluorouracil , oxaliplatin , folinic acid ) set definitive chemoradiotherapy . Our aim evaluate short-term benefit ( complete resection rate ) safety ( severe postoperative rate ) 2 preoperative regimen , ( carboplatin-paclitaxel fluorouracil-oxaliplatin-folinic acid ) , combine Dutch radiation backbone , operable esophageal junctional ( Siewert I-II ) cancer . The present trial offer unique opportunity compare two therapeutic strategy already show efficient large randomize controlled trial offer level-1 evidence .</detailed_description>
