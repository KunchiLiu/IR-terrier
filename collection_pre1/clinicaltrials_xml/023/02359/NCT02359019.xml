	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer After Completion Combination Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 define progression-free survival ( PFS ) extensive stage small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) patient , complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) stable disease follow minimum 4 cycle platinum ( cisplatin carboplatin ) etoposide . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess modified PFS patient enrol . II . To assess overall survival patient enrol trial . III . To assess programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression archival tumor tissue circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) correlate expression RECIST define PFS . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 12 week .</detailed_description>
