	<detailed_description>The participant randomly assign lab group home group . For lab-based training ( lab group ) , participation involve 18 training session six week 3 sessions/week . In addition , 3 visit outcome evaluation carry six-week training , six week multi-week train follow-up . For home-based training ( home group ) , train last six week take place least three time week home , participant instruct trained use portable rehabilitation robot properly . Participants come research lab outcome evaluation , six week training , follow . For home group , participant initially train research team lab set use rehabilitation robot . The training do first one two session . The research team go participant family member operate rehabilitation robot home . The participant family member practice use rehabilitation robot lab set feel comfortable use robot independently . Before take device home , participant ask go step train without assistance research staff . After training , participant family member take portable rehabilitation robot home use vehicle conduct training home . Audiovisual interaction instruction do Internet participant need help conduct training . Training data result save rehabilitation robot , upload server manage research team . Training parameter adjust base progress . For group , 18 training session , participant seat foot attach footplate leg fix leg-support . The ankle joint rotate slowly joint extreme upward downward stretch joint . The participant also ask move joint voluntarily play videogames computer . Each treatment session last approximately one hour . Outcome Evaluations Evaluations do , train treatment session , follow-up . During evaluation session , ankle move robot evaluate passive property include passive range motion joint stiffness . The participant also move ankle voluntarily active control ability include active range motion muscle strength evaluate . Clinical examination do evaluate clinical scale include modify Ashworth scale , selective control Assessment low extremity ( SCALE ) , balance , walk ability ( distance cover 6 minute ) .</detailed_description>
