	<detailed_description>Environmental intervention address high availability unhealthy snack environment need prevent large projected increase incidence obesity cardiometabolic disease U.S . Prior study investigator group others suggest human preference immediate gratification food drive dietary overconsumption , knowledge yet translate effective dietary intervention strategy . This project test whether novel snack vend machine system use brief time delay reduce immediacy reward unhealthy snack improve healthfulness snack choice . The project include two study . First , laboratory study conduct identify optimum time delay apply unhealthy snack . One-hundred sixty-eight individual purchase snack classify healthy unhealthy vary delay interval . Specific Aim 1 select delay interval produce large improvement purchase rate healthy snack without harm overall vending sale , key aspect intervention feasibility real world . The second study use experimental design compare brief time delay , two form 25 % differential pricing , time delay combine form 25 % differential pricing ability increase purchase healthy snack . Two test machine place exist , high-volume vending location , five experimental condition run four week . Additionally , baseline purchase intervention monitor four week four week five experimental condition . Specific Aim 2a compare effect five intervention proportion total vend sale healthy snack . Specific Aim 2b evaluate whether intervention effect translate clinically meaningful improvement calorie nutrient purchasing . Specific Aim 3a test whether time delay differential pricing harm overall vending machine sale test machine , Specific Aim 3b evaluate whether snack machine sale `` displace '' nearby vend machine experimental condition . This study test compel theory effect time delay immediate reward food choice , evaluate efficacy feasibility novel intervention improve healthfulness snack choice worksites , school , setting .</detailed_description>
