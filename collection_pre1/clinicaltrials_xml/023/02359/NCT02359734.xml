	<brief_summary>To identify key issue around use computerized patient infusion device ( call `` smart pump '' ) . To develop strategy improve prevention intravenous error broadly applicable . The investigator conduct national study use general methodology develop Husch et al . allow rapid assessment frequency type medication error institution . The key question investigator address : 1 . What frequency type intravenous medication error ? 2 . How much variability frequency type among setting ? 3 . After review initial data , strategy appear great potential reduce intravenous medication error frequency ? 4 . How effective intervention include bundle strategy multiple site ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overall Study Design : This multi-hospital study investigate medication error use smart pump . The propose study conduct three phase total 36 month phase . In Year 1 , observational study conduct investigator ten multiple hospital site . The investigator prospectively compare medication , dose , infusion rate IV pump prescribe medication , dos , rate medical record . Preventability smart pump technology retrospectively determine base rigorous definition currently available technology . The investigator also make comparison across site overall rate degree variability among site . Then , Year 2 , result evaluate , consensus process include face-to-face meeting take place evaluate type event develop intervention implement multiple site . After run-in period , intervention test Year 3 site , data analyze , investigator produce report set recommendation .</detailed_description>
