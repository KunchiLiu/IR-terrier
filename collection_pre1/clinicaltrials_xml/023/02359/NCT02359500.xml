	<detailed_description>Rationale overall study design This study plan demonstrate safety efficacy [ 68Ga ] -DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide ( [ 68Ga ] -DOTATOC ) accurate image technique diagnosis , stag , monitor response treatment patient Somatostatin receptor express tumor undergo image clinical indication . Neuroendocrine tumor ( NET ) rare neoplasms neuroendocrine origin . Neuroendocrine tumor solid malignant tumor arise disperse neuroendocrine cell find throughout body . They well know heterogeneity make difficult obtain uniform clinical data establish universal guideline diagnosis treatment NETs . NETs characterize overexpression somatostatin receptor , visualize target radiolabeled somatostatin analogue . 111In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-octreotide scintigraphy ( 111In-Octreotide ) single photon emission tomography ( SPECT ) currently standard image modality evaluate patient NETs . 111In Octreotide FDA approve radiopharmaceutical available market assess extent involvement NETs stag follow period . However , sensitivity image modality low compare positron emission tomography ( PET ) radiotracer 68Ga-DOTA0-Tyr3 ] octreotide ( 68Ga-DOTA-TOC ) . Based improved sensitivity , 68Ga DOTATOC PET lead significant change 30 % patient . Importantly , radiation exposure 68Ga-DOTATOC PET low 111In Octreotide also image 68Ga-DOTATOC PET scan yield fast read-outs day compare 24-48 hour read-out 111In Octreotide scan . These advantage make 68Ga label somatostatin analog attractive patient management perspective . The improved resolution quantitation uptake obtain Ga-68 DOTATOC PET provide accurate assessment somatostatin receptor density , lead accurate prediction treatment response somatostatin analogue . While investment cost scanner , radiochemistry equipment high 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT compare 111In-DTPA-octreotide scintigraphy SPECT , provision imaging molecule establish commercial radiopharmaceutical company compliance FDA 21 CFR Part 212 IBA Molecular Inc , NJ , USA , pose limitation Mount Sinai Medical Center . In set , 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT production personnel cost borne commercial entity , however , Mount Sinai Medical Center purchase 68Ga-DOTATOC base per patient schedule . Since image modality quote reimbursement insurance carrier , image cost consider potential burden patient approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . There significant amount European base clinical data ( &gt; 1000 patient ) prove safety efficacy image agent , therefore , phase II III clinical trial US redundant delay approval image probe . Recently , Ga-68 DOTATOC designate orphan drug FDA management NET . This designation probably lead faster approval agent , would greatly benefit NET patient US . Currently , several small U.S.-based clinical trial Ga-68 label NET PET agent available patient ; otherwise must travel country scan require manage disease . The investigator , therefore , aim provide superior imaging technique NET patient well disease management refer physician , however , objective attain unless least partial funding mechanism exists make affordable patient approval superior image probe . In regard , investigator aim recover cost radiotracer local insurance carrier cost recovery system . Participant Enrollment Participants recruit Mount Sinai Medical Center . Participants approach regard study individual see know suspected malignancy . Patients may remain somatostatin therapy throughout study management change merely base 68Ga -DOTATOC PET/CT imaging finding . The management patient base standard care change discretion refer physician . All pertinent dose information must collect report .</detailed_description>
