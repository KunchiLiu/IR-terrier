	<brief_summary>Opioids commonly utilized pharmacological treatment moderate severe pain . However , clinical value hinder development opioid-induced hyperalgesia ( OIH ) . OIH manifest heighten pain sensitivity , increasingly challenge drawback efficacy opioid treatment . Although mechanism action modulate OIH completely understand , previous animal study suggest phenomenon result proinflammatory response . Thus , administer adjunct anti-inflammatory agent may attenuate OIH . Minocycline one agent ; tetracycline derivative antibiotic inhibits microglia activation , nitric oxide ( NO ) production , release pro-inflammatory cytokine chemokines . In fact , recent evidence suggest minocycline may attenuate neuroinflammatory effect opioids enhance antinociceptive effect . Therefore , investigator determine minocycline mitigate OIH methadone-maintained patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sixty completers recruit VA methadone clinic , well APT Foundation Methadone Maintenance Program . After initial phone screening , potential subject undergo comprehensive evaluation include medical , psychiatric , drug use history well physical , psychiatric , laboratory examination . Laboratory examination include CBC , liver thyroid function test , serum electrolyte , BUN , creatinine , PT , PTT , urine analysis ( include urine pregnancy woman ) urine toxicology screening . Participants terminate study follow opioid relapse , use psychotropic medication . If participant noncompliant ( no-show , positive urine screening , noncompliance medication protocol/missing one dose minocycline/placebo ) , participation terminate . This double-blind , randomize clinical trial randomize male female veteran non-veterans currently undergo methadone maintenance treatment opioid dependence either minocycline ( 200mg/day ) placebo 15 day . Upon inclusion , participant subject pain assessment evaluate baseline pain threshold tolerance : Cold Pressor Test . An experimental treatment either minocycline placebo initiate maintain 15 day . Additionally , begin Week 2 treatment , participant give Personal Digital Assistant ( PDA ) HP iPAQ Pocket PC 2003 Pro administer Ecological Momentary Assessments ( EMA ) . Using EMA , assess change pain sensitivity , withdrawal symptom cognitive performance participant ' natural environment , increase ecological validity study . Participants ask return laboratory several time week 15 consecutive day take minocycline order receive study medication ass change pain threshold tolerance ( i.e . assess presence , lack thereof hyperalgesia ) . Upon completion experimental treatment , participant ask return final time undergo pain measurement , assess change pain sensitivity completion minocycline .</detailed_description>
