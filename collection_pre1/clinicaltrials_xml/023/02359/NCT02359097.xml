	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study steady state blood volume map use ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite magnetic resonance ( MRI ) image patient glioblastoma . MRI procedure radio wave powerful magnet link computer use create detailed picture area inside body . Contrast agent , ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite , may enhance picture increase visibility tumor cell blood vessel around tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Steady State Blood Volume Maps Using Ferumoxytol Non-stoichiometric Magnetite MRI Imaging Patients With Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Testing steady state ( SS ) -cerebral blood volume ( CBV ) map superior dynamic susceptibility contrast- ( DSC ) -CBV map visualize brain tumor blood volume . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Development SS-CBV mapping quantitative CBV estimation . II . Assessment therapeutic response . III . Association survival . IV . Correlation relative cerebral blood volume ( rCBV ) histology . V. Assessment late ferumoxytol ( ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite ) enhancement various stage disease . OUTLINE : Patients receive 2 dos gadoteridol intravenously ( IV ) undergo MRI include DSC dynamic contrast enhance imaging ( DCE ) -CBV map approximately 45-60 minute day 1 . Within 3 day , patient receive 3 dos ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite IV undergo MRI include DSC SS-CBV mapping dose approximately 90 minute . Patients undergo MRI without contrast 24 hour ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite approximately 30 minute . This 3 day series image repeat different stage disease may perform 5 time : prior surgery , prior chemoradiation therapy , 4-6 week post-chemoradiation therapy , time progression gadolinium MRI per Response Assessment Neuro-Oncology ( RANO ) criterion , time progression ( previous time progression show pseudoprogression ) . After completion study , patient follow 2 6 week .</detailed_description>
