	<brief_summary>This prospective , multicenter , multidisciplinary , control clinical investigation evaluate safety efficacy PerClot achieve intraoperative hemostasis compare similar market hemostatic device . Three hundred twenty four subject across maximum 25 investigational site undergo open elective cardiac , general , urological surgical procedure meet eligibility criterion intraoperatively randomize receive entire content two 5 gram bellow either investigational device control hemostatic agent bleed site , whose anatomic site small equal 25cm² whose anatomic application site small equal 47cm² , bleed within pre-defined bleeding severity range applicable conventional mean hemostasis attempt specified intraoperative procedure . Each investigational site expect enroll approximately 13-40 subject . All investigational site locate U.S . Follow-up occur hospital discharge 6 week post-device application . For oncologic subject , additional follow occur 24 month post device application .</brief_summary>
