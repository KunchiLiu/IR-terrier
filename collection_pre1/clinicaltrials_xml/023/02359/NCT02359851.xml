	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Advanced Uveal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate ( ORR ) patient advanced uveal melanoma receive pembrolizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient advanced uveal melanoma receive pembrolizumab . II . To evaluate safety , tolerability adverse experience profile pembrolizumab uveal melanoma . III . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) patient advanced uveal melanoma receive pembrolizumab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate ( ORR ; complete response + partial response ) patient advanced uveal melanoma receive pembrolizumab stratify program cell death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression guanine nucleotide-binding protein ( GNA ) Q/GNA11 mutation status . II . To evaluate ORR patient previously treat ipilimumab mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) inhibitor . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 12 week .</detailed_description>
