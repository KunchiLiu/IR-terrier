	<brief_summary>Subjects study allogeneic ( blood marrow cell another person ) blood marrow transplant treat leukemia , lymphoma cancer blood , develop Graft Versus Host Disease ( GVHD ) respond standard treatment . GVHD graft ( transplant bone marrow blood ) attack recipient 's body . GVHD occur early transplant ( acute ) and/or sometimes month transplant ( chronic ) . Both forms life threatening ; chronic GVHD lifelong disable condition . Mesenchymal stromal cell ( MSCs ) exist tissue throughout body . One place find bone marrow obtain needle aspiration , way bone marrow sample obtain test leukemia . This study use autologous MSCs obtain recipient acute and/or chronic GVHD , low chance reject . These MSCs may promote tolerance , help donor immune cell accept recipient 's body . This trial conduct step toward test long-term hypothesis freshly culture autologous MSC grown platelet lysate-containing medium modulate donor T-cell immune response reduce GVHD allo-HSCT recipient . As phase I dose escalation trial autologous MSC patient acute chronic GVHD , main aim evaluate safety therapy effect GVHD biomarkers T-cell phenotype</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>EPIC MSC2014-002 solution- Autologous Mesenchymal Stromal Cells expand use pool human platelet lysate , make autologous marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell ex vivo expand numerically approximately 14 day use pooled human Platelet Lysate ( phPL ) , harvested culture day infusion suspend concentration 4 million cells/ml Plasmalyte A 0.5 % human serum albumin . This phase I dose-escalation , open label , non-randomized , non-placebo control , single group assignment study evaluate safety tolerability EPIC MSC2014-002 . The product infuse intravenously administer one three dose level : ( Dose level 1 ) : Single Cell infusion 2 x 10^6 cells/kg , ( Dose Level 2 ) : Two weekly Cell infusion 2 x 10^6 cells/kg , ( Dose level 3 ) : Four weekly Cell infusion 2 x 10^6 cells/kg . This Phase I clinical trial enroll 12-24 subject acute chronic GVHD . The duration study patient 1 year . The investigator anticipate study complete within 3 year commencement . Objectives : - To determine safety tolerability infuse escalate dos autologous MSCs patient acute chronic GVHD . - To assess overall response rate acute chronic GVHD autologous MSC infusion . These data use plan future , large clinical trial evaluate efficacy autologous MSCs treatment GVHD . - To determine effect MSC infusion lymphocyte phenotype , inflammatory biomarkers GVHD specific biomarker level</detailed_description>

Must one follow diagnosis : Acute GVHD ( grade IIIV ) require systemic therapy refractory/unresponsive glucocorticoid ( &gt; 1 mg prednisoneequivalent/kg x 1 week ) Chronic GVHD extensive improve despite therapy glucocorticoid ( &gt; 0.5 mg prednisoneequivalent/kg/day ) therapeutic dos calcineurin inhibitor least 4 week , worsen within 2 week , overlap syndrome respond glucocorticoid treatment ( &gt; 1 mg prednisoneequivalent/kg x 1 week ) Active invasive fungal infection require treatment antifungal medication . Active viral infection require treatment antiviral medication . Persistence/relapse time study entry primary malignancy transplant perform . Patients history relapse malignancy achieve remission time evaluation study participation exclude . Known Tcell donor chimerism &lt; 50 % . Documented DLCO &lt; 50 % ( perform within 90 day enrollment ) requirement supplemental oxygen . Pregnancy breastfeed . Patients childbearing capability agree use contraception .</criteria>
