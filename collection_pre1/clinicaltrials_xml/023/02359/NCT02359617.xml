	<brief_title>Continuous Glucose Sensing Site Subcutaneous Insulin Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment type 1 diabetes usually comprise measurement glucose blood obtain finger prick administration insulin via subcutaneous bolus injection continuous subcutaneous infusion . This study seek test new treatment approach glucose sense insulin administration combine performed single subcutaneous tissue site ( single-port treatment approach ) . A single-port device consist continuous glucose sensor insulin infusion cannula insert subcutaneous tissue 10 type-1 diabetes patient used insulin infusion simultaneous glucose sense 7-day period . The performance single-port device assess compare obtain glucose reading blood glucose meter additionally worn control sensor .</detailed_description>
