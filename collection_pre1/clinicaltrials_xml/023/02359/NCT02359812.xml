	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Stoke lead cause adult disability third lead cause death ( kill 160,000 Americans/year ) United States ; 750,000 first ever recurrent stroke occur United States year . The economic burden huge , stroke estimate cost United Stated $ 62.7 billion medical expense lose wage . Stroke commonly associate motor-related disability . Motor impairment stroke survivor typically affect shoulder , elbow , wrist , finger arm simultaneously . Patients may develop spastic hypertonia reduce range motion ( ROM ) multiple joint . Several stereotypical pattern arm impairment multiple joint involve commonly see patient neurological impairment , include adducted/internally rotate shoulder , flexed elbow , pronate forearm , flexed wrist , clench fist . Furthermore , impair arm stroke survivor commonly develop abnormal coupling among multiple joint among multiple DOFs ( e.g . shoulder abduction , flexion , rotation ) give joint . Stroke survivor may lose independent movement individual joint appropriate coordination among joint . There strong need treat stereotypical deformity , impairment hypertonic arm multiple involved joint simultaneously frequent basis reduce spasticity/contracture increase mobility stroke , address propose study . METHODS The aim study address longitudinal evaluation stroke survivor first 6 month follow stroke . Specifically , upper extremity control neuromechanical property measure 7 different time point 6 month . Selection Subjects Twenty-four stroke survivor recruit 5 year study . All participant acute phase recovery time enrollment first-ever focal unilateral lesion ( ischemic hemorrhagic ) diagnose MRI CT . Participants recruit inpatient population RIC Northwestern Memorial Hospital . Subjects ask come lab Rehabilitation Institute Chicago consent participate initial screening . Designated study personnel obtain consent complete screen visit . If qualify enrol , subject ask complete 7 evaluation time indicate Outcome Measures Section . Subject participation last 6 month total . If subject persistent severe pain , he/she continue he/she feel sufficiently recover enough continued participation deem appropriate clinician . Evaluation Measurement In initial screening session , subject consent , clinician check subject 's health status conduct several clinical assessment determine subject meet inclusion exclusion criterion . The screening evaluation take one half hour . If subject qualifies study , participate evaluation session 7 time point space throughout study . For evaluation session he/she ask come laboratory 13th floor Rehabilitation Institute Chicago . Evaluation subject neuromechanical clinical component ; neuromechanical component evaluation take approximately two hour clinical component also take approximately two hour . Clinical neuromechanical evaluation may spill two separate visit . Neuromechanical evaluation The neuromechanical portion evaluation subject sit upright comfortably sturdy barber 's chair , trunk trap backrest . The arm , forearm hand strap correspond brace relevant ax IntelliArm align arm shoulder , elbow , wrist , finger . The position elbow , wrist , finger servomotors adjust different arm , forearm hand length . The subject 's arm move different speed include one joint time multiple joint simultaneously . Similarly , subject ask move his/her arm one joint time multiple joint simultaneously . During evaluation session , signal subject 's muscle call electromyography ( EMG ) may record monitor activity subject 's upper limb muscle . The skin muscle belly clean alcohol pad may shave disposable razor . Self-adhesive electrode place clean site connect instrument computer . The electrode use record signal generate muscle subject feel shock evaluation . Non-invasive electroencephalography ( EEG ) electrodes may attach scalp record brain activity signal . A video photo may take option evaluate movement pattern evaluation . In diagnose multi-joint multi-DOF biomechanics change , IntelliArm operate passive active mode . In passive mode , multi-joint arm robot move shoulder , elbow , wrist impaired arm stroke survivor throughout ROMs simultaneously individually well-controlled pattern multi-axis torque position measure , elbow wrist simultaneously . In active mode , patient move impair arm voluntarily multi-joint multi-DOF dynamic property measure shoulder , elbow wrist simultaneously . Measures stiffness hyperexcitability long finger flexor muscle , namely spasticity relaxation time , make use technique implement successfully past . Spasticity finger muscle measure reflex response impose rotation metacarpophalangeal ( MCP ) joint four finger . A servomotor create either fast MCP rotation ( 300°/s ) invoke stretch reflex slow constant-velocity rotation ( 10°/s ) measure nominally passive stiffness . Wrist orientation fix fiberglass cast subsequently clamp table prevent arm translation . MCP angle , angular velocity , torque record analysis spasticity . EMG recording obtain surface electrode ( Bagnoli , Delsys , Inc. , Boston , MA ) select superficial muscle extensor digitorum communis ( EDC ) flexor digitorum superficialis ( FDS ) . Relaxation time quantify examine FDS activity . The subject instruct maximally grip dynamometer upon hear audible tone . The subject relax grip quickly possible hear second tone . The relaxation time define elapsed time second tone point FDS magnitude return baseline level + three standard deviation . Clinical evaluation During clinical evaluation subject undergo battery standardize clinical assessment . These assessment require subject complete functional movement task use arm hand . Potential additional evaluation Additionally , subject may ask wear small motion tracker ( datalogger ) 6 hour . This record subject 's arm movement his/her living environment , thereby provide measure real-world activity , take personal environmental factor consideration . The datalogger consist motion sensor , attach subject 's arm via strap , small recorder clip belt . The subject take datalogger home . After wear time describe , subject take datalogger ( instructed evaluation session lab ) return next training session . As option , change corticospinal activation may evaluate use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) subject , provide subject meet inclusionary/exclusionary criterion , implant cardiac pacemaker metal implant head/face . TMS use evaluate corticomotor excitability . It deliver via Magstim BiStim stimulator ( Magstim Co , Dyfed , UK ) use deliver stimuli via figure-of-eight coil ( 70mm winding ) . Responses examine bilateral muscle use surface electrode . While stimulate affected ( unaffected ) hemisphere , motor evoke potential ( MEPs ) record muscle contralateral affect ( unaffected ) hemisphere . The participant seat comfortably evaluation . Foam earplugs insert patient 's external ear canal attenuate stimulator discharge sound . Surface electromyography electrode place muscle bilaterally record TMS MEP response . Protection Against Risk : A number safeguard implement . Mechanical/electrical stop use restrict motion robot safe range . Velocity limit also set restrict speed movement . Joint angle , velocity , force monitor continuously ensure fall within appropriate range . Exceeding threshold result motor shut-down . Additionally , motor turn time use accessible on/off switch protect discomfort potential injury . The IntelliArm hand jig previously use safely number stroke survivor . Rest break provide need therapy prevent excessive muscle soreness fatigue . A cast saw use remove fiberglass cast use evaluation . Improper use saw could produce burn . Project staff train operation saw proper procedure follow . Adhesive use secure surface electrode could irritate skin . The skin carefully prepare apply electrode clean electrode remove . Specific TMS , although rare instance seizure report long train high frequency excitatory TMS apply , event report recommended guideline follow . The parameter propose study well within publish safety guideline , individual 've suffer stroke one commonly requite population TMS study . Providing never seizure meet exclusion criterion list , clinical population TMS safely apply . Data Analysis : To relate find relationship physiological data functional performance , data evaluate use ) biomechanics data analysis , b ) correlation principle component analysis , c ) regression , ) Rasch analysis , e ) structural equation modeling . Physiological data obtain IntelliArm ( e.g . abnormal couple joints/DOFs , passive workspace active workspace , multiple joint DOF/stiffness ) analyze describe characterize arm impairment . Similar measure obtain finger characterize hand impairment . We especially examine measure change time . Curves fit data approximate function describe change neuromechanical measurement time . Similarly , score clinical evaluation ( GWMFT , ARAT , FMUE , MAS ) assess time course recovery period . The potential relationship among physiological data clinical data special interest . To determine proper physiological measurement stroke progression relate functional performance , correlation analysis principal component analysis conduct initial step find physiological variable high correlation functional measure cluster together similar indicator .
