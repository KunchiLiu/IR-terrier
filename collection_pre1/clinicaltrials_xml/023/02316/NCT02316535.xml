	<brief_summary>Approximately half colorectal cancer ( CRC ) patient first diagnose 70 year old . However , compare young patient , elderly patient often undertreated chemotherapy due impair tolerance . Recently , great controversy adjuvant chemotherapy strategy stage II/III CRC patient . As oral fluoropyrimidine , capecitabine demonstrate equivalent i.v . 5-Fu/leucovorin regimen stage III CRC patient . In light few adverse effect well flexibility , capecitabine regard ideal alternative elderly CRC patient , optimal dosage stage II/III elderly CRC patient still remain inconclusive . Our trial expect prospectively randomized 710 postoperative stage II/III elderly CRC patient ( 70 90 year age ) adjuvant mono-chemotherapy standard dose capecitabine ( 2500 mg/m2/day ) reduce dose ( 2000 mg/m2/day ) . This non-inferiority phase 3 trial primary endpoint 3-year disease free survival ( DFS ) , outcomes include 3-year overall survival ( OS ) , completion rate , toxic adverse effect quality life ( Qol ) . By trial , aim achieve precise evidence individualize adjuvant chemotherapy strategy stage II/III elderly CRC patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-dose Capecitabine Adjuvant Chemotherapy Elderly Patients With Stage II/III Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimated 1,200,000 newly diagnose colorectal cancer ( CRC ) case arise worldwide every year , CRC become third common malignance China . Especially urban area China , rapid growth CRC patient considerably increase burden disease . It well believe multi-discipline treatment ( MDT ) include surgery , chemoradiotherapy target therapy base individualized characteristic benefit CRC patient significantly . Generally , stage II ( T3-4N0M0 ) stage III ( TanyN1-2M0 ) colorectal carcinoma resect surgery . In 1990s , National Institutes Health ( NIH ) suggest adjuvant chemotherapy apply stage II/III CRC patient improve outcomes . As stage II CRC , result QUASA study indicate adjuvant chemotherapy could improve 5-year overall survival 3 % 4 % stage II CRC patient . Currently , global guideline National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline still recommend adjuvant chemotherapy stage II/III CRC patient . In western country , approximately 50 % CRC patient firstly diagnose 70 year old . It report 1980s , median age CRC diagnosis China 50 . However , 2005 reach 58 year old keep increase recent year . Limited age-related organ function decline comorbid condition , elderly people show impair physical mental tolerance chemotherapy . Generally stage II/III CRC patient , elderly young patient share common principle chemotherapy , large-scale retrospective analysis base ACCENT database show among CRC case include , patient age ≥ 70 account 17.1 % , much low normal . Similarly , Shrag colleague report investigation proportion patient ≥75 year old undergoing chemotherapy substantially low patient ≤ 75 year old . These evidence imply elderly CRC patient hold much low acceptance completion rate chemotherapy . With respect outcome , pool analysis include 3351 CRC case adjuvant chemotherapy report significant difference efficacy adverse effect among group various age , indicate elderly patient could achieve benefit adjuvant chemotherapy . Thus , essential improve acceptance completion rate modify chemotherapy regimen elderly CRC patient achieve good prognosis . There random control trial focusing adjuvant chemotherapy stage II/III elderly CRC patient . Results MOSAIC trial show add oxaliplatin 5-Fu/ leucovorin could significantly improve 5-year survival stage II/III colon cancer patient , make oxaliplatin-based combine chemotherapy ( Folfox , Xelox ) recommend late guideline . In subgroup analysis trial , however , significant improvement detect stage II patient . Recent analysis ACCENT database 2013 indicate elderly stage II/III CRC patient ( ≥ 70 yr ) acquire significant benefit add oxaliplatin fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy , suggest monochemotherapy might better option elderly CRC patient . Capecitabine ( Xeloda® ) unique oral prodrug 5-Fu recommend global guideline especially International Society Geriatric Oncology ( SIOG ) , verify clinical trial view efficacy safety , capecitabine monochemotherapy equivalent i.v . 5-Fu/ leucovorin adjuvant chemotherapy . With efficacy retain , large group patient prefer capecitabine due oral administration remarkably enhance flexibility compliance . These advantage make capecitabine potential ideal choice elderly patient . According NCCN guideline , standard dosage capecitabine 1250mg/m2 .bid . It well-established different characteristic ethnicity , age sex could alter metabolism change individual tolerance drug ; hence , still controversies optimal dose capecitabine different population . The X-Act trial provide result among elderly patient ( ≥ 70 yr ) undergo standard-dose capecitabine adjuvant chemotherapy ( 1250mg/m2 .bid ) , 51 % patient require dose reduction complete whole treatment cycle , imply recommend 1250mg/m2 .bid . might overdose elderly patient give fact elderly patient relatively well health ( ≤ 75 yr , ECOG≤1 ) eventually include X-ACT trial . Chang colleague verify feasibility tailored-dose strategy start dose 1000 mg/m2 .bid single-arm study . The European Society Medical Oncology ( ESMO ) also recommend option 80 % standard dosage ( i.e . 1000 mg/m2 .bid ) elderly II/III CRC patient . However , prospective trial conduct yet confirm reduced-dose strategy . Based current evidence controversy , design non-inferiority , phase 3 clinical trial explore optimal dosage capecitabine monochemotherapy stage II/III elderly CRC patient . Following result sample size estimation , 710 postoperative ( pT3-4NanyM0 pTanyN+M0 ) elderly patient 70 90 year age anticipate include randomly divide two group ( A B ) . Patients group A would receive standard dose regimen ( 1,250 mg/m2 twice daily day 1-14 , repeat day 22 ) ; accordingly patient group B would receive reduce dose regimen ( 1,000 mg/m2 twice daily day 1-14 , repeat day 22 ) . The primary endpoint 3-year disease free survival ( DFS ) , outcomes include 3-year overall survival ( OS ) , completion rate , toxic adverse effect quality life ( Qol ) .</detailed_description>
