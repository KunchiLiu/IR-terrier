	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Classically evaluation response lung cancer base compare pre &amp; post treatment tumour volume mean study change diameter select target lesion RECIST . The introduction new target drug creates need different response assessment . Functional image technique able study vivo physiological process angiogenesis . Therefore , dynamic technique may appropriate assess response antiangiogenic drug , whose mechanism action focus tumor 's vasculature normalization . Preliminary study demonstrate significant early change indirect vasculature parameter flow , blood volume tumor perfusion vascular-targeting agent . These technique may useful select patient go benefit antiangiogenic therapy early evaluation response mean functional image method . PURPOSE : IMPACT open-label , single arm phase II/IV study evaluate predictive value early radiologic response perfusion compute tomography ( CT ) patient diagnose unresectable advanced , metastatic recurrent non-squamous NSCLC treat bevacizumab combination chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES Primary objective : • To assess early tumour response ( day +7 ) term blood flow compare Objective Response Rate ( ORR ) term RECIST criterion ( CR + PR ) day 42 . Secondary objective : - To assess early tumour response ( day +7 ) term blood volume , mean transit time , enhancement peak , time enhancement peak capillary tumour permeability compare ORR ( CR + PR ) day 42 . - To assess tumour response ( day +42 ) term blood flow , blood volume , mean transit time , enhancement peak , time enhancement peak capillary tumour permeability compare ORR ( CR + PR ) day 42 . - To assess tumour response ( day +7 +42 ) term blood flow , blood volume , mean transit time , enhancement peak , time enhancement peak capillary tumour permeability compare PFS OS - Safety profile use NCI-CTC AE ( version 4.0 ) . - To assess efficacy subgroup adenocarcinoma pt . Outline : Patients receive bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg IV , cisplatin 80mg/m2 gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 day 1 8 6 cycle 21 day . Patients without progression may continue maintenance treatment single-agent bevacizumab 7.5 mg/Kg day 1 every 21 day .</detailed_description>
