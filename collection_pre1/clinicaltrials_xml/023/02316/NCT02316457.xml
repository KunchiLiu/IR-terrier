	<brief_summary>The Mutanome Engineered RNA Immuno-Therapy ( MERIT ) study introduces novel concept Individualized Cancer Immunotherapy ( IVAC® ) treat patient relevant immunogenic RNA vaccine give patient 's tumour . The TNBC-MERIT trial use two complementary strategy , IVAC® WAREHOUSE IVAC® MUTANOME concept , result two custom-made IVAC® investigational medicinal product ( IMPs ) ( IVAC_W_bre1_uID IVAC_M_uID ) individual patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- The IVAC® WAREHOUSE concept base RNA drug product shelve warehouse target share tumour-associated antigen ( TAAs ) . The BioNTech Group ( henceforward `` company '' ) identify set target antigens commonly express TNBC . The select breast cancer-associated antigen show immunogenicity test constitute suitable target immunotherapy form basis development novel RNA-based immunotherapy approach . - The IVAC® MUTANOME concept base identification tumour-specific mutation next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) on-demand RNA manufacturing use single patient target multiple neo-antigens derive mutated epitope . The novel therapeutic concept support series research project high level publication lead broad acceptance mutation-specific T cell bear enormous potential confer anti-tumoural activity cancer patients1-5 . - The TNBC-MERIT study introduce novel therapeutic concept individualize treatment breast cancer base ( ) treatment patient-specific liposome complexed RNA tailor antigen-expression profile give patient 's tumour ( IVAC® WAREHOUSE immunotherapy - IVAC_W_bre1_uID ) ( ii ) treatment de novo synthesize RNAs target 20 individual tumour mutation ( IVAC® MUTANOME immunotherapy - IVAC_M_uID ) follow treatment IVAC® WAREHOUSE . The scientific rationale combination two IVAC® approach base assumption immunotherapy ( 1 ) acknowledge tumour heterogeneity single-patient level ( 2 ) target whole range antigens selectively express tumour ( `` cancer antigenome '' ) , include immunogenic share unique antigen , bear high potential constitute effective treatment tumour .</detailed_description>
