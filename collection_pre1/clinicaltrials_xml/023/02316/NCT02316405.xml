	<brief_title>Can Arm Leg Cycling Exercise Improve Walking After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It find arm leg cycle similar walking term muscle activation pattern , joint range motion , neural pathway activate . Another advantage arm leg cycle involves coordination four limb rhythmic movement . This may particularly beneficial give previous finding arm movement contributes activation leg muscle walk human . This achieve interconnected neural pathway link arm leg . These neural interlimb connection remain intact stroke victim , maximize contribution arm legs may increase coordination walk . Thus , objective research determine arm leg cycling use increase strength inter-limb connection help improve walk ability post-stroke population . 15-20 participant recruit participate five week training intervention measure take intervention ass efficacy . Arm leg cycling could provide novel method improve inter-limb couple walk ability . These outcome would directly impact health quality life suffer stroke .</detailed_description>
