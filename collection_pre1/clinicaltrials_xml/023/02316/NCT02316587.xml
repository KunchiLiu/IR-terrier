	<detailed_description>Aortic stenosis common valvular disease Western World . It slow evolve degenerative disease cause gradual accumulation calcium valve . Untreated fatal . Reduced opening area valve increase afterload leave ventricle ( LV ) , lead raise end-diastolic pressure LV . Increased wall stress lead LV hypertrophy expansion extracellular matrix . An abnormally high extracellular volume fraction call myocardial fibrosis ( MF ) , cause increased LV stiffness , diastolic dysfunction , dilatation leave atrium end heart failure . The standard treatment aortic stenosis operation , aortic valve repair ( AVR ) , mechanical biological valve replaces old one . The operation involve substantial risk postoperative mortality , therefore delayed patient develop symptom shortness breath , chest pain syncope . For patient AVR cause significant symptom reduction reduce mortality . Recent study indicate patient severe MF , may account one third patient treat , little symptom improvement increase mortality AVR . This raise concern LV severely fibrotic beyond repair . These patient may benefit operation , possibly AVR perform early stage disease . Today , cardiac fibrosis detect biopsy invasive . Late Gadolinium T1-mapping cardiac Magnetic Resonance imaging ( MRi ) recently evaluate new method detect MF , method costly contraindicate patient . Cardiac Computerized Tomography ( CT ) propose method evaluate MF , properly validate yet . In study compare different method ( biopsy , MRi , CT , echocardiography different biomarkers ) evaluate extent MF 130 patient severe aortic stenosis undergo AVR . We focus symptom improvement survival rate one year operation . Our main thesis patient severe fibrosis operation little symptom improvement reduce survival operation . If thesis correct , question patient offer AVR . Some patient operate today may benefit operation leave ventricle damage severe fibrosis , patient withhold operation today asymptomatic may benefit AVR develop severe fibrosis .</detailed_description>
