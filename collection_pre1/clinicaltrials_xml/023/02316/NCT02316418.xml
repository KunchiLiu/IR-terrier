	<brief_title>Hairstetics™ Anchoring System Female Pattern Hair Loss ( HAS-FPHL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Type trial : Open label - Study population : Female patient androgenetic alopecia ( FPHL ) - Phase : II - Number study arm : Single-arm - Number center : Single center - Name study agent : Hairstetics™ hair anchor system - Changes schedule : maximal number implant may modify throughout trial . ENDPOINTS Primary Endpoint : Percent subject least 70 % hair extension remain place 6-month follow-up visit . Secondary Endpoints : - Proportion hair extension remain place different visit . - Subject aesthetic satisfaction base satisfaction questionnaire ( scale 1-10 ) . - Investigator aesthetic satisfaction base satisfaction questionnaire scale 1-10 ) . - Pain rating procedure , base visual analogue numeric pain rating scale ( scale 0-10 ) . Exploratory Endpoints : - Ease use , base user questionnaire response ( scale 1-10 ) . - Implant retrieval rate . Safety Endpoints : Adverse event expect unexpected , relate unrelated study device procedure , grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) Version 4.03 . STUDY PROCEDURE - After sign informed consent , patient screen study eligibility assessment inclusion exclusion criterion . Screening procedure include collection demographic data , medical history , physical examination , vital sign , laboratory evaluation . Unless patient 's participation trial terminate , subject implant Hairstetics™ anchor system cartridge hold total 360 Hairstetics™ prosthetic hair unit . Complete blood count ( CBC ) , biochemistry coagulation panel quantitative β-HCG , specify eligibility criterion , require treatment test requirement specify inclusion criterion must meet . Patients follow week study implantation procedure , ensure proper monitoring safety event . Hair extension attach four week implantation . Patients follow 3 6 month attachment hair extension . This protocol allow excision implant . This protocol provide arrangement long-term follow-up study participant beyond primary endpoint . SUBJECT POPULATION - Female patient androgenetic alopecia ( female pattern hair loss ; ( FPHL ) ) STUDY DURATION - 13 month . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS - General - No separate Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP ) document plan . Nevertheless , study , modification statistical consideration deem necessary , SAP may issue . The study plan prospective , single-arm study ass safety preliminary efficacy data treatment female subject affect androgenetic alopecia ( FPHL ) Hairstetics™ anchor system . The analysis endpoint descriptive nature ; formal statistical hypothesis test . Primary Endpoint : The number proportion subject least 70 % hair extension remain place 6-month follow-up visit , present . Secondary Endpoints : The proportion hair extension remain place different visit present tabular form . The aesthetic satisfaction assess subject investigator present tabular form visit , continuous variable , categorical variable . The pain procedure present tabular form , continuous variable , categorical variable . Exploratory analysis : The ease use present manner pain . The number proportion subject implant remove presented tabular form . Safety endpoint : The cumulative incidence ( 95 % CI ) adverse event observe procedure throughout follow-up period , present tabular format . A detailed list adverse event present . The adverse event rate compile respect seriousness , severity , relationship procedure device . In addition , listing safety measure produce . Baseline descriptive statistic : Demographic , medical clinical history variable tabulate . Continuous variable summarize mean , standard deviation , minimum , median maximum , categorical variable count percentage . Interim analysis : No interim analysis plan efficacy and/or safety review . Sample size : No formal sample size calculation perform . A sample size ten subject provide safety performance preliminary assessment .</detailed_description>
