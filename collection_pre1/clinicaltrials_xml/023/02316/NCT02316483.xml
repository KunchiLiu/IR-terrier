	<brief_title>Genetic Contribution Pathophysiology Charcot Foot Qatari Patients With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes serious health issue Qatari population since approximately 1/5 population Type 2 Diabetes , 2-3 time higher world average . Although much clinical study diabetes often focused microvascular phenotype retinopathy nephropathy , macrovascular disease present clinically myocardial infarction , stroke , peripheral vascular disease , rare complication Charcot foot disease confer significant burden Qatar diabetic population , lead decreased life quality . Charcot foot estimate affect 0.8 % 8 % diabetic population . It occur commonly patient diabetes complicate severe peripheral neuropathy , often coexist sympathetic denervation , cause increase blood flow foot increase bone resorption . Uncontrolled inappropriate inflammation lead bone resorption deformation hallmark diabetic Charcot foot pathophysiology . There two major theory provide likely mechanism disease . The `` neurovascular ( French ) theory '' suggests increase blood flow , result autonomic neuropathy , lead bone destruction mechanical debilitation . On hand , `` neurotraumatic ( German ) theory '' argue loss protective sensation lead unperceived injury trauma insensate foot . One argue pathogenesis Charcot neuro-arthropathy likely combination process . For unknown reason , Charcot foot trigged susceptible individual diabetes .</detailed_description>
