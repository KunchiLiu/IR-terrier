	<brief_summary>Stress ulcer stress-related mucosal disease ( SRMD ) define `` acute superficial inflammation lesion gastric mucosa induce individual subject abnormally elevate physiologic demand . `` [ 1 ] Studies show SRMD occur 75 % -100 % ICU patient [ 1 ] . Gastrointestinal bleeding due SRMD important complication critically ill patient . The frequency clinically important bleed range 5.3 % 33 % . [ 2 ] The mortality ICU patient stress related bleeding approach 50 % , much high patient without bleed ( 9 % ) . [ 3 ] In 1999 , American Society Health-System Pharmacists ( ASHP ) publish guideline use stress ulcer prophylaxis medical , surgical , respiratory , pediatric ICU patient [ 2 ] . PPIs H2RA widely use China current clinical practice prevention stress ulcer bleed . However , epidemiology data show risk factor stress ulcer bleed bleed rate Chinese neurosurgical critically ill patient usually suffer brain trauma , cerebral haemorrhage brain tumour operation . Information need know characteristic Chinese critically ill neurosurgical patient . Objectives Non-Interventional Study Primary 1 . Primary objective : To estimate overall incidence upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleed critically ill neurosurgical patient China . 2 . Main secondary objective - To estimate incidence upper GI bleed clinically significant complication critically ill neurosurgical patient China . - To estimate incidence overt upper GI bleeding without clinically significant complication critically ill neurosurgical patient China . - To assess time upper GI bleed cerebral lesion . - To investigate potential risk factor associate upper GI bleeding , assess common certain risk factor occur upper GI bleeding patient . - To assess overall incidence upper GI bleed critically ill patient different risk factor upper GI bleeding . - To investigate drug , route administration , dose duration commonly use stress ulcer prophylaxis . - To investigate proportion ICU patient nasogastric tube , duration nasogastric tube . ( ICU : Intensive care unit PPIs : Proton pump inhibitor H2RA : H2 receptor antagonist )</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject population include NIS consecutive discharge patient ≥18 year old hospitalize Neurosurgical department . Those whose Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) ≤10 [ 4 ] within 24 hour lesion/admission define critically ill patient . Three kind case include : brain trauma critically ill patient , cerebral haemorrhage critically ill patient postoperative brain tumour critically ill patient . If participate clinical trial , subject take part study . Subjects ineligible condition : 1 . Those likely swallow blood ( example , severe facial trauma epistaxis ; 2 . Patients previous total gastrectomy ; 3 . Known upper GI lesion might bleed ( e.g. , varix , polyp , tumour , etc ) ; 4 . Evidence active GI bleeding include oesophageal gastric variceal bleeding , Peptic Ulcer Disease ( PUD )</criteria>
