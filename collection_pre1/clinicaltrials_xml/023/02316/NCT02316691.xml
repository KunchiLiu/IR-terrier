	<brief_summary>Thyroid eye disease ( TED ) autoimmune inflammation orbital tissue develop 50 % patient Graves ' disease . Although 80 % respond IVGC initially , relapse rate high 75 % require surgery despite initial response . Although natural history TED associate spontaneous remission 1 3 year , many irreversible serious ophthalmic orbital complication arise time . Therefore , need improve intervention strategy early active inflammatory phase TED , avoid progression cicatricial stage disease manifestation address rehabilitative fashion . The primary immunopathogenesis Graves ' disease consider activation B cell produce autoantibody thyrotropin receptor thyroid ( TRAb ) . Like many autoimmune disease , inflammatory CD4+ T cell subset know Th17 cell also increase blood patient active Graves ' disease ; putative Th17 cytokine , IL-17 , also increase serum tear TED patient . There also emerge pathogenic role Th17 cell co-express chemokine receptor CXCR5 drive autoantibody production . The contribution Th17 cell TED well define . This study observational , longitudinal , prospective study patient receive treatment thyroid eye disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All enrolled subject receive Intravenous Glucocorticoid ( IVGC ) therapy , currently standard care TED patient . Subjects receive IVGC therapy facility choose physician . If disease respond IVGC therapy , receive rituximab and/or surgical decompression and/or radiation also currently standard care facility choose physician . Prior initiation treatment course treatment , study patient get research lab do along routine lab fill questionnaires regard disease symptom . We obtain 30 mL 2 tablespoon blood subject initial evaluation approximately Wk4 , Wk 12 , Wk 26 , Wk 38 , Wk 52 ( may vary depend patient come follow visit , schedule approximates typical standard care patient ) mechanistic study .</detailed_description>
