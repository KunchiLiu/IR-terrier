	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate standardize nutritional intervention protein energy enrich milk could help overcome catabolic state child hospitalize bronchiolitis thus create well nutritional state hospitalization outpatient follow-up . The investigator also want assess clinical repercussion number hospitalization day , duration oxygen support quality life ouptatient follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protein-energy Enriched Milk Infants With Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , investigator aim assess effect protein-energy enrich milk reverse catabolic state ( weight loss , change mid-upper arm circumference tricpes skin fold ) short term failure thrive ( degree weight recovery , change arm circumference ) one week discharge infant moderate severe bronchiolitis . The secondary short term aim investigate effect length hospital stay , day oxygen support rate antibiotic use . Secondary long term outcomes re-admission rate , persistence wheeze number work day miss parent . The investigator hypothesize child receive protein-energy enriched milk hospitalization catabolic state reverse quickly intervention need less hospitalisation day , less oxygen support , less antibiotic use , less re-admission rate , le persistent wheezing less work day miss parent . The investigator also hypothesize effect nutritional intervention propose outcome parameter great child screen high nutritional risk .</detailed_description>
