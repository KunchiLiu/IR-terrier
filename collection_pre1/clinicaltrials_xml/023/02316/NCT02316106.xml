	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate 3 Dose Schedules Daratumumab Participants With Smoldering Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label ( identity assign treatment know participant study staff ) , 3-arm ( 3 treatment group ) , multicenter study daratumumab participant diagnosed intermediate high-risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma ( SMM [ ie , early disease without symptom ] ) . Participants randomize ( assigned chance ) one 3 treatment group receive daratumumab . Each treatment group investigate 1 3 dosing schedule daratumumab . The study include 28-Day Screening Phase , Treatment Phase 1 20 treatment cycle ( cycle 8 week duration total period 8 160 week ) , Follow Phase 4-weeks last dose study drug . The Follow-up Phase continue death , lose follow , consent withdrawal , study end , whichever occur first . The end study occur approximately 4 year last participant enrol receives first dose study drug . Disease assessment perform every 8 week first year every 16 week disease progression . Safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
