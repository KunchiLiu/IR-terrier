	<brief_summary>The NIR light source device base light-emitting diode ( LEDs ) , deliver sufficient light biological tissue induce fluorescence emission meet need plan clinical study . It note light source still well US FDA recommend limit NIR exposure ANSI standard . In addition , light source laser-based , significantly safe optical imaging system utilize laser technology . The fluorescence signal receive detector portion device . Gain-settings could easily adjust operation optimize contrast high fluorescence area ( tumor ) low fluorescence area ( normal tissue ) . Real-time fluorescence video display goggle eyepiece well secondary monitor facilitate viewing surgeon room .</brief_summary>
