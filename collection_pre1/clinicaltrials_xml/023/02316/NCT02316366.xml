	<brief_title>The Use Warmed Saline Vaso-occlusive Episodes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaso-occlusive crisis ( VOC ) common painful complication Sickle Cell Disease primary reason patient seek medical care acute care set . This complication arise blood vessel obstruct sickled red blood cell result ischemic injury . The standard management painful episode comprises administration opioid analgesic , infusion intravenous ( IV ) fluid room temperature rest . These episode often last five seven day many patient require inpatient management continue administration intravenous analgesic . The public health impact disease large admission frequently result school work absence financially emotionally tax . It well establish exposure cold precipitate VOC . For reason , management pain VOC center include use warm blanket adjunct pain relief . It conceptually appeal conjecture warm fluid might similar salutary effect VOC . This conjecture bolster physiologic effect temperature vascular tone . Specifically , well establish cold temperature cause vasoconstriction whereas warm temperature cause vasodilation . We expect warmed fluid similarly induce vasodilation , improve blood flow vaso-occluded ischemic area .</detailed_description>
