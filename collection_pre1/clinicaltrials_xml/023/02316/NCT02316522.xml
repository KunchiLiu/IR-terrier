	<brief_title>Epigenetic Contribution Pathogenesis Diabetic Nephropathy Qatari Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic nephropathy ( DN ) common vascular complication Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) associate increased mortality poor quality life.In industrialized country , DN range first among etiology end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) .Diabetes Qatar serious health issue Qatari population since approximately 1/5 population T2D , 2-3 time higher world average . As observed Gulf cooperation council ( GCC ) country , obesity sedentary lifestyle cornerstone development T2D . Additionally , consanguineous marriage Qatar contribute high prevalence . As consequence , DN enormous burden term management , treatment especially renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) ESRD Qatari Population.DN glomerular disease define increased urinary albumin excretion ( UAE ) , hypertension decline glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , induce chronic hyperglycemia . However , contribute factor genetic predisposition , systemic intra-renal hemodynamic disturbance , lead glomerulosclerosis . All know pathway explain complex pathophysiology behind DN . Even different variant gene describe major GWAS study little impact term risk prevention prognosis DN . Over last decade , epigenetics initiate new era Genetic Medicine capable give different approach human disease .</detailed_description>
