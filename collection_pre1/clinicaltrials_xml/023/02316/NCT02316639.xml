	<brief_summary>Recently , dramatic rise number child participate competitive sport . Adolescents involved sport require cutting , pivot body contact great risk sustain anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) rupture knee , however , appropriate management remain controversial . The surgical technique commonly perform adult population associate risk growth disturbance perform skeletally immature individual . Therefore , recommend standard care child initially follow non-surgical management protocol allow patient skeletally mature prior ultimately receive surgical reconstruction . Unfortunately , current non-surgical management protocol ineffective enhance knee joint stability dynamic function . There research indicate appropriate exercise program ACL deficient skeletally immature individual . A neuromuscular exercise program prove safe effective ACL deficient adult population perturbation training . In adolescent , research suggest neuromuscular exercise reduce rate ACL injuries 50 % . However , currently research investigate benefit neuromuscular exercise management skeletally immature ACL-deficient individual . The result investigation provide researcher clinician valuable information effect neuromuscular perturbation exercise knee joint stability function immediately follow injury . This potential minimize development secondary meniscal tear premature joint degeneration commonly demonstrate follow ACL injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following ethic approval University Manitoba Winnipeg Regional Health Authority , 44 participant recruit study . During intake session , subject complete informed assent consent , participant information knee demographic form . A radiographic report knee confirm subject skeletally immature obtain refer orthopedic surgeon perform Pan Am clinic . For ACL-injured subject , clinical examination diagnosis KT-1000 test confirm injury . Anthropometric data , age , height , weight , range motion , leg circumference pubertal maturation observation scale ( PMOS ) , collect . All subject require pas standardize screening protocol prior continue test procedure . Testing Sessions : Each subject participate 4 follow-up test session initial intake ; Pre-exercise session start study , Follow-up # 1 mid-point study , Follow-up # 2 end study Test-retest session exercise phase study . Within week complete intake session , subject complete pre-exercise test session . All follow-up testing session include : 1 . Subjective evaluation knee function via Pedi-IKDC Physical Activity Questionnaire Children ( PAQ-C ) , 2 . Standardized warm-up stationary bike , 3 . Dynamic balance evaluation use SEBT Y-Balance test , 4 . Strength test use Biodex isokinetic dynamometer core stability test , 5 . Knee laxity test use KT-1000 . Both ACL-injured healthy knee subject randomly divide two group , Group A &amp; B . The week follow baseline test , Group A begin 5-week NMT protocol , complete follow-up # 1 test session , receive intervention 5 week , return follow-up # 2 test session . The week follow baseline test , Group B receive intervention 5 week , complete follow-up # 1 test session , complete 5-week NMT protocol return follow-up # 2 test session . The test-retest session conduct first week `` No Exercise '' phase . Neuromuscular Training ( NMT ) Sessions : The establish Neuromuscular Training ( NMT ) protocol supervise , progressive program patient maintain balance three different support surface clinician administers purposeful manipulation support system.1 The patient maintain single-leg stance rollerboard tiltboard surface , two-leg stance one foot roller board platform . Participants complete two training session per week , five week total 10 training session . During session , legs receive train 2-3 set 1 minute duration support surface . Subjects complete training session Certified Athletic Therapist Physiotherapist Pan Am clinic .</detailed_description>
