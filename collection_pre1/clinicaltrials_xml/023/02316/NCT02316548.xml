	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study side effect well postoperative intensity modulate radiotherapy work surgery treat patient urothelial bladder cancer . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell leave behind pelvis surgery . It yet know whether surgery follow radiotherapy effective surgery alone treat patient urothelial bladder cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery With Without Postoperative Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Urothelial Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To evaluate ability postcystectomy adjuvant radiotherapy safely reduce pelvic tumor recurrence , define pelvic recurrence-free survival . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate increase disease-free survival . II . Evaluate toxicity adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Patients stratify neoadjuvant preoperative postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy . ARM I : No radiotherapy . ARM II : Patients undergo radiotherapy ( IMRT ) 1.8 Gy , 5 day week 6 week total 28 treatment 50.4 Gy , absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . IMRT start within 14 day registration postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy , otherwise within 14 day completion chemotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Initial histological diagnosis muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma within 180 day prior registration Patients must undergo radical cystectomy ileal conduit urothelial bladder carcinoma within 49 day prior registration ; final cystectomy pathology must either pure urothelial carcinoma dominant urothelial carcinoma admixture histology exclude small cell variant Neoadjuvant ( preoperative ) adjuvant ( postoperative ) chemotherapy bladder cancer permit ; however , patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy must register within 49 day complete cystectomy regardless whether adjuvant chemotherapy start . Patients receive adjuvant ( postoperative ) chemotherapy randomize within 21 day complete chemotherapy Patients follow TNM stage eligible : pT3apN0 ; pN1 ; pN2 provide less 10 node dissect and/or positive surgical margin pT3bpN0 ; pN1 ; pN2 pT4apN0 ; pN1 ; pN2 pT4bpN0 ; pN1 ; pN2 Appropriate stage study entry base follow diagnostic workup : History/physical examination = &lt; 45 day prior registration ; Computed tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) CT include chest , abdomen pelvis perform initial radiological staging . This may perform pre postsurgery = &lt; 90 day prior registration except patient get postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy , require CT , MRI PETCT include chest abdomen pelvis 30 day prior registration ; image perform postoperatively show evidence residual disease Age &gt; =18 Zubrod performance status 02 = &lt; 45 day prior registration Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1,500 cells/mm^3 Platelets &gt; = 100,000 cells/mm^3 Hemoglobin &gt; = 8.0 g/dl ( NOTE : use transfusion intervention achieve hemoglobin [ Hgb ] &gt; = 8.0 g/dl acceptable ) The patient must provide studyspecific inform consent prior study entry Definitive clinical radiologic evidence metastatic disease ; pN3 disease allow Any type orthotopic neobladder creation ( new bladder place location old bladder ) Prior invasive solid tumor hematological malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer incidentally discover prostate cancer time cystoprostatectomy ) unless disease free minimum 3 year Prior chemotherapy malignancy ; neoadjuvant precystectomy chemotherapy permit Prior radiotherapy pelvis Patients history inflammatory bowel disease Patients require treatment ( medical surgical ) bowel obstruction prior diagnosis bladder cancer require surgical treatment bowel obstruction cystectomy Severe , active comorbidity define follow : Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within last 6 month Transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration Severe hepatic disease , define diagnosis ChildPugh class B C hepatic disease Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4 count &lt; 200 cells/microliter . Note patient HIV positive eligible , provide treatment highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) CD4 count &gt; = 200 cells/microliter within 30 day prior registration . Note also HIV test require eligibility protocol Other major medical illness require hospitalization precludes study therapy time registration Women breast feeding</criteria>
