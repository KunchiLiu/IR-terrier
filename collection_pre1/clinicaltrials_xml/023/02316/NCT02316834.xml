	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn effect BMN 673 ovarian , Fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer . Researchers want find certain characteristic DNA ( genetic material cell ) affect disease respond therapy BMN 673 treatment BMN 673 affect genetic material cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>POSITION : A PilOt Study InducTion PARP InhibitiON Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If participant eligible continue study , begin take BMN 673 tablet mouth every day , start day schedule laparoscopy . Participant take study drug least 7 day schedule tumor reduction surgery . Participant stop take drug day surgery recovery time . Once participant recover surgery ( 3-6 week later ) , receive standard chemotherapy treatment . The chemotherapy part participant 's standard care treatment part research study . The type chemotherapy participant receive doctor . The tablet take either 2 hour 2 hour meal . If participant vomit take daily dose BMN 673 , retake dose . Participant wait next schedule dose , next day . Participant need record take dose study drug diary . The study drug diary provide study staff , show participant fill . Study Visits : On day participant 's screening visit , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test part standard clinical care . Part sample also use genetic research test describe . On day participant 's laparoscopy , follow procedure perform study : - At least 4 fresh sample tumor tissue ( 1 x 1 cm tissue section ) collect research purpose laparoscopic exam . Tissue may collect ovary ( 2 sample ) , peritoneum , omentum , diaphragm , site . All sample store MD Anderson Gynecologic Oncology Tumor Bank . Participant 's sample store unique identifier know authorized member study team . The assigned unique identifier ensure protection participant 's private health information . Samples store MD Anderson Gynecologic Oncology Tumor Bank indefinitely . On day participant 's pre-operative visit , routine test . Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test part participant 's standard clinical care . Part sample also use genetic research test describe . On day participant 's surgery , follow procedure perform study : - At least 4 fresh sample tumor tissue ( 1 x 1 cm tissue section ) collect research purpose laparoscopic exam . Tissue may collect ovary ( 2 sample ) , peritoneum , omentum , diaphragm , site . All sample store MD Anderson Gynecologic Oncology Tumor Bank . Participant 's sample store unique identifier know authorized member study team . The assigned unique identifier ensure protection participant 's private health information . Samples store MD Anderson Gynecologic Oncology Tumor Bank indefinitely . On day participant 's post-operative visit , routine test perform part standard clinical care . Length Treatment : Participant may take study drug 28 day , long doctor think best interest . Participant longer able take study drug intolerable side effect occur , eligible treatment/surgery , unable follow study direction . Patient 's participation study follow-up visit . Follow-Up : Participant may ask come clinic follow-up visit 30 day tumor reduction surgery . At visit , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test part participant 's standard clinical care . Part sample also use genetic research test describe . Participant 's health status follow information collect routine clinic visit every 3 month stop study drug . If participant stop take BMN 673 side effect , study staff follow side effect go away . This investigational study . BMN 673 FDA approve . At time , use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 30 participant take part research study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Patients presumed advancedstage high grade serous ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma , base presence carcinomatosis , and/or elevate CA125 , and/or ovarian mass ( e ) , discretion treat physician . 2 . Medically able undergo primary cytoreductive surgery , least 7 day 28 day start study drug , determine treat physician . 3 . No prior therapy highgrade serous ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma . 4 . Patients must able swallow tolerate oral medication gastrointestinal illness would preclude absorption BMN 673 ( e.g . uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea ; malabsorption syndrome ; ulcerative disease ) 5 . Patients must normal organ marrow function ( measure within 28 day prior entry/ randomization ) define : . Absolute neutrophil count &gt; /= 1,500/mcL b. Hemoglobin &gt; /= 9gm/dL c. Platelets &gt; /= 100,000/mcL d. Total Bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5X ULN e. AST/ALT &lt; /= 2.5x upper limit normal unless liver involved tumor , case , ALT/AST must &lt; /= 5x upper limit normal f. Creatinine clearance &gt; /= 50 mL/min ( assessed Cockcroft Gault estimation ) 6 . Patients must ECOG performance status 0 1 7 . The effect BMN 673 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential partner must agree use contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) time study entry 30 day last dose study medication . Women childbearing potential ( intact uterus ) negative serum pregnancy test . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 8 . Cont . form # 7 . Female patient must evidence nonchildbearing potential fulfil one follow criterion screen : － Postmenopausal define age 50 year amenorrheic least 12 consecutive month follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment － Documentation irreversible surgical sterilization hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy bilateral salpingectomy , tubal ligation . Male partner instruct use contraception study period . 9 . It unknown BMN 673 express human breast milk . For reason , woman must breastfeed take study medication . 10 . Patients must able understand willing sign inform consent . 11 . Patients must least 18 year age . 1 . Prior treatment ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . 2 . Receipt investigational agent additional anticancer agent . 3 . Significant symptom burden presume diagnosis include large volume ascites , pain require narcotic medication , shortness breath exertion . 4 . Myocardial infarction within 6 month start therapy , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association &gt; class II ) , unstable angina , unstable cardiac arrhythmia require medication . 5 . As judged Investigator , evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g. , severe hepatic impairment , interstitial lung disease [ bilateral , diffuse , parenchymal lung disease ] , uncontrolled chronic renal disease [ glomerulonephritis , nephritic syndrome , Fanconi Syndrome Renal tubular acidosis ] ) , current unstable uncompensated respiratory cardiac condition , uncontrolled hypertension ( blood pressure &gt; /= 140/90 ) , active bleeding diatheses active infection include hepatitis B , hepatitis C , human immunodeficiency virus . Screening chronic condition require . 6 . As judged Investigator , patient unsuitable participate study patient unlikely comply study procedure , restriction , requirement .</criteria>
