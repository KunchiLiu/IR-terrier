	<brief_summary>Subjects ask participate study arm leg amputation develop pain related neuroma ( ongoing localize pain related cut nerve end ) . The investigator study target reinnervation ( TR ) help treat neuroma pain increase prosthetic control . This surgery connect cut nerve ending nerve go nearby nonfunctional muscle . This surgery develop allow amputee good prosthesis control . By chance , neuroma pain improve significantly TR . The investigator , therefore , conduct clinical trial . The investigator ask participant fill questionnaire surgery . This help u understand neuroma affect quality life amputee allow u understand best improve neuroma pain prosthesis control . In order confirm presence location neuroma surgery , magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) perform . Taking picture require subject lie still short period time involve invasive procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted Reinnervation Neuromas Means Improve Prosthesis Control Major Limb Amputation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Loss arm leg significant injury affect person 's job prospect , personal relationship , overall quality life . Approximately 25 % amputee develop chronic local pain remain part amputate limb . This pain cause neuromas- disorganized nerve ending scar tissue form injure nerve try heal . Every cut nerve develop neuroma unless two end nerve rejoin . With limb amputation , nerve cut one end lose limb , prevent nerve repair . Instead , cut nerve end form painful neuroma . Chronic pain neuromas major reason amputee wear use prosthesis comfortably increase disability . Even limb amputate , nerve use control limb still carry message brain . Those message intend tell muscle move miss limb , amputation , limb-control nerve longer connect muscle . In 2002 , researcher Northwestern Memorial Hospital conjunction Rehabilitation Institute Chicago develop new type surgery call target muscle reinnervation ( TMR ) . In TMR , limb-control nerve transfer control new target muscle . The neuromas limb-control nerve remove , small nerve control target muscle cut . The two nerve join together limb-control nerve grow , reinnervate target muscle . After TMR , person try move miss limb , target muscle contract instead signal detect use control prosthesis . TMR do successfully almost 100 time worldwide . Interestingly , almost patient painful neuromas TMR neuroma pain surgery . This result investigate laboratory study - rat rabbit amputee neuroma `` cured '' TMR . We think give cut nerve ending somewhere go something prevents neuroma form . We measure effectiveness surgery use internet-based amputee pain questionnaire . We expect TMR effective neuroma pain prosthesis control standard treatment . This change patient neuroma pain treat help thousand patient amputation .</detailed_description>

To perform second TR procedure previously shorten nerve would require significant proximal dissection potentially great soft tissue morbidity standard treatment . Cognitive impairment , due TBI cause , sufficient adversely affect understand compliance study requirement , ability respond questionnaire , ability give inform consent : The ability understand comply requirement study essential order study generate useable , reliable data . The ability obtain relevant feedback questionnaires essential study . Preoperative assessment precludes patient eligible TR control surgery due technical surgical concern .
