	<detailed_description>Pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) health concern million woman worldwide . Patients variety symptom POP include : vaginal bulging , vaginal pressure , constipation urinary incontinence ( 1 ) . It estimate lifetime risk undergo surgery prolapse incontinence 11 % . The lifetime risk recurrence POP surgery 10-20 % ( 2 ) . Treatment option POP include kegel exercise , pessary surgical management . Due lifestyle , time inability undergo surgery secondary medical comorbidities pessary reasonable alternative surgical management POP . There two category pessary : support space occupy . Support pessaries usually recommend early stage prolapse adequate perineal support include ring pessary , Gehrung , Hodge Shaatz . While space-occupying pessary Donut , Gellhorn , Cube Inflataball use advanced stage prolapse less perineal support wide genital hiatus ( 3 ) . As ring Gellhorn pessary commonly used pessary insert stage prolapse , study focus use ring support Gellhorn treatment POP ( 4 ) . After menopause , estrogen level decline . This may allow postmenopausal vaginal pH increase range 5.0-7.5 . At high pH level , lactobacillus survival hinder , vaginal colonization bacterial specie predispose woman symptomatic vaginitis ( 5 ) . Discontinuation pessary use often due discomfort , expulsion , urinary retention bothersome vaginal discharge vaginal erosion ( 6 ) . Common complication pessary use erosion ( 8.9 % ) , vaginal infection ( 2.5 % ) ( 7 ) . Some study show erosion rate high 21 % ( 6 ) . Patients often complain vaginal discharge pessary use malodorous bothersome . Local estrogen help restore vaginal pH help reduce vaginal discharge . The moisturizing property vaginal lubricant cream may help reduce vaginal erosion pessary user . We would like compare Estrace ® placebo . The placebo hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) base cream Estrace ® without estradiol . No randomized control trial ( RCT ) perform show application local hormone ( Estrace ) superior application local nonhormonal vaginal cream reduction bothersome symptom vaginal discharge subsequently erosion . We would like compare vaginal estrogen placebo mechanism prevent bothersome discharge prevention vaginal erosion woman fit pessary pelvic organ prolapse . Study Population In general , study population patient Urogynecology practice North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System present clinic initial pessary fitting . Patients fit either ring support Gellhorn pessary return interval 2 , 6 12 week follow . All subject 18 yr age screen eligibility relative patient inclusion exclusion criterion . If patient eligible enroll study , nature purpose study explain subject witness present . The subject review sign write Informed Consent Form indicating inform voluntary participation study . A copy consent form include risk benefit research subject attach separate document . Recruitment study do via direct contact patient population . If subject find eligible participate , approve study investigator approach schedule initial pessary visit . No form advertisement use . The recruitment method use provide equitable selection subject . After determination eligibility base inclusion/exclusion criterion patient consent study related procedure . The subject must consent participate sign specific Institutional Review Board approve Informed Consent Form prior conduct study specific procedure . Patient may consent clinic department urogynecology . New patient present initial pessary fitting appropriate size ring support Gellhorn pessary place per standard care . The patient return 2 week follow visit per standard care . If change pessary indicate patient approach participation study . If agrees participate , randomize use estrogen cream ( Estrace ) placebo stratify type pessary . Estrace contain 0.1 mg estradiol per gram cream . The recommended dosing 2-4 gram daily 1-2 week gradual reduction half initial dose 1-2 week , 1 gram 1-3 time weekly maintenance . Participants provide medication prepackaged 0.5cc syringe . Either digitally use syringe , place 1cm distal introitus . This technique review participant also demonstrate correct application . She use cream nightly 1 week reduce dose 2 time weekly maintenance . Participants use cream nightly 1 week twice weekly night . The patient give 3 month supply vaginal cream randomize . We preload syringe 0.5cc either estrace placebo cream . These randomize non-blinded study personnel . Study participant return follow-up appointment 2 week , 6 week , 12 week 6 month . Participants also expect return syrinx use prior schedule visit . This aid assessment patient compliance suggest use medication also ensure correct disposal vaginal cream . As per standard care , vaginal culture obtain visit patient complain bothersome , malodorous discharge . In addition vaginal culture , patient report malodorous discharge undergo saline irrigation time visit examination vaginal tissue erosion . If vaginal erosion present pessary replace patient instruct continue previously prescribe regimen 3 time weekly application vaginal cream . If vaginal erosion note , pessary leave 3 week patient instruct use vaginal cream daily 3 week . The patient return office 3 week vaginal exam replacement pessary upon resolution vaginal erosion . We assess atrophy , erosion , vaginal discharge obtain vaginal culture clinically applicable . Questionnaires complete baseline , 12 week 6 month follow-up visit include : Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory ( PFDI ) , Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire ( PFIQ ) . We assess patient satisfaction use pessary follow-up use Liekhart scale . Patients bothersome vaginal discharge use VAS scale rating 10cm linear continuum 0 represent bothersome 10 represent bothersome . Vaginal erosion clinically describe minimal , moderate severe . This research may benefit study participant directly . However , knowledge gain study may help physicians patient future regard best treatment reduce vaginal discharge vaginal erosion pessary user . Potential risk study outside risk associate pessary use minimal . Complications pessary use include : vaginal erosion , urinary retention , urinary incontinence discomfort . These complication review patient prior insertion pessary . Potential risk encounter use vaginal estrogen low . Estrace contain 0.1 mg estradiol per gram cream . The recommended dosing 2-4 g daily 1-2 week , gradual reduction half initial dose 1-2 week , 1 g 1-3 time weekly maintenance . Our patient use half recommend daily dose maintenance , 1/4th recommend dose prim atrophic tissue . We also reduce additional minimal risk associate local vaginal estrogen exclusion criterion . If participant report use cream return syrinx unused , remove study lack compliance . Study participant also remove study develop new diagnosis condition list exclusion criterion . Finally , remove allergic reactions/adverse event occur use Estrace placebo . There replacement procedure study participant withdraw . No action follow warrant study participant removal . This double-blinded randomized control trial subject pelvic organ prolapse , counsel initial visit , opt treatment vaginal pessary . Patients Gellhorn Ring support pessary place randomized one two arm application local vaginal cream : estrogen placebo . The object study compare incidence vaginal discharge vaginal erosion study arm . We also compare subjective measure include quality life satisfaction treatment plan . Our Primary Objective compare use Estrace® placebo reduce symptomatic vaginal discharge vaginal erosion patient use Gellhorn Ring pessary . Prior randomization subject stratify accord type pessary ( Gellhorn Ring ) . Within stratum , subject randomly assign 1:1 ratio Estrace® placebo . The Biostatistics Unit develop computer-generated randomization list utilizes permute block design , develop implement well document double-blind randomization procedure . Intention-to-treat ( ITT ) : Data collect analyzed accord ITT principle . The ITT population patient randomize , regardless whether study cream apply . All patient analyze group randomize ( even switch another cream . ) Patients assess study data baseline ( pessary place successfully , week 0 ) , 6 , 12 , 24 week . Descriptive statistic ( mean ± standard deviation median interquartile range [ 25th percentile , 75th percentile ] continuous data ; frequency percentages categorical data ) calculate subject demographic clinical characteristic well outcomes observed end trial . The two group compare categorical variable use chi-square test Fisher 's exact test , deem appropriate . The two-sample t-test Mann-Whitney test use compare two group continuous data . Separate repeat measure analysis variance ( RMANOVA ) model use mixed model approach use compare two treatment arm respect vaginal discharge , POP-Q staging , PFDI , PFIQ trajectories baseline 24 week . Each model include main effect treatment arm ( Estrace® placebo ) time ( 0 , 12 , 24 week ) , well treatment x time interaction . If interaction group time find statistically significant , main effect treatment group time analyze . For analysis , standard assumption Gaussian residual quality variance test . If standard assumption meet , transformation perform . A result consider statistically significant p &lt; 0.05 level significance . All analysis perform use SAS version 9.3 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . The propose sample size double-blind randomize control trial n=246 subject ( n=123 per arm ) . Based data publish Manchana , 21 % symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse patient fit successfully pessary vaginal erosion . Let u assume 60 % reduction estimate ( 21 % 8.4 % ) use Estrace® . A two group χ2 test 0.05 two-sided significance level 80 % power detect difference vaginal erosion rate placebo group = 0.21 vaginal erosion rate Estrace® group = 0.084 sample size group 123 . Our study limitation primary outcome subjective assessment vaginal discharge vaginal erosion . Our population older , postmenopausal population therefore may susceptible vaginal erosion . Patient compliance use vaginal cream 2 time weekly also another limitation patient direct control , however try reduce limitation require patient bring use syrinx back office . The PI monitor data , emphasis data integrity patient welfare concern include : recommendation concern continuation conclusion study , protection confidentiality trial data result monitoring , review data study quality .
