	<brief_summary>The study aim evaluate effect fluconazole pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile single oromucosal dose Sativex® ( i.e . body absorbs , distribute , metabolise excretes drug ) healthy subject history cannabis use . The primary clinical hypothesis drug-drug interaction Sativex® fluconazole detect effect PK parameter Sativex® , administer healthy human volunteer experience use cannabis . The study additionally aim evaluate safety tolerability oromucosal dose Sativex® subject give concurrently fluconazole .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Study Evaluate Effects Fluconazole Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Sativex® Healthy Subjects With Cannabis Experience .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label , randomize , single-dose , two-sequence , two-treatment , four-period , crossover study evaluate effect fluconazole PK Sativex® healthy subject cannabis experience . Subjects randomly assign one two treatment sequence . Each sequence four Inpatient Periods . During Inpatient Period , subject either receive single dose Sativex® alone ( Treatment A ) single-dose Sativex® coadministered interaction drug , fluconazole ( Treatment B ) . The crossover treatment separate washout period least 10 day , 12 day , Sativex® dose . Specifically Treatments A B , single oromucosal dose Sativex® ( 10.8 mg THC 10 mg CBD deliver four spray ) administer fasted state Day 1 within Inpatient Period . During Treatment B , fluconazole 200 mg twice daily ( BID ) two day , administer following time point relative Day 1 Sativex® dose : 1 hour pre-dose , approximately 11 , 24 , 36 hour post-dose . Subjects check clinical research facility Day 1 Inpatient Period . Subjects confine clinical research facility Inpatient Period , remain clinical unit dose observation collection PK blood sample . Fifteen PK blood sample take per subject study period : prior Sativex® dosing ( t=0 ) follow multiple time point dose : 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 hour ; along select sample fluconazole measurement ( Day 1 2 pre-fluconazole morning dose , 4 hour 8 hour post-fluconazole morning dose ) . Subjects discharge unit 48-hour post-dose PK sample sample clinical laboratory test vital sign take subject determined fit discharge . A Safety Follow-Up Visit perform 7 ( +2 ) day last Inpatient period . The expected duration study participation ( include Screening Visit , Inpatient Periods , Safety Follow-up Visit ) individual subject maximum 61 day .</detailed_description>
