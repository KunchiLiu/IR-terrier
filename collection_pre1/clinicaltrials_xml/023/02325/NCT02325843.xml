	<brief_title>Treatment Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Ocular Corneal Burn</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corneal burn ocular damage disease include chemically burn thermally burn . Surgery corneal transplantation，amniotic membrane transplantation effective , however , therapy expensive transplantation resource limit . To arrest inflammatory phase , several type immunosuppressive treatment investigate . Corticosteroids also important , however , long time usage corticosteroid often cause severe side-effects . Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) biological characteristic self -renewal , immune regulation , multidirectional differentiation tissue repair . Our preliminary research show corneal alkali injury rat , MSC accelerate cornea repair , inhibited angiogenesis . Many animal research also reveal MSC effect ocular alkali burn . And subconjunctivity injection efficient , clinical study MSC treat disease develop rapidly recently , , outcome encouraging , side-effect related MSC report , MSC come bone marrow , Umbilical cord blood，Adipose tissue , bone marrow MSC mostly common use . The investigator propose assess efficacy safety human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell treatment corneal burn human .</detailed_description>
