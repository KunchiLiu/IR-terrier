	<detailed_description>Coronary arterial disease ( CAD ) define obstruction blood flow coronary artery ( i.e . artery supply blood heart muscle ) . Patients symptoms coronary artery disease usually suffer stable angina pectoris ( chest pain discomfort ) , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) . The symptom range mild angina , moderate severe angina . In case CAD blood vessel chronically totally block ( total occlusion ) , stop blood flow block blood vessel . In case minimally invasive treatment surgery may need . `` Minimally invasive procedure '' consist angioplasty stent placement . The procedure perform local anesthetic patient lie back . Angioplasty routine , well know , non-surgical procedure perform make small incision skin groin catheter ( narrow tube ) guidewire ( thin metal wire ) insert reach block artery . After reach block artery crossing blockage guidewire , tiny balloon inflate inside artery open blockage . During course procedure small piece material cause blockage may break carried blood stream part body may lodge cause damage block blood flow . The Bell Balloon Catheter design help physician capture material may break .</detailed_description>
