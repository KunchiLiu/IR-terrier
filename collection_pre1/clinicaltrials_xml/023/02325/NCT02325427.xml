	<brief_summary>This study investigate change brain activity acute stroke patient , correlate finding clinical outcome measure . Another aim study investigate whether transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) could improve motor function subject poor brain activity stroke . The brain activity measure single paired pulse TMS ( transcranial magnetic stimulation ) . The study hypothesize : 1 . The neural mechanism employ patient different response TMS stimulation different . It hypothesize patient response upon TMS stimulation might poorer motor function outcome , compare patient response upon TMS stimulation . 2 . The result clinical outcome measure relate TMS measurement . 3. tDCS intervention beneficial subject poor brain activity . Clinical outcome measure include battery upper limb motor test upper extremity component Fugl-Meyer Assessment , Modified Ashworth scale spasticity , box block test , manual muscle test . Clinical outcome TMS measurement assess within 2 week , 4-6 week 6 month post-stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TMS measurement clinical outcome measurement perform 119 stroke subject upper limb impairment FMA score 0-45 within 1 month stroke , 6-8 week post-stroke , 6 month post-stroke . It important know cortical excitability well clinical outcome measurement time point , different stage stroke include acute phase , enable u know interaction brain activity functional outcome . In addition , study show TMS ( Pennisi et al , 1999 ) clinical outcome measurement ( FMA ) ( De Weerdt Harrison 1985 ; Bernspang et al . 1987 ; Feys et al . 2000 ) measurable acute phase stroke . Subjects recruit exist patient study physician 's cohort patient referral attend physician . During initial screen visit , FMA administer trained research staff , questionnaire MMSE also administer trained research staff subject 's cognitive assessment . Subjects ' eligibility verify self-report participant well medical record access participate physician . It ascertain subject fulfills criterion participation inform consent obtain study staff . Subjects fully brief detail regard experimental procedure , risk benefit involve responsibility study . Subject continue routine rehabilitation train trial . For patient whose MEP could induce single pulse TMS stimulation , randomly divide 2 group one group receive 1mA tDCS stimulation 20 minute primary motor cortex cortical representation hand , group receive sham stimulation tDCS . A research staff supervise physician apply tDCS subject whose MEP could induce TMS stimulation correspond cortex area . Direct current transfer saline-soaked pair surface sponge electrode ( 35cm2 ) deliver battery-operated , constant current stimulator maximum output 10mA , non-metallic conductor rubber electrode . Stimulation conduct intensity 1 mA last 20 minute . The anode place affected primary motor cortex ( M1 ) cortical representation hand , cathode use reference electrode place forehead unaffected side . The stimulation parameter tDCS treatment employ sham stimulation . However , current apply 30 second , give subject sensation stimulation . Current intensity increase decrease gradually ( 0-1mA ) decrease perception . It postulate recruit 20 subject intervention group . The real sham tDCS intervention conduct daily 10 day first second TMS assessment , i.e. , 2 6 week stroke onset . And real sham tDCS conduct daily traditional rehabilitation training , . A research staff supervise physician apply TMS measurement cortical excitability intracortical inhibition/facilitation subject . Patients seat comfortably instruct remain still . A tight swim cap worn subject . The vertex mark cap . Singe pulse TMS deliver use Magstim Bistim² stimulator via coil figure eight . The coil position maintain manually assistant handle coil point posterior angel 45 degree sagittal plane . Surface electromyography ( EMG ) electrodes attached abductor pollicis brevis muscle ( APB ) EMG record . The `` hot spot '' motor evoke potential ( MEP ) APB first identify mark left right side . This spot use recording side . The low intensity need elicit MEP response least 50µV amplitude elicit 50 % 8 successive trial record rest motor threshold ( RMT ) . For intracortical inhibition/facilitation recording , first subthreshold conditioning stimulus ( 80 % RMT ) apply , follow second suprathreshold stimulus ( 120 % RMT ) variable interstimulus interval ( ISI ) . The following ISIs - 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 15 m use . The percentage change ISI TMS calculate MEPs therefore provide measure change intracortical facilitation inhibition . Both single- paired-pulse paradigm perform affected unaffected hemisphere . Clinical outcome measurement include battery upper limb motor test : Fugl-Meyer Assessment , Modified Ashworth scale spasticity , manual muscle test box block test , perform trained research staff .</detailed_description>
