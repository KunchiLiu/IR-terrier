	<detailed_description>The investigator propose compare effectiveness 3 support strategy optimize sustainable implementation evidence-based ALL intervention . To , investigator randomize 30 community health center ( CHCs ) receive 1 3 implementation support strategy : Low support ( toolkit ) , Medium ( toolkit , staff training ) , High ( toolkit , training , on-site facilitation ) . The study aim follow : Aim 1 : Compare effectiveness 3 strategy ( low , medium , high intensity ) support CHCs ' implementation ALL intervention , cluster-randomized trial . Hypothesis : Clinics randomize receive implementation support likely randomize receive less support ( high &gt; medium &gt; low ) significantly improve percent patient ( ) guideline-appropriate prescription ACE/ARBs statin , ( ii ) last blood pressure ( BP ) low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) control ) . Aim 2 : Assess effectively 3 strategy support intervention sustainability 12 , 24 36 month post-implementation , measure maintenance change time ( outcomes Aim 1 ) . Hypothesis : Clinics randomize receive implementation support likely maintain change outcomes interest . Aim 3 : Identify clinic characteristic associated support strategy ' effectiveness ( e.g . decision-making structure , leadership support , team process / characteristic , readiness capacity change ) . Research question : What characteristic clinic achieve sustain change even less implementation support , achieve change even support ?</detailed_description>
