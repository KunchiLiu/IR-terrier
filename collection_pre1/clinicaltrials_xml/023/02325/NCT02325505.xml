	<brief_title>Characterization Patients With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex , Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Angiomyolipoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ( TSC ) multisystemic autosomal dominant disease , characterize development histologically benign neoplasm brain , kidney , lung , skin , heart eye , well central nervous system ( CNS ) disorganization . TSC cause mutation TSC1 ( Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1 ) and/or TSC2 gene , encode , respectively , hamartin tuberin , proteins form complex involve regulation cell proliferation , cell cycle protein synthesis . Although majority organ susceptible , patient exhibit dermatological , renal , neurological pulmonary manifestation . Involvement CNS respond TSC morbidity include subependymal nodule , subependymal giant cell astrocytomas ( SEGA ) cortical tuber , alteration prone lead ventricular obstruction , hydrocephalus , epilepsy , intellectual disability psychiatric problem . Lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) rare disease characterize proliferation LAM cell around airway , blood vessel lymphatics , result vascular airway obstruction cyst formation . LAM occur sporadically association tuberous sclerosis complex . The main clinical feature dyspnea , pneumothorax chylothorax . The frequent TSC manifestation kidney development angiomyolipomas ( AML ) , tumor derive perivascular epithelioid cell comprise abnormally organize blood vessel , smooth muscle cell adipose tissue . AML affect 60-80 % TSC patient , also occur sporadically . The main AML-related complication renal hemorrhage , common cause mortality adult TSC . Dermatologic lesion represent common manifestation TSC , mainly hypomelanotic macule facial angiofibromas . The significant functional implication tuberin-hamartin complex regulatory role upon mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway . Mutations TSC1 TSC2 lead increase mTOR activity favor tumor development growth . Interestingly , lesion associate TSC , sporadic LAM sporadic AML share common molecular pathogenesis , base TSC1/TSC2 mutation mTOR hyperactivity . A number study show potentially beneficial effect mTOR inhibitor LAM TSC patient SEGA AML , include sirolimus everolimus . Such positive effect , however , heterogeneous among manifestation critical piece information lack define true role mTOR inhibitor TSC manifestation , well sporadic form LAM AML . 2 . Study rational The University São Paulo Medical School main large medical complex Latin America . Up date , TSC patient follow separated medical service institution , accord predominant phenotype . The current knowledge therapeutic perspective , however , suggest moment ideal follow patient conduct integrated fashion among specialty associate main disease manifestation , ie , neurology , pulmonary , nephrology , urology dermatology . Experts TSC area recently come together create TSC/LAM/AML integrated program University São Paulo Medical School , aim building Brazilian TSC Reference Center . This center expect provide integrated clinical follow TSC patient . We also expect bring center reference status entire country . This project initiate generation integrate TSC/LAM/AML registry , include TSC LAM case select AML patient accord potential severity . This database plan fed access physician include current proposal . Such registry intend clinically characterize patient population also document employ treatment modality . Once first goal achieve , strategic well-designed clinical study plan perform , include clinical trial mTOR inhibitor . 3 . Objectives 3.1 . Primary objective The central aim observational study clinically characterize patient TSC , LAM AML follow referred University São Paulo Medical School . 3.2 . Secondary objective - To characterize pulmonary phenotype patient sample , integrate conventional clinical finding radiological pulmonary functional test feature . - To characterize neurological phenotype analyze patient population , compose clinical observation radiological finding surgical post-surgery follow-up . - To characterize renal phenotype evaluate patient population integrate clinical finding radiologic alteration surgical post-surgery follow-up . - To characterize dermatologic phenotype patient population . - To establish data loss productivity hospitalization study analyzed patient population . 4 . Study design This observational study aim describe mainly respiratory , neurological , renal dermatological feature patient TSC , LAM AML follow University São Paulo Medical Center . The study also aim establish impact disease loss productivity also establish data hospitalization study patient population . This proposal intend expand comprehension TSC pathogenesis manifestation create robust platform perform interventional clinical trial . The flow current study comprises follow step : 1 . Creation integrate database 2 . Patient selection accord inclusion criterion 3 . Data collection 4 . Data analysis assessment 5 . Interpretation result generation report 5 . Population The population study compose patient TSC , LAM AML . The estimated sample size study 200 patient . 5.1 . Inclusion criterion • All patient TSC , LAM AML follow Hospital da Clínicas , University São Paulo Medical School include propose study . Patients age participate study . 5.2 . Exclusion criterion • There exclusion criterion . 6 . Assessments This study include follow evaluation : A ) Clinical evaluation - Demographic anthropometric data - Criteria tuberous sclerosis complex ( present ) - Family history disease evaluate study - Previous current treatment - Data loss productivity hospitalization study - Quality life evaluation questionnaire Short-Form Health Survey - 36 - Characterization skin lesion - Urinary abdominal complaint - Previous current smoking - Respiratory symptom - Assessment degree dyspnea use baseline dyspnea index B ) Skin biopsy ( necessary ) C ) Abdominal ultrasonography D ) Abdominal compute tomography nuclear magnetic resonance ( suspected definitive lesion identify abdominal ultrasonography ) E ) Chest high resolution compute tomography F ) Computed tomography nuclear magnetic resonance brain G ) Electroencephalogram H ) Spirometry I ) Pulmonary volume diffusion capacity carbon monoxide ( change spirometry and/or chest high resolution compute tomography ) J ) Transthoracic echocardiography K ) Six-minute walk test ( change spirometry and/or chest high resolution compute tomography ) 7 . Data collection management Data collect stored database develop specifically study . 8 . Statistical method data analysis 8.1 . Sample size The estimate sample size study 200 patient . All patient follow Neurology , Respiratory , Nephrology , Urology Dermatology service University Sao Paulo Medical School include study . 9.2 . Population analysis We analyze data patient include database . 9.3 . Statistical method Data present mean standard deviation ( standard error ) parametric variable , define normal curve histogram , median interquartile range ( IQ ) nonparametric variable . Categorical variable express percentage . 9 . Ethical aspect 9.1 .
