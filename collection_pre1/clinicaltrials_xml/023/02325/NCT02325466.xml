	<brief_summary>The hypothesis aspirin-ticagrelor ticagrelor monotherapy superior aspirin monotherapy reduction whole blood viscosity end 4 week treatment period . Study participant randomize 3 group , group receive 3 treatment cross-over study . At end individual 4 week treatment period investigator determine whether difference low high shear rate dependent viscosity investigate effect treatment peripheral arterial blood flow use pulse volume recording , ankle brachial index toe pressure . Subjects eligible ankle-brachial index less equal 0.85 , patient 's blood vessel calcify , patient toe-brachial index less equal 0.6 perform use continuous-wave Doppler .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Efficacy Ticagrelor Versus Aspirin Blood Viscosity Peripheral Artery Disease Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ticagrelor show significantly reduce rate cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) event death compare clopidogrel patient prior acute coronary syndrome . A number outcome study demonstrate risk major CVD event increase blood viscosity . Stroke patient stroke risk factor show chronically elevate blood viscosity relative healthy control . Based prior observation , rationale study demonstrate aspirin-ticagrelor ticagrelor monotherapy superior aspirin monotherapy reduction whole blood viscosity end 4 week treatment period . The primary objective study : ( 1 ) Compare effect aspirin-ticagrelor aspirin double blind , randomize , cross-over study design ( week 1-4 , week 6-10 , week 12-16 ) blood viscosity low ( 5 s-¹ ) high ( 300 s-¹ ) shear rate end 4-week treatment period ; ( 2 ) compare effect ticagrelor mono-therapy aspirin double blind , randomize , cross-over study design ( week 1-4 , week 6-10 , week 12-16 ) blood viscosity low ( 5 s-¹ ) high ( 300 s-¹ ) end 4-week treatment . The secondary objective study include : ( 1 ) determination whether difference low high shear rate dependent viscosity treatment ticagrelor alone combination aspirin-ticagrelor . Additionally , investigated effect treatment peripheral arterial blood flow use pulse volume recording , ankle brachial index , toe pressure . The general approach evaluation drug efficacy blood sample collect standard venipuncture viscosity test . Blood viscosity measure use automate scan capillary tube viscometer across physiologic range shear rate 1-1000 s-1 increment 0.1 s-1 . Blood viscosity level 5 s-1 report low-shear viscosity , blood viscosity measurement 300 s-1 report high-shear viscosity . Additionally , pulse volume recording simultaneously obtain level ankle , metatarsal toe bilaterally accord standard protocol , Continuous-wave Doppler use determine ankle-brachial index toe-brachial index , flow velocity profile .</detailed_description>
