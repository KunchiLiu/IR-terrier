	<brief_summary>The Minimed®640G system ( MM640G ) consist combination insulin glucose sensor continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) . Here , glucose sensor transmits continuous glucose data display insulin pump , case hypoglycemia also interrupt insulin delivery pump . In currently available system Paradigm®VEO , interruption take place settle threshold level . In difference new system MM640G shutdown algorithm already proactive help avoid hypoglycemia completely . The call PLGM algorithm ( predictive low glucose management ) test user evaluation . The main objective answer question reduce rate hypoglycemia application new PLGM algorithm . Included total 24 patient , age 1-21 year , three pediatric diabetes center .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>`` MiniMed 640G System '' User Evaluation With Question Reducing Rate Hypoglycemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In first phase two week , sensor-augmented pump therapy ( SaP ) carry without interruption PLGM algorithm . In second phase 6 week , PLGM function set . Both phase compare term rate hypoglycemia , time spent area curve ( AUC ) glucose range ( value &lt; 70 mg / dl ( 3.9 mmol / l ) ) .</detailed_description>
