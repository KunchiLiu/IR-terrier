	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn amount fluid body hemodialysis patient affect . Body hydration amount fluid human body know related blood pressure . Too much fluid lead high blood pressure cause heart problem eventually lead death . Bioimpedance Spectroscopy ( BIS ) method may use measure body hydration . This applied whole body , arm , trunk , calf , leg . It non-invasive inexpensive method know risk . BIS measurement use assess optimal hydration status define patient 's ideal weight complete dialysis treatment . The investigator hypothesize target weight may better estimate BIS . The result study , particular continuous measurement calf hydration associate hydration whole body , may provide useful information physiologic ( `` healthy '' ) body hydration . It may possibly help improve treatment procedure patient future . The Renal Research Institute plan enroll 100 chronic hemodialysis patient 200 healthy control study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Estimation hydration state chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient important aspect clinical practice . Deterioration renal function often lead volume overload result hypertension simple accurate technique available measure body hydration moment . In hemodialysis ( HD ) patient , one limitation adequate ultrafiltration necessary achieve optimal hydration status ( dry weight ) inadequate vascular refill interstitial space . Blood pressure may decrease due limitation vascular refill even dry weight far achieve . Therefore , objective accurate method provide hydration state would useful clinical practice . Whole body bioimpedance technique use measure body fluid volume many year . However , difficult accurately indicate hydration state body fluid volume normal variation , accuracy measurement influence various body composition . Recently , investigator propose hydration approach use calf bioimpedance technique monitor change resistance HD . Since low limb tend contain fluid body segment ambulatory people due effect gravity , measurement calf provide accurate information body hydration HD patient . In study , investigator hypothesize : 1 . Since degree hydration great leg arm trunk due effect gravity , monitor change resistance whole part leg provide information whether optimal hydration status ( state excess extracellular fluid absent ) attain . The investigator postulate change slope resistance curve ( CSR ) calf approach zero optimal hydration status achieve . 2 . Optimal hydration status approximate comparison two value : ( 1 ) measurement local electrical resistivity interstitial compartment ( 2 ) know range resistivity healthy subject ( HS ) . Combination normalized resistivity ( Î¼ ) CSR consider indicator physiological optimal hydration status . Physiological optimal hydration status , objective index , major goal hemodialysis excess body water maximally remove accord value . In practice approach never exceed . Because flatten curve verify near normal resistivity , group healthy subject would add provide normal range resistivity age sex .</detailed_description>
