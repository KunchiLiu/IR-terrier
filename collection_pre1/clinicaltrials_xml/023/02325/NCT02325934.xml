	<brief_summary>Elvitegravir HIV-1 integrase inhibitor market fix dose combination tablet cobicistat , tenofovir emtricitabine ( StribildÂ® , refer STB ) . For patient swallow difficulty , administration whole tablet problematic tablet cut crushed ease administration . In addition HIV patient develop opportunistic infection , patient become severely ill may end intensive care . Patients intensive care might able swallow medication . Therefore useful know possible administer STB different route , like feed tube . If STB crush dissolve give catheter also useful know give drip feed . Currently information crush STB tablet . `` Crushing STB tablet liquid medium study recommend '' accord SPC text . Depending biopharmaceutical characteristic drug formulation , crush tablet lead alter pharmacokinetics drug . It important know whether pharmacokinetics influence crush tablet low concentration associate virologic failure . Therefore high dos might need . In addition , high Cmax and/or exposure lead toxicity . As result therapeutic drug monitoring advise , crush drug contra-indication base available data . It show simultaneous oral ingestion antacid elvitegravir give decrease Cmax AUC elvitegravir . This interaction show co-ingestion omeprazole . Which make unlikely interaction cause pH-lowering effect influence absorption elvitegravir . It probably local gastrointestinal complexation phenomenon , similar observe HIV integrase inhibitor . A possible pharmacokinetic interaction elvitegravir complexation former may expect . Especially consider active binding site elvitegravir bind magnesium metal ion cofactor . Although data STB ingest protein rich drink , unclear food liquid contain high amount magnesium cation cause interaction . Therefore study conduct investigate whether crush suspend STB crush suspended STB drip feed bioe-quivalent take STB whole .</brief_summary>
