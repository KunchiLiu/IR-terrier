	<brief_summary>The study aim determine pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile single oromucosal dose Sativex® ( i.e . body absorbs , distribute , metabolise excretes drug ) subject severe renal impairment end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , compare subject normal renal function . The primary clinical hypothesis effect severe renal impairment PK Sativex® administer single oromucosal dose . The study additionally aim evaluate safety tolerability single oromucosal dose Sativex® subject severe renal impairment ESRD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Pharmacokinetics Of Sativex® Subjects With Severe Renal Impairment End Stage Renal Disease , Compared Matched Subjects With Normal Renal Function .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open label , single-dose study evaluate effect renal impairment PK oromucosal dose ( four spray ) Sativex® ( contain 10.8 mg Δ9 tetrahydrocannabinol [ THC ] 10 mg cannabidiol [ CBD ] ) subject severe renal impairment ESRD ( creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min require dialysis ) compare matched subject normal renal function ( creatinine clearance &gt; 80 mL/min ) . Eligible subject give single oromucosal dose ( four spray ) Sativex® Dosing Day 1 . Serial blood urine sample determination concentration THC , 11-hydroxy- Δ9 - tetrahydrocannabinol ( 11-OH-THC ) , CBD , 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol ( 7- OH-CBD ) collect subject severe renal impairment ESRD , require dialysis , matched subject normal renal function 48 hour dose select time point . Pre-dose blood sample also collect protein binding measurement . Safety tolerability evaluate Day -2 post-study follow-up visit . The Follow-up Safety visit perform 7 day Sativex® dosing ( + 2 day ) . The expected maximum duration study participation ( include Screening , Inpatient Period , Follow-up ) individual subject maximum 24 day .</detailed_description>
