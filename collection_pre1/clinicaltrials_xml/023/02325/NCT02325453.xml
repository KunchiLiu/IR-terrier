	<brief_title>Robotic , Laparoscopic Open Surgery Gastric Cancer Compared Surgical , Clinical Oncological Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall purpose : The Overall purpose develop multi-institutional database comprise information regard surgical , clinical oncological feature patient undergo surgery gastric cancer robotic , laparoscopic open approach subsequent follow-up participating center . General study design : The registry establish retrospectively identify subject gastric cancer treat participate center . Information gather obtain exist data record , diagnostic test surgical intervention . Information collect record institute specific online share system . Main objective : - To determine surgical , clinical , oncological outcome short long term - To compare result accord type intervention , device use manner execution different surgical phase - To relate result different surgery baseline characteristic patient stage disease Clinical relevance : Studies report result minimally invasive surgery gastric cancer recent meta-analysis emphasize need large trial . A consideration field regard need numerous patient reach statistical significance surgical , clinical oncological outcome , order fully assess effectiveness difference different surgical approach . At present , multicenter registry may represent best research tool assess role minimally invasive approach compare method traditional open surgery . Therefore , project , large registry create collect data different participate center create work basis analyze outcomes interest obtain direction investigation . The data collect clarify role laparoscopic robotic surgery versus open approach term : - safety feasibility base intraoperative outcome - respect oncological principle relation stage location tumor - recovery gastrointestinal function consider outcome measure postoperative hospital stay - incidence , type severity postoperative complication - overall survival disease-free survival Duration study : The begin trial schedule January 2015 . It expect end chart review within one year . Type data collection : In present study , follow information collect : - Patient Demographics - Surgical Procedure detail - Tumor characteristic - Operative finding - Post-operative clinical finding - Post-operative complication - Follow-up detail Statistical analysis : The dichotomous variable express number percentage , continuous variable express mean standard deviation ( SD ) median interquartile range ( minimum maximum value ) . Continuous variable , compare use one-way ANOVA post hoc multiple comparison Tukey 's procedure . Pearson 's χ2 test Fisher 's exact test , appropriate , use analysis categorical data . For test value alpha ( α ) &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Potential risk safety management : Participation research registry involve potential risk breach confidentiality medical record information associate privacy participant . Such risk minimize use establishment appropriate information technology service .</detailed_description>
