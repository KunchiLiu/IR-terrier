	<detailed_description>Introduction The relationship viral bacterial infection respiratory tract child long learnt document medical literature . A large scale American study hold `` swine flu '' ( influenza A H1N1 ) pandemic 2009-2010 document pneumonia ( pulmonary infection ) bacterial source one third patient admit intensive care unit ( PICU - Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ) [ 1 ] . Similar data even high incidence rate also exist bronchiolitis cause RSV ( respiratory syncytial virus ) [ 2 ] . These similar study raise question real need antibiotic treatment whether judiciously prescribe ( turn , example , place world 30-90 % viral bronchiolitis case treat antibiotic [ 3 ] ) , put patient risk side effect potentially increase bacterial resistance . Moreover , one ignore fact otherwise healthy child child comorbidity ( chronic carrier state relevant background disease ) always address separately study . Despite , consensus child respiratory viral disease , mainly one require hospitalization PICU , benefit empirical antibiotic treatment [ 4 , 5 ] . On hand , come potential impact antiviral treatment course pulmonary bacterial disease infection influenza virus , result encourage , seasonal vaccination play key role reduce morbidity [ 6 ] . As whether presence viral infection time affect severity pulmonary bacterial infection ( i.e . The disease serious viral origin ) , evidence demonstrate increase mortality , duration mechanical ventilation duration hospitalization mixed bacterial viral disease [ 7 ] . Several study find isolated virus different type respiratory ailment , unanimity whether correlation number viruses severity disease miss [ 8 , 9 ] . In addition multiplicity source deal link viral bacterial respiratory infection , especially influenza RSV , recent evidence literature viral-bacterial etiology acute otitis medium [ 10 , 11 ] , far limited number work make relationship virus system . The goal article : 1 . To determine whether data available context mixed infection respiratory disease ( see ) also valid disease body system . 2 . To discover whether relationship viral bacterial infection strong respiratory system 3. study impact co‐infection morbidity ( severity , length stay , complication ) 4. link specific infection common mixed pathogen 5. specify age section , gender , demographic characteristic , clinical condition , co-infections ( relevant consequence ) predominate Methods The study group comprise currently recently febrile , otherwise healthy child age 0 17 year admit several medical center ( Hillel Yaffe , Bnai Zion ) Israel , find viral , bacterial infection . Exclusion criterion list ( Table 1 ) . When child meeting criterion admit , parent ( child 's legal custodian ) give verbal write explanation clinical investigator , sign informed consent approve collect blood sample nasal rectal swab . In accordance clinical presentation , additional test perform included blood , urine stool culture viral bacterial serology . For patient , individual history take ; present symptom , physical examination lab result document ; additional data antibiotic therapy , length stay complication collect hospitalization authorize medical staff use standard technique method . Specimen sample : - Nasal swab - Blood sample CBC chemistry tube - Rectal swab ( case diarrhea ) Laboratory procedure : Specimens immediately place refrigerator 4°C , transfer MeMed laboratory longer 5 hour follow sample . In laboratory , blood test include CBC , bacterial viral PCR incl . ELISA . Although clinical sign usually document great detail , method problematic prone bias purpose define infection , owe investigator 's individual interpretation . Thus , study microbiological definition use . Viral infection define PCR positive viral genome presence IgM antibody viral specific antigen . Bacterial infection require PCR positive bacterial genome sequence , colony count 105 cfu/ml diagnostic sample single specie obtain , presence IgM antibody bacterial specific . Data analysis : All information transfer arrange designated database develop maintain sub-investigators . In database , investigator apply exclusion criterion , find patient viral bacterial co-infections analyze investigated variant . Table 1 : Exclusion Criteria Afebrile 72 hour Chronic illness Immune compromise ( due immunosuppressive drug , neoplastic disease , etc . ) History prematurity IUGR Not fully vaccinate age accord national routine vaccination program Infection primary diagnosis Under antibiotic therapy : Currently receive Recently receive ( less 48 hour ) No infection document research period</detailed_description>
