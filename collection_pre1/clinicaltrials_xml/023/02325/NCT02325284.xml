	<detailed_description>It generally recognize pain assessment management newborns child unmet need . According American Medical Association , `` The pediatric population risk inadequate pain management , age-related factor affect pain management child . Children often give minimal analgesia procedure would routinely treat aggressively adult . Although much know pain management child , widely effectively translate routine clinical practice . `` 1 Although clinically validate method exist ( e.g . CRIES , PPIP , Faces , etc . ) , `` gold standard '' pain assessment adopt clinical practice . All hinder ambiguous behavioral correlate pain stimuli standard well subjective variability inherent clinical parent evaluator 2 . Other apparatus/methods pain assessment suffer similar shortcoming . For example , pain tolerance threshold ( PTT ) current perception threshold ( CPT ) determination rely verbal response patient . Those determination subjective semi-quantitative use electrical stimulation directly excite large small diameter sensory nerve fiber . The CPT determination represent minimum amount potentially noxious electrical stimulus perceive , PTT determination represent maximum amount noxious electrical stimulation tolerate used clinical diagnostic tool . Thus , PTT depend subject 's verbal response require patient exposure aversive electrical stimulation , cause undesirable discomfort also elicit affective component pain . Therefore , development tool assessment management pain newborns child high priority represent significant unmet medical need . Both inadequately treat pain administration analgesic deleterious physiologic consequence neonate , infant child . While number method use , `` gold standard '' pain assessment exists . ( Anand 2007 ) To accomplish meaningful pain management child one must first able objectively assess pain , particularly patient ( 1 ) non-verbal ( e.g . neonate , infant ) , ( 2 ) lack understand adequate verbalization skill ( e.g . young child , developmentally disabled individual ) ( 3 ) patient compromise neuropathic clinical presentation . To address critical issue pain management , Human Algometer method development Drs . Finkel Quezado Pain Medicine Program Sheikh Zayed Institute . In brief , device integrates neurospecific neurostimulation sensory nerve fiber involve pain response near infra-red spectroscopy ( NIRS ) signal acquisition derive pain related hemodynamic change somatosensory cortex . The device ability collect data NIRS response cerebral cortex noxious stimulation provide neurostimulation component . Signal processing data trial subsequent trial result ( 1 ) detection optimization NIRS signal specific increase neuronal blood flow somatosensory cortex ( nociceptive response ) frontal cortex ( affective component ) . The individual neurostimulatory NIRS signal acquisition component integrate novel device base part whole previously FDA approve device Neurotron , Inc. Covidien plc ( former Somanetics INVOS â„¢ ) respectively .</detailed_description>
