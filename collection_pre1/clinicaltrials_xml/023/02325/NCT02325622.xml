	<brief_summary>The liver play crucial role physiological glycemic control involvement several glucose metabolism process , include glycogenogenesis glycogenolysis . Liver diseases result impair glucose metabolism due hepatocyte dysfunction , term `` hepatogenous diabetes '' . Abnormal glucose metabolism find 90 % patient liver cirrhosis . clinically significant diabetes know occur 30 % 70 % patient . A cohort study cirrhotic patient hepatogenous diabetes report relatively low diabetic complication rate , majority mortality cause complication relate liver cirrhosis ; furthermore , mortality rate due diabetic complication report low . Nonetheless , average survival rate follow diagnosis liver cirrhosis rise due increase early detection rate improvement treatment modality , rise survival expect result increase prevalence hepatogenous diabetes complication . Therefore , necessary formulate accurate diagnosis hepatogenous provide appropriate treatment . Analyses Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) demonstrate association glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) mean plasma glucose concentration diabetic patient , currently , HbA1c employ appropriate marker diagnose diabetes mellitus monitor control mean blood glucose . The association mean plasma glucose concentration HbA1c cirrhotic patient clearly establish yet ; however , HbA1c cirrhotic patient expect influenced various factor result liver cirrhosis splenomegaly , include rapid erythrocyte turnover rate glycation process . Therefore , HbA1c may appropriate indicator diagnosis hepatogenous diabetes monitor glycemic control ; however , systemic study issue perform far . Therefore , investigator aim investigate association mean plasma glucose concentration HbA1c patient compensate decompensated liver cirrhosis also hepatogenous diabetes .</brief_summary>
