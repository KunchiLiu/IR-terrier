	<brief_summary>Dapagliflozin effective lower glucose hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1C ) subject tpye 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) , study monotherapy well combination insulin oral anti-diabetic medications.This lead investigation therapy would also benefit type 1 diabetes intensive insulin therapy associate glucose fluctuation , hypoglycemia , weight gain , subsequent insulin resistance , may reduce efficacy . The purpose pilot study collect clinical data HbA1c-dependent effect single-dose 10mg dapagliflozin insulin dose administer intravenously glucose-infusion oral mixed-meal ensue 24 hour blood glucose keep 160 - 220 mg/dl . The first objective investigate degree insulin dose reduction 24 hour single dose 10mg dapagliflozin patient type 1 diabetes Further objective investigate - effect urinary glucose excretion - effect influenced baseline glycemic control - dapagliflozin influence postprandial insulin need - dapagliflozin associate elevated ß-hydroxybutyrate level - PK oral administration 10mg dapagliflozin</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study Explore Safety Pharmacokinetics DAPAglifozin Adolescents Adults With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety profile tolerability , particularly regard hypoglycemia ketone development , follow daily oral dose 10 mg dapagliflozin administer subject type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) single dose well pharmacokinetics ( PK ) 18 hour treatment . The study aim patient different degree inadequate glycemic control despite insulin use . Approximately 36 subject screen order randomize 10 patient different HbA1C category . The trial consist six visit : screen visit ( Visit 1 ) , two dose visit ( Visit 2 Visit 4 ) , two phone visit ( Visit 3 Visit 5 ) follow-up visit ( Visit 6 ) . Furthermore , information visit take place prior screen visit order obtain patient 's informed consent . Screening take place 2-21 day prior Visit 2 follow-up visit take place 5-21 day end Visit 4 . The dose visit separate wash-out period ( 5-30 day end Visit 2 begin Visit 4 ) subject resume normal insulin treatment . Each phone visit ( Visit 3 Visit 5 ) take place 3-5 day end dose Visits 2 4 . The planned total duration trial 18-78 day per subject ( rescheduled visit exclude ) . Each subject randomise treatment sequence consist two treatment period subject receive dapagliflozin placebo two separate dose visit . Subjects metabolic control achieve variable i.v . infusion human insulin infusion pump . The procedure use order aim maintain blood glucose level 160 220 mg/dl thereby range urinary threshold glucose . The fluid infusion insulin dose scheme depend body weight ( BW ) blood glucose ( BG ) level . Two standardized mixed-meals give 6 hour 12 hour dose . Blood glucose measurement perform every 15min 120min mixed-meal . Blood sample determination dapagliflozin concentration serum take 18times 24hours well every urine sample collect 24 hour dose determination 24hour urinary glucose creatinine efficacy measurement . After conclusion trial document insulin dos time sum calculation total insulin dose insulin dose per kg body weight per 24 hour . Separate calculation do overnight period pre-dosing , six hour dose , two hour prior first second Standard Meal end visit .</detailed_description>
