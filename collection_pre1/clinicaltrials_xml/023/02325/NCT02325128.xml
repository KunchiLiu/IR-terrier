	<brief_summary>Investigators examine whether post-exposure nap use strengthen therapeutic extinction memory form exposure therapy extreme social anxiety . Thirty-two individual high level social anxiety , evidence score 60 great Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale , self-report clinical interview demonstrate enhanced psychophysiological reactivity imagine socially stressful scenario , enrol one four participant one eight successive offering validate 5-session exposure-based group treatment extreme social anxiety . The third fourth session conclude participant delivering speech topic individually choose elicit significant social anxiety . Following session , participant go sleep laboratory two give 2-hour sleep opportunity polysomnographic ( PSG ) monitor two similarly instrument undergo 2 hour monitor quiet wakefulness . Before treatment , participant individually assess social anxiety symptom use standardized self-report instrument Trier Social Stress Test ( TSST ) modify continuous psychophysiological monitoring . Ambulatory monitoring home sleep also obtain use actigraphy sleep diary . The investigator hypothesize , post treatment , individual nap show great questionnaire-based clinical improvement well lesser psychophysiological reactivity modify TSST compare remain quietly awake . The investigator hypothesize characteristic sleep quality architecture nap , specifically duration total sleep , REM slow-wave sleep , well REM continuity , predict great clinical improvement lesser psychophysiological reactivity TSST nap follow third fourth therapy session .

	<detailed_description>Widely replicate study demonstrate sleep enhance memory consolidation . Potential clinical application finding begin explore . The investigator recently show nocturnal sleep follow simulated exposure therapy high level spider fear reduce psychophysiological self-reported reactivity participant re-exposed novel spider stimulus . The propose research extend finding debilitate clinically important condition extreme social anxiety . The investigator examine whether post-exposure nap use strengthen therapeutic extinction memory form exposure exercise use behavioral treatment extreme social anxiety . A total 32 individual high level social anxiety , evidence score 60 great Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale , self-report clinical interview demonstrate enhanced psychophysiological reactivity imagine socially stressful scenario , enrol exposure-based group treatment extreme social anxiety . Eight successive therapy group 4 patient offer 2-year funding period . The third fourth session validate 5-week/5-session treatment involve participant deliver speech topic individually choose elicit significant social anxiety . Following session , 4 participant go nearby Massachusetts General Hospital sleep laboratory 2 give 2-hour sleep opportunity polysomnographic ( PSG ) monitor 2 similarly instrument undergo 2 hour monitor quiet wakefulness ( prior session 3 participant randomized sleep wakefulness arm ) . Before begin treatment within several day follow final treatment session , participant individually assess social anxiety symptom use standardized self-report instrument . At time , undergo Trier Social Stress Test ( TSST ) modify continuous psychophysiological monitoring also include repeated Subjective Units Distress ( SUDS ) self report sample salivary cortisol . In addition laboratory PSG , ambulatory monitoring home sleep actigraphy sleep diary take place pre-treatment baseline last 3 week treatment . The investigator hypothesize individual allow 2-hour sleep opportunity follow exposure session , compare remain quietly awake , show great questionnaire-based clinical improvement well lesser psychophysiological SUDS reactivity modify TSST . The investigator hypothesize characteristic sleep quality architecture nap , specifically duration total sleep , REM sleep slow-wave sleep well REM continuity , predict clinical improvement diminish TSST reactivity nap . To help ensure observed sleep effect attributable two 2-hour sleep opportunity , investigator control actigraph diary-measured sleep quality treatment . Positive result provide first proof-of-principle sleep augmentation exposure therapy clinically significant extreme social anxiety .</detailed_description>
