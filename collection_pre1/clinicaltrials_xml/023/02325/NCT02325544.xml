	<brief_summary>The study test hypothesis Cognitive Behavioural Therapy plus Standardised Medical Care ( SMC ) great clinical cost effectiveness SMC alone treat adult patient dissociative seizure initially cease diagnosis . About 12-20 % patient attend neurology specialist epilepsy clinic seizures fact epilepsy . Most people refer dissociative ( non-epileptic ) seizure ( DS ) . This mean episodes resemble epileptic seizure medical reason occurrence instead due psychological factor . In young adult DS four time common woman men . A high percentage people psychological psychiatric problem may medically unexplained symptom . It generally think people DS benefit psychological treatment . However , study small compare psychological therapy treatment people normally receive ( standardise medical care ) . There evidence cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) , widely accept talk therapy focus person 's thought , emotion behaviour , well consider physical reaction sensation may occur people 's body , may lead reduction often people DS . The investigator previously develop CBT package people DS . In relatively small study group , publish 2010 , people receive CBT overall show great reduction often DS . The investigator conduct large study , across several different hospital , obtain definite result effectiveness CBT approach DS . The investigator aim invite ~ 500 adult patient DS ( without current active epilepsy ) , give diagnosis neurologist specialist epilepsy , take part study . Up 698 might invite insufficient patient progress RCT . The investigator collect initial information people ask keep record often DS follow diagnosis . Three month diagnosis , agree take part study see psychiatrist , undertake psychiatric assessment ask factor may lead development DS . Patients continue DS previous 8 week meet eligibility criterion willing take part trial , randomly allocate standardise medical care CBT ( plus standardise medical care ) treatment seizure . These people ask continue complete seizure diary questionnaires , provide regular seizure frequency data follow receipt DS diagnosis need willing attend weekly/fortnightly session allocate CBT . The investigator initially aim randomise 298 people ( 149 study arm ) although allow 356 account loss follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There initial observational phase study follow parallel group , two-arm multi-centre pragmatic randomise control trial ( interventional phase ) . In observational phase patient give diagnosis dissociative seizure neurologist/epilepsy specialist tell CODES study . In addition leaflet dissociative seizure , interested study willing referred psychiatrist , give information sheet DS study doctor document agreement contact research nurse/worker . This person arrange contact , clarify study detail , obtain informed consent , collect demographic detail explain seizure diary recording . They contact patient fortnightly ( bi-weekly ) seizure data . The investigator initially aim recruit ~500 patient stage . After 3 month patient review neuropsychiatrist/ liaison psychiatrist/ psychiatrist interest DS undertake clinical assessment , review patient 's eligibility interventional phase study eligible explain RCT . Patients give leaflet DS Participant Information Sheet psychiatrist document interested patient ' willingness contact research nurse/worker . That person explain RCT great detail , obtain informed consent , undertake baseline assessment include MINI instruct patient keep seizure record data collect fortnightly . .Randomisation 298 356 people ( depend follow-up rate ) either CBT plus standardise medical care ( SMC ) SMC alone occur informed consent obtain baseline measure collect . The stratification factor liaison/neuropsychiatry centre . The research worker trial statistician remain blind . Computer-generated randomisation conduct remotely ( detail see www.ctu.co.uk - randomisation - advanced ) King 's Clinical Trials Unit ( KCTU ) Institute Psychiatry , Psychology Neuroscience . The investigator maintain strict allocation concealment . The investigator test RWs ' blind ask record think allocation reveal record group think patient allocate . CBT deliver 12 session ( approximately one hour length ) 4-5 month period one booster session 9 month post randomisation . The investigator ' treatment model develop single case study , trialled open label study Pilot RCT . The model base two-process fear escape-avoidance model conceptualise DS dissociative response cue ( cognitive/emotional/physiological environmental ) may ( case ) associate profoundly distress life-threatening experience , abuse trauma , early stage person 's life previously produce intolerable feeling fear distress . Written handouts supplement content face-to face therapy session . The investigator record therapy session undertake treatment fidelity rating . Therapists receive train prior treat study patient . Neurologists psychiatrists interest DS deliver standardise medical care ( SMC ) . They guideline delivery standardise medical care . Information leaflet give patient . The research team provide material . SMC psychiatrist include support , consideration psychiatric comorbidities associate drug treatment general review CBT technique .

Inclusion criterion evaluate randomisation stage follow : adult ( ≥18yrs ) DS initially recruit point diagnosis ; willingness continue complete seizure diary questionnaires ; provision regular seizure frequency data follow receipt DS diagnosis ; willingness attend weekly/fortnightly session randomise CBT clinician patient think randomisation acceptable ability give write informed consent . The exclusion criterion apply initial recruitment stage follow : diagnosis current epileptic seizure well DS . Patients DS ES include small study method verify patient accurately differentiate epileptic seizure DS ; inability keep seizure record complete questionnaire independently ; meet DSMIV criterion current drug/alcohol dependence ; insufficient command English later undergo CBT without interpreter complete questionnaire independently . Reasons include need selfrate secondary outcome use scale validate nonEnglish speaking population , considerable cost uncertainty able reliably engage sufficiently competent interpreter , need demonstrate delivery therapy term quality manual adherence . previously undergone CBTbased treatment dissociative seizure trial participate centre currently CBT another disorder , end time psychiatric assessment take place . Exclusion criterion evaluate randomisation stage follow : current epileptic seizure well DS , reason give ; DS 8 week prior psychiatric assessment , 3 month post diagnosis ; previously undergone CBTbased treatment dissociative seizure trial participate centre currently CBT another disorder active psychosis ; meeting DSMIV criterion current drug/alcohol dependence ; may exacerbate symptoms/alter psychiatric state health service use affect recording seizure ; current benzodiazepine use exceed equivalent 10mg diazepam/day ; patient think imminent risk self harm , ( neuro ) psychiatric assessment structure psychiatric assessment Research Worker MINI , follow consultation psychiatrist . know diagnosis Factitious Disorder</criteria>
