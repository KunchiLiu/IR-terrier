	<brief_title>Assessment Proposed Microbiological Alert Its Impact Sepsis Campaign</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis one major challenge modern medicine . It important health problem high incidence , morbidity mortality affect population worldwide . Without early recognition prompt management , patient develop severe stage disease even death . An appropriate aggressive management significantly improve outcome . Thus , necessary develop early warning system sepsis hospital . In recent year , several campaign guideline develop help health care professional management sepsis . However , mainly focus management protocol severe sepsis septic shock intensive care unit emergency department . To best investigator knowledge , none examine depth either impact sepsis alert system general ward , impact telephone call specialist Clinical Microbiology , upon blood culture request , early recognition sepsis . The aim present study evaluate ability health-care professional address sepsis , impact telephone call upon receival blood culture clinical microbiology department , clinical microbiologist , early management sepsis . For , investigator perform prospective study base telephone call follow phone interview physicians nurse charge patient whose blood culture receive clinical microbiology department tertiary hospital .</detailed_description>
