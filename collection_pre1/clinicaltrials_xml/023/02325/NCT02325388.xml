	<detailed_description>Background : Pressure ulcer result substantial financial cost healthcare system well significant distress affect patient family . As interface pressure key risk factor development pressure ulcer , continuous visual feedback continuous pressure imaging ( CPI ) body support surface could inform healthcare provider reposition strategy play key role overall strategy prevention management pressure ulcer . This randomize , control trial aim study effect CPI reduction interface pressure , incidence pressure ulcer vulnerable hospital patient . Methods : A parallel two-group randomize controlled clinical trial conduct . A total 678 eligible consent inpatient high risk pressure ulcer development tertiary acute care institution randomly allocate either ForeSite PT™ system liquid-crystal display ( `` LCD '' ) monitor turn provide visual feedback CPI healthcare provider also collect continuous interface pressure data ( intervention group ) , ForeSite PT™ system LCD monitor turn , therefore provide visual feedback CPI healthcare provider , collect continuous interface pressure data background ( control group ) , ratio 1:1 . Data collect group three day ( 72 hour ) . The primary outcome difference two group ' interface pressure analysis . The interface pressure reading collect hourly sample continuous interface pressure record take throughout study period . Clinical outcome difference two group ' pressure-related skin soft tissue change area risk pressure ulcer . It obtain baseline ( within 24 hour admission ) third day trial . Perceptions intervention patient healthcare provider obtain third day . Discussion : This first randomize control trial investigate effect CPI interface pressure vulnerable hospital patient , association interface pressure development pressure-related skin soft tissue change . The result could provide important information guide clinical practice prevention management pressure ulcer .</detailed_description>
