	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Anagliptin Sitagliptin effective reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol patient type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk factor statin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Evaluation Anagliptin Versus Sitagliptin On Low-density lipoproteiN Cholesterol Diabetes Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes significant cause cardiovascular cerebrovascular event . Especially , diabetic patient cardiovascular risk factor significantly high risk cardiovascular cerebrovasculara event . Therefore , several medical management strategy include anti-diabetic medication statin consider patient . However , spite treatment , still many patient cardiovascular cerebrovascular event . One hypothesis residual risk elevate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDLC ) even statin therapy . Anagliptin , one dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP4 ) inhibiors , report reduce LDLC may pontential decrease cardiovascular cerebrovascular risk patient statin . We , thus , conduct randomize controlled trial compare Anagliptin Sitagliptin term change LDLC 52 week well glycemic control .</detailed_description>
