	<brief_summary>This single center study safety efficacy Juvedérm Voluma treatment hypognathism . Each qualify subject undergo treatment Juvedérm Voluma anterior lateral chin volume correction . Prior treatment , principal investigator evaluate severity chin recession use 90 degree image goniometer measure angle glabella chin . Subjects eligible injection angle measure 145 - 160 degree . Facial digital photography capture prior treatment subsequent visit . The subject complete safety injection site response ( ISR ) diary begin even treatment . The subject return Day 3 Day 14 initial treatment , time subject undergo photography investigator rate treatment improvement ( GAIS ) . An independent image analysis technician ass degree correction . The investigator evaluate treatment area adverse event ( AEs ) . The subject return 30 day initial treatment , principal investigator determine touch-up treatment warrant . If deem necessary , touch-up treatment may administer . Facial digital photography capture prior treatment follow treatment . The subject return 3 day touch-up undergo digital photography principal investigator assess safety/improvement . After initial touch-up treatment , whichever last , routine follow-up visit safety effectiveness occur 1 ( 30 day ) , 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 ( telephone call ) 12 month . At follow-up visit , facial digital photography capture investigator rate treatment improvement ( GAIS ) .. At screen Months 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 month 12 subject complete satisfaction face overall module FACE-Q questionnaire . The goal study assess feasibility Voluma XC treatment hypoplastic chin</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Juvederm Voluma® XC Treatment Hypoplastic Chin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To evaluate efficacy Voluma XC treatment hypoplastic chin . Secondary Objective : To evaluate patient satisfaction improvement GAIS follow treatment Voluma hypoplastic chin . The expected outcome follow deep ( dermal and/or supra periosteal ) injection Voluma use treat hypognathism significant improvement facial angle chin . Significant improvement define mean change facial angle face measure blinded digital image analysis technician . A secondary effectiveness measure patient treat investigator measure improvement use FACE-Q questionnaire well mean change GAIS score . The study span total approximately 15 month : estimate 2 month recruitment 12 month follow-up . Each subject 's participation encompass screening/baseline visit , Day 3 Day 14 visit possible 1 month touch ( touch occurs day 3 day 14 month 1 occur follow touch follow study visit 2 , 4 , 6 , month 9 month telephone safety visit 12 month clinic visit ( end study ) . JUVÉDERM® Voluma XC Injectable Gel No control treatment use . The primary effectiveness endpoint one month optimal correction attain accord investigator . The image analysis technician perform evaluation blind amount product inject . All digital photo analyze batch , randomize format ( include pre-treatment photo ) order blind technician . Retreatment Criteria ( applicable ) Study subject return possible touch 1 month follow initial injection . At time , investigator subject evaluate outcome initial treatment . In event subject investigator concur additional treatment indicate suboptimal aesthetic correction , repeat injection Voluma XC perform . If repeat treatment take place subject follow Day 3 Day 14 Day 30 . In event subject want retreatment subject remain study follow course trial . The subject undergo treatment return follow-up visit throughout study period . At visit , Principal Investigator designee record AEs concomitant medication , therapy , treatment . All report AEs document . The procedure perform visit described . Injections Voluma accomplish use serial puncture fan technique needle inserted periosteal plane well subcutaneous plane . The treatment area include medial lateral chin define : lateral chin landmark depressor anguli oris . Photography mandatory participate clinical trial . Subjects consent allow Kenneth R. Beer , M.D. , PA permission use photograph FDA advisory panel meeting , scientific journal conference , advertising , publicity , promotional purpose one option . Additional option give subject allow Kenneth R. Beer , M.D. , PA use photographs FDA advisory panel meeting scientific journal conference , NOT permission use photograph advertising , publicity , promotional purpose option 2 . The third final option allows subject photograph take , subject NOT give permission use photograph FDA advisory panel meeting , scientific journal conference , advertising , publicity , promotional purpose . The photograph take 3D photography system analyzed third party hire sponsor . Full confidentiality maintain due entire face photograph . Confidentiality try maintain use subject identifier . If late date subject want photo use purpose consent subject time course study allow change update photograph consent . If subject withdraws photo consent subject discontinue study since photograph mandatory participate clinical study . The Principal Investigator ensure subject meet eligibility criterion . The Principal Investigator capture 90 degree angle photo use goniometer manually measure angle glabella mentalis subject angle 145-160° include study . The Principal Investigator designee record reason subject withdraw consent prior randomization meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . The Principal Investigator designee collect record subject 's demographic information , medical surgical history , cosmetic procedure history , Fitzpatrick skin phototype . Initial Treatment Visit ( Day 0 ) If Screening Day 0 visit day , procedure perform Screening perform Screening perform , prior treatment administration . Prior treatment , vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , respiration rate , temperature ) measure . Study staff attain subject demographic , medical , cosmetic , dental history . A negative UPT test confirm prior randomization . Photos take Canfield Vectra 3D system . Subjects ask complete FACE-Q questionnaire license Memorial Sloan Kettering ( 3 ) . Concomitant medication capture . A subject diary give subject complete 30 day . A Investigator assessment chin function complete prior injection . Day 3 ( +/- 2days ) Subject return clinic Day 3 follow . Subject photograph Canfield Vectra 3D system investigator rate improvement use GAIS score Investigator Assessment chin function . Day 14 ( +/-3 day ) Subject return clinic Day 14 follow . Subject photograph Canfield Vectra 3D system investigator rate improvement use GAIS score Investigator Assessment chin function . Day 30 retreatment visit Month 1 visit ( +/-7days ) Subject assess investigator determine retreatment need . If retreatment occur visit become one month visit . Month 1 Visit Subject photograph Canfield Vectra 3D system , investigator GAIS score FACE Q questionnaire complete , adverse event capture , collection diary , concurrent procedure document . Retreatment Visit If retreatment need visit schedule follow date retreatment day 3 ( +/- 2 day ) , day 14 ( +/- 3 day ) day 30 ( +/- 7 day ) . Subject investigator complete Month 1 visit requirement document . ( Same procedure follow initial injection ) Month 2 ( +/- 14 day ) Subject photograph Canfield Vectra 3D system , investigator GAIS score , Investigator Assessment chin function , Face Q questionnaire , adverse event concurrent procedure capture . Month 4 ( +/- 14 day ) Subject photograph Canfield Vectra 3D system , investigator GAIS score , Investigator Assessment chin function , Face Q questionnaire , adverse event concurrent procedure capture . Month 6 ( +/- 14 day ) Subject photograph Canfield Vectra 3D system , investigator GAIS score , Investigator Assessment chin function , Face Q questionnaire , adverse event concurrent procedure capture . Month 9 ( +/- 14 day ) telephone safety call Subject call review new concomitant medication new adverse event since month 6 visit . 10 Month 12 ( +/-14 day ) End Study Visit Subject photograph Canfield Vectra 3D system , investigator GAIS score , Investigator Assessment chin function , Face Q questionnaire , adverse event concurrent procedure capture . End Study page complete Instructions Subjects - Following injection Voluma , application ice 10 minute per hour awake may help reduce swell may use period 3-5 day . - Discomfort may treat acetaminophen . - Gentle massage may also use minimize lump bump common first 7 day follow treatment .</detailed_description>
