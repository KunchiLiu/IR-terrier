The expert committee close contact developer . The pre-final version pre-tested 40 person foot ankle disorder . They complete questionnaire interview meaning question response order ensure adapt version retain equivalence apply situation . Possible miss response look . The last step submit final version , FAAM-Fi write report committee keep track translate version developer final version . Process validate FAAM-Fi include test reliability , validity responsiveness . 80 patient receive either conservative operative treatment foot ankle disorder recruit Turku University Hospital Physiotherapy Consults , Helsinki . 40 patient treat operatively 40 conservatively . 40 patient receive operative treatment Turku University Hospital Foot ankle unit ask answer question Finnish version FAAM , modify AOFAS foot ankle scale 15-D instrument paper electrical version . At outpatient clinic Turku University Hospital Physiotherapy Consults Helsinki 40 foot ankle patient get physiotherapy fill form . 20 patient recruit Turku University Hospital 20 Physiotherapy Consults Helsinki .
