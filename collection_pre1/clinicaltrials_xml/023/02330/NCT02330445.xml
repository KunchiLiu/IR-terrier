Secondary Objective ( ) To assess rheumatoid arthritis activity period PRTX-100 treatment To evaluate development anti-PRTX-100 antibody To explore feasibility joint evaluation ultrasound To explore feasibility biomarkers disease marker</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>6-Month Phase I/II Open Label PRTX-100 Previous Rheumatoid Arthritis Study Participants Sera Collection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although majority RA patient achieve amelioration RA old disease modify agent methotrexate leflunomide , agent provoke adverse event . The new active biological agent distinct safety profile include increase risk serious infection . They annual treatment expense tens thousand dollar year . PRTX-100 may able modify disease course rheumatoid arthritis improve safety profile compare available agent dose regimen comparable therapy currently available . This study do describe adverse event profile 6 Î¼g/kg PRTX-100 administer IV long period treatment might require RA therapy . Secondary objective include : evaluation clinical response subject previous administration PRTX-100 ; evaluation anti-PRTX antibody presence effect activity ; evaluation `` Power Doppler '' ultrasound assessment joint inflammation ; evaluation biomarkers . Assay development intrinsic part drug biological development . The current assay anti-PRTX-100 antibody depend limited supply serum available individual early trial . It necessary obtain adequate antiserum provide immunological reagent assay . It know whether character anti-PRTX-100 antibody volunteer similar produce patient immunological disorder cytotoxic therapy . Antisera develop normal volunteer . The anti-PRTX-100 antibody assay need standardized new anti-PRTX-100 antibody source compare present human reagent .</detailed_description>
