	<detailed_description>Background : There urgent need develop evaluate innovative , evidence-based , sustainable approach pediatric obesity accessible setting . One approach , screen , brief intervention , referral treatment ( SBIRT ) , use address preventable health concern , hazardous drinking ; time- resource-limited approach delivers brief , theoretically-driven intervention increase awareness health concern provide respondent feedback information relevant resource . This approach suit obesity prevention enhance parent ' awareness concern child 's lifestyle behavior , remove social barrier provide anonymity family , overcome limited availability obesity-related health service . Setting . This study take place centrally-located Edmonton pediatric clinic house within Edmonton Oliver Primary Care Network ( EOPCN ) . Primary care ( PC ) represent accessible , relevant , appropriate venue prevent pediatric obesity ( ) PC often represent family ' first point contact health care system , ( ii ) goal priority PC clinic well-aligned primary secondary prevention chronic disease , ( iii ) patient typically access health care service throughout life course , therefore represent suitable environment capture longitudinal data . Phase I . The objective phase develop web-based , theoretically-driven SBIRT enhance parent ' awareness , concern , motivation support child 's lifestyle behavior . The SBIRT ( RIPPLE ; Resource Information Program Parents Lifestyle Education ) screen child weight status , deliver brief intervention regard child 's lifestyle behavior parent , provide parent menu resource community resource facilitate prevention obesity child . The intervention inform Norm Activation Model , survey follow intervention test psychosocial construct Theory Planned Behavior Health Belief Model . Parents receive personalize report base intervention response select resource service ; parent option email report . Phase II . The objective phase refine SBIRT use focus group . Participants ( n=30 ) include parent , pediatric-focused administrator , health care provider , research coordinator , graduate trainee . Focus group query participant ' overall perception program ; specifically , impression regard likability , acceptability , satisfaction , feasibility incorporate intervention clinical practice . Focus group discussion transcribe real-time use court reporter , optimize transcription accuracy ensure confidentiality . The method Qualitative Description ( QD ) use develop rich explicit description phenomenon . QD necessitate less interpretive interference behalf researcher , therefore represent accurate realistic embodiment participant ' discussion . Phase III ( RCT ) . The objective phase recruit parent ( n=200 ) pediatric primary care clinic enroll RCT . This double-blinded , parallel-design RCT adhere CONSORT guideline . The allocation sequence electronically generate blocked randomization ( 5 arm ; block size five ) use ensure equal group size throughout study . Research assistant blind participant ' intervention assignment participant aware receive intervention control . Parents eligible study speak read English , 5 - 17 year old child present appointment non-urgent medical issue . Data collect ( ) baseline delivery online RCT ( ii ) 1-month follow-up ass time-related change parent ' psychosocial construct ( e.g. , intention change child 's lifestyle behavior ; primary outcome ) family ' utilization resource health service facilitate healthy lifestyle behavior ( secondary outcome ) . Follow-up include email delivery survey measure identical administer baseline . Given rate attrition tend increase time parent ' access online personalize report serve proxy participation online survey complete . Continuous variable describe univariate summary ; frequency distribution determine categorical variable . Participant characteristic ( e.g. , weight status , child sex ) examine assess equivalence intervention group baseline , attrition tendency across sub-groups examine use two-way ANOVA . Multilevel model used assess intra- inter-level individual group change primary secondary outcome ; form analysis appropriate observation nest within group and/or multiple time point . Estimates effect size base percent change primary outcome . Significance p &lt; 0.05 . Significance &amp; Future Directions . The SBIRT design encourage self-management provide family tailor feedback link appropriate relevant resource facilitate child 's healthy lifestyle behavior . Findings study inform future intervention refinement implementation everyday clinical practice .</detailed_description>
