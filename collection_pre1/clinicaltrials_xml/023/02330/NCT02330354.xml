	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate effect 7-month social marketing intervention - Healthy Me , Healthy We ( previously call Our Year Healthy Living ) - improve preschool child 's ( 3-4 year ) diet physical activity behavior . The study use two-arm , cluster randomize controlled design sample 90 child care center 810 child ( 9 parent-child dyads/center ) . For study , investigator recruit 90 child care center mix urban/suburban rural area . Potential child care center county identify use online database license child care facility maintain North Carolina ( NC ) Division Child Development Early Education . State local community partner engage help inform center target county study . Direct recruitment center employ variety strategy ( e.g. , mail , email , telephone , in-person contact ) . Once center express interest , investigator work center director recruit nine parent-child dyad five teacher 3- 4-year old classroom . Outcome Measures : A series measurement collect participate child , parent , child care provider two time point - baseline follow-up . Primary outcome measure assess child physical activity diet quality . Secondary outcome measure assess child weight , center home environment . These measure collect large part two-day on-site visit child care center , supplement self-administered survey . Center visit conduct data collector undergo extensive training certification measurement procedure blind study-arm assignment . Identical data collection protocol use baseline follow-up . Children 's physical activity measure use accelerometer . A data collector fit participate child accelerometer belt morning first day center visit . The child wear accelerometer seven full day - child care home . Once data download , age-appropriate cut-points apply order calculate daily minute non-sedentary physical activity . Children 's dietary intake measure use combination direct observation food diary . The Dietary Observation Child Care ( DOCC ) , ( Ward et al . 2008 ) use assess food consume child child care . Each data collector ass three child time ; therefore , team three data collector assign center allow observation nine participate child . They observe intake two consecutive weekday , record food beverage consume child breakfast/morning snack , lunch , afternoon snack . Food diary complete parent use assess child 's dietary intake outside child care . Parents complete diary record two weekday ( coincide center visit ) one weekend day . The diary prompt parent record food consume , portion size , location , time meal snack . Follow-up phone call conduct need fill miss detail . The combined DOCC diary data analyze Nutrition Data System Research ( NDSR ) software order calculate child 's daily intake food group , calorie , nutrient . Healthy Eating Index-2005 ( HEI-2010 ) score calculate child data . Children 's height weight measurement collect trained data collector center site visit . This data ( along parent-reported child age sex ) use calculate child 's BMI , BMI percentile , BMI z-score use standard reference data provide Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC 2010 ) . The food physical activity environment home child care center assess use Home Self-administered Tool Environmental assessment Activity Diet ( HomeSTEAD ) ( Hales 2014 ) Environment Policy Assessment Observation ( EPAO ) ( Ward 2008 ) . HomeSTEAD self-administered survey assess characteristic home environment influence child 's diet physical activity behavior . The EPAO observation protocol provide similar data food physical activity environment child care center . EPAO observation complete center visit train certify data collector . Data HomeSTEAD EPAO use calculate score home center nutrition physical activity environment . Parents child care provider also ask complete brief demographic survey health behavior screener . Demographic survey assess standard characteristic like gender , age , race/ethnicity , marital status , household income , employment . Center director also complete demographic survey center ' current star rating , acceptance child care subsidy , participation federally-funded Child Adult Care Food Program ( CACFP ) , number , age , race/ethnicity child enrol . Given intervention target parent ' child care provider ' health behavior , investigator also collect self-reported data provider parent diet ( fruit , vegetable , sweeten beverage intake ) , physical activity ( frequency , amount time spend physical activity ) , health status ( weight height ) , use several health behavior screener . Once baseline measure collect , center randomly assign ( 1:1 ) intervention control arm . Centers intervention arm immediately start implementation Healthy Me , Healthy We . Centers control arm receive intervention year later ( delay ) . Program Details/Intervention : The program implement center-wide ( available 3-4 year old child parents/families child care center intervention arm , regardless participation measurement ) . The campaign begin October end April school year . At start program center director notify parent program hold kick-off event . Following kick-off , center implement four unit use material provide research team . Each unit last six week , include nutrition physical activity theme , incorporate visual cue , educational material , activity deliver target message . Campaign component target child care center home , two important sphere influence shape young child 's diet physical activity behavior ( Skouteris et al . 2011 ; Larsen et al . 2011 ) . Engaging sphere coordinate effort help ensure child receive consistent health message . Messages address promotion support child 's healthy diet physical activity behavior , also encourage child care staff parent adopt similar health behavior . The message within unit inform conceptual model address follow construct : knowledge current recommendation child adult , strategy shape physical social environment promote good eating physical activity habit , strategy overcome common barrier healthy eating physical activity , target make gradual behavior change . There three key component program . First , commitment provider , parent child , call `` Healthy We Promise . '' The provider , parent child ask promise take `` try '' approach healthy food physical activity . Each family receive copy sign keep home provider give Healthy We Promise Poster child sign display classroom . The second component classroom activity . A Unit Poster Activity Cue Cards provide facilitate activity . The Unit Poster display classroom visual reminder child overall goal current unit . Activity Cue Cards ( 12-16 card ) match Unit Poster give provider . Each week , provider select two card lead classroom activity describe . The third component help connect classroom home . A Healthy We Family Guide Activity Tracker go home child first week unit . The Family Guide several component 1 ) introduction unit theme , 2 ) Unit Guide tailor at-home opportunity , 3 ) at-home version activity complete classroom , 4 ) two three recipe try home , 5 ) expert tip health wellness . The Activity Tracker design place display child 's home allow track complete take-home activity . Throughout unit , `` Our Turn Tokens '' send home whenever provider complete Activity Cue Card classroom . The Our Turn Token intend trigger parent try at-home version classroom activity . At end school year , center host fun-festive gathering celebrate provider , parent , child accomplish year . The event include healthy food fun , active game entire family . Analysis : Intervention impact child 's physical activity ( i.e . minute non-sedentary physical activity ) diet quality ( i.e . HEI score ) assess compare difference mean change pre- post-intervention intervention control arm use two-sided t-tests adjust cluster . Our primary analysis involve test hypothesis intent-to-treat ( ITT ) principle ( see section miss data ) use Generalized Linear Mixed Models ( GLMM ) account correlation induce cluster parent child within childcare center . Each GLMM ( see ) include random intercept childcare center ( b0 ) fix effect baseline value primary outcome ( β1 ) intervention ( β2 ) test difference mean change primary outcome zero , β0 fix intercept , e error . Change Primary Outcome9m = β 0 + β1 Primary Outcomebaseline + β2 Intervention + b0 + e To explore effect intervention , investigator fit GLMMs : 1 ) adjust baseline covariates interest , consider priori , relevant change minute non-sedentary activity HEI score ; 2 ) adjust baseline variable distribute differently intervention group ; 3 ) test interaction term treatment group covariates ; 4 ) examine completers . Similar analysis use examine change child BMI , healthy weight attainment maintenance , change score HomeSTEAD EPAO . Demographic health behavior data child care center , provider , parent , child analyze descriptively , use frequency , percentage , mean , standard deviation . In addition , investigator include data covariates GLMM model . In alignment RE-AIM ( Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance ) ( Glasgow et al . 1999 ) , process evaluation plan include assessment reach , effectiveness , adoption , implementation , maintenance . These process measure allow fuller understanding study result , program improve , potential dissemination sustainability .</detailed_description>
