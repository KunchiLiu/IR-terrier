	<brief_summary>Lower urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) represent widespread health problem negatively affect quality life ( QoL ) majority male age population . Although LUTS life threatening , symptom include urinary retention , void difficulty , frequent feeling urinary urgency , nocturia , negatively affect daily function , sleep quality , sexual activity patient . Despite proven effectiveness conventional pharmacological therapy , men reluctant try treatment perceive side effect potential complication . Other non-invasive complementary treatment LUTS explore limitation pharmacological therapy . Auriculotherapy ( AT ) , one approach traditional Chinese medicine , therapeutic method specific point auricle stimulate treat various physical disorder . AT specialized form acupuncture ear view microsystem body . A minimally invasive measure AT , instead use needle , adopt study avoid pain induction . This randomize control trial ( RCT ) aim determine effectiveness AT improve condition elderly LUTS term symptom relief , enhance QoL , improve sleep condition . Male subject , 60 year old moderate severe LUTS , recruit . Subjects 'Treatment arm 1 ' receive MAT placebo LA specific auricular point one side ear treatment session . Subjects 'Treatment arm 2 ' receive LA placebo MAT use low-energy laser apply select acupoints ear , plaster centre portion Junci Medulla mimic MAT treatment also give . Subjects 'Treatment arm 3 ' receive combine approach ( MAT LA ) . Subjects 'placebo arm ' serve placebo control . Six auricular acupoints consider affect LUTS select . Only one ear time receive treatment . Thus , ear treat alternately . The total treatment period four week . The experimental object replace every day . Therefore , treatment perform thrice week . Subjects assess baseline 3 month therapy . This study advance knowledge complementary approach improve LUTS condition elderly population feasibility AT among client LUTS future large-scale study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research hypothesis : 1 . Magneto-auriculotherapy ( MAT ) laser auriculotherapy ( LA ) alone use combination effective control treatment term symptom relief male elderly patient suffer LUTS . 2 . MAT LA alone use combination effective control treatment term enhancement QoL , improvement sleep condition male elderly patient suffer LUTS . Primary objective To investigate whether MAT combination LAT effective control treatment term symptom relief male elderly patient suffer LUTS . Secondary objectives 1 . To determine whether MAT combination LAT effective control treatment term enhancement QoL , improvement sleep condition male elderly patient suffer LUTS ; 2 . To assess feasibility use AT among LUTS patient future large-scale study , include use blinding , acceptance treatment protocol , follow-up repetitive testing , estimate effect size attrition rate . 3 . To compare treatment effect feasibility study conduct Hong Kong China Mainland . Research plan methodology Design : This study randomize control double-blinded feasibility trial . Participants setting . In Hong Kong : Subjects 60 year old recruit community centre day care centre . The therapy administer either Integrative Health Clinic School Nursing , The Hong Kong Polytechnic University , elderly centre , depend subject ' convenience . In China : Subjects recruit Nursing College Zhengzhou University . The inclusion exclusion , therapy administration , outcome measure identical study conduct Hong Kong facilitate comparison . All therapy administer room assign research purpose . Only researcher subject treatment allow stay room therapy . A warning sign laser radiation put visible place outside room worker member elderly centre see . Groupings Group 1 ( MAT &amp; placebo LAT ) : Subjects receive MAT . The magnetic pellet ~200 gauss/pellet magnetic flux density average , diameter 1.76 mm ( Figure 1 ) . The experimental object apply six select acupoints detect acupoint finder . The Chinese Standard Ear-Acupoints Chart , recognize World Health Organization , use locate reflective zone . These zone follow : angle superior concha/prostate , kidney , bladder , ureter , external genitals , internal genitals ( Wang , Ceng , Wang , Lin &amp; Wang , 1999 ) . To achieve blind placebo effect subject , laser device switch `` power '' mode ( i.e . deactivate laser ) acupoint `` stimulation '' application MAT . Subjects ask wear pair laser protective goggles `` blind '' treatment . Group 2 ( Combined MAT &amp; LAT ) : Subjects receive combine approach include use MAT LA . A laser device ( Pointer Pulseâ„¢ ) use study . This device wavelength 650 nm , average output power 2.5 mW , energy density 1 minute 0.54 J/cm2 , pulse 10 Hz , common acceptable dosage clinical use ( King et al. , 1990 ; Round et al. , 2013 ) . This application low-energy laser therapy ( LLLT ) , energy level emit device approximately comparable teach pointer . A 1-minute treatment use continuous mode device directly apply reactive region six select acupoints ear . Laser protective goggles provide subject researcher eye protection ( Figure 2 ) . Group 3 ( Placebo MAT &amp; placebo LAT ) : Subjects serve placebo control receive LAT `` power '' mode ( i.e . deactivate laser ) acupoint `` stimulation '' application plaster centre small portion Junci Medulla ( mimic MAT treatment ) . Junci Medulla dry stem perennial plant soft texture . It successfully adopt placebo previous study conduct PI induce physical pressure acupoints ear ( Suen et al. , 2002a ) . Experimental control intervention Eligible subject randomly blindly allocate one three group , decide computer-generated randomised table . Restricted randomisation block use ensure approximately similar sample size group time trial accord equal proportion rule ( 1:1:1 ) . The random allocation sequence manage specify research assistant ( RA ) involve trial conceal assessor .</detailed_description>
