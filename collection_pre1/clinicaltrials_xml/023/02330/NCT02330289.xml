	<detailed_description>Past research show 25 % diagnostic test duplicative limit value . Academic medical center employ physicians-in-training may find particularly challenge reduce low value test due historical emphasis extensive workups trainee . Despite increased emphasis cost-consciousness medical education , little exist research evaluate way optimize order behavior physicians-in-training . This study evaluate normative feedback intervention internal medicine physicians-in-training reduce overuse routine laboratory test hospitalize patient . Physicians-in-training cluster-randomized two arm : ( 1 ) receive report card ( intervention group ) , ( 2 ) receive report card ( control group ) . We study use routine laboratory test pre-intervention period 1 week post-randomization period 1 week . We study physician attitude real-time feedback dashboard qualitative assessment focus group completion intervention .</detailed_description>
