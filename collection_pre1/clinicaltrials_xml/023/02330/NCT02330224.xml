	<brief_summary>High blood pressure ( BP ) serious public health problem responsible heart attack , stroke kidney failure . One four adult Singapore hypertension . We propose pilot study 2 polyclinics Singapore , 1 deliver structure multi-component intervention another usual care . A total 100 adult uncontrolled high blood pressure follow 3 month . The intervention include 1 ) algorithm-driven antihypertensive treatment patient use fixed-dose combination lipid lower high risk patient , 2 ) motivational conversation high risk patient ; 3 ) telephone base follow-ups patient team physician supervise nurse practitioner nurse . The change BP compare intervention control group . The structured care include mention component likely effective usual care lower BP level patient uncontrolled high blood pressure . Such program also likely cost effective term money spend improve quality patient ' life . The finding pilot inform design large cluster randomize trial eight polyclinics Singapore . If main study successful , finding informative policymakers roll intervention polyclinics primary care center across Singapore , country similar healthcare infrastructure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Background : Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause disability death Singapore , consume substantial healthcare resource . Uncontrolled hypertension confers high attributable risk CVD . About one four adult suffer hypertension Singapore , 50 % uncontrolled blood pressure ( BP ) , management especially sub-optimal among concomitant diabetes dyslipidemia . Evidence suggest well structure program care delivery effective lowering BP prevent CVD . However , lack empirical data strategy Singapore . The finding pilot inform design large cluster randomize trial eight polyclinics Singapore . If proven effective main study , information valuable convince policy-makers upscale strategy enhance management hypertension cardiovascular health within primary health infrastructure Singapore , possibly neighbour Southeast Asian country . 2 . Aims : Specific aim 1 : To explore logistics delivery provider training intervention algorithm motivational counsel maintain optimal efficiency ongoing clinical work polyclinics . Specific aim 2 : To establish recruitment participant intervention usual care group , uptake component multicomponent intervention . Specific aim 3 : To establish mechanism capture retrieval relevant clinic visit data ( physician nurse record , pharmacy laboratory include cost ) polyclinic , telephone follow-up , hospitalization related cost . Specific aim 4 : To explore impact intervention v usual care change BP short term . Specific aim 5 : Identify appropriate method capture potential adverse event safety endpoint relate intervention . 3 . Study Design : It non-randomized community intervention trial design test feasibility structure multi-component intervention polyclinic setting . 4 . Setting : The study involve two polyclinics Singapore . One deliver intervention one deliver usual care . 5 . Study population : The polyclinics system place patient hypertension get `` panel '' fast blood urine test subsidize cost time initial diagnosis annually . The individual visit polyclinic initial ( annual ) panel laboratory test mark `` hypertension panel '' screen eligibility recruit eligible . One hundred patient ( 50 per polyclinic ) recruit follow 3 month . 6 . Intervention : Orientation training session organize physician , nurse practitioner ( NP ) nurse polyclinic assign intervention comprise 3 component 1 . Structured treatment algorithm fix dose antihypertensive high risk patient : The training curriculum include treatment algorithm prepare team nephrologists , cardiologist pharmacologist consultation primary care physicians Clinical Cardiovascular Work Group , use case method , aim global cardiovascular risk reduction . 2 . Motivational conversation NPs nurse high risk patient baseline : Separate training session conduct NP nurse . NP nurse receive train motivational conversation technique communication strategy trainer skilled communication health care . These nurse nurse practitioner provide motivational conversation session high CVD risk patient baseline . 3 . Structured follow-up telephone Clinics : NPs nurse intervention polyclinic proactive follow-up patient self-monitoring BP provide advice adherence treatment every 4 week duration project ( 3 month ) . A communication checklist follow-up incorporated exist follow-up system . Information adverse event obtain action plan communicate patient ( discontinue suspect drug arrange visit clinic , appropriate ) . 7 . Usual Care : The health provider polyclinic usual care continue exist practice . 8 . Outcomes assessment : Final outcome assessment take place three month baseline . The outcomes assessor also call patient telephone outcomes assessment week 6 baseline . Information self-monitoring BP , recommend life style change , self-care , medication use ( include herbal traditional Chinese ) collect . The outcome assessor also extract process outcome measure general practitioner ( GP ) nurse ' note . These include number duration contact patient ( whether person phone ) , change prescribe medication dose , report adverse event medication . 9 . Sample size calculation : Sample size calculate use Stata version 12 . A sample size 90 ( 45 group ) achieve 80 % power detect 5 mmHg difference systolic BP change baseline end follow-up intervention group compare usual care group , estimate standard deviation ( SD ) 9.5 , significance level 0.05 use two-sided two-sample t-test . Assuming could 10 % drop rate , plan take total sample size 100 subject . At least 152 eligible subject ( 72 group ) would necessary attain least 66 % recruitment rate .</detailed_description>
