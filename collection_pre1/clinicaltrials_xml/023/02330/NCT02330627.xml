	<brief_title>Positive Valence System Enhancement Treatment Anxiety Depression : Clinical Efficacy Neural Changes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment approach anxiety depression emphasize reduction negative emotion distress central goal treatment . However , condition also characterize low level positive emotion , , although fundamental life satisfaction well-being , traditionally focus treatment . The propose project aim test efficacy integrate treatment regimen design modulate functioning core component process positive emotion system . Specifically , implement positive emotion enhancement procedure , previously test validated non-clinical sample ( Huffman et al. , 2011 ; Lyubomirsky et al. , 2005 ) , broad community sample n=30 individual seek treatment anxiety depression . Participants randomly assign multi-session positive valence system target treatment ( n=15 ) waitlist control group ( n=15 ) . Participants assess baseline post-treatment compare measure positive negative emotion , brain response reward punishment/loss , subjective well-being , symptom . Aim 1 test hypothesis participant assign positive emotion enhancement intervention display great increase positive affect enhance activity neural system regulate response reward ( e.g. , nucleus accumbens ) relative participant waitlist control group . Aim 2 explore whether effect positive emotion system treatment generalize parallel measure negative emotion system ( i.e. , negative affect neural reactivity aversive outcome ) . We also explore effect intervention subjective well-being life satisfaction , examine relationship change subjective emotion neural index positive negative valence function change well-being life satisfaction .</detailed_description>
