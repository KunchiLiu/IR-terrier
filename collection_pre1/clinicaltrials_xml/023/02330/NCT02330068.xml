	<brief_title>Microbiome Depression &amp; Treatment Response Citalopram</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct Mayo Clinic Jacksonville Department Psychiatry ( recruit 10 patient 10 control pair data ) Mayo Clinic Depression Center Rochester ( recruit 30 patient 30 control pair data ) . Patients major depression confirm structured diagnostic interview ( SCID ) moderate symptom severity ( Quick Inventory Depressive Symptomatology S-C16 ) enrol 12 week study . We explore gut microbiome ( genetic material ) gut-brain marker inflammation ( cortisol , cytokine ) stool specimen serum sample , respectively . Collections baseline , week 2 , week 12 study . Healthy control matched age , sex ( include menopausal status female subject ) , body-mass index ( BMI ) baseline stool serum collection . Statistical t-tests use assess baseline difference patient control microbiome inflammatory marker . Treatment response ( 50 % reduction QIDS ) , treatment remission ( QIDS-C16 &lt; 6 ) analyze change microbiome inflammation marker . Correlational analysis multiple test correction conduct depression symptom severity measure cortisol , cytokine , gut microbiome composition . This study focus early translation Dr. Fryer Dr. Chia 's research bring gut-brain interface field individualize treatment patient struggle depression . This project provide insight gut microbiota may implicate depression , antidepressant treatment alter microbiota composition , factor impact key physiologic mediator depression ( i.e . cortisol cytokine level ) . The public health implication focus drug development treatment depression substantial .</detailed_description>
