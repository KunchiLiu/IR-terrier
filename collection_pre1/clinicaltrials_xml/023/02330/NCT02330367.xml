	<brief_summary>AC0010 novel , potent , small molecule irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) selectively target mutant form epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) spar wild-type ( WT ) EGFR . The purpose study evaluate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) safety profile oral AC0010 ; determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) oral AC0010 ; assess safety efficacy AC0010 previously treat mutant EGFR NSCLC patient EGFR T790M mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety , Pharmacokinetic Preliminary Efficacy Study AC0010 Patients With EGFR T790M Positive NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer remain common cancer worldwide non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account 85 % case . Molecularly targeted therapy prove superior chemotherapy NSCLC patient whose tumor mutation EGFR . Recent study establish tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) gold standard treat EGFR-mutation-positive NCSLC . However , patient TKIs eventually progress , approximately 50 % case , progression due development additional mutation call T790M . AC0010 may provide effective therapy patient population alternative treatment option . Pre-clinical data demonstrate AC0010 inhibits T790M . It anticipate AC0010 may promote cell death tumor cell T790M mutation , thus provide possible therapeutic benefit patient develop T790M-mediated resistance previous TKIs . This two-part , open-label study oral AC0010 administer twice-daily previously treat NSCLC patient document evidence activate mutation EGFR gene fail treatment EGFR inhibitor erlotinib , gefitinib afatinib . This study include 2 part : Stage 1 : Dose-escalation Period 28-day cycle ; Optional Treatment Extension Period start Day 29 Stage 2 : Evaluation activity safety patient EGFR T790M mutation</detailed_description>
