	<brief_summary>The primary aim phase I/II , randomize , placebo control study assessment safety tolerability universal donor FMT compare placebo pediatric young adult subject ( age 5 year 30 year ) active ulcerative colitis ( UC ) previously fail traditional , first-line maintenance therapy ( aminosalicylates ) intolerant therapy . Secondary objective include identification biomarkers donor recipient may confer clinical response establish whether ongoing FMT maintenance therapy require maintenance clinical benefit pediatric UC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fecal Microbiota Transplant ( FMT ) Pediatric Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , phase I/II , randomize , prospective , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study FMT treatment active pediatric UC . The primary aim ass safety feasibility weekly FMT maintenance therapy . A total 60 patient active UC ( define PUCAI score &gt; 9 ) enrol randomized receive FMT placebo-FMT ( study treatment ) retention enema 1 week oral , frozen encapsulate inocula/placebo 7 week . After first 8 week , subject FMT improve subject placebo-FMT improve option continue study treatment switch open-label FMT end 6 month study initiation . Subjects follow telephone ass adverse event total 6 month last FMT dose . An initial subset 10 subject enrol randomized receive FMT placebo . We 'd expect short term adverse event occur within 7 day FMT administration . Subject safety data review completely 7 day subject receive least 2 dos study drug prior continue enrollment open label use FMT . Patient metadata stool sample collect key time point . The patient-reported metadata collection technique allow numerous clinical correlation parse use random forest machine learn capability synthetic learn microbial ecology ( SLiME ) identify taxonomic feature associate important clinical parameter .</detailed_description>
