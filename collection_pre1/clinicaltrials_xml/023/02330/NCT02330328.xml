	<brief_summary>This randomize control , multi-center , non-blinded non-inferiority study examine utility telemetry monitoring patient admit low risk acute coronary syndrome . Each six site prospectively enroll 250 patient arm study randomize either med-surg bed ( telemetry ) telemetry bed admission . Research study coordinator enroll patient follow throughout hospital course record primary secondary end point event . The research coordinator collect information follow item data collection : age , gender , smoke history , history hypertension , history diabetes mellitus , history hypercholesterolemia , history family member early heart disease myocardial infarction , body mass index . Research coordinator document patient follow event hospital course : death , myocardial infarction ( MI ) , upgrade high level care , dysrhythmia , result stress test cardiac catheterization . In addition patient contact 30 day 365 day inquire MI , need percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , revascularization ( CABG ) . Based previous study , hypothesize patient age 18-49 year low risk Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) unlikely benefit continuous heart monitoring admit hospital chest pain . We suspect rate significant event may approach zero group participant . This study aim show bed without remote monitoring- telemetry- adequate low risk participant chest pain hospitalize .</brief_summary>
