	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) highly prevalent , chronic disable condition substantial morbidity mortality . Depression currently fourth lead cause global burden disease ( DALYs ) disability worldwide , expect second 20201 . Around one eight people Canada develop depression lifetime , total cost Canadian economy estimate $ 51 billion per year2 . The cost treat MDD high part due limitation effectiveness antidepressant treatment . Approximately 60 % patient fail remit first antidepressant prescribed3 subsequent selection antidepressant remain matter trial error . Using trial error approach , may take year find successful treatment patient4,5 . The protracted ineffective treatment result prolong suffering , substantial morbidity , loss productivity increase burden patient 's family . Brain-based biomarkers could assist predict clinical response treatment intervention tailor treatment individual patient . The result previous neuroimaging study examine brain marker treatment response derive group average 6 , -9 limit predictive value individual level . Another limitation study predictor derive pretreatment baseline brain scan could influence many personal ( personality , childhood trauma , genotype ) clinical ( course , duration illness , episode , symptom cluster , severity symptom past medication exposure ) characteristic may limit generalizability . On hand , grow evidence early clinical response within 2 week antidepressant treatment EEG change first week treatment predict later outcomes . Furthermore , early treatment change brain function may provide crucial information brain 's capacity change treatment interactive effect personal/ clinical characteristic pharmacological factor , may help differential prediction treatment responses two antidepressant . Hence , examine predictive value dynamic brain change first two week treatment individual patient would improve statistical reliability predictive accuracy minimize confound effect inherent pretreatment scan . In study , propose investigate predictive value rest state task relate fMRI data collect pretreatment baseline 2 week treatment predict remitters non-remitters desvenlafaxine antidepressant treatment week 12 use machine learn classifier . Desvenlafaxine serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRI ) proven efficacy , safety easy administer single daily dose . It limit sedative cognitive side effect drowsiness , lack alertness poor attention , may confound early brain change treatment . This study provide brain-based predictive biomarkers test prospectively clinical trial eventually clinical practice accuracy . Machine Learning Classification ( Support Vector Machine ) : The support vector machine ( SVM ) computer base analytical technique design high dimensional biological data fMRI data provide best classification individual observation distinct group 38 . Diagnostic classification ( depression diagnosis healthy control ) classification treatment responsiveness ( responder non-responders ) examine clinical population fMRI data use SVM 39-41 . This technique consist two phase : training phase test phase . During train phase SVM train develop decision function hyperplane separate data two group accord class label . In test phase , decision function use predict class label new subject responder non-responder . The accuracy prediction SVM depend specificity ( identification true negative ) sensitivity ( identification true positive ) . In recent year neuroimaging study employ SVM structural functional MRI data order predict MDD patient improved treatment . Fu et al ( 2008 ) show apply SVM emotional task-related fMRI data , 62 % patient achieve remission ( sensitivity ) 75 % patient achieve remission ( specificity ) follow 8 week fluoxetine treatment could predict . But result statistically significant due small sample size ( remitters =8 , non-remitters=10 ) . Similarly , Costafreda et al ( 2009 ) apply SVM pretreatment structural scan show prediction sensitivity 88.9 % specificity 88.9 % accuracy 88.9 % small sample comprise 18 patient 40 . In recent study involve 61 MDD patient , SVM analysis pretreatment white matter data predict clinical outcome refractory non- refractory depression accuracy 65.22 % , sensitivity 56.2 % specificity 73.91 % 41 . Although result later study statistically significant , low sensitivity accuracy may limit clinical use . Moreover , structural imaging may useful examine predictive value early treatment change brain function . In summary , study , date apply SVM functional data generate large sample use evaluate predictive accuracy individual level . Main objective : Using machine learn method examine predictive value ( sensitivity , specificity , accuracy ) rest state emotional task-related fMRI data collect pretreatment time ( week 0 ) early phase antidepressant treatment ( week 2 ) classification remitters non-remitters patient MDD 12 week treatment . Secondary objective : To compare predictive value pretreatment baseline brain activity ( week 0 ) early treatment brain activity ( week 2 ) . Primary hypothesis : By employ machine learn method pretreatment 2 week post-treatment fMRI data , hypothesize possible predict significant accuracy whether individual patient MDD could classify remitter non-remitter end 12 week antidepressant treatment . Secondary hypothesis ( Exploratory ) : Based previous EEG study preliminary data standard group comparison show early treatment response associate brain change , hypothesize prediction antidepressant treatment outcome individual level , good use fMRI data obtain early treatment ( 2 week ) compare pretreatment fMRI data . Rationale : The current study design evaluate predictive value early brain change relate antidepressant treatment classify remitters non-remitters base clinical response 12 week treatment . Traditionally , neuroimaging study use group comparison pretreatment scan treatment outcome prediction , limited clinical value make prediction individual level . Machine learn method provide prediction individual level , prospectively use clinical practice . As meta-analysis clinical trial indicate early clinical response reliable predictor later treatment outcome11,12 , study examine brain scan pretreatment early post-treatment ( 2 week ) time . Experimental Design Procedure : The eligible patient MDD enter single blind placebo treatment two week . At end two week placebo treatment , participant consider placebo responder base improvement depression symptom measure MADRS scale ( &gt; 50 % decrease MADRS score baseline ) . The placebo responder exclude study . The end two week placebo treatment consider week 0 active treatment . The placebo non-responders remain eligible score 22 high MADRS receive desvenlafaxine 50mg/day 14 day dosage increase 100 mg /day day 15 patient improve 20 % reduction MADRS score dosage determine day 15 maintain end 12 week . The first fMRI session perform week 0 ( pretreatment baseline ) second session perform end week 2 ( 14 th day ) . The participant assess clinically week 1,2,4,6,8,10 12 use MADRS , 17-item Hamilton Depression ( HAM-D ) rating Scale46 , Hamilton anxiety ( HAM-A ) rating scale47 clinical global impression severity illness scale ( CGI-S ) clinical global impression-improvement scale ( CGI-I ) 48 . HAM-A ( Hamilton 1959 ) use rate anxiety symptom . To evaluate overall clinical improvement , CGI-S CGI-I give . Quality life measure ( Q-LES-Q ) 49 give baseline ( week 0 ) week 12 . Adverse effect record visit . MADRS score week 12 use determine remitters non-remitters . Patients score less 10 MADRS week 12 consider remitters 50. fMRI Scanning Methods The first fMRI session perform week 0 ( pretreatment baseline ) second session perform end week 2 . Images collect use Discovery MR750 3T MRI system ( GE Healthcare , Waukesha , WI , USA ) Seaman Family MRI Research Centre Foothills Hospital , Calgary . Anatomical image include 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE image ( TR=9.2ms ; TE= minimum ; flip angle=20 ; FOV=25.6 cm ; voxel size=1mm3 . Resting state consist 5-min resting-state scan participant ask keep eye close hold still ( TR=2000ms ; TE=30ms ; flip angle=75 degree ; FOV=24 cm ; matrix size =64x64 , number slices=36 ; slice thickness=4mm ) Two additional functional MRI scan also collect participant perform emotional stroop task ( block design ) use acquisition parameter describe fMRI resting scan . Machine learn Analysis We use support vector machine ( SVMs ) , successfully apply predict treatment outcome MDD fMRI data . After preprocessing , SVM implement PROBID software package ( http : //www.brain.map.co.uk/probid.htm ) use investigate accuracy whole brain rest task-related Blood Oxygen Level Dependent ( BOLD ) data predict response antidepressant treatment . Individual brain scan treat point locate high dimensional space define BOLD response value preprocessed image . During train phase , linear decision boundary high dimensional space define `` hyperplane '' separate individual scan accord class label . SVM classifier train provide example form &lt; X , C &gt; X represent fMRI data C represent class label ( C= 1 remitters , C = -1 non-remitters ) . Once hyperplane determine training data , use predict class label test sample . A linear kernel SVM use extract weight sector image ( SVM discriminate map ) . A `` leave-one-out '' cross validation method use validate classifier . This procedure involve exclude single subject group classifier train use remain subject . The subject pair exclude used test ability classifier distinguish remitters non-remitters . The procedure repeat subject pair sample order ass overall accuracy SVM . To establish whether classification accuracy statistically significant , perform permutation test . This involve repeat classification procedure 1000 time random permutation train group label count number permutation achieve high sensitivity specificity one observe true label . The p value calculate divide number 1000 . Bonferroni correction false discovery rate use correct multiple testing . This SVM analysis permutation test perform pretreatment scan 2-week post-treatment scan separately . The task-related data rest state data analyze separately . Sample size calculation The sample size calculation classification study base precision want achieve sensitivity specificity . The precision refers width 95 % confidence interval associate estimate . To achieve 95 % confidence interval plus minus 0.16 85 % sensitivity 85 % specificity , need total sample 40 subject . Having sample size 40 achieve statistically significant classification accuracy clinically meaningful sensitivity specificity . Accounting placebo response 30 % drop 10 % , need recruit total 61 subject sample 40 .</detailed_description>
