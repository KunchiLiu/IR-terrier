	<brief_summary>This Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluate new combination drug , marizomib ( MRZ ) bevacizumab ( BEV ; Avastin® ) , treatment WHO Grade IV malignant glioma . The study population include subject first second relapse previously receive bevacizumab anti-angiogenic agent proteasome inhibitor treatment malignant glioma . Phase 1 evaluates combination MRZ BEV , Phase 2 evaluate single-agent MRZ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stage 1 : Marizomib + Bevacizumab WHO Gr IV GBM ; Stage 2 : Marizomib Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One treatment option currently FDA approve recurrent WHO Grade IV malignant glioma BEV . Additional treatment option need subject . Published literature indicate target proteasome glioma cell show significant anti-tumor activity . MRZ novel , second generation proteasome inhibitor prevents breakdown protein involve signal transduction block growth survival cancer cell . In-vitro study multiple glioma cell line highly sensitive MRZ . MRZ relatively little effect neural stem/progenitor cell suggest minimal neurotoxicity significantly affect malignant glioma stem cell glioma cell line . Phase 1 trial complete Recommended Phase 2 Dose ( RP2D ) establish 0.8 mg/m2 . Phase 2 trial enrol MRZ RP2D determine Phase 1 assess single-agent activity safety .</detailed_description>
