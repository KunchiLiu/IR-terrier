	<detailed_description>Therapies target VEGF mTOR signal pathway represent standard first-line second-line treatment option patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . There standard treatment patient renal cell carcinoma previously treat VEGF target therapy mTOR inhibitors.To best investigator knowledge , GOLD study first phase 3 trial third-line set VEGF-inhibitor mTOR-inhibitor drugs.From study , Sorafenib may option third-line treatment.The Best trial demonstrate Bevacizumab/sorafenib best efficacy advance renal cancer canrcinoma VEGF/VEGFR co-inhibition strategy may warrant investigation possibly selective VEGFR inhibitors.So investigator conduct randomized , open-label , multi-center phase II study compare bevacizumab plus sorafenib versus sorafenib third-line treatment patient Metastatic renal cell carcinoma .</detailed_description>
