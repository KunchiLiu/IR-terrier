	<brief_summary>Cancer cachexia multi-factorial syndrome define ongoing loss skeletal muscle mass ( without loss fat mass ) fully reverse conventional nutritional support lead progressive functional impairment . There urgency improve management , consensus optimal treatment cancer cachexia . Several single therapy cancer cachexia examine clinical trial , disappoint overall result . As multiple factor responsible development cachexia , argue optimal cachexia intervention target component : multimodal therapy multimodal problem . The overall aim study early prevent development cachexia rather treatment late disease trajectory . From patient perspective short term effect improve physical psychological function , reduce symptom burden improve survival . In word live long well life chemotherapy . Direct effect cachexia intervention expect reduction weight muscle loss , improved physical activity quality life .</brief_summary>
