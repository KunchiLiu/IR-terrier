	<brief_title>An RCT Comparing Xenograft Allograft Ridge Preservation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Buccal bony wall loss common sequela follow tooth extraction , guide bone regeneration ( GBR ) common treatment regeneration ridge form volume preservation allow dental implant placement . Many bone augmentation biomaterials employ accomplish GBR , medical/ dental community , subsequently , patient benefit understanding whether give GBR biomaterial might efficacious . To end , randomize , case series comparison allograft + x-linked collagen membrane versus xenograft + non-x-linked collagen membrane would beneficial dental community patient . The study compare effectiveness demineralize freeze-dried bone allograft + x-linked collagen membrane xenograft + non-x-linked collagen membrane posterior region extraction socket ridge preservation .</detailed_description>
