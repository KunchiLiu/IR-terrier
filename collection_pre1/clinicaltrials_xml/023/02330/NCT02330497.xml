	<brief_summary>Advances conventional imaging ( abdominal ultrasound , CT scan , MRI ) great chance discover incidental solid cystic pancreatic lesion become usual . Endocrine tumor variable malignant potential depending size , malignancy lesion large 2 cm indefinite small size . The branch-duct like IPMN ( intraductal papillary mucinous pancreatic tumor ) involve pancreatic secondary duct represent half pancreatic cystic tumor may degenerate 5 10 % case . Signs risk degeneration presence mural nodule great 5 mm size &gt; 3 cm , although latter criterion discuss . Mucinous cystadenomas could degenerate 30 50 % case even though role size much discuss ( &lt; 4 cm ) . The follow-up imaging perform use MRI endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) . A fine needle aspiration cytology histology possible determination biological marker useful . But cytology often unprofitable due poor cellular profile cystic pancreatic tumor . Once diagnosis suspect malignancy , patient refer surgeon pancreatic resection less extensive . But attitude facing significant operative risk 30 % morbidity mortality 1 3 % cephalic resection . Some patient high post operative risk inoperable . For reason , team propose destruction wall cyst EUS , US CT control wash absolute alcohol content cystic tumor . An interesting alternative endoscopic destruction would use radio frequency ablation technique ( RFA ) . RFA recognize technique local tumor destruction deliver thermal energy obtain coagulation necrosis lesion . Taewong Medical ™ recently develop radiofrequency needle EUSRA® couple combo VIVA ™ generator apply RFA sub EUS control . But prospective study available date regard treatment cystic solid tumoral pancreatic lesion technique . The primary endpoint present study investigate feasibility safety guide radiofrequency probe EUS treatment pancreatic endocrine tumor inoperable pancreatic cystic tumor . The secondary objective efficiency .</brief_summary>
