	<brief_title>Walnut Ingestion Adults Risk Diabetes : Effects Body Composition , Diet Quality , Cardiac Risk Measures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims - To determine effect walnut-included diet ( without caloric intake adjustment ) versus walnut-excluded diet diet quality adult risk diabetes . Specifically , show walnut-included diet , compare walnut-excluded diet improve overall diet quality measure Alternative Healthy Eating Index adult risk diabetes . - To determine effect walnut-included diet ( without caloric intake adjustment ) versus walnut-excluded diet body composition adult risk diabetes . Specifically , show walnut-included diet , compare walnut-excluded diet 6 month improve body fat percentage adult risk diabetes . - To assess effect walnut-included diet ( without caloric intake adjustment ) 6-month period endothelial function , lipid panel level , fast glucose level , fast insulin level anthropometric measure adult risk diabetes . Specifically , show clinically meaningful improvement endothelial function , lipid panel , fast blood glucose , hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , anthropometric measure endothelial function inclusion walnuts diet adult risk diabetes . Hypotheses - A walnut-included diet without dietary counseling adjust caloric intake improve diet quality adult risk diabetes . - A walnut-included diet 6 month without dietary counseling adjust caloric intake improve body composition adult risk diabetes . - A walnut-included diet without dietary counseling adjust caloric intake improve lipid panel , fast blood glucose , hemoglobin A1c , endothelial function anthropometric measure adult risk diabetes . - Controlling calorie intake keep constant addition walnut diet enhance beneficial effect walnut ingestion diet quality , body composition , vascular function .</detailed_description>
