	<brief_summary>Pilonidal disease ( PD ) chronic disease major impact patient quality life productivity . Thus , wound heal would significant effect patient quality outcome , patient quality life , healthcare utilization , well societal benefit allow vital population return productivity . There consensus postoperative wound care surgery PD . Negative pressure therapy commonly use . However , therapy costly cumbersome , evidence-based optimize wound heal postoperative patient financial outcome . The investigator goal investigate impact MatriStem® Wound Matrix MicroMatrix® ( ACell , Inc. , Columbia , MD ) pilonidal wound heal . Secondary goal evaluate impact MatriStem Wound Matrix MicroMatrix postoperative outcome , quality life , healthcare cost surgical management pilonidal disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator study 2 main goal : Aim 1 : To evaluate wound heal 2 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month postoperatively prospective MatriStem Wound Matrix MicroMatrix cohort Aim 2 : To evaluate pilonidal recurrence , reoperation rate , healthcare utilization , quality life 2 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month postoperatively prospective MatriStem Wound Matrix MicroMatrix cohort The investigator main hypothesis use MatriStem Wound Matrix MicroMatrix postoperative wound care significantly improve heal rate , healthcare utilization , quality life outcome . The null hypothesis study significant difference heal rate , healthcare utilization , quality life outcome MatriStem Wound Matrix/ MicroMatrix negative pressure dress cohort . The alternative hypothesis difference heal rate , healthcare utilization , quality life outcome MatriStem Wound Matrix/ MicroMatrix negative pressure dress cohort . Twenty consecutive patient undergo surgical excision Pilonidal Disease recruit treatment . All patient undergo comparable surgical excision application novel protocol . The wound leave undisturbed 10-14 day ( 1st follow-up visit ) . At 1st scheduled postoperative visit , wound reassess operative suite , second application protocol may perform surgeon 's discretion . The next follow-up visit 1 month , 3 month , 6 month . At visit , wound bed measure , photo documentation capture , patient complete survey ass quality life . Study Endpoints : 1 . Wound heal 6 month . Success define 60 % heal rate epithelialization wound contracture volume measurement centimeter . 2 . Observation quality life , total cost treatment , recurrence reoperation rate 6 month</detailed_description>
