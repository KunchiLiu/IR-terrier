	<brief_summary>Approximately , 3 % male 8 % female develop urinary tract infection ( UTI ) childhood , effectively treat short-term antibiotic therapy . A subset child ( 20-48 % ) , develop recurrent UTI ( RUTI ) , may long-term effect form hypertension renal damage . In effort prevent RUTIs physicians prescribe sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim ( Septra ) nitrofurantoin low dose antibiotic prophylaxis . However , recent evidence suggest prophylactic therapy body expose antibiotic level capable increase antibiotic resistance bacterial virulence . This show true uropathogens E. coli Staphylococcus saprophyticus , yet know Enterococcus sp . demonstrate similar mechanism . Additionally , antibiotic show disrupt natural balance human microbiome , potentially lead major long term problem . As uropathogen , enterococci consistently rank top 3 cause RUTI , especially child 3 year age . Additionally , Enterococcus notorious develop antibiotic resistance study show child enterococcal UTIs exhibit high rate recurrence non-enterococcal UTIs . The investigator hypothesize current practice antibiotic prophylaxis child RUTI detrimental change bacterial sensitivity profile patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients meet inclusion criterion recruit study Dr. Dave 's discretion urology clinic . As clinically indicated patient fall one two group , patient receive antibiotic prophylaxis undergo clinical observation . This reflect standard care child receive additional procedure mandate . At initial appointment information sheet consent form give parent/caregiver consider ; due nature study , parent legal guardian require give inform consent . Following receipt inform consent , patient ask provide mid stream urine sample give infection free currently antibiotic . Patients assess simultaneously dysfunctional elimination syndrome ( DES ) review 48-hour bowel bladder diary , complete Dysfunctional Voiding Scoring System ( DVSS ) questionnaire perform uroflowmetry . Patients may withdraw study stage without repercussion . Patients antibiotic prophylaxis group receive 3-month script antibiotic prophylaxis , clinically indicate accord standard care . Septra ( Trimethoprim dose 2 mg/kg ) nitrofurantoin ( dose 2 mg/kg ) antibiotic use prophylaxis base past culture allergy history . Antibiotic prescription renew 3 month informal assessment compliance perform review number dos leave . Patients tolerate one antibiotic offer alternate . From month 6-12 , prophylaxis cease ( washout period ) unless symptomatic UTI suspect point appropriate treatment implement . Lifestyle change , behavioural modification management constipation institute group . Patients return follow visit 3 , 6 , 9 12 month . In addition , patient return urology clinic time UTI suspect . Urine sample collect baseline 3 , 6 , 9 12 month group ( prophylaxis versus observation ) register nurse Children 's Hospital , London Health Sciences Centre . Healthy patient , recent history UTI antibiotic use know urinary tract abnormality , include give indication healthy urinary microbiota paediatric population . These participant ask provide urine two time point minimum three month apart . Samples assess bacterial identification via culture dependent independent method . Antibiotic susceptibility profile determine viable organism use Kirby Bauer disk method bacterial virulence analyze via bladder kidney cell line adherence internalization assay , well PCR determine presence virulence gene associate pathogen ( adhesins , fimbria , toxin ) . Urinary cytokine analysis via Luminex also conduct measure host bladder state , immune response disease severity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient experience minimum 2 UTIs within last year , well culture prove UTI inclusion either RUTI group . Patients must deem require antibiotic prophylaxis , discretion Dr. Dave follow standard care , inclusion antibiotic prophylaxis group . Patients known urological abnormality , recent history UTI antibiotic use eligible inclusion healthy patient group . Patients abnormal urinary tract determine use ultrasound , give abnormal ultrasound , great two febrile UTIs , void cystourethrogram ( VCUG ) . The use ultrasound VCUG give indication standard care .</criteria>
