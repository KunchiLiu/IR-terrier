	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Topotecan Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Metastatic Soft Tissue Bone Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression free rate week 12 patient soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) treat pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) plus oral topotecan ( topotecan hydrochloride ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate patient STS treat combination pazopanib topotecan . II . To determine clinical benefit rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] + stable disease [ SD ] ) patient STS treat combination pazopanib topotecan . III . To determine median progression-free rate ( PFR ) patient STS treat combination pazopanib topotecan . IV . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) patient STS treat combination pazopanib topotecan . V. To assess safety tolerability patient treat combination pazopanib topotecan . VI . To estimate PFR patient osteosarcoma treat combination pazopanib topotecan . VII . To estimate PFR patient liposarcoma treat combination pazopanib topotecan . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate correlation PFR OS level soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( sVEGFR2 ) phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class F ( PIGF ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 topotecan hydrochloride PO day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity discontinuation per patient preference physician recommendation . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 5 year .</detailed_description>
