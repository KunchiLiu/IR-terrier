	<brief_summary>The study determine magnitude duration ( time resolution i.e. , return normal range ) elevation follow coagulation test result single 1200 mg dose oritavancin : Prothrombin Time/International Normalized Ratio ( PT/INR ) , Activated clotting time ( ACT ) , Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( APTT ) , Chromogenic Factor Xa Assay , D-dimer , Silica Clot Time Dilute Russell 's Viper Venom Time ( DRVVT ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oritavancin approve United States treatment adult patient acute bacterial skin skin structure infection ( ABSSSIs ) cause suspect caused susceptible isolates designate Gram-positive microorganism . Antibiotics class ( lipoglycopeptide lipopeptide antibiotic ) artificially prolong phospholipid-dependent coagulation test prothrombin time ( PT ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) bind prevent action phospholipid reagent need activate coagulation . Because precipitation oritavancin show occur human plasma concentration low 50 μg/mL vitro , relevant approach elucidate full range effect oritavancin plasma concentration coagulation test would conduct clinical study healthy volunteer coagulation test monitor follow single 3 hour infusion 1200 mg oritavancin . The data study help inform physician manage patient require coagulation monitoring set treatment oritavancin .</detailed_description>
