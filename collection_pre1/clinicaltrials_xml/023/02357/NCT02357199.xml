	<detailed_description>Aim : The aim examine focus oral care procedure reduce oral infection mirror reduction systemic inflammatory parameter chronic renal disease patient . Specific research question : Can oral infection systemic inflammatory parameter chronic renal disease patient reduce 1 month professional oral care individual prophylactic instruction potential reduction inflammation continuously achieve 3 month follow-up . Study design : Randomized , double-blinded ( investigator , outcomes assessor ) , control study . For Eligibility Criteria Outcome Measures , please see elsewhere ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration System . Participants : A : Hemodialysis patient , inclusion n=34 , B : Hemodialysis patient kidney transplant wait list , inclusion n=34 , C : Patients kidney transplant ( 1-1½ year transplantation ) , inclusion n=34 . D : Gender- age-matched healthy control group . Number include patient estimate hypothesis-generating pilot study , statistical power analysis estimate loss follow-up base experience previous research project Nephrology Department . Intervention control : The intervention consist professional oral care ( address periodontal oral mucosal infection , salivary gland dysfunction caries prevention ) didactic approach individual instruction oral hygiene/prophylactic measure perform dental hygienist three visit : baseline , 2 week baseline 1 month baseline . The research data register blinded investigator first visit dental hygienist 3 month . The control group follow best-clinical-practice procedure currently implement hospital .</detailed_description>
