	<detailed_description>Participants : This study consist approximately 24 premenopausal healthy volunteer woman 18-49 year age intact cervix , uterus , gastrointestinal tract . Women enrol study within 42 day screen depend time menstrual cycle comparison screen visit , study 14 day , follow-up 1-14 day end study sampling . All study visit conduct North Carolina Translational Clinical Sciences ( NCTraCS ) Clinical Translational Research Center ( CTRC ) University North Carolina Chapel Hill . Procedures ( method ) : This Phase 1 , single center , open-label , dose-ranging pharmacokinetic study TFV TFV-DP mucosal tissue concentration measure single dose GS-7340 . Each arm divide three dose group : 5 , 10 , 25mg . Participants take single dose study drug within 7-14 day follow end subject ' menstrual period . Participants sequentially assign one three TAF dose four biopsy schedule . Two woman dose group assign one four biopsy schedule total 8 woman per dose group . Samples blood plasma , cervicovaginal fluid ( CVF ) , cervical tissue , vaginal tissue , rectal tissue collect participant vary time point 14 day post-dose . Subjects return clinic within 14 day last sampling complete follow-up safety visit .</detailed_description>
