	<brief_title>Enhanced Recovery After Surgery : A RCT Perioperative Management Gynecologic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective research implement evaluate enhance recovery pathway gynecologic surgery patient undergo laparotomy compare outcomes current standard care perioperative management . Hypothesis : Patients laparotomy gynecologic disease shorten length hospitalization 30 day post-operatively undergoing perioperative enhance recovery protocol compare standard care . This study randomize single-blinded control trial . Primary Outcomes : Hospital day first 30 day post-operatively ( Length stay primary hospitalization plus day readmission ) Secondary Outcomes : 1 . 30-day readmission rate 2 . Complications assess incidence composite major complication second composite minor complication . 3 . Patient report quality recovery quality life determine QoR-40 score RAND-36 score . 4 . Pain control assessed daily mean pain score ( scale 0-10 ) elicit recorded nursing . All woman meet inclusion criterion approach gynecologic oncology clinic completion appointment . Eligible patient agree participate provide write informed consent . The informed consent process occur clinic exam room . There recruitment method advertisement employ . Patients agree participate time time prior pre-operative teaching appointment schedule point initial surgical consult visit surgery . The first study intervention take place pre-operative teaching appointment enrollment must occur prior time . Randomization occur study entry . The participant randomize one two group : `` standard care '' `` enhance recovery care . '' Randomization stratify disease type , age , BMI . Given long length hospitalization inherent ovarian/primary peritoneal cancer debulking surgery , investigator want stratify base pre-operative suspect diagnosis attempt balance patient group . Similarly , advanced age increase BMI risk factor peri-operative complication increase length hospitalization stratify group . Within stratum , randomization perform block 8 ensure group balance throughout study case recruitment goal reach . Two hundred randomization assignment assign stratum ensure sufficient assignment available group event patient recruit expect . Allocation reveal PI surgical team time randomization . This necessary pre-operative counseling intervention patient `` enhanced recovery '' intervention need occur time . Allocation remain concealed patient member research team conduct post-discharge survey . Two survey instrument used evaluate pre-operative post-operative quality life well quality recovery . The RAND-36 utilized pre-operative 4 week post-operative assessment health-related quality life . This 36 item health-related quality life instrument include eight dimension : general health , physical functioning , emotional wellbeing , social functioning , energy , pain , physical emotional role functioning . While generic assessment quality life design specific surgical recovery-related quality life , investigator include instrument order baseline health-related quality life assessment investigator patient allow comparison study perioperative gynecology patient . The QoR-40 40-question tool use evaluate quality recovery . It incorporate 5 dimension health : patient support , comfort , emotion , physical independence , pain . The QoR40 one widely use measurement patient-determined quality recovery . It extensively validate excellent reliability , responsiveness , clinical utility range surgical setting . Both RAND-36 QoR-40 use study post-operative recovery woman undergo gynecologic surgery find valid . Furthermore , survey validate self-administration telephone administration . Description Intervention Start Study Interventions At pre-operative teach appointment , study participant ask complete health quality life survey . Protocol-specific Interventions : 1 . `` Standard care '' group : Treating physician determine aspect patient ' perioperative care . Specifically , individual surgeon , nurse , resident , fellow , anesthesiologist care patient determine patient ' pre-operative counseling , bowel preparation , postoperative nausea vomit prophylaxis , IV fluid replacement , use drain , time urinary catheter removal , mobilization , post-operative nutrition , pain medication , bowel stimulation . 2 . `` Enhanced recovery '' group : Aspects perioperative care standardize term pre-operative , intra-operative post-operative management issue pre-operative counseling , bowel preparation , postoperative nausea vomit prophylaxis , IV fluid replacement , use drain , time urinary catheter removal , mobilization , post-operative nutrition , pain medication , bowel stimulation . Of note , intervention previously study isolation combination . They consider many standard perioperative management surgical patient Postoperative Interventions All participant survey post-surgery regard quality recovery . Post-discharge Over-the-Phone Interventions Participants call 4 week surgery ask hospital readmission complication time . They also complete post-discharge survey .</detailed_description>
