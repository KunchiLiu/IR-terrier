	<brief_summary>Streptococcus pneumoniae cause high morbidity mortality HIV-positive subject , represent lead etiological agent severe bacterial pneumonia . International guideline recommend HIV positive patient age &gt; =19 year , 13-valent conjugate vaccine ( PCV13 ) na√Øve , receive single dose PCV13 . Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 23-valent ( PPV23 ) give &gt; =8 week indicate dose PCV13 , second dose PPV23 give 5 year later . For previously receive PPV23 , PCV13 administer &gt; =1 year last PPV23 dose . HIV infection affect humoral immunity reduce T-cell help change B-cell compartment . Neither amount circulate memory B cell function restore antiretroviral therapy : may affect antibody mediated immunity , even well-treated HIV patient . In asplenic childrens single dose PCV13 seem sufficient restore pool anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide IgG memory B cell . In adult , report single dose 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine induce significant increase serotype-specific memory B-cell population , conversely , immunization PPV23 seem decrease memory B-cell frequency . However , data immunological response PCV13 HIV positive adult still scanty optimal pneumococcal prophylaxis strategy need investigation . Number PCV13 dose actually demand clinical judgment patient ; also current Italian indication recommend least one dose , till 3 dos seem suggest immunocompromised patient . Present study aim investigate short long term immunological response different standard vaccine schedule evaluate pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization vaccinate patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study divide 3 main aim ; first , long term immunological response PCV13 PPV23 HIV+ adult evaluate . In previous clinical trial ( PRIN 2009 study , Clinicaltrials : NCT02123433 ) cohort HIV positive adult vaccinate either 2 dos PCV13 8 week apart 1 dose PPV23 ( last enrollment : December 2012 ) . Immunoglobulins G ( IgGs ) 12 common pneumococcal serotypes include PCV13 PPV23 quantify ELISA baseline ( BL ) , 8 , 24 48 week : analysis still ongoing ; preliminary data reveal vaccine safe well tolerate show similar immunogenicity . The present study aim evaluate persistence long term ( &gt; = 3 year ) serological memory B cell response previous vaccinate group . In phase , population screen inclusion exclusion criterion entire study conduction . Once obtain informed consent , patient enrol . Together collection blood sample routine purpose , additional blood sample take run immunological test ( ELISA , ELISpot ) . It important underline invasive procedure need study , apart routine clinical practice : blood specimen obtain part routine investigation , blood hence take CD4+ cell count , viraemia analysis anti-HIV drug monitoring ; enrol patient agree donate blood sample research purpose . Blood sample collect previously PCV13 PPV23 vaccinate HIV+ subject serum antibody B cell isotypes analyzed baseline ( BL ) , &gt; = 3 year previous PCV13 PPV23 vaccination . The second objective study aim evaluate short long term immunological response different combined vaccine strategy HIV+ adult . Participants recruit 'll need receive antipneumococcal vaccine ( primary booster ) accord clinical standard indication . Elicited immunological response ( serum antibody B cell isotypes ) explore BL , 8 , 24 , 48 96 week additional different receive pneumococcal vaccine strategy . At BL , collect blood sample previously describe Aim1 , every patient assign specific Group basis receive vaccine schedule , prescribe clinician accord individual clinical indication . Short- ( 30 minute ) , medium- ( &lt; =5 day ) long-term adverse reaction report , clinical evaluation within 30 minute post-vaccine , phone call day 5 anamnestic data collection follow 8 , 24 , 48 96 week . Blood sample analyze 8 , 24 , 48 96 week evaluate serum antibody B cell isotypes . Finally , third aim study lead epidemiological microbiological survey vaccinate HIV+ adult . At BL , 8 , 24 , 48 96 week clinical-anamnestic data update , together blood sample analysis title IgG towards vaccinal pneumococcal polysaccharide evaluate B cell isotypes nasopharyngeal swab S. pneumoniae culture , vitro chemosusceptibility test , serotyping , clonal analysis Multilocus Locus Sequence Typing ( MLST ) . Carriage define S. pneumoniae isolation one nasal swab , absence clinical sign symptom ; 12 month clinical follow perform colonized patient . All patient develop infection follow resolution .</detailed_description>
