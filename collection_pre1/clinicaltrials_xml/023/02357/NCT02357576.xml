	<brief_summary>Parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis ( PNAC ) liver disease ( PNALD ) associate significant morbidity mortality neonates felt exacerbate soybean-based lipid emulsion . Much research currently direct identify way reduce risk . Reduction dose soybean-based lipid give component parenteral nutrition one possible strategy . In study compare standard dose soybean-based lipid ( 3/kg/day ) minimize dose ( 1 g/kg/day ) evaluate development cholestasis adequate growth two group . Longterm followup include assessment neurodevelopmental outcome 12 24 month age . Funding source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>
