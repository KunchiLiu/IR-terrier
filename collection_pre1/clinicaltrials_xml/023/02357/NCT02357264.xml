	<brief_summary>This project study use ultrasound chest detection fluid lung patient pre-eclampsia vs pregnant patient without pre-eclampsia . Pre-eclampsia syndrome usually diagnose second half pregnancy patient develop elevate blood pressure may develop protein urine , neurologic abnormality , fluid lung , abnormal blood test associate liver kidney . Pulmonary edema ( fluid lung ) pre-eclampsia lead patient discomfort significant morbidity mortality . It detect use chest x-ray , although type image offer significant disadvantage , include radiation , particular concern pregnant patient . In addition , previous study demonstrate chest x-ray accurate detection fluid lung . Multiple previous study demonstrate utility chest ultrasonography detect fluid chest , although vast majority study involve patient acute decompensated heart failure . Our goal evaluate bedside ultrasound chest patient pre-eclampsia comparison normal pregnant patient determine whether patient abnormal fluid chest . The investigator divide patient two group . In study group , investigator include patient pre-eclampsia without shortness breath , control group , investigator include pregnant patient without pre-eclampsia . Informed consent obtain patient enrol study . These patient undergo ultrasound chest , perform member Emergency Medicine Ultrasound Division . The image transmit wirelessly ultrasound machine secure web base cloud ( Q-path ) subsequently review expert reviewer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project compare use ultrasound chest detection fluid lung patient pre-eclampsia vs pregnant patient without pre-eclampsia . Patients admit obstetrical service recruit study enrollment . We divide patient two group . In study group , include patient pre-eclampsia without shortness breath , control group , include otherwise healthy pregnant patient . We exclude patient labor undergoing induction . Informed consent obtain patient enrol study . Study subject undergo ultrasound chest , perform member Emergency Medicine Ultrasound Division , experience perform lung ultrasound . Both hemithoraces divide 4 zone : anterior inferior , anterior superior , lateral inferior , lateral superior . Each zone assess presence B-lines . For zone consider `` positive '' pulmonary edema , minimum 3 B-lines . To diagnose patient pulmonary edema , least two zone hemithoraces must positive . The study investigator document presence B-lines particular zone data collection sheet . Brief representative video clip record zone . After complete sonographic examination , image transmit wirelessly ultrasound machine secure web base cloud ( Q-path ) subsequently interpret expert reviewer blind clinical information patient . They also document finding separate data collection sheet .</detailed_description>
