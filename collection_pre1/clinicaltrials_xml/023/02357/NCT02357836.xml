	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Itraconazole Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 0 clinical trial . While clinical data include safety record , principal outcome pharmacodynamic endpoint . Specifically , investigator seek identify : ( 1 ) effect itraconazole tumor angiogenesis , ( 2 ) effect itraconazole Hh pathway , ( 3 ) biomarker predictor effect , ( 4 ) correlation itraconazole pharmacokinetics effect , ( 5 ) correlation different biomarkers . Up 15 eligible patient previously diagnose suspect NSCLC plan resection undergo study-specific core needle biopsy , image ( dynamic contrast enhance [ DCE ] - , diffusion weight image [ DWI ] - , arterial spin label [ ASL ] magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) , skin punch biopsy , collection peripheral blood . Subjects receive itraconazole 600 mg PO daily 7-10 day , follow undergo repeat imaging , skin biopsy , blood collection . Subsequently undergo surgical resection . Due safety profile itraconazole use antifungal agent , histologic subtypes NSCLC eligible trial . The itraconazole dose 600 mg , high anti-angiogenic dose , show inhibit Hedgehog ( Hh ) pathway .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically cytologically proven NSCLC plan surgical resection . All NSCLC histologic subtypes eligible . Alternatively , patient diagnosis NSCLC highly suspect base history image study , therefore , schedule diagnostic biopsy and/or surgical resection also eligible screening , enrollment , study treatment meet additional eligibility criterion . In event biopsy confirm NSCLC , patient remove study monitor adverse event result study participation . 2 . No prior therapy plan surgical resection 3 . Age ≥ 18 year . 4 . ECOG 02 performance status 5 . Adequate organ function define : total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SPGT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine ≤ 2 X institutional upper limit normal 6 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 90 day follow completion therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 6.1 A female childbearing potential woman ( regardless sexual orientation , undergone tubal ligation , remain celibate choice ) meet follow criterion : Has undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; Has naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) . 7 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . 1 . Subjects may receive investigational agent would confound interpretation study pharmacodynamic endpoint . 2 . History allergic reaction attribute itraconazole compound similar chemical biologic composition itraconazole . 3 . Uncontrolled , concurrent medical illness . 4 . Active hepatitis symptomatic liver disease . 5 . History current evidence uncontrolled cardiac ventricular dysfunction ( congestive heart failure ) NYHA Class III IV heart failure . 6 . Current use medication significantly affect metabolism itraconazole ( certain anticonvulsant , corticosteroid ) . See 3.5 Drug Interactions protocol . 7 . Current evidence hyperthyroidism ( would increase metabolism itraconazole ) . 8 . Pregnant lactate female female try get pregnant . 9 . Claustrophobia would interfere MRI study anticipate last 4550 minute . 10 . Metal implant deem risk migration MRI study . 11 . CrCl &lt; 45 mL/min ( increase risk nephrogenic systemic fibrosis [ NSF ] MRI Gadolinium contrast ) . 12 . Known allergy MRI contrast .</criteria>
