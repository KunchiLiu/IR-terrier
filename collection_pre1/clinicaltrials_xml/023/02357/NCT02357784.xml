	<brief_summary>Women Dual Incontinence ( DI ) ( Urinary Incontinence ( UI ) Fecal Incontinence ( FI ) ) often bothersome symptom , quality life impact , sexual dysfunction UI FI . In many situation , DI result failure communication brain sacral nerve , control bladder , bowel , pelvic floor . The currently available treatment level 1 effectiveness data treatment BOTH UI FI call Sacral Neuromodulation ( SNM ) . Sacral Neuromodulation standard care treatment involve surgically implanting device patient 's body target communication issue brain bladder/bowel . Because exact mechanism action SNM remain unclear , study aim well understand SNM affect nerve patient DI . Patients already plan undergo SNM device implantation recruit study . Study participant undergo Current Perception Threshold ( CPT ) Testing fill questionnaires SNM 3 month SNM treatment . CPT Testing use mild electrical stimulation urethra rectum measure quantify amount physical stimulus require nerve pelvic floor sense stimulus . By learn nerve function patient DI , investigator hope find way screen patient treatment SNM make sure treatment effective individual .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sacral Neuromodulation Dual Incontinence : Ultrasound Afferent Nerve Sensation Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One four woman report bothersome symptom pelvic floor disorder 16 % reporting urinary incontinence ( UI ) , otherwise know leakage . Likewise , 1 5 woman UI report fecal incontinence ( FI ) . Women dual incontinence ( UI/FI ) often bothersome symptom , quality life impact , sexual dysfunction UI FI . In many situation , bladder and/or bowel control problem result failure communication brain sacral nerve . The sacral nerve control bladder , bowel , pelvic floor muscle relate function . If brain sacral nerve communicate correctly , bladder and/or bowel function properly , often lead incontinence , leakage . The currently available treatment level 1 effectiveness data treatment BOTH UI FI call Sacral Neuromodulation . Sacral Neuromodulation ( SNM ) standard care procedure use treat men woman symptom Urinary Fecal Incontinence involve surgically implanting device patient 's body target communication problem stimulate nerve control bladder bowel function mild electrical pulse . This help brain nerve communicate bladder bowel function properly . It known change nerve stimulation muscular function important factor cause onset UI FI patient respond various treatment , however , precise mechanism action SNM UI FI remain unclear . This study therefore aim obtain good understand nerve muscle function patient dual incontinence quantify SNM affect nerve patient dual incontinence . We hope use Current Perception Threshold ( CPT ) Testing , way quantify function different population afferent nerve . We recruit patient already plan undergo Sacral Neuromodulation implantation treatment dual incontinence , part research study use CPT test measure amount stimulation require activate participant 's sacral nerve SNM also measure current perception threshold participant 's sacral nerve SNM treatment . We expect see difference amount stimulation require activate different pelvic floor nerve device implantation . By learn nerve function patient DI , hope find way screen patient treatment SNM make sure treatment work . We also hope learn urethral anal sphincter anatomy patient dual incontinence change treatment SNM . Lastly , study quality sexual relationship woman dual incontinence male partner attempt identify specific area dysfunction common patient DI .</detailed_description>
