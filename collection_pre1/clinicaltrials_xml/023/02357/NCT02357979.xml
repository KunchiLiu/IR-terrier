	<brief_title>Fissure Caries Inhibition Study With Solea CO2-9.3μm Short-pulsed Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design randomize , single blind , prospective , split mouth control , clinical trial 12 month . The subject study recruit UCSF School Dentistry . Patients meet inclusion criterion UCSF Predoctoral , Postgraduate Pediatric Dental Postgraduate orthodontic clinic study explain invited participate . Young patient moderate/high caries risk invite enroll study . They pair two molar treat far caries free seal . The molar patient 's dominant side ( right left ) randomly assign either test control group contralateral non-dominant side receive treatment . The test tooth treat CO2 laser irradiation fluoride varnish ; control tooth receive fluoride varnish treatment alone . A baseline visual inspection use ICDAS II , white blue light digital photograph ( SOPROLIFE ) , DIAGNOdent assessment make dentist prior treatment . The patient ask return 6-month 12-month follow exam , time visual inspection test method conduct dentist originally complete baseline exam . The endpoint study participant either control test tooth find significant demineralization ICDAS assessment ( ICDAS code 3 - `` localized enamel breakdown without clinical visual sign dentinal involvement '' ) 12 month exam , whichever come first . The control test teeth might seal dental sealant end study . All data obtain analyzed statistical significance .</detailed_description>
