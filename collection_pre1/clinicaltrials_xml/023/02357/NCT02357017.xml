	<brief_summary>The purpose study test hypothesis persistent fluid retention high sympathetic output contributes development refractory hypertension ( HTN ) . The investigator determine , cross-over assessment high low salt diet , dietary sodium restriction reduce 24-hr ambulatory BP patient refractory HTN . Moreover , investigator determine dietary sodium restriction lessen severity obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) patient refractory HTN .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms Refractory Hypertension ( High Low Salt Diet )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose unique phenotype antihypertensive treatment failure refer refractory HTN . We come feel resistant ( RHTN ) represent broad phenotype multiple overlap etiology treatment resistance , unique subset patient never achieve BP control spite maximal therapy . In recently publish retrospective analysis clinic experience , find patient refractory HTN comprise 10 % patient refer u RHTN . A large number intervention study verify benefit dietary salt restriction reduce BP . We make assessment prospective , randomize , cross-over comparison high- low salt diet 12 patient confirm RHTN . The average reduction BP go high low salt diet 23/10 mmHg clinic 20/10 mmHg 24-hr ambulatory BP monitoring . These dramatic result demonstrate patient RHTN exquisitely salt-sensitive highlight degree BP reduction accomplish meaningful salt restriction . However , propose novel hypothesis refractory HTN mechanistically unique RHTN secondary recalcitrant fluid retention . Determining association dietary salt restriction severity obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) would potentially help u find new therapy guide towards achieve good control BP patient refractory HTN . We investigate effect dietary salt intake severity OSA vascular function patient refractory HTN vascular study ( pulse wave analysis/velocity , calculate thoracic impedance ) ) .</detailed_description>
