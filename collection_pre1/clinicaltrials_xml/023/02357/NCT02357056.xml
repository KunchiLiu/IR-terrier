	<brief_summary>The purpose research objectively compare various train modality currently available minimally invasive robotic surgery determine effective training method specific robotic cardiac surgery . We hope recruit medical trainee minimal robotic surgery training experience , randomly assign one three group ( Dry wab , da Vinci Simulator Wet lab ) . Trainees evaluate baseline standardized task common robotic cardiac surgery divide one three training modality . Trainees give sufficient time become proficient variety predetermine task unique train group . The trainee undergo reevaluation cardiac surgery specific task end standard training period . We able compare three group show benefit others regard improvement technical ability , understand robot function , efficacy training , speed technical skill development , accuracy efficiency movement . We rate modality reproducibility , accuracy representation , ease set perform cost analysis train method .</brief_summary>
