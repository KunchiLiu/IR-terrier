	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn high-flow oxygen , low-flow oxygen , high-flow air , low-flow air , give structure exercise session , help reduce difficulty breathe cancer patient . Researchers also want learn therapy help improve lung function quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Flow Oxygen Exertional Dyspnea Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , 3 day complete baseline cycle test ( describe ) , randomly assign ( roll dice ) receive 1 follow 4 treatment second cycle test . Your study group assignment also base breathing symptom screen . - High-flow oxygen - Low-flow oxygen - High-flow air - Low-flow air You equal chance assign group . Neither study staff know treatment assign . However , need safety , study staff able find receiving . Study Visits : Baseline Cycle Tests : At time convenient screening , perform cycle test use stationary bicycle . You pedal resistance 60 second , warm 2 minute . You perform cycle test receive low-flow air long . Every 2 minute cycle test blood pressure , heart rate , blood oxygen level check . After 2-hour rest , perform cycle test use low-flow air long . Before cycle test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) check heart function . Second Cycle Test : About 3 day baseline cycle test ( Â± 2 day ) , take part second cycle test . Before test , EKG . During test , receive type study treatment assign screen test . After cycle test , fill questionnaire complete screen . Length Study : You may take study problem complete either cycle test . Your participation study complete second cycle test fill questionnaire . This investigational study . The use high-flow air , low-flow air , high-flow oxygen , low-flow oxygen exercise treat breathing symptom consider investigational . Up 50 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
