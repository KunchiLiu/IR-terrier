	<brief_title>Study Anti-PD-1 Antibody Nivolumab Combination With Dabrafenib and/or Trametinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients ask take part clinical research study BRAF- NRAS-mutated metastatic melanoma . If participate receive investigational drug nivolumab combination dabrafenib and/or trametinib base medical diagnosis , BRAF V600 test result and/or NRAS-mutated status . The research study evaluate safety efficacy two drug nivolumab dabrafenib nivolumab trametinib . Once evaluate , additional subject enrol treatment triplicate ( 3 drug ) nivolumab , dabrafenib trametinib together . A treatment cycle 28 day , coincide administration nivolumab . The DLT evaluation period restrict cycle 1 , although toxicity subsequent cycle closely evaluate . In trametinib-containing arm , load dose give day 1 2 cycle 1 allow steady state concentration achieve within one week administration . In absence treatment delay due adverse event ( ) , treatment may continue 3 year one follow criterion applies : - Disease progression - Intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment - Unacceptable adverse event ( ) - Patient decide withdraw study - General specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator Patients consider evaluable toxicity receive 1 complete cycle therapy , experience dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) . Definition DLTs include : - Any Grade 2 drug-related uveitis eye pain blur vision respond topical therapy improve Grade 1 severity within re-treatment period OR require systemic treatment - Any Grade 3 non-skin , drug-related adverse event last &gt; 7 day , follow exception drug-related laboratory abnormality , uveitis , pneumonitis , bronchospasm , diarrhea , colitis , neurologic adverse event , hypersensitivity reaction , infusion reaction - Grade 3 drug-related uveitis , pneumonitis , bronchospasm , diarrhea , colitis , neurologic adverse event , hypersensitivity reaction , infusion reaction duration require discontinuation - Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormality require treatment discontinuation except follow : Grade 3 drug-related thrombocytopenia &gt; 7 day associate bleeding require discontinuation ; Any drug-related liver function test ( LFT ) abnormality meet follow criterion require discontinuation - AST ALT &gt; 8 x ULN ; Total bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN ; Concurrent AST ALT &gt; 3 x ULN total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN ; - Any Grade 4 drug-related adverse event laboratory abnormality , except follow event require discontinuation : - Isolated Grade 4 amylase lipase abnormality associate symptom clinical manifestation pancreatitis decrease &lt; Grade 4 within 1 week onset . - Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities associate clinical sequela correct supplementation/appropriate management within 72 hour onset - Any dosing interruption last &gt; 6 week follow exception : - Dosing interruption allow prolong steroid taper manage drug-related adverse event allow . Prior re-initiating treatment subject dose interruption last &gt; 6 week , Investigator must consult . Tumor assessment continue per protocol even dose interrupt - Dosing interruption &gt; 6 week occur non-drug-related reason may allow approve Investigator . Prior re-initiating treatment subject dose interruption last &gt; 6 week , Investigator must consult . Tumor assessment continue per protocol even dose interrupt Any adverse event , laboratory abnormality , intercurrent illness , judgment Investigator , present substantial clinical risk subject continue nivolumab dosing . Patients follow 2 year removal study death , whichever occur first , standard care visit medical record review . Patients remove study unacceptable adverse event ( ) follow resolution stabilization adverse event .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm metastatic melanoma ( Stage IV ) unresectable Stage III melanoma BRAF V600E/K NRAS mutation . Prior therapy metastatic melanoma allow , include chemo , cytokine , immuno , biological vaccinetherapy long include BRAFi , MEKi , nivolumab . Prior ipilimumab therapy allow washout period 8 week autoimmune adverse event resolve grade 1 . Evidence evaluable disease . ECOG Performance Status 0 1 . Stable CNS disease allow . Subjects brain metastasis eligible ( ) metastases treated magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evidence progression 4 week treatment complete within 28 day prior first dose nivolumab administration ; ( b ) untreated asymptomatic require steroid therapy . Patients exclude require high dos systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 2 week prior study drug administration , could result immunosuppression . Patients must normal organ marrow function define normal laboratory range . Screening laboratory value must meet follow criterion obtain within 28 day prior registration : WBC ≥ 2000/μL Neutrophils ≥ 1500/μL Platelets ≥ 100 x103/μL Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥ 40 mL/min ( use CockcroftGault formula ) : Female CrCl = ( 140 age year ) x weight kg x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL Male CrCl = ( 140 age year ) x weight kg x 1.00 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL AST/ALT ≤ 3 x ULN Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( except subject Gilbert Syndrome , total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL ) Men woman age≥18 year . Life expectancy great than12 week . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 23 week ( 30 day plus time require nivolumab undergo five halflives ) last dose investigational drug . WOCBP surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 72 hour prior start nivolumab . Men sexually active WOCBP must use contraceptive method failure rate le 1 % per year . Men receive nivolumab sexually active WOCBP instruct adhere contraception period 31 week last dose investigational product . Women childbearing potential ( i.e. , postmenopausal surgically sterile ) azoospermic men require contraception . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Histologically confirm metastatic melanoma ( Stage IV ) NRAS BRAFwild type . Grade 3/4 immunerelated AEs ipilimumab require 12 week immune suppression corticosteroid . History interstitial lung disease pneumonitis . History known glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency . Active leptomeningeal metastasis untreated symptomatic brain metastasis . Active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects permit enroll vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger . Require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement dos &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease . Known history positive test hepatitis B virus hepatitis C virus indicate acute chronic infection . Known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction dabrafenib trametinib . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . History allergy adverse drug reaction study drug component ( nivolumab , dabrafenib , trametinib ) drug similar chemical biologic composition . Patients history severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody also exclude . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant and/or breastfeed woman exclude study . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother dabrafenib trametinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated dabrafenib trametinib . These potential risk may also apply agent use study .</criteria>
