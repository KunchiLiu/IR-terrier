	<brief_summary>Pyridostigmine acetylcholinesterase inhibitor , degrade acetylcholine neuromuscular junction . Based recent study , pyridostigmine may effective adjuvant treatment people Pompe disease , increase functional impact neurotransmitter . Hypothesis : use pyridostigmine Pompe disease improve transmission acetylcholine across neuromuscular junction , skeletal muscle function , respiratory function , quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Pyridostigmine Pompe Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pompe rare disease , occur approximately 1 per 40,000 birth . It progressive often fatal neuromuscular disorder result mutation gene acid alpha-glucosidase ( GAA ) , enzyme necessary degrade glycogen . Accumulation glycogen multiple tissue result cardiac , respiratory skeletal muscle dysfunction . Enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) currently treatment available , although prolongs survival , adjuvant therapy need help alleviate dire symptom Pompe disease . Recent data reveal degradation neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) occur Pompe disease . Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ( AChEI ) substances inhibit AChE enzyme degrade acetylcholine NMJ , thus increase functional impact neurotransmitter . AChEI establish beneficial therapy individual primary disease NMJ , myasthenia gravis . Recently , administration AChEI demonstrate improve NMJ pathology mouse individual affect congenital myopathy , include autosomal centronuclear myopathy ( CNM ) , X-linked myotubular myopathy ( XLMTM ) mutation tropomyosin 3 ( TPM3 ) . Specifically , NMJ transmission motor function improve . These study demonstrate AChEI beneficial myopathy associate NMJ pathology . In study , study acute effect pyridostigmine neuromuscular transmission , well prolonged effect respiratory function , skeletal muscle function quality life 90 day treatment period . This project focus develop adjuvant treatment ERT target dysfunction NMJ . Our ultimate goal reduce deleterious consequence Pompe disease improve overall quality duration life affect individual .</detailed_description>
