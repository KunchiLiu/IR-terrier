	<detailed_description>Uterine leiomyoma common benign tumor female genital tract . Submucosal fibroid 10 % uterine myoma . They grow inside uterine cavity usually associate menorrhagia , abnormal uterine bleeding ( AUB ) infertility . According degree myometrial penetration , European Society Gynaecological Endoscopy ( ESGE ) classify submucosal myoma Type 0 ( G0 , totally intracavitary fibroid ) , Type I ( G1 , &lt; 50 % myometral penetration ) , Type II ( G2 , &gt; 50 % myometral penetration ) . Hysteroscopic removal submucosal myomas improve menorrhagia AUB challenge woman Type II ( G2 ) fibroid , since often require surgery due particular position context myometrium . Surgery , moreover , always tailor , particularly patient wish conceive , preserve integrity myometrium . In particular population , indeed , possibility avoid kind uterine surgery always exploit . Up , hysteroscopic resection submucosal fibroid consider gold standard symptomatic patient , since medication able restore uterine cavity permanent manner . In set , use GnRH agonist surgery still matter debate , literature report preoperative use GnRH agonist appear relevant beneficial patient submucous fibroid . Benefits include resolution preoperative anemia , decrease fibroid size , reduction endometrial thickness vascularization subsequently improve visibility reduce fluid absorption , possibility surgical scheduling . Conversely , preoperative treatment associate side effect hot flush postinjection endometrial bleeding due flare-up effect . Data SPRM show eighty percent patient treat UPA show clinically meaningful reduction 25 % fibroid volume , 50 % patient reduction 50 % . In subpopulation patient undergoing surgery , fibroid volume reduction appear maintain 6 month end UPA treatment . This contrast patient receive GnRH agonist , fibroid begin regrow 1 3 month last dose , reach baseline size 6 month . No sub-analysis conduct submucosal fibroid , interest underline , myomas regress much longer distort uterine cavity , surgery may require . This could represent safe way avoid surgery patient G2 fibroid desire pregnancy .</detailed_description>
