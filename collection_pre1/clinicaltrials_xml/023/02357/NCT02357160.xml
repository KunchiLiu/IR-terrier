	<detailed_description>The art long play role health heal date back 14th century painting ushered patient good death immortalize patron charitable activity . Today , half hospital dedicate art program range permanent display art throughout building art therapy bedside performance public space wait area . Offered patient range condition , family visitor , program aim `` improve patient ' overall health outcome , treatment compliance quality life '' . Yet , patient survey indicate interior design feature artwork make hospital environment less institutionalized emotionally please , randomize control trial link specific design feature intervention directly impact healthcare outcome . The Value Integrating Visual Arts : Evaluating Benefits Hospital Room Artwork Inpatient Wellbeing add significantly data . The physical environment inpatient hospital room essentially provide blank canvas study impact visual art patient outcome . Studies show patient care physical surroundings , effort recent year aim make hospital room less austere , case , remain institutional environment . The Pick-a-Pic Program Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center address problem allow patient modify one aspect physical environment personal selection art print local , professional artist display room hospitalization . Placed frames mounted wall directly patient ' line vision hospital bed , print help create supportive comforting environment . Their efficacy predicate capacity visual art provide positive distraction patient family member cop stress illness add personal touch hospital environment make space familiar homelike possible . This project draw upon distraction theory , posit patient become engrossed open positive distraction attend less pain even experience reduce altered perception pain . Changing even one environmental factor—such introduce visual stimulus—can provide distraction . Burn patient , instance , watch video nature scene accompany music burn dress change find experience less pain report less anxiety . Similar finding report patient viewed nature scene heard nature sound undergoing painful flexible bronchoscopy . In study involve healthy volunteer , participant show videos nature scenes—some music without—had high pain threshold pain tolerance volunteer star blank black screen . Positive distraction part healthcare physical environment also find effective diminishing feeling stress accompany psychological physiological impact . When video , still art , window film nature image introduce two emergency department , researcher note reduction behavior indicative stress anxiety . Artwork find positive effect patient ' mood well . The propose study - The Value Integrating Visual Arts ( VIVA ) : Evaluating Benefits Hospital Room Artwork Inpatient Wellbeing - build finding advance novel significant way . First , rare three-arm randomize control trial large participant number design quantitatively assess benefit visual art individual . The participant study represent specific subgroup—i.e. , patients—with discrete disease diagnosis cancer undergo treatment Cancer Institute Penn State Hershey Medical Center . According Center Disease Control , 19 million adult , almost one ten Americans , diagnose cancer . Widely know one disruptive illness affect human being , cancer treatment painful invasive , patient family must cope feeling anxiety , vulnerability , uncertainty - feeling exacerbate stark medicalized environment . Positive visual stimulus form artwork capacity provide biopsychosocial respite capture measurable patient outcomes physical psychological trauma . While research study particularly relevant cancer patient , finding project hold promise hospital inpatient subject sort environmental stimuli undergo institutional treatment . According CDC , report 35.1 million inpatient annually receive care U.S. hospital , average length stay 4.8 day . As clinical economic data traditionally carry great weight decision hospital administrator , study potential produce strong scientific data establish visual art environmental modification clear persuasive benefit hospital patient deserve investment . This study also innovative link measurable patient outcome patient control one aspect hospital physical environment—namely , artwork inpatient room . Studies examine artwork physiological outcome largely involved view nature windows representational nature scene , provide rather chosen patient . In study involve patient choice , focus often determine patient ' preference different kind artwork—e.g. , representational nature scene vs. abstract , rural scene vs. urban—with eye develop guideline art selection placement . While qualitative data exist show patient able influence physical environment report increase feeling emotional physical comfort well improve mood , study use rigorous study design measure benefit choice artwork medical outcome . Finally , study innovative use single lens—visual arts—to examine benefit art hospital room patient satisfaction , key parameter healthcare provider today 's competitive market . Other examination physical environment include architectural feature size shape hospital room , ambient feature light temperature , color . By specify room décor patient satisfaction survey , study provide hospital strong persuasive data relatively low-cost way improve aesthetic patient ' room . Indeed , print artwork used Pick-a-Pic program medical center cost $ 90 produce . This research study seek answer ( 1 ) whether presence visual arts patient 's hospital room significantly improve patient outcome measure perception anxiety , report pain , use pain medication , request nurse staff ; ( 2 ) whether patient 's personal choice visual art print ( versus print choice ) significantly improve outcome ; ( 3 ) whether presence visual art significantly improve patient satisfaction physical environment .</detailed_description>
