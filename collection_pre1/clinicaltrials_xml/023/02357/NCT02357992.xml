	<brief_title>Lung Cancer STARS Trial - STARS Revised Clinical Trial Protocol : Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy ( SABR ) Stage I Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Who Can Undergo Lobectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Treatment : The treatment use study consider standard , researcher want see outcome early-stage NSCLC . The radiation ( SRT ) study design kill tumor cell use beams radiation aim directly tumor different angle . The doctor use compute tomography ( CT ) scan plan exactly direct beam go . A computer use show location , size , shape tumor . SRT design cause less damage normal tissue surgery , also may allow high dose radiation give tumor form radiation therapy use . The SRT study perform use radiation machine call Linear Accelerator ( Linac ) . Study Group : If find eligible take part study , receive SRT ( out-patient ) day 3-4 day row . You ask hold still entire treatment ( 1 1 1/2 hour time ) . The machine move around , see feel anything ( similar get x-ray ) . Follow-Up Visits : During treatment period , see doctor and/or research nurse order check side effect . A physical exam perform , medical history record . These follow-up procedure do day SRT . A physical exam perform medical history record 6 12 month , 1 1/2 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 year SRT . If doctor decides necessary , chest x-ray check status disease . At 6 12 month SRT , either PET-CT scan CT scan check status disease . At 1 year SRT , breathe test check lung function . You also CT scan check status disease . At 1 1/2 year 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 year SRT , CT scan check status disease . Possible Re-Treatment On Study : If one follow-up CT scan show tumor come back location close , PET scan tumor biopsy . The purpose confirm status disease . To collect tumor biopsy , affect area numb anesthetic , small amount tissue withdrawn large needle . As soon result scan biopsy come back , study doctor discuss different treatment option . You may receive surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy , depend status disease . You receive separate consent form describe treatment detail , well risk . After `` re-treatment '' , stay schedule study follow-up visit follow . Length Study Participation : Your participation study 5-year follow-up visit . This investigational study . The treatment commercially available consider standard early-stage NSCLC . This include use Linac radiation machine , FDA approve commercially available . Up 80 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histological confirmation nonsmall cell cancer require either biopsy cytology . The following primary cancer type eligible : squamous cell carcinoma , adenocarcinoma without BAC feature , large cell carcinoma without neuroendocrine feature , neuroendocrine carcinoma , bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma , nonsmall cell carcinoma otherwise specify . 2 . Eligible patient must appropriate stag study identify specific subset revise IASLC stage IA base follow combination TNM staging : T1a , N0 , M0 T1b , N0 , M0 3 . A PET/CT scan require . Patients hilar mediastinal lymph node short axis diameter &lt; /= 1cm abnormal hilar mediastinal uptake PET consider N0 . Patients &gt; 1 cm short axis diameter hilar mediastinal lymph node CT abnormal PET ( include suspicious nondiagnostic uptake ) may still eligible directed tissue biopsy abnormally identify area negative cancer . Solitary pulmonary lesion &lt; /= 6mm consider significant . 4 . Patients must consider candidate surgical resection primary tumor . Standard justification deem patient medically operable base pulmonary function surgical resection NSCLC may include follow : Baseline FEV1 &gt; 40 % predict , postoperative predict FEV1 &gt; 30 % predict , diffusion capacity &gt; 40 % predict , absent baseline hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia , exercise oxygen consumption &gt; 50 % predict , absent severe pulmonary hypertension , absent severe cerebral , cardiac , peripheral vascular disease , absent severe chronic heart disease . 5 . Patients must &gt; /= 18 year age . 6 . The patient 's Zubrod performance status must Zubrod 02 . 7 . PET/CT scan include lung , mediastinum , adrenal gland ; Primary tumor dimension measure diagnostic CT simulation CT. Must do within 10 week prior study entry . 8 . Mediastinoscopy endobronchial ultrasound ( EBUS ) guide biopsy mediastinal lymph node require patient . Must do within 10 week study entry . 9 . MRI CT scan Brain symptom sign suggest brain metastasis , must do within 10 week prior study entry . 10 . Invasive Mediastinal Staging All patient CT and/or PET evidence hilar ( level 10 ) mediastinal lymph node &gt; 1.0 cm shortest diameter must stag either cervical mediastinoscopy , esophageal endoscopic ultrasound guide biopsy , endobronchial ultrasound guide biopsy . 11 . Patients must sign studyspecific consent form . 12 . Patients ( men woman ) child bear potential use effective ( ) method birth control throughout participation study . 1 . Patients primary tumor &gt; 3 cm . 2 . Patients welldifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma ( carcinoid tumor ) . 3 . Direct evidence regional distant metastasis appropriate stag study , synchronous primary prior malignancy past 3 year nonmelanomatous skin cancer situ cancer . 4 . Previous lung mediastinal radiotherapy . 5 . Plans patient receive concomitant local therapy ( include standard fractionate radiotherapy surgery ) protocol except disease progression . 6 . Pregnant lactate woman , treatment involve unforeseeable risk embryo fetus . 7 . Can achieve acceptable SABR planning meet minimal requirement target coverage dosevolume constraint critical structure ( see RT technique ) .</criteria>
