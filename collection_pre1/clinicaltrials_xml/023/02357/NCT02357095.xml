	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether UACE ( uterine artery chemo-embolization ) follow suction curettage guidance ultrasonography hysteroscopy decrease complication treatment Caesarean scar pregnancy ( CSP ) . CSP special form ectopic implantation within fibrous tissue surround previous delivery caesarean scar . The probability CSP 1:1800 1:2,226 pregnancy , 6.1 % ectopic pregnancy cesarean delivery . It 's long-term complication cesarean delivery serious consequence , uterine rupture massive uterine bleeding.There ten method treat CSP , however , universal management guideline establish . Present method CSP treatment include:1 ) medical treatment , usually systemic local methotrexate（MTX） ; 2）suction curettage ; 3 ) medicine combine uterine curettage ; 3）surgical treatment（hysteroscopic , laparoscopic vaginal surgery） ; 4 ) uterine artery embolization ( UAE ) ; 5 ) The combine use method . Moreover , rupture CSP heavy bleeding may still occur follow medical treatment.Suction curettage excision CSP associate profuse bleed . Surgical treatment less micro-traumatic nonsurgical intervention . For CSP , UAE follow suction curettage appear advantage systemic MTX treatment may priority option.So author suggest curettage systemic methotrexate therapy embolization single treatment avoid possible , combination effective . Plenty evidence suggest UACE follow suction curettage guidance ultrasonography hysteroscopy priority choice . However , clinical practice , suction curettage CSP difficult usual induced abortion procedure normal early pregnancy , PCSD ( previous cesarean scar defect ) common CSP.In random population incidence PCSD present 24 % -69 % woman evaluate transvaginal sonography . Scar defect see 61 % ( 66/108 ) , 81 % ( 35/43 ) 100 % ( 11/11 ) woman undergo one , two least three Cesarean section transvaginal ultrasound examination . What incidence complication suction curettage combine UACE CSP treatment remain unknown.How decrease complication remain unknown too.So design study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At first , investigator evaluate sample size 108 least software PASS11 , actually 144 finally.Then CSP patient visit transferred Maternal Child Health Hospital Hubei Province ( China ) June 2010 June 2014 recruited.Every patient number chronological sequence.Then participant randomly assign three arm use randomization table : Group A ( Group hysteroscopic monitoring ) , Group B ( Group ultrasonography monitoring ) , Group C ( Group monitoring ) . Randomization conduct via system seal numbered envelope . Everybody receive UACE ( uterine artery chemo-embolization ) first . Superselective embolization uterine artery perform use gelatin sponge particles two experienced radiologist . After puncture right femoral artery , 5-F Roberts uterine artery catheter correctly place bilateral uterine artery guidance 0.889-mm guidewire.A 50mg dose MTX infuse bilaterally prior gelatin sponge particle selective embolism procedure . Postembolization angiography perform confirm occlusion vessel complete . Within 24-48 h UACE , woman underwent suction curettage.The subatmospheric pressure 200～500mmHg suction curettage . Women assign Group A ( Group hysteroscopic monitoring ) receive UACE follow suction curettage hysteroscopic monitoring.Before suction curettage , hysteroscopy performed.If residual tissue find , suction curettage would perform remove . Women assign Group B ( Group ultrasonography monitoring ) receive UACE follow suction curettage ultrasonography monitoring.The suction curettage procedure perform abdominal ultrasonography real- time monitoring.When nothing residual ultrasonography , procedure complete . Women assign Group C ( Group monitoring ) receive UACE follow suction curettage without monitoring . All patient observe hospitalization . Ages , weight , gravidity , parity , week gestation , clinical manifestation CSP , estimate blood loss , operation time , length uterine cavity PCSD ( previous cesarean scar defect ) , side effect ( fever , nausea , low abdominal pain ) record . The serum β-hCG level renal , hepatic function , complete blood count measure intervention . The size gestation sac heterogeneous mass measure transvaginal ultrasound time . The patient follow measure serum β-hCG level every week β-hCG level revert normal.All woman follow 2 week 2 month operation , include ultrasound examination , clinical assessment ( bleed pattern resumption menses ) . Theχ2 test use analysis enumeration data . The measurement data comparison group test ANOVA analysis . A probability value &lt; .05 consider statistically significant.All data analysis conduct SPSS software ( version17.0 ; SPSS , Inc , IBM , American ) .</detailed_description>
