	<criteria>1 . Are least 18 year age time inform consent 2 . Have confirm diagnosis MPM follow characteristic : Unresectable disease ( define participant candidate curative surgery ) Epithelial type Have archive tissue sample submit either formalin fix paraffinembedded ( FFPE ) tumor block , 5 15 unstained slide 3 . Have measurable disease Screening compute tomography ( CT ) ( magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) define least 1 lesion great equal 1.5 cm long diameter nonlymph node great equal 1.5 cm shortaxis diameter lymph node serially measurable accord modified RECIST criterion 4 . Have significant medical condition wellcontrolled stable opinion investigator least 30 day prior Day 1 5 . Have ECOG Performance Status 0 1 Screening 6 . Have life expectancy least 3 month , estimate investigator 7 . Have adequate organ reserve determine laboratory test result obtain within 2 week prior Study Day 1 indicate : Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count great equal 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL Serum bilirubin less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( Participants serum bilirubin abnormality great specify limit eligible know Gilberts disease . ) Aspartate aminotransferase less equal 3 x ULN Alanine aminotransferase less equal 3 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase less equal 3 x ULN 8 . Have calculate serum creatinine clearance great equal 45 mL/min use CockcroftGault equation 9 . Participants childbearing potential must surgically sterile consent use highly effective method contraception throughout study period . All female consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal ( amenorrheic least 12 consecutive month , appropriate age group , without know suspected cause ) sterilize surgically ( ie , bilateral tubal ligation , total hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , surgery least 1 month dose ) . If participant childbearing potential neither surgically sterile postmenopausal , highly effective contraceptive measure must start either prior Screening continue throughout entire study period least 6 month last dose chemotherapy least 30 day last dose Test Article ( amatuximab placebo ) administer ( whichever later ) . A highly effective method contraception define one result low failure rate ( ie , le 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly . Periodic abstinence , rhythm method , withdrawal method , condom , diaphragm acceptable method contraception . Women childbearing potential must also refrain egg cell donation 6 month final dose investigational product . 10 . Male participant must successful vasectomy ( confirm azoospermia ) female partner must meet criterion ( ie , childbearing potential practicing highly effective contraception throughout study period 6 month discontinuation chemotherapy 5 week Test Article ( amatuximab placebo ) discontinuation ( whichever later ) . No sperm donation allow study period 90 day Test Article discontinuation . 11 . Be willing able provide write informed consent 12 . Be willing able comply aspect protocol 1 . Have history following : Prior systemic therapy radiotherapy MPM ; local radiotherapy noncurative intent ( ie , prevention instrumenttract recurrence and/or symptom control ) permit Evidence active , invasive malignancy require treatment within past 5 year ; noninvasive cancer history ( carcinomainsitu [ CIS ] resect ) allow 2 . Currently mesothelioma sarcomatous type , mixed histologic disease , malignant peritoneal mesothelioma 3 . Have confirm presence central nervous system metastases 4 . Active viral hepatitis active human immunodeficiency virus infection 5 . Have evidence serious systemic disease , include active bacterial fungal infection , medical condition , opinion investigator ( ) could affect participant 's safety interfere study assessment 6 . Clinically significant heart disease ( eg , congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class 3 4 , angina well controlled medication , myocardial infarction within 6 month ) 7 . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) demonstrate clinically significant arrhythmia ( Note : participant chronic atrial arrhythmia , ie , atrial fibrillation paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia , eligible ) . A clinically significant ECG abnormality , include mark prolonged QT/QTc interval ( eg , repeated demonstration QTc interval great 500 m ) . 8 . Have know intolerance Test Article ( ie , document hypersensitivity AE prior monoclonal antibody therapy , amatuximab excipients ) 9 . Pregnant and/or lactate female exclude ; negative betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [ BhCG ] ) require Screening , separate local assessment require negative screening pregnancy test obtain 72 hour first dose Test Article 10 . Have medical condition opinion investigator ( ) would preclude participant 's participation clinical study 11 . Are scheduled debulking surgery study 12 . Are currently enrol another clinical study use investigational drug device within 30 day ( 5 x halflife investigational drug/device , whichever long ) precede inform consent</criteria>
