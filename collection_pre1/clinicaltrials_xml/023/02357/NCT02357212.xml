	<brief_title>Early Invasive Versus Conservative Therapy Women With Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim enroll 1,000 woman present AcuteCoronarySyndorme ( ACS ) . Patients identify screen woman admit chest pain , woman positive cardiac enzyme operative procedure . After receive permission approach potential subject , train delegate study personnel present study patient . The informed consent process complete study coordinator , PI co-investigator . The patient procedure , risk benefit explain offered time read review informed consent form . They give adequate time ask question , consult family member primary physician . Specifically , write informed consent obtain emergency department cardiology ward/unit patient sedated/in catheterization laboratory . . When patient consent participate study , treatment assignment randomly determine open seal envelope contain one two treatment strategy . The blinding envelope create Biostatistics group seal . Once informed write consent obtain ( see accompany flow chart ) , patient randomly assign early invasive therapy versus conservative management . All patient administer aspirin 325 mg , clopidogrel 600 mg , atorvastatin 80 mg. Anti-thrombin therapy ( unfractionated heparin bivalirudin accord physician discretion ) administer intravenously . If anti-thrombin therapy administer prior randomization , agent continue catheterization titrate necessary achieve desire effect . Patients assign early invasive strategy undergo coronary angiography within 48 hour percutaneous coronary intervention coronary artery bypass grafting perform soon possible initial hospitalization deem appropriate . The choice intervention surgery determine operator accord coronary anatomy consistent current practice guideline . For example , disease leave main trunk , multi-vessel disease would generally expect referred surgical revascularization . Patients undergo percutaneous coronary intervention receive glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor ( i.e . abciximab bolus intra-coronary intra-venous route ( 0.25 mg per kg ) , follow infusion ( 0.125 µg per kg per minute 12 hour ) . Upfront use glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor discourage . Eptifibatide tirofiban use instead abciximab accord operator discretion . Elective percutaneous coronary intervention non-culprit vessel , either study arm , take place sometime index procedure goal achieve complete revascularization . Such staged procedure adjudicate urgent need revascularization . Patients assign conservative management treat anti-anginal medication , well aspirin , clopidogrel , atorvastatin , guideline recommend medicine . Anti-thrombin therapy continue 48 hour . Conservative therapy continue time , unless patient refractory angina , hemodynamic electrical instability , leave ventricular dysfunction ( left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 45 % ) , significant ischemia predischarge stress test . Patients echocardiogram determine leave ventricle function . Stress test perform adenosine SPECT leave ventricular dysfunction echocardiography . Patients high risk finding , refractory chest pain , leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 45 % , large burden ischemia stress test remain hospital undergo cardiac catheterization . Patients group treat lifelong aspirin , 12 month clopidogrel , addition atorvastatin guideline recommend therapy . A short duration clopidogrel recommend select case accord treat physician discretion . Specific data acquisition : Protected health information access practitioner normally involved patient 's care hospitalization . Research demographic obtain research coordinator interview patient chart review . After hospital discharge , research coordinator contact patient specify interval determine endpoint met . Evidence endpoint occur would require additional supplemental chart review research coordinator . Patient demographic : age , height , weight , body mass index , medication randomization , pertinent medical/surgical/family/social history : example hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , current tobacco use , history : prior myocardial infarction , percutaneous coronary intervention coronary artery bypass grafting . This data gather research coordinator patient report chart review . Procedural : Duration ischemic symptom onset randomization , electrocardiographic change , elevate cardiac biomarkers , elevate NT-pro-BNP , procedural success define Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow 3 , drug-eluting stent use , glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use , intra-procedural activate clotting time , closure device , sheath size , micropuncture access .</detailed_description>
