	<brief_summary>The purpose research study compare extent resection ( EOR ) patient nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma undergo transsphenoidal surgery use microsurgical technique patient undergone surgery fully endoscopic technique . Another goal compare surgical complication , endocrine outcome , visual outcomes , length surgery , length hospital stay , readmission rate two transsphenoidal surgery technique . This observational data collection study experimental procedure experimental medicine . Endonasal transsphenoidal removal pituitary tumor unique procedure little information compare two surgical technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment choice patient symptomatic nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma transsphenoidal surgery improve vision decompression optic chiasm , prevent development endocrine dysfunction , treat neurological symptom headache cranial neuropathy cause tumor . The widely accepted surgical technique microscopic transsphenoidal surgery , operate microscope use surgeon provide surgical visualization nasal speculum use maintain operative corridor . [ 1-4 ] Recently , fully endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery , surgical visualization achieve use endoscope , adopt many pituitary surgeon technique offer superior panoramic angle visualization surgical target may permit great tumor resection . [ 5-10 ] There vigorous debate neurosurgical community relative merit microscopic endoscopic technique . Proponents endoscopic technique argue superior visualization permit aggressive tumor resection well preservation normal pituitary gland . Proponents microscopic technique argue permit short operative time , result similar surgical outcome , low complication rate . Despite adoption fully endoscopic surgery many surgeon , prospective study compare extent tumor resection ( EOR ) microscopic endoscopic approach . Numerous retrospective study establish efficacy approach , study present comparative data . [ 11-13 ] Recently , McLaughlin et al . noted addition endoscopy microscopic pituitary surgery enhances tumor removal , particularly patient tumor great 20 mm diameter . [ 14 ] This study raise intrigue possibility certain subgroup patient ( e.g . patient large tumor ) may benefit endoscopic surgery . In patient small tumor cavernous sinus invasion , others show technique achieve similar EOR . [ 15 ] That endoscopy may permit complete tumor resection testable hypothesis .</detailed_description>
