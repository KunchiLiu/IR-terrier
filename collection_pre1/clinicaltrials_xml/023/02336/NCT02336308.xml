	<brief_summary>Burn-related pain severe often difficult manage . Healthcare worker struggle keep burn patient comfortable , especially patient undergo dress change burn wound skin since procedure often cause severe pain . Patients burn wound frequently require high dos opioids ( narcotic ) calming ( anxiolytic ) agent extent clinician must weigh risk associate dos achieve adequate analgesia comfort . The big risk over-sedation cause breathing trouble . Inadequate pain control procedures heighten pain perception , anxiety , fear surround experience may lead patient experience additional psychological disorder like depression , acute stress disorder ( ASD ) , post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Therefore , therapeutic option well management pain anxiety procedure need identify . This study address whether addition ketamine dress change improve patient ' pain control comfort whether lead favorable psychological outcome . The study design compare ketamine placebo add usual care ( opioids anxiolytic ) dress change . The main outcome study amount opioid anxiolytic agent group receive procedure ; presence pain-related anxiety shortly procedures ; blood marker stress procedure ; presence depression , anxiety stress disorder prior discharge . This study assess whether early administration ketamine reduces pain anxiety prevent need high dos opioids anxiolytic . A total 30 patient enrol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Double-Blind Study Placebo vs. Ketamine For Use During Dressing Changes Critically Ill Burn Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Methods A . Outcome Measure ( ) : This randomize , double-blind study design evaluate effectiveness ketamine versus placebo addition usual care use dressing change 30 thermally injured subject . The primary outcome opioid benzodiazepine requirement surround dressing change , pain profile , hemodynamic change , pain-related anxiety score relate ketamine use versus placebo . Secondary outcome exploratory evaluate inflammatory marker , IL-1β IL-6 , presence regard ketamine versus placebo well association ASD , depression , PTSD . B . Description Population Enrolled : The study methodology follow CONSORT guideline . A total 30 critically ill burn patient total body surface area ( TBSA ) ≥ 5 % require dressing change perform hydro procedure room enrol 18-24 month 9-bed burn-trauma ICU ( B-TICU ) UCH . Patients enrol receive dressing change burn treatment room patient alert orient , sedate , able communicate health care provider respond question regard perception pain anxiety . Subjects randomize double-blind manner receive placebo ( n=15 ) ketamine ( n=15 ) addition usual care use , , dress change . C. Assessment Outcomes Primary Hypothesis 1 : Adjunctive ketamine safely reduce short-term pain anxiety surround dress change event conscious thermally injured patient compare usual care . Aim 1a : Comparatively evaluate opioid benzodiazepine requirement , , dress change placebo ketamine . When subject schedule dressing change burn treatment room , subject 's active medication list evaluate analgesic , anxiolytic , neuropathic medication . Every hour , start 4 hour prior begin dress change procedure , drug , dose , route record administered medication . Opioid medication convert fentanyl equivalent benzodiazepine medication convert midazolam equivalent fentanyl midazolam represent commonly administer agent . Documentation continue every hour 4 hour end procedure . This repeat every dressing change . Aim 1b : Comparatively evaluate patient ' perceive pain level , , dress change placebo ketamine . When subject schedule dressing change burn treatment room , subject ask rate pain score use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) [ anchored 0 represent pain 10 bad pain patient ever experience ] . The VAS instrument administer investigator designee within 4-12 hour prior dress change procedure . Subjects ask rate pain use VAS within 4-12 hour end procedure . This repeat every dressing change . Aim 1c : Comparatively evaluate patient ' pain-related anxiety surround dress change placebo ketamine . When subject schedule dressing change burn treatment room , subject ask rate pain-related anxiety score use Burn Specific Pain Anxiety Scale ( BSPAS ) . The BSPAS instrument administer investigator designee within 4-12 hour prior dress change procedure . Subjects ask rate pain-related anxiety score use BSPAS within 4-12 hour end procedure . The BSPAS 5-item assessment question relate : feeling worry , emotion surround dressing change , anticipation anxiety relate pain surround procedure , feeling `` edge '' due experience pain . Each question score visual analog line start 0 end 100 , two anchor reference subject . This tool design detect anticipatory anxiety burn patient use study ability distinguish acute anxiety burn patient related dressing change . This repeat every dressing change . Aim 1d : Comparatively evaluate occurrence hypo- hypertension , tachycardia , neurologic agitation / disassociation , over-sedation , need open-label ketamine placebo ketamine . Blood pressure heart rate monitor hourly four hour , , end procedure . Hypotension define systolic blood pressure ≤90 mmHg decrease systolic blood pressure ≥40 mmHg , hypertension define systolic blood pressure ≥180 mmHg increase systolic blood pressure ≥40 mmHg , tachycardia define heart rate ≥120 beats/minute increase ≥20 beats/minutes . The administration fluid boluses vasopressor therapy also record . It anticipate therapy require . The Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ( RASS ) score use determine neurologic disassociation ( RASS score +2 +4 indicate agitation combative ) over-sedation ( RASS score -3 -5 indicate moderate deep sedation ) . The RASS score perform routine care every hour record four hour end procedure . Open label ketamine may administer burn ICU physician patient receive dos study drug subject report pain score ≥7 ( 10 ) despite administration ≥400 mcg fentanyl equivalent ( represent 75th percentile fentanyl require medication usage evaluation conduct UCH ) RASS score -4 -5 , indicate level sedation deep enough warrant caution administer additional dos opioids anxiolytic . The use open label ketamine record comparatively assess . Secondary Hypothesis 2 : Adjunctive ketamine administration alters cytokine level , specifically interleukins IL-1β IL-6 , dress change compare usual care . Aim 2a : Comparatively evaluate magnitude change serum concentration IL-1β IL-6 level dress change placebo ketamine . When subject schedule dressing change burn treatment room , venous blood sample 10 mL obtain indwell catheter 4-12 hour procedure evaluate level IL-1β IL-6 serum . Blood sample centrifuge 15 minute 3000rpm plasma immediately separate stored -80°F . Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) use determine IL-1β IL-6 concentration subject complete study . Secondary Hypothesis 3 : Ketamine use adjunct burn dress change reduces incidence long-term psychometric outcome compare usual care . Aim 3a : Comparatively evaluate incidence ASD placebo ketamine dressing change . Within seven day final dressing change procedure , investigator facilitate completion Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Scale ( SASRS ) . The SASRS instrument administer investigator designee . The SASRS consist 30 item . Ten question related dissociation , six re-experiencing trauma , six anxiety increase arousal , six avoidance trauma , two impairment functioning . The question modify pertain specific event ( i.e . burn dress change ) . Each question score 0 5 . Also , instrument contains additional three question specifically associate ASD . They involve event description , traumatic event , long subject severe symptom relation event . In order positive score ASD , subject must score 3 high least three dissociative symptom least one symptom follow : re-experiencing , increased anxiety arousal , avoidance , impairment functioning . This scale demonstrate reliability validity use burn-related study assess ASD positive result . Aim 3b : Comparatively evaluate incidence anxiety depression placebo ketamine prior hospital discharge . Within 3-7 day prior project date discharge , investigator designee administer Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) . The HADS instrument administer investigator designee . The HADS consist 14 question , seven anxiety seven depression . Each item score 0 3 , cut-off cumulative score 11 subscales indicative anxiety depression . This score tool use 30 year , possess excellent reliability validity , avoids reliance condition also common somatic symptom illness fatigue , insomnia , hypersomnia . Aim 3c : Comparatively evaluate incidence PTSD placebo ketamine prior hospital discharge . Within 3-7 day prior project date discharge , investigator designee administer Impact Events Scale-Revised ( IES-R ) . The IES-R instrument administer investigator designee . The IES-R evaluates subjective distress cause traumatic event use assess manifestation PTSD . It diagnostic posse excellent reliability validity manifestation PTSD . The IES-R three subscales ( eight item intrusion , eight item avoidance , six item hyperarousal ) . Each item score four point scale : 0 = `` , '' 1 = `` little bit , '' 2 = `` moderately often , '' 3 = `` quite bit , '' 4 = `` extremely often . '' The total score subscale may average cumulative score 30 indicative presence PTSD . Aim 3d : Assess possible association cytokine level ASD , anxiety , depression , PTSD . Statistical association IL-1β IL-6 value SASRS , HADS , IES-R investigate . C. Data Analysis Plan : A total 30 subject evaluate ( 15 study group ) base power 0.8 significance level 0.05 . Data obtain medication usage evaluation UCH use estimate mean standard deviation change cumulative fentanyl equivalent dose four hour period vs. dress change . Using standard deviation 130mcg , 12 subject require study group show desire difference 150mcg group compare magnitude change fentanyl dose vs. procedure . While dress change evaluate , assume analysis one dressing change per subject occur . An additional three subject per study group enrol ensure total 24 subject assume upper limit 20 % possible drop-out rate . Thirty subject provide power 0.8 significance level 0.05 detect 50 % decline patient report moderate pain ( VAS BSPAS ) anxiety ( SASRS ) assume baseline rate exceed 80 % . Mean , median , standard deviation , interquartile range determine continuous data . The primary analysis include randomize subject base intent treat regardless whether complete study . Additional analysis conduct base subject complete protocol ( i.e . withdrawn study prior complete protocol receive open-label ketamine exclude ) complete treatment . Statistical analysis continuous data group use student T test Mann-Whitney U parametric nonparametric data , respectively . Statistical analysis continuous data within study group use pair student T test Wilcoxan Rank test parametric nonparametric data , respectively . Statistical analysis proportion use Chi-square test Fisher 's Exact test parametric nonparametric data , respectively , appropriate correction small sample size . Pearson product Spearman Rank Order use correlation analysis IL-1β IL-6 result psychometric scoring tool . The study design investigate primary hypothesis relate specific aim . All secondary hypothesis exploratory investigate consistency data analysis interpret cautiously .</detailed_description>
