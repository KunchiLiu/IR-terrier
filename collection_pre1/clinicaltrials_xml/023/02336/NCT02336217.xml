	<brief_title>Glycemic Emergency Management ( GEM ) ; An App Rapid Response Hypoglycemic Hyperglycemic Situations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study determine impact GEM ( glycemic emergency management device-app ) reduce frequency severity hypoglycemia episode person diabetes . Other objective include : determine whether GEM system lead improve glucose control ( measure HbA1c ) participation pilot , determine whether GEM use cost effective solution reduce ER urgent care visit , determine difference ADDQOL score person function GEM system placebo device . The Study hypothesis follow : There wil significant difference number hypoglycemic event , ER urgent care visit , A1C , well quality life measure ADDQOL score person diabetes function GEM device smart phone device instal smart phone . The purpose pilot study determine utility application help improve outcome reduce urgent care ER visit well improve A1C quality life person diabetes . This approach may paradigm shift rapidly detect , monitoring , intervene manage acute diabetic complication hypoglycemia , hyperglycemia diabetic ketoacidosis . Spiraling health care cost major concern economy US . New measure introduce Affordable Care Act improve efficiency health care delivery system . There emphasis preventive health care service . Our study step direction since utilizes exist smart phone technology convert medical device invaluable help patient .</detailed_description>
