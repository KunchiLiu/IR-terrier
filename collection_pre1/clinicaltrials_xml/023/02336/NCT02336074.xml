	<brief_summary>This study two-arm prospective 1:1 randomise control trial comparing : Arm A : cART preferably include raltegravir ( combination ART cART - control ) Arm B : cART preferably include raltegravir ( cART ) plus ChAdV63.HIVconsv ( ChAd ) prime MVA.HIVconsv ( MVA ) boost vaccine ; follow 28-day course vorinostat ( 10 dos total ) . We hypothesise intervention primary HIV infection confer significant reduction latent HIV reservoir compare cART alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design two-arm , open label randomise study . Eligible participant recruit two participant cohort ( Cohort I - Recently diagnose Cohort II - Previously diagnose HIV ) . All participant receive combination ART ( cART ) duration intervention phase study ( Cohort I : 42 week , Cohort II : 18 week ) . In patient meet criterion randomisation ( eligibility assess week 22/screening ) , participant either continue cART receive intervention consist two anti-HIV vaccine separate 8 week follow 10 dos HDACi , vorinostat , addition cART . We hypothesise prime-boost vaccination result generation vaccine induce HIV specific CTLs recognise HDACi-activated cell HIV reservoir destroy . The net effect great reduction HIV reservoir define HIV total DNA CD4+ T-cells cART+vaccine+HDACi compare cART alone . Our strategy entirely different previous therapeutic vaccination approach largely unsuccessful . Immunological prim conserve HIV protein drive CD8+ T-lymphocyte recognition latently-infected cell render immunogenic HDACi . We anticipate viral antigen express latently-infected cell unable adapt , escape , immune response express directly chromosomal DNA , avoid step viral life-cycle facilitate immune-driven adaptation . We choose prime-boost immunisation strategy recombinant replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus modify vaccinia Ankara vector , bear conserve HIV antigens ; product show induce high titre HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells . In addition , vaccine drive immune response conserve region virus may well preserve individual PHI . Primary HIV Infection ( PHI ) unique period HIV proviral reservoir small chronic disease , likely homogeneous later stage disease hence susceptible immunological elimination . This provide opportunity use vaccine re-direct HIV-specific immune response towards genetically fragile region viral proteome . Immunisation PHI result potent immune response ART initiate PHI preserve CD4 function early ART-mediated viral suppression limit viral diversification , reduce chance immune escape . The key reason conduct trial patient treat PHI , patient , early sustain course ART start early infection may induce state viral remission therapy stop without rebound viraemia . This notably report VISCONTI cohort 'post-treatment control ' identify 15.6 % select individual . Data group others show whilst rapid decline measure total HIV DNA follow ART initiation 6 month seroconversion plateaus approximately 2 year diagnosis acute infection . Hence randomisation individual start immediate ART acute infection comparable level HIV reservoir start treatment within similar timeframe , remain suppressive therapy 2 year initiation . Furthermore , since primary endpoint RIVER study design compare total HIV DNA two arm randomisation post-randomisation week 16 &amp; 18 Cohorts I II comparable . We hypothesise combination HDACi immunisation cART-suppressed PHI significantly impact HIV reservoir . 1 . Patients Cohort I - Recently diagnose receive combination antiretroviral therapy design reduce plasma viral load quickly possible , hence rationale preferred inclusion raltegravir , integrase inhibitor . Both cohort treat PHI , may restrict size reservoir compare people initiate ART later stag HIV infection . Cohort II - Previously diagnose participant screen Cohort I maintain ART throughout study . The ART regimen preferably combination include raltegravir , hypothetically , vorinostat induce viral transcription integrase inhibitor may protect uninfected cell . However , evidence support hypothesis key inclusion criterion must continuation virally suppressive ART regimen throughout study . 2 . The prime-boost vaccination design enhance kill capacity cytotoxic T cell . This must give HDACi order prime boost maximal HIV-specific T-cell response recognise activate viral antigen expression reservoir cell . 3 . The HDACi design cause viral transcription latently infected cell ; activate reservoir , presence enhance kill capacity CD8+ T cell , result kill cell previously harbour latent virus , lead reduction reservoir . This exact combined approach treat PHI never previously use , hypothesise 50 % reduction proviral DNA ( 'reservoir ' ) , 'proof-of-concept ' study , randomise vaccine-HDACi intervention compare receive antiretroviral therapy alone .</detailed_description>
