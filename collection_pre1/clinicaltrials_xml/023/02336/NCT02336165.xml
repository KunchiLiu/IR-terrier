	<brief_summary>This open-label , non-randomized , multicenter Phase 2 study MEDI4736 three non-comparative cohort : Cohort A : 37 subject newly diagnose unmethylated MGMT GBM receive MEDI4736 every 2 week combination standard radiotherapy . Cohort B : 30 bevacizumab-naïve subject recurrent GBM receive MEDI4736 every 2 week monotherapy . Cohort B2 : 32 bevacizumab-naïve subject recurrent GBM receive MEDI4736 every 2 week + bevacizumab every 2 week ( 10 mg/kg ) . Cohort B3 : 32 bevacizumab-naïve subject recurrent GBM receive MEDI4736 every 2 week + bevacizumab every 2 week ( 3 mg/kg ) . Cohort C : 17 bevacizumab-refractory subject recurrent GBM receive MEDI4736 every 2 week combination continue bevacizumab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Under circumstance , immune system may control even eliminate tumor . MEDI4736 experimental antibody make laboratory . Antibodies stimulate immune system develop treatment human cancer . The idea behind develop type experimental drug stimulate immune system could different way prevent cancer growth kill cancer cell . This study also evaluate much MEDI4736 blood various time , whether immune system become activate follow treatment effect treatment cancer . In subject newly diagnose GBM ( Cohort A ) , MEDI4736 administer standard treatment include radiation follow surgery . The idea add MEDI4736 standard radiation radiation cause cell death release tumor proteins increase immune activity MEDI4736 . Subjects recurrent GBM never treat Avastin ( Cohort B ) , receive MEDI4736 alone . In Cohorts B2 B3 , subject recurrent GBM never treat Avastin receive MEDI2736 combination standard low dose Avastin respectively . Subjects recurrent GBM currently progress Avastin ( Cohort C ) , continue receive Avastin combination MEDI4736 . Avastin another type antibody prevent growth blood vessel fee tumor . Despite Avastin approve FDA cancer base tumor response , essentially patient eventually progress due resistance . The idea treat cancer MEDI4736 , without Avastin , identify alternative treatment option cancer , stimulate immune system prevent cancer growth .</detailed_description>
