	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Oral Ceritinib Patients With ALK-positive NSCLC Metastatic Brain and/or Leptomeninges</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 160 patient diagnose ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC ( accord 7th edition AJCC [ American Joint Committee Cancer ] Cancer Staging Manual ) active lesion brain and/or diagnose leptomeningeal carcinomatosis include study , approximately 40 patient Arm 1 Arm 2 , approximately 30 patient Arms 3 Arm 4 , approximately 20 patient Arm 5 . Additional patient may enrol Arm 4 achieve approximately 60 patient Arms 3 4 together ( i.e . ALKi naïve patient ) , enrollment rate Arm 3 slow . - Arm 1 include patient metastases brain without evidence leptomeningeal carcinomatosis , previously treat radiation brain prior exposure ALKi . - Arm 2 include patient metastases brain without evidence leptomeningeal carcinomatosis , previously untreated radiation brain prior exposure ALKi . - Arm 3 include patient metastases brain without evidence leptomeningeal carcinomatosis , previously treat radiation brain prior exposure ALKi . - Arm 4 include patient metastases brain without evidence leptomeningeal carcinomatosis , previously untreated radiation brain prior exposure ALKi - Arm 5 include patient leptomeningeal carcinomatosis without evidence active lesion baseline Gadoliniumenhanced brain MRI . Note : Previous treatment ALK inhibitor crizotinib allow Arms 1 , 2 , 5 . Ceritinib administer orally daily dose 750 mg ( five 150 mg capsule ) continuous dose schedule . The treatment period start Cycle 1 Day 1 . Complete tumor assessment include gadolinium enhance brain MRI repeat Week 8 ( Cycle 3 Day 1 ) every 8 week ( i.e . every 2 cycle ) thereafter earlier clinically indicate . Safety evaluation include ( S ) AEs , physical examination , vital sign , ECGs , laboratory parameter WHO performance status . Blood CSF sample PK also collect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis metastatic NSCLC accord 7th edition AJCC Cancer Staging Manual . In addition , NSCLC must harbor ALK rearrangement , assess use FDA approve Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit ( Abbott Molecular Inc. ) test score algorithm ( include positivity criterion ) . If documentation ALK rearrangement describe locally available , test confirm ALK rearrangement must perform Novartis designated central laboratory . Patients must wait central laboratory result ALK rearrangement status initiate treatment ceritinib At least one extracranial measurable lesion define RECIST 1.1 . A previously irradiate site lesion may count target lesion clear sign progression since irradiation . Patients may may neurological symptom must able swallow retain oral medication . Be neurologically stable within least 1 week prior first dose study drug . Patients may receive prior chemotherapy , crizotinib ( ALK inhibitor allow ) , biologic therapy investigational agent . Patients must recover toxicity relate prior anticancer therapy grade ≤ 1 ( CTCAE v 4.03 ) . Patients grade alopecia allow enter study . Patient life expectancy ≥ 6 week . Patient WHO performance status 02 . Patients Arm 1 4 must also meet follow inclusion criterion : Patients must active brain metastasis NSCLC , confirm Gadoliniumenhanced MRI without concomitant leptomeningeal carcinomatosis . Dose steroid must stable 5 day baseline brain MRI . Patients Arm 5 must also meet follow inclusion criterion : Patients must diagnose leptomeningeal carcinomatosis . Patients need whole brain radiation control brain metastasis . Patients eligible unless treat brain lesion progressive new brain lesion observe since post whole brain radiation therapy MRI . Planning brain local treatment ( include limit surgery , stereotactic radiosurgery , whole brain radiation , intrathecal chemotherapy ) follow administration first dose study drug . Patient concurrent malignancy history malignant disease NSCLC diagnose and/or require therapy within past 3 year . Exceptions exclusion include follow : completely resect basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , completely resect carcinoma situ type . Patient impairment GI function GI disease may significantly alter absorption ceritinib ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome ) . Patient receive unstable increase dos corticosteroid . Patient severe , acute , chronic medical condition include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality opinion investigator may increase risk associate study participation , may interfere interpretation study result . Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply .</criteria>
