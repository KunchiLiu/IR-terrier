	<brief_summary>Although pain extensively study ICU patient , study focus dyspnea , experience 50 % mechanically ventilated patient . The purpose present study determine whether dyspnea intensive care unit patient associate high length stay ICU high incidence post traumatic stress disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Dyspnea Patients Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient continuously expose various unpleasant sensation many source discomfort . If , grow attention give detection treatment pain , little attention give dyspnea . However , grow evidence suggest dyspnea frequent severe mechanically ventilated ICU patient . In mechanically ventilated ICU patient , dyspnea independently associate anxiety mechanical ventilation . Indeed , optimization ventilator setting alleviate dyspnea 35 % patient . Various argument suggest dyspnea contributes dark experience ICU participate genesis post traumatic stress disorder . In addition , dyspnea associate long duration mechanical ventilation . Large multicentre study however lack . The aims present multicentre study 1 ) quantify prevalence dyspnea large population ICU mechanically ventilate patient , 2 ) examine link level dyspnea occurrence adverse event ICU , 3 ) determine whether dyspnea intensive care unit patient associate high length stay ICU high incidence post traumatic stress disorder associate symptom .</detailed_description>
