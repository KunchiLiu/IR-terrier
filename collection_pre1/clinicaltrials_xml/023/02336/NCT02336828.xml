	<brief_summary>This study validate use modify early warning score ( MEWS ) adult oncology ward predictor 7 day mortality intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission . It expect either MEWS score ≥4 change score ≥2 initial reading associate increase risk death ICU admission , regard MEWS Alarm . If MEWS proof reliable alternative tool , early diagnosis aggressive management life-threatening complication oncology patient , result dramatic improvement overall survival rate . This prospective , single centre , observational , cohort study . Objective study investigate ability Modified Early Warning Score ( MEWS ) predict 7 day mortality adult clinical oncology ward patient . The alternate hypothesis study significant difference 7 day mortality adult oncology ward patient MEWS Alarm adult oncology ward patient without MEWS alarm . The null hypothesis significant difference 7 day mortality adult oncology ward patient MEWS Alarm adult oncology ward patient without MEWS alarm . The primary outcome measure study number patient die within 7 day MEWS Alarm ( 7 day mortality ) . The secondary outcome measure study number patient admit ICU within 7 day MEWS Alarm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct 26-bedded clinical oncology ward , university teaching hospital Hong Kong Island Hong Kong . The patient consecutively admitted clinical oncology ward 18 January 7 February 2015 include study , patient count 7 day mortality 7 day ICU admission set reach MEWS Alarm . The patient incomplete MEWS discharge data exclude . A pilot study conduct 13 July time 0am 18 July time 0am , 2014 , 41 patient admit consecutively clinical oncology ward study period . 10 exclude incomplete MEWS chart , leave 31 patient pilot study . 18 male 13 female . 1 patient transfer ICU second day admission , MEWS score increase 3 initial . Six patient 7 day mortality MEWS alarm one patient 7 day mortality without MEWS alarm study period . According sample size formula calculator , estimate sample 171 patient 18 January 7 February 2015 . MEWS standard nursing routine measurement calculate sum five physiological parameter : systolic blood pressure , pulse rate , respiratory rate , body temperature level consciousness . The calculated MEWS score chart observation chart sheet . Nursing staff routinely collect MEWS score admission every day hospital stay . The date admission ICU , date death also collect . In detail , blood pressure pulse rate measure electronically ( Dinamap Pro 200 Critikon Vital Signs Monitor , U.S.A ) . The respiratory rate count one minute . The tympanic temperature record ( ThermoScan , Type 6014 , Braun , Germany ) , level consciousness base AVPU score : A 'alert ' , V 'response verbal ' , P 'response pain ' U 'unresponsive ' ) . The MEWS score countercheck doctor doctor ' assessment admission doctor ' round everyday . An ethical approval acquire CUHK Queen Mary Hospital Clinical Research Ethics Committee . All participant involve study experience harm . Potential participant give write information regard nature study assurance confidentiality data collect . Written Consent sign . All report copy collect keep confidential . Patient choose whether study . If volunteer study , may withdraw time without consequence kind loss benefit . For data analysis , 7 day mortality reach MEWS Alarm compare one without reach MEWS Alarm Chi-Squared Test . The relationship MEWS mortality statistically significant P value low 0.05 . Besides , method data analysis use ICU admission without reach MEWS Alarm .</detailed_description>
