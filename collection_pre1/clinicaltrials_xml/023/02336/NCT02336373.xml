	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) , specifically hemoglobin SC disease ( HbSC ) , subtype sickle cell disease typically high hemoglobin milder later disease complication . Sickle cell disease disorder red blood cell ( RBCs ) abnormally shape . This result painful episode , serious infection , damage body organ . One medication use treat sickle cell disease hydroxyurea . Hydroxyurea therapy offer significant benefit infant , child , adolescent sickle cell anemia . These include reduction frequency pain crisis acute chest syndrome ( inflammation lung ) . Hydroxyurea give many HbSC patient HbSC patient include large clinical trial use test hydroxyurea SCD , less known HbSC patient respond hydroxyurea . The purpose research study see hydroxyurea , medication give many child common type sickle cell , homozygous sickle mutation ( HbSS ) , help child HbSC . The investigator see help give questionaire medication start , every two month clinic visit . The questionaire , call Pediatric Quality Life Inventory ( PedsQL™ ) Sickle Cell Disease Module version 3.0 , measure quality life . The investigator also see hydroxyurea change laboratory test number , blood thickness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To eligible participate study , patient must HbSC disease , experience sickle cell disease related complication , score 80 low PedsQL™ Sickle Cell Disease Module version 3.0 . This questionnaire offer patient HbSC see clinic consent study . If patient sexually active , offered birth control . If patient chooses initiate effective birth control , test schedule vist urine pregnancy test . If patient becomes pregnant remove study . The maximum time patient study 12 month start hydroxyurea therapy , option participate 2 year observation study follow end study . Patients assess clinic every two month start treatment . Hydroxyurea start 10 mg/kg/day , increase 5 mg/kg/day eight week interval need reach maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . The common side effect drug drop infection fight cell , white blood cell , medication start low dose dose increase safe . Patients ask allow investigator review information medical record start study , throughout study . If patient would like participate two year follow-up , record review period well .</detailed_description>
