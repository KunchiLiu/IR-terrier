	<brief_summary>The study plan treat least 60 pediatric subject , male female , age 2 month 17 year inclusive acute Graft versus Host Disease ( aGVHD ) follow allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) fail respond treatment systemic corticosteroid therapy . Subjects may Grades C D aGVHD involve skin , liver and/or gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract Grade B aGVHD involve liver and/or GI tract , without concomitant skin disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Remestemcel-L evaluate pediatric subject acute Graft versus Host Disease ( aGVHD ) follow allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) fail respond treatment systemic corticosteroid therapy .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patient diagnose Grade BD acute GVHD require corticosteroid systemic therapy . The subject may Grade C D aGVHD involve skin , liver , and/or gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract may Grade B aGVHD involve liver and/or GI tract , without concomitant skin disease . Acute GVHD define presence skin rash and/or persistent nausea , vomit , and/or diarrhea and/or cholestasis present context aGVHD likely occur etiology drug rash , enteric infection , hepatotoxic syndrome unlikely rule . 2 . Patient fail respond steroid treatment , failure respond define Grade BD ( IBMTR grade ) acute GVHD show progression within 3 day , improvement within 7 consecutive day , treatment 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalent . 3 . Patient must able treat remestemcelL within 4 day study entry . 4 . Patients persistent GI GVHD manifest diarrhea stool volume &lt; 500 mL/day absence nausea vomit may deem Grade B GVHD cause diarrhea rule ( e.g. , C. difficile cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection , oral magnesium administration ) low stool volume reflect effect fast administration narcotic antidiarrheal medication . 5 . Patient must adequate renal function define calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min per 1.73 [ 2 ] determine use Schwartz equation : Creatinine clearance ( ml/min per1.73 [ 2 ] = ( height [ cm ] x k ) / ( serum creatinine [ mg/dL ] ) k standard proportionality constant base patient 's gestational age , chronologic age gender . 6 . Patient minimum Karnofsky/Lansky Performance Level least 30 time study entry . 7 . Patient ( legal representative appropriate ) must capable provide write informed consent . 8 . Female patient childbearing potential ( surgically sterile ) must use medically accept method contraception must agree continue use method duration study followup time period . Acceptable method contraception include abstinence , barrier method spermicide , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , steroidal contraceptive ( oral , transdermal , implanted , inject ) conjunction barrier method . 9 . Male patient partner childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method abstinence ) study , include followup time period . 10 . The patient must willing able comply study requirement , remain clinic , willing able return clinic followup evaluation specify protocol study period . 1 . Patient Grade B aGvHD skinonly involvement . 2 . Patient receive second line therapy treat aGVHD prior screen . 3 . Patient receive systemic agent steroid prophylactic agent primary treatment acute GVHD . 4 . Patient show evidence diffuse alveolar hemorrhage active pulmonary disease , likely require 2L oxygen via face mask estimate FiO ( 2 ) 28 % via delivery method order sustain O ( 2 ) saturation 92 % . 5 . Patient underlying current medical psychiatric condition , opinion Investigator , would interfere evaluation subject include limited uncontrolled infection , heart failure , pulmonary hypertension , etc . 6 . Patient receive stem cell agent ( hematopoietic graft ) study participation within 30 day prior study entry . 7 . Patient know allergy bovine porcine product . 8 . Patient receive HSCT transplant solid tumor disease . 9 . Patient prior treatment mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) , include remestemcelL . 10 . Patient show evidence severe hepatic venoocclusive disease ( VOD ) sinusoidal obstruction . 11 . Patient show evidence encephalopathy define change mental status since onset aGVHD . 12 . Patient female pregnant , lactate , plan pregnancy study participation , followup period . 13 . Patient active solid tumor malignancy within last 5 year screen , except cervical carcinoma situ localize prostate cancer nonmelanoma skin cancer definitively treat . 14 . Patient participate interventional clinical trial aGVHD therapeutic agent immunomodulatory drug , within past 30 day within 5 halflives investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) , whichever great . 15 . Patient participate currently participate bone marrow derive autologous allogeneic stem cell gene therapy study . 16 . Patient known hypersensitivity dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) murine bovine protein .</criteria>
