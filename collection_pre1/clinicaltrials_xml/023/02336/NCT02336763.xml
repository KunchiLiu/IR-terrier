	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study give radiation therapy liver patient uveal ( eye ) melanoma specific chromosome loss ( monosomy 3 ) DecisionDx Class 2 therefore likely disease spread eye liver . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Early radiation liver may reduce development tumor liver overall risk disease recurrence .</brief_summary>
