	<brief_summary>Primex 's PGX assay vitro , semi automate assay , intend determination certain gene involve drug metabolism utilize buccal swab . Detection certain genotype use aid selection appropriate medication base individual ' specific genotype use conjunction clinical information . The result test constitute one parameter multicriterion medication selection process , encompass clinical laboratory-based assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The way person respond drug ( include positive negative reaction ) complex trait influence many different gene . Without know gene involve drug response , scientist find difficult develop genetic test could predict person 's response particular drug . Once scientist discover people 's gene show small variation ( change ) nucleotide ( DNA base ) content , changedâ€”genetic test predict drug response possible . Pharmacogenomics science examines inherit variation gene dictate drug response explore way variation use predict whether patient good response drug , bad response drug , response . The Gene super family Cytochrome P450 primarily responsible clearance different drug variation different gene affect metabolism different class drug . In test concentrate gene specific variation gene study best already exist convince data peer review journal . Since one major class drug affect Cytochrome P450 pathway anti-coagulants , also add certain gene involve coagulation variation might additive affect coagulation status patient . Having information aid physician make good decision prescribe dose anti-coagulants . Description Primex PGX Assay : DNA isolate subject buccal swab subject PCR Real Time PCR determination genetic variation detail . After variation determine , know effect variation ( i.e . reduce activity hyperactivity ) report pharmacist effect combination subject medication list use establish clinical significance utility . The physician make decision change medication recommend . If physician make change subject 's medication regimen , 3 month he/she assess change report finding ; hence establishment clinical utility test . Analytical Performance Objectives : Assess reproducibility Primex 's PGX assay sample run replicate 3 , twice day , minimum 5 day . Clinical Performance Evaluation Objectives : Assess clinical performance characteristic Primex 's PGX assay genotype determine different gene CYP450 gene super family gene relate coagulation Life Technology 's QuantSudio 12kFlex open array real time PCR system . There predicate device therefore clinical utility assess predict phenotype number effective change make physician subject 's drug regimen . Acceptance criterion comparison Primex 's PGX assay result clinical change make subject 's drug regimen : The clinical sensitivity specificity Primex 's PGX assay result clinical change make minimum 65 % 90 % , respectively . Results prior drug regimen change Primex 's PGX test provide may use comparative analysis . Investigator Feedback : At conclusion clinical study , investigator assess clinical performance characteristic evaluate acceptability Primex 's PGX assay write report/letter sponsor .</detailed_description>
