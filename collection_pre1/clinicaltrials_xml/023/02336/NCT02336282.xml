	<brief_summary>A common potentially debilitate late effect childhood cancer treatment neurocognitive impairment , frequently domain executive dysfunction , limit educational attainment , employment , quality life . Among survivor childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) SJLIFE cohort , frequency executive function impairment show high 58.8 % , moderate severe impairment high 33.5 % , risk impairment increase time diagnosis . Given potential pervasive impact neurocognitive impairment daily life , intervention direct reduce neurocognitive dysfunction among childhood cancer survivor long-term follow-up need . This study examine potential feasibility efficacy novel intervention improve executive function . Primary Objectives : - To evaluate feasibility home-based intervention use Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) cognitive train adult survivor childhood ALL participate SJLIFE protocol St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( SJCRH ) . Secondary Objectives : - To estimate efficacy tDCS intervention pair cognitive training . - To explore short-term effect tDCS measure executive function among adult survivor childhood ALL participate SJLIFE protocol</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>tDCS form non-invasive brain stimulation potentially useful tool enhance cognitive function . This study use at-home intervention tDCS cognitive training examines potential usefulness improve executive function ALL survivor . Investigators use tDCS apply low electrical current participant 's scalp area brain associate fluent flexible thinking . The current may make area brain work well short period time . During time , participant play computer game design train brain work fluently flexibly . Researchers St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital want see pair electrical stimulation brain game home feasible method improve cognitive ability long-term survivor childhood ALL . In first part study , short-term effect tDCS intervention evaluate clinical setting use randomize cross-over trial . The survivor randomize receive either tDCS intervention Sham day 1 , treatment give day 2 . Neurocognitive testing conduct within two hour complete stimulation day . In second part study , feasibility potential efficacy self-administration tDCS intervention pair cognitive training evaluate 5 week . Research participant teach use mobile tDCS device provide one take home . The device program investigator advance control intensity duration stimulation . The research participant use device twice per week direct . Within two hour complete tDCS session participant complete 20 minute cognitive training use mobile app instal iPad . Neurocognitive test conduct pre- post- intervention .</detailed_description>
