	<brief_summary>Our goal prospect relationship Bisphenol A ( BPA ) exposure ( measure free conjugate form blood urine ) embryo implantation rate ( measure ratio number gestational sacs number transfer embryos ) assist reproductive technology . In order reduce confusion factor , population study limit young woman ( age 28 34 ) , regular menstrual cycle without medical event could affect implantation process</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bisphenol A Exposure , Ovarian Function Assisted Reproductive Technology Outcome .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among various suspected adverse effect BPA human health , study possible effect BPA reproduction limit . Animal vitro study indicate BPA exposure lead disrupt oocyte maturation , E2 suppression early pregnancy loss cause chromosomal abnormality . In woman , study consequence BPA exposure reproduction difficult task since gametogenesis woman spread decade , intra-uterine life meiosis initiated end reproductive period menopause . Recently , decrease survival human foetal oocyte culture vitro presence BPA show suggest vivo exposure foetal life could affect ovarian reserve . Furthermore , negative association urinary BPA level serum peak E2 , oocyte yield blastocyst formation suggest limited population woman perform ART . These result suggest , adulthood , quantity quality human oocyte could affect BPA exposure . The study aim respond question evaluate relationship BPA exposition level embryo implantation rate ( marker oocyte quality ) anti-Mullerian hormon ( AMH ) level ( marker ovarian reserve ) large population young adult woman perform ART . BPA exposure assess two time blood urine : 1° ) ovarian stimulation time ovarian reserve test 2° ) end ovarian stimulation day ovarian puncture IVF .</detailed_description>
