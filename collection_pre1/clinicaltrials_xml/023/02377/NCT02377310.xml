	<brief_summary>Instantaneous wave-free ratio ( iFR™ ) novel non-hyperaemic index functional significance coronary stenosis . Previous study show variable level correlation establish hyperaemic index FFR . In addition propose iFR™ superior diagnostic accuracy compare mean whole cardiac cycle Pd/Pa also use predict FFR . We plan undertake prospective clinical study consecutive patient already undergo FFR assessment cardiac catheterisation laboratory compare ability iFR™ Pd/Pa ( measure use proprietary Volcano system ) predict FFR . We explore level misclassification flow limit disease result use iFR™ rest Pd/Pa employ use either binary cut-off algorithm hybrid decision make protocol . We plan analyse 260 vessel 18 month period . Hyperaemia induce intravenous adenosine ( 140 ug/kg/min ) administer wherever possible via antecubital vein . Intra-coronary nitrate also give line standard care procedure FFR measurement . Final clinical decision follow coronary physiology base steady state FFR .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Title : A comparative study rest Pd/Pa , instantaneous wave-free ratio fractional flow reserve unselected population refer invasive angiography . Instantaneous wave-free ratio ( iFR™ ) novel non-hyperaemic index assess functional significance coronary stenosis without coronary vasodilatation . In previous study compare hyperaemic index FFR variable result . As guide determine need revascularisation employ use dichotomous cut-off without FFR within hybrid strategy lesion intermediate iFR™ value interrogate use FFR . The comparative diagnostic utility iFR™ v rest pressure ( Pd/Pa ) reference FFR uncertain . We plan undertake prospective clinical study consecutive patient undergo clinically-indicated FFR assessment cardiac catheterisation laboratory 30-80 % diameter stenosis quantitative coronary angiography ( QCA ) . We use proprietary ( Volcano ) pressure wire system iFR ™ algorithm order calculate iFR™ Pd/Pa rest hyperemic condition well FFR . The sample size 260 vessel enrolment period 18 month . Hyperaemia induce intravenous adenosine ( 140 ug/kg/min ) administer wherever possible via antecubital vein . Intra-coronary nitrate also give line standard care procedure FFR measurement . Design : In prospective single centre cohort study consecutive patient undergo FFR eligible inclusion . Active Hypothesis : ( 1 ) In comparison FFR strategy , revascularisation decision make use binary cut-off value iFR™ rest Pd/Pa result similar level disagreement . Active Hypothesis : ( 2 ) In comparison FFR strategy , revascularisation decision use hybrid strategy incorporate iFR™ rest Pd/Pa FFR result similar level disagreement . Active Hypothesis ( 3 ) : Compared iFR™ measure resting condition , hyperaemic iFR™ strong correlation FFR . Should case , diagnostic efficiency iFR™ interpret improved pharmacological vasodilatation . The null hypothesis difference diagnostic efficiency iFR™ hyperaemic iFR compare FFR . The clinical decision catheter laboratory align routine care inform available clinical data FFR result . This study conduct independently National Health Service without industry support involvement . Sample size : 260 vessel . Statistical Analysis : Independent analysis complete dataset perform Dr John McClure biostatistician lecturer Institute Cardiovascular Medical Sciences Glasgow . Methods : We measure rest index Pd/Pa iFR™ . Following measure hyperaemic reading include FFR hyperaemic iFR™ ( HiFR ) sequentially use peripherally administer adenosine . Upon completion enrollment produce summary statistic describe demographic procedural data study case . We calculate discriminatory power iFR™ use pre-specified binary cut-off value 0.90 iFR™ 0.92 rest Pd/Pa adenosine zone iFR 0.86-0.93 rest Pd/Pa 0.87-0.94 . We also analyse correlation HiFR FFR</detailed_description>
