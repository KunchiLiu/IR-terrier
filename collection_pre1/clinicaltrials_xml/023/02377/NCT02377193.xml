	<brief_summary>Induction therapy either T-cell deplete polyclonal antibody anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) non-depleting anti-interleukine 2 receptor monoclonal antibody ( anti-CD25 moAb : basiliximab daclizumab ) use prevent acute rejection , especially highly sensitized patient . Both induction therapy regimens different tolerance profile . Infections haematological side-effects frequently report patient receive ATG . The aim pilot study evaluate ATG basiliximab induction therapy de novo sensitize kidney-transplant patient ( incompatible graft rate ≥ 50 % ) without donor specific antibody ( DSAs ) detect Luminex .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute rejection kidney transplantation lead graft loss irreversible acute rejection interstitial fibrosis/ tubular atrophy induce graft loss . Induction therapy either T-cell deplete polyclonal antibody Anti-Thymocyte Globulins ( ATG ) non-depleting anti-interleukine 2 receptor monoclonal antibody ( anti-CD25 moAb : basiliximab daclizumab ) use prevent acute rejection , especially highly sensitized patient . Both induction therapy regimens different tolerance profile . Infections haematological side-effects frequently report patient receive ATG . With respect efficacy , comparison exists induction therapy regimen high risk immunological patient actually define . Within last year , development new immunological screening tool , i.e . Luminex assay , lead good evaluation immunological status candidate kidney transplantation , mainly consider highly sensitize . The aim pilot study evaluate ATG basiliximab induction therapy de novo sensitize kidney-transplant patient ( incompatible graft rate ≥ 50 % ) without Donor Specific Antibodies ( DSAs ) detect Luminex . Maintenance immunosuppressive regimen base combination tacrolimus , mycophenolate sodium steroid . The primary endpoint composite biopsy-proven acute rejection , graft loss , loss follow , death 6 month post-transplant . The secondary endpoint efficacy therapy month 12 posttransplant , safety parameter ( CMV infection , BK virus nephropathy , haematological tolerance , Adverse Events ( AE ) Serious Adverse Events ( SAE ) ) . Our hypothesis basiliximab induction therapy may sufficiently effective prevent acute rejection sensitize patient without DSA . This may reduce post-transplant immunosuppression-induced side-effects .</detailed_description>
