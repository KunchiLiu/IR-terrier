	<brief_summary>The study 's primary objective demonstrate superiority retosiban prolong pregnancy improve neonatal outcome compare placebo . It Phase III , randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , multicenter study conduct approximately 900 female , age 12 45 year , uncomplicated , singleton pregnancy intact membrane preterm labor 24^0/7 33^6/7 week gestation . Eligible maternal subject randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive either retosiban IV infusion placebo IV infusion 48 hour . If previously administer , antenatal corticosteroid treatment administer either ( 1 ) two 12-mg dos betamethasone give intramuscularly 24 hour apart ( 2 ) four 6-mg dos betamethasone administer intramuscularly every 12 hour . A single rescue course antenatal corticosteroid permit antecedent treatment least 7 day prior study enrolment . Investigators discretion use standardized regimen magnesium sulphate , well intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis perinatal group B streptococcal infection . Prior randomization , subject stratify progesterone treatment gestational age . The progesterone stratum consist subject establish progesterone therapy subject establish progesterone therapy Screening . The study comprise 6 phase : Screening , Inpatient Randomized Treatment , Post Infusion Assessment , Delivery , Maternal Post-Delivery Assessment , Neonatal Medical Review . The duration subject 's ( maternal neonatal ) participation study variable dependent gestational age ( GA ) study entry date delivery .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed date write informed consent require prior subject 's participation study performance protocol specific procedure . Adolescents age 12 17 year must provide write agreement participate study accordance applicable regulatory country state requirement . Subjects also ask sign release medical record time consent allow access maternal neonatal record include information delivery infant care well information collect prior consent sign . Females age 12 45 year , uncomplicated , singleton pregnancy intact membrane preterm . Gestational age 24 33 week determine ( 1 ) know fertilization date , either vitro fertilization intrauterine insemination , ( 2 ) last menstrual period confirm early ultrasound prior 24 week gestation , ( 3 ) early ultrasound alone prior 24 week gestation , whichever accurate method available subject . In situation prenatal ultrasound record available time subject present , investigator make every effort obtain record ( either via computer record , directly subject 's primary care obstetrician , via telephone ) . However , case record readily available ( e.g. , hour , holiday ) , within investigator 's discretion use GA base verbal history subject intent get confirmation medical record soon possible . Females must diagnose preterm labor accord follow criterion : ) Regular uterine contraction rate &gt; =4 contraction least 30 second ' duration 30minute interval confirm tocodynamometry least 1 follow , b ) Cervical dilation &gt; =2 centimeter ( cm ) &lt; =4 cm digital cervical examination c ) If &lt; 2 cm dilation digital cervical examination , cervical change consist increase least 25 % effacement 1cm dilation . Current past tocolytic treatment follow : ) Subjects tocolytic treatment initiate prior consent eligible study , b ) Transferred referred subject parenteral magnesium sulfate treatment start Screening eligible provide meet eligibility criterion , c ) Subjects receive prohibit tocolytic study eligible treatment stop randomization provide meet eligibility criterion , ) Subjects historical failure tocolytic treatment previous episode preterm labor current pregnancy eligible provide meet eligibility criterion . Fever temperature &gt; 100.4 degree Fahrenheit ( 38 degree centigrade ) 1 hour &gt; =101 degree Fahrenheit ( 38.3 degree centigrade ) 24 hour prior start study treatment . Women maternalfetal condition potentially necessitate need delivery , preeclampsia fetal compromise . A fetus diagnosis , condition , treatment , factor opinion investigator potential affect confound assessment efficacy safety ( example : nonreassuring fetal status , intrauterine growth restriction , major congenital anomaly ) . Preterm premature rupture membrane . Women confirm suspected contraindication prolongation pregnancy , placental abruption , chorioamnionitis , placenta previa . Evidence polyhydramnios ( AFI &gt; 25 cm ) oligohydramnios ( AFI &lt; 5 cm ) . Women comorbid medical obstetric condition opinion investigator potential complicate pregnancy course outcome , uncontrolled hypertension uncontrolled diabetes ( know , history glycosylated hemoglobin &gt; 8 % time pregnancy ) , compromise safety subject , underlie cardiovascular disorder ( specifically ischemic cardiac disease , congenital heart disease , pulmonary hypertension , valvular heart disease , arrhythmia , cardiomyopathy ) . Women history substance abuse pregnancy urine drug screen positive cocaine , phencyclidine ( PCP ) , methamphetamine , amphetamine . Women combination history screen test result suggestive abuse dependency may potential complicate pregnancy outcome . Women diagnosis , condition , treatment , factor , opinion investigator , potential affect confound assessment efficacy safety . Current active liver biliary disease ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) . History sensitivity investigational product ( IPs ) component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GlaxoSmithKline/ Pharmaceutical Product Development ( GSK/PPD ) medical monitor , contraindicate subject 's participation .</criteria>
