	<brief_summary>Patients severe ischemic hemorrhagic stroke , require mechanical ventilation , particularly bad prognosis . If require long-term ventilation , orotracheal tube need , like intensive care patient , replace short tracheal tube larynx . This call tracheostomy might associate advantage less demand narcotic pain killer , less lesion mouth larynx , good mouth hygiene , safe airway , patient comfort early mobilisation . The best timepoint tracheostomy stroke , however , know . Preliminary data pilot study early tracheostomy patient hemorrhagic ischemic stroke suggest patient may also improve survival long-term functional outcome , large , multicenter clinical trial need confirm finding .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Tracheostomy Ventilated Stroke Patients 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : According United States data National Inpatient Sample , 1.3 % 1.5 million patient ( 20,300 ) hospitalize ischemic stroke 2007-2009 underwent tracheostomy - number tracheostomy perform hemorrhagic stroke unknown . Historically , mechanically ventilated patient ischemic hemorrhagic stroke poor functional outcome , care patient extremely expensive . Effective intervention improve survival , improve functional recovery , decrease cost , increase cost-effectiveness urgently need . Early tracheostomy select medical surgical patient allow dramatically decrease sedation analgesia , associate improved outcome . Preliminary data pilot study early tracheostomy patient hemorrhagic ischemic stroke suggest patient may also improve survival long-term functional outcome , large , multicenter clinical trial need confirm finding . Method : SETPOINT 2 prospective , randomize , control , outcome observer-blinded , multicenter , two-armed , comparative trial . Patients randomize 1:1 either experimental group - undergo percutaneous tracheostomy ( PDT ) soon feasible within 5 day intubation ( `` early tracheostomy '' ) control group ( `` standard care '' group ) , PDT perform day 10 intubation application in-house wean protocol lead successful extubation . Otherwise , difference intensive care treatment intend , participate institution 's standard operating procedure apply ensure uniform management decision field wean , ventilation , analgesia sedation , transfusion , neurological monitoring management . Blinding treatment assignment impossible treat physician , patient legal representative well investigator . However , primary endpoint long-term outcome cause mortality assess trial-independent adjudicator blind time tracheostomy . The study start investigator initiate study conduct limited external funding . Some funding ( 50 000 Euros ) provide third party fund principal investigator foundation provide data management IMBI organizational aspect study . The principal investigator US co-principle investigator-David B. Seder , M.D . ) together apply research fund several foundation medical association December 2016 receive confirmation fund Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( PCORI ) . Based award , additional endpoint ( e.g . neuromonitoring , patient family experience ) add secondary endpoint study . The core version study remain unchanged . There industry funding SETPOINT 2 study . This investigation specific medical product medication .</detailed_description>
