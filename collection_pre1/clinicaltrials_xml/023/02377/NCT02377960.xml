	<brief_title>Check Support -Enhancing Treatment Hypertension Outpatient Care , Multicenter Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Usual blood pressure strongly relate vascular overall mortality high blood pressure globally lead risk factor cardiovascular related disease . It also well establish pharmacologic blood pressure reduction prevents cardiovascular event deaths person hypertension . Today 's physician plenty knowledge multiple effective safety tool treat hypertension still majority patient antihypertensive medication achieve blood pressure target . Poor medication adherence widely accept important factor fail control hypertension even 50 % hypertensive patient quit antihypertensive medication first year medication . Numerous intervention enhance medication adherence develop even though , intervention effective , simple low cost enough carry wide-scale non-research setting still find . Objectives To test whether tailor SMS-text message support combine IMB model-based initiation medication increase proportion patient achieve systolic blood pressure target 12-month follow-up compare usual care . Additional objective include investigate whether intervention effect - Medication adherence - Systolic diastolic blood pressure level - Hypertension-related use health care service - Blood glucose , blood cholesterol , microalbuminuria , creatinine , ECG , body mass index , waist circumference exercise habit , smoke alcohol use - Perceived quality life base line 12-month follow-up - Setting ( physician ) knowing ( participant ) adequate BP target And , besides Detecting participant especially benefit intervention - Analyzing quality quantity self-monitored BP - Assessing whether IMB model-based structured initiation medication use screen non-compliant patient direct resource accurately - Collecting analyze participant ' physician ' feedback future development intervention Study design Pragmatic randomize control multicenter trial . The eight study center group comparable pair randomize function intervention control sit ( 2-cluster design ) .</detailed_description>
