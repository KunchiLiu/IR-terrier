	<brief_summary>This study healthy , adult Japanese woman characterize PK , safety tolerability retosiban therapeutic dos plan evaluate Phase 3 . The PK data compare sub-set Caucasian woman give dose retosiban . This study two cohort , cohort 1 double-blind sponsor-open ( subject investigator blind sponsor unblinded ) , randomize , continuous 48 hour ( h ) infusion study healthy , adult Japanese woman child-bearing potential . Cohort 2 open label continuous retosiban 48 h infusion study Caucasian , adult , healthy woman child bear potential . So , PK compare Japanese woman . Approximately 32 subject enrol . In cohort 1 , approximately 24 subject enrol randomized retosiban placebo ( 2:1 ratio ) 18 woman 12 active , 6 placebo complete subject . In Cohort 2 , 8 subject enrol 6 competed subject . The total duration subject 's involvement part anticipate 6 week ( include 28 day screen period ) .</brief_summary>
