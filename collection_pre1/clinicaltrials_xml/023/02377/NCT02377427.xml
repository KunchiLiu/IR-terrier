	<brief_summary>Mepolizumab humanize immunoglobulin G ( IgG1 ) monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) exhibit dose proportional time-independent pharmacokinetics . The study conduct 2 part . Part A : pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) study conduct support use mepolizumab child age 6 11 year severe eosinophilic asthma characterize PK/PD mepolizumab 40 milligram ( mg ) 100 mg administer subcutaneously depend participant body weight . Part B : It long-term safety / pharmacodynamic phase extend treatment 52 week offer optional basis subject eligible continued treatment . Participants bodyweight &lt; 40 kilogram ( kg ) dose mepolizumab 40 mg participant body weight &gt; =40 kg dose mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneously upper arm thigh Visit 2 ( Week 0 ) . Approximately 40 male female participant age 6 11 year screen achieve approximately 28 eligible participant enter treatment phase allow availability 20 evaluable participant , minimum six participant enrol &lt; 40 kg bodyweight group . The total duration study 22 week include run-in period 1-2 week , treatment period 12 week follow-up phase 8 week . A participant consider complete study participant completes phase study include follow-up phase ( Week 20 [ visit 8 ] ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between 6 11 year age inclusive , time screen . Diagnosis severe asthma , define regional asthma guideline ( i.e. , National Institute Health ( NIH ) , Global Initiative Asthma ( GINA ) , etc . ) , least 12 month prior Visit 1 . If participant naïve study site , participant/guardian must selfreport physician diagnosis asthma investigator must confirm review medical history participant/guardian . Eosinophilic airway inflammation related asthma characterize eosinophilic nature indicate : elevate peripheral blood eosinophil count &gt; =300 cell per microliter ( cells/μL ) demonstrate past 12 month OR elevate peripheral blood eosinophil count &gt; =150/μL visit 1 . A welldocumented requirement regular treatment inhale corticosteroid ( &gt; 200 μg/day fluticasone propionate drug powder inhaler [ DPI ] equivalent daily ) 12 month prior Visit 1 without maintenance oral corticosteroid ( OCS ) . The ICS dose represent medium high dose child age 611 year age [ GINA , 2015 ] . Current treatment additional controller medication least 3 month document failure past 12 month additional controller medication least 3 successive month . [ e.g. , longacting beta2agonist ( LABA ) , leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRA ) , theophylline . ] Forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) : Persistent airflow obstruction either Visit 1 Visit 2 ( FEV1 perform prior first dose study medication ) indicate : A prebronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 110 % predict ( Quanjer , 2012 ) OR FEV1 : Forced vital capacity ( FVC ) ratio &lt; 0.8 . Previously confirm history two exacerbation require treatment systemic corticosteroid ( CS ) ( intramuscular [ IM ] , intravenous , oral ) , 12 month prior visit 1 , despite use highdose inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) . For participant receive maintenance CS , CS treatment exacerbation must twofold increase great dose . No change dose regimen baseline ICS and/or additional controller medication runin period . Male female : Females childbearing potential must commit consistent correct use acceptable method contraception duration trial 4 month last dose investigational product . A urine pregnancy test require girl childbearing potential . This test perform initial screen visit ( visit 1 ) perform schedule study visit prior administration investigational product , early withdrawal followup visit . Parent ( ) /guardian able give write informed consent prior participation study , include ability comply requirement restriction list consent form . If applicable , participant must able willing give assent take part study accord local requirement . For Part B : The subject complete study assessment upto include Visit 8 receive 3 dos investigational product ( IP ) Part A For Part B : The Principal Investigator ( PI ) perform benefit/risk assessment assessment support continue therapy mepolizumab . The subject 's parent ( guardian ) give consent subject give assent continue treatment Participants history life threaten asthma ( e.g . require intubation ) , immunosuppressive medication intake immunodeficiency disorder . Participants medical condition circumstance make volunteer unsuitable participation study . Significant abnormality rate , interval , conduction rhythm 12lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , determine investigator conjunction age gender child Visit 1 . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , bilirubin &gt; 2x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) Visit 1 . Positive Hepatitis B Surface Antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody Visit 1 . Parent/guardian history psychiatric disease , intellectual deficiency , substance abuse , condition ( e.g . inability read , comprehend write ) limit validity consent participate study . Unwillingness inability participant parent/guardian follow procedure outline protocol . Participant mentally legally incapacitate . Children ward state government . A participant eligible study he/she immediate family member participate investigator , subinvestigator , study coordinator , employee participate investigator . Omalizumab : Participants receive omalizumab within 130 day Visit 1 . Other Biologics : Participants receive biological ( omalizumab ) treat inflammatory disease within 5 halflives visit 1 . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Hypersensitivity : Participants allergy/intolerance monoclonal antibody biologic . The participant participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) .</criteria>
