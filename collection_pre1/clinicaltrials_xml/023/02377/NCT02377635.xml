	<brief_summary>This clinical trial prove selenium treat arsenic exposure human promote excretion . The new trial differs previous trial participant maintain local clinic provide food water home village . The purpose study determine fate selenium supplement feces , urine blood volunteer live condition high arsenic load drinking water . The use clinic enable monitoring intake excretion arsenic selenium , ensure participant take selenium dos placebo appropriate . This proof concept absolutely essential groundwork remediation strategy involve selenium supplement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Main Purpose : Determine fate selenium supplement feces , urine blood new Phase I/II clinical trial pharmacodynamics study Bangladesh . This include conventional analysis feces , urine blood sample , trace fate selenium administer isotopically enrich 77Se ( naturally occur non-radioactive stable isotope ) . The use 77Se allow u discriminate endogenous selenium already body trial participant ( patient ) administer selenium give patient . Clinical Trial Hypotheses : - In group patient exhibit symptom arsenicosis ( chronic low-level arsenic poisoning ) , single , elevate dose anhydrous sodium selenite lead excretion arsenic level significantly high patient receive placebo . - In selenite-supplemented ( treatment ) group , total arsenic excrete significantly high consume diet drinking water . - In treatment group , selenium co-excreting arsenic originates administer selenium supplement , rather endogenous selenium . - The ratio arsenic selenium feces , urine blood treatment group follow administration selenium supplement approximately 1:1 , consistent formation discrete molecular entity , seleno bis-S-glutathionyl arsinium anion discover investigator ' early animal experiment . The process follow : A tightly control Phase I/II clinical trial Bangladesh prove selenium remove arsenic victim ' body . 40 volunteer arsenicosis sufferer house local private in-patient clinic 10 consecutive day . While clinic , follow fix , communal diet consist drinking water meal village . On 6th day clinic investigator give single dose either placebo ( table salt , 0.8 mg ) anhydrous sodium selenite ( 0.8 mg selenium ) label non-radioactive naturally occur isotope ( 77Se ) , distinguish selenium already body . Placebo anhydrous sodium selenite look similar taste much alike . Placebo anhydrous sodium selenite supply powdered form bottom glass dilute 100 ml purified water immediately ingest participant close control clinical staff . The investigator analyze arsenic selenium level feces , urine blood sample dose , use molecular speciation analyse determine chemical form blood , urine feces . Also , investigator analyze arsenic selenium level finger- toenail hair begin trial possible biomarker As exposure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The participant study 1. healthy adult ( 1865 year age ) male Bangladeshi volunteer Laksam Upazila , 2. expose arsenic normal source drinking water ; 3. otherwise healthy except show sign chronic arsenic toxicity ( arsenicosis ) ; 4. consume seleniumcontaining supplement last 6 month ; 5. concurrently participate participate clinical trial within least 30 day registration current trial . 1 . Recent history consume selenium , concurrent participation recent participation clinical trial within least 30 day registration current trial , people recently move area . 2 . Prior clinical trial , recruit undertake medical examination physician . Since chronic kidney disease alcoholic viral cirrhosis common rural Bangladesh condition might impact selenium arsenic metabolism , recruit also screen baseline CMP ( Comprehensive Metabolic Panel ) , CBC ( Complete Blood Count ) , INR ( International Normalized Ratio Prothrombin Time Liver Function Test ) panel . Evidence history significant hematologic , renal , endocrine , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , psychiatric , musculoskeletal , immunologic , neurologic dermatologic disease ( include drug allergy clinically significant ) , opinion investigator , could pose risk safety individual valid conduct study exclude recruit participation . 3 . Current evidence history cancer ; evidence hepatitis B , hepatitis C , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection upon serological testing ; evidence active communicable disease febrile illness ( e.g. , bronchopulmonary , urinary gastrointestinal ) within 7 day prior study exclude recruit participation .</criteria>
