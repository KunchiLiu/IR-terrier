	<detailed_description>The four main secondary objective I-CARE project : - To investigate prospectively impact anti-TNF base strategy natural history IBD potential disease modification collect validated surrogate marker mucosal heal disease complication bowel damage ( stricture , fistula , abscess ) , surgery , hospitalization - To assess evolution Patient Reported Outcome ( ePRO ) yearly basis impact anti-TNF agent ePRO IBD - To evaluate benefit-risk ratio strategy base earlier wide use anti-TNF therapy IBD - To assess healthcare cost cost-efficacy current therapeutic strategy IBD 5-ASA Steroids across Europe At least 5000 IBD patient treat 5-ASA Steroids FU 3 year - use 5-ASA efficacy ( persistence , switch , mucosal heal etc . ) - chemoprevention CRC : first study specifically accurately address question - use budesonide mmx efficacy ( clinical efficacy , mucosal heal potential disease modification ) - safety steroid ( infection etc ) STUDY DESIGN : 22 patient per investigator , 800 investigator total 17600 patient . Each Investigator recruit enrol 20 patient impose treatment stratification : Group 1 : 5 without previous ongoing exposure IS biologics , ( 5 ASA Steroids allow ) Group 2 : 5 on-going anti-TNF monotherapy Group 3 : 5 thiopurines monotherapy Group 4 : 5 on-going combination therapy Group 5 : 2 patient vedolizumab ( vedolizumab alone 1 combination therapy )</detailed_description>
