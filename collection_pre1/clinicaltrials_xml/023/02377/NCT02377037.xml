	<detailed_description>Introduction Regular physical activity ( PA ) positively influence physiological process human body . Inversely , sedentary behavior ( SB ) —too much sit distinct little physical activity—contributes adversely cardio metabolic health outcome premature mortality [ 1-3 ] . Obesity result long-term excess energy consume vs. energy expend , positive energy balance [ 4 ] . While overeat certainly contribute positive energy balance , epidemic obesity relate metabolic disorder also drive reduction energy expend [ 5 ] . Modern human environment vastly different ancestor . Technologic development transportation , communication , workplace , home entertainment confer wealth comfort , increase time spent SB represent cost human health [ 6 ] . With increase use computer , office worker may remain seated long period time metabolic cost ( MC ) minimal , make many worksites obesogenic environment [ 7 ] . Sitting time contributes positive energy balance also independent risk factor excess adiposity [ 8,9 ] obesity [ 10 ] even among people participate high level moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) [ 11,12 ] . Even without perform exercise people markedly variable low intensity physical activity ( LIPA ) level , turn substantially varies PA energy expenditure ( PAEE ) 2000 kcal/day [ 13 ] . Emerging evidence support feasibility raise daily MC replace office work-related SB LIPA via workstation alternative traditional office chair desktop computer-based combination [ 14 ] . Regardless total sitting time , evidence grow metabolic benefit interrupt sit time often [ 15-17 ] , less focus MC result break . There basic science difference MC associate `` sit '' `` stand '' , however result contradictory [ 14,18 ] . Also , alternative investigate [ 14,19 ] seem term MC , sit stability ball use sit-stand/standing desk comparable traditional seat condition EE ( ≅1.2 kcal min ( -1 ) ) . The treadmill pedal desk ( active workstation alternative ) show offer great promise term EE ( ≅2-4 kcal min ( -1 ) ) [ 14 ] . Another strategy introduce walk break prolong sedentary time accord recent study [ 20 ] yield additional 24 , 59 132 kcal per day , stand walk normal , self-selected pace one , two five minute compare sit 8-hour working period . From intervention , heart rate ( HR ) also examine assess difference condition significant between-condition difference heart rate . Therefore , take break sit potential outlet prevent obesity rise obesity real contribution simple action stand seat position return seat position ( sit/stand transition ) MC HR yet investigate . To overcome limitation , randomize control trial conduct examine MC HR associate sit , stand , transition previous behavior laboratory setting use accurate method ( indirect calorimetry ) . By include methodological approach able estimate additional contribution `` break '' compare stand accumulate sedentary time MC HR [ 18 ] . Hypothesis 1 . The percent increase MC heart rate ( HR ) rest associate sitting , stand sitting/stand transition different , independently gender , body composition , age . 2 . The MC , either per kg body weight per kg fat-free mass , associate sit stand similar high cost expect sitting-to-stand transition , regardless gender , age , FFM . Purposes 1 . To determine MC difference sit , stand transition condition , adjust effect gender , body composition , age . 2 . To determine HR difference sit , stand transition , adjust effect gender , body composition , age . Participants Sample power analysis For sample power calculation use ( GPower software , version 3.1.9.2 ) consider MC continuous response variable . Based pilot study small sample size aim test difference MC three condition assess indirect calorimetry effect size approximately 0.385 use repeat measure ANCOVA . Therefore need study 50 participant able reject null hypothesis population mean three experimental condition equal probability ( power ) 0.8 . The Type I error probability associate test null hypothesis 0.05 . Considering 10 % drop rate may occur due invalid data enroll 60 participant use crossover design participant randomly assign perform 3 condition different order . Sample recruitment selection A total 60 healthy participant , men woman select . Participants recruit advertisement place nearby institution volunteer participate study . If inclusion criterion present participant randomly assign one condition ' order participate study . Assessments Anthropometry Subjects weigh near 0.1kg wear minimal clothes without shoe height measure near 0.1cm digital scale integrate stadiometer ( Seca , Hamburg , Germany ) accord standardized procedure describe elsewhere [ 21 ] . BMI calculate use formula [ weight ( Kg ) /height2 ( m2 ) ] . Body Composition To estimate total fat mass FFM use dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( Hologic Explorer-W , Waltham , USA ) . A whole-body scan perform attenuation X-rays pulse 70 140 kV synchronously line frequency pixel scan image measure . Resting Energy Expenditure ( REE ) The REE estimate use open-circuit spirometry system ( MedGraphics Corporation , Breezeex Software ) . Subjects lye supine ~45 minute . The calorimeter device attach mask breath-by-breath VO2 VCO2 measure 30 minute period . Data analyze accord procedure describe elsewhere [ 22 ] . MC measurement test condition The MC estimate use open-circuit spirometry system ( MedGraphics Corporation , Breezeex Software ) . Each participant complete 4 period ( condition ) 10 minute calorimeter device attach mask breath-by-breath VO2 VCO2 measure 40 minute . The first condition remain seated chair , hand place top thigh 10 minute , remain motionless . The second condition identical first participant upright position ( stand ) . Finally , third condition , participant perform one sitting-to-stand follow stand-to-sitting transition , every minute . The order three condition randomly assign . Heart rate measure continuously use pulse oximeter attach MedGraphics system . This medical device indirectly monitor oxygen saturation patient 's blood ( opposed measuring oxygen saturation directly blood sample ) . Heart rate oxygen consumption data analyze minute-by-minute . Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis perform use SPSS Statistics version 22.0 , 2013 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) . Descriptive statistic ( mean ± SD ) calculate outcome measurement . Normality verify use Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . A repeated measure ANCOVA post hoc analysis use compare difference condition , adjust potential covariates ( FFM age ) consider order condition ' randomization between-subject effect . To test sphericity homogeneity variance , Mauchly 's statistical test perform . Statistical significance set ( p &lt; 0.05 ) Risk/benefit analysis The study first aim assess MC associate sit , stand , sitting-to-stand transition . By able estimate additional contribution actual transition MC compare sit stand long period time . Evidence find SB deleterious effect general health status , specifically associate positive energy balance lead adiposity weight gain thus increase risk obesity relate metabolic risk factor . Therefore , participant benefit intervention [ 23 ] . No risk add participate study risk associate intervention . Recognized safe technique use assess MC body composition . Privacy confidentiality data This research take place approve ethic Committee Faculdade de Motricidade Humana Universidade de Lisboa conduct accordance declaration Helsinki human study . All participant inform possible risk investigation give write informed consent participate . The collect data treat analyzed confidentiality privacy always keep . Therefore , data collect treat without personal identifier never provide code . The data keep excel SPSS file faculty server connect Exercise Health Laboratory . Later document receive data participant destroy database construct . Participants ' compensation insurance There expense cost associated participation study therefore participant need insurance . However , describe informed consent , transportation laboratory support participant . Who contact case emergence ? Pedro Júdice . Conflicts interest The author declare conflict interest within study .</detailed_description>
