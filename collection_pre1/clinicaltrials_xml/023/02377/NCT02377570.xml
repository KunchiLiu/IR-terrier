	<brief_summary>The study investigate performance new dialyzer ( Theranova 400 ) contain membrane increase pore sizes . The performance determine removal middle molecule ( different molecular size ) blood compartment . Three different Theranova 400 prototype ( AA , BB CC ) operate hemodialysis mode compare Cordiax FX-80 dialyzer , operate hemodialysis mode . Safety event albumin loss dialysate monitor</brief_summary>
