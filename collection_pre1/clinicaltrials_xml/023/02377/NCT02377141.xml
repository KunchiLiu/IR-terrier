	<brief_title>Early Use TIPSS Patients With Cirrhosis Variceal Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale Study Gastro-oesophageal varix present 50 % patient cirrhosis [ 2 ] serious complication portal hypertension rupture result potentially life threaten variceal haemorrhage overall mortality rate historically report 30-50 % [ 3 ] . Although mortality 40 % 6 week , 70 % one year [ 2 ] . With generally improve management critically ill cirrhotic patient , together vasoactive therapy new endoscopic technique manage variceal haemorrhage , overall mortality reduce , one centre Europe show reduction 42 % 1980 14 % 2000 [ 4 ] . 60-80 % patient bleed varix re-bleed treated [ 5-8 ] , risk re-bleeding great first 10 day [ 1,9 ] , 50 % go re-bleed , . The risk re-bleeding gradually fall first month additional 10 % re-bleed [ 7 , 8 ] ; risk first six week plateaus . Despite advent endoscopic therapy early pharmacological therapy , re-bleeding rate still high early , factor predictive early re-bleeding /treatment failure 5 day include : active bleeding index endoscopy ; severity liver disease ( Child-Pugh class ) ; severity bleed ; severity portal hypertension [ 1 , 10 ] . Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient ( HVPG ) one best predictor identify re-bleed . After index variceal bleed , reduction HVPG le 12mmHg least 20 % , reduces risk re-bleeding 46-65 % 0.13 % [ 11 ] . HVPG measurement usually limited specialist centre . The early use TIPSS explore two study [ 1,12 ] . The first [ 12 ] categorise patient present variceal bleed either high low risk re-bleeding determine HVPG . Those HVPG great equal 20mmHg go receive early TIPSS improve outcome compare treat medically . However , result must interpret caution , medical management current standard care . A study investigate use early TIPSS variceal haemorrhage carry Garcia-Pagan colleague [ 1 ] . This landmark study select patient early TIPSS ( within 3 day ) determine Child-Pugh score . Participants , Child 's B C cirrhosis on-going bleeding , progress early use TIPSS ( e-PFTE-covered stent ) . The result trial demonstrate significant reduction failure control bleed re-bleeding increase risk hepatic encephalopathy . The study also demonstrate significant survival benefit early TIPSS time point . There , however , several feature study raise concern . Firstly recruitment prolong ( 3 year ) recruit 63 patient via 9 centre , high exclusion rate ( 296 patient exclude ) . The second concern feature inclusion patient ongoing bleed follow index endoscopy . This might arguably term rescue TIPSS although study do area intuitive suggest survival would improve haemostasis achieve . Thirdly , survival 1 year early TIPSS extremely high ( 86 % vs. 61 % medical management group ) . For patient Child 's C cirrhosis present variceal bleed survival rate remarkable . These two study [ 1 , 12 ] early use TIPSS variceal haemorrhage first portal hypertension show mortality benefit . As demand action . Either management variceal bleed patient advanced cirrhosis must change , give concern regard study design significant cost implication , result need validate . STUDY DESIGN This multi-centre , open-label , parallel-group , randomise control trial . Both hospital take part trial 24-hour TIPSS service . Potential participant patient diagnosis liver cirrhosis present variceal haemorrhage participate hospital fulfil exclusion criterion . Potential participant identify gastroenterology team responsible patient care . Patients relatives approach nominated registrar , consultant , identify ethic application delegation log . Patients follow one year review three occasion . Patients consent enter trial randomize either : ( 1 ) EVBL ( `` standard care '' ) arm ( 2 ) early TIPSS arm . FOLLOW UP During regular Hepatology follow-up , patient review 6 week , 6 month , 12 month , end study . TIPSS patency check 6 month 1 year per current standard protocol . All patient follow death end study , whichever first . IDENTIFYING PARTICIPANTS Potential participant patient diagnosis liver cirrhosis present acute variceal haemorrhage participate hospital fulfil exclusion criterion . All aetiology cirrhosis ( include cryptogenic aetiology yet establish ) include . Potential participant identify gastroenterology team responsible patient . The consultant responsible care patient determine whether identified patient suitable may approach . OBTAINING CONSENT If patient alert able give inform consent issue patient information sheet consent seek patient . Patients next kin sufficient time usually 3 hour , index endoscopy consent inclusion study . Patients liver disease may fluctuate conscious level may lack capacity due hepatic encephalopathy . Potential participant lack capacity include study . Here capacity assess consent clinician time take consent . A consent seek patient regain capacity . RANDOMISATION This study involve simple 1:1 randomisation . Randomisation do use web-based randomisation programme available 24 hour day study centre . STUDY ASSESSMENT Participants attend gastroenterology/hepatology clinic respective hospital three occasion one-year period . If participant hospital time schedule visit either assess whilst inpatient program visit outpatient . The programme visit : 6 Weeks , 6 Months 1 year . SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION Given validate result Garcia Pagan study , power study use result observe . We wish find difference survival two trial arm . Garcia Pagan observe 14 % 39 % death two trial arm . We calculate would need 48 patient per group . This 2-sided log-rank test , alpha=0.05 , power 80 % , allow 4 extra patient per group allow drop non-compliance .</detailed_description>
