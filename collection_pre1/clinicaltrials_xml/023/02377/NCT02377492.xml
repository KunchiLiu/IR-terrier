	<brief_title>Paracervical Vasopressin Injection Compared With Intramyometrial Vasopressin Abdominal Myomectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After initial physician consultation investigation complete , treatment option review patient . If patient chooses proceed abdominal myomectomy , offer participation study . If chooses participate , patient undergo routine pre-operative assessment include either transvaginal ultrasound pelvic MRI . The pre-operative hemoglobin level measure within least 2 week operative procedure . Randomization either vasopressin group placebo group carry operating room assign recruited patient consecutively number , seal opaque envelope , contain designate treatment determine computer-generated series random number . The randomization perform independent member division involve study . At time induction anesthesia , seal envelope open research fellow . At time induction anesthesia , seal envelope open reveal randomization research fellow . The attend physician remain blind . The research fellow prepare either placebo solution vasopressin responsible perform paracervical injection . The attend physician responsible record surgeon rate bleeding , total ebl , total operating time . In group , one vial ( 20 unit ) vasopressin dilute 40mL normal saline solution . Not 16mL ( 8units ) vasopressin use . This dose chosen standard vasopressin dose routinely use . The dose well maximum amount vasopressin use , level complication see past . Given standard practice patient receive intramyometrial vasopressin injection , group medication order prepared . In patient randomized paracervical vasopressin , 8mL ( 4mL per side cervix ) inject use 22F spinal needle . An additional 8mL ( 4 unit ) inject intramyometrial standard care practice . In patient randomized paracervical vasopressin , 16mL ( 8 unit ) use inject vasopressin intramyometrial prior myomectomy . This help determine routine delivery vasopressin aid decrease blood loss . The operative case otherwise proceed standard fashion . The total ebl , total operative time , myomectomy operative time record . The myomectomy operative time record time first incision uterus , complete closure uterine defect .</detailed_description>
