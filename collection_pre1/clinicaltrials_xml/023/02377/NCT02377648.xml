	<brief_summary>The CART Pilot study design provide preliminary observation ( performance safety ) generate hypotheses future study . The primary goal study evaluate performance one year second-generation ABSORB Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold ( BVS ) ( Abbott Vascular , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) , Everolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold , heart transplant recipient affect cardiac allograft vasculopathy ( CAV ) significative coronary stenosis . The secondary objective : - collect data procedural clinical outcome post-procedure , 30 day , 180 day 1,2 3-year follow-up , patient underwent ABSORB BVS implantation order investigate safety device CAV population ; - evaluate progression disease interaction study device use data derive multi-imaging invasive technique . The vascular reparative therapy particular BVS technology show important advantage term endothelial preservation , adequate vasomotion , restoration medium adventitia vessel wall , could represent new effective therapeutic option , compare bare-metal drug-eluting stent technology , transplant patient , since mechanism may , least part , counteract detrimental change lead CAV , namely constrictive remodel rapid atherosclerosis progression . Subjects enrol clinical study male female derive heart transplant recipient population every participating center . The clinical study enroll 30 subject . Subjects , underwent yearly expect coronary angiography follow-up heart transplant surgery , meet general angiographic inclusion exclusion criterion ( eligibility assess Heart Team consensus ) ask sign inform consent form . Subjects meet inclusion exclusion criterion subject standard follow-up heart transplant ( HTx ) recipients undergo invasive evaluation 365 ± 28 day . The study comprise two distinct phase : - enrollment phase start recruitment first subject plan last one year ; - follow-up phase plan last three year enrollment last patient . The total duration study four year , include enrollment follow-up phase</brief_summary>

	<criteria>General Inclusion criterion : All enrol patient must heart transplant recipient . The inclusion criterion must follow recent instruction use ( IFU ) BVS may include Limited following : Patient must least 18 year age time sign Informed Consent Form Patient must eligible percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) Patient treat de novo lesion locate previously untreated vessel . Patient must agree undergo require followup visit data collection . Angiographic inclusion criterion : • Presence least one critical angiographic de novo lesion ( DS ≥70 % ) noncritical angiographic de novo lesion ( 50 % ≤ DS &lt; 70 % ) associate concomitant sign symptom myocardial ischemia . Any intermediate lesion without clear evidence ischemia interrogate mean fractional flow reserve assessment pressure wire , recommend current international guideline General Exclusion criterion : Inability obtain sign informed consent potential patient . Contraindications drug elute scaffold implantation ( know hypersensitivity contraindication aspirin , heparin bivalirudin , clopidogrel , ticlopidine , prasugrel , ticagrelor , everolimus , poly ( Llactide ) , poly ( D , Llactide ) , platinum , contrast sensitivity , adequately premedicated ) . Female patient childbearing potential positive pregnancy test within 7 day prior index procedure . Prior Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) time plan CABG .</criteria>
