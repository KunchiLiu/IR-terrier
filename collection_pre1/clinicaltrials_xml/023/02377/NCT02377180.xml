	<brief_summary>There currently specific diagnostic test primary muscular pain . The present study investigate whether selective blockade suprascapular nerve effectively abolish experimental pain arise supraspinatus muscle . Experimental muscle pain induce intramuscular injection capsaicin , alkaloid red chili pepper . The study consist three part : 1. describe development , time course intensity capsaicin-induced muscle pain 2. evaluate effectiveness suprascapular nerve block capsaicin-induced muscle pain 3. compare suprascapular nerve block direct intramuscular local anesthetic infiltration effectiveness capsaicin-induced muscle pain</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Musculoskeletal pain one common reason consult physician . Many musculoskeletal pain disorder associate widespread decrease pain threshold , indicate state hyperexcitability central nervous system . This central hypersensitivity assess measure pain threshold different experimental stimulus , use so-called quantitative sensory test ( QST ) . Several experimental pain model use healthy volunteer order study central mechanism pain processing . Injection capsaicin one , associate spread local pain , development refer pain hyperalgesia thermal , mechanical electrical stimulus . Intramuscular injection capsaicin therefore potentially interesting investigate primary muscle pain , central hypersensitivity endogenous pain modulation . The present research project comprise three substudies use intramuscular capsaicin detect change central pain processing evaluate clinical tool diagnosis primary muscle pain . Part 1 : The investigator hypothesize intensity , duration expansion area capsaicin-induced muscle pain depend subject 's endogenous pain modulation . The investigator expect subject strong endogenous pain modulation develop less pain hyperalgesia capsaicin injection subject poor endogenous pain modulation . A large sample healthy volunteer therefore screen use QST recruit capsaicin injection show either strong weak endogenous pain modulation . The data whole sample use determine normative value endogenous pain modulation . Part 2 investigates ability suprascapular nerve block abolish primary muscle pain . Healthy volunteer receive capsaicin injection supraspinatus muscle trapezius muscle control condition randomize , blind fashion . The investigator expect nerve block effective former compare latter muscle . Part 3 compare analgesic efficacy suprascapular nerve block direct intramuscular local anesthetic infiltration supraspinatus muscle capsaicin injection . This determine procedure effective treat primary muscle pain . Objective 1 . To determine normative value endogenous pain modulation healthy volunteer 2 . To demonstrate capsaicin-induced pain hyperalgesia depend endogenous pain modulation 3 . To calculate sensitivity specificity suprascapular nerve block diagnosis primary muscle pain 4 . To determine whether suprascapular nerve block intramuscular local anesthetic infiltration effective muscle pain Methods 1. intramuscular injection capsaicin 2. quantitative sensory test ( pressure pain threshold ) 3. ultrasound-guided suprascapular nerve block 4. ultrasound-guided intramuscular local anesthetic infiltration</detailed_description>
