	<brief_summary>Our long term objective enhance pediatrician 's management child feed difficulty primary care office-based pediatric practice set . A prerequisite rapidly reach accurate diagnosis appropriate therapy apply . To improve efficiency accuracy diagnostic interview investigator design Feeding Difficulty Diagnostic Tool ( FDDT ) consist set question fit beneath 'diagnostic cover ' prompt basic information . Depending answer render questionnaire particular diagnosis note cover flag consideration . In study specific objectives 1 ) ass feasibility acceptability use FDDT pediatrician 's office 2 ) obtain preliminary data reliability use instrument diagnosis management child feed difficulty . - Feasibility acceptability often interrelate assessed broad sense questionnaire ascertain , example , amount time need parent staff fill use FDDT questionnaire , ease difficulty encounter fill FDDT questionnaire understand questionnaire parent . - Reliability relate usefulness FDDT questionnaire pediatrician obtain organize information obtain history physical include anthropometric data reach correct diagnosis , latter judge study diagnosis reach independently train expert pediatric feed difficulty use modification standard diagnostic interview . The frequency presentation various diagnostic sub-categories extent discrepancy conclusion suggest FDDT , pediatrician , feed disorder expert unknown . Therefore ' pilot study need help determine sample size necessary power definitive study diagnostic tool 's accuracy , necessary . The investigator anticipate least three category ( child excessive selectivity , child demonstrably poor appetite vigorous free organic disease , misperceive feeding limitation ) well represent preliminary study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Feeding Difficulties Diagnostic Tool Questionnaire For Children With Oral Feeding Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Surveys conduct throughout world repeatedly demonstrate approximately 50 % mother consider least one child feed difficulty , mean resist take appropriate amount food . This implicate 20 % 30 % child . The milder case frequently consider `` picky eater '' although well nourish significant risk coercive feeding . This turn associate cognitive limitation behavioral problem . Sub-groups exhibit poor growth , sub-optimal nutrient consumption relative body size , others underlie co-morbid organic disease . To help identify relevant intervention child , whether reassurance parent , counsel resolve behavioral problem ( child feeder ) , nutritional intervention and/or medical treatment , necessary identify separate condition contribute feed difficulty complication appropriate treatment tailor cause . The task categorize child feed problem frequently daunt pediatrician due time constraint lack train field . In developed country , physician may refer child severe feed difficulty specialist ; however , many part world , resource limit absent . Additionally , health care professional narrow perspective base specialized training , whether general medical care , specialize care , nutrition , oral motor therapy . To overcome limitation detail , questionnaire develop base work principal investigator , Dr. Kerzner co-investigator , Dr. Chatoor . This questionnaire fill parent response prompt physician consider relevant diagnostic possibility particular child 's feeding difficulty . Once diagnosis set diagnosis establish utilization questionnaire , specific appropriate therapy provide . The diagnostic category capture tool base typical symptom demonstrate child feed difficulty basis publish principal investigator ( copy attach ) .1 Children one year age divide three group base dominant symptom : poor appetite ; excessive selectivity ; fear feeding . Children poor appetite categorize four sub group : underlie organic medical problem ; active playful whose poor feed lead conflict mother ; fail to-thrive base poor economic circumstance neglect ; , finally , eat appropriate amount food misperceive caregiver poor appetite . Each feed difficulty category different unique approach necessary resolution possible child fit one diagnostic category As diagnostic nomenclature literature confuse state flux data relative prevalence various diagnosis , much less diagnostic category use current classification . Consequently , minimal guidance decision relate sample size ; thus , need pilot study . We believe study allow u insight frequency variance diagnosis least three major category : child vigorous poor appetite , highly selective , fact misperceive feeding problem . We also information feasibility acceptance FDDT questionnaire believe pilot study facilitate gain pediatrician 's office staff 's perspective future design instrument overcome practical limitation become evident . Design : This prospective , observational pilot study conduct single private pediatric office . The pediatrician incorporate FDDT questionnaire part routine evaluation child come `` well baby visit '' . To complete study recruit least 40 child perceive parent guardian feed difficulty . To sure number obtain aim recruit 50 subject . This study approximately one year duration . Data Collection : The follow data collect study subject illustrate flow sheet page 6 research protocol cover sheet . - Historical data report parent guardian FDDT questionnaire - The diagnosis suggest Cover sheet FDDT - The pediatrician 's detail patient 's physical examination , anthropometrics calculation ( weight length height percentile mid parental height ) . A prompt data available FDDT . The patient 's name black study subject number insert . - Data acceptance FDDT obtain office staff , pediatrician , patient ' parent . - The diagnosis reach first feed specialist ( CPNP ) - The diagnosis reach second feeding specialist ( Psychiatrist )</detailed_description>
