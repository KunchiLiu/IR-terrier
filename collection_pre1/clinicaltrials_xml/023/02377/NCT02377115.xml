	<detailed_description>Background : Postoperative delirium ( PD ) - temporary state confusion - frequent complication surgery , commonly occur elderly patient . Depending risk profile , 9-87 % patient affect . Regarding increase age surgical patient , prevention PD even great importance . New data lead assumption medical preventive strategy may influence frequency least severity duration PD . Preventive measure patient increase risk develop PD could possibly administer ; however , clinical predictor PD rare and/or unspecific . Different score test battery assess preoperative risk PD develop , tool time-consuming require trained personnel . In 2014 , computer program develop Department Anesthesia University Hospital Basel . This program call Delirium Risk Profile ( DRP ) may assess risk develop PD . It develop patient age 65 year . The first part record patient detail , age , level training , language , sensory impairment , regular drug intake . The second part test different cognitive function , precisely cognitive self-assessment , temporal orientation , episodic memory , work memory , attention , executive function . In contrary already available tool , application operate patient alone without help train staff . It test healthy individual patient mild cognitive impairment evaluate clinical set determine whether meet validity requirement . Study design : Prospective observational cohort study derivation cohort include patient schedule elective non-cardiac surgery . Number participant : Patients enrol collective 50 patient PD reach . Each study participant collective delirious patient represent 2 % final analysis . With expect incidence PD 25 % , overall sample size 200 patient recruit . Recruitment : Eligible study participant ( patient schedule surgery University Hospital Basel ) identify appointment calendar Anesthesia Preoperative Evaluation Clinic . Methods : This study design calculate accuracy computer program run tablet computer application ( DRP ) . Before surgery , Anesthesia Preoperative Evaluation Clinic , patient performs tablet computer program obtain DRP score , basis research program . A high score attain computer program suggest low risk develop PD . The score compare result postoperative test conduct daily day 1 surgery . The test use second stage Delirium-Rating-Scale-Revised-98 ( DRS-R-98 ) , use diagnose delirium ass severity , Delirium Observation Screening ( DOS ) Scale , Confusion Assessment Method ( CAM ) . These test repeat 5 day , patient discharge - patient develop delirium - symptom delirium subside . Endpoints : Primary endpoint : Correlation test score attain patient self-administered computerized test incidence PD . To determine whether DRP score use reliable predictor PD , patient score use application surgery . This score compare result delirium screen test - DRS-R-98 , DOS Scale , CAM , conduct postoperatively conducted test . The threshold answer main issue DRS-R-98 15 point severity section - ≤15 point speak , &gt; 15 point speak delirium - overall score &gt; 18 point speak delirium . The primary endpoint reach test conduct . Secondary endpoint : Severity PD compare score attained patient self-administered computerized test . The severity delirium respective patient determine use DRS-R-98 . A severity score &gt; 15 point ( use severity part ) overall score &gt; 18 point indicative delirium . Above threshold , severity delirium measure . The high patient score , severe delirium . To assess severity delirium specific patient study , high score test result patient attains , look . This score compare patient 's DRP-derived score use application .</detailed_description>
