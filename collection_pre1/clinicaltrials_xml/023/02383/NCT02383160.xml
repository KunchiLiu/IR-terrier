	<detailed_description>This prospective , double-blind , randomize control trial determine effectiveness low-intensity pulse ultrasound decrease time union scaphoid non-unions operative fixation measure serial CT scanning . Multiple center within Calgary zone involve study order recruit enough patient power study . Blinding include patient , surgeon , research assistant , well data handler analyst trial completion mid-term analysis . Baseline demographic include age , hand dominance , work status medical co-morbidities patient collect allow comparison group ensure similarity . Patients identify clinic appointment initial consultation surgical fixation scaphoid non-union . Patients consent surgical fixation assess inclusion exclusion criterion , appropriate , consent evaluate baseline range motion , grip strength , SF-36 , DASH rest activity VAS score . Pre-operative radiograph assess degree wrist arthritis present . No restriction place selection schedule surgical procedure , use adjuvant bone morphogenic protein limit . Bioventus provide visually identical active sham Exogen 4000 unit . The unit undergo randomization give consecutively numbered label . Devices securely store clinical study center . All clinical center personnel involve blinded randomization . Two week post-operatively subject attend cast clinic assign next sequential device . The device apply window cut standardize cast center point anatomic snuffbox . This cast remain place fracture united CT , 7 week minimum . Treatment self-administered 20 minute daily patient . The device equip system document compliance treatment . Treatment continue subject great 50 % cortical bridging CT scan multi-planar reconstruction . Union confirm orthopedic surgeon independent musculoskeletal radiologist . Treatment also terminate subject continue non-union present 6 month post-operatively . Subjects assess union use serial CT scan union document . CT scan take place 7-9 week , 12-14 week every 4-6 week thereafter per current clinical standard practice . Standard scaphoid wrist radiograph complete within 1 week CT scan . Patients document union classify persistent non-unions ask continue attend clinical follow ups 1 year . Patients required attend baseline follow 8 , 12 , 16 , 36 52 week functional assessment . Patients require additional surgery bone grafting deem necessary treating surgeon schedule surgeon 's discretion surgery record trial adverse event .</detailed_description>
