	<brief_title>Effect Dapagliflozin Microvascular Macrovascular Circulation Total Body Sodium Content</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus , consider begin metabolic disorder , mutate predominantly vascular disease , duration extend several year or/and additional cardiovascular risk factor coexist , particular arterial hypertension . In accordance , patient type 2 diabetes die microvascular macrovascular complication , rarely hypoglycaemic hyperglycaemic shock syndrome [ 1 ] . As consequence , treatment type 2 diabetes focus metabolic control also improve global vascular risk . Analyses compare importance various cardiovascular risk factor conclude reduction blood pressure lipid level significantly important reduction hyperglycemia [ 2 ] . Of course , multidisciplinary approach desirable STENO-2 study clearly indicate mid-term microvascular complication long-term macrovascular complication prevent type 2 diabetes [ 3 ] . Vascular change occur course type 2 diabetes , arterial hypertension elevate global cardiovascular risk reliably assess non-invasively , already early stage vascular remodeling process . For example , guideline European Society Hypertension recommend several vascular # 0284 CSP 130911 v1.4.docx 8 parameter assess already diagnosis disease order analyze early organ damage artery [ 4 ] . The measurement pulse wave velocity , pulse wave analysis , central ( aortic ) systolic pressure pulse pressure tool detect early vascular change large artery relate faster wave reflection arterial tree [ 5 ] . Wall lumen ratio retinal artery , retinal capillary flow flow mediate vasodilation tool detect change microvascular circulation [ 6 ] . These parameter infrequently measure study type 2 diabetes , mainly due lack awareness vascular change key prognostic factor type-2 diabetes ultimately determine fate patient . Dapagliflozin novel selective SLGT-2 inhibitor show improve glycaemic control 2 , 12 , 24 week well 1 2 year . Dapagliflozin produce dose dependent increase glucosuria clinically meaningful change glycemic parameter type 2 diabetes addition weight loss . Most striking , dapagliflozin also find low systolic blood pressure 5 mmHg . This reduction blood pressure might relate weight loss or/and concomitant loss total body sodium content . However , precise mechanism blood pressure reduction need elucidate . Loss sodium would lead less reactive contraction small artery response increase sympathetic activity , angiotensin II [ 7 ] catecholamine . In summary , dapagliflozin exert beneficial effect variety cardiovascular risk factor , hyperglycaemia , hypertension obesity . These change lead ( hypothesis ) improve vascular function micro- macrocirculation . Moreover , increase total body content sodium measure human specific MRI technique [ 8 ] may also reduce dapagliflozin may lead less vasoreactive response since tubular SGLT-2 mediate glucose uptake sodium relate , i.e . blockade lead sodium loss . However , latter nothing hypothesis require clear proof clinical study patient type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
