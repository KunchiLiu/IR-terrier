	<detailed_description>Enteral nutrition preterm intrauterine growth-restricted ( IUGR ) infants remain major challenge neonatologists . Early introduction minimal enteral feeding ( MEF ) enhance gut hormone release , reduce intestinal permeability improve motility intestinal tract , thus promote gut functional maturation . Due gastrointestinal immaturity , however , preterm infant likely develop clinical symptom feed intolerance ( FI ) , abdominal distention , vomit , abundant and/or bilious gastric residual , occult gross bloody stool . FI could represent early sign necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) , fear gastrointestinal complication prematurity . The occurrence FI often prompt neonatologists withhold , decrease discontinue enteral feed , thus hamper establishment adequate early enteral nutrition . Early identification preterm infant high risk gastrointestinal complication could help clinical decision introduction advancement enteral feeding . The administration first fee healthy preterm infant lead post-prandial increase superior mesenteric artery ( SMA ) blood flow , detect Doppler ultrasound . A significant correlation early feeding tolerance increase SMA blood flow velocity observe one hour first fee . Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) provide non-invasive monitor regional oxygen saturation ( rSO2 ) previously use evaluate mesenteric perfusion preterm infant increase risk intestinal complication . Abdominal rSO2 detect NIRS show effectively reflect mesenteric blood flow change . A significant correlation lower abdominal rSO2 value first week life subsequent NEC development recently observe cohort preterm infant , confirm previous data animal model . Current evidence role NIRS monitoring predict FI development still limit . To date , indeed , splanchnic oxygenation pattern response first bolus fee possible correlation subsequent FI development establish yet . The aim study assess abdominal rSO2 pattern response first bolus fee evaluate possible correlation development gastrointestinal complication . Infants admit Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) consecutively enrol study fulfil follow criterion : gestational age ≤34 week , stable clinical condition , availability antenatal Doppler data . Exclusion criterion : - Enteral feeding prior enrollment - Major congenital abnormality - Central nervous system diseases - Hypoxic injury - Hemodynamic instability , hypotension , patent ductus arteriole , anemia , sepsis infection time first feed . - Antenatal Doppler impairment . Written , inform consent participate study obtain parents/legal guardian infant enrollment . During first feed administration , enrol infant undergo continuous monitor cerebral splanchnic rSO2 mean INVOS 5100 oximeter . NIRS record perform 30 minute 3 hour feed administration . Cerebral splanchnic rSO2 record every 5 second . Baseline value define mean 15 minute meal ; value record feed administration cluster 5-minute interval . Feeding intolerance define enteral feed withhold least 1 day due onset gastrointestinal symptom . Patients ' characteristic ( include gestational age , birth weight , tolerance enteral feed hospitalization ) record specific case report form time enteral feed introduction discharge . In relation clinical characteristic , enrol infant retrospectively allocate 2 group : - Group 1 : infant develop FI hospitalization ; - Group 2 : infant develop FI hospitalization ; Data analyze use IBM SPSS Statistic version 20.0.0 ( IBM Corporation , IBM Corporation Armonk , New York , United States ) . Clinical characteristic study group compare t-test continuous variable chi-square test categorical variable . Mann-Whitney U test use compare abdominal rSO2 pattern response first fee group 1 2 . A multivariate analysis also perform assess effect possible confounding factor .</detailed_description>
