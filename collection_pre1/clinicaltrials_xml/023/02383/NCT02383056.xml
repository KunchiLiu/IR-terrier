	<brief_summary>The goal study evaluate effectiveness light-emitting diode ( LED ) promote heal wound low leg result surgery . Wounds low leg heal slowly wound head neck ; also remain deep red six month one year . Doctors usually allow low leg surgical wound heal , without stitch additional treatment . This leg wound hold stitch well stitch could cause problem . A major drawback allow surgical wound lower leg heal long healing time often take month . The investigator wish evaluate LED light treatment surgical wound improve heal wound . In order test leg wound heal faster treatment LED , half patient study receive LED ( Group 2 ) half receive treatment LED receive `` sham light '' treatment ( Group 1 ) . Essentially , sham light treatment refers regular light ( LED ) exposure 20 minute . The sham light come device treatment light ( Omnilux machine ) however , light anticipated effect wound heal use simply reduce amount bias sometimes complicate result study . There added risk benefit patient control group expose sham light . Both group receive standard care wound low extremity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Group 2 study receive LED half receive treatment LED receive `` sham light '' treatment ( Group 1 ) . Essentially , sham light treatment refers regular light ( LED ) exposure 20 minute . The sham light come device treatment light ( Omnilux machine ) however , light anticipated effect wound heal use simply reduce amount bias sometimes complicate result study . There added risk benefit patient control group expose sham light . Both group receive standard care wound low extremity . Groups 1 2 receive 4 sham light treatment session , respectively ( one session every week 4 week ) . After session do , subject continue weekly follow visit wound close , 3 month surgery pass ; ever happen first . One final follow visit occur 1 week wound close .</detailed_description>
