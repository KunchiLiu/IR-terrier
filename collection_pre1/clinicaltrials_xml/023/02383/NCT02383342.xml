	<brief_title>Pain Processing Chronic Pain Humans : Exploring Genetic Factors Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain frequent cause suffer disability society . Chronic pain seriously impair quality life million people worldwide . 10-50 % surgical patient report chronic pain surgery ; 10 % report severe pain . Thus , chronic pain significant medical financial burden society . Despite considerable involvement genetic factor pain sensation sensitivity , individual gene involve remain largely unidentified . Knowledge genetic factor , phenotypic expression pain processing , link neuronal correlate improve understand pain aetiology process involve pain perception chronification . Also , serve biomarkers predict chronic pain development progression patient help early individual treatment adaptation . In study establish prospective database biobank patient undergo elective major surgery . Using data database biobank , identify genetic factor contribute development chronic pain surgery . In addition , marker pain modulation chronification gene expression protein level , phenotypic measure pain process include neuroimaging feature study . Over period 10 year prospectively include 10,000 patient visit hospital elective major surgery . Data define participant demographic , medical history questionnaire data collect stored dedicated database . Additional detail ( surgery perioperative management , pain processing phenotype surgical pain outcome ) store . Besides Electroencephalography and/or magnetoencephalography , Magnetic Resonance Imaging perform subgroup ( n=70 ) .</detailed_description>
