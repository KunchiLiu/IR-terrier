Premedication midazolam decide anesthesiologist . If need , patient receive standard oral midazolam plus acetaminophen ( V ) . If patient require premedication midazolam , oral acetaminophen give alone ( NV ) . Patients randomize receive either acupuncture standard general anesthesia care ( A ) receive standard anesthetic care alone ( S ) . Patients , family member recovery registered nurse ( RNs ) know acupuncture perform . Intraoperative anesthetic technique standardize include inhaled induction nitrous oxide sevoflurane . Anesthesia maintenance inhale sevoflurane usual pain medication ketorolac give intramuscularly prior emergence . Acupuncture needle place anesthesia induction remove prior leave operating room . A total 4 needle place , one wrist Heart 7 ( HT7 ) point one ear Shen Men point . The needle insert bilaterally depth 1.8 mm . In PACU , blind study observer evaluate patient four time point use PAED scale : time awaken 5 , 10 &amp; 15 minute awaken . Follow phone call make one day one week surgery .

	<brief_title>Acupuncture Prevention Emergence Delirium Children Undergoing Myringotomy Tube Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myringotomy tube placement one commonly perform operation child , almost 700,000 complete United States year 1 . Common anesthetic management case include inhalational anesthesia intravenous line placement . Sevoflurane inhalational agent use commonly induction maintenance patient . Emergence delirium sevoflurane maintenance common . In study child receive sevoflurane-based anesthetic MRIs , 47.6 % participant emergence agitation 2 . In comparison different emergence delirium scale , Bajwa colleague detect emergence delirium 32 % subject use Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium ( PAED ) scale 3 . Emergence delirium distress child caregiver . During emergence delirium child become danger others around , include family member hospital staff . Emergence delirium also delay discharge post-operative care unit ( PACU ) . There publish evidence intraoperative acupuncture decrease incidence post-operative delirium . One study enrol 60 child undergoing bilateral ear tube placement randomize half patient receive acupuncture point LI-4 ( gu ) HT-7 ( shen men ) . The acupuncture group low incidence emergence agitation control group time arrival PACU follow 30 minute 4 . This study include patient receive pre-medication midazolam . It also use validated assessment emergence delirium child . A small retrospective review 12 child receive acupuncture find 83 % show sign emergence delirium . These patient needle 3 location ( SP 6 , HT 7 , Liv 3 ) magnet place ear shen men area . The anesthetic technique use patient standardized comparison group . The primary objective study determine acupuncture , use combination standard anesthetic management , decrease incidence emergence delirium pediatric patient follow myringotomy tube placement . Patients without premedication midazolam include common child receive sedate medication facilitate separation caregiver . A secondary objective study determine institution 's actual incidence emergence delirium operation . We also compare rate emergence delirium without premedication midazolam . Emergence delirium evaluate use validate pediatric delirium scale . The Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium ( PAED ) scale test reliability validity 50 child 5 . Study Design We plan explore question randomize double blind trial acupuncture child undergo myringotomy tube placement . Patients randomize receive either acupuncture immediately anesthesia induction ( A ) receive standard anesthetic care ( S ) . Patients , family member recovery registered nurse ( RNs ) know acupuncture perform . The researcher observe patient PACU also blind whether subject received acupuncture . Intraoperative anesthetic technique standardize , include administer usual pain medication ketorolac 0.5mg/kg give intramuscularly patient prior emergence . Needles place anesthesia induction remove prior leave operating room . A total 4 needle place , one wrist HT7 point one ear shen men point . Emergence delirium assess Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium ( PAED ) scale . A follow phone call make first post-operative day ( POD # 1 ) . We assess continued emergence delirium discharge PACU , well brief assessment sleeping pattern night surgery . A second follow-up phone call make one week surgery . During call , ask child 's behavior sleep pattern since time surgery . We know institution 's actual incidence emergence delirium operation . We assume 25 % suggested literature . We know effect pre-medication midazolam incidence emergence delirium . We assume standard deviation 4 , value consistent current publish literature . By enrol 100 subject detect difference score least 2.5 point . This enrollment give u 80 % power alpha 0.05 . Since distribution score wo n't normal , enrollment target also include 15 % increase allow non-parametric distribution result . Group ( A ) group ( S ) 50 child .</detailed_description>
