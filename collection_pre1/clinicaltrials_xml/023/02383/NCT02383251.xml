	<brief_title>Paclitaxel/Pazopanib Platinum Resistant/Refractory Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard treatment : - In Europe , advance ovarian cancer patient treat first line optimal debulking surgery follow carboplatin/paclitaxel regimen plus bevacizumab chemotherapy maintenance total à 15 month . The addition bevacizumab standard patient residual disease . - The addition bevacizumab carboplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy also recently approve patient platinum sensible relapse [ Aghajanian , 2012 ] . The bevacizumab maintain progression . Rationale use anti-angiogenic agent early relapse : - The recent AURELIA trial compare paclitaxel , topotecan liposomal doxorubicin alone versus combine bevacizumab early failure first-line carboplatin/paclitaxel reveal target angiogenesis beneficial recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer [ Pujade-Lauraine , 2012 2013 ] , high progression-free survival ( PFS ) . Thus , strategy inhibit angiogenesis recurrent resistant-platinum ovarian cancer promising . - The recent change standard treatment first line platinum-sensible relapse patient ovarian cancer highlight question inhibit angiogenesis relapse during/after bevacizumab maintenance . In last situation , strategy continuation antiangiogenesis therapy , change chemotherapy despite recurrence , show benefit type cancer ( colon , lung ) . In ovarian cancer , study perform answer question . In Aurelia trial , However , patient previously receive bevacizumab . The choice best antiangiogenic agent alternative bevacizumab need assess . Small molecular inhibitor tyrosine-protein-kinases ( TK ) could use efficacy first-line antiangiogenesis treatment demonstrate renal cancer [ Escudier , 2011 ] . - Pazopanib oral , potent multi-targeted small-molecule inhibitor VEGF-receptor TKs ( VEGFR-1 -2 -3 PDGFR c-KIT ; first target small molecule demonstrate important activity ovarian cancer . At ASCO 2013 , AGO-OVAR16 trial maintenance pazopanib first line ovarian cancer show benefit progression free survival ( difference 5.6 month median PFS favour pazopanib compare placebo ) [ Dubois , ASCO 2013 LBA5503 ] ; trial , majority patient residual disease patient receive bevacizumab . - In ovarian cancer , standard treatment patient relapse bevacizumab maintenance ( 15 20 % patient ) still mono-chemotherapy . Weekly paclitaxel one oh commonly use chemotherapy situation early relapse . However , promise result pazopanib first line lead develop protocols second-line combination chemotherapy . The combination weekly paclitaxel pazopanib feasible dose propose phase 2 study pazopanib 800 mg daily paclitaxel 65 mg/m2 day 1 , 8 , 15 every 28 day [ Tan , oncologist 2010 ] . The dosage paclitaxel justify result previous study , demonstrate co-administration pazopanib paclitaxel increase systemic exposure paclitaxel . An Italian group close phase 2 study ( MITO11 ) evaluate association among ovarian patient early relapse . In study , patient receive previously bevacizumab . Thus , pazopanib best molecule associate chemotherapy ovarian cancer patient early relapse treatment include bevacizumab . We propose randomized phase 2 trial evaluate combination pazopanib weekly paclitaxel among patient platine resistant relapse treatment include bevacizumab maintenance</detailed_description>
