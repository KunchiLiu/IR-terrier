	<brief_summary>TRIAL SUMMARY Researchers National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) enrol patient phase 2 clinical trial determine whether yeast-brachyury vaccine GI-6301 improve effectiveness radiation patient localized chordoma . Chordoma patient inoperable residual tumor metastasis plan treat definitive ( &gt; 70Gy ) radiation eligible participate . Patients initially randomize receive radiation plus vaccine radiation plus blinded placebo . Those randomized receive radiation plus placebo option receive vaccine tumor grow study . The study compare outcomes patient treated radiation without vaccine determine whether vaccine increase chance shrink tumor and/or prevent tumor growth . WHY THIS TRIAL IS BEING DONE The primary treatment option chordoma currently consist surgery high dose radiation . Radiation show improve patient outcome follow surgery . Radiation also sometimes use instead surgery surgery would carry unacceptable risk . The chance tumor growth radiation significantly high patient residual tumor whose tumor completely remove . Unfortunately patient tumor completely remove , tend short time tumor grow back eventually cause death . For reason , team NCI seek identify therapy reduce risk recurrence improve survival radiation patient residual tumor . One approach pursue treat patient therapeutic vaccine intend stimulate immune system fight cancer cell express brachyury protein . Brachyury present high level nearly chordomas present vast majority normal tissue , make promising target immune therapy . Research cancer suggest radiation combination immune therapy provide powerful antitumor effect . We recently complete phase 1 clinical trial therapeutic vaccine target brachyury call GI-6301 11 chordoma patient participate . Through phase I trial , learn vaccine give safely without serious adverse reaction . In study , vaccine also capable induce immune response brachyury one patient tumor shrink 30 % study . Some patient ( 7 10 evaluable ) also stable disease 5 month study . However , clinical finding definitive clinical testing require determine benefit vaccine chordoma . To end , design large phase 2 clinical trial intend determine vaccine , give combination radiation , improve outcome patient chordoma compare radiation . WHO CAN PARTICIPATE We design trial patient residual tumor remain surgery , unable surgery , local recurrence follow previous treatment . To eligible enrollment study , patient must : - Have confirm diagnosis chordoma - Have localize tumor ( metastasis ) - Be able receive least 70 Gy radiation localize tumor - Be willing travel Bethesda , MD treatment follow-up visit HOW THE TRIAL WILL WORK The trial take place National Institutes Health Clinical Center Bethesda , MD . The NCI pay transportation cost ( include airfare ) portion lodge cost patient enrollment study . The process participate trial follow : - Patients travel NIH receive injection vaccine ( placebo ) every week three dose prior start radiation ( approximately 4 week ) - Patients complete radiation treatment home radiation oncologist ( typically 1-2 month timespan ) - Following completion radiation treatment plan , patient travel back NIH resume vaccine ( placebo ) injection every 2 week 6 total dos give ( 3 dos radiation , another 4 week ) - At point , dos spread every 4 week 4 dos , 1 dose every 3 month disease progression . - Between dos vaccine , patient may return home travel back next visit . There requirement stay locally Bethesda point study outside clinic visit dose day . - Repeat image study perform 3 month completion radiatio ...</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The National Cancer Institute Opens A Randomized , Double-Blind , Phase 2 Trial GI-6301 ( Yeast-Brachyury Vaccine ) Versus Placebo Combination With Standard Care Definitive Radiotherapy Locally Advanced , Unresectable , Chordoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Chordoma rare disease , affect 3,000 people United States , 300 new case diagnose per year . - Brachyury member T-box family transcription factor , characterize highly conserve DNA-binding domain designate T-domain . - Brachyury express universally chordoma cell . - GI-6301 ( Yeast-brachyury vaccine ) demonstrate immunogenicity tolerable acceptable safety profile phase 1 trial . - Brachyury specific T cell lyse human cancer cell express brachyury MHC restrict manner . - There indication clinical benefit patient chordoma enrolled phase I trial GI-6301 . A ) 1 Partial Response B ) 1 Mixed Response Chordoma patient receive Radiation C ) 6 9 patient progressive disease enrollment Stable Disease Day 85 restaging -In vitro , chordoma cell line kill significantly well brachyury-specific T cell radiation exposure use either proton beam gamma radiation . ENDPOINTS : PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : -To determine difference overall response rate ( ORR ) define complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) RECIST 1.1 24 month among patient Chordoma treat radiation plus placebo vs. radiation plus vaccine . ELIGIBILITY : - Patients least 18 year old locally advanced ( unresectable , non-metastatic ) chordoma eligible definitive radiotherapy treatment . - No history autoimmune disease - Measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 - Adequate organ function DESIGN : - Randomized , double-blind , placebo control phase 2 clinical trial radiation plus placebo vs. radiation plus yeast-brachyury vaccine patient chordoma . - Participants randomize 1:1 basis two arm - Participants assign placebo arm allow cross-over time confirm disease progression . - Participants evaluate objective response , progression free survival overall survival - Up 55 participant accrue study</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants must meet follow criterion participation : 1 . Diagnosis : Patients must histologically confirm chordoma Laboratory Pathology , NCI , localize ( evidence metastatic disease ) , unresectable must plan radiation therapy , least one target lesion evidence growth prior enrollment . The tentative radiation plan enrollment must compliance require radiation dos . This give standard hypofractionated dose technique deem appropriate treating radiation oncologist requirement meet . 2 . Patients must disease measurable RECIST version 1.1 . 3 . Fresh archive tumor specimen must available correlative study . 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 study entry ( Karnofsky great equal 70 ) 5 . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use GI6301 ( Yeast Brachyury vaccine ) patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . 6 . Prior Therapy : Patients must fully recover prior surgery enrollment . Prior radiation therapy allow provided radiation field safely irridated opinion treat radiation oncologist . 7 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Serum creatinine less equal 1.5 X upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance 24h urine collection great equal 60 mL/min . ALT AST less equal 3 X upper limit normal . Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 X upper limit normal OR patient Gilbert syndrome , total bilirubin less equal 3.0 . Hematological eligibility parameter ( within16 day start therapy ) : Granulocyte count great equal 1,500/mm3 Platelet count great equal 100,000/mm3 8 . Men woman childbearing potential must agree use effective birth control abstinence period 4 month last vaccination therapy . 9 . Patients must history yeast allergy . If patient questionable history allergy yeast , yeast skin test perform . Patients would eligible skin test negative . 10 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients follow eligible participation study : 1 . Patients evidence immune dysfunction list . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positivity due potential decrease immune response vaccine . Active autoimmune disease require treatment history autoimmune disease might stimulate vaccine treatment . This requirement due potential risk exacerbate autoimmunity .
