	<brief_summary>Breast cancer one prevalent cancer among woman , represent 20 - 25 % female cancer . Despite early diagnosis improvement adjuvant therapy , patient present metastatic recurrence . Treatment breast cancer determine extent disease . Early localize breast cancer treat combination surgery radiotherapy . Adjuvant systemic therapy , consist chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy , tumor deem hormone responsive , prolong disease-free interval improve overall survival . However , approximately 30 % 40 % patient early breast cancer ultimately relapse , either local recurrence distant metastasis , require systemic treatment advance disease . Since breast cancer recur progress initial treatment consider incurable , therapy option available advanced disease concerned disease control palliation symptom . Hormonal therapy become treatment choice postmenopausal woman hormone sensitive breast cancer . Even though treatment advance breast cancer postmenopausal woman improve introduction agent aromatase inhibitor , agent still limitation , disease management continue sub-optimal . The use systemic therapy hormonal therapy , chemotherapy new biological treatment reduce tumour mass , improve survival preserve quality life . Whatever initial efficacy treatment undertaken metastatic setting , almost every patient relapse . The main goal improve progression free survival ( PFS ) . To achieve , type chemotherapy , optimal duration chemotherapy , benefit maintenance chemotherapy , benefit maintenance hormonal treatment debatable .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The search prognostic predictive factor could influence survival patient treat metastatic breast cancer already subject several study . It seem 2 component natural outcome tumor must consider . The first category relate primary characteristic initial histological grade , hormonal receptor status . The second category link metastatic characteristic : proliferation index reflect length disease-free interval , type number metastatic site involve . On hand , prognostic factor link treatment undertaken , stress impact natural outcome disease : type hormonotherapy , type chemotherapy , type response achieve treatment . The impact factor remain debatable , duration treatment . The optimal duration chemotherapy patient respond stable disease identify . Definitively , major limit use prolong regimen chemotherapy relate toxicity , cumulative ( cardiac toxicity anthracyclins , neurologic toxicity taxanes , haematological cumulative toxicity chemotherapy… ) . The proposition give hormonal treatment prolong therapy hormonal-positive tumor another possible option . In literature , data focus strategy rare . One object choice patient/tumor characteristic would would receive maintenance hormonal therapy random , control way . This may lead selection good prognosis patient . Investigators know whether observe natural history impact trial . Nevertheless major impact obtain maintenance hormonal treatment first line chemotherapy might indicate strategy recommended patient ER PgR positive tumor . Based amplitude benefit observe , may ethically debatable conduct prospective randomize study . Moreover , randomize trial assess benefit new chemotherapy regimen allow possibility give maintenance hormonal treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically cytologically diagnosis breast cancer ; 2 . Presence metastatic disease either measureable nonmeasureable evaluable bone disease define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ; 3 . Diagnosis hormone receptor positive ( HR+ ) , HER2 negative breast cancer . To fulfill requirement HR+ disease , breast cancer must express , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , least one hormone receptor ( estrogen receptor [ ER ] , progesterone receptor [ PR ] ) . To fulfill requirement HER2 negative disease , breast cancer must demonstrate overexpression HER2 either IHC fluorescence insitu hybridization ( FISH ) ; 4 . Postmenopausal status time randomization . 5 . Previous treatment either antiestrogen aromatase inhibitor adjuvant metastatic disease allow ; 6 . Age &gt; 18 ; 7 . One line chemotherapy metastatic disease discontinue 2128 day . Patient response stability firstline chemotherapy . The patient may receive prior systemic chemotherapy neoadjuvant adjuvant setting ; 8 . Patients measurable evaluable disease accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria ; 9 . Performance Status ( ECOG ) &lt; 2 ; 10 . No brain metastases ; 11 . No clinically serious concurrent illness ; 12 . Adequate organ function 13 . Use bisphosphonates allow ; 14 . Use antiangiogenetic drug ( bevacizumab associate paclitaxel ) allow , discontinued 2128 day start study ; 15 . Life expectancy &gt; 12 week ; 16 . Are willing participate duration study follow study procedure ; 17 . Written inform consent prior studyspecific procedure Written inform consent ; 1 . Treatment drug receive regulatory approval indication within 2128 day randomization ; 2 . Drug ( chemotherapy biological drug ) end firstline chemotherapy maintenance phase ; 3 . Significant know cardiovascular impairment ( NYHA CHF &gt; grade 2 , unstable angina , myocardial infarction within previous 6 month prior randomization , exist serious cardiac arrhythmia ) . VECF ( Ventricular Ejection Cardiac Fraction ) ≤ 50 % ; 4 .
