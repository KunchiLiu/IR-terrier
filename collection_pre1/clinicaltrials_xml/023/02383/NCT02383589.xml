	<brief_summary>This Phase III , randomize , double-blind , double-dummy , active-comparator , parallel-arm , multicenter study evaluate efficacy safety rituximab compare MMF participant moderate-to-severely active PV require 60-120 milligram per day ( mg/day ) oral prednisone equivalent . Participants must confirm diagnosis PV within previous 24 month ( skin mucosal biopsy immunohistochemistry ) evidence active disease screening . Approximately 124 participant enrol 60 center worldwide . Participants randomize 1:1 ratio receive either rituximab plus MMF placebo rituximab placebo plus MMF . Randomization stratify duration illness . The study consist three period : screening period 28 day , 52-week double-blind treatment period , 48-week safety follow period begin time study treatment completion discontinuation .</brief_summary>
