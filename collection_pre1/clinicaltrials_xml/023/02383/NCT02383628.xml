	<brief_summary>The main objective study evaluate efficacy indocyanine green ( ICG ) endoscopy evaluate tissue perfusion endoscopic neurosurgery . This include patient pituitary intracranial tumor treatment vascular abnormality aneurysms compressive syndrome . ICG evaluate determine value additional visual information supply treatment pathology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Perfusion Utilizing ICG Fluorescence Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over past decade , technique widely use ophthalmologist assess retinal blood flow , near-infrared ICG angiography , applied neurosurgical patient undergo wide variety cerebrovascular procedure . This technique offer advantage real-time visualization cerebral blood flow operate microscope time procedure perform . Indocyanine green ideal agent image vessel tightly bound plasma albumin , short half-life , maintain acceptable safety profile . Furthermore , excitation emission profile ICG lie near-infrared wavelength , allow penetration imaging vessel millimeter tissue . Patients either aneurysm , compressive syndrome pituitary intracranial tumor enrol study . By take advantage natural fluorescence indocyanine green ( ICG ) within red spectrum apply light filter endoscope eyepiece camera show whether technique provide adequate visual information differentiate perfusion tumor surround structure evaluate normal vessel aneurysm compressive syndrome procedure .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient population would include patient pituitary tumor , intracranial tumor , aneurysms , normal tissue adjacent tumor clarify normal abnormal . Also , patient compressive syndrome ensure patency normal vessel . This would patient undergo endoscopic surgery , endonasal open ( retromastoid transcranial ) . Less 18 year age Iodine allergy Shellfish allergy Contrast allergy Previous anaphylactic reaction ICG Pregnant Anyone evidence renal hepatic dysfunction</criteria>
