	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well regorafenib gemcitabine hydrochloride work second-line therapy ( treatment give initial treatment n't work ) treat patient pancreatic cancer spread part body . Regorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving regorafenib together gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy ( progression-free survival ) regorafenib gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) previously treat patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety regorafenib combination gemcitabine . II . To assess response rate ( RR ) . III . To assess overall survival ( OS ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive regorafenib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
