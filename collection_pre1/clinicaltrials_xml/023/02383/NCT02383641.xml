	<detailed_description>Wolman disease rare genetic disorder characterize complete absence enzyme know lysosomal acid lipase ( LIPA LAL ) . This enzyme require breakdown ( metabolize ) lipid body . Without LIPA enzyme , lipid may abnormally accumulate tissue organ body cause variety symptom . Wolman disease may cause bloat swell stomach ( abdominal distention ) , vomit , significant hepatosplenomegaly . Life-threatening complication often develop early childhood . Wolman disease cause mutation lysosomal acid lipase ( LIPA ) gene . The disorder inherit autosomal recessive trait.Wolman disease severe expression LIPA deficiency . Milder form disorder know cholesteryl ester storage deficiency . The symptoms Wolman disease usually become apparent shortly birth , usually first week life . Affected infant may develop bloat abdominal distention may significant hepatosplenomegaly . Fibrosis liver may also occur . In case , fluid may accumulate abdominal cavity ( ascites ) .Infants Wolman disease serious digestive abnormality include malabsorption , condition intestine fail absorb nutrient calorie form food . Malabsorption associate Wolman disease cause persistent often forceful vomit , frequent diarrhea , foul-smelling , fatty stool ( steatorrhea ) malnutrition . Because digestive complication , affect infant usually fail grow gain weight expect rate age sex ( failure thrive ) . Hepatosplenomegaly protrusion abdomen cause umbilical hernia , condition content stomach may push abnormal opening tear abdominal wall near bellybutton . Additional symptom may also occur Wolman disease include yellow skin , mucous membrane white eye ( jaundice ) , persistent low-grade fever , poor muscle tone ( hypotonia ) . Infants may exhibit delay development motor skill . A distinct finding associate Wolman disease harden adrenal gland tissue due accumulation calcium ( calcification ) . The adrenal gland locate top kidney produce epinephrine norepinephrine . Other hormone produce adrenal gland help regulate fluid electrolyte balance body . Calcification adrenal gland detectable physical examination , see x-ray study . Calcification may prevent adrenal gland produce enough essential hormone affect metabolism , blood pressure , immune system vital process body . Infants Wolman disease may experience loss previously acquire skill require coordination muscle motor skill ( psychomotor regression ) . The symptoms Wolman disease often get progressively worse eventually lead life-threatening complication infancy include extremely low level circulate red blood cell ( severe anemia ) , hepatic dysfunction failure , physical waste away severe weakness often associate chronic disease mark weight loss loss muscle mass ( cachexia inanition ) . Wolman disease cause mutation lysosomal acid lipase ( LIPA ) gene . It inherit autosomal recessive trait . Genetic disease determine combination gene particular trait chromosome receive father mother . The LIPA gene contains instruction produce enzyme lysosomal lipase acid . This enzyme essential metabolizing certain fat body , especially cholesterol ( specifically cholesteryl ester ) lesser degree triglyceride . Without proper level enzyme , fat abnormally accumulate damage various tissue organ body . Mutations LIPA gene result lack production LIPA enzyme production defective , inactive form LIPA enzyme . Wolman disease extremely rare disorder affect male female equal number . More 50 case report medical literature . However , case may go undiagnosed misdiagnosed make difficult determine disorder 's true frequency general population . Wolman disease name one physician first identify disorder medical literature 1956 . Symptoms follow disorder similar Wolman disease . Comparisons may useful differential diagnosis . Cholesteryl ester storage disease ( CESD ) rare genetic disorder characterize deficiency inactivity enzyme know lysosomal acid lipase ( LIPA ) . This enzyme require breakdown ( metabolize ) certain fat ( lipid ) body . Deficiency LIPA enzyme cause fat abnormally accumulate tissue organ body potentially causing variety symptom . The symptom CESD vary greatly depend much residual enzyme activity remain . The key finding ( sometimes clinical sign ) abnormally enlarge liver ( hepatomegaly ) . Some individual may diagnose CESD adulthood . CESD cause different mutation gene [ lysosomal acid lipase ( LIPA ) gene ] cause Wolman disease . CESD inherit autosomal recessive trait . Niemann-Pick disease ( NPD ) group rare inherit disorder fat metabolism . At least five type Niemann-Pick disease identify ( NPD type A , B , C , D , E ) . Symptoms type A B occur result deficiency enzyme acid sphingomyelinase ( ASM ) , need break sphingomyelin , fatty substance find mostly brain nervous system . This deficiency result abnormal accumulation excessive amount sphingomyelin many organ body liver , spleen , brain . Symptoms type C occur impair traffic large molecule within cell , result accumulation excessive amount cholesterol glycosphingolipids tissue throughout body . The metabolic defect type C lead secondary reduction ASM activity cell . Symptoms common type Niemann-Pick disease include yellow discoloration skin , eye , and/or mucous membrane ( jaundice ) , progressive loss motor skill , feed difficulty , learn disability , hepatosplenomegaly . The different type Niemann-Pick disease inherit autosomal recessive trait . Chanarin Dorfman syndrome rare genetic disorder fat ( lipid ) metabolism . It characterize ichthyosis , myopathy , abnormal white blood cell small space ( vacuole ) fill lipid . Additional symptom may occur include hearing loss , vision abnormality , hepatomegaly condition fat accumulate liver ( liver steatosis `` fatty '' liver ) . Cognitive decline may occur case . Chanarin Dorfman syndrome inherit autosomal recessive trait . There several type metabolic disorder secondary accumulation certain triglyceride body . These disorder include galactosemia , fructose intolerance , specific disorder amino acid metabolism . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize specific metabolic alteration blood ( plasma ) affect patient allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study identify validate new biochemical marker plasma affect patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment . Examining saliva sample allow determine whether measurement feasible saliva sample promote early detection Wolman disease .</detailed_description>
