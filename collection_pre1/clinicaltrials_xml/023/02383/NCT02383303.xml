	<brief_summary>The U.S. Department Health Human Services , Administration Children Families ( ACF ) conduct experimental evaluation Assets Independence ( AFI ) Program . This evaluation—the first experimental evaluation Individual Development Account ( IDA ) project operate Assets Independence Act—will contribute importantly understanding effect IDA project IDA project feature participant . IDA program provide match fund participant saving withdraw spend qualified asset purchase , commonly homeownership , business-related expense , education . This study build prior quasi-experimental AFI evaluation , well study non-AFI fund Individual Development Account ( IDA ) project . While evaluation suggest IDAs help low-income family save , rigorous experimental research limit . No experimental evaluation AFI-funded program conduct date . Of quasi- non-experimental study , focus AFI-funded IDAs . The evaluation conduct two site , random assignment 299 AFI-eligible case one site 509 case , total 808 case . Each site randomly assign sample member one two group : control group treatment group receive conventional AFI service . The primary research question study seek answer : 1 . What impact AFI program participation outcome design address ( e.g. , saving asset purchase ) ? 2 . What impact AFI program participation outcome domains program might influence ( e.g. , material hardship , alternative financial product use , economic well-being ) ? 3 . How impacts AFI program participation vary time participant characteristic ? The study use two-armed ( treatment vs. control ) experimental design . This design allow first two question address use rigorous randomize approach . In addition impact study , evaluation include implementation study describe document AFI program design , implement operate participate grantee site time study . This information use provide context interpreting finding impact study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assets Independence Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Assets Independence ( AFI ) evaluation conduct two site . Both site locate major metropolitan area southwestern U.S. , serve client population 60-75 percent Hispanic . Both similar program feature : maximum saving period 24 month matchable saving amount $ 1,000 . Important estimate design feature difference , also key difference program parameter : require hour financial education IDA match rate . The site enrol sample within 19-month period January 2013 July 2014 . Sample member site randomly assign two equal-sized group : treatment group ( able enter site 's IDA program ) control group ( able enter ) . IMPACT STUDY The impact study primary quantitative component research . The data collection analysis provide estimate effect IDA participation short- long-term client outcome , measure 12-month , 36-month , 60-month follow-up period . Participant outcomes measured time random assignment 12 , 36 , 60 month random assignment . Measures pertain short-term program effect include amount saving material hardship avoidance . These effect likely emerge within first year . Additional measure include employment status , earnings , means-tested public benefit receipt , net worth . In long-term , effect homeownership , business ownership , secondary education attainment likely emerge . An unexplored area short-term effect IDAs use unmatched saving meet emergency need . In early stage AFI participation , household may establish saving habit may need draw saving unexpected expenditure offset unanticipated drop income . The hypothesized effect unmatched withdrawal IDA deposit avoidance material hardship food health . This effect estimate use small set household-level survey question , include item draw adult well-being topical module Survey Income Program Participation ( SIPP ) . RTI International develop web-based sample enrollment tool IDA project staff site use administer informed consent , baseline questionnaire , random assignment study-eligible applicant . The study 's 30-minute baseline questionnaire gather information follow survey module : demographic , use financial service , current residence , employment , household income expense , financial experience asset , debt , material hardship , social engagement outlook , locate information ( purpose re-contacting respondent follow-up survey ) . Site-provided administrative data provide additional baseline covariates ( treatment case ) descriptive information IDA opening , deposit , withdrawal ( match unmatched ) , balance . Note person-level measure specific `` primary household member '' : first individual his/her household apply IDA program study enrollment period . This person respondent baseline questionnaire follow-up survey . If ( secondary ) member household subsequently apply enter site 's IDA program , separately subject random assignment ( add sample count ) regard assigned sample group ( treatment control ) primary member . Household-level outcome measure household primary member belongs . The follow-up survey obtain outcome contextual measure . The survey take 30 minute conduct via telephone , web , in-person interviewer . The respondent primary sample member , individual apply enter AFI project complete informed consent form baseline questionnaire . The survey obtain data outcome measure , within topical heading show earlier baseline questionnaire . The estimation program impact use conventional multivariate regression technique appropriate statistical property dependent variable ( continuous , dichotomous , multinomial ) . For outcome measure , key parameter estimate coefficient randomly assign ( treatment versus control ) status case . This coefficient indicate regression-adjusted treatment-control difference measure outcome . All estimate equation include covariates measure baseline questionnaire . The program effect estimate intent-to-treat ( ITT ) effect , compare outcome control group case treatment group case , regardless whether treatment case open IDA account . Stated otherwise , procedure yield estimate effect offer IDA participation , treatment group member open IDAs . We also estimate treatment-on-the-treated ( TOT ) effect ( i.e. , impact program complete ) . In address first research question——the impact AFI participation outcome design address ( e.g. , saving asset purchase ) —we estimate program effect separately site well pooled sample combine data site . The pooled sample data provide study 's precise single estimate program effect , fully utilize available sample observation . The second research question—regarding effect outcome domains program might influence ( e.g. , material hardship , alternative financial product use , economic well-being ) —will also address estimate effect pool sample separately site . Under research question 3 test differential program impact participant subgroup . The subgroups interest identify baseline data . We anticipate subgroup reflect difference age , initial income level , initial indebtedness , initial education level , initial homeownership status . IMPLEMENTATION STUDY The implementation study describe document AFI project design , implement , operate participate grantee site . This information provide context understanding finding impact analysis . The main data collection approach involve site visit AFI grantee include interview key administrator , staff , stakeholder ; observation grantee service ; review relevant document data . The site visit select AFI grantee two day occur 2014 . While site , conduct semi-structured in-person interview individual differ role obtain range perspective AFI project , include IDA grantee staff , financial education provider , representative partner organization . The interview examine issue relate design implementation AFI project , challenge project face strategy overcome , factor may capture quantitative analysis may affect project outcomes . Questions design implementation draw information gather site selection , site training , initial random assignment , monitor call , cover whether , , project change occur . Through site selection on-site interview staff , obtain information organizational stability capacity , level IDA project complexity , number staff amount staff involvement , participant recruitment . Specific question include : What outreach activity conduct inform individual IDA project ? What form program support provide IDA accountholders ? How often AFI project staff touch participant open account ? What non-IDA program service available member comparison group organization ? Do feel important effect ( positive negative ) AFI project participant beyond measure outcome track evaluation ? In addition ask respondent challenge face , interview IDA project administrator staff probe challenge help participant attain realistic saving goal , navigate requirement diverse funding source requirement , raise nonfederal fund , cop limited fund administrative cost . The interview also explore external factor special circumstance may affect project outcomes . This information vital interpreting impact analysis finding generalizability finding sit . It fundamentally important understand program result estimated effect participant whether effect could replicate elsewhere . Finally , interview give respondent opportunity identify intangible outcome , whether positive negative , feel significant may capture formal impact analysis , help identify participant story share . During site visit , observed financial education class project-participant interaction capture actually happen project service delivery . Observations guide predetermined topic map specific study issue , observer unobtrusive possible . The observation provide insight particular project aspect may influence participant outcome . The implementation study also include document review understand AFI project administrative structure project design may influence project outcome . Written documentation number roles staff volunteer involve IDA project organization , project rule , overall project goal objectives set context identifying variable could affect participant outcome . Project communication material provide project participant , recruitment flyer , orientation material , program welcome letter , collect understand project message . In addition , obtain data project collect , data service take-up .</detailed_description>
