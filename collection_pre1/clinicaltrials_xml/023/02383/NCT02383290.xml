	<brief_summary>Certain part gene predict individual person respond medication ( pharmacogenetics ) . We invite 250 individual give sample saliva . This sample send laboratory limited genomic analysis relate pharmacogenetics . When personal data hold participant , family physician , pharmacist join genetic data personalize prescription recommendation form . The family physicians/pharmacists view recommendation electronic record . This result prescription may beneficial cause few adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We wish develop test decision support tool , TreatGx . Using genetic information ( single nucleotide polymorphism - SNPs ) patient biophysical characteristic tool creates drug dose recommendation . Each year Canada , approximately 200,000 severe adverse drug event , claim 10,000 22,000 life , cost $ 13.7 $ 17.7 billion . Physicians predict whether patient gain desire benefit prescribed medication whether experience harmful side effect . Genetic test may reduce potential harm many medication ; however currently way incorporate genetic information routine prescribing process . We see need pilot test , genetic base , prescribe decision support ( TreatGx ) feasibility usability . Five Family Physicians one pharmacy invite participate . They request identify total 250 adult chronic disease participate study . Each participant invite give saliva sample SNP test . This sample sent laboratory genetic testing ; whole genome test undertaken . We identify publish evidence small panel SNPs give information guide prescribing . A genetic report feed back family physician 's pharmacist 's electronic health record . The electronic health record link TreatGx ; next time participant see family physician/pharmacist prescribe recommendation available use . The family physician able use TreatGx give participant prescription personalize . We track many time system use , gain feedback usability , record timing receive sample , time laboratory , time analysis , time electronic record .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>People attend specify pharmacy Family Physicians . Aged 18 year , chronic disease require medication . Chronic disease include : gout , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , depression , osteoarthritis , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , atrial fibrillation , asthma , osteoporosis epilepsy .
