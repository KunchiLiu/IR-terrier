	<detailed_description>Feasibility Pilot A feasibility pilot Thiwáhe Gluwáš'akapi ( TG ) program conduct Spring 2015 . In pilot , intervention deliver two group youth family implementation process carefully evaluate determine work well adaptation intervention study procedure may necessary . Particular attention pay retention family , possible , drop interview understand barrier participation . As intervention evaluation ( see ) youth age 10-14 recruited participate , along parent and/or adult ( 3 adult per child ) actively involve raising ( e.g. , grandparent , aunt , uncle ) . Pilot group conduct two different community reservation . Once feasibility pilot complete , intervention finalize efficacy evaluation . Tasks phase include refine manual intervention develop train material interventionists . Implementation/Component Evaluation The formal evaluation TG begin fall 2015 utilize principle Multiphase Optimization Strategy ( MOST ; Collins et al. , 2009 ) intervention development fractional factorial design evaluate relative effectiveness different component within intervention . Three component evaluate : ( 1 ) A Lakota language enhancement ( Lakota ) , ( 2 ) Facebook social medium enhancement ( FB ) , ( 3 ) substance use resistance skill content ( SU ) . A total 24 intervention group randomly assign one 4 MOST design condition , content condition determine use SAS PROC FACTEX , recommend Collins , et al , 2009 . All 4 condition consist basic TG program , supplement one 3 component designate : Condition A include substance use resistance content ( SU ; Lakota FB ) ; Condition B include FB social medium supplement ( FB ; Lakota SU ) ; Condition C include Lakota language enhancement ( Lakota ; FB SU ) ; Condition D include three component ( Lakota + FB + SU ) . A cumulative evidence design utilized , intervention implement 5 cohort across 3 year . The intervention deliver 4 group ( 8 family ) Cohort 1 fall 2015 . Additional cohort receive intervention fall spring 2017 follow : Cohort 2 , Spring 2016 , 4 group ; Cohort 3 , Fall 2016 , 6 group ; Cohort 4 , Spring 2017 , 6 group ; Cohort 5 , Fall 2017 , 4 group . Thus , end 2017 , 24 intervention group ( 8 family , total 192 family ) participate TG program . Cohorts randomly assign 4 MOST design condition order control potential order implementation effect . Power analysis Power analyse suggest design result adequate power ( &gt; .80 ) detect small effect ( d=.15 ) 48 family per condition ; 4 condition design , require total 192 family ( include 16 pilot family ) . TG , follow Iowa Strengthening Families Program ( ISFP ) recommendation , deliver family group 8 family ; thus , order involve 192 family , plan total 24 intervention group , 6 4 experimental condition . Each component target evaluation implement 2 4 condition ( see condition A-B ) , estimate effect thus base marginal Ns 96 family . As standard MOST design , no-intervention control group group receive every component . While different approach randomize control trial ( RCT ) design , rigorous optimal approach identify effective component include intervention . The intervention create use process ready standard RCT evaluation , likely proven effective . Implementation evaluation Fidelity across implementation ensure use detailed manual procedure , provide extensive training interventionists , use fidelity log asses delivery key session component . The intervention director , clinical psychologist , observe session periodically verify extent implementation occur fidelity TG program manual . Efficacy evaluation The primary impetus development implementation TG program desire reduce risk substance abuse problem among American Indian adolescent prevent early initiation substance use . Assessment success TG program component hinge observed impact substance use initiation putative mediator parental self-efficacy , strengthen family relationship , cultural knowledge value . Given short timeline outcome evaluation ( limited 6 month post-intervention ) , effect mediator anticipate strong distal effect behavioral outcome . Measures Measures use ass study outcome draw heavily investigator ' previous research young American Indian adolescent parent , previous evaluation Iowa Strengthening Families Program Parents Youth 10-14 . Two instrument use assess array outcome expect affected TG intervention , along demographic data : Parent Survey ( parent caregiver participate TG program youth ) , Youth Survey . Both Parent Survey Youth Survey administer electronically , use tablet computer connect Internet , data upload directly . In addition , Social Network Survey administer ( either electronic tablet paper ) participate parents/caregivers ; survey design assess strength connection among participant program , participation program . A small number participant ( 3-4 ) group assign FaceBook condition ask participate Exit Interviews ( phone ) ascertain use response social medium message provide TG session . Data also capture Facebook , include page visit , post , response online quizzes . Finally , participant ask complete Program Evaluation Form ( Parent Youth version , paper ) last TG session , provide feedback program facilitator . Data Collection Schedule Time 1 - One week prior first TG session : Parent Youth survey ( participant ) . Time 2 - First TG session : Social Network Surveys ( adult ) . Time 3 - One week last TG session : Parent Youth Surveys ( participant ) ; Social Network Survey ( adult ) Time 4 - Within two week final TG session : FaceBook Exit Interviews ( 3-4 adult participant condition include FaceBook supplement ) Time 5 - Approximately 6 month last TG session : Parent Youth Surveys ( participant first two intervention cohort ) Analyses The simplest analyse evaluation TG program , use MOST design , involve analysis variance ( ANOVA ) , use fractional factorial design describe , compare post-intervention value ( Time 3 Time 5 ) mediator outcomes across condition ( assume randomization across condition result roughly equivalent pre-intervention value ) . Repeated measure ANOVA also perform , include pre- post-intervention measure , look interaction time condition . Finally , multivariate ANOVAs estimate group outcome variable , examine pattern effect across outcome . For analysis , focus effect size ( rather significance test p value ) compare effect size across component guide decision retain optimized TG intervention . As noted , standard error adjust account intraclass correlation cluster family within intervention group . Analyses Social Network Measure focus assess density cohesion network level , address two primary question : First , network characteristic begin program ( pre-existing relationship within intervention group ) modify effect TG intervention within group , second , network characteristic change course TG intervention new relationship form exist relationship change . Analyses conduct use UCINET similar social network analysis software . Analyses Facebook data primarily descriptive , examine frequency participant engage Facebook page TG group post comment , respond poll quizzes . Exploratory analysis may use examine correlation group rate Facebook use group-level outcome , increase cohesion measure Social Network Analysis . Analyses Facebook Exit Interviews primarily notes-based content analysis involve three major stage analysis : open coding , axial coding , selective coding .</detailed_description>
