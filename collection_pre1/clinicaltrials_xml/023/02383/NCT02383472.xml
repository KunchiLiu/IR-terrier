	<brief_summary>A double blind randomize trial light-emitting diode ( LED ) therapy patient suffer mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) . Patients see Sports Concussion Clinic cognitive symptom last great 4 week randomize either placebo therapy ( control ) treatment LED therapy ( case ) . Both case control would complete post-concussion symptom scale Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System ( D-KEFS ) , ImPACT study entry study week 3 6 , early symptom resolve end 6 week period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Concussion , also know mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) , result rotational acceleration brain . The biomechanical force cause concussion lead open ion channel within neuronal cell membrane , allow massive influx sodium efflux potassium . This result spread depression type phenomenon , lead depolarization neuron diffusely throughout brain.19 In order restore homeostatic ion gradient across membrane , sodium-potassium pump require increase amount adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . Thus , increase need ATP concussion . ATP supply glycolysis glucose blood stream . Both experimental model concussion human study , however , show decreased cerebral blood flow initial response injury . Thus , increased demand ATP concussion ; diminish supply glucose meet demand . The absorption light red/near infrared wavelength spectrum cytochrome C oxidase increase ATP synthesis . Thus , increase ATP synthesis , red/near infrared LEDs treat underlie pathophysiological cause concussion symptom . If successful , would first therapy directly treat underlie pathophysiology concussion .</detailed_description>
