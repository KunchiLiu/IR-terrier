	<brief_summary>Saphenous nerve block technically challenge . Recently describe ultrasound technique improve success rate saphenous nerve block , randomize control trial compare technique lack . The investigator compare two common ultrasound guide approach saphenous nerve block : saphenous nerve block adductor canal ( ACSNB ) vs. block distal trans-sartorial ( DTSNB ) approach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Different Ultrasound Guided Techniques Saphenous Nerve Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive either ACSNB DTSNB prospective randomize , blind , non-inferiority clinical trial . The primary objective show non-inferiority ACSNB DTSNB term block success . Secondary outcome measure time require perform block , time onset successful block , visibility nerve use ultrasound . Sample size calculation : To address primary objective study -- show non-inferiority ACSNB DTSNB term success define above- investigator use test non-inferiority two proportion . DTSNB primary technique saphenous nerve block investigator ' institution . From chart review electronic record 2011 2012 , investigator find 3 % incidence rescue block among saphenous nerve block ( 19 667 block ) institution . This assumed success rate approximately 97 % . A study Saranteas et al report success rate 95.6 % healthy volunteer undergo saphenous nerve block exit adductor canal . Based two observation , investigator expect success rate DTSNB 95 % . To establish non-inferiority ACSNB DTSNB , investigator pre-determined success rate ACSNB low 85 % ( expect difference proportion less ( 95 % - 85 % ) 10 % ) . Under assumption , achieve 80 % power , one-sided type I error rate 0.05 , study need 59 subject per group ; 118 patient total . 120 patient enrolled study. , randomize receive either ACSNB ( n=58 ) DTSNB ( n=62 ) .To show non-inferiority ACSNB DTSNB , upper 95 % confidence bound success rate ( πDTSNB - πACSNB ) less 10 % . The normality continuous variable test Shapiro Wilk 's test . Based normality assumption , two independent sample t-test Mann-Whitney U test perform continuous variable . Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test perform categorical variable .</detailed_description>
