	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation Carestream PRO 3543 PRO 3543C Digital Detectors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose clinical study evaluate imaging performance investigational device compare currently market predicate device . The evaluation consist primarily compare diagnostic image quality pediatric adult cadaver study adult live human subject study acquire exposure technique . Under position radiological technique , pediatric adult cadaver study , adult live human subject study , use double-exposed image acquire evaluate diagnostic image quality investigational device versus predicate device . Target image assemble review side-by-side Comparative Evaluation statistically confirm finding evaluation . The live human subject portion study perform healthy volunteer . Each volunteer sign Informed Consent two ( 2 ) x-ray taken.The first x-ray follow standard technique use cleared predicate detector currently use site . Following first x-ray , take one additional x-ray part body one ( 1 ) investigational detector . The x-ray investigational detector use diagnose . If x-ray obtained standard DR x-ray detector show unforeseen , unusual abnormal finding , finding communicate subject doctor USPS mail . Reason Observational Study Type : There three ( 3 ) physical detector use study . Each detector 35 centimeter 43 centimeter . None subject give detector . All subject healthy volunteer recruit flyer . All subject image predicate detector one ( 1 ) investigational detector .</detailed_description>
