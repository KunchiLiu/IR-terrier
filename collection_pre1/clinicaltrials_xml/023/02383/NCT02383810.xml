	<detailed_description>This randomize , stratify , double-blind , double-dummy , parallel group , placebo-controlled , dose finding , multicentre , multinational , phase II study patient colorectal cancer receive 5- Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) -based chemotherapy ( FOLFOX -FOLinic acid , Fluorouracil , OXaliplatin chemotherapy regimen - FOLFIRI - FOLinic acid , Fluorouracil , IRInotecan chemotherapy regimen ) . Patients receive , start day chemotherapy administration , single daily dose subcutaneously ( s.c. ) elsiglutide 10 , 20 40 mg placebo 4 consecutive day . Each patient study 3 consecutive chemotherapy cycle . The treatment period patient 4 consecutive day first 2 chemotherapy cycle . Randomization perform 1:1:1:1 treatment allocation stratify chemotherapy regimen country . Two population plan study . The population receive FOLFOX FOLFIRI without monoclonal antibody define Target population , population concomitantly receive monoclonal antibody define Additional population . Randomization Target Additional population handle independently . Primary Objective : To compare efficacy 3 s.c. dos elsiglutide versus ( vs. ) placebo vs. dose prevention CID colorectal cancer patient treat 5-FU base chemotherapy ( FOLFOX FOLFIRI ) addition monoclonal antibody . Secondary Objectives : - As secondary objective , efficacy 3 s.c. dos elsiglutide vs. placebo vs. dose prevention CID colorectal cancer patient treat 5-FU base chemotherapy ( FOLFOX FOLFIRI ) give combination monoclonal antibody explore . - Safety tolerability administer repeated dos elsiglutide evaluate . Additionally follow secondary objective explore : - The pharmacokinetics ( PK ) elsiglutide , metabolites patient consent undergo exposure assessment first administration steady state . The influence possible demographic therapeutic covariates PK parameter variability also investigate . The possible relationship exposure elsiglutide metabolites efficacy measure target overall population explore . - The economic impact 3 dos elsiglutide vs. placebo dose treatment CID . - The impact patient 's QoL ( quality life ) different dosage vs. placebo .</detailed_description>
