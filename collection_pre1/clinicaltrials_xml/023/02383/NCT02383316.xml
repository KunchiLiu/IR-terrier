	<brief_summary>Noonan syndrome ( NS ) rare genetic disease ( incidence 1/2500 live birth ) characterize association craniofacial manifestation , cardiopathy , short stature , tumor predisposition . The genetic cause Noonan Syndrome mutation gene involve Ras/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases ( MAPK ) pathway , mainly gene encode tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 ( 50 % patient ) .Shp2 appear involve many facet energy metabolism control ( glucose homeostasis , adipose tissue functionâ€¦ ) , mechanism poorly understood . Several metabolic anomaly ( reduce adiposity , improve glucose tolerance ) recently identify original mouse model carry Shp2 mutation . Moreover , recent clinical survey show adult Noonan Syndrome patient protect developping overweight obesity compare general population . However , metabolic status associate Noonan Syndrome condition explore date .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Metabolic Modifications Children With Noonan Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Differential hormone sensitivity associate Noonan Syndrome participate development symptom . The investigator demonstrate MAPK upregulation Noonan Syndrome responsible partial growth hormone ( GH ) insensitivity , subsequent growth retardation . Clinical trait evocative energy metabolism dysfunction recently report Noonan Syndrome patient , although origin consequence metabolic change document date . The aim study explore metabolic status child Noonan Syndrome . Children Noonan Syndrome compare age- sex-matched healthy child . The investigator hypothesize Noonan Syndrome child increase insulin sensitivity compare GHD child . Study parameter collect include : clinical measurement ( height , weight , body mass index , waist circumference , blood pressure ) , glucose insulin level baseline oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , body composition measure dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) . The study include one visit .</detailed_description>
