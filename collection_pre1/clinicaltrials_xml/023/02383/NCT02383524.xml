	<brief_summary>The Investigators design exploratory study patient suffer zygapophysial joint mediate pain investigate correlation exist inter-individual genetic variability ( genotype ) treatment response ( phenotype ) . More specifically , investigator aim identify form correlation specific SNP BDNF gene ( Val66Met ) effectiveness and/or duration radiofrequency facet joint neurotomy . The study population patient suffer chronic low back pain scheduled radiofrequency neurotomy follow diagnosis facet joint mediate pain ( use medial branch block test ) . The investigator evaluate common variant BDNF gene ( Val66Met ) directly correlate significant degree pain relief follow RF treatment , whether result procedure predict specific genetic profile .</brief_summary>
