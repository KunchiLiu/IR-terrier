	<brief_title>Modified Diet Trial : A Study SMT C1100 Paediatric Patients With DMD Who Follow Balanced Diet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To determine plasma concentration SMT C1100 calculate time point subject ( sample size ( n ) , mean , standard deviation ( SD ) , percentage coefficient variation ( % CV ) , geometric mean , median , minimum , maximum parent major metabolite ) . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine safety tolerability single multiple oral dos SMT C1100 patient Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ) assess participant adverse event , ECG result , vital sign laboratory test . 2 . To evaluate diurnal variability steady state PK SMT C1100 calculate time point subject ( sample size ( n ) , mean , standard deviation ( SD ) , percentage coefficient variation ( % CV ) , geometric mean , median , minimum , maximum parent major metabolite ) . 3 . To evaluate reduction creatine phosphokinase potential pharmacodynamic ( PD ) marker SMT C1100 activity clinical benefit .</detailed_description>
