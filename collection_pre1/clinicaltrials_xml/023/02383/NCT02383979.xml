In effort objectively demonstrate cortical reorganization associate mirror therapy , patient elect participate functional MRI ( fMRI ) portion study . The fMRI would evaluate prior initiate experimental control therapy ( Due sensitive timeline population effect recruitment , amend protocol allow recruitment enrollment take place even timeline allow fMRI execute 2 week prior amputation . Though would ideal , accept subject available day amputation scan ) , operative procedure , four week post-operation one year . All subject evaluate 4 week , 8 week ( functional physical therapy ( PT ) test ) 12 week , 12 month postoperatively determine 1 ) incidence , severity functional impact phantom limb pain 2 ) ability meet various specialist ' endpoint , include participation physical therapy , 3 ) overall quality life patient describe subjectively . This therapy could dramatic impact long term prognosis amputees whether due trauma , metabolic condition , tumor , peripheral vascular disease . This protocol include perform fMRIs cohort healthy , active duty , age match , male personnel create reference data compare fMRI data study participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects schedule amputation randomize either receive perioperative plasma ball ( sham ) mirror therapy , involve daily session 30 minute perform physical therapy exercise use either mirror plasma ball supervision certify physical therapist . Subjects schedule undergo limb amputation opt fMRI portion study undergo pre-treatment baseline fMRI ( 2 week prior schedule amputation , possible , late 1 day pre-operative ) , post-mirror sham therapy ( preoperative-day ) fMRI , post-operative fMRI 4 week one year . Performing baseline fMRI prior treatment , provide objective data regard location extent cortical involvement prior initiate mirror therapy . Those subject randomize mirror therapy limb undergo 14 day daily mirror therapy session preoperatively consist observe unaffected limb reflect 30 minute mirror position midline block view affect limb . Those randomized standard therapy participate equivalent period time undergoing sham therapy 22 '' plasma globe involve contralateral limb interaction sphere . All therapy session supervise physical therapist exception weekend patient continue therapy independent basis . The subject undergo repeat fMRI ( first baseline , depend pre-operative fMRI possible ) completion preoperative mirror sham therapy prior surgical amputation evaluate change suggestive mirror therapy induce normalization cortical pattern . Control subject group undergo 3 questionnaire one functional fMRI exam . Imaging protocol identical preoperative image protocol amputation subject . This data aid establish baseline fMR activation value fMR paradigms test . The control group randomize receive either perioperative plasma ball ( sham ) mirror therapy . All Subjects schedule surgery undergo amputation anesthetic technique provider choice . If regional/neuraxial anesthetic technique use standardized 1 day preoperative 3 day postoperative . If use dexmedetomidine and/or ketamine infusion , use limit intraoperative period dose 0.2 mcg/kg/hr 0.15mg/kg/hr limit respectively . Anesthesiologist/Anesthetist choice permit intraoperative postoperative med . Within 1 week amputation subject repeat 14 day respectively assign therapy limb describe addition routine post amputation care . All subject evaluate four week postoperatively measure delineate section 5 . ( Statistics ) determine 1 ) incidence severity phantom limb pain 2 ) participation therapy ability meet functional endpoint 3 ) quality life . These measure assess 12 week ( 3 month ) one year post procedure . A repeat fMRI obtain Subjects participate fMRI limb order evaluate postoperative cortical mapping compare prior preoperative postoperative study .</detailed_description>
