	<brief_title>Low Frequency Electrical Stimulation Fornix Intractable Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ( MTLE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low frequency stimulation attractive , uninvestigated method treatment intractable epilepsy . Preliminary animal human data suggest safety remarkable efficacy Low frequency stimulation ( LFS ) epilepsy . In addition , duty cycle LFS low , imply less electric current injection , less charge density target tissue electrode , long battery life . The current project classic translational , single-blinded , randomized research project , demonstrate clear path laboratory bedside . If successful , new therapy great value patient medically surgically intractable Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ( MTLE ) . The study expect last approximately 5 year , enrollment first patient completion final subject , take consideration attrition otherwise-eligible subject elect participate . Once study complete , enrol participant complete required element protocol , final report submit FDA . Participants may also discontinue participation study , wish , time .</detailed_description>
