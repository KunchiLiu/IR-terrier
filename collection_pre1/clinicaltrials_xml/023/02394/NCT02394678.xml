	<brief_summary>Intraventricular haemorrhage ( IVH ) - bleed normal fluid space ( ventricle ) within brain - associate high risk death significant long-term disability . IVH lead increase pressure within head trigger inflammation swell surround brain . The ideal treatment IVH would rapidly relieve pressure safely remove much blood possible prevent injury brain . Currently , patient manage insert tube ventricle drain fluid outside help reduce pressure , address blood clot , naturally dissolve several day week . Furthermore , drain frequently block blood clot within . If occurs repeat operation require replace . Experimental treatment include infuse drug accelerate clot breakdown nonetheless still take number day process introduces risk infection fresh bleeding . Surgery remove blood clot hazardous , technically challenge , generally successful . Therefore , present time , none available option achieve state goal IVH treatment unmet need good intervention . In study investigator propose pilot novel instrument employ high pressure localise microjet water mechanically disrupt blood clot suck debris away . This technique highly successful reopen blocked artery heart , importantly , without damage underlying vessel lining . In context IVH , allow rapid removal blood ventricle cause minimal trauma brain . Clearing blood early prevent build-up pressure inflammation , improve chance patient make good recovery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rheolytic Thrombectomy For Adult Intraventricular Haemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intraventricular Haemorrhage Approximately 30 % case spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage severe head injury complicate intraventricular haemorrhage ( IVH ) . Typically , IVH result extension deep intracerebral haemorrhage ( ICH ) aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage ( SAH ) , though third patient may primary IVH confine solely ventricular system . In absence demonstrable angiographic abnormality IVH usually associate deranged coagulation vascular risk factor hypertension , diabetes , smoking . Both experimental clinical study clearly demonstrate independent effect volume haemorrhage death disability IVH . In animal , injection blood lateral ventricle exhibit dose-dependent increase risk fatality , early thrombolysis simulate IVH reduces severity neurological deficit . In retrospective report intracerebral haemorrhage patient series concomitant IVH consistently emerge risk factor great mortality poor functional outcome . Similarly , multivariate analysis data STICH FAST prospective randomise controlled trial ICH management provide conclusive evidence presence volume IVH significant independent risk factor mortality morbidity . The principal effect IVH mediate intracranial hypertension induction inflammation oedema periventricular white matter deep grey structure . Blood within ventricle block CSF pathways result sequence hydrocephalus , acute rise intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , reduce cerebral perfusion , risk ischaemia , potential brainstem herniation . Exposure ependymal line blood initiate inflammatory cascade leucocyte infiltration adjacent brain , ensue tissue injury , localise oedema , eventually generalise brain swelling . Late effect IVH include scar ventricle obstruction CSF absorption blood breakdown product , typically result chronic hydrocephalus necessitate permanent CSF diversion ( shunt ) . Current Management Intraventricular Haemorrhage The rapid onset deleterious effect IVH support rationale early intervention relieve hydrocephalus raise ICP , reduce blood load result inflammation oedema . In neurosurgical centre prevail treatment paradigm insertion ventricular catheter external drainage divert CSF reduce ICP , though limited efficacy large IVH expansion distortion ventricle haematoma play great role exert mechanical pressure obstruct CSF . Ventricular catheter also frequently block blood , necessitate repeat surgery replacement . Furthermore , mode treatment address inflammatory effect haematoma , may persist several day week complete reabsorption occur . Infusions urokinase recombinant tissue plasminogen activator via external drain accelerate clot lysis show promise , however , effect immediate serial treatment require , attendant risk infection rebleeding . Several author describe transcortical endoscopic surgical clot evacuation approach technically demand , limited success term volume haematoma remove , practicable emergency situation . Rheolytic Thrombectomy Rheolytic thrombectomy ( RT ) involve double-lumen endovascular catheter delivers multiple high-speed retrograde water jet create hydrodynamic recirculation vortex trap mechanically fragment adjacent thrombus , result debris evacuate via continuous aspiration lumen . Safety study show technique cause minimal denude vascular endothelium difference degree vessel injury compare traditional balloon thrombectomy . Clinically , RT principally apply endovascular extraction acute thrombus coronary artery result large randomise controlled trial testify favourable safety profile . RT also use successfully treat intracranial dural sinus thrombosis , acute internal carotid artery occlusion , recanalising block synthetic vascular graft . These attractive feature RT suggest may offer significant advantage conventional IVH treatment rapidly remove clot within ventricle single procedure , time cause minimal trauma ependymal lining brain . This study evaluate feasibility , safety , efficacy RT therapy adult IVH . Rationale There unmet need intervention direct early clot removal follow IVH . RT proven effective safe intravascular thrombectomy feature suggest potential similarly successful treatment IVH . A pilot study indicate establish feasibility safety precursor large clinical trial . Ethical Considerations Patients participate trial suffer major intracranial haemorrhage poor prospect favourable neurological recovery even maximal current treatment . In situation , potential benefit RT outweigh foreseeable risk balance favour offering study intervention patient . Patients enrol study receive additional compute tomography ( CT ) scan involve ionise radiation . These scan exclude certain cause haemorrhage ( aneurysm ) would preclude safely administer RT therapy . Diagnosis aneurysm would however substantial benefit patient determine clinical management . Volume STEALTH CT scan obtain prior surgery 24-48 hour post-operatively aid navigate RT catheter measure degree clot evacuation . To guide number pass RT catheter on-table CT scan may necessary intra-operatively . In total , additional radiation dosage equate approximately 4 milliSieverts ( mSv ) , equivalent approximately 1.5 year background radiation . Set potential benefit RT excessive . Patients suitable RT fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion , , condition , able give inform consent . The nature pathology study mean trial novel treatment first conduct patient able give consent . The investigator approach family , relative , friend discuss patient ' express wish towards participate research proceed enrolment consultees agreement . Objectives - To determine feasibility efficacy rheolytic thrombectomy evacuate intraventricular haemorrhage , measure compute tomography-based volumetric analysis - To assess safety use RT adult intraventricular haemorrhage Study Design Summary Design Single centre prospective cohort study 20 patient IVH treat RT Study Centres This single-centre study conduct : Addenbrooke 's Hospital Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Hills Road Cambridge CB2 0QQ Sample Size Number Participants 20 patient Sample Size Determination From investigator previous experience sample size sufficient pilot study evaluate feasibility safety RT IVH . Study Duration Recruitment expect take 24 month . Endpoints Primary Endpoint Clearance intraventricular blood measure compute tomography Secondary Endpoints - Presence ependymal cell and/or neural tissue cell within effluent collect operation - 14-day survival - Modified Rankin Score 6 month - Duration External Ventricular Drainage - Permanent CSF diversion ( i.e . shunt ) - Intra- post-operative rebleeding - Culture-proven infection ( meningitis/ventriculitis ) Study Participants Overall Description Participants Adult patient admit coma severe intraventricular haemorrhage require external ventricular drainage Patient Withdrawal Patients nominate consultee free withdraw study time . Patients withdraw study follow baseline CT angiography aneurysm demonstrate think possibly cause IVH . Patients withdraw study prior RT replace achieve ensure full assessment feasibility safety make . Given study involve one-time intervention envisage patient withdrawn follow-up RT , unless request nominated consultee .
