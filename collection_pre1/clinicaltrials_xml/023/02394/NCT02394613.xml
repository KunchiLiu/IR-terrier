	<brief_summary>Glaucoma major cause irreversible blindness worldwide , cause retinal nerve cell ( RGC ) death . This currently identify significant vision loss already occur early event , potential marker , process RGC `` apoptosis '' ( form cell death ) . This study aim investigate tolerability safety ANX776 , part new Detection Apoptosing Retinal Cells ( DARC ) technique . This developed laboratory DARC IP holder grant applicant : Prof. M. Francesca Cordeiro . A secondary aim initially establish ability DARC identify RGC apoptosis diagnosis glaucoma healthy progressive glaucoma/glaucoma-suspect/ocular hypertensive patient . As positive control secondary aim study , patient Non-arteritic Anterior Ischaemic Optic Neuropathy ( NAION ) recruit . During study , patient undergo several ophthalmological examination , image back eye use establish clinical device , blood sample study safety toxicology profile ANX776 . The understanding safety profile ANX776 crucial use DARC patient , application potentially powerful new clinical tool identify patient early glaucoma vision lose . If successful , open door directly observe effect glaucoma treatment , include assessment new , breakthrough therapy .</brief_summary>
