Additionally , cost treatment substantial consider prolonged ED visit conservative treatment often follow time expense EBP . The goal investigation aid confirmation case report advocate economy , efficacy safety synthetic ACTH treatment PDPH ( 4,5,6,7,8,9 ) . After patient receive sign inform consent form ( ICF ) Patients randomly assign undergo either : ( 1 ) EBP IVF therapy ( 2 ) Cosyntropin IV IVF therapy . Endpoints pain score give prior procedure , ED discharge pain score post procedural day ( PPD ) day 1 , day 3 day 7 pain functional level . Patients Cosyntropin arm study may request crossover EBP anytime 24 hour assessment period complete per Standard Care treatment PDPH , order ensure undue distress place patient order complete study . Investigational New Drug ( IND ) Exemption use Cosyntropin . Research Objective : To develop efficacious cost effective alternative Epidural Blood Patch Caffeine therapy Postdural Puncture Headache . Two Study Groups : ( 1 ) Group A - Cosyntropin 500 mcg 1000 mili-liters Normal Saline ( NS ) run 1 hour ( 2 ) Group B - Epidural Blood Patch 1000 mili-liters NS - 1liter NS run 1 hour wait call team place Epidural Blood Patch - Std Epidural Kit use 18g tuohy needle Loss Resistance ( LOR ) provider prefer medium - Max 20 cc sterile blood epidural space amount dictate either 20cc sig pain/pressure - Pt supine 30 minute post procedure Randomization Procedures : Computer generate random number list even number receive Cosyntropin odd number receive traditional epidural blood patch . Methods Materials : After referral Anesthesiologist confirmation PDPH diagnosis , patient randomize either Cosyntropin Epidural Blood Patch assure negative pregnancy . If enrol Cosyntropin arm bag premixed ( pharmacy ) Cosyntropin 500mcg 1 liter Normal Saline bag Intravenous Fluid run 1 hour . Please see detail . Additionally , telephone follow-up questionnaire perform person directly involve study collect data describe . Standard Care : Patients evaluate ED , clinic , labor deck pre-op area PDPH suspect patient offer give conservative treatment intravenous caffeine . If treatment fail and/or patient request , Anesthesia team notify possible EBP . Experimental Procedure : Randomly select patient receive Cosyntropin 500mcg IV 1 liter NS v EBP Research Material Collected : Verbal Analogue Scale score improvement functional status . Pt 's identified Patient ID number patient 's hospital Identification ( ID ) Social Security Number ( SSN ) . Contact information keep separate patient track sheet ( see attach ) keep electronically password protect computer . Subject Recruiting : All patient meet inclusion requirement offer enrollment time diagnosis/treatment . Justification Subject Population : Patient 's PDPH often significant pain level subsequent decrease function . Recent literature note decrease efficacy invasive Epidural Blood Patches . Alternate , less invasive technique , could decrease time relief allow treatment patient contra-indications Epidural Blood Patch . Risks : Local Infection , meningitis , allergic reaction , spinal hematoma , nerve damage , paralysis , failure procedure , new dural puncture . Incidence adverse event track . 1 . Justification Risks- Control arm current standard care patient population . Experimental group utilize medication low risk profile . This medication often use ICU set critical ill without increase risk . 2 . Minimization Risks- Control arm current standard care . Experimental group treat monitored setting either Emergency Department , Post- Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) L &amp; D PACU 3 . Medical Monitor- A medical Monitor appoint Benefits : Optimization pain control patient PDPH . Will provide alternative method treat patient PDPH contra-indications EBP . Will significantly reduce cost/personnel treatment PDPH give option medical provider remote region care without training/equipment perform EBP . Statistical Analysis : Data analysis accomplish use descriptive inferential statistic . Demographic data analyze use Student 's t-test . Frequency data compare Chi-square test . A student 's t-test use compare verbal pain score . The satisfaction score compare Mann-Whitney U test . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider significant . All analysis perform utilizing Intention-to-Treat analysis clearly state result section number person switch cosyntropin group epidural blood patch therapy . The efficacy EBP study group `` crossover '' group also note .</detailed_description>
