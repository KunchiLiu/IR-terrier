	<brief_summary>Currently , cardiac compute tomography angiography ( CCTA ) well-implemented non-invasive diagnostic imaging modality patient stable chest pain . Besides conventional CT-reading , CCTA also capable identify several morphologic geometric characteristic atherosclerotic plaque . Recently , investigator show use semi-automated plaque quantification algorithm identify parameter predictive acute coronary syndrome top clinical risk profile conventional CT-reading . In addition , several atherotrombosis biomarkers , like high-sensitivity cardiac troponins , describe related coronary artery disease cardiovascular event . Prospective data sequential analysis atherosclerotic plaque combine different atherothrombosis biomarkers currently lack , provide important clue pathophysiology plaque progression atherothrombosis .</brief_summary>
