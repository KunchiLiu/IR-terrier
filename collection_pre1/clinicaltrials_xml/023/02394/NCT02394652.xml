	<brief_summary>Cervical cancer remain important health problem worldwide . Poor tumor oxygenation ( hypoxia ) associate inferior survival cervical cancer resistance radiation treatment . Hypoxia-modifying therapy improve survival , exist therapy impractical and/or toxic . Metformin , non-toxic drug diabetes , show decrease tumor hypoxia animal study use associate well survival diabetic cancer patient . It hypothesize metformin may decrease cervical tumor hypoxia thereby improve tumor response radiation survival patient locally advanced cervix cancer . This randomized , multicenter phase II study standard chemoradiation combination metformin versus standard chemoradiation alone woman locally advanced cervix cancer . Women randomize metformin group take metformin start 1 week prior standard chemoradiation throughout duration external radiation treatment . Tumor hypoxia measure special X-ray test call positron emission test ( PET ) perform hypoxia dye call FAZA . The main purpose study see metformin decrease tumor hypoxia measure FAZA-PET ; information response side effect also collect .</brief_summary>
