	<criteria>1 . Patient &gt; 18 year age . 2 . Patient legally authorize representative understands research nature study willing capable providing inform consent 3 . Patient appropriate femoral vein access 4 . Patient risk PE meet least one follow set condition : a. Documented DVT PE : . Inability anticoagulate patient due risk bleed recent surgery , trauma , intracranial bleed , GI bleed , OR ii . Progression/recurrence DVT PE therapeutic anticoagulation , OR iii . Inability anticoagulate due high risk tumor bleeding , OR iv . Patient unable safely comply anticoagulation , OR v. Patient need interruption therapeutic anticoagulation time operation procedure . b . Patient high risk DVT PE safely anticoagulated severe multitrauma patient patient procedure high risk thromboembolism bariatric surgery . c. Patients DVT high risk PE free float iliac caval thrombosis d. Patients compromise cardiopulmonary reserve exist PE right heart failure/strain could tolerate insult new PE 1 . Patient one follow condition : 1 . Thrombus iliac vein IVC preclude access appropriate placement Crux Filter 2 . Known inadequate venous anatomy allow insertion retrieval filter IVC 3 . Known duplicate leftsided IVC 4 . Known IVC transverse diameter target lower renal ostia &gt; 28mm &lt; 17mm 5 . Known extrinsic compression abdominal pelvic mass 6 . Known tumor thrombus involve central venous system 7 . Uncontrolled sepsis , infection persistent bacteremia 8 . Patient risk septic pulmonary embolism 9 . Patient exist implanted filter IVC superior vena cava ( SVC ) underwent filter retrieval previous 60 day . 10 . Patient uncontrollable active coagulopathy know uncorrectable bleed diathesis 11 . Patient condition inhibits radiographic visualization IVC postdeployment assessment 2 . Patient know allergy intolerance polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) Nitinol ( nickeltitanium ) 3 . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol 4 . Patients history know reaction sensitivity contrast agent premedicated 5 . Female patient childbearing potential pregnant ( must negative pregnancy test within 48 hour prior implantation retrieval procedure ) 6 . Patient participate another device drug clinical trial participate trial 30 day prior enrollment 7 . Investigator considers patient poor candidate study believe patient may compromise study , e.g. , concomitant condition ( reason document )</criteria>
