	<detailed_description>Research optical imaging lead development Full Field Optical Coherence Tomography ( FFOCT ) technology , allow image fresh tissue depth hundred micron . The system microscope couple interferometer . A halogen light source use illuminate tissue specimen reference mirror . The light retro diffuse specimen combine light reflect mirror , interference signal measure . Multiple Grey scale image obtain automatically stitch obtain complete slide throughout specimen . The feasibility technique report various pilot study , well absence potential tissue harm subsequent pathological artifact cause process . FFOCT could use additional detection tool prostate cancer screening . The use extend systematic trans-rectal ultrasound-guided ( TRUS ) prostate biopsy lead over-diagnosis over-treatment . Also , number unnecessary biopsy increase , along morbidity procedure . Performing `` pre-pathological '' evaluation biopsy core biopsy procedure would significant help determine nature target area guide number biopsy perform . We hypothesize FFOCT image prostate biopsy core would allow cancer detection rate statistically different pathological analysis .</detailed_description>
