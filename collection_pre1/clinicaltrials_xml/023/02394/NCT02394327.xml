	<brief_summary>Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy current standard therapy acute cholecystitis , temporary decompression gallbladder ( GB ) percutaneous endoscopic route require alleviate inflammatory process reach appropriate time elective surgery patient high operative risk mark local inflammation organ dysfunction . Also preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) often needed common bile duct ( CBD ) stone accompany patient acute cholecystitis report rate 7-20 % . Two-steps approach percutaneous transhepatic GB drainage ( PTGBD ) follow ERCP vice versa perform treatment acute cholecystitis concomitant CBD stone suitable urgent cholecystectomy . However single-step drainage CBD GB ERCP endoscopic transpapillary GB drainage ( ETGD ) use nasocystic tube plastic stent alternatively attempt patient contraindication PTGBD . In clinical practice , many endoscopists hesitate perform ETGD relatively low technical success rate specific concern post-ERCP adverse event minimizes catheter keep duration , provide effective clinical improvement via physiologic route . Currently scarce data ETGD use nasocystic tube plastic stent comparable term clinical efficacy safety .</brief_summary>
