	<brief_title>A 24-week , Multicenter , proSpective stUdy Evaluate PASI 90 Clinical Response Rate Safety PRofile sEcukinuMab 300 mg Cw6-negativE Cw6-positive Patients With Moderate Severe Chronic Plaque-type Psoriasis ( SUPREME )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biological agent represent advanced type treatment psoriasis . Secukinumab human monoclonal anti IL-17A antibody bind human IL-17A neutralizes bioactivity inhibit IL17A produce Th17 cell innate immune system , thus provide complete anti IL17A blockage . Targeting IL-17A potential reduce autoimmune inflammation leave immune function undisturbed . While target Th1-promoting Th17-promoting cytokine affect critical mediator IFN-γ , IL-22 IL-21 , selective target IL-17A leaf Th1/17 activity , well certain protective function innate cell intact . Furthermore , fully human monoclonal antibody , secukinumab reduce immunogenic risk compare current emerge antibody therapy fully human . Many recent study show highly selective biologic drug effective every patient variation genome associate different clinical response side effect give drug . The PSORS1 locus chromosome 6p generally understood confer risk psoriasis . A specific allele locus , HLA C*06 , present 60 % psoriatic patient case . Data link secukinumab efficacy particular genetic marker lacking . Recent research reveal mark difference proportion PASI 90 achiever 12 week Cw6-positive Cw6-negative patient ( 85.7 % vs 56.5 % ) treat ustekinumab ( Talamonti M et al . 2013 ) great efficacy anti-TNFα drug CW6 negative patient ( Galli et al . 2013 ) .Unlike anti-IL-12/23 agent , secukinumab inhibits IL-17 produce Th17 cell presentation antigen present cell ( case Cw6 ) cell innate immune system whose activation require antigen presentation . Providing drug equally effective Cw6-negative Cw6-positive patient would important clinical accomplishment would eliminate need costly HLA-Cw6 test . The choice cohort study would therefore seem appropriate clinical context . The purpose study explore different efficacy safety profile secukinumab 300 mg patient moderate severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis , stratify presence HLA-C*06 , whose determination blind patient investigator . The study conduct anti-TNFα-naïve anti-TNFα failure patient also stratify TNFα - 308 polymorphism , BMI , smoke metabolic syndrome , among others .</detailed_description>
