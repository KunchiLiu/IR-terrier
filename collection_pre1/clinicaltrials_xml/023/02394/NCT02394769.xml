	<brief_title>ASPirin Intervention REDuction Colorectal Cancer Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study , investigate use aspirin potential chemopreventive agent reduce risk colorectal cancer . Within gastroenterology practice Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) , conduct prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial measure effect daily low-dose ( 81 mg/day ) standard-dose ( 325 mg/day ) aspirin urine , plasma , stool , tissue biomarkers associate colorectal cancer . Aspirin part non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) family , drug routinely use pain-killing ( analgesic ) , fever-reducing ( antipyretic ) , anti-inflammatory property . Most NSAIDs available over-the-counter formulation . Substantial evidence conclusively demonstrate aspirin reduces risk colorectal neoplasia , yet remain uncertainty surround mode action . Aspirin already establish reduce risk cardiovascular disease . Prospective study well randomized clinical trial demonstrate aspirin reduces risk precancerous polyp colorectal cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Underwent screen surveillance colonoscopy MGH within last 9 month removal least one adenoma . Age 1880 year . This study include adult participant colorectal carcinogenesis child likely related cancer predisposition syndrome distinct biological mechanism compare sporadic colorectal cancer adult . Patients age 80 enrol since benefit risk daily aspirin regimen age 80 yet wellcharacterized . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) Not currently take aspirin ( dose ) within last 6 month . The effect aspirin develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Use nonaspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAID ) dose least three time week two month prior randomization . Diagnosis inflammatory bowel disease , liver kidney disease , bleed diathesis Any prior diagnosis gastrointestinal cancer ( include esophageal , small intestine , colon , pancreatic ) , diagnosis cancer ( exception non melanoma skin ) active treatment within last three year Participants receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition aspirin . Known diagnosis Familial Adenomatous Polyposis ( FAP ) Hereditary NonPolyposis Colorectal Cancer ( HNPCC , Lynch Syndrome ) . Any adenoma completely remove previous colonoscopy . History aspirin intolerance , bleed diathesis , peptic ulcer gastrointestinal bleed , endoscopic complication , contraindication colonoscopy . Inability unwillingness abstain nonprotocol use aspirin NSAIDs provide blood , urine , stool sample colon biopsy study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant breastfeeding . Pregnant woman exclude study aspirin FDA Category D agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother aspirin , breastfeed discontinue mother treated aspirin . Participant must able swallow pill . Participant take anticoagulant agent ( e.g . warfarin ) antiplatelet agent ( e.g . clopidogrel ) .</criteria>
