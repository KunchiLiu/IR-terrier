	<brief_title>Phase I Trial Of IMRT Using A Contralateral Esophagus Sparing Technique ( CEST ) In Locally Advanced Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational intervention also try define appropriate dose investigational intervention use study . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve radiation chemotherapy treatment option disease . Currently , establish rule avoid esophagitis treatment lung cancer radiation therapy . We develop IMRT-based technique , term CEST , reduce radiation dose part esophagus locate opposite tumor . The reason behind approach low radiation dose cause less esophagus inflammation irritation , therefore , may preserve swallow function esophagus well . In clinical experience , reduce radiation dose part esophagus fashion show potential dramatically decrease likelihood severe esophagitis many though people lung cancer . We therefore wish analyze technique . There firm data indicate different chemotherapy regimen give time radiation therapy result different rate esophagitis . The Investigators , therefore , allow type standard-of-care chemotherapy regimen discretion patient 's medical oncologist .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study . Histologically cytologically proven diagnosis NSCLC SCLC NSCLC , patient clinical stage IIBIV patient ( AJCC , 7th ed . ) eligible , SCLC , limitedstage patient eligible , documented candidate definitive radiation concurrent chemotherapy radiation oncologist medical oncologist clinic note . Stage IV NSCLC patient eligible solitary brain metastasis Patients nonmalignant pleural effusion eligible . If pleural effusion present , follow criterion must meet exclude malignant involvement : When pleural fluid visible CT scan chest xray , pleuracentesis require confirm pleural fluid cytologically negative . Exudative pleural effusion exclude , regardless cytology ; Effusions minimal ( ie , visible chest xray ) small safely tap eligible . Gross tumor ( primary tumor involve lymph node ) must within 1 cm esophagus recent chest CT scan . ECOG performance status 01 within 30 day prior registration ; Age â‰¥18 Women childbearing potential must indicate possibility pregnant time enrollment negative serum pregnancy test prior initiation radiation therapy . Women childbearing potential male participant must practice adequate contraception . Patient must provide studyspecific inform consent prior study entry . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Greater minimal , exudative , cytologically positive pleural effusion Tumor suspect know invade esophagus Prior chemotherapy precludes administration concurrent chemotherapy protocol treatment . Note induction chemotherapy allow long concurrent chemotherapy possible . Prior radiotherapy region study cancer would result overlap radiation therapy field Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) base upon current CDC definition ; note , however , HIV test require entry protocol . The need exclude patient AIDS protocol necessary treatment involve protocol may significantly immunosuppressive . Protocolspecific requirement may also exclude immunocompromised patient . Pregnancy woman childbearing potential men sexually active willing/able use medically acceptable form contraception ; exclusion necessary treatment involve study may significantly teratogenic . Any history allergic reaction chemotherapy use</criteria>
