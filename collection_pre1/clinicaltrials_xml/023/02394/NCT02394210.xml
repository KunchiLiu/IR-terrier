	<brief_title>Post-authorisation Study Biological Relapse Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>National , observational , prospective , post-authorisation multicentre registry . It include patient diagnosis MM receive two line treatment least one partial relapse ( ≥ PR ) late anti-MM treatment , duly document accordance criterion IMW Consensus Panel 1 : 1 . Patients prior relapse/biological progression , even without asymptomatic relapse/biological progression follow every one two month , accord clinical judgment physician investigator , provide analysis ( proteinogram and/or immunofixation ) two month ( +/- 15 day ) prior inclusion document patient situation asymptomatic relapse progression . Patients first second relapse/biological progression initiate treatment currently approve market Spain treatment relapse MM , base criterion International Myeloma Workshop ( IMW ) Consensus Panel 11 patient without treatment relapse/biological progression clinical relapse initiate treatment clinical relapse , accord standard criterion clinical practice , accord clinical decision participate physician study , provide analysis ( proteinogram and/or immunofixation ) two month ( +/- 15 day ) prior inclusion document patient situation relapse asymptomatic progression . Therefore , two group define inclusion registry patient 1st 2nd relapse/biological progression , depend treatment strategy adopt accord routine clinical practice site participate study . Group 1 : Patients relapse/biological progression receive treatment clinical relapse . Relapse/biological progression , criterion IMW ( International Myeloma Workshop ) Consensus Panel 11 , understood asymptomatic relapse ( without CRAB symptom ) define ≥25 % increase low value obtain response , follow : - Serum M-protein ( absolute increase must ≥0.5 g/dL ) and/or - Urine M-component ( absolute increase must ≥200 mg/24 hr . ) and/or - Only patient without measurable disease serum urine , 25 % increase low difference correlate uncorrelated FLC ( absolute increase &gt; 10 mg/dL ) - In patient unmeasurable M-protein serum urine , unmeasurable FLC level , 25 % increase percentage plasma cell bone marrow ( absolute percentage must ≥10 % ) - In patient asymptomatic relapse/biological progression complete response , recurrence M protein serum urine immunofixation electrophoresis two consecutive sample [ 1 ] - Patients group study two phase : - Phase 1 ( observation phase ) : Patients initially receive anti-myeloma ( anti-MM ) treatment , thus patient treat myeloma relapse/biological progression clinical relapse . - Phase 2 ( anti-MM treatment clinical relapse ) : Patients receive conventional anti-myeloma treatment clinical relapse* . Group 2 : ( anti-MM treatment time relapse/biological progression ) : Patients group may receive conventional anti-myeloma treatment per routine clinical practice participate site : 1 . Upon relapse/biological progression , define per criterion IMW ( International Myeloma Workshop ) Consensus Panel Panel1 , asymptomatic relapse ( without CRAB symptom ) , define ≥25 % increase low value obtain remission , follow : - Serum M-protein ( absolute increase must ≥0.5 g/dL ) and/or - Urine M-component ( absolute increase must ≥200 mg/24 hr . ) , and/or - Only patient without measurable disease serum urine , 25 % increase low difference correlate uncorrelated FLC ( absolute increase &gt; 10 mg/dL ) - In patient unmeasurable M-protein serum urine , unmeasurable FLC level , 25 % increase percentage plasma cell bone marrow ( absolute percentage must ≥10 % ) - In patient asymptomatic relapse/biological progression complete response , recurrence M protein serum urine immunofixation electrophoresis two consecutive sample [ 1 ] Or 2 . Upon significant relapse paraprotein , define : - Duplication M-component two consecutive reading take ≤2 month apart ; - An increase absolute level serum M-protein ≥1 g/dL M-protein urine ≥500 mg/24h , - Increase light chain level ≥20 mg/dL abnormal ratio two consecutive reading take ≤2 month apart ) , suggest presence biological progression/relapse criterion , without include clinical detail involve clinical relapse* . - change treatment regimen , example , discontinuation addition drug ( except change dose initial drug ) mark end anti-MM treatment phase pass patient 36-month post-treatment follow-up phase . In case temporary interruption study drug , 30 day , duration ( except reason interruption toxicity , patient continue anti-MM treatment phase , provide treatment regimen resume . Patients include registry prior relapse/biological progression , assign group 1 2 accord strategy investigator decide relapse/biological progression occur . Furthermore , include patient phase prior relapse/biological progression must analysis ( proteinogram and/or immunofixation ) two month ( +/- 15 day ) prior inclusion document patient situation relapse asymptomatic progression . If patient include registry stage prior relapse/biological progression relapse progress directly CRAB criterion consider non-evaluable purpose sample size , although evaluated purpose secondary exploratory objective define section 5.2 . In case , patient receive anti-MM treatment/s recurrence progression accord clinical practice participate site . Likewise , patient include registry receive treatment within clinical trial deem evaluable . From time relapse/biological progression occur , investigator shall period two month decide observation group include patient . Follow-up establish duration anti-MM treatment phase . For patient included registry whenever possible , prospective follow-up period extend additional 36 month ( data collect every 6 month ) , start phase last dose study medication . Once patient include registry , must follow maximum two month interval , relapse progression disease , inclusion data electronic case report form every 2 month ( patient include registry relapse/biological progression ) , every 4 month ( patient include registry prior relapse/biological progression ) , order allow exact calculation TTP ( primary endpoint ) time relapse/biological progression clinical relapse . To end , proteinogram and/or immunofixation ( case negative protein count ) must assess every one two month completion treatment prior inclusion . However , give observational nature study , patient follow-up take place per routine clinical practice site .</detailed_description>
