	<brief_summary>Patients glioblastoma face grim prognosis . Despite recent advancement neurosurgical technology neuro-oncology glioblastoma almost invariably progress recur median 4-8 month . The strategy repeat tumor resection recurrence order minimize tumor load thus facilitate subsequent second-line therapy show feasible safe . However , evidence survival benefit surgery recurrent glioblastoma scarce relies entirely retrospective analysis . While retrospective analysis report apparent survival benefit , EORTC meta-analysis second-line therapy find survival difference patient without surgery recurrence . With regard risk cost inherent surgery glioblastoma , randomize control trial require . The purpose study compare effect craniotomy tumor resection follow adjuvant second-line therapy surgery follow second-line therapy overall survival , neurological status , quality life . Analysis overall survival use improve sample size estimation subsequent phase III trial craniotomy tumor resection glioblastoma recurrence cooperation EORTC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Glioblastoma malignant , locally invasive brain tumor whose prognosis remain grim despite various intense treatment modality . In past , radical surgery meet skepticism due aggressive infiltrative character tumor . However , increase number retrospective study last decade suggest survival benefit surgery . A recent post-hoc analysis randomize control trial use surgical adjunct 5-ALA report prolonged overall survival 11.9 16.7 month ( evidence level 2a ) extensive resection . Thus , maximal safe resection become mainstay treatment newly diagnose glioblastoma , follow adjuvant radio-chemotherapy . Glioblastoma almost invariably recur median 6.9 month , leave option treatment . Recurrence glioblastoma surgery concomitant adjuvant therapy represent additional therapeutic challenge may treat second-line pharmacotherapy . In addition , second surgery may also consider highly select patient . The rationale surgery - maximum safe resection - prolong survival reduction tumor load , , maybe due increase efficacy adjuvant treatment . However , surgery carry risk complication , may result decreased functional survival outcome . The crucial question therefore whether , extent , cost term neurological risk second resection prolongs survival . Objective The primary objective randomize trial compare survival outcome surgery follow adjuvant second-line therapy surgery follow second-line therapy recurrent glioblastoma . An auxiliary objective primary objective compare survival outcomes operated patient control subgroup stratify extent resection : incomplete resection ( non-CRET ) v complete resection ( CRET ) . Secondary objective : assessment recruitment screen patient , comparison progression-free survival treatment arm , evaluation crossover comparison patient quality life treatment arm . Safety objective : assess neurological deficit , local infection morbidity associate surgery hospital stay surgery follow-up . Methods All patient ( ≥18 year ) radiological suspicion first recurrence glioblastoma screen trial . Patients eligible study participation inform treatment option recurrent glioblastoma ( surgery follow adjuvant second-line therapy , second-line therapy , palliative therapy alone ) center investigator . Patients randomize control group receive second-line therapy accord local guideline . Patients randomize interventional group receive craniotomy resection tumor follow adjuvant second-line therapy . Outcome measure 3 month interval . Recruitment rate reason non-inclusion monitor .</detailed_description>
