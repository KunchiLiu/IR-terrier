	<brief_summary>This phase I open-label study evaluate safety ALLO-ASC-DFU diabetic foot ulcer patient . ALLO-ASC-DFU hydrogel sheet contain allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell . Adipose-derived stem cell anti-inflammatory effect release growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) , enhance wound heal regeneration new tissue , finally may provide new option treat diabetic foot ulcer .</brief_summary>
