	<brief_summary>In study , researcher show caregiver patient use tDCS device ( device design easy use , fix parameter one button press run stimulation ) . They ask apply stimulation every day , 5 day per week 4 week , chronic patient minimally conscious state ( MCS ) . 2 session 4 week stimulation realize , one anodal one sham randomize order . Before session , behavioral improvement assess Coma Recovery Scale Revised ( CRS-R ) . A final assessment do 8 week end session assess long term effect tDCS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Repeated tDCS Sessions Cognitive Improvement Patients With Disorders Consciousness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single session tDCS show positive effect patient MCS ( study publish Neurology , 2014 ) . Nevertheless , effect go 1 2 hour . In second study ( Protocol ID : 2009/201/B ) find 5 day tDCS increase last effect one week . To know tDCS could use clinical daily practice , new study evaluate effect 20 minute tDCS leave prefrontal dorsolateral cortex 4 week , 5 day per week , chronic patient MCS . 2 session 4 week stimulation ( total=20 stimulation per session ) perform , one session real ( anodal stimulation ) one placebo ( sham stimulation ) . Firstly , patient see hospital behavioral assessment ( CRS-R ) one his/her caregiver . The investigator explain caregiver perform stimulation . In addition , he/she receive folder video . The caregiver take exam sure he/she performs tDCS properly . Before stimulation session , behavioral improvement assess CRS-R trained neuropsychologist , hospital . A final assessment do 8 week end session ass long term effect tDCS . The compliance record deice sure caregiver performs stimulation every day expect . Researchers expect see ( ) improvement CRS-R total score end anodal session ( b ) improvement persist 8 week .</detailed_description>
