	<detailed_description>Malaria pre-elimination status Mexico ( Rodriguez et al. , 2011 ; WHO , 2012 ) local transmission Plasmodium falciparum interrupt since 2000 , transmission P. vivax , causative agent country , reduce hot spot ( Ministry Health - Mexico , 1995-2005 , Pan American Health Organization ( PAHO ) , 2008 , WHO , 2012 ) . Cloroquine ( CQ ) primaquine ( PQ ) use since 1940 treat P. vivax blood liver infection affect area worldwide ( Coatney , 1963 ) . However P. vivax resistant CQ progressively report various geographic region since late 80´s , ( Baird 1995 ) . Chloroquine , longer recommend mono-therapy WHO , 2010 ) , administer ( 25 mg / Kg . body weight ) three consecutive day ( 10,10 5 mg /Kg body weight ) combination PQ ( 0.25 - 0.75 mg/Kg body weight ) 14 day , still use region parasite susceptible ( White , 1998 ; WHO , 2010 ) . The 14 -day regimen effectively cure primary blood infection prevent relapse least 90 % patient ( Galappaththy et al. , 2007 ) . In Mexico , CQ combine PQ use standard treatment P. vivax malaria since 50´s past century . However , PQ treatment frequently complete due undesirable side effect stomach upset . In location difficult access , extend interval blood sampling , parasitological diagnosis treatment patient could take long 3-4 week . Hence , reduce risk transmission , febrile patient remote area blood sample immediately treat single dose 10 mg CQ 0.75 mg PQ/kg body weight , , microscopy confirmation , intermittent single dose regimen ( ISD ) administer ( Mendez et al. , 1994 ; Channon et al. , 2003 ; NOM-032-SSA2-2002 ) . The first single combine CQ-PQ still administer expected eliminate blood parasite since PQ may destroy parasite survive effect CQ [ Murphy et al. , 1991 ) , repeat administration ISD intend suppress parasitemia recurrence ( Mendez et al. , 1994 ) . However , effectiveness evaluate . Assessment monitoring effectiveness implement treatment strategy necessary advance towards malaria elimination region ( malERA , 2011 ) . Methodology This study approve Ethical Review Committee National Institute Public Health ( INSP ) , Mexico . Informed consent obtain patient guardians patient 18 year old . The study follow World Health Organization ( WHO ) vivo test protocol monitor antimalarial drug resistance . Since early relapse occur 17 day post-primary blood infection , primary blood infection clearance , patient follow ≈Day 28 one month 12 month monitor relapse elimination . When require , flexible schedule implement facilitate patient ' follow minimize patient lose suggest others ( Ruebush et al. , 2003 ) . Study site . The study carry Tapachula municipality surround community southern Chiapas , Mexico , border Guatemala . Patient recruitment carry diagnosis facility Regional Center Public Health Research-INSP ( CRISP ) Tapachula City , febrile people seek malaria diagnosis treatment , obtain free service . Sample size . A minimum sample size participant per group expect indicate The World Health Organization clinical study Americas ( ( WHO , 2009 ; PAHO , 2010 ) . However , total patient enrol study period , determine number case diagnose P. vivax meet inclusion criterion accept participate . Patient enrollment . A symptomatic patient define person present fever two malaria symptom . Patients recruit February 2008 October 2009 follow inclusion exclusion criterion ( see eligibility criterion ) . Enrolled patient randomize receive either , combine CQ PQ medication ISD T14 scheme , patient live Tapachula City nearby prefer receive T14 facilitate daily treatment supervision . The day diagnosis prior treatment administration ( day 0 ; date annotate ) , patient examine axial temperature celsius degree ( °C ) , body weight ( kg ) , spleen swell presence clinical symptom within previous 48 h fever , headache , myalgia arthralgia . Erythema jaundice sign determine day enrollment . For parasitological molecular analysis , Capillary blood collect finger prick prepare thin thick smear impregnate filter paper ( Whatman # 2 ) , respectively . Other demographic data collect use questionnaire e.g . age , gender , previous chloroquine primaquine intake malaria infection , etc . Patient treatment follow-up . The recommend dose one single dose consist 10 mg/kg CQ phosphate 0.75 mg/kg primaquine . Patients ISD schedule take single dose Days 0 , 30 , 60 , 180 , 210 240 . On hand , optimal dose T14 include 25 mg/kg CQ administer 3-day period ( 10 mg/kg day 0 1 5 mg/kg day 2 ) PQ 0.25mg/kg/day 14 day ( WHO , 2010 ) . However , treatment regimen adjust patient ' age accord operational table prescribe Mexican official guideline ( NOM-032-SSA2-2002 ) . All treatment dos administer supervision member study team . For small child , tablet crush , mixed water spoon fed . Treated patient observe 30 minute ingest drug . Those vomit first dose re-treated similar dose , vomit exclude study . The first part study design monitor parasitological ( primary blood infection clearance ) clinical response treatment schedule . Treated patient schedule examination Days 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 28 . The second part study design monitor occurrence relapse monthly parasitological clinical examination , 12 month . Patients encourage come back facility , necessary contact u cell phone ( patient parent cell phone ) , felt ill time follow-up period question study . Participants unable return facility visit home provide treatment , clinical revision blood sampling . A rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) ( OptiMAL© ) apply symptomatic patient home . The thick smear symptomatic patient negative RDT analyze day case confirm recurrent P. vivax episode , patient immediately treat T14 . When require , flexible schedule implement facilitate patient ' follow e.g . patient first SD regimen home Day 3 visit Day 4 , Days 7 ± 1 , Day 14 ± 2 , patient ( ISD T14 ) Days 21 ± 2 . Two thick thin blood film sample blood impregnated filter paper ( Whatman # 2 ) prepare every schedule extra visit ( symptomatic patient ) . Patients axillary temperature ≥37.5 ◦C symptomatically treat paracetamol ( 10 mg/kg ) . ( see Outcome measure ) Parasitological diagnosis . Thick thin blood film stain 10 % solution Giemsa colorant five min . The thick smear examine light microscope use oil immersion 100 × experienced microscopist . Asexual sexual parasite density determine count number parasite 200 white blood cell ( WBC ) ( 500 WBC , less 10 parasite encounter 200 WBC field ) , assume 7,000 WBC/μl blood ( Gonzalez-Ceron et al. , 2005 ) . Anti-P. vivax blood stage IgG antibody ELISA . To uncover P. vivax recurrent blood infection ; asymptomatic and/or low parasitemia detect microscopy , immunoglobulins isotype G ( IgG ) native P. vivax blood stage protein measure sample obtain month 1 12 . From patient , blood sample preserve filter paper elute phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) test ELISA detect IgG antibody P. vivax blood stage ( Gonzalez-Ceron et al. , 1991 ) . Sero-conversion change antibody titer analyze . A cut value 0.25 absorbance value previously determine . Molecular diagnosis . Molecular diagnosis show sensitive different malaria affect region ( Rubio et al. , 1999 ) . All follow-up blood sample Days 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , ~21 ~28 , sample take 12-month follow suspicion recent malaria infection , suggest increase antibody anti-P. vivax IgG ( ELISA ) , subject molecular diagnosis . Six punch 5 mm dry blood filter paper cut use extract DNA use QIAamp® DNA Blood Mini Kit ( QIAGEN , Germany ) follow manufacturer instruction . The DNA suspend 50 µl water . To detect P. vivax RNA ribosomal 18S subunit gene ( 18ssrRNA ) . Genotyping primary recurrent P. vivax infection ( Gonzalez-Ceron et al. , 2013 ) . To compare P. vivax genotype primary secondary episode , Polymerase chain reaction-restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ) use analyze cspr , msp3α msp3β gene marker . The homogeneity P. vivax genotype among group examine Fisher´s exact test ( α = 0.05 ) . Data analysis All parasitological clinical data patient complete supervised treatment ( 28 day , 12-month ) analyze use STATA v12 . To discard possibility sub-dose caused delay parasite clearance , body weight record day 0 use calculate dos CQ PQ give patient compare necessary body weight . Parasitological clinical cure primary blood infection : Classification treatment outcomes indicate method surveillance antimalarial drug efficacy ( WHO , 2009 ) Early treatment failure ( ETF ) - danger sign severe malaria day 1 , 2 3 presence parasitaemia ; - parasitaemia day 2 high day 0 , irrespective axillary temperature ; - parasitaemia day 3 axillary temperature ≥ 37.5 ºC ; - parasitaemia day 3 ≥ 25 % count day 0 . Late treatment failure ( LTF ) - Danger sign severe malaria presence parasitaemia day day 4 day 28 patient previously meet criterion early treatment failure ; - Presence parasitaemia day day 4 day 28 axillary temperature ≥ 37.5 ºC ( history fever ) patient previously meet criterion early treatment failure . Adequate clinical parasitological response ( ACR ) - Absence parasitemia within day 7-28 without TF signal . For ACR analysis , microscopic parasitological result include without PCR adjustment . Fisher 's exact test use compare two independent proportion : gender , presence symptom , distribution P. vivax genotype , PCR positivity parasite persistence day 2 3 treatment group . The Wilcoxon rank sum test use non-parametric comparison : age , asexual sexual parasitemia , drug dos , day symptom , axial temperature . All test significance two tail P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Recurrent blood infection , detect 12 month follow-up register well patient retire . The effectiveness calculate percent accumulate number patient without P. vivax blood infection ( first recurrent case ) detect month sampling , divide total number patient follow . Z test use determine difference proportion patient sample recurrent infection . To plot cumulative incidence patient first recurrence percent , Kaplan -Meier failure estimate use . To evaluate clinical parasitological outcome primary blood infection , sample obtain day 2 . 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 28 flexible schedule recurrent blood infection continue sample month 12 month . Blood sample Day 2 Day 28 analyze microscopy thick smear molecular diagnosis . Samples patient symptom immediately analyze recurrent infection detect , patient rescue 14-Day treatment . To uncover asymptomatic infection , sample within 1-12 month analyze microscopy test antibody IgG titer suspect recurrent blood infection assay molecular diagnosis . Only data patient complete supervise treatment include analysis . Parasitological clinical cure primary blood infection : The analysis response treatment consider two outcome base 1 ) early clinical parasitological outcome evaluate 2-3 day post-treatment , 2 ) therapeutic failure ( TF ) clinical and/or parasitological asexual parasite persistence reappearance occur within 7-28 day . An adequate clinical parasitological response ( ACPR ) define ( 1 ) absence parasitemia within day 7-28 without TF signal . For ACR analysis , microscopic parasitological result include without PCR adjustment . The effectiveness relapse elimination evidence monthly follow one year detect presence symptom /or parasite blood stream P. vivax genotype match primary recurrent infection . Classification treatment outcomes recurrent blood infection detect beyond 28 day 12 month : Recurrent blood infection . The recurrence symptomatic asymptomatic asexual parasitaemia , treatment administration , produce relapse episode new infection . A relapse cause hypnozoite , dormant stage liver present proportion patient primary blood infection . The gender , age patient recurrent blood infection indicate , well timing , parasitemia , serological change , parasite genotype , presence absence symptom . The proportion recurrent episodes match genotype compare treatment regimens statistical significance calculate ( p value ) . SUPERVISION , FORMATS AND PROCEDURES TO AVOID MISSING DATA : Patient registry : document patient name , village ( home number/ address ) unique code . The PI regularly supervise procedure diagnosis patient recruitment follow lab field set .
