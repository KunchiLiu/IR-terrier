	<brief_summary>The primary goal proposal study outcome patient recurrent Clostridium Difficile Infection ( CDI ) treat frozen Fecal Microbiota Transplantation ( FMT ) open-labelled controlled trial . The specific objective evaluate safety FMT determine clinical response , treatment failure relapse rate patient treat frozen-and-thawed FMT ; assess functional health well-being patient arm use validated tool , determine feasibility provide standardized FMT multiple centre across Canada , include community hospital . The metagenomics also conduct stool sample collect select patient arm : pre post treatment match donor . The metagenomics data use determine bacteria may contribute cure CDI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CDI frequent cause healthcare-associated infectious diarrhea industrialized country affect 300,000 patient year United States . The incidence CDI nearly triple 1996 2005 ( 31 84 per 100,000 patient-days ) United States . The rise incidence accompany increase disease severity , mortality 6.9 % case . According Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program study conduct November 1 , 2004 April 30 , 2005 , incidence rate health care-associated CDI adult patient admit Canadian hospital 65 per 100,000 patient-days . The study identify overall attributable mortality patient CDI 16.3 % 5.7 % , respectively Canada , similar US data.1,17 The associated economic burden also significant . Nosocomial CDI increase cost otherwise matched hospitalization four-fold , translate great $ 1 billion/year ( United States ) . Since implementation mandatory report CDI case September 2008 Ontario , 13 health-care facility declare CDI outbreak Ontario . There number death directly due CDI outbreak . The management outbreak costly . The direct attributable cost associate outbreak management alone per episode per institution exceed $ 1 million ( direct communication hospital chief financial officer ) . There grow concern regard failure standard antimicrobial therapy . The treatment failure rate metronidazole , ﬁrst line therapy uncomplicated CDI , rise 2.5 % great 18 % since 2000 . Recurrence rate high among elderly , exceed 50 % age 65.20 Recurrence rate exceed 60 % patient fail 3 episode standard antimicrobial therapy . The vanB gene , responsible confer vancomycin resistance Enterococcus isolate clostridia , potentially threaten future use vancomycin CDI . Given high failure recurrence rate use standard therapy , principal investigator ( PI ) research proposal offer FMT patient experience CDI longer 6 month despite multiple course metronidazole oral vancomycin therapy . She begin treat patient recurrent CDI FMT follow reason . First , patient respond antibiotic treatment . Second , patient may experience intolerance metronidazole due metallic taste , significant nausea loss appetite , lead weight loss patient CDI experience considerable weight loss . Also , patient develop irreversible peripheral neuropathy ( nerve damage ) long term use metronidazole . Third , patient refractory CDI could afford continue oral vancomycin . The cost oral vancomycin prohibitive routinely reimburse public health plan . A 14-day course oral vancomycin cost $ 600 number patient antibiotic 6 - 18 month cost $ 7,200 $ 21,600 ( personal communication St. Joseph 's Healthcare Outpatient pharmacist ) . The cost one FMT approximately $ 100 , include laboratory screen test nurse 's administration time .</detailed_description>
