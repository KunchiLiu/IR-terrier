Each subject study approximately 6 week . Each subject participate one treatment cohort , reside Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) Day -1 ( day dose ) Day 6 ( 120 hour post-dose ) . Each cohort dose lead edge design two subject receive study drug ( 1 active 1 placebo ) first dose day , last 6 receive study drug ( 5 active 1 placebo ) second dosing day . All subject return post-study visit 8 10 day dose study medication . Cohorts dose 2 weekly interval . There review safety data , first two subject dose dose subsequent six subject . There complete review safety pharmacokinetic data cohort prior dose escalation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Ascending Oral Dose Study F901318</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Male healthy subject conform selection criterion invite take part study . Screening visit ( Visit 1 ) After give fully inform , write consent , subject attend clinic . Subjects undergo screen within 28 day prior first dose administration . Prior screen visit , subject : - Refrain vigorous exercise 7 day - Abstain alcohol 48 hour - Subjects sign consent form presence CRU physician prior screen procedure perform . The information record subject , regardless suitability study , retain archive The follow information procedure record performed part screen assessment : - Medical history - Ethnic origin , sex , age , height , weight , BMI - Vital sign : supine blood pressure , supine pulse rate , oral body temperature - Resting 12 lead ECG - Physical examination - Urine drug abuse screen , cotinine breath alcohol - Fasting clinical laboratory serology investigation Up 28 day screen , subject attend clinic . Subjects admit research unit approximately 13:00 hour afternoon day dose ( Day -1 ; -19 hour pre-dose ) . Urine subject screen drug abuse breath test alcohol cotinine . Detection substances disqualify subject study . A physical examination , check inclusion/exclusion criterion , clinical laboratory evaluation , oral temperature body weight perform . Subjects ask whether experienced adverse event take concomitant medication since previous visit . Supper serve start 19.30 hour snack 21.00 hour , follow subject fast . Water allow ad libitum throughout . On day 1 , total first urine void morning subject collect polyethylene container , , sample take urinalysis pre-dose / baseline F901318 concentration . Within one hour dosing commences ( -1 hour ) , blood drawn laboratory safety assessment ( haematology clinical chemistry ) , pre-dose baseline F901318 metabolites concentration . Supine stand blood pressure pulse rate triplicate , body temperature 12-lead ECG record . The subject also connect continuous ECG record -1 hour 12 hour start dose . Subjects ask whether experienced adverse event overnight . Any concomitant medication record . Option 1 : Subjects dose . This oral ingestion liquid formulation follow 250 mL water . Subjects dose regular ( least 5 minute ) interval subject . After initial dosing , follow measurement observation obtain : • Blood sample analysis F901318 plasma concentration drawn 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 , 90 , 120 minute , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 72 , 96 120 hour follow dosing . Pharmacokinetic blood sample analyse review dose escalation . After first dose administration , time blood sample may necessary adjust within 120-hour period subsequent dose escalation . The basis decision depend upon pharmacokinetic profile obtain precede group subject . All change document file note . The number sample volume blood drawn must increase without prior approval relevant ethic committee . Option 2 : If appear pharmacokinetic measurement oral absorption extremely rapid , leading high Cmax relatively low AUC0-12 , dose may split half , second half give 4-8 hour first . Under circumstance , blood sampling schedule would decide prior dosing would exceed 26 sample 120 hour period . For Both Options : - Blood sample analysis metabolites draw 4 8 hour initial dose . - Blood collect safety measurement ( haematology clinical chemistry ) 24 , 48 72 hour post initial dosing . - Complete urine collection analysis F901318 urine concentration make follow interval relation dosing : 0-4 , 4-8 , 8-12 , 12-16 , 16-24 , 24-48 , 48-72 , 72-96 96-120 hour initial dose . - Supine stand pulse rate blood pressure ; body temperature ( vital sign ) record 30 , 60 120 minute , 4 , 8 , 24 , 48 72 hour initial dose . - Twelve-lead ECGs obtain 1 , 4 , 24 , 48 72 hour initial dose . - The continuous ECG record cease 12 hour initial dose . - Spontaneously report adverse event note throughout . - A urine sample take urinalysis 24 , 48 hour 72 hour initial dose . - Lunch serve approximately 4 hour initial dose 4 hour observation blood sample complete main meal serve approximately 8 hour snack approximately 12 hour dose . Subjects may leave Research Unit Day 6 , unless experienced adverse event , opinion Investigator , warrant observation and/or treatment . All subject follow 8-10 day dose post-study visit .</detailed_description>
