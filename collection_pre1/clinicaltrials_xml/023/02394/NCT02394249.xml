	<brief_summary>Background study : A sedentary lifestyle obesity well know risk factor type 2 diabetes . The major focus current guideline type 2 diabetes prevention energy balance . Physical activity guideline recommend least 30 minutes/day moderate vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) . However , advice give 23.5 hour day spend . Several recent epidemiologic study suggest excessive sitting , independent moderate vigorous physical activity , detrimental health effect . Another possibility sit less increase low intensity physical activity slowly walk stand . A recent publish study Duvivier colleague suggest sit less replace slowly walk stand well effect insulin action cardiovascular risk factor combination one hour MVPA per day sit rest day healthy subject ( Duvivier et al . PLOS ONE 2013 ) . Until research perform subject overweight/obesity . Objective study : To assess effect low intensity physical activity plasma insulin level , cognition mood subject overweight/obesity Study population : 21 subject 40-80 year old overweight/obesity Intervention : 2 activity regime 4 day : sitting regime `` sit less '' regime</brief_summary>
