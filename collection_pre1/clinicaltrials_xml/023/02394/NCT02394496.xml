	<detailed_description>In presence ER hypersensitivity even small amount ER may sufficient sustained growth signal . On hand , ER disruption operate fulvestrant complete , particularly initial phase treatment . From phase III trial , indeed , The invertigators know standard 250mg monthly dose steady state circulate drug reach 5-6 injection . This may play role since , long ER downregulation concern , clear dose-response relationship report . In situation , fulvestrant efficacy may partial , particularly concomitant AI discharge yield restoration physiologic postmenopausal level circulate oestrogen . New dose schedule currently investigation accelerate achievement steady state ( load dose ) achieve high circulate drug level ( high dose ) ( 86 ) . In trial investigator use so-called 'loading dose ' . Further potential strategy improve fulvestrant efficacy setting : A ) avoid restoration circulate oestrogen ; B ) interfere molecular mechanism produce ER hypersensitivity target EGFR/ERBB2/ERB3 system . A ) avoid restoration circulate oestrogen : achieve hold AI treatment . Because case progression upon AIs may relate inefficient inhibition aromatase logical step test whether change AI class ( type I , steroidal , type II , non steroidal , vice-versa ) ( 87 ) , may improve fulvestrant efficay . In view , pts trial randomize receive fulvestrant ( load dose ) without alternate class AI treatment . Circulating oestrogens level track verify inhibition aromatase pt assign concurrent AI treatment . B ) Interfere growth factors-mediated ER hypersensitivity : although fulvestrant able overcome ER hypersensitivity LTED ( 88 ) produce growth arrest , activity may complete incomplete ER disruption , also direct stimulation growth hyperactivated EGFR/ERBB2/ERB3 system . Laboratory evidence support hypothesis . Indeed , breast cancer cell line expose long-term treatment fulvestrant become insensitive drug restore growth ( 89 ) . This growth appear , however , related development direct resistance drug , since ER mediate signal continue efficiently suppress cell ; rather may drive use alternative growth-stimulating pathway , include EGFR system . Indeed , abrogate EGFR-tyrosine Kinase inhibitor Gefitinib ( IRESSAâ„¢ ) MAPK-inhibitor ( 90 ) . Lapatinib ( GW572016 ) orally active small molecule reversibly inhibit ErbB1 ErbB2 tyrosine kinase , turn block phosphorylation activation Erk1/2 ( p-Erk1/2 ) Akt ( p-Akt ) ErbB1- and/ ErbB2-expressing tumor cell line xenograft ( 91-94 ) . Lapatinib elicit cytostatic cytotoxic antitumor effect depend cell type ( 95 ; 96 ) . Because ErbB2-containing heterodimers exert potent mitogenic signal , simultaneously interrupt ErbB1 ErbB2 signal appeal therapeutic approach . Moreover , ErbB3 signal also involve lapatinib action . Indeed ErbB3 kinase-dead relies ErbB2 transactivation : ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimers potent activator PI3K-Akt survival pathway ( 97 ; 98 ) , , turn , inhibit lapatinib . Based molecular mechanism action , fair toxicity profile promising , although preliminary , activity data , Lapatinib appear ideal candidate combine Fulvestrant attempt improve efficacy patient progress AIs .</detailed_description>
