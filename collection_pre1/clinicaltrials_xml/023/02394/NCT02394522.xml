	<detailed_description>The primary epidemiological endpoint incidence density first time malaria infection among human cohort follow-up period detect polymerase chain reaction assay ( PCR ) . This measure inform PE ( reduction incidence ) intervention control study arm use formula : PE = [ ( Ip - Ia ) /Ip ] * 100 % ; base expect minimum effect size 30 % . First time infection subject offer relatively unambiguous evidence extent exposure infectious mosquito bite . The primary entomological endpoint adult density vector specie via human-landing catch ( HLC ) sentinel household intervention control arm follow-up period . Secondary epidemiological endpoint incidence density first time malaria infection among human cohort follow-up period detect microscopy total number case avert ( i.e. , Plasmodium spp . infection cohort subject ) . Secondary entomological endpoint include number sporozoite infected mosquito , parity species-specific effect spatial repellent product . Both epidemiological entomological endpoint utilized look relationship SR PE base product coverage ( include diversion community effect ) insect behavior . The prospect SR associate temporal cumulative effect study endpoint ( epidemiological entomological ) transmission season also investigate use cumulative incidence infection season apply survival curve analysis cohort data .</detailed_description>
