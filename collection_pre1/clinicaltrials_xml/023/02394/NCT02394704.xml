	<detailed_description>Intrusive negative cognition key transdiagnostic feature many psychiatric disorder , difficult treat , predict poor outcome conventional neurobehavioral intervention . Here , evaluate extent novel intervention capitalize preserve neurocircuitry attend evolutionarily salient somatosensory stimulus use train attentional mechanism override otherwise pre-potent negative cognition . The initial period involve open-label intervention refinement mechanistic evaluation mechanism ; N=35 individual high level intrusive negative cognition dysphoria assess pre/post intervention grade sensory training condition . Success suggest new intervention pathway traditionally treatment-resistant dimension psychopathology . The second phase randomize trial 70 participant equally allocate graded non-graded training condition .</detailed_description>
