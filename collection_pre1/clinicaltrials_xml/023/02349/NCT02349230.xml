	<brief_summary>Subjects randomize 3 treatment group ( 15 subject per group ) : 1 ) Control - receive treatment 2 ) Placebo - receive sham Astym速 treatment 3 ) Astym速 Treatment - receive Astym速 treatment low extremity . Subjects blind whether receive Astym速 treatment placebo treatment intervention . After 5-minute warm-up low body ergometer subject familiarize operation computerize leg press machine measure maximum force output ( Newtons ) unilateral isometric squat test . A baseline measure maximal force output ( pre-test ) determine average 3 trial 30 second rest period trial . The subject receive designated treatment intervention . Immediately follow treatment intervention ( 0 minute follow treatment intervention ) subject retested ( post-test ) use identical testing procedure investigator blind treatment intervention receive subject . Maximum force output measure Newtons post-test subtract maximum force output ( Newtons ) pre-test converted percentage change [ ( post-test - pretest ) /pretest X 100 ) . The percent change maximal force output pre-test post-test measure compare use one-way analysis variance alpha set 0.05 . A Tukey 's post-hoc analysis determine statistical difference group .</brief_summary>
