	<brief_summary>Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ) serious birth complication due systemic asphyxia occur 20 1,000 full-term infant nearly 60 % premature newborns . Between 10-60 % baby exhibit HIE die newborn period 25 % HIE survivor permanent neurodevelopmental handicap form cerebral palsy , mental retardation , learn disability , epilepsy . HIE also significant financial impact health care system . In state Florida , total cost initial hospitalization $ 161,000 per HIE patient admit , cost n't take account life-long cost . Current monitoring evaluation HIE , outcome prediction , efficacy hypothermia treatment rely combination neurological exam , ultrasound , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) . However , method poor job identify non-responders hypothermia . MRI require transport neonate requisite 40-45 min scan , appropriate unstable neonate . Moreover , amplitude integrated EEG ( aEEG ) , common bedside monitor technique currently use patient assess candidate predict outcomes prior hypothermia , adversely affected hypothermia patient may appear improve re-warming . Consequently , development simple , inexpensive , non-invasive , rapid biochemical test essential identify candidate therapeutic hypothermia , distinguish responder non-responders assess outcome . This research first step need treat neonate HIE employ personalize medical approach use serum protein GFAP UCH-L1 biomarkers monitor neonate response therapeutic hypothermia . These biomarkers aid direct care provide rapid test predict outcome select candidate likely benefit therapeutic hypothermia gauge response neuroprotective intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Control Neonates easily obtain single center , Shands UF . The control sample derive two group : ( 1 ) `` Healthy Controls '' healthy neonate Apgar score ≥ 7 1 minute ≥ 8 5 minute medical problem associate neurologic injury hyperbilirubinemia hypoglycemia . This group establish negative control 500-800µL blood collect time standard blood metabolic screen ( 24 48 hour life ) . ( 2 ) `` Clinical Controls '' healthy neonate evaluate jaundice , multiple blood sample draw birth 48 hour life monitor serum bilirubin concentration . They additional 0.8-1 mL blood drawn time clinical sample ( venous heel stick ) perform . In addition , neonate exclude show sign sepsis hypoglycemia ( &lt; 40 ) . The neonate ' bilirubin plot use American Academy Pediatrics risk-based stratification method , Bhutani monogram ( base serum bilirubin concentration hour life ) . Clinical control neonates must low-risk low-intermediate bilirubin concentration , virtually risk brain injury .</detailed_description>
