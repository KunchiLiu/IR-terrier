	<brief_title>Phase 2 Trial Evaluate Early Bactericidal Activity , Safety Tolerability Meropenem Plus Amoxycillin/CA Faropenem Plus Amoxycillin/CA Adult Patients With Newly Diagnosed Pulmonary Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single-centre , open-label clinical trial include total 45 male female participant ( 2 group 15 participant receive IMP 1 group 15 participant receive Rifafour e-275 ) , age 18 65 year ( inclusive ) , newly diagnose , smear-positive , pulmonary tuberculosis enrol trial . Treatment administer 14 consecutive day follow dose scheme : 1 . Meropenem 2g intravenously 8-hourly ; plus amoxycillin/CA 500mg/125mg orally 8- hourly day 1-14 . 2 . Faropenem 600mg orally 8-hourly ; plus amoxycillin/CA 500mg/125mg orally 8-hourly day 1-14 . 3 . The third arm receive standard first line TB treatment per South African TB guideline ( Rifafour e-275 ) include control EBA quantitative mycobacteriology evaluate whether HRZE give similar EBA result demonstrate prior study combination . The mycobacteriology laboratory remain blinded closure EBA result . Participants admit hospital facility period 24 day . During period await screen result receive 14 day IMP . day 14 intensive PK sample do . They discharge day 15 clinic continue national TB programme treatment regime . Participants return clinical trial site 14 day receipt last study drug . safety evaluation .</detailed_description>
