	<brief_title>Immune Modulation Parenteral Fish Oil Patients With Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Fish oil ( FO ) , rich omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid , exerts range anti-inflammatory action render potential therapeutic agent treat Crohn 's disease , chronic inflammatory disease primarily affect bowel . Recent evidence suggest lack effect previous study might due fact genetic background take account . For instance , study healthy subject show production pro-inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) follow FO supplementation decrease individual within high tertile pre-supplementational TNF-α production , remain unaltered middle tertile , increase low tertile pre-supplementational TNF-α production . TNF-α play pivotal role pathogenesis Crohn 's disease , hence treatment anti-TNF-α agent . Based notion , FO supplementation via enteral route strongly dose limited due fat-induced side effect diarrhea , hypothesize parenteral FO supplementation might beneficial patient Crohn 's disease high inherent TNF-α production . Study design : Single center , randomize , single blind , lipid-controlled , cross-over pilot trial . Study population : Adult patient Crohn 's disease previous bowel surgery , currently remission ( without need immunosuppressive drug ) high inherent TNF-α production . Intervention : First , patient high inherent TNF-α identify assessment TNF-α production group 100 patient meet in- exclusion criterion . Patients within high tertile classify high producer . Next , 5 patient within high tertile randomize receive intravenous administration 20 % ( w/v ) lipid-control ( Intralipid® ) , , cross , 10 % ( w/v ) fish oil emulsion ( Omegaven® ) , vice-versa 1 hour three consecutive day dose 0.2 g/kg bodyweight /hr . Study parameter assess blood drawn prior first infusion ( T=0 ) 1 ( T=4 ) 8 day ( T=11 ) third infusion . Between two treatment arm , wash-out interval least 2-3 week . Main study parameters/endpoints : Early ( T=day 4 ) late ( T=day 11 ) effect infusion TNF-α production whole blood culture . Secondary outcome : effect leukocyte count , leukocyte function ( anti- ) oxidant status , occurrence oxidative damage analysis specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ( SNPs ) relate TNF-α production .</detailed_description>
