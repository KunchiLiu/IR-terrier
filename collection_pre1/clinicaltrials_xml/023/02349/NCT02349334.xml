	<brief_summary>Faecal incontinence occur person pass faeces ( stool ) without usual control . It distress condition actually common although under-reported embarrassment . Milder symptom may manage treatment dietary change , drug bowel retrain , many patient still resort surgery improve symptom . Although several operation exist treat incontinence e.g . aim repair damage anal sphincter muscle , clear often poor result . Two relatively new treatment call sacral nerve stimulation ( SNS ) percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation ( PTNS ) involve send pulse electricity nerve control bowel muscle anus ( anal sphincter ) . SNS insert electrode low back tailbone connecting implanted electrical stimulator bury buttock act bite like heart pacemaker . SNS relatively well-established treatment specialist centre , use 10 year . It show study successful faecal incontinence achieve improvement least three quarter patient . In Europe , procedure fast become first treatment offer non-surgical treatment fail . Nevertheless , SNS miracle cure , require 2 operation , potential complication expensive equipment ( &gt; £10,000 approx ) . PTNS newer treatment , involve electrically stimulating nerve ankle , use small needle , outpatient ( bit like acupuncture ) . This send signal back spine region try improve symptom faecal incontinence . Since new treatment , few study perform quantify successful , early result PTNS suggest may good SNS . If true , important much less invasive considerably cheap SNS ( equipment £500 per patient ) . This project first time determine effective PTNS treatment patient faecal incontinence , compare sham ( fake stimulation ) . This study properly design clinical trial 212 patient least 14 UK Specialist Centres.. The result trial lead direct benefit patient NHS .</brief_summary>
