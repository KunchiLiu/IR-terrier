	<brief_title>Safety Feasibility MR-Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( MR-HIFU ) Ablation Osteoid Osteoma Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoid Osteoma ( OO ) benign , painful , bone tumor commonly occur child young adult . Common treatment option surgical excision , recently , CT-guided radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) . RFA less invasive , still require drill skin muscle soft tissue bone . It also expose patient operator ionize radiation . Magnetic Resonance guide High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( MR-HIFU ) provide precise control delivery focus ultrasound energy inside lesion use external applicator , without need scalpel needle . MR-HIFU successfully use treat painful bone metastasis adult clinical trial one recent report suggest also use treat OO . MR-HIFU ablation OO may provide good alternative surgical resection RFA completely non-invasive require ionizing radiation . These two quality MR-HIFU especially beneficial grow child young adult . Furthermore , MR-HIFU OO ablation quick , expect total procedure time le two hour . Such short treatment offer additional safety benefit reduce anesthesia / sedation requirement compare surgery RFA</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis : All patient clinical suspicion OO base presence typical symptom localize nocturnal pain relieve NSAIDs unrelated trauma activity . Typical imaging finding CT and/or MRI . Plain radiographs bone scan may obtain refer physician helpful confirm clinical diagnosis substitute CT MRI . Noncontrast enhance contrast enhance CT study acceptable . Contrast enhance MRI study perform . Tissue biopsy require Tumor location : Target lesion locate peripheral bone acoustic accessibility . Target lesion may intracortical juxtacortical location . Target lesion must reachable within normal safety margin HIFU specify instruction use . Prior therapy : ●Patients prior unsuccessful surgical resection RFA eligible enrollment . Laboratory : Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Platelet count ≥75,000/µL ( may receive transfusion ) Normal PT , PTT INR &lt; 1.5 x ULN ( include patient prophylactic anticoagulation ) Renal function : Ageadjusted normal serum creatinine ( table protocol ) OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 safe contrast administration Adequate pulmonary function : Defined dyspnea rest , pulse oximetry &gt; 94 % room air clinical indication determination . Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness , serious infection , hepatic , renal organ dysfunction , judgment Principal Associate Investigator would compromise patient 's ability tolerate general anesthetic require procedure . Implant prosthesis scar tissue within path HIFU beam . Target &lt; 1 cm nerve plexus , spinal canal , bladder , bowel Target &lt; 1 cm growth plate ( physis ) Lesion skull vertebral body Inability undergo MRI and/or contraindication MRI Inability tolerate stationary position HIFU Patients currently receive investigational agent .</criteria>
