	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 study design purpose estimate various parameter surround efficacy Clofarabine , Cyclophosphamide Etoposide eliminate minimal residual disease ( MRD ) acute leukemia patient otherwise remission without cause significant delay HCT due treatment related toxicity . A single course `` bridge '' chemotherapy give prior transplant procedure approach improve disease-free survival patient group historically inferior outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bridging Study Eliminate Presence MRD Acute Leukemia Before HCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study entry open patient regardless gender ethnic background . The intent study design patient receive complete one course therapy . Patients exhibit sign disease progression experience unacceptable toxicity discontinue treatment . There dose delay dose reduction study drug hematologic toxicity Consolidation `` Bridging '' therapy ( Day 1 Day 30 ) ; however , prolong hematopoietic recovery bone marrow aplasia first 42 day may meet study stop rule .</detailed_description>
