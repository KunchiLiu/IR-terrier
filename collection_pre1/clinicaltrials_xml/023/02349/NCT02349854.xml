	<brief_summary>Seborrheic dermatitis common , inflammatory skin condition cause flaky , white yellowish scale form oily area scalp inside ear . These scale occur without underlie redden skin . In addition cause psychological distress , low self esteem , embarrassment , seborrheic dermatitis associate scalp pruritus ( itch ) . Treatment modality exist control scalp flake itch associate seborrheic dermatitis , although therapy often lose efficacy time . As seborrheic dermatitis chronic ( life-long ) condition , good treatment need . The investigator propose good characterize subject seborrheic dermatitis involve scalp versus normal scalp control : ( ) clinical characteristic associate itch ( b ) pattern nerve innervation scalp . In way , investigator hope get comprehensive understanding factor cause scalp itch aim information create new candidate treatment modality design . At least 12 ( 20 ) subject similar number control subject without disease one clinic visit include questionnaire , test sensation scalp , biopsy scalp .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Seborrheic dermatitis ( SD ) common skin disorder mainly affect scalp , cause scale , itch , red skin . Dandruff , subset SD , show scale itch absence associate red skin . Seborrheic dermatitis occur many different body area , include scalp , eyebrows , eyelid , crease nose , lip , behind ear , outer ear , middle chest . On scalp , SD commonly associate pruritus ( itch ) . Multifactorial theory propose regard pathogenesis SD , include irritation skin-based yeast call malessizia , overproduction sebum sebaceous gland affect skin area , individual variability . Specifically , malassezia produce free fatty acid sebaceous gland-produced triglyceride , free fatty acid `` irritant '' ( ie , non-immunologic ) effect patient `` susceptible predisposition . '' Other factor associate flare SD include stress , fatigue , weather extreme , infrequent shampoo skin cleaning , use lotion contain alcohol , skin disorder ( acne ) , obesity , neurologic condition ( include Parkinson 's disease , stroke , head injury ) , HIV infection . What role , , factor play etiology scalp pruritus patient SD know . Furthermore , itch signal specific subset nerve skin whether pruritus SD result alteration nerve underlie inflammatory state unknown . Moreover , pruritus skin result peripheral sensitization , skin-derived signal activate nerve skin send increase nerve signal central nervous system . Pruritus sense skin also result alter central-nervous system process skin-derived nerve signal , skin-derived touch pain misperceive itch central nervous system . Whether itch patient SD result peripheral and/or central sensitization also unknown . Understanding distinction therapeutic implication , itch result misprocessing central nervous system adequately treat , short term , skin-administered topical therapy . To good understand etiology scalp pruritus subject SD , determine clinical characteristic scalp pruritus subject SD compare normal control , well determine relationship scalp pruritus change cutaneous innervation . METHODS : This exploratory pilot study single plan visit outpatient Dermatology clinic Shapiro center . Subjects carry diagnosis seborrheic dermatitis scalp itch , control n't , ( either internally refer routine visit outpatient Dermatology clinic BMC externally refer outside provider respond recruitment technique ) undergo initial phone screen review inclusion exclusion criterion . This screen involve anonymous screen question without collection personal health information . Subjects/controls meet criterion eligible study ask willing come BMC single study visit . Those subjects/controls agree schedule next told seek informed consent phone follow minimal risk procedure preparation study visit : 1. place unique patient code identifier screen form 2. willing stop use topical scalp treatment seborrheic dermatitis/dandruff well ( c ) stop prn elective use prescribe over-the counter antihistamine least 3 week schedule visit . ( ) willing wash hair least 48 hour prior visit . The consent process include highlight individual stop `` washout '' anytime . Those subjects/controls , undergo informed consent process read phone , agree ( ) ( b ) ( c ) , schedule one hour visit outpatient Dermatology floor non-clinic time . At visit , subjects/controls first undergo following : 1 . Visual non-invasive inspection scalp 2 . Completion patient visual analogue scale ( VAS ) score measure degree scalp pruritus past week . This VAS form identifiable health information . 3. Review inclusion/exclusion criterion answer provide phone , inform consent phone time give answer , agree allow u store unique subject/control identify code . The 3 minimal risk procedure ( one patient already provide informed consent ) , happen `` study visit screening '' ( describe detail Screening Section 20.0 ) second informed consent process perform . This order respect patient 's time . If long meet inclusion/exclusion criterion base minimal risk screening , eligible study would unnecessarily undergo additional screening well informed consent process . After obtain write informed consent participate study , follow occur : 1 . Female subject child-bearing potential take urine pregnancy test . 2 . Subjects/controls fill-out questionnaire pruritus questionnaire contain additional targeted question related scalp itch hair care practice 3 . Investigators assess scalp identify involve , pruritic site along EEG lead axis T3-O1 , secondarily , along EEG lead axis C3 Pz . EEG test standard non-invasive neurologic test scalp electrode place well-defined specified position scalp . We EEG use electrode . We simply use anatomic landmark specify EEG placement allow uniform selection scalp area test biopsy . 4 . Digital photograph patient 's head , focus scalp take . 5 . At select scalp site , investigator perform follow test central sensitization , select scalp site ( see method test ) : - Warm heat ( method section explain procedure ) ass felt itch use 3 mm diameter metal probe - Alloknesis ( brush itch : possible scalp hair ) - Hyperknesis ( enhanced sensation itch pinprick ) - Duration itch elicit insertion cowhage spicule scalp ( possible scalp hair ) . This procedure describe detail . 6 . The investigator perform single scalp biopsy procedure site central sensitization testing , accord standard care practice . The 2mm specimen place formalin routine paraffin-embedding . The 3mm specimen place special fixative optimizes immunohistochemistry frozen section detect antigen express nerve . These specimen label subjects/control 's unique identifying code without personal health information . This one visit complete subjects/control 's entire participation study . No additional visit schedule ( unless individual opt suture option removal suture BMC ) subject/control provide contact information investigator rare event subject/control require care complication biopsy procedure , bleeding , persistent pain , infection , and/or failure heal . In biopsy , density distribution different subset cutaneous nerve fiber determine immunohistochemistry frozen-fixed tissue presence absence histopathologic feature seborrheic dermatitis evaluate paraffin-embedded tissue . Left tissue either frozen and/or paraffin-embedded tissue save repository individual consent , storage tissue safeguard describe detail tissue banking section BMC approve IRB protocol . Estimated Duration Enrollment ( long take recruit require sample size ) : One year . Estimated Duration Entire Study ( estimate duration initial IRB approval data analysis close study ) : Two year Sample Size- Total=60 patient scalp itch seborrheic dermatitis =30 - consent and/or fully participate study = 20 - expect drop out withdrawal termination = 5 - screen enrol = 5 patient without scalp itch without seborrheic dermatitis =30 - consent and/or fully participate study = 20 - expect drop out withdrawal termination = 5 - screen enrol = 5 Sample Size Justification : Although propose study exploratory intent require formal power statement , nonetheless estimate power primary outcome central sensitization patient seborrheic dermatitis versus control plan sample size 20 subject . The expected average mean score patient central sensitization 3 10 control patient 1 10 standard deviation 1 . Therefore , difference group , would expect group mean score 1 standard deviation 1 . In case , truly difference control experimental group ( ie , central sensitization ) , 36 total patient ( 18 per group ) require 80 % sure , 40 total patient ( 20 per group ) require 85 % sure , 44 total patient ( 22 per group ) require 90 % sure , 90 % two-sided confidence interval exclude difference mean 1 . We feel instance , certainty 80 % clinically meaningful opt 40 instead 36 good ensure date achieves least 80 % certainty . For total number per cohort , number patient contact u undergo anonymous screen question without collection personal health information . This number difficult predict , patient meet eligibility criterion base answer anonymous screen question , include either cohort risk , personal health information collect . Data Analysis : The propose study design one one three specific aim describe , one dependent variable ( outcome ) 1 independent variable ( 2 independent population : subject seborrheic dermatitis scalp itch control without scalp itch seborrheic dermatitis ) . For non-normal data , intend use non-parametric test , Mann Whitney Wilcoxon rank sum test ass statistical difference median population . In addition , use non-parametric analysis , Spearman correlation correlate result skin test result immunohistochemical count nerve . If fact distributional assumption meet allow parameteric analysis , use 2 independent sample t-test assess statistical difference mean .</detailed_description>
