	<brief_title>Antiviral Prophylaxis Burn Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , randomized trial antiviral prophylaxis risk individual yet perform . We anticipate disease burden population burn patient large , especially patient exhibit high risk characteristic , hypothesize antiviral prophylaxis significantly reduce incidence Herpes Simplex Virus burn population . This study profound impact treatment burn patient institution throughout country . Prophylactic treatment use Acyclovir burn patient would decrease patient morbidity , pain suffering would likely positively impact scarring , wound healing , , ultimately , patient satisfaction quality life . Reducing incidence HSV infection decrease length hospital stay many patient , save health care expense resource . If prophylactic Acyclovir become standard care treatment burn patient , treatment plan would tremendous public health breakthrough prevent HSV outbreak could extrapolate research similar protocol health condition .</detailed_description>
