	<brief_title>The Cost Effectiveness Endoscopic Ultrasound ( EUS ) Based Strategy Diagnosis Common Bile Duct Stones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Multiple report show efficacy EUS comparable ERCP diagnosis CBD stone . The EUS-based strategy provide cost save diagnosis CBD stone patient intermediate risk previous study western population . There multiple parameter involve cost effectiveness analysis include cost ERCP , cost EUS , prevalence CBD stone , sensitivity specificity EUS rate complication relate EUS ERCP . These parameter may vary center center region region . Aims : To assess cost effectiveness EUS base strategy versus ERCP base strategy diagnosis CBD stone patient intermediate risk develop country . Method : A prospective study 141 patient suspected CBD stone base clinical , biochemical image trans-abdominal ultrasonography compute abdominal tomography . All patient underwent EUS . All patient high risk CBD stone underwent ERCP EUS . For patient intermediate risk CBD stone , ERCP 's do discretion attend physician . For patient ERCP do , diagnosis CBD stone confirm ERCP demonstration CBD stone . In patient intermediate risk without ERCP do , clinical follow ass biliary symptom liver function test surrogated marker CBD stone 3 month interval one year do . The false negative rate patient EUS ERCP do study use estimate false negative rate patient clinical surrogated group . Definition : High risk CBD stone define CBD stone detect US/CT dilate duct abnormal liver function test ( LFT ) . Intermediate risk CBD stone define US/CT show normal bile duct abnormal LFT dilate duct normal LFT . Cost analysis : The cost making diagnosis CBD stone exclude cost treatment analyze . The cost patient suspect CBD stone undergo ERCP calculate compare strategy EUS follow ERCP . The cost evaluate ( 1 ) mean cost EUS ERCP base actual cost center include cost medical staff , disposable material , drug , equipment amortization maintenance . ( 2 ) cost associate complication induced procedure . Statistical analysis : Test performance endoscopic ultrasound diagnosis CBD stone analyze two two table . The sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value calculate .</detailed_description>
