	<brief_summary>This study prospective , single arm , non-randomized , interventional study evaluate safety effectiveness Omental transposition ( OT ) subject early stage AD . Within-subjects ( repeated-measures ) design utilized compare follow-up outcome baseline . The following assessment perform baseline , 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month follow surgery : - Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) - Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition ( ADAS-Cog ) - General Practitioner Assessment Cognition ( GPCOG ) - Eight-item Informant Interview Differentiate Aging Dementia ( AD8 ) Subjects early stage AD confirm neuropsychological test ( MoCA ) healthy enough undergo surgery . The experimental procedure perform omental transposition ( OT ) surgery . It perform laparoscopic open procedure omental lengthening open procedure brain access , general surgeon perform omental lengthening/tunneling neurosurgeon perform brain access/brain biopsy/omental placement brain . Up twenty-five ( 25 ) subject , first 5 subject part learn curve group next 20 subject part experimental group . The duration subject 's participation approximately 25 month screen 24 month follow-up visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The experimental procedure perform omental transposition surgery , general surgeon neurosurgeon work team transpose pedicle omental graft surface brain . The general surgeon responsible perform laparotomy/laparoscopy , elongate omentum long pedicle develop extensive subcutaneous tunnel chest neck head . The neurosurgeon responsible perform craniotomy secure omentum brain . Creating intact omental pedicled flap require service general surgeon neurosurgeon . The first step operation obtain access abdominal cavity laparoscopically use four 5cm trocars , via laparotomy upper midline incision . The omentum remove transverse colon , separate proximal central attachment stomach . The omentum detachment make directly great curvature stomach , leave gastroepiploic artery vein within still-connected omentum apron . Final separation omentum proximal portion stomach do dividing leave gastroepiploic vessel , high proximal level stomach become short gastric vessel . The vascular connection omentum maintain solely right gastric right gastroepiploic vessel . In order omental pedicle graft reach brain without tension , surgical tailoring omentum carry , care take ensure preservation major omental artery vein . After omentum lengthen appropriate extent reach head , several small ( 3- 4-inch ) transverse incision make chest wall slightly lateral midline , side midline make transverse incision depend cerebral hemisphere omentum place . These transverse incision connect subcutaneously , thus create tunnel begin upper pole midline abdominal incision travel subcutaneously , chest wall neck behind ear . Although subcutaneous tissue behind ear extremely dense , essential tunnel location least 2-3 finger length width constriction omentum particular area within tunnel . As omentum tunnel pass behind ear , go beneath base scalp flap previously dissect make initial craniotomy incision . The neurosurgery portion operation involve removal single piece bone temporal-frontal area , open dura mater , follow removal patch arachnoid membrane , care take avoid blood vessel surface brain . At point operation , omentum lay directly upon parietal-temporal-frontal area , dura mater suture omentum . It necessary edge omentum apply cut edge dura since omentum tuck edge dura great coverage brain . The edge dura sewn top surface omentum use absorbable suture craniotomy close .</detailed_description>
