	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect use remifentanil cardiopulmonary bypass surgery supress hyperglycemic response perioperative period . Half participant receive continuous intravenous remifentanil surgery , half receive intermittent intravenous fentanyl surgery . Intermittent intravenous fentanyl administration institution 's standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stress-induced hyperglycemia well-known phenomenon occur cardiopulmonary bypass surgery . Hyperglycemia increase incidence major adverse event mortality patient undergoing cardiac surgery . Remifentanil , ultra-short act opioid analgesic , show reduce stress response cardiopulmonary bypass compare intermittent fentanyl inhalation anesthesia . This turn , reduce occurence perioperative hyperglycemia , glycemic variability insulin requirement patient undergoing cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
