	<brief_summary>CONDITION : Idiopathic male infertility In men idiopathic infertility , sperm DNA fragmentation index ( DFI ) within 12 week FSH therapy 12 week follow-up improves depend FSHR genotype assess non-synonymous SNP rs6166 ( wild type p.N680S ) . This phase II b , multicenter , prospective , open label , one arm , clinical trial stratify accord patient 's genotype . INTERVENTION : FSH therapy ( 150 I.U . sc every day 12 week ) infertile men homozygous wild-type FSHR p.N680S allele FSHR . Duration intervention per patient : 12 week Primary efficacy endpoint : Sperm DFI . Number patient improvement DFI &gt; 60 % Key secondary endpoint ( ) : pregnancy , semen parameter , serum level inhibin B AMH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Male factor infertility responsible 50 % case involuntary couple infertility remain idiopathic half case . At present , consistently effective treatment male idiopathic infertility . Since follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) fundamental spermatogenesis , recombinant hFSH empirically use male infertility treatment . The response FSH , however , highly variable sperm parameter improve patient , 50 % subject clearly respond FSH . Several study perform past recent Cochrane meta-analysis show FSH treatment male idiopathic infertility overall significantly improve pregnancy rate . Nevertheless , predictive marker response FSH , allow stratify therapeutic approach , identify far . The sperm DNA fragmentation index ( DFI ) provide estimation genetic integrity spermatozoon show improve significantly FSH treatment . Therefore , DFI could use pharmacodynamic marker FSH male . In woman , response FSH vary depend FSH receptor ( FSHR ) genotype , determine non-synonymous SNP rs6166 , exchange amino acid Asn Ser codon 680 . This SNP common , minor allele frequency 0.4 . Women homozygous Ser amino acid position 680 FSHR less sensitive endogenous exogenous FSH compare homozygous Asn require FSH multiple follicular growth maturation assist reproduction . The investigator hypothesize variable response FSH unselected infertile men due different individual sensitivity FSH determine common FSHR polymorphism rs6166 . In particular investigator test hypothesis men homozygous Asn 680 ( wild type ) respond well exogenous FSH treatment term sperm DFI compare men homozygous Ser , assess sperm DFI pharmacodynamic parameter FSH . Men idiopathic infertility normal serum FSH level , candidate treatment FSH , recruit . Men sperm DFI &gt; 15 % include trial carrier homozygous Asn/Asn Ser/Ser aminoacid position 680 . The FSHR genotype assess centrally physician receive information whether patient eligible enter trial ( i.e . homozygous ) physician patient remain blind genotype . Human recombinant FSH ( Gonal-f , Merck Serono ) self-administered sc dose 150 IU every day 12 week , follow 12 week observation ( follow ) . Changes sperm DFI primary end point compare two arm . In addition , effect pregnancy rate clinical hormonal parameter evaluate . Should pilot , proof-of-principle trial demonstrate response FSH male idiopathic infertility depend FSHR genotype , large interventional trial aim assess effect pregnancy rate justify .</detailed_description>
