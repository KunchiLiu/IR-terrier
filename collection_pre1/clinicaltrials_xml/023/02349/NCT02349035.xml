	<brief_title>Application Targeted Reinnervation People With Transradial Amputation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1 : Transradial amputee ask come Rehabilitation Institute Chicago , Walter Reed National Military Medical Center San Antonio Military Medical Center initial fit prosthetist multifunctional hand system multifunctional hand wrist system . The prosthesis system consist custom-made socket commercially available component . The first visit ( five day ) involve cast , create fit socket use study . During initial subsequent visit , subject ask asked practice various control method use virtual reality system . EMG data virtual `` game '' use practice control provide quantitative data use assess various control method mathematically , without prosthesis . Once receive socket , complete 1-3 day train learn control prosthesis either conventional pattern recognition control . The prosthetic training day may occur concurrently fit appointment may require separate visit . The subject return home initial 8 week home use trial . They ask use prosthesis average 2 hour per day across 8 week home trial period . They keep home log prosthesis use check weekly therapist discus usage prosthesis performance . They may also provide laptop computer camera Skyping . The laptop connect prosthesis , screen view remotely . The research team continue remote follow training problem solve need . Directly follow 8 week home trial period , usage data prosthesis download . The subject complete 1-3 day outcomes test therapist . A series test perform data record performance . The subject repeat 1-3 day training , 8 week home trial period , 1-3 day outcomes test either type control ( i.e . conventional pattern recognition ) . Phase 2 : The subject return one three center Targeted Muscle Reinnervation ( TMR ) surgery . The surgery outpatient procedure perform general anesthesia , consistent current standard care . The surgery involve transfer median nerve flexor digitorum superficialis ( DFS ) muscle ulnar nerve transfer flexor carpus ulnaris ( FCU ) muscle . Both transfer do single incision . Alternative target muscle ( e.g . brachioradialis muscle ) use trauma interferes use DFS and/or FCU . Some post-operative pain expect subject give prescription pain medication need . Two week surgery subject ask start exercise help muscle recovery . They return use prosthesis Phase 1 either conventional pattern recognition control 6 month surgery . Socket adjustment make need . If return use pattern recognition control , usage performance data track 6 month period . The subject may provide laptop computer ask perform series virtual test . They receive additional training complete test . If subject return use conventional control , ask complete additional test , usage performance data track . Six month surgery , reinnervation target muscle complete , subject return use prosthesis pattern recognition control . They ask return one three center socket adjustment replacement socket need . The subject receive 1-3 day pattern recognition control training , time special attention pay utilizing EMG target muscle improve function . Preliminary test do ensure adequately use prosthesis . The subject take prosthesis home third 8-week home-use trial . The subject ask log daily use device , note issue , follow weekly therapist . After home-use trial , 1-3 day comprehensive outcome test complete usage data prosthesis download . Finally , subject continue use prosthesis home additional 3-4 month . No usage requirement give time . At end 3-4 month period ( approximately 12 month surgery ) , final round 1-3 day test complete toolbox data prosthesis download . The day prosthesis train testing may take place Rehabilitation Institute Chicago , Walter Reed National Military Medical Center , San Antonio Military Medical Center near home . Study coordinator determine best location .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A upper limb amputation transradial level Significant new injury would prevent use prosthesis : The ability consistently wear prosthesis perform activity daily live specific performance task necessary evaluate relative benefit intervention . Cognitive impairment sufficient adversely affect understand compliance study requirement , ability communicate experience , ability give inform consent : The ability understand comply requirement study essential order study generate useable , reliable data . The ability obtain relevant user feedback questionnaire informal discussion add significant value study . Significant co morbidity : Any medical issue injury would preclude completion study , use prosthesis , would otherwise prevent acquisition useable data researcher</criteria>
