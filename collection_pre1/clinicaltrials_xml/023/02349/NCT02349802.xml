	<brief_title>Autoinjector Device Assessment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I multi-cohort study employ flexible study design accommodate multiple cohort . Healthy male female subject &gt; or= 18 year significant health issue include . Each cohort employ open-label , single-arm , repeat-dose design . Injection failure rate continually assess . Injection pain also assess .</detailed_description>
