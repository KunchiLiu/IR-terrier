	<detailed_description>PSC , definition , metastatic stage malignancy . Ovarian cancer , clinically identical entity ( fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer ) commonly find spread PSC . These disease seldom spread outside peritoneal cavity even multiple recurrence . Therefore , clinical experience IPHC nearly ovarian ( relate ) cancer . Ovarian cancer lead cause death gynecologic malignancy United States . There approximately 26,000 new case 14,500 death annually . Primary peritoneal fallopian tube carcinomas significantly less frequent ovarian cancer , outcomes treatment identical . The recommended initial treatment disease perform stag operation aggressive debulking tumor . These patient receive intravenous , intraperitoneal , taxane platinum-based chemotherapy treat residual disease . This treatment yield overall median survival approximately 37 month patient suboptimally debulked ( residual tumor , &gt; 1.0 cm diameter ) 49 month optimally debulked disease ( residual tumor , 1.0 cm diameter ) . Overall , approximately 75 % Stage II-IV ovarian cancer respond initial adjuvant chemotherapy 50 % clinically without evidence disease completion adjuvant chemotherapy cycle . However , 50 % patient would persistent disease identified time second look laparotomy . Of negative second look laparotomy , 50 % experience recurrence disease . Second Look Laparotomy controversial choice patient evidence disease non-invasive mean primary treatment . It appear patient may benefit Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) complete cytoreduction residual disease possible , randomized trial exists prove 5 year survival benefit . Patients recur initial adjuvant chemotherapy generally die disease , salvage therapy effective . At present time , initial adjuvant regimen consist platinum paclitaxel-based regimen standard therapy patient . Cisplatin originally use intravenous regimen continue use intraperitoneal ( IP ) therapy . In fact , GOG make IP cisplatin part standard adjuvant regimen optimally debulked ovarian cancer patient . This shift base analysis three randomize trial support IP cisplatin route . Patients Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) trial underwent optimal cytoreductive surgery randomly assign control group receive intravenous paclitaxel intravenous cisplatin experimental group receive intravenous paclitaxel day 1 , intraperitoneal cisplatin day 2 , intraperitoneal paclitaxel day 8 . At median follow-up 50 month , statistically significant prolongation median progression-free survival overall survival intraperitoneal treatment group ( benefit 5.5 15.9 month , respectively ) . This represent 25 percent reduction risk death . This 15.9-month improvement median overall survival one long survival benefit ever observe new therapy gynecologic oncology . Uterine disease may divide cancer cervix , cancer corpus , behave quite differently , even compare similar histology subtype . Corpus epithelial cancer common Gynecologic malignancy , 41,200 projected 2006 case result estimated 3,750 death . This far prevalent ovarian-related cancer , usually quite curable early stage . Approximately 10-15 % case , however , find outside uterus ( Stage III IV ) presentation . These case poor outcome , 30 % Stage III patient ( disease spread regional lymph node , peritioneal fluid , pelvis ) less 5 % Stage IV ( spread abdominal cavity ) survive 5 year . Recurrent disease occur approximately 29 % Stage I patient Patients recurrence ultimately die disease , often treat medically survival 13-15 month . However , recent retrospective study show patient recurrent disease reasonably offer surgery , good outcome complete cytoreduction . Median survival time range 35 43.0 month , small residual tumor , compare 10-13.5 month patient gross residual disease . Sarcomas uterus rare , represent 2-5 % corpus cancer . These stag treat much like high-grade epithelial cancer , patient poorer survival compare similar stage common histologic subtypes . Early stage patient survive five year less 50 % time . Those advanced disease 0-20 % five-year survival ( median survival 4-26 month ) . Studies diseases subject low number , due rarity disease , conclusion draw . However , surgical debulking thought probably beneficial . Cervical cancer expect account 9,710 case 3,700 death 2006 . The disease often discover early stage , confine cervix ( Stage I ) often curable . Cure rate patient directly related cervical disease volume , survival range 71-90 % . However , 14.4-25.6 % patient early disease recur initial radiation surgical therapy , within 3 year . Recurrent disease usually pelvis , treatable fairly successfully surgical exenteration . Extrapelvic spread disease confine peritoneal cavity 8 % case , treatment patient currently consider futile . OBJECTIVES To determine Overall Survival surgical debulking intra-operative Intraperitoneal Hyperthermic Chemotherapy ( IPHC ) patient follow malignancy : Gynecologic cancer ( ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube , uterine/cervical cancer ) . Mesotheliomas . GI cancer ( Gallbladder , liver , small intestine , pancreas , stomach , colon , appendix ) . To determine number Grade III Grade IV CTCAE v4.03 toxicity complication treatment regimen . To measure treatment relate QOL change IPHC .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PATIENT ELIGIBILITY Presumptive clinical diagnosis peritoneal surface cancer ( PSC ) prior surgery , metastasis outside abdomen . Patients must performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . Patients must adequate : Bone marrow function : absolute neutrophil count equal 1500 platelet count equal 100,000 Renal function : creatinine le equal 1.5 mg/dl Hepatic function : bilirubin le equal 1.5times upper limit normal , SGOT alkaline phosphatase less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal range Patients must sign informed consent . Patients childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test prior study entry practice effective form contraception . Patients least 18 year age , 75 year age . At time surgery , operative assessment frozen section diagnosis one following : Primary ovarian cancer ( POC ) Stage IC great stage Recurrent persistent ovarian cancer ( ROC ) Ovarian cancer patient desire Consolidation Chemotherapy ( CC ) . These patient would ordinarily choose 12 cycle Taxol give standard firstline surgery chemotherapy , instead choose one course IPHC CC . Uterine malignancy corpus , cervix primary tumor Stage IIIA great , recurrent tumor confine abdomen . Metastatic mesothelioma sarcoma confine abdomen . Recurrent primary gastrointestinal cancer , regional spread confine peritoneal cavity PATIENT INELIGIBILITY Patients know extraabdominal disease , unresected bulky abdominal retroperitoneal lymph node . Patients evidence another malignancy within last five year ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer ) Patients known sensitivity cisplatin , Mitomycin C , Adriamycin . Patients significant comorbid medical condition would prevent patient complete treatment protocol , per Investigator discretion . Patients desire future fertility .</criteria>
