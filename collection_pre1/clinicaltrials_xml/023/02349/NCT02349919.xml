	<brief_title>Effect Oral Procaterol Postinfectious Persistent Cough</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persistent cough follow upper respiratory tract infection ( URTI ) common problem clinical practice , namely post-infectious cough . The potential mechanism viral-induced airway epithelial damage lead 1 ) airway hyperresponsiveness airway narrow , 2 ) increase vascular permeability result airway edema , 3 ) activation inflammatory mediator inflammatory cell result airway smooth muscle contraction . It usually spontaneously resolve , although various therapeutic trial use unpredictable result . Regarding bronchodilator , inhale ipratropium effective reduce cough symptom small study ( N=14 ) . We conduct double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial investigate effectiveness oral procaterol , bronchodilator , non-asthmatic adult patient suffer persistent cough post URTI . Eligible patient cough lasting long 3 week post URTI normal spirometry randomize receive either placebo procaterol ( 25 microgram twice daily ) 4 week . The primary outcome cough symptom score use Leicester cough questionnaire ( LCQ ) . The secondary outcome pulmonary function test ( spirometry , impulse oscillometry ) exhale nitric oxide quality life ( SF-36 ) . All outcome measure baseline , 2 week , 4 week . Bronchoprovocation test methacholine perform baseline 4 week determine provocative concentration methacholine induces fall FEV1 &gt; =20 % . Adverse event record every visit . Data analysis intention-to-treat per-protocol fashion . A linear mixed-effect regression model apply assess treatment effect LCQ score , SF-36 , lung function . Within-subject variation fit model random effect whereas treatment consider fixed effect . Time measurement ( i.e. , 2- 4-week ) also include mixed model treat fixed-effect . Marginal treatment effect treatment time estimate compare .</detailed_description>
