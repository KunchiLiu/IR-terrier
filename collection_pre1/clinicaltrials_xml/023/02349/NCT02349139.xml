	<detailed_description>Parts A B include screen period ( 28 day ) 12-week treatment period . A subject serious adverse drug reaction expect benefit continued treatment opinion investigator opportunity participate long-term extension ( Part C ) . If subject candidate chooses participate long-term extension ( Part C ) , post-treatment period 4 week commence conclude end-of-study visit . Subjects participate Part A Part B approximately 9 study site visit 18 week . Part C include monthly visit study site 9 month . Thereafter , visit occur every 3 month .
