	<brief_summary>Post-cardiac arrest ischemia/reperfusion phenomenon lead organ injury failure . Among different organ , gastro-intestinal tract injury could contribute post-cardiac arrest shock . The ischemic injury gastro-intestinal ( GI ) tractus suggest abnormality digestive biomarkers frequent endotoxemia CA . However , direct mucosal damage clearly demonstrate OHCA . The real incidence ischemic lesion GI tract potential involvement post-CA shock therefore unknown . We propose original clinical research program aim rigorously determine incidence upper GI lesion OHCA analyze contribution severity post-CA shock prospective , interventional , multicentric study</brief_summary>

Procedure exams day inclusion ( day 0 ) : - collection digestive symptom - carry œsophago-gastro-duodenoscopy establishment formal report eventual lesion ischemic nature . - absence contra-indication upon final decision gastroscopist , systematic biopsy fundic , antral duodenal mucosa ; contra-indication biopsy presence vascular haemorrhagic lesion coagulation disorder . - Blood sample H. pylorus serology , serum freezing . Urinary sample urine freezing Procedure exam day 1 hospital discharge : - Daily collection digestive symptom need vasopressor support - Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score day 2 &amp; 5 - Cerebral Performance Category ( CPC ) score determination hospital discharge In case digestive symptom day 0 accordance good clinical practice , second gastroscopy and/or abdominal Computed Tomography scan ( CT-scan ) and/or colonoscopy perform physician 's discretion .</detailed_description>
