	<detailed_description>It well know mechanism acute coronary syndrome plaque rupture occlusion coronary artery plaque rupture . Although current risk assessment plaque rupture mainly focus evaluation plaque vulnerability . However , accord general mechanism material failure , plaque rupture occur whenever external hemodynamic stress exceeds durability plaque . Recently , evaluate axial plaque stress , axial component total traction act plaque , show axial plaque stress posse significantly high magnitude previously know wall shear stress . However , axial plaque stress previous research measure computational flow dynamic analysis use coronary artery model coronary CT angiography . In study , seek evaluate feasibility estimate external hemodynamic stress act plaque use invasively measure hemodynamic data pressure wire pullback tracing . In addition , also evaluate detailed plaque geometry vulnerability use optical coherence tomography along hemodynamic stress .</detailed_description>
