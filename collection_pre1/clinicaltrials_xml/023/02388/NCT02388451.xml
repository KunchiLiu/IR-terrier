	<brief_title>The Benefits Use Feuerstein Cognitive Training Method Cognitive Function Community-dwelling Older Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rise life expectancy recent decade result dramatic increase population old people . This associated rise prevalence age-associated condition , particularly cognitive impairment dementia . The prevalence dementia old 65 double every five year , reach rate 40 % age 85 year . Data World Health Organization predict 43 million dementia sufferer globally year 2020 . Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) syndrome comprise cognitive symptom impairment beyond population norm base age education , without functional loss . MCI represent risk factor dementia rate conversion approximately 12 % annually . Thus patient MCI characterize important group possible intervention prevent cognitive decline , particularly physical exercise cognitive training . The Feuerstein Program The Feuerstein Instrumental Enrichment ( IE ) program well-established effective intervention age group clinical situation . The method 's creator , Professor Reuven Feuerstein , postulate think process divide three major phase - Input , Elaboration Output - phase , different mental function work . The quality think depends upon way different function activate phase . The IE tool enable correction activation cognitive deficiency use target focused mediation , conserve reinforces cognitive ability . Recently , Feuerstein Instrumental Enrichment Program Elderly develop particularly old people cognitive decline . Instrumental Enrichment benefit senior citizen , particularly recommend constantly face intellectual challenge . The process learn IE administer group setting instructor train specifically mediate geriatric population . Work group constitute challenge , interest gratifying activity . It also appear beyond contribute conservation improvement cognition , participate program may also effect increase feeling competence , independence improve emotional state . 15 subject conform inclusion exclusion criterion know clinical diagnosis MCI provide inform consent undergo cognitive functional assessment confirm diagnosis MCI . Baseline assessment use Mindstreams Mild Cognitive Impairment Computerized Assessment Battery perform . Subjects participate 30 twice weekly meeting 90 minute duration ( total 15 week ) . Mindstreams test repeat 15 session completion study .</detailed_description>
