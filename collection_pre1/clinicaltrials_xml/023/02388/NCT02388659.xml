	<detailed_description>Malignant glioma represent majority primary brain tumor adults among intractable tumor . Cancers reprogram metabolism meet need rapid cell growth . Alterations metabolite abundance may serve biomarkers malignancy , capability monitor change non-invasively would significant clinical utility cancer . Gliomas often contain specific metabolic activity predictive genotype predictive value respect tumor stage patient survival . A high fraction glioma contain mutation metabolic enzyme , isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH ) 1 2 . These heterozygous mutation confine active site enzyme result neomorphic activity cause mutant enzyme produce `` oncometabolite '' , 2-hydroxyglutarate ( 2HG ) . Non-invasive identification onco-metabolite MRS therefore major breakthrough cancer research . Beyond simple detection 2HG , preliminary data show 2HG remarkably sensitive biomarker monitor tumor progression response treatment IDH mutate glioma . Glycine ( Gly ) biomarker tumor malignancy , indicate prior study . Our data also indicate citrate ( Cit ) elevate glioma . Over course preliminary study , crucial need 3D evaluation onco-metabolites within tumor mass . The Investigators examine clinical utility 2HG , Gly Cit , large cohort subject use multi-slice 2D MRSI 3T . The specific aim include , first , in-vivo MRS study disease specificity 2HG ( Aim 1 ) . The Investigators examine clinically prove non-glioma lesion mimic glioma clinical MRI . To increase clinical applicability result , Investigators select non-enhancing brain disease , give IDH mutation occur largely grade-2 -3 glioma , often non-enhancing . Second , Investigators examine clinical utility 2HG , Gly , Cit metabolites patient IDH mutate glioma ( Aim 2 ) . Third , Investigators examine clinical utility Gly , Cit metabolites patient IDH wild type glioma ( Aim 3 ) . In Aim 2 3 , patient undergo MRSI scan multiple time point , Investigators monitor metabolic change tumor progression response treatment . The Investigators anticipate study provide significant value many aspect management glioma . 3D evaluation cancer biomarkers use MRSI provide biological insight make diagnosis glioma , track infiltrative cell follow , determine response treatment . Success 2HG specificity study non-glioma neurological disease provide experimental evidence use non-invasive 2HG image triaging tool workup new brain mass .</detailed_description>

Patients uncontrolled psychiatric manifestation brain tumor . Children ( age &lt; 18 ) exclude study plan incidence astrocytomas glioblastoma child far less adult . Although child frequently develop brain tumor , glial tumor often pilocytic astrocytomas . In addition , enrollment adult beneficial MRS sequence validation test healthy subject since adult remain motionless MR scan compare child , give minimal motion artifact om MR data .</criteria>
