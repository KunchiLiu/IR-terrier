	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer common neoplastic disease men Finland last ten year . Prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) play important role screen prostate cancer . However , PSA limit sensitivity specificity prostate cancer detection . Commonly , diagnosis prostate cancer do transrectal ultrasonography ( TRUS ) guide biopsy . Because low accuracy TRUS systematic biopsy usually perform instead target TRUS biopsy . While , many 47 % ultra-sound guided biopsy may false negative biopsy carry risk increase complication , increase interest develop accurate non-invasive imaging modality . This study enroll 150 men previous negative biopsy clinical suspicion prostate cancer due serum level PSA high 2.5 ng/ml abnormal digital rectal examination ( DRE ) patient active surveillance due low risk prostate carcinoma . Anatomical magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) 3 Tesla ( T ) magnetic field use surface coil use non-invasively predict presence absence prostate cancer . In addition routine 12-core TRUS biopsy , target TRUS guide biopsy base MRI finding perform .</brief_summary>
