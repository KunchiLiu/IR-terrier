	<detailed_description>Intranasal ( IN ) delivery analgesic agent provide rapid convenient drug administration without need needle . In child , placement intravenous line often increase anxiety pain , require nursing time , difficult achieve , IN route particularly advantageous . IN delivery fentanyl become increasingly common pain management child many setting , include pre-hospital emergency department ( ED ) setting . Over past decade , many study demonstrate intranasal fentanyl effective intravenous morphine treat acute moderate severe pain . Intranasal fentanyl become standard care pediatric EDs advantage avoid intravenous line placement . However , adverse effect attribute IN fentanyl similar opioid analgesic : hypotension , sedation , occasionally respiratory depression . Ketamine noncompetitive N-methyl D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist block release excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate provide anesthesia , amnesia , analgesia decrease central sensitization `` wind-up '' phenomenon . Due high lipid solubility , ketamine rapidly cross blood-brain barrier , provide rapid onset action ( peak concentration 1 minute intravenous push ) rapid recovery baseline ( duration action 5-15 minute intravenous push ) . At sub-dissociative dos , either use adjunct opioid analgesic solo agent , ketamine provide effective analgesia preserve airway patency , ventilation , cardiovascular stability . Ketamine le study pain management , however safely used via different route administration child . Studies date back 1990 's use ketamine dose high 6 mg/kg intranasally child pre-medication prior surgery sedation little report adverse effect . A hospital Australia currently conduct clinical trial comparing IN fentanyl 1.5 ug/kg IN ketamine 1mg/kg treatment pain cause isolated musculoskeletal injury . The intention study similar , however investigator limit patient musculoskeletal pain simplify pain scale use . To assess pain , investigator use standard pain scale currently use Pediatric ED order minimize need re-train staff different pain scale . The scale incorporate Numerical rating scale ( 0-10 scale ; NRS ) Wong-Baker face pain scale ( 6 face correspond 0,2,4,6,8,10 ; WBS ) . While prior study use different pain scale , primarily visual analog scale ( VAS ) , scale investigator currently use validate child 2009 .</detailed_description>
