	<brief_summary>Population survey show positive correlation increase level total serum immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) bronchial hyperreactivity . However , also clear exacerbation asthma frequently trigger viral respiratory tract infection , especially cause human rhinovirus ( RV ) , also know `` common cold '' virus . This protocol explore relationship rhinovirus allergen/IgE provoke inflammation . Experimental challenge human ( RV ) result persistent upper respiratory tract symptom score asthmatic control . Asthmatics high level IgE also show great sensitivity methacholine high level expire nitric oxide ( eNO ) low level IgE . These data suggest patient asthma high level IgE likely pre-existing inflammation airway virus challenge . This study do determine whether anti-IgE therapy ( omalizumab ) lead significant decline inflammatory biomarkers prior virus inoculation , thus reduce severity clinical manifestation experimental human RV challenge .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study randomize , double-blind placebo control study involve group 42 mild asthmatic . Subjects randomize 1:1 omalizumab ( humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody ) placebo 8 week inoculate rhinovirus ( strain-16 produce GMP condition approve research FDA ) . Clinical laboratory ( mechanistic ) data evaluate 8 week 4 week virus challenge . The study do test hypothesis reduction total free IgE asthmatic treat omalizumab 8 week prior experimental RV challenge lead significant decline lower respiratory tract ( chest ) symptom record subject first four day infection follow challenge compare low respiratory tract symptom record period asthmatic subject treat placebo . The primary endpoint base comparison cumulative low respiratory tract symptom score ( CLRTS ) asthmatic subject treat omalizumab compare treat placebo first 4 day acute infection . Diary card score daily cough , shortness breath , chest discomfort wheeze use modification Jackson criterion . To participate study , subject must live within 90 minute car University Virginia . Note : This protocol review monitored safety NIH/NIAID Safety Monitoring Committee IRB University Virginia ( IRB-HSR # 14427 ) .</detailed_description>

Positive Methacholine challenge test ( i.e . least 20 % fall FEV1 Methacholine concentration â‰¤16 mg/ml ) screen protocol enrollment . Total serum IgE level great equal 125 IU/ml evaluate screen protocol . Positive test allergic sensitization prick skin test document screen protocol . allergen associated current allergen exposure time rhinovirus ( RV ) challenge : e.g. , dust mite , Alternaria , and/or ragweed subject challenge RV fall , positive test tree and/or grass pollen allergen challenge RV spring . In keep study design goal inoculate subject period allergen exposure , sensitization allergen ( e.g. , cat dog ) also qualify enrollment subject currently expose allergens home . Participant must willing comply study procedures requirement . Inability unwillingness participant subject 's legal representative give write informed consent HIPPA authorization Positive test serum neutralize antibody rhinovirus ( strain16 ) screening within 6 week ( i.e. , subject neutralize antibody titer &gt; 1:4 exclude ) . To avoid RV16 inoculation subject restrictive lung volume , whose FVC &lt; 80 % predict also exclude . Total IgE level measure screen protocol elevate base subject weight , meet recommendation treatment Omalizumab .
