	<detailed_description>The goal test ability detect improve calf muscle perfusion energetics PAD patient randomize controlled trial home exercise therapy . Eighty patient randomize 12 week home exercise program program ( control ) . Patients studied program completion MRI/MRS , calf muscle biopsy capillary density , exercise performance measure . Arterial spin label peak exercise calf muscle perfusion use primary endpoint symptomatic leg . All undergo ASL , peak exercise PCr recovery kinetics , calf muscle biopsy , functional measure include treadmill exercise , VO2 test , 6-minute walk . Correlations examine change perfusion energetics change capillary density , peak VO2 , functional capacity completion home exercise therapy .</detailed_description>
