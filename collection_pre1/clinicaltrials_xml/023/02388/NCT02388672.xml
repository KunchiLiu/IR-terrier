	<detailed_description>Coffee one favorite worldwide beverage comprise variety chemical maintain great health benefit among commonly consume beverage . Most investigation far focus beneficial effect caffeine . On contrary , knowledge potential health benefit non-caffeine coffee compound scarce . Coffee contain many polyphenols , especially chlorogenic acid ( CGA ) , purport antioxidant ability . With increase incidence degenerative disease , general public turning use natural herbal supplement , one agent , CGA biologically medically emphasize expect become topic addressed future study , medical trend pharmacology . The reduce risk variety disease follow CGA consumption mention recent basic clinical study . However , lack study examine behavioral effect CGA . This study aim fill gap . In randomized double-blind study , investigator test acute effect coffee enrich CGA CGA supplement physiological function blood pressure , blood glucose , heart rate , psychological function mood cognitive performance 30 healthy adult subject ( 18-40 year ) .
