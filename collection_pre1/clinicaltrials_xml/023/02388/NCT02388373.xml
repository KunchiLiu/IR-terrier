National guideline recommend asthma medication increase patient experience worsen asthma , reduce asthma control . However , likely daily clinical practice patient over-treated . It therefore necessary conduct study demonstrate reduce treatment dosage do safely . This study two phase . In first phase investigator aim recruit 224 patient approximately 40 clinic UK Ireland . One third patient select random use high dosage Seretide® 250 Evohaler® two third use high dose Flutiform® 250 inhaler 12 week . At end phase 1 investigator compare well asthma control two group . After phase 1 patient used Flutiform problem asthma participate phase 2 . In phase 2 half patient stay high dosage Flutiform 250 half switch medium dosage Flutiform 125 inhaler . At end phase 2 investigator compare asthma control two group . This study conduct Research Real Life Ltd ( Cambridge , UK ) partial funding Napp Pharmaceuticals Ltd .
