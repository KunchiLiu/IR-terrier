	<brief_title>Proof Mechanism Study MLN1202 Atherosclerotic Inflammation Participants With Stable Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call MLN1202 . MLN1202 test treat people stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . This study look change arterial inflammation people take MLN1202 addition standard-of-care ( SOC ) therapy . The study enroll approximately 108 participant . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - MLN1202 Dose A intravenously ( IV ) - Placebo ( dummy inactive solution ) - solution look like study drug active ingredient All participant receive IV administration MLN1202 placebo Day 1 , Day 29 , Day 57 study . This multi-centre trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study 19 week . Participants make 7 visit clinic , contact telephone approximately 35 day last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The participant , applicable , participant 's legally acceptable representative sign date write , informed consent form ( include consent pharmacogenomics [ PGx ] collection ) require privacy authorization prior initiation study procedure . 2 . Is male female age 35 80 year , inclusive Screening . 3 . Has document atherosclerotic vascular disease ( eg , coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , peripheral arterial disease , aortic atherosclerosis abdominal aortic aneurysm ( &lt; 5 cm ) , carotid disease , cerebrovascular disease ) clinically stable least 3 month prior Screening . Documentation sufficient demonstrate presence atherosclerotic vascular disease include one following : . History myocardial infarction . ii . History stroke . iii . Framingham score indicate &gt; 20 % 10year risk individual age &gt; 55 . iv . Documentation atherosclerotic disease objective diagnostic testing . 4 . Are willing undergo 2 , 2deoxy2 [ ^18F ] fluoroDg1ucose positron emission tomography ( FDG PET ) /CT scan , body weight compatible imaging center 's PET/CT scanner table limit able tolerate imaging procedure . 5 . Are statin naïve take stable statin dose AND , take statin , high dose highpotency statin . A highdose high potency statin define atorvastatin ≥40 mg/day rosuvastatin ≥20 mg/day . Furthermore , statin dose must stable least 6 week prior Screening FDG PET /CT scan must change remainder study . 1 . Has history clinical manifestation : ) Type 1 diabetes mellitus . b ) Significant heart failure ( eg , New York Heart Association class III IV ) . c ) Active chronic liver disease . ) Any chronic systemic inflammatory condition require ongoing therapy antiinflammatory drug . e ) Any history cancer , except basal cell carcinoma remission least 5 year prior Day 1 study . f ) Any infection require antibiotic therapy within 6 week prior Screening FDG PET/CT . g ) Any acute infection within 2 week Screening FDG PET/CT scan . h ) Impaired renal function ( estimate creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min calculate Cockcroft Gault formula ) . Retesting may allow case case basis . 2 . Requires ongoing therapy systemic antiinflammatory drug ( except nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug [ NSAIDs ] ) , include systemic antiinflammatory steroid , methotrexate , colchicine , antiinflammatory biologics , compound opinion investigator substantial antiinflammatory effect . 3 . Has receive treatment systemic immunosuppressant systemic anti inflammatory medication within 6 week prior Screening FDG PET/CT scan . 4 . Has history hypersensitivity allergy component study medication history hypersensitivity monoclonal antibody . 5 . Has significant medical condition ( ) , investigator 's opinion , may interfere participant 's optimal participation study . 6 . Has poorly control blood glucose , define purpose study glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) ≥7.75 % Screening . 7 . Screening FDG PET/CT scan inadequate vascular uptake ( target background ratio [ TBR ] &lt; 1.6 ) index vessel ( ascend aorta , leave carotid , right carotid ) assess image core laboratory .</criteria>
