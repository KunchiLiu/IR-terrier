	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With High Risk Locally Advanced Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore maximum tolerate dose head neck stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) high risk patient population ineligible standard chemoradiotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess profile SBRT toxicity examine patient ( include co-morbidities ) , tumor treatment related factor associate SBRT related toxicity . II . Identify dose volume parameter associate SBRT related toxicity . III . Explore potential dose response relationships high SBRT dose radiographic response . IV . Assess impact SBRT patient ' quality life . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients undergo SBRT 5 fraction least 40 hour apart 10-18 day . After completion study treatment , patient follow 0.5 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
