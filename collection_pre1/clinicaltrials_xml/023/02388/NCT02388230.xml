	<brief_summary>Around 20 % woman receive breast radiotherapy ( RT ) experience moderate severe breast hardening shrinkage . These side-effects show important factor influence quality life breast radiotherapy . It think likelihood develop side-effects relate presence underlie genetic difference patient . In order identify genetic difference , severity side-effects need accurately measure . Currently , clinical assessment conduct clinician specific enough able relate development breast shrinkage harden genetic difference . For example , clinical assessment often fail distinguish hardness due swelling ( know oedema ) hardness due generalise radiation-induced scarring ( know fibrosis ) . Ultrasound technique , however , may able help quantify characterise radiotherapy-associated change breast tissue allow good correlation genetic abnormality . Once genetic change identify , adjustment breast RT treatment ( add drug ) help reduce side-effects woman higher genetic risk side-effects may possible . This study test ability two form ultrasound , shear-wave elastography ( USE ) ultrasound backscatter spectroscopy ( UBS ) , quantify characterise breast shrinkage firmness view use technique measure late side-effects breast RT study underlie cause radiotherapy toxicity . Principle research question : Can new ultrasound technique ( shear wave elastography ) measure radiation-induced side-effects woman receive breast radiotherapy ?</brief_summary>
