	<brief_summary>This non-therapeutic , long-term follow-up ( LTFU ) study subject receive retroviral-based gene therapy product cancer study . All subject LTFU protocol receive lentiviral modify T cell engineer express anti-mesothelin scFv Chimeric Antigen Receptor ( CAR ) . This gene therapy product call CART-meso . Lentiviruses subfamily retrovirus . This protocol design adherence November 2006 Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) Guidance Industry , `` Monitoring Delayed Adverse Events '' `` Supplemental Guidance Testing Replication Competent Retrovirus Retroviral Vector Based Gene Therapy Products During Follow-up Patients Clinical Trials Using Retroviral Vectors `` involve 15 year monitor subject expose retrovirus-mediated gene transfer . Subjects undergo biannual visit blood test evaluate persistence cell retroviral vector sequence , chemistry , hematology tumor marker ( applicable ) . On annual visit , subject undergo physical exam medical history ( include concomitant medication adverse event ) careful attention feature possibly relate retrovirus-induced disease</brief_summary>
