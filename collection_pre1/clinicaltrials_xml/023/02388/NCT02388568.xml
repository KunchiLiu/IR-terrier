	<brief_summary>The propose 12-month randomized control trial ass efficacy lifestyle counseling , combine lorcaserin ( 10 mg BID ) placebo , maintain weight loss achieve prior 14-week dietary run-in . 14-week run-in . To qualify randomization , participant must lose ≥5 % initial weight 14-week dietary run-in . This loss achieve provision weekly , group lifestyle counseling , include 1000-1200 kcal/day portion-controlled diet combine four daily serving liquid diet ( HMR shake ) even meal frozen-food entree ( fruit vegetable serve ) . More 70 % participant expect achieve 5 % criterion loss 14-week run-in . A total 182 woman men BMI ≥33 ≤55 kg/m2 , without co-morbidities , ≥30 ≤55 kg/m2 ( co-morbid cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) condition ) enrol 4-month run-in period . Prior enrollment , participant history , physical exam , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , appropriate blood test . They attend weekly group session 14 week . Participants brief medical visit week 8 check health blood test repeat . The investigator anticipate 136 ( 75 % ) participant lose 5 % initial weight qualify randomization . Participants lose 5 % provided list weight loss resource ( e.g. , program ) facilitate continue weight management . 12-month randomized trial lorcaserin . A total 136 participant lose 5 % initial weight run-in period randomly assign , double-blind fashion , lorcaserin ( 10 mg BID ) match placebo . To eligible , participant must BMI ( prior weight loss ) ≥30 kg/m2 ( without co-morbidities ) great equal ≥27 ( co-morbidity ) . Randomization perform Investigational Drug Service Hospital University Pennsylvania . Prior randomization , participant complete second brief history physical examination , well EKG blood test . Medication dispense randomization visit brief medical visit follow . Over 1 year , participant participate 16 group lifestyle modification class design weight loss maintenance , approximately half deliver group conference call . Primary outcome measure . The primary endpoint change body weight ( kg ) , measure randomization month 12 . The co-primary end-point percentage participant two group , month 12 , maintain ≥5 % reduction body weight achieve 14-week dietary run-in period . Secondary efficacy endpoint include change CVD risk factor , glycemic control , quality life , measure randomization month 12 . Exploratory endpoint include change CVD relate outcome , measure start 14-week run-in period month 12 . The investigator also examine percentage participant two group month 12 achieved loss ≥5 % , ≥10 % , ≥15 % initial weight , measure start run-in period . Safety endpoint include physical examination , electrocardiogram , adverse event ( AEs ) , standard laboratory test , mental health assess Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) . Statistical Analysis . The planned sample size 136 participant , 1:1 randomization ratio , assumes 20 % drop-out rate ( month 12 ) estimate adequate evaluate primary endpoint power ≥90 % ( P=0.05 , two-sided test ) . The investigator predict difference weight change two group ( randomization month 12 ) 4 kg ( SD=3.5 ) .
