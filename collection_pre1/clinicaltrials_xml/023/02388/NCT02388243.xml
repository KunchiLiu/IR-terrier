	<detailed_description>The purpose project answer challenge integration screen core package Mental Health ( MH ) Substance Use Disorder ( SUD ) service routine primary health care ( PHC ) innovative e-learning technology . The training health professional Kenya ( LMIC ) limit content address alcohol , tobacco substance use disorder PHC . The investigator aim help address problem adapt NextGenU train model capacity-building health care provider LMIC provide SUD screen core service PHC . NextGenU.org draw already-existing , free , expert-created competency computer-based learning resource accredit source assemble course certify network partner . The computer-based didactic learning experience complement 1 ) peer-to-peer interaction local global community learner simultaneously study topic , 2 ) use local qualify mentor , supplement training take account local variation organizational structure , culture , tradition belief . The intervention evaluate program research include train lay health worker facility support staff screen patient present facility . Those support staff refer moderate high risk tobacco , alcohol substance use train PHC clinician brief intervention ( BI ) relate substance use risky level . The training intervention include teach clinician deliver BI , identify manage co-morbidities complication . The program research around intervention include ( 1 ) developmental evaluation on-line training pilot student clinical faculty educational institution , follow assessment training already practice health care provider field ; ( 2 ) pre post training assessment clinicians non-clinicians knowledge , attitude skill ( include assess level stigma toward use psychoactive substance ) ; ( 3 ) RCTs assess impact BI alcohol consumption health social variable interest public private facility ; ( 4 ) assessment impact quality improvement training sustainability screen BI . This trial registration RCTs . Two independently power RCTs , one private facility one public facility , run . The rational run two independently power RCT study PHC worker train depression LMIC show intervention implement public facility successful improve patient ' outcome , private facility . However , since large proportion population use private facility , investigator want exclude private facility participate . The RCT public institution take place two rural county , Machakos Makueni , choose similar term geography socio-demographic characteristic , pretty typical rural county Kenya LMIC . They population 700,000 , moderate burden substance abuse Kenya . The RCT private health care institution ( CliniX Shalom ) take place Nairobi metropolitan area . The Shalom facility technically County Machakos , close Nairobi city limit serve similar population CliniX facility ( urban middle class Kenyans afford private health care consultation pocket insurance workplace ) . The RCTs complement qualitative methodology monitor aspect besides clinical effectiveness intervention . On-going result share stakeholder , may result adapted implementation training study progress , per developmental evaluation methodology . The context rationale change document part research process , expect inform development innovation , include scalability . The methodology RCTs base methodology follow Flemming et al study BI alcohol . These highly-ranked study include late version Cochrane meta-analysis brief alcohol intervention . Eligible site RCTs include offer PHC , willing able participate training program ( access electricity , internet cell phone network , staff express interest train ) , sufficient number clinician support staff complete training screen deliver BI , amenable follow research protocol . The investigator aim enlist training least 4 public facility per district , 4 private facility , uncertainty many clinic staff complete training . At clinic , community health worker ( public facility ) complementary staff ( private clinic ) offer patient present consultation age 18 year old screen healthy lifestyle receive feedback result . The person perform screen obtain consent specifically participate screening . To mask topic trial early stage avoid potential stigmatization participant , study present one general lifestyle ( do Flemming et al . study ) . The screen include self-reported weight height , ( body mass index - BMI ) , level physical activity , Alcohol , Smoking Substance Involvement Screening Test ( ASSIST ) . The inclusion BMI level physical activity mask purpose intervention , decrease focus substance use . The lay health worker provide result BMI , physical activity ASSIST offer leaflets explanation lifestyle . The screener send screen moderate risk alcohol use research assistant ( RA ) . The RA offer patient participate RCTs , assess eligibility , obtain consent , collect baseline data demographic , randomize patient either BI intervention ( patient already receive screening result ) . The RA explain study lifestyle , without disclose ask participate level risk due alcohol . Those eligible randomize either BI control group separately men woman site use computer-generated allocation method . All practitioner control intervention subject practice . Those BI arm ask research staff show discuss clinician screen result . The clinician deliver BI alcohol use reach moderate high risk level ASSIST well advice stop consumption harmful level substance report patient . The BI include discussion risky level alcohol consumption , associate adverse effect , follow adapted ASSIST BI step Kenya , include ask patient come back follow-up month BI . Clinicians record baseline follow-up clinical assessment management clinical follow-up form . The total BI around 15 minute , follow-up visit length . Any follow-up discretion clinician , part on-going PHC . To blind subject control intervention allocation , tell trial focus healthy lifestyle include weight , substance use , exercise . The clinician complementary health worker tell patient randomize control intervention arm . This methodology ensure appropriate concealment prevent contamination . The participant control intervention arm contact follow-up interview one , three six month assess outcomes . Sub-samples control intervention subject select participation focus group seek input experience use new knowledge skill practice , might improve Kenyan context . Those patient ineligible basis increase acute risk ask discuss ASSIST result PHC provider . The primary outcome variable interest difference mean alcohol consumption ( previous 7 14 day use measure g/week ) subject intervention group control group , collect timeline follow-back assessment . A statistical test frequently use type study independent sample t-test . We use SPSS SamplePower calculator estimate sample size need achieve 80 % power , two-tailed level significance ( alpha ) 0.05 . We use number gram alcohol consume per week obtain 1997 Flemming trial : mean ( SD ) 137.7 ( 135.7 ) g/wk intervention group , 185.5 ( 155.2 ) control group . The sample size need n=146 arm . The average consumption Flemming trial low side , difference mean reduction similar study adequate allocation concealment include Cochrane review . The assumption use estimate recruitment period need reach sample size follow : Using conservative estimate number visit per day 18 year old ( 30 visit public clinic 55 visit private clinic ) , 10 % prevalence moderately risky level alcohol use , base study conduct similar PHC centre Kenya use ASSIST ; subtract return patient ( average 30 % ) . An enrollment 80 % assume . This conservative estimate , since enrollment reach 95 % previous study drug alcohol use mental illness , conduct AMHF . Based assumption , 570 patient public clinic 520 private clinic enrol three month . Loss follow-up estimate 10 % one month , another 10 % three month , another 10 % six month . At six month follow-up expect approximately 370 recruited patient public clinic 340 patient private clinic . This would result sufficient power detect expect decrease consumption separately public private sector . If unforeseen reason , estimate needed sample size reach three month , enrollment period extend , still capacity 6 month follow-up recruited subject . The low average effect size obtain include study Cochrane review , despite lack adequate concealment methodological issue , reduction 33g/week . Using two-tailed t-test , consumption intervention group 117g/week versus consumption 150 g/week control group , SD 120 95 % CI ( -53.66 , -12.34 ) intention treat sample initial enrollment 520 ( 260 arm ) , study power 87.9 % yield statistically significant result . The effect size use average across men woman . The study power assess separate effect gender , sub-analyses estimate effect gender covariate do . Potential confounders effect modifier test multiple linear logistic regression model depend distribution outcome variable . The longitudinal data across four propose time point analyze use general linear model , repeat measure technique , order understand effect variation due group ( i.e. , between-groups effect ) due follow-up time ( i.e. , within-groups effect ) . An interaction term group follow-up time also fit . Missing data handle multiple imputation technique necessary .</detailed_description>
