	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy ( RT ) important treatment prostate cancer 10,000 men receive RT per year UK . Prostate RT aim deliver radiation dose prostate kill cancer cell whilst minimize dose give surround normal tissue , bladder rectum . Radiation deliver number daily treatment call 'fractions ' . The position prostate varies day radiation delivery . To accurately aim radiation prostate need locate daily treatment . Clarity ultrasound image guidance system locate prostate monitor position treatment . Ultrasound give radiation dose , non-invasive , provide fast imaging easily visualise soft tissue . Before Clarity implement investigator wish ensure accurately locate monitor prostate compare Clarity marker-based technique 24 patient . Patients receive marker part trial currently recruit The Royal Marsden ( example , patient DELINEATE trial PACE trial receive implant gold marker patient PROSPARE trial receive electromagnetic marker ) . Patients receive receive marker part study ask also take part study . This mean additional intervention patient result study . Clarity consider safe effective imaging system mean standard deviation difference Clarity measurement marker measurement , prostate position , less 1mm . It possible marker influence Clarity measurement . To find happens , mean standard deviation Clarity measurement group 24 patient without marker group marker compare . Primary Aim : To evaluate accuracy Clarity ultrasound image guidance system prostate motion estimation treatment ( intra-fraction ) , comparison implant marker-based image guidance technique . Primary Hypothesis : Clarity safely use deliver radiotherapy use similar ( within 1mm ) treatment margin would employ fiducial marker base image guidance technique use .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Two patient group two patient volunteer group recruit : Groups 1 : Patient volunteer receive radiotherapy prostate cancer include plan CT scan , currently receive radiotherapy . Groups 2 3 : Patients receive radiotherapy prostate cancer part clinical trial standard care include gold FM EM insertion Patients previously receive RT prostate cancer include EM insertion . Group 4 : Patients receive radiotherapy prostate cancer receive FMs . Attempts make match Group 4 patient BMI time receive hormone therapy patient group 2 3 ( see , section 6.1 recruitment . Groups 1 4 : Patients receive prostatectomy . Groups 2 4 : Patients receive less 6 RT fraction . Group 4 : Patients receive FMs EMs .</criteria>
