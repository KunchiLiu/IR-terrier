	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether mechanoreceptor sensitivity sole foot increase increase foot temperature heighten sensation may improve characteristic balance control gait . As extension , investigator also want determine whether low limb movement efficient activity increase foot temperature . There several objective study . The investigator want determine effect active recovery ( via low limb movement ) increase plantar temperature , determine effect increase plantar temperature plantar sensation determine effect increase plantar sensation balance control gait characteristic . Participants ask complete various task different condition . Conditions include decreased foot temperature via ice bath emersion , baseline foot temperature ( participant 's normal temperature ten minute equilibration period ) , increased foot temperature via active movement low limb . Tasks include walk across room , perform active movement low limb 10 minute treadmill walk . Gait movement collect three-dimensional motion capture system ( Optotrak ) force plate . Feet temperature sensation information collect temperature probe ( infrared ) monofilaments .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Between 10-15 healthy young adult male female recruit . A screening questionnaire administer ensure participant appropriate study . Upon arrival , participant require sit foot slightly elevate ground , rest stool 10 minute allow adjustment room temperature ( equilibration ) . During time , participant complete questionnaire regard experience temperature foot include question similar , `` On average would say cold foot , average foot warm foot ? Describe foot 's ability adapt temperature change . Do experience tingle feel bottom foot ? '' Following equilibration period , researcher place 12 infrared marker participant . The participant receive brief outline procedure appropriate instruction begin experiment . All trial perform barefoot . There total 3 type test . The first monofilament test . The researcher apply vary monofilaments sizes participant ' sol foot . These test include measure touch sensation sole foot . The second One Leg Stance Test participant stand force plate , balance one leg 30 second per trial Optotrak information collect . The participant complete total 3 trial . The third Gait Termination Test participant instruct walk along 6 metre 2 force plate . A total 10 trial complete 3 randomized trial participant instructed terminate gait unexpectedly ( buzzer ) reach force plate . Optotrak information collect simultaneously . The researcher record plantar temperature intermittently test different condition . The infrared temperature probe make contact skin . The specific outline procedure include order condition task explain . The first condition Baseline Condition 3 type test administer . Then participant 's foot immerse ice bath 2-3 degree Celsius 10-15 minute ( foot temperature record every 2 minute ) preparation Decreased Feet Temperature Condition . Here , 3 type test administer . Then participant actively recover walk treadmill speed 3.5 miles/hour grade 0 % 10 minute , prepare Increased Feet Temperature Condition . Intermittent foot temperature measurement take every 2 minute treadmill walk . After 10 minute walk , 3 type test administer . This end experiment .</detailed_description>
