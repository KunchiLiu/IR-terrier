	<detailed_description>The addition concurrent chemotherapy definitive radiation improve 5-year survival woman locally advanced cervical cancer 58 % , much room improvement . Post-therapy FDG-PET 3 month help predict progression-free overall survival . Tumors continually shed DNA circulation , accessed measure disease burden . Cervical cancer cause Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) ; plasma HPV DNA could use monitor response detect recurrence early . While plasma HPV DNA show correlate prognosis predict recurrence cancer , limited data locally advanced cervical cancer . This prospective multi-institutional study recruit 20 patient locally advanced cervical cancer determine plasma HPV DNA predate clinical recurrence and/or improve accuracy response post-therapy FDG-PET scan 3 month . Patients undergo phlebotomy follow time-points measurement circulate HPV DNA level : ) baseline ; b ) end radiotherapy ; c ) 3 month post completion chemoradiation , along 3-month FDG-PET ) recurrence . This study provide preliminary estimate correlation plasma HPV DNA level , PET find clinical outcome , inform sample size calculation large study . If prove useful future , plasma HPV DNA could enable identification patient high risk recurrence individualize treatment .</detailed_description>
