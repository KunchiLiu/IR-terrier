	<brief_title>INVAC-1 Anti-Cancer hTERT DNA Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first-in-patient study INVAC-1 , DNA vaccine encode human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) . hTERT catalytic subunit telomerase complex synthesize telomeric DNA chromosome end . hTERT overexpressed human tumor virtually type cancer . INVAC-1 develop cancer therapy . Stimulation immune system direct telomerase express cancer cell potential generate tumor response . The study design evaluate safety pharmacodynamics ( PD ) INVAC-1 administer alone intradermal route adult solid tumor malignancy . As show non-clinical study , efficacy vaccine enhance electroporation , thus combine vaccination present study . The general clinical plan include development INVAC-1 hematologic malignancy solid tumor , single agent combination target anticancer agent check-points inhibitor , radiotherapy chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
