	<brief_title>Validation Aspiration Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present standard method evaluation vivo cuff leak aspiration . Most tested technique major pitfall render routine application infeasible . Lacking practical reliable marker , possible intervention aim improve cuff seal ETT performance order reduce VAP occurrence go hindered inability truly evaluate efficacy . Radiolabeled marker expensive , expose patient considerable radiological risk , require transport radiological department , would expose critically ill patient additional risk . Dyes potential give useful information presence cuff leak , due persistent stain secretion , allow continuous monitoring aspiration . Amylase detection could good marker aspiration , ability detect aspiration poor even compare pepsin . Pepsin bile acid potential detect aspiration cuff leak happen daily mechanically ventilated patient , due gastrointestinal nature , offer kind information aspiration contaminate oropharyngeal secretion . With research protocol , would like validate use diatom skeleton suspend saline marker determine cuff leakage aspiration event ICU population compare efficacy identify aspiration event pepsin detection . Diatoms major group algae , compose majority phytoplankton . Their diameter 5-15 μm average 1 ml seawater usually contain 104 diatom . They unicellular organism main feature enclose within cell wall make amorphous silica , biopolymerized geometric fashion species-dependent . At end vital cycle , diatom shell deposit bottom sea . Diatom shell deposit find almost every place Earth , main component diatomaceous earth ( DE ) . DE extremely fine powder compose diatom shell accumulate thousand year . Due microscopical texture inexpensive nature , commonly employ filter medium beverage dry anti-mold agent cereal . Diatom shell compose food-grade DE entirety . Due non-crystalline , amorphous nature , essentially nontoxic . Our hypothesis administration 10 mg DE suspend 10 ml saline pharyngeal cavity intubate patient act reliable marker cuff leak aspiration critically ill patient . Thanks geometric shape , diatom shell easily detectable tracheal secretion observe microscope . The number diatoms-per-field observe fixed magnification allow detection microaspiration qualitative quantitative way . The introduction new , safe inexpensive marker evaluate ETT cuff performance detect aspiration improve design future study aim VAP prevention</detailed_description>
