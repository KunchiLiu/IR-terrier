	<brief_summary>This open label , multicenter , non-comparative , phase IV study panitumumab monotherapy Indian subject previously treat , wild-type Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ) wild-type Neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral ( v-ras ) oncogene homolog ( NRAS ) , metastatic colorectal cancer . This study design fulfil requirement Indian regulatory authority characterize safety tolerability panitumumab administer Indian subject wild-type KRAS wild-type NRAS metastatic colorectal cancer . Approximately 58 Indian subject previously treat wild-type KRAS wild-type NRAS , metastatic colorectal cancer enrol order achieve target enrollment 50 evaluable subject receive least one dose panitumumab . Subjects receive panitumumab 6 milligram/kilogram ( mg/kg ) intravenously every 14 day disease progression , intolerability , withdrawal consent , death . All subject follow 4 week 8 week last administration panitumumab , unless treatment discontinue due withdrawal consent death subject .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject subject 's legally acceptable representative provide informed consent . Male female &gt; =18 year age . Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis adenocarcinoma colon rectum . Metastatic disease . Wildtype KRAS ( without mutation exon 2 [ codon 12 13 ] , exon 3 [ codon 59 61 ] , exon 4 [ codon 117 146 ] ) wildtype NRAS ( without mutation exon 2 [ codon 12 13 ] , exon 3 [ codon 59 61 ] , exon 4 [ codon 117 146 ] ) tumor status . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 2 . Measurable nonmeasurable disease per RECIST Version 1.1 . Must fail fluoropyrimidine , oxaliplatin , irinotecancontaining chemotherapy regimens metastatic disease . Failure define either disease progression ( clinical radiological ) intolerance regimen . Metastatic relapse within 6 month complete adjuvant chemotherapy ( either irinotecan oxaliplatin contain regimen ) also consider treatment failure prior regimen metastatic disease . Laboratory : Adequate baseline organ function define ( &lt; =7 day prior first dose study treatment ) . Hematologic function , follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; =1.5 x 10^9/Liter ( L ) , Platelet count &gt; =75 x 10^9/L , Hemoglobin &gt; =8.0 gram/deciliter ( g/dL ) . Renal function , follow : Creatinine &lt; =1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Hepatic function , follow : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; =3 x ULN , Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; =3 x ULN , Total Bilirubin &lt; =1.5 x ULN . Metabolic function , follow : Serum Magnesium within normal limit . Serum Calcium within normal limit . Serum Potassium within normal limit . All prior treatment related toxicity common terminology criterion adverse event ( CTCAE ) version 4.03 &lt; =Grade 1 time enrollment . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day first dose study treatment agree use adequate contraception , study 2 month follow last dose study treatment . Men female partner childbearing potential must either prior vasectomy agree use adequate contraception , time signing inform consent 5 month last dose study treatment . History know presence central nervous system metastasis . History another malignancy except : Malignancy treat curative intent know active disease present &gt; =5 year prior enrolment felt low risk recurrence treat physician ; Adequately treat nonmelanomatous skin cancer lentigo maligna without evidence disease ; Adequately treat cervical carcinoma situ without evidence disease ; Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia without evidence prostate cancer . Known immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate panitumumab excipients contraindicate participation . Prior antiepidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFr ) antibody therapy ( e.g. , panitumumab cetuximab ) treatment small molecule EGFr inhibitor ( e.g. , gefitinib , erlotinib , lapatinib ) . Antitumor therapy ( e.g. , chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , immunotherapy , antibody therapy , radiotherapy ) , investigational agent therapy &lt; =30 day first dose study treatment recover acute toxicity . Other investigational procedure &lt; =30 day study entry . History interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) e.g. , interstitial pneumonitis , pulmonary fibrosis evidence ILD baseline chest computer tomography . Subject previously enrol study . History keratitis , ulcerative keratitis severe dry eye . Major surgery ( e.g. , require general anesthesia ) &lt; =30 day first dose study treatment . Subjects must recover surgery related toxicity . Minor surgical procedure ( e.g. , open biopsy ) &lt; =7 day first dose study treatment , yet recover prior minor surgery Note : uncomplicated placement vascular access device , fine needle aspiration , thoracocentesis paracentesis &gt; =3 day prior first dose study treatment acceptable . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease ( include myocardial infarction , unstable angina , symptomatic congestive heart failure , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia ) &lt; =6 month prior enrolment . History medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality opinion investigator may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration , compliance study procedure may interfere interpretation result . Unstable pulmonary embolism , deep vein thrombosis , significant arterial/venous thromboembolic event &lt; =30 day first dose study treatment . If anticoagulation , subject must stable therapeutic dose prior first dose study treatment . Subject pregnant breast feeding , plan become pregnant treatment within 2 month discontinuation study treatment . Known positive test ( ) human immunodeficiency virus infection ( test require absence clinical suspicion ) . Active infection require systemic treatment uncontrolled infection &lt; =14 day prior first dose study treatment ( exception uncomplicated urinary tract infection upper respiratory tract infection ) . Subject kind disorder compromise ability subject give write informed consent and/or comply study procedure unwilling unable comply study requirement .</criteria>
