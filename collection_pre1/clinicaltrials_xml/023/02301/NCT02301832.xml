	<brief_summary>This study intend evaluate non-invasive device us light measure amount oxygen muscle injure non-injured leg specific situation . The name technology NIRS ( near-infrared spectroscopy ) . The goal study collect information necessary understand use NIRS monitoring system diagnose direct treatment decision case complication sometimes experience traumatic tibia fracture , excessive swelling call acute compartment syndrome ( ACS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reliability Sensor Spacing NIRS Traumatic Tibia Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study seek develop use NIRS technology diagnosis acute compartment syndrome . NIRS value normally increase traumatized leg compare contralateral uninjured leg forearm , indicative hyperemic response . The investigator hop build upon current knowledge verify ability accurately detect ACS use two easily identify accessible leg compartment , anterior superficial posterior utilize Nonin 7600 oximeter Sensor Model 8004CV . Additionally , since device originally design brain tissue mind , NIRS device collect vital engineering data use validate algorithm use produce oxygenation value injure muscle tissue .</detailed_description>
