	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : 1 . Vitamin D Deficiency Vitamin D deficiency common United States worldwide , include infant child 1,2 . Moderate severe deficiency child manifest rickets , skeletal disease result failure mineralization develop bone cartilage . In industrialized country , infantile vitamin D supplementation represent standard care lead dramatic reduction incidence rickets . However , many develop country , rickets remain public health problem 3.In addition , recent literature indicate may resurgence rickets even industrialized country 4 , especially among immigrant population 5 . Potential extraskeletal effect vitamin D deficiency also increasingly recognize , include increase susceptibility type 1 diabetes , insulin resistance metabolic syndrome , pulmonary disease asthma , pneumonia tuberculosis , possible modulation innate immune system 6 . Growing child severe vitamin D deficiency , commonly define serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D ( 25OHD ) level less 8 ng/ml , great risk rickets undergo diagnostic evaluation . When physical exam finding bow weight-bearing extremity , rachitic rosary , frontal bossing evident , level serum alkaline phosphatase indicator increase bone turnover calcium mobilization bone use screen test 4,7 . X-rays knee wrist typically obtain confirm diagnosis establish baseline follow . The vitamin D status prevalence vitamin D deficiency Haitian population study . The prevalence rickets also unknown . Two study conduct Puerto Rican child 8 newly immigrate adult Caribbean background 9 found prevalence rate 47 % 59 % , respectively , suggest possibility moderate high prevalence rate Haiti . The best indicator ass vitamin D status 25OHD metabolite , major circulate form vitamin D 10 . There international consensus definition vitamin D deficiency . The Institute Medicine define deficiency 25OHD &lt; 20ng/mL suggest level maintain threshold healthy child adolescents 11 . The Endocrine Society recommendation aim child adult chronic condition place risk low bone mass and/or vitamin D deficiency , recommend use level 30 ng/mL ( 80 nmol/L ) define insufficiency 20 ng/mL ( 50 nmol/L ) define deficiency 6 . The Endocrine Society treatment guideline vitamin D deficiency child 0-18 year suggest administer oral vitamin D3 2000 IU daily 50,000 IU weekly 6 week , follow age-appropriate maintenance dose . In resource limited setting , laboratory facility vitamin D test frequently unavailable . A point-of-care testing method would greatly facilitate screen vitamin D deficiency insufficiency . The test 4D novel point-of-care test device yet FDA license . Only manufacturer base information test accuracy currently available . The device test child ( package insert attach protocol ) . 2 . Iodine Deficiency Iodine deficiency result hypothyroidism lead cause preventable neuro-developmental delay cognitive impairment worldwide . Young infants child especially susceptible sequelae disruption thyroid function give dependence develop brain sufficient level thyroid hormone . Urinary iodine establish gold standard assessment iodine status12 . Values 100-199 mcg/L consider optimal , whereas level &lt; 100 mcg/L , &lt; 50 mcg/dL &lt; 20 mcg/dL define mild , moderate severe iodine deficiency , respectively . On hand , risk iodine induce hyperthyroidism increase level rise 200 mcg/dl , risk adverse health consequence increase level exceed 300 mcg/L12 . Perchlorate thiocyanate environmental chemical know inhibit sodium-iodine symporter administer pharmacologic dos . This lead interference normal thyroidal iodine uptake result decrease thyroid hormone production13,14 . Both chemical undergo significant metabolism readily detect urine . The effect environmental exposure either think dependent adequate iodine , thus assess concurrent urinary iodine status14 . Studies assess iodine status Haiti number mainly include school-age child adult . Three study school-aged child conduct 1996 2002 find moderate severe iodine deficiency , urinary iodine level range 38.8 43.4 mcg/dL15-17 , regardless whether child coastal15,16 mountainous regions17 survey . One study find elevate TSH value &gt; 5 mU/L 78.5 % participants15 . A recent study conduct 2008 examine 88 subject age 2 72 year , find similar median urinary iodine concentration18 . Overall , 60 90 % Haitian population may iodine deficient17-19 , 20 % fall range severe deficiency18 . Based WHO data 2005 2006 , 3 % household consume adequately iodize salt19 . No study conduct infant child age 5 years.. The propose study first assess iodine status Haitian infant young child . The study conduct 3 different geographical area country , include urban setting ( Port-au-Prince ) , mountainous region ( Central Plateau ) , coastal area ( Saint Marc ) attempt differentiate area iodine deficiency likely ( Central Plateau ) less likely ( Saint Marc ) . For first time , urinary iodine concentration young child obtain along clinical goiter assessment , concentration urinary perchlorate thiocyanate , well thyroid function study ( thyroid stimulate hormone free thyroxine ) . Confirmation iodine deficiency may significant public health implication one vulnerable population : infant young child . Improving access iodize salt and/or iodine supplementation could major impact reduce number child ( future adult ) hypothyroidism-related mental retardation . The study result may raise awareness medical provider regard problem iodine deficiency relate hypothyroidism , may provide incentive test child hypothyroidism . There may major clinical implication , include ability detect treat affect child , improve prognosis regard cognitive impairment . On large scale , depend magnitude problem , study finding may underline need assess iodine deficiency hypothyroidism even young infant , include newborn . Results may obviate need newborn screen program hypothyroidism Haiti . 3 . Lead Intoxication Lead intoxication significant cause disease throughout world . Millions people suffer effect lead poison . Although developed country take drastic measure limit environmental lead level , many country develop world able address , even ass , problem . Lead poison medical condition cause increased level lead body . Lead highly toxic heavy metal environmental toxicant nerve poison contribute destruction many developmental function interfere variety body process . Due insidious nature , lead cause subtle sometimes unnoticeable effect child . Even low level lead exposure among child associate developmental problem include impaired cognitive function , reduce intelligence , impaired hearing , reduce stature damage bone marrow 20,21 . Lead poison cause severe toxicity include convulsion , coma , death 22 . In United States , Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) define elevate child BLL ≥ 10 µg/dL . At BLL , CDC give permission initiate public health action . Additionally , CDC also recommend child BLLs ≥ 45 µg/dL receive intensive medical management chelation therapy 23 prevent irreversible damage child . Among develop country , major source childhood lead poison include lead mining smelting , paint , lead gasoline , battery recycling , traditional medicine 24,25 Despite abundance lead contain material available develop country , still limited number study actually document environmental lead contamination . Even documented case , information limit adult live small-scale gold ore-processing community 26-29 . Despite many advance treatment lead poison US , still paucity information childhood lead poison developing world . The propose study document lead level pediatric population three different region Haiti . Data obtain study may lead clinically relevant prognostic , diagnostic therapeutic modality . This information may use implement even eradicate lead public health hazard . STUDY OBJECTIVES Our objective study follow three component 300 Haitian child 9 month 6 year age three different geographical area Haiti : 1 ) Vitamin D status prevalence rickets , environmental factor associate low vitamin D level , accuracy efficacy vitamin D point-of-care testing ( POCT ) device screen vitamin D insufficiency . 2 ) Iodine status thyroid function , environmental disruptors perchlorate thiocyanate potential risk factor abnormal thyroid function . 3 ) Lead level extent childhood lead poisoning . Aim 1 : To determine proportion child vitamin D insufficiency , deficiency severe deficiency , define serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD ) level &lt; 30ng/ml , &lt; 20 ng/ml , &lt; 10 ng/ml , respectively . Aim 2 : To determine proportion child high risk rickets define vitamin D deficiency elevation alkaline phosphatase . Aim 3 : To determine extent dietary vitamin D intake sun exposure relate serum 25OHD level . Aim 4 : To correlate result vitamin D POCT device serum 25OHD level . Aim 5 : To determine prevalence iodine deficiency . Aim 6 : To assess subject ' thyroid function ( TSH free T4 ) . Aim 7 : To screen urinary presence two potential environmental disruptors thyroid hormone production . Aim 8 : To determine correlation abnormal thyroid function , geographical area , presence urinary perchlorate thiocyanate iodine status . Aim 9 : To determine mean range blood lead level ( BLL ) . Aim 10 : To determine proportion child blood lead level ( BLL ) ≥ 10 µg/dL .</detailed_description>
