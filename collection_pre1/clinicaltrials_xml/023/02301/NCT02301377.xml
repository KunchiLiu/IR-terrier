	<brief_title>Exploring Novel Interventions Improve Adherence Children With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial ass impact home lung function monitor medication reminder adherence , clinical outcome quality life child cystic fibrosis ( CF ) 10 21 year age . Participants randomly assign either intervention group control group . Those intervention group receive personal spirometer device provide medication reminder allow lung function monitoring home . The control group receive current standard care . All participant aware adherence monitor course study use prescription refill data . Changes lung function , body mass index rate hospitalization use measure clinical outcome . Responses age-appropriate well-validated patient questionnaire use assess impact investigator interventions quality life perception treatment burden . Since device never previously study patient population , investigator would like pilot study 5 patient ( 3 intervention group 2 control group ) 3-month period determine feasibility . This also help u investigator power calculation ultimately decide number participant need large study .</detailed_description>
