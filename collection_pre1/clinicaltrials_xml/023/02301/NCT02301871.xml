	<brief_summary>A long term habitual posture abnormal loading ligament muscle , lead development neck pain . 33 patient include 18 male 15 female select randomly allocate three group use seal opaque envelope contain treatment allocation . Group A ( n=11 ) receive conventional treatment MHP ( Moist Heat Pack ) , Static Stretching exercise , Cervical spine non-thrust mobilization , Cervical spine active ROM ( Range Motion ) exercise Postural exercise . Group B ( n=11 ) receive DNF train conventional treatment . Group C ( n=11 ) receive Muscle Energy Technique ( MET ) additional conventional treatment . Primary outcome measure functional disability secondary measure pain ROM record baseline , 7th day 14th day.One-way ANOVA use within group analysis . Repeated measure ANOVA follow post hoc analysis employ group comparison . The result suggest significant improvement mean change score Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) , Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) Range Motion ( ROM ) .Both DNF train MET additional therapeutic effect standard care reduce functional disability , pain improve ROM mechanical neck pain patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According Janda , postural muscle tendency get shorten , normal pathological condition . Upper trapezius , levator scalpulae scalene common postural muscle . Additionally , longus colli longus capitis ( DNF ) important role postural support impair activation lead neck pain . More recently , muscle base treatment approach MNP evolve passive treatment technique myofascial release towards active treatment technique MET DNF training . Group A ( N=11 ) receive conventional treatment 5 day per week 2 week MHP ( Moist Heat Pack ) 20 minute , Static Stretching exercise upper trapezius , levator scapulae scalene muscle hold 10-30 seconds- repeat 3-5 time , Cervical spine non-thrust mobilization ( Grade 3 ) give segment C2-C7 oscillate 10 repetition , follow 10 second rest segment , Cervical spine active ROM ( Range Motion ) exercise 10 repetitions- 2-3 time day Postural exercise give home programme . Group B ( N=11 ) receive DNF train along conventional treatment . In programme , emphasis place first attain correct craniocervical flexion action , minimal activity superficial cervical flexor muscle . The craniocervical flexion action involve specific craniocervical movement ( nod - `` yes '' movement ) head remain contact support surface . Once correct action achieve , participant instruct use sphygmomanometer guide train Craniocervical Flexors muscle contraction various incremental level pressure ( 22 30 mmHg , progressively inner range position ) . Group C ( N=11 ) receive MET additional conventional treatment . MET apply Upper trapezius , Levator scapulae Scalene Following 7-10 second isometric contraction complete relaxation element , stretch maintain 30 second . The effort counter-pressure modest ( 20 % available strength ) painless . The process repeat 3-5 time .</detailed_description>
