	<brief_title>A Non-interventional Study Diafer Subjects With CKD Haemodialysis Treatment Iron Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parenteral iron iron treatment choice haemodialysis ( HD ) patient Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) , may suffer absolute iron deficiency due continuous blood loss and/or functional iron deficiency due erythropoiesis stimulate agent treatment impaired release iron store . Much evidence indicate adequate iron supply necessary achieve optimal response ESAs thereby potentially avoid ESA induce ADRs . Pharmacosmos work dialysis provider many year identify medical need new safe cost-effective low dose intravenous ( IV ) iron administer frequently . Diafer® new low dose iron formulation base iron isomaltoside 1000 , dose restrict maximum 200 mg iron pr . injection . No test dose need Diafer® may administer push injection . The primary objective study monitor initiate Diafer® therapy administer accord hospital practice product label routine clinical practice HD patient CKD . The scientific rationale fulfil need systematic information/auditing applied practice include long term experience use IV iron HD setting . This information provide evidence base optimise treatment procedure .</detailed_description>
