	<detailed_description>Experimental Drug Profile . The active substance Fortelyzin Forteplase . It ` recombinant protein contain aminoacid sequence staphylokinase . It single chain molecula , consist 138 aminoacids , weight 15.5 kDa . When staphylokinase add human plasma contain fibrin clot , preferentially react plasmin clot surface , form plasmin-staphylokinase complex . This complex activate plasminogen trap thrombus . The plasmin-staphylokinase complex plasmin bound fibrin protect inhibition alpha2-antiplasmin . Once liberated clot ( generate plasma ) , however , rapidly inhibit alpha2-antiplasmin . This selectivity action confines process plasminogen activation thrombus , prevent excessive plasmin generation , alpha2-antiplasmin depletion , fibrinogen degradation plasma . In rabbit anti forteplase antibody produce . It achieve replacement amino acid immunogenic epitop molecule staphylokinase . Blood fibrinogen decrease i.v . injection Fortelyzin le 10 % within first 24 hour . Angiographic data suggest restoration coronary blood flow appear 80 % patient STEMI i.v . injection Fortelyzin . Risk/benifit trail participant . Expected benefit normalisation blood supply ischemic myocardium . It allow preserve normal heart function avoid heart failure development . The frequent advers reaction Fortelyzin possibilty bleeding . It possible occurence internal bleeding due peptic ulcer , erosion esophagus , haemorrhoid , vein esophagus . Thorough collection patient data follow drug instruction allow dicrease risk bleeding . The benefit use fibrinolytics patient STEMI suppose high risk bleeding . The reperfusion arrhythmia may occur careful ECG monitiring require . Main goal study - prove efficacy single-bolus intravenous injection recombinant nonimmunogenic staphylokinase ( Fortelyzin ) comparison single-bolus tenecteplase ( Metalyse ) patient ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction - prove safety ass possible adverse event single-bolus intravenous injection recombinant nonimmunogenic staphylokinase ( Fortelyzin ) comparison single-bolus tenecteplase ( Metalyse ) patient ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction Study Design . All eligible patient randomize two equal group administration recombinant nonimmunogenic staphylokinase ( Fortelyzin ) tenecteplase ( Metalyse ) use `` envelope method '' randomization . It open-lable study . Each agent administer longer 12 hour symptoms onset . Experimental comparative agent administer prescribed instruction . All randomized patient receive double anti-platelet therapy anticoagulant therapy : Enoxaparin &lt; 75 year : - 30 mg intravenous bolus - Subcutaneous injection 1.0 mg/kg every 12 hour hospital discharge maximum 4 day ; first injection give within 15 min bolus - For first two subcutaneous injection , maximum 100 mg per injection exceed ≥ 75 year : - No bolus ; Subcutaneous injection 0.75 mg/kg every 12 hour hospital discharge maximum 4 day ; first injection give immediately . - For first two subcutaneous injection , maximum 75 mg per injection exceed . For patient age creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min , subcutaneous injection 1.0 mg/kg give interval 24 hour . Clopidogrel &lt; 75 year : - 300 mg per o load dose - 75 mg per os daily maintenance dose ≥ 75 year : - No load dose ; 75 mg per o immediately randomization - 75 mg per os daily ( maintenance dose ) Acetylsalicylic acid expect administer routinely patient dose 250 mg per o fibrinolysis 75 - 325 mg per os daily . Patients receive enoxaparin pre-hospital setting administer different type heparin prior catheterisation ( vice versa ) . If heparin use pre-hospital set early in-hospital period , subsequent treatment switch enoxaparin prior catheterisation . Prior catheterisation dose 0.3 mg/kg intravenous enoxaparin give patient unless last subcutaneous dose enoxaparin give within previous 8 hr . Catheterisation - If ST-segment resolution ≥ 50 % qualify lead ( maximum initial ST-segment elevation baseline ECG ) 90 min , diagnostic coronary angiography ( follow PCI +/- stenting , indicate ) perform within 3-24 hour administration fibrinolytic agent . This consider planned catheterisation accord protocol - If ST-segment resolution &lt; 50 % relative ST-segment elevation qualify lead baseline , irrespective presence absence clinical symptom , rescue coronary intervention perform promptly . - If following indication require coronary intervention ( irrespective previous ST-segment resolution ) , urgent coronary intervention indicate time : - haemodynamic instability ( presence follow require inotropic support : sustain hypotension , cardiogenic shock , congestive heart failure ) - refractory ventricular arrhythmia require cardioversion pharmacological treatment - worsening ischaemia - progressive sustain ST-segment elevation , judgement investigator , require immediate coronary intervention . Duration follow-up 30 day since randomization Observation plan There six visit clinical trail schedule . First . In admission clinical center longer 12 hour symptom onset : - patient meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion patient inform consent sign accord protocol - evaluation medical history physical examination - 12-lead ECG - confirmation STEMI - blood analysis ( include troponin , CK-MB , INR , APPT , fibrinogen ) - urine analisis - correction therapy ( double anti-platelet therapy , enoxaparin ) - randomization - intravenous injection Fortelyzin Metalyse accord instruction - ECG criterion reperfusion assessment ( 90 min ) - PCI within 3-24 hour fibrinolysis Second ( 24 hour ) , Third ( 72 hour ) , Fourth ( 7 day ) , Fifth ( 14 day discharge ) - physical examination - 12-lead ECG - blood analysis ( include troponin , CK-MB , INR , APPT , fibrinogen ) - urine analysis - correction therapy nececcary - monitoring adverse event bleed Sixth ( 30 day ) - monitoring adverse event bleed - assessment end point Adverse event ( AE ) . All serious AEs relate study treatment ( recombinant nonimmunogenic staphylokinase , tenecteplase , enoxaparin , acetylsalicylic acid , clopidogrel , catheterisation/PCI ) report serious adverse event ( SAE ) page well AE page CRF . All SAE neither relate study treatment 'list STEMI relate event ' report SAE page well AE page CRF . All SAEs relate study treatment , 'list STEMI-related event ' record AE page CRF . Only serious AEs ( SAEs ) serious/non-serious bleeds record CRF . Non-serious AEs bleeds record CRF . Detailed instruction - include flow chart - reporting adverse event provide Investigator Site File ( ISF ) . During screening/baseline , patient 's condition assess ; relevant change baseline note subsequently source data . Patients investigator require - accord procedure describe - report spontaneously SAEs bleeds well time onset , end intensity event . A carefully write record SAEs bleed kept investigator charge trial . Records must include data time onset , end time intensity event well treatment action require event outcome . All event , include persist trial completion must follow resolve sufficiently characterise . Worsening pre-existing condition - Expected fluctuation expect deterioration underlie disease record AE . Worsening disease study record AE one follow criterion meet . - Worsening disease meet criteria SAE . - Action take investigational drug , i.e . dose reduced treatment discontinue increase . - Treatment require ( concomitant medication add change ) . - The investigator believe patient show clear , unexpected deterioration baseline symptom . - The criterion apply record AEs result worsen pre-existing condition . Pre-existing condition record AEs meet criterion . Specifically , follow record AE : - Pre-existing condition present baseline , remain unchanged trial . - Expected fluctuation expect deterioration pre-existing condition . Vital Signs , ECG Laboratory test result qualify AE Changes safety test include blood pressure , pulse rate , ECG laboratory test record AEs , : - associate already report AE , symptom diagnosis - action take investigational drug , i.e . dose reduced treatment discontinue - treatment require ( concomitant medication add change ) An AE define untoward medical occurrence , include exacerbation pre-existing condition , patient clinical investigation receive pharmaceutical product . The event necessarily causal relationship treatment . All adverse event occur course clinical trial ( i.e. , sign informed consent onwards observational phase ) collect , document report sponsor investigator . A SAE define AE result death , immediately life-threatening , result persistent significant disability / incapacity , require prolongs patient hospitalisation , congenital anomaly / birth defect , deem serious reason represent significant hazard , comparable aforementioned criterion . All serious adverse event non-serious bleeds fully document appropriate CRFs . For adverse event , investigator provide onset , end , intensity , treatment require , outcome , seriousness action take investigational drug . The investigator determine relationship investigational drug AE define 'Adverse Event Reporting ' section Investigator Site File . The basis judge intensity AE well causal relationship investigational product AE describe . Intensity event - Mild : Awareness sign ( ) symptom ( ) is/are easily tolerate - Moderate : Enough discomfort cause interference usual activity - Severe : Incapacitating cause inability work perform usual activity</detailed_description>
