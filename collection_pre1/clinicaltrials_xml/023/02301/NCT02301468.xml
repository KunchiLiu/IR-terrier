	<detailed_description>Neck-shoulder pain common office worker characterize pain fatigue shoulder neck region . Usually , muscle around neck shoulder involve work-related neck-shoulder pain ( M. Trapezius , M. Levator Scapulae , M. Splenius Cervicis , M. Infraspinatus ) . Typically , sensitive spot often present muscle , define trigger point . In treatment trigger point dry needling ( DN ) technique ischemic compression ( IC ) technique often use , support increase scientific evidence . In dry needling ( DN ) technique thin ( acupuncture ) needle puncture directly trigger point aim generate `` local twitch response '' . These involuntary contraction muscle fiber cause muscle relaxation recover metabolism muscle . In ischemic compression ( IC ) technique , pressure apply slowly progressively trigger point ( upon skin ) . A randomized control trial conduct examine effectiveness DN versus IC trigger point neck shoulder region reduce pain improve functionality ( primary outcome measure ) investigate effectiveness DN versus IC muscle strength , mobility muscle tone ( secondary outcome measure ) . To comply scientific objective , 60 people recruit . The participant recruit within several business company . The participant people perform least 4 hour day office work least one full year . All participant get information inform consent information study . The subject randomly assign two group : one group treatment DN , another group treatment IC . All participant subject baseline assessment . The baseline assessment include assessment pain , functionality , muscle strength , mobility muscle tone . Twelve triggerpoints ( fix location ) localize pain assessment trigger point perform . The four painful trigger point ( point tolerate least pressure ) determine . The treatment DN IC perform 4 painful trigger point last four week total ( frequency one treatment/week ) . Two follow-up assessment take place . A first follow-up assessment provide one week post-intervention ( short-term effect ) , test perform . A second follow-up assessment do 3 month post-intervention ( long-term effect ) .</detailed_description>
