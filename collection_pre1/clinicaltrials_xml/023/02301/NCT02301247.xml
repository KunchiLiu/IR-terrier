	<detailed_description>There clear unmet need clinical care person Progressive MS - treatment memory dysfunction demonstrate efficacy person progressive disease . This despite fact cognitive impairment major contributor unemployment decrease functional status MS memory deficit major source disability . The investigator recent RCT 's demonstrated modified Story Memory Technique ( mSMT ) effective improve new learn memory individual MS , demonstrate efficacy across three realm function , objective behavior , brain functioning everyday life . This convincing data provide Class I evidence support efficacy mSMT improve new learn memory MS . However , treatment efficacy adequately test progressive MS population . This major limitation due fact progressive MS carry major cognitive difficulty , learn memory one common . The currently propose RCT address limitation . The investigator use methodologically vigorous research design provide Class I evidence support refute efficacy mSMT person progressive MS , outcome measure three mechanism : ( 1 ) traditional neuropsychological evaluation ( NPE ) ( 2 ) assessment global functioning ( AGF ) examine impact treatment daily activity ( 3 ) optional functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan . Both group undergo baseline , immediate follow-up , 3-month follow-up assessment Thus , current study objectively evaluate clinical utility mSMT improve new learn memory individual progressive MS document deficit area . This protocol previously utilized Relapsing-Remitting MS sample , yield exceptional outcome data . Pilot data small sample progressive MS patient promise . The investigator also increase generalizability real life application assessment technique assess outcome follow cognitive retrain global measure everyday life . Finally , long-term efficacy mSMT evaluate progressive MS inclusion 3-month follow-up assessment . Given absence treatment impair learning memory progressive patient , result present RCT significant impact symptom management quality life person Progressive MS .</detailed_description>
