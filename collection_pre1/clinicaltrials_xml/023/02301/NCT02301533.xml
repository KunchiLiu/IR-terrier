Our goal find intervention involve provider counsel support MSM peer improve ART adherence engagement care among Kenyan MSM . This study carry KEMRI clinic Mtwapa 70 MSM patient participant reside area , identify outreach test program Mtwapa . Six provider five peer train intervention also consent order collect data feedback help monitor study . Our intervention consist support train peer experience take ART enhance counsel provider aim motivate patient improve maintain health . In initial pilot test , implement intervention 10 MSM start ART first time . After needed revision research procedures train , next conduct small randomize controlled trial 60 MSM patient participant determine feasibility , acceptability , tolerability , safety , estimate initial effect size adherence intervention . The 60 patient participant randomize intervention standard counsel care , follow 6 month evaluate ART adherence retention care . Providers peer give feedback regular project meeting in-depth interview pilot test RCT . The work propose project carry 2 year , June 1 , 2014 May 31 , 2016 .</brief_summary>

Ten patient participant follow pilot test 3 month , monthly measurement ART adherence , baseline month 3 measurement adherence correlate , feedback participant staff intervention procedure . After fine-tuning intervention base pilot test , follow 60 MSM patient participant 6 month , monthly measurement ART adherence , baseline quarterly measurement adherence correlate , viral load test month 3 month 6 biomarker treatment success , feedback participant staff intervention procedure . Findings formative 2-year study provide qualitative data feasibility , acceptability , tolerability , safety , quantitative data preliminary effect size test intervention component fully power RCT include large , diverse sample MSM multiple sit sub-Saharan Africa .</detailed_description>
