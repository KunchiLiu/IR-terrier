	<brief_summary>This randomize controlled trial compare effect 10-day course per oral Metronidazole versus one-time rectal instillation anaerobically cultivate human intestinal microbiota treatment first occurrence clostridium difficile infection ( CDI ) . Recurrent CDI common standard antibiotic treatment . We hypothesize instillation healthy intestinal microbiota effective inducing durable cure Metronidazole primary CDI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Up one third patient clostridium difficile infection treat antibiotic experience recurrent relapsing symptom within week . Even subsequent antibiotic treatment , multiple recurrences/relapses frequent . Fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) show significantly effective cure recurrent CDI repeat antibiotic treatment . In current guideline , FMT propose treatment option multiple recurrences/relapses CDI . The rationale reserve transplantation donor feces recurrent difficult case CDI possible risk pathogen transmittance cumbersome costly process find donor screen communicable disease . The effect FMT recurrent CDI , however , suggest therapy may effective antibiotic induce durable cure also primary CDI . We aim use anaerobically cultivate human intestinal microbiota ( ACHIM ) extensively test pathogen , donor screen communicable disease , avoid need case-by-case donor screening . The term Intestinal Microbiota Therapy ( IMT ) use describe ACHIM treatment . Patients first occurrence CDI define diarrhea , define World Health Organization , positive stool test Clostridium difficile toxin A B randomize 1:1 either 10-day course Metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d . rectal instillation 60 ml ACHIM suspension . Patients contact day 4 unblinded study investigator day 35 70 blind study investigator evaluate treatment effect . In addition , patient register frequency bowel movement day 1-4 , 7 , 14 21 . In case clinical deterioration , appropriate measure undertake accord current guideline . A second instillation ACHIM suspension consider day 4 absence clinical improvement . The primary endpoint rate primary cure CDI sign relapse/recurrence within 70 day , persistent diarrhea could explain cause three consecutive negative stool test C. difficile toxin A B . Treatment failure define persistent diarrhea positive stool test C. difficile toxin A B. Relapsing recurrent CDI define diarrhea positive stool test C. difficile toxin within 70 day treatment initiation initial resolution diarrhea . Preliminary sample size estimate hypothesis primary cure rate without recurrence within 70 day 75 % Metronidazole vs. 87.5 % IMT . An interim analysis plan inclusion first 40 patient guide final sample size estimation . Patients recruit six hospital South-East Norway .</detailed_description>
