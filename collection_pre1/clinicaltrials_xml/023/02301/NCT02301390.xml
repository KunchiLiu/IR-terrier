	<brief_title>INTERVENE : Indian Trial Endocardial Ventricular Substrate Ablation Prevent Recurrent VT Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) account approximately 50 % cardiac death , represent estimate annual incidence range 250,000 350,000 case United States . The pathophysiologic mechanism sudden death majority patient think ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) relate coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , degenerate ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) . Patients survive initial episode VT/VF prone extremely high incidence recurrent life-threatening event ( ~25 % one year ) . Even patient without history VT/VF , presence CAD leave ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction confers two-year mortality rate 22 % . If VT inducible electrophysiological testing , two-year mortality ~30 % . The pathogenesis VT set CAD reentry area scar myocardium . After MI , tissue broadly divide three zone : dense scar , surround live myocardial tissue , intervene border zone . After myocardial infarction ( MI ) , `` border zone '' dense scar live tissue contain electrically-active live myocardial fibril intersperse area infarcted , fibrotic tissue—setting stage local reentrant circuit result VT . The use antiarrhythmic medication ( AADs ) suppress occurrence/recurrence VT/VF high-risk patient mostly disappoint . In large clinical trial , AADs prove inefficacious , actually increase mortality . The one potential exception appear Amiodarone : one study suggest mortality benefit ( GESICA ) , others suggest Amiodarone provide significant antiarrhythmic benefit without change mortality ( EMIAT , CAMIAT , SCD-HeFT ) . However , even use Amiodarone plague multiple organ toxicity , range pulmonary fibrosis hepatitis , thyroid dysfunction . An important alternative questionably efficacious antiarrhythmic implantable cardio-defibrillator ( ICD ) , accurately effectively detect terminate VT/VF , result significant mortality benefit primary secondary prevention sudden cardiac death . Yet , despite beneficial result , ICD implantation consider cure VT . In addition , common patient experience painful high-voltage shock secondary recurrent ventricular arrhythmia , lose consciousness prior delivery therapy . Moreover , considerable cost ICDs severely limit availability develop world—where public and/or private health insurance system rudimentary best , incidence coronary artery disease four time higher develop world—highlighting urgency establish alternative therapy post-MI patient ventricular arrhythmia accessibly effective . One option may catheter ablation ventricular arrhythmia . It well describe hemodynamically-stable VT circuit , careful ventricular mapping identify site critical maintenance give circuit , follow discrete application catheter-based radiofrequency ( RF ) energy , effectively eliminate VT . This strategy mock surgical approach use extensively since late 1970s modification arrhythmogenic substrate patient chronic myocardial infarction . Since location reentrant circuit often locate junction normal scarred myocardium , two effective general strategy develop time : ) subendocardial resection—involving surgical removal subendocardial layer contain arrhythmogenic substrate border zone , b ) encircle endocardial ventriculotomy—consisting placement circumferential surgical lesion border zone , presumably , interrupt potential VT circuit . When perform experienced center , long-term freedom malignant VT/VF surgery &gt; 90 % . However , significant mortality ( 3-14 % ) morbidity associate invasive procedure curtail use general practice . The less invasive , catheter approach substrate modification rely electroanatomical map system create high fidelity representation endocardium , allow reconstruction electronic manipulation endocardial cast ventricular chamber carefully delineate normal abnormal tissue . This base observation normal sinus rhythm , distinguish characteristic endocardial electrogram ( EGM ) normal abnormal tissue : abnormal tissue manifest low voltage amplitude , prolong EGM duration , presence late fractionate potential . Marchlinski colleague report seminal study use substrate-mapping strategy , catheter-based RF ablation lesion direct linear fashion effective control scar-related drug-refractory unstable VT . Furthermore , use high-density electroanatomical mapping 1 ) strategy utilized localize arrhythmogenic substrate majority patient history myocardial infarction sustain ventricular tachyarrhythmia 's , 2 ) RF ablation use irrigated-tip ablation catheter effectively safely use modify arrhythmogenic substrate render VT non-inducible even presence multiple VT morphology . The favorable result non-randomized report prompt initiation SMASH-VT ( Substrate Mapping &amp; Ablation Sinus Rhythm Halt Ventricular Tachycardia Trial ) ; prospective randomize clinical trial objectively assess clinical utility substrate ablation scar-related VT . This trial randomized-controlled trial examine role substrate mapping RF ablation primary prevention ICD shock patient present clinically life-threatening VT/VF . That , patient history MI , survive episode VT/VF high-risk recurrent VT thus treat ICDs ( essence , patient meet AVID/CIDS/CASH criterion ) . In normal clinical practice , patient routinely treat adjuvant medication proarrhythmic potential side effect . In addition ICD routine clinical care , patient additionally randomize SMASH-VT substrate-based catheter ablation . This catheter ablation group underwent electroanatomic mapping delineate endocardial infarct margin ( CARTO , Biosense-Webster , Inc. ) . Substrate modification perform target exit site induce VTs and/or late potential within scar use standard irrigated radiofrequency ablation catheter . As publish late 2007 ( Reddy et al , NEJM , 357:2657 ) , 30-day post-ablation mortality zero , significant change ventricular function functional class follow . During average follow-up 22.5±5.5 month , appropriate defibrillator therapy ( anti-tachycardia pacing shock ) occur 21 control ( 33 % ) 8 ablation ( 12 % ) patient ( p=0.007 log rank test ) . Of , appropriate defibrillator shock alone occur 20 control ( 31 % ) 6 ablation ( 9 % ) patient ( p=0.003 ) . Mortality increase ablation arm ( control 17 % , ablation 9 % ; p=0.29 ) ; indeed , trend decrease mortality ablation arm . Thus , SMASH-VT study reveal several important point : 1 ) adjuvant substrate base catheter ablation feasible patient population , 2 ) use saline-irrigated RF ablation catheter ablation strategy safe , 3 ) strategy decrease subsequent ICD therapy post-myocardial infarction patient receive defibrillator secondary prevention sudden death . The favorable result SMASH-VT , combine considerable technical scientific improvement catheter ablation scar-related VT , also raise possibility therapeutic benefit ablation may extrapolate similar patient develop world , MI survive ventricular arrhythmic event , unable afford ICD . This particular importance patient typically treat chronic Amiodarone therapy—a strategy unestablished mortality benefit significant side effect . The investigator therefore propose randomized clinical trial , India—a nation population 1.2 billion—will serve representative model develop world . The study evaluate safety efficacy adjunctive catheter ablation post-myocardial infarction patient additionally survive ventricular arrhythmic event , would initiate chronic Amiodarone therapy inability afford ICD therapy . Patients therefore randomized even proportion either ) control group , receive chronic Amiodarone therapy , study group , undergo catheter ablation VT addition chronic Amiodarone therapy .</detailed_description>
