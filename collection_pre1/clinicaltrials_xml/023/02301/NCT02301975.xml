	<brief_summary>This study randomize , double-blind , double-dummy , parallel group , multicenter , non-inferiority study . The study enroll adult adolescent asthmatic subject currently receive mid dose inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) plus long-acting beta2-agonist ( LABA ) ( equivalent fluticasone propionate [ FP ] /salmeterol 250/50 microgram [ mcg ] twice daily [ BD ] ) , either via fix dose combination product separate inhaler . The study consist LABA washout period 5 day run-in period 4 week , follow treatment period 24 week , follow contact period one week . The total duration study 30 week . Approximately 1461 subject randomize one follow three treatment ( 487 per treatment ) : fluticasone furoate ( FF ) /vilanterol ( VI ) 100/25 mcg daily ( OD ) evening ( PM ) via ELLIPTA™ inhaler plus placebo BD via ACCUHALER™/DISKUS™ ; FP/salmeterol 250/50 mcg BD via ACCUHALER/DISKUS inhaler plus placebo OD ( PM ) via ELLIPTA inhaler ; FP 250 mcg BD via ACCUHALER/DISKUS inhaler plus placebo OD ( PM ) via ELLIPTA inhaler . In addition , subject supply albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol use need treat acute asthma symptom . This study determine FF/VI 100/25 mcg OD via ELLIPTA inhaler non-inferior FP/salmeterol 250/50 mcg BD via ACCUHALER/DISKUS inhaler adult adolescent asthmatic subject already adequately control twice-daily ICS/LABA .
