	<brief_summary>The purpose study view normal breast tissue look like MRI mammogram help determine may affect risk develop breast cancer . The investigator also compare information collect questionnaire medical record help good understand may affect risk develop breast cancer . If saliva tissue sample collect future use , information enable u study genetic risk factor well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Background Parenchymal Enhancement Risk Factor Breast Cancer : The IMAGINg Epidemiology ( IMAGINE ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proposed Study Methods Pertaining Population , Eligibility Recruitment In multi-center hospital-based case-control study , case woman diagnose incident breast cancer undergone undergo bilateral breast MRI contrast ass extent disease . The cancer-free control woman high-risk breast cancer undergo bilateral breast MRI contrast screening . The MRI collect study may post-biopsy post-surgery ( unilateral lumpectomy/mastectomy ) , prior bilateral mastectomy , radiation , hormonal , and/or chemotherapy . Study participant also need bilateral mammogram available study site within 24 month prior , 24 month study MRI ( long prior surgery , radiation , hormonal , and/or chemotherapy ) , include secondary aim analysis . The MRI/mammogram select study need conduct recruitment site , digital image need accessible patient medical record site . Questionnaire data , optional saliva sample , MRIs , mammogram , medical record collect 27 month period woman three NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center ( MSK , Penn , Utah ) . Each site demonstrate experience recruitment , patient interview collection MRIs mammogram .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria Breast Cancer Cases ( invasive ) Women follow characteristic MRI eligible invasive case : 1. diagnose invasive unilateral breast cancer 1/1/2010 ; 2. pretreatment ( prior bilateral mastectomy , radiation , hormonal , and/or chemotherapy ) bilateral breast MRI contrast available study site ; 3. ≥ 21 &lt; 70 year old time diagnosis ; 4. intact contralateral breast time study MRI . Eligibility Criteria Breast Cancer Cases ( noninvasive ) Women follow characteristic MRI eligible noninvasive case : diagnosed unilateral ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) preferably 1/1/2013 ; 2 ) pretreatment ( prior bilateral mastectomy , radiation , hormonal , and/or chemotherapy ) bilateral breast MRI contrast available study site ; 3 ) ≥ 21 &lt; 70 year old time diagnosis ; 4 ) intact contralateral breast . The contralateral breast need intact unaffected invasive carcinoma and/or DCIS MRI read do breast without cancer . Women history previous cancer diagnosis exclude treatment may receive cancer might affect MRI reading . Eligibility Criteria Controls Controls woman determine high risk develop breast cancer ( i.e. , lifetime risk ≥20 % Controls must meet following criterion : 1. bilateral breast MRI screen contrast available study site ; 2. ≥ 21 &lt; 70 year old time MRI ; 3. negative breast MRI screen . For either case control prior study MRI date : 1. unable speak read English ; 2. history prophylactic mastectomy ; 3. history prepectoral breast implant either breast ( subpectoral acceptable ) ; 4. history breast reduction surgery ; 5. currently take , previous 3 month : hormonal medication Tamoxifen ( Nolvadex ) , Raloxifene ( Evista ) , aromatase inhibitor ( Anastrozole/Arimidex , Letrozole/Femara , and/or Exemestane/Aromasin ) ; and/or postmenopausal hormonal therapy ( PHT ) medication ; and/or hormonal medication fertility treatment ; [ Note : Women INELIGIBLE report take pill orally , use patch ring , even intermittently use . Women ELIGIBLE report take hormone replacement therapy form cream , suppository ( intravaginal ) , soybased , natural product . ] 6. currently , precede 6 month , pregnant breast feeding ; 7. history previous cancer include DCIS [ Note : Women ELIGIBLE diagnose non melanoma skin cancer lobular carcinoma situ ( LCIS ) and/or cervical cancer situ ] . Notes : Women recently diagnose DCIS within study period categorize noninvasive case ( preferable prospective recruitment ) . Only one breast may affect recent diagnosis invasive carcinoma and/or DCIS .</criteria>
