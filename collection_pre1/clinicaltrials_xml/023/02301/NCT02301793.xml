Most importantly , highly interactive product ( CONTEMPORARY ) STUDY DESIGN AND ANALYTIC PLAN - Research hypotheses - Primary : Nurse participant receive either intervention improve administration prescribe VTE prophylaxis evidence decrease frequency non-administered dos VTE prophylaxis , compare frequency baseline . - Secondary : Nurse participant receive contemporary education format large decrease frequency miss dos VTE prophylaxis compare participate traditional education format . - Study Design - Cluster Randomized Trial 21 floor , block randomize floor type ( medicine [ n=11 ] vs. surgery [ n=10 ] ) ( ICU [ n=5 ] vs. non-ICU [ n=16 ] ) All nurse floor assign education type mitigate issue relate contamination nurse discuss education colleague - Primary Outcome measure : Proportion non-administered dos pharmacological VTE prophylaxis ( dose level ) - Secondary Outcome Measures : - Proportion dos document missed due patient refusal ( dose level ) - Proportion patient VTE ( patient level ) - Proportion patient Deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT ) ( patient level ) - Proportion patient Pulmonary Embolism ( PE ) ( patient level ) - Analytic method - Primary analysis - Intention-to-treat ( include nurse assign , whether complete education ) Is difference unit allocate either intervention compare outcome measure baseline measure ? Is difference compare receive contemporary education format vs. traditional education format ? - Secondary analysis - Per protocol ( include nurse complete education ) Do nurse receive education perform well ( improved administration prescribe VTE prophylaxis ) ?
