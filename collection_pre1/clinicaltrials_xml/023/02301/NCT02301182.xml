	<brief_title>Comparison Functional Results ADM X3-MoP Cup ( Stryker ) CoC Cup ( Zimmer ) Young Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With Metal-on-Metal ( MoM ) articulation leave marked THA bearing choice young patient currently debate overall choice stand CoC MoP . New HXLPE wear-resistant safe clinical HXLPE wear ( RSA ) hardly exceed wear measured retrieval CoC implant . For CoC articulation stripe wear edge loading report problem lead increase wear examined retrieval component CoC wear dependent component position . Although risk small , CoC bearing still risk fracture , functional squeak complication adversely affect quality life 1 % CoC THA patient . Dual mobility MoP cup design reduce hip dislocation old patient treat THA medial hip fracture . The concept provide good stability mobility may also optimal solution younger active patient ; however , dual mobility MoP previously document use young patient . The anatomical dual mobility ( ADM ) cup design ( Stryker ) soft tissue sparing ( iliopsoas tendon ) potentially lead less groin-pain squeaking concern . It currently unknown outer-articulation dual mobility PE liner keep move time could impinge joint capsule undesirable position result unwanted edge load high wear-rates . Metal ion produce even MoP bearing even though dual-articulation MoP bearing ( 90 % ) motion believe occur head liner ( ceramic-polyenthylene ) , metal ion level may higher expect MoP hip ( large poly contact metal shell ) , expectedly metal ion CoC THA .</detailed_description>
