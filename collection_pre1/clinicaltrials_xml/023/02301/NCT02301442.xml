	<brief_title>Step Up : An Exercise Behaviour Change Programme People With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background study aim Exercise consistently yield short-term , positive effect health outcome people multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . However , effect maintain long-term . Behaviour change intervention aim promote long-term positive lifestyle change . This study , namely , `` Step Up '' compare effect exercise plus Social Cognitive Theory ( SCT ) -based behaviour change intervention exercise plus control education intervention walk mobility among people MS. Our hypothesis exercise SCT-based intervention achieve significantly improvement walk mobility control group post-intervention ( 12 week ) improvement maintain 24- 36- week follow . 2 . What study involve ? Exercise plus contact control education intervention The control group receive exercise didactic control education component . The exercise intervention include aerobic strengthen component deliver physiotherapist . The aim exercise component progressively increase intensity aerobic strengthening activity enable participant reach recently publish MS exercise guideline ( Latimer- Cheung et al 2013 ) . The aerobic activity walking , intensity monitor use step rate measure use Yamax digiwalker pedometer* ( provided participant ) exercise log document duration walk exercise number step take . It widely accept 100 step per minute equates three MET moderate intensity physically active ( PA ) among people MS ( Agiovlasitis Motl 2014 ) . Participants begin 10 minute walk twice weekly rate 100 steps/minute increase incrementally 5 minute interval 5 week reach guideline 30 minute twice weekly ( Latimer-Cheung et al 2013 ) . The strengthen programme base community-based exercise programme evaluate previously ( Garrett et al 2013 ) consist 10 exercise target major muscle group upper low extremity use elastic resistance band . Participants begin one set 10-15 repetition gradually increase number set , repetition level resistance meet target two set exercise twice weekly sufficient resistance fail 12th repetition . Over 10-week programme participant attend group exercise class six occasion , supplement telephone coach call week without class ( intervention week 4 , 6 , 7 9 ) . These telephone call consist direct question frequency , intensity , type duration exercise complete whether experienced adverse event relapse . After group exercise class control group receive education session topic unrelated physical activity behaviour , e.g . diet , vitamin D , sleep , temperature hydration , immunisation vaccination . Exercise plus SCT-based intervention The exercise plus SCT-based intervention group receive exercise intervention control group ( describe previous section ) .This group also receive behaviour change intervention base principle SCT . The SCT-based education session deliver exercise session physiotherapist incorporate principle element SCT include self-efficacy , outcome expectation , impediment goal-setting . Beyond provide presentation note , individual reflection write exercise , group discussion principle SCT , provide on-going feedback aspect PA behaviour , program include video file people MS discuss PA behaviour experience initiate maintain physically-active lifestyle . On week participant attend group session , receive telephone coach call physiotherapist . These coach call consist guide conversation consider component SCT deliver previous session revision component . 4 . What possible benefit risk participate ? Benefits participant include access free physiotherapy-led exercise programme , benefit improve aerobic capacity , mobility , fatigue , mood , muscle strength anticipate . The education session may also help participant keep benefit longer . The investigator envisage adverse effect intervention . 5 . Where study run ? This study organise Clinical Therapies , University Limerick . 6 . When study start long expect run ? This study start September 2014 anticipate data collection end March 2016 . Participants recruit June 2015 . 7. Who fund study ? The Irish Health Research Board , Health Research Award Grant funding study . 8. Who main contact ?
