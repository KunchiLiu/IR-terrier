	<brief_summary>The majority melanoma vaccine test date antigen-specific vaccine target melanoma-specific associate antigen utilize variety delivery system immune-adjuvants . As opposed test `` shelf '' vaccine might able treat subset patient , approach personalize patient applicable patient . Our vaccine approach consist harness potent antigen present cell body - dendritic cell ( DC ) - together full repertoire tumor antigens individual 's cancer . We conduct phase I II study use autologous DC-tumor cell fusion technique simplify DC-tumor cell lysate vaccine . The autologous tumor lysate ( TL ) load yeast cell wall particle ( YCWP ) naturally efficiently take patient 's DC . These autologous tumor lysate , particle-loaded , DC ( TLPLDC ) inject intradermally ( ID ) monthly x 3 follow booster 6 , 12 , 18 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stage III Stage IV ( resect ) melanoma patient identify prior definitive surgery screen inclusion/exclusion criterion . Eligible patient counsel consented tissue procurement . Enrolled patient disease surgically resect portion ( approximately 1mg ) melanoma sterilely frozen operating room provide freezing vial storage tube . This tissue ship liquid nitrogen shipper FedEx central facility Greenville , SC store frozen vaccine preparation . If patient render disease-free , consider screen failure study . If melanoma resect multiple location ( primary node , two different metastatic site ) , sample would prefer mandatory . As indicated SoC per National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline determine treat team , patient receive systemic therapy ( chemotherapy IFN-α ) and/or radiation therapy , vaccination begin SoC therapy complete . Once SoC therapy complete patient deem clinically disease-free , consented treatment randomize . Once consent , 120 mL blood collect patient sent central facility DC isolation preparation . Vaccines prepare produce TL freeze/thaw cycling load pre-prepared YCWP . The TL-loaded YCWP introduce DC phagocytosis thus create TLPLDC vaccine frozen single dose vial . Each vial contain 1 x 106 TLPLDC label patient 's unique study number . Based randomization , autologous TLPLDC ( active vaccine ) unload YCWP + autologous DC ( control ) send back site blind fashion . Regardless assign group , site receive 6 single dose vial inject intradermal monthly x 3 follow booster 6 , 12 , 18 month lymph node drain area ( preferably anterior thigh ) . Patients must begin vaccination 3 week 3 month completion ( SoC ) . Frozen tumor maintain active vaccine patient include control patient . The latter offer active vaccine time recurrence crossover fashion . Additionally , control patient recur offer active vaccine completion trial . Safety data collect local systemic toxicity grade report per Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v4.03 . Disease-free status monitor per SoC outline NCCN . Suspected recurrence document biopsy pathologic confirmation . Time recurrence base date randomization time confirm recurrence . Blood ( 50 mL ) collect patient prior inoculation 24 month enrollment total 7 time point total 350 mL blood 2 year . The collected blood send central facility immunologic test T-cell response .</detailed_description>
