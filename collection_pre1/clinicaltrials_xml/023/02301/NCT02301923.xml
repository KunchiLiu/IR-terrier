	<brief_title>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) Compliance Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) frequent disease affect 4 % male population 2 % female population , well know repercussion quality life ( daytime drowsiness , concentration issue , increase motor vehicle accident , etc ) cardiovascular risk ( increase risk stroke , hypertension , diabetes , CAD , etc. ) . It cause intermittent relaxation throat muscle sleep , thus block airway lead snore apnea . Treatment involve diet sport , sleep hygiene technique , mandibular advancement device . But CPAP ( continuous positive airway pressure ) device remain first line therapy OSA . It effective reduce apnea-hypopnea ( AHI ) oxygen desaturation index ( ODI ) , poor compliance often notice , 46 % patient still use device 6 month . Despite numerous study subject , include large number patient ( &gt; 150 ) long follow time ( &gt; 1 year ) , reach conclusive evidence concern factor influence CPAP compliance . In order determine factor , investigator take account approximately 450 patient timeframe 5 year use CPAP device course disorder , establish Kaplan-Meyer estimation survival function . The investigator use anthropometry ( BMI , neck circumference , sex , age , etc . ) , polysomnography ( Epworth score , AHI , ODI , sleep efficiency , etc . ) CPAP ( pressure , leak , etc . ) data Cox regression order determine factor influence compliance patient . The result allow u establish average compliance patient CPAP therapy , well reason lead termination , factor predict decreased compliance consequence stop treatment . This allow u set multiple method improve follow-up patient predict recalcitrant CPAP therapy .</detailed_description>
