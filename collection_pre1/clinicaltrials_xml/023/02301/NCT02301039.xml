	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year ( Age ≥ 12 year patient bone sarcomas ) . Histologically confirm diagnosis unresectable , recurrent , and/or metastatic high grade softtissue bone sarcoma one follow subtypes : soft tissue sarcoma ( leiomyosarcoma , poorly differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma , high grade pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma/MFH synovial sarcoma ) , bone sarcoma ( Ewing sarcoma , osteosarcoma , chondrosarcoma [ dedifferentiate mesenchymal ] ) . ECOG Performance Status 0 1 . At least one site measurable disease CT/MRI scan define RECIST 1.1 . Baseline image must perform within 30 day dose . At least one site accessible disease pre posttreatment core biopsy least 20 patient per arm expansion cohort . Patients may receive 13 prior systemic therapy metastatic setting . Adequate organ function within 14 day dose Must willing provide available archival tissue PDL1 testing . Written , voluntary inform consent . Fertile men woman childbearing potential must agree use effective method birth control provide sign consent 120 day last study drug administration . Women childbearing potential include premenopausal woman woman within first 2 year onset menopause . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ≤ 72 hour prior Day 1 study . Effective method birth control include : surgically sterile , barrier device ( condom , diaphragm ) , contraceptive coil , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , abstinence . Life expectancy &gt; 12 week . Patients central nervous system disease eligible enrollment receive prior radiotherapy surgery sit CNS metastatic disease without evidence clinical progression least 4 week prior screen , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , steroid least 7 day first dose pembrolizumab . Prior systemic therapy target PD1 : PDL1 axis . Patients curable conventional multidisciplinary management . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical disease opinion investigator could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol . Patients receive wide field radiotherapy ≤ 4 week limited field radiation palliation &lt; 2 week prior screen recover adequately side effect therapy . Patients active infection require therapy . Patients know positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) , active Hepatitis B ( HBsAg reactive ) , Hepatitis C ( HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) ; patient negative Hepatitis C antibody test may need RNA test . Patients know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Patients receive systemic anticancer treatment prior first dose study drug within follow time frame : Patients active autoimmune disease document history autoimmune disease syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent . Patients vitiligo resolve childhood asthma/atopy would exception rule . Patients require inhaled steroid local steroid injection would exclude study . Patients hypothyroidism autoimmune disease stable hormone replacement exclude study . Women pregnant nursing/breastfeeding . Known hypersensitivity pembrolizumab another mAb . Has history ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid current pneumonitis . Patients untreated central nervous system disease . Patients control treated CNS lesion undergo surgery stereotactic radiosurgery stable 4 week eligible . Inability comply protocol require procedure . Patients medical condition require chronic systemic corticosteroid therapy require form immunosuppressive medication . However , patient use physiologic replacement dose hydrocortisone , equivalent , consider eligible study : 20 mg hydrocortisone ( 5 mg prednisone ) morning 10 mg hydrocortisone ( 2.5 mg prednisone ) evening . Patients risk factor bowel obstruction bowel perforation ( example include limited history acute diverticulitis , intraabdominal abscess , abdominal carcinomatosis ) . Patients receive live vaccine within 30 day prior first dose trial treatment .</criteria>
