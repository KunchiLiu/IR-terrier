	<brief_summary>Background : Repeated episode bleed gastrointestinal vascular malformation refractory endoscopic surgical therapy often pose major therapeutic challenge . Methods : The investigator perform randomize , double blind , placebo control study thalidomide retreatment therapy recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due vascular malformation . Patients failure first course treatment thalidomide randomly group , prescribed second four-month course regimen 25 mg thalidomide placebo orally four time daily . All patient monitor least one year . The primary end point define patient whose rebleeds decrease baseline ≥ 50 % 12 month cessation bleeding . Rebleeding define base positive fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) ( monoclonal colloidal gold color technology ) visit treatment . Secondary outcome include participant dependent blood transfusion change baseline transfuse packed red cell unit , bleed episode , hemoglobin level 12 month . Statistical significance define P &lt; 0.05 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retreatment Its Efficiency Thalidomide Vascular Malformation Patients With Failure First Course Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol Description : This exploratory , randomize , double blind , placebo control study thalidomide retreatment patient failure first course thalidomide treatment recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding vascular malformation . Informed consent take subject Institute Ethics Committee approve study protocol . All procedure accordance Declaration Helsinki . The study support pharmaceutical funding . Study design Intervention : From Dec. 2014 Nov. 2015 , patient failure first course thalidomide treatment repeat least four episode chronic gastrointestinal bleeding year due vascular malformation identify oesophagogastroduodenoscopy , capsule endoscope double-balloon endoscope enrol ( accord enrollment criterion ) . The patient randomly assign receive second four-month course 25 mg thalidomide placebo daily time 6 a.m.,12 noon,6 p.m. 10 p.m. , respectively . Randomization perform proc plan procedure Statistical Analysis System ( SAS ) , use method randomly permute block 4 . Within block , number patient allocate two treatment equal . Each patient meet inclusion criterion consecutively assign random number chronological order , allocate one treatment group . In case adverse event , study medication temporarily permanently discontinue base subject inclination toxicity intolerance . Concomitant therapy , blood transfusion symptomatic treatment like iron supplementation , perform group necessary four-month treatment subsequent follow-up period . Blood transfusion indicate record hemoglobin ( Hb ) level reach &lt; 7.0 g/dl . Red-cell transfusion administer accord patient Hb level follow : 2 unit administer 6.1 g/dl ≥ Hb ≤ 7.0 g/dl , 3 unit 5.1 g/dl ≥ Hb ≤ 6.0 g/dl , 4 unit Hb &lt; 5.0 g/dl . Iron provide patient 7.0 g/dl ≥ Hb ≤ 11.0 g/dl . After four-month treatment course , patient discontinue study medication except case symptomatic treatment necessary describe . Assessment response adverse event : The primary end point define patient whose rebleeds decrease baseline ≥ 50 % 12 month cessation bleeding . Rebleeding define base positive fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) ( monoclonal colloidal gold color technology ) visit treatment . Secondary outcome include participant dependent blood transfusion change baseline transfuse packed red cell unit , bleed episode , hemoglobin level 12 month . Adverse event include unfavorable change health , include abnormal laboratory finding , study follow-up period . Evaluation Patients Follow-up : - Certified research nurse collect information demographic medical social history patient enrol study . - After screen baseline evaluation , patient closely monitored hospital least one week . They follow twice monthly four-mouth course treatment month thereafter . - Clinical follow-up perform qualified doctor . At visit , bleeding-related parameter ( number duration ) collect , physical examination perform laboratory value obtain FOBT , complete blood count , serum chemistry , hepatic renal function . Neuropathy adverse event also assess . - Patients advise refrain non-prescribed medicine , especially rebleeding-related medication aspirin , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , anti-platelet drug , anticoagulant , Chinese medication ( salicylate ) , gingko , Echinacea . Statistical Analysis : To knowledge , similar study concern efficiency thalidomide retreatment previously perform , investigator thus unable refer publish study determine sample . According publish study , response iron-control group thalidomide group reach 3.7 % 71.4 % . And preliminary study ( unpublished ) , response thalidomide retreatment reach 66.7 % . For study , investigator estimate primary outcome ( proportion subject whose number yearly bleeds decrease ≥ 50 % ) occur 3.7 % placebo group 66.7 % thalidomide retreatment group patient . An equally divided sample 9 subject deem sufficient detect primary end point , type I error ( two-sided ) 5 % power 90 % . Assuming 10 % volunteer attrition rate follow-up , investigator establish target sample size 10 per group ( calculate PASS 11 ) . To ensure adequate power later stratify analysis , sample size approximately increase 15 group . Analyses response adverse event perform registered patient accord intention-to-treat principle . Statistical analysis perform blinded biostatistician SPSS 13.0 software package . The investigator simultaneously analyze primary endpoint full analysis set ( FAS ) per protocol set ( PPS ) . Continuous variable compare use two-sample independent t-test Wilcoxon rank-sum test . Categorical variable compare use chi-squared Fisher 's exact test . The Breslow-Day test use test heterogeneity treatment effect across stratum . All report P-values two-sided . Data report mean ±Standard Deviation ( SD ) median ( range ) continuous variable number ( % ) categorical variable . Since adjustment control group minimal , investigator also report point estimate 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) . For outcome , P-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
