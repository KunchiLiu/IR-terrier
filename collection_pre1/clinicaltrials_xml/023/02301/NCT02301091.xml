	<brief_title>Combine TACE RFA Versus TACE Alone HCC With PVTT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) sixth common cancer second common cause death cancer globally . Although development image technique improve early HCC diagnosis , portal vein tumor thrombus ( PVTT ) still identify 12.5-39.7 % HCC patient initial visit . Patients suffer extremely aggressive HCC PVTT median survival time 2.7-4.0 month leave untreated . The current standard practice recommend sorafenib , show prolong overall survival ( OS ) nearly 3 month advanced HCC patient 1.5-3.2 month PVTT . Transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) main treatment modality unresectable HCC patient . Some recent prospective study demonstrate TACE serve safe effective procedure select HCC patient PVTT . TACE recommend part patient HCC PVTT treatment guideline China Japan . However , due poor blood supplement PVTT , local control rate PVTT TACE treatment low . Besides , hypovascular intrahepatic tumor , TACE also could control effectively . As regard high local control rate radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) intrahepatic lesion PVTT report study , thus suggest combination TACE RFA might higher tumor control rate survival benefit TACE alone . We design study compare survival outcomes TACE plus RFA TACE alone patient HCC PVTT.A total 240 patient need accord statistician 's calculation.They divide two group randomly computer sign inform consent form.One group patient receive TACE plus RFA group patient receive TACE alone.After treatment , patient followed-up survival , tumor response adverse event .</detailed_description>
