	<brief_summary>Main objective evaluate relation increase urethral mobility unsuccessful treatment TVT TOT operation . 140 patient include research plan TVT TOT operation SUI MUI diagnoses.Female patient 25 70 year age positive stress test include . All patient question parity , body mass index , menopausal state , medical history , examine POP-Q stage , urodynamy , stress test , UDI 6 , IIQ7 transperineal sonography preoperatively . `` Passive mobility angle '' `` active mobility angle '' measure . The relationship passive mobility angle active mobility angle success sling operation determine study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transperineal sonography perform 300 cc fill bladder state , horizon connects low margin pubic bone low side urethral part bladder . First measurement do litotomy position rest state , second 45 degree reverse trandelenburg position rest state third one 45 degree reverse trandelenburg position maximal valsalva strain state . The alteration angle measure rest litotomy position rest reverse trandelenburg position name `` passive mobility angle '' ( trigger gap ) angle measure trigger gap maximal valsalva state name `` active mobility angle '' . Furthermore , post voiding residue also measure transperineal ultrasonography .</detailed_description>
