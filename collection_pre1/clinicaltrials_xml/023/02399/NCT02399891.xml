	<detailed_description>Background Patients suffer myocardial infraction ( MI ) may minimal extensive myocardial damage . While severe leave ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction persist beyond initial 2-3 month MI predictor sudden death , prognostic significance less severe LV dysfunction MI unclear . There significant clinical value quantify LV function recovery phase MI . This information vital guiding breadth duration therapy know improve prognosis ( beta-blockers , ACE inhibitor , angiotensin blocker , anticoagulant , others ) . Further , identify patient therapy , implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) , recommend . Yet , guideline guide clinical decision making term collect follow-up ejection fraction ( EF ) data patient also overt heart failure . Purpose The Acute Myocardial Infarction Quality Assurance ( AMIQA ) project propose 1. document clinical practice collect data proportion patient initial LV dysfunction MI without follow-up EF assessment arrange , 2. collect follow-up EF data patient initial LV dysfunction post-MI evaluate prognostic significant EF early late MI well factor associate change value , 3. educate physician regard importance EF reassessment MI . Follow LV assessment The current guideline clearly provide clear indication appropriate time modality follow leave ventricular assessment . We choose define adequate follow LV assessment occur within 2 12 month post-myocardial infarction , measure modality echocardiography , cardiac MRI , nuclear perfusion scan . Overall Study Objectives 1 . To evaluate relationship change EF MI clinical variable age , gender , co-morbid condition , MI characteristic , prescription pharmacological agent MI . 2 . To assess relationship change EF MI clinical outcome . Study Methodology Data Collection This study conduct three phase : 1. determine exist practice assess leave ventricular ejection fraction follow myocardial infarction within Calgary region ( Quality Assurance ) ; 2. determine factor associate LVEF improvement , stability decline post-MI relationship outcome ( Prognostic Factor Study ) ; 3. educate clinical community importance follow LVEF assessment report finding presentation , educational material and/or academic publication ( Knowledge Dissemination ) Study Population The study population include patient present acute myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI STEMI ) undergo cardiac catheterization Foothills Medical Center , significant leave ventricular impairment upon initial LV assessment define least : - At least mod dysfunction ( LVEF &lt; 0.40 ) prior history MIs ( i.e . first MI ) - More mild-moderate dysfunction ( LVEF &lt; 0.45 ) prior history MI Exclusion criterion include : patient lose follow family physician primary cardiologist , patient decease follow-up EF . Patients identify use APPROACH ( Alberta Provincial Project Outcome Assessment Coronary Heart Disease ( www.approach.org ) ) database . All patient provide write , inform consent part participation APPROACH . AMIQA Phase I : Quality Assurance Part One ( Quality Assurance ) include patient MI occur July 1 , 2010 November 30 , 2011 ( 15 month ) . The list patient myocardial infarction undergo cardiac catheterization Foothills Medical Center date obtain APPROACH database . For patient meet initial inclusion criterion significant LV dysfunction post-MI , study group determine follow LVEF assessment perform within 2 12 month post-MI contact patient 's family physician and/or primary cardiologist record LVEF measurement , search follow electronic database . AMIQA Phase II : Prognostic Factor Study Part Two ( Prognostic Factor Study ) include patient myocardial infarction occur December 5 , 2011 December 5 , 2012 ( 12 month ) . The list patient myocardial infarction undergo cardiac catheterization Foothills Medical Center date obtain APPROACH database . For patient meet initial inclusion criterion significant LV dysfunction post-MI ( described section 5.1 ) , study group contact patient , patient 's family physician , and/or patient 's primary cardiologist order follow LVEF measurement within 2 12 month post- myocardial infarction . That , patient significant LV dysfunction undergo follow LVEF measurement December 5 , 2011 December 5 , 2012 . Modalities follow LVEF measurement include echocardiogram , cardiac MRI , nuclear perfusion image discretion family physician primary cardiologist . These follow LVEF measurement enter APPROACH database order allow u evaluate clinical significance change EF MI prognostic significance initial versus follow-up EF value . Data Analysis AMIQA Phase I : Quality Assurance Data collect entered database summary statistic create ( e.g . proportion follow LVEF assessment complete post-MI ( Aim 5.1 ) , choice modality follow LVEF assessment , etc . ) Data collect survey enter database analyze SAS Stata . Summary statistic create data collect survey . Acute Myocardial Infarction Quality Assurance ( AMIQA ) Project Research Protocol - Updated Feb 29 , 2012 AMIQA Phase II : Prognostic Factor Study As part AMIQA Phase II , LVEF assessment enter APPROACH database . The study compare initial LVEF measurement post-MI follow-up LVEF measurement , assess improvement , stability deterioration LVEF factor associate change LVEF . This project receive ethic approval Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board University Calgary . Patients identify use APPROACH database provide write , inform consent part participation APPROACH . Only research team know names contact information patient include study , information keep confidential .</detailed_description>
