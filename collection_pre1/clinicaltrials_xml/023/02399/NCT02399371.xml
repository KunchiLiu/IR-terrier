	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate patient malignant mesothelioma treat pembrolizumab A ) unselected patient population , well B ) program cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) positive population ( trial proceed Part B , PD-L1 expression correlate improve efficacy ) . II . To determine optimal threshold PD-L1 expression use 22C3 antibody base immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) assay correlation tumor response . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival patient malignant mesothelioma A ) unselected patient population B ) PD-L1 positive population treat pembrolizumab . II . To determine overall survival patient malignant mesothelioma A ) unselected patient population B ) PD-L1 positive population treat pembrolizumab . III . To determine disease control rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] + stable disease [ SD ] ) patient malignant mesothelioma treat pembrolizumab A ) unselected patient population B ) PD-L1 positive population . IV . To determine toxicity patient malignant mesothelioma treat pembrolizumab . V. To determine percentage patient mesothelioma PD-L1 tumor expression , distribution PD-L1 expression ( percent positivity tumor cells/stroma stain ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize T-cell inflamed phenotype mesothelioma patient via presence cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8 tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) and/or use gene expression signature ( Nanostring ) . II . To evaluate immune escape mechanism include indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase ( IDO ) expression , regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) ( forkhead box P3 [ FOXP3 ] expression ) , myeloid-derived suppressor cell ( MDSCs ) checkpoint immunohistochemistry ( method e.g . flow cytometry ) . III . To determine PD-L1 expression mass spectrometry correlate tumor response , PD-L1 expression IHC , T-cell inflame phenotype . IV . To determine immune cell population present fresh tumor ( available ) , via tumor digest mass spectrometry-based flow cytometric analysis ( e.g . use CyTOF ) multiplex fashion patient fresh tumor tissue . V. To characterize T-cell receptor repertoire TILs compare circulate T-cells mesothelioma patient available fresh frozen tissue ( spectrotyping , T-cell repertoire sequence [ e.g . use Adaptive platform ] ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may eligible 1 year additional pembrolizumab therapy progress stop pembrolizumab . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day ( 90 day serious adverse event ) , every 8 week patient experience confirm disease progression start new anti-cancer therapy , every 12 week 3 year .</detailed_description>
