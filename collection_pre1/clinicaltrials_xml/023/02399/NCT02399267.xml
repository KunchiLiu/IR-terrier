	<brief_summary>The requirement invasive mechanical ventilation define feature critical illness . Liberation wean process work breathing transfer ventilator back patient . Approximately 40 % time spent mechanical ventilation dedicate weaning . Limiting duration invasive ventilation identify key research priority critical care . Studies support use screening protocol ( daily vs. usual care ) identify wean candidate conduct test patient 's ability breathe spontaneously ( SBTs ) . While daily screen current standard care national intensive care unit ( ICUs ) , poorly align 24/7 ICU care environment wherein critically ill patient ' status change hour hour . Only one large trial compare alternative SBT technique [ T-piece v PS ( Pressure Support ) ] . No trial compare strategy frequent screen daily screen alternative SBT technique . The presence respiratory therapist ( RTs ) 24/7 North American ICUs present unique opportunity screen frequently , conduct frequent SBTs , determine optimal strategy liberate critically ill adult invasive ventilation . The investigator propose conduct pilot randomize trial 100 critically ill adult compare 'once daily ' screen 'at least twice daily ' screen PS vs. T-piece SBTs 12 Canadian ICUs . In proposed trial , investigator ( ) ass ability recruit critically ill adult breathe spontaneously initiate breath one several commonly use mode ventilation trial , ( ii ) evaluate clinician 's ability implement trial design , ( iii ) ass current practice sedation , analgesia delirium management time patient mobilization prior conduct screen assessment , ( iv ) identify barrier ( clinician , institutional ) enrol patient , ( v ) characterize trial participant base wean difficulty , ( vi ) obtain preliminary estimate impact alternative screening SBT strategies clinically important outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Identifying optimal time patient ready wean invasive ventilation challenge often arbitrary . To identify wean candidate , current guideline recommend clinician use combination subjective clinical assessment objective measurement . However , clinician 's subjective assessment wean readiness underestimate probability patient successfully liberated mechanical ventilation . Even objective measurement , respiratory frequency tidal volume ratio rapid shallow breathing index ( f/VT ) , limited value [ Likelihood ratio + 1.58 ( 1.30 -1.90 ) ] predict successful extubation trial spontaneous breathe trial ( SBT ) . More two decade research support use specific strategy limit duration invasive ventilation include ( ) use multidisciplinary screening protocol identify SBT candidate , ( ii ) conduct SBTs patient meet screening criterion , ( iii ) use specific mode technique Pressure Support ( PS ) daily SBTs [ e.g. , PS T-piece ( support ) ] discontinue support patient fail initial SBT require weaning . Compared usual care , early trial show protocolized weaning , lead allied health care provider ( RTs , nurse ) reduce weaning time . A systematic review meta-analysis 11 trial involve 1,971 critically ill patient , conduct one investigative member study team ( KB ) , demonstrate screening protocol reduce total duration mechanical ventilation , time spend wean ICU length stay . Only 1 trial ( n=385 ) compare twice daily screen lead RTs bedside nurse usual care ( require physician order conduct SBT ) find significantly short duration ventilation trend toward low ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) rate twice daily screen group . The investigator 's prior work demonstrate daily screen current standard care nationally internationally . Further , trial compare two frequently use SBT technique internationally [ PS T-piece ] . Consequently , little know frequently patient screen technique use conduct SBTs Canadian ICUs today . The FAST trial address important gap knowledge . The propose study novel seek identify optimal screen SBT strategy minimize patient ' exposure invasive ventilation complication associate . It evaluate wean strategy deliver critically ill adult determine whether alternative delivery strategy may improve patient outcomes . Only one wean trial conduct Canada previously member investigative team ( KB , MM ) . Establishing role frequent screen appeal ICU clinician ( intensivists , RTs , nurse , physiotherapist ) sensible low-risk intervention represent cost-effective use current resource . Moreover , simple intervention hold promise strategy could change clinical practice , enhance care deliver critically ill adult , improve patient outcome . In FAST Trial , eligible patient randomize screening frequency ( vs. least twice daily ) SBT technique ( PS vs. T-piece ) . The investigator propose evaluate feasibility conduct open-label , multicentre , factorial design trial involve 100 critically ill adult compare screen frequency SBT technique 12 Canadian ICUs . In pilot trial , investigator ( ) evaluate ability recruit desire population , ( ii ) ass clinician adherence screen SBT protocol , ( iii ) identify potential confounders , ( iv ) characterize trial participant base wean difficulty , ( iv ) obtain preliminary estimate effect alternative screening SBT strategy important outcome . In pilot trial , investigative team also assess 'current practice ' regard sedation , analgesia , delirium management , well , time mobilization prior screen assessment identify practice may bias duration ventilation require protocolization future , plan large scale wean trial . All participate adult ICUs currently titrate sedation use either Sedation-Agitation Scale ( SAS ) Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ( RASS ) , dedicate RT personnel present 24 hour per day/7 day per week either full time , part time , consult Physiotherapists . The investigator determine propose multicentre screen randomize control trial ( RCT ) : A . Feasible , specifically , investigative team : 1 . Recruit critically ill adult breathe spontaneously Pressure Support ( PS ) proportional assist ventilation ( PAV ) , trigger breaths volume pressure Assist Control ( AC ) , volume pressure Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation ( SIMV ) ± PS , Pressure Regulated Volume Control ( PRVC ) Airway Pressure Release Ventilation ( APRV ) trial compare 'once daily ' 'at least twice daily ' screen identify wean candidate , 2 . Comply 'once daily ' 'at least twice daily ' screen assessment protocol minimal contamination 'once daily ' arm , 3 . Comply PS T-piece SBT protocols minimal contamination either arm , 4 . Quantify potential co-interventions ( sedation , analgesia delirium management time mobilization ) may lead performance bias may require protocolization future , plan , large scale wean trial , 5 . Identify barrier ( clinician institutional ) recruitment , 6 . Classify trial participant require ( ) simple , ( ii ) difficult ( iii ) prolong wean use establish definition , 7 . Obtain preliminary estimate impact alternative screening ( 'once daily ' vs. 'at least twice daily ' ) SBT technique ( PS vs. T-piece ) important outcome [ e.g. , time first SBT first successful SBT , time first extubation successful extubation , total duration mechanical ventilation , ICU hospital length stay , ICU hospital mortality , use noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) extubation B . Safe , regard proportion patient experience wean related complication ( self-extubation , reintubation , tracheostomy ) screen SBT strategy . Information obtain pilot trial inform design plan large scale trial evaluate time first successful SBT completion ( SBT outcome ) time first successful extubation ( wean extubation outcome ) . In manner , investigator assess feasibility conducting multicentre , multinational RCT address important research question .</detailed_description>
