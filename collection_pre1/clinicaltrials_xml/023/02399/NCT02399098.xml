	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Attentional Strategies Throwing Performance Gaze Behavior Self-paced Tasks Under Fatigue Non-fatigue Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participant arrive Ribstein Center Sports Medicine Research Wingate Institute four different occasion , 2-3 day apart , order complete three motor learn phase . Session 1 2 include acquisition phase , Session 3 include retention transfer phase , last visit , Session 4 , include fatigue session . Sessions 1 2 The participant inform purpose , method , study protocol . Then informed consent form provide participant sign . The participant learn throw task accord specific instruction . Participants group give technical instruction throw dart . The technical instruction follow attentional focus instruction differ group . After receive instruction , participant group give questionnaire fill . The researcher go answer participant ensure instruction understood . If need , instruction repeat appropriate understanding performance achieve . Then , 3-min practice period begin . The participant internal focus group ask perform throw movement arm 20 time without hold dart . The external focus group 's participant ask perform throw motion 20 time hold dart . The participant control group ask practice stance , posture , hold dart . Testing begin preparation period . The Mobile Eye gaze track system fit calibrated six different reference location . The calibration target board six `` X '' shape space 30 cm apart white paper place target . The external video locate perpendicular participant way upper body arm movement see frame . The participant perform dart throw task 5 block 12 trial , 2-min rest block trial . During 2-min rest interval researcher remind participant use attenational focus strategy . During rest interval block , system 's calibration check calibrated necessary . In total , participant complete 120 trial dart throw task acquisition phase . Session 3 Upon arrival Lab , participant fit Mobile Eye system , calibration perform . The external video camera turn participant perform dart throw task 2 block 10 trial , 2min rest . A transfer task perform 15-min break . Participants re-fitted Mobile Eye re-calibration performed . The transfer task ( underarm throw ) perform 2 block 10 trial 2-min rest . Session 4 On fourth final visit , participant randomly assign two group . Each subgroup perform two block 10 trial , 60-sec rest , different type anaerobic physical exertion : ( 1 ) Leg Anaerobic condition ( WAnT-leg ) : use modify WAnT , ( 2 ) Arm anaerobic condition ( WAnT-arm ) : use WAnT arm modification . Before commence exercise test protocol , anthropometric measure determine participant . Height body mass measure use stadiometer ( Seca , Birmingham , UK ) digital scale ( Model HBF-514C , Omron Healthcare Inc , Bannockburn , Illinois ) , respectively , record near 0.1 cm 0.1 kg , respectively . Skinfold thickness measure triplicate use Caliper ( Skyndex System 1 , Caldwell , Justiss &amp; Company , Inc , Fayetteville , Arkansas , USA ) . The follow site evaluate : biceps , triceps , subscapular , suprailiac . Adiposity ( percentage body fat ) estimate appropriate skinfold measurement use Durning Womersly equation ( Durnin &amp; Womersley , 1974 ) . All measurement perform investigator . Preceding anthropometric measurement begin either test , either ergometer individually adjust fit participant 's height body size . A heart rate monitor ( Polar FT1 , Polar Electro , USA ) wear subject order record heart rate data . The eye track system put calibrate . Then participant remove apparatus begin physical exertion test . Subsequently , participant warm WAnT-leg ( men=75 W ; women=50 W ) WAnT-arm ( men=30 W ; women=unloaded ) exercise 60 rpm 5 min . During warm-up period , participant ask perform three all-out 5-sec sprint command researcher . Following warm-up , participant rest quietly 10 min . Then participants perform ten consecutive 10 second sprint intersperse 15 second recovery interval . The participant instruct sprint fast possible 10 second . Verbal encouragement give test . The resistance men set 0.931 0.601 N/Kg-1 , woman 0.833 0.470 N/Kg-1 WAnT-leg WAnT-arm , respectively ( Weber , Chia , &amp; Inbar , 2006 ) . Participants instruct remain seat throughout test give verbal encouragement maintain all-out effort throughout 10 second sprint . During sprint , peak mean power output calculate . Peak power ( PP ) high power produce 1 sec segment 10 second sprint , whereas mean power ( MP ) calculate average power 10 second duration . PP MP express watts relative body mass ( W/Kg ) . A fatigue index ( FI ) calculate absolute difference PP MP divide PP express percentage ( % FI ) . In order monitor exercise intensity exertion protocol , follow measure obtain prior begin test , end last 10 second sprint 3min 5min last sprint : heart rate , lactate level , rate perceive exertion . Five minute complete WAnT-leg or-arm test , participant put eye tracking apparatus ; need system re-calibrated . Then subject ask perform throw task without additional explanation . This time period chosen base previous study find peak lactate WAnT test occur follow approximately 5 min recovery ( Weinstein , Bediz , Dotan , &amp; Falk , 1998 ) . At end fourth session , participant ask fill learn strategy ' implementation questionnaire . This 4-questions questionnaire include two close-ended question two open-ended question , meant check whether participant use assigned attentional focus strategy .</detailed_description>
