	<brief_summary>The number turf field experience important increase public private facility last year . This artificial surface predominant soccer field next year . Among turf field many different type depend construction characteristic ( without asphalt base , elastic base , rubber filling , etc. ) . Officially type artificial turf similar stability impact absorption characteristic . On hand great variety soccer-boots , especially youth soccer player , similar football star . Many evidence support fact person exercise many different type impacts-stimulus necessary order stimulate bone skeletal muscle system . However , know yet whether effect extend shorten depend type artificial surface soccer-boots use , even whether could less dangerous and/or provoke injuries/disagreement among user . Little information available youth soccer player point direction still controversial . Furthermore , bone strength depend bone mass bone structure microarchitecture . The cross sectional area , cortex thickness trabecular density important aspect bone health . There study effect interaction turf field soccer boot bone architecture youth soccer player . This information relevant present future health adolescent practice football organization promote sport . Due fact turf field preferentially use youth population , important know real effect interaction different type artificial surface soccer boot child bone mass development . Nowadays , data and/or define guideline answer unresolved question , thus main aim present project identify turf field soccer boot adequate optimize acquisition bone mass child soccer player .</brief_summary>
