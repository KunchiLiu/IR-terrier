	<brief_summary>Pulmonary rehabilitation clearly increase exercise capacity , effect physical activity home community setting less clear . It may take long time increase physical activity occur . It state editorial take 3 month train muscle 6 month train brain . The Investigators first evaluate change physical activity follow pulmonary rehabilitation use state-of-the-science motion detector , Investigators follow trajectory physical activity next several month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Trajectory Physical Activity Following Pulmonary Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study follow physical activity follow pulmonary rehabilitation longitudinally 48 week . Investigators use state-of-the-art accelerometer , analyze minute walk per day primary outcome , rather vector magnitude unit ( VMU ) estimate step per day . Investigators explore potential factor influence important outcome , include baseline activity level , demographic variable , change exercise capacity , psychological variable , self-efficacy score . Finally , Investigators evaluate rate change ( trajectory ) physical activity approximately six month pulmonary rehabilitation . There limited data suggest take time translation increase exercise capacity increase physical activity occur .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Adults ( â‰¥ 40 year ) primary clinical diagnosis COPD 2 . A postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.70 spirometry perform within precede 12 month ( specific FEV1 percentpredicted requirement , although anticipate FEV1 average around 45 % predict , base previous study pulmonary rehabilitation ) 3 . The patient refer pulmonary rehabilitation 4 . The patient clinicallystable : exacerbation precede 4 week 5 . Modified Medical Research Council ( mMRC ) dyspnea rating least 2 5 . 1 . Disease severity comorbidity would make patient atrisk participation study 2 . A significant movement disorder , hemiplegia , etc . 3 . Inability read comprehend questionnaire , English 4 . A history poor wound heal chronic skin condition might predispose local problem wear DynaPort . ( The DynaPort wear outside thin garment , tee shirt , relatively thin , without protrude part . However , since device may wear overnight , remote risk pressure problem , exclusion criterion add ) .</criteria>
