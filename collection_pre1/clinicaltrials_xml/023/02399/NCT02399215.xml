	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well nintedanib work treat patient neuroendocrine tumor spread start nearby tissue lymph node ( locally advance ) spread primary site ( place start ) place body ( metastatic ) . Nintedanib may stop growth tumor cell slow stop certain type receptor call vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) attach target . This may stop growth neuroendocrine tumor block growth new blood vessel necessary tumor growth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression free survival ( PFS ) , define time interval initiation therapy , cessation documentation progressive disease ( PD ) death . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical response ( complete response + partial response ) patient measurable disease ( use standard Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] version [ v ] 1.1 criterion ) . II . To assess overall survival ( OS ) patient . III . Assess change quality life ( QOL ) throughout treatment use European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) quality life questionnaire ( QLQ ) - Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors ( NET ) 21 ( GI.NET21 ) questionnaire carcinoid patient gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor , patient fill least two QOL questionnaire , report group base response ( response , stable disease progressive disease ) . IV . Steady-state pharmacokinetics ( PK ) nintedanib , biomarkers , regulatory T cell ( Treg ) cytokine expression growth factor analyze patient report group base response . V. Gene mutation copy number alteration analysis mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway ( perform first 10 patient ) , protein expression activation protein kinase B ( Akt ) ( well downstream target ) . VI . Toxicity ( grade use National Cancer Institute [ NCI ] Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events [ CTCAE ] version 4.0 ) closely monitored toxicity tabulate . OUTLINE : Patients receive nintedanib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
