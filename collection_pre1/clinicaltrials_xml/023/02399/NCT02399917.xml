	<brief_title>An Open-label Study Lirilumab ( BMS-986015 ) Combination With 5-azacytidine ( Vidaza ) Treatment Patients With Refractory/ Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 5 group 6 participant enrol lead-in phase study , 40 participant enrol Phase 2 . If enrol lead-in phase , dose lirilumab 5-azacytidine receive depend join study . The first group participant receive start dose combination level . If intolerable side effect see , next group may receive low dose level lirilumab and/or 5-azacytidine . This continue high tolerable combination dose find . If enrolled Phase 2 , receive lirilumab 5-azacytidine high dose tolerate lead-in phase . Study Treatment : You receive study drug cycle 28 day long . However , cycle may shorter long depend if/how disease respond treatment , bone marrow react treatment , study doctor think best interest . On Days 1-7 study cycle , receive 5-azacytidine daily either vein 1 hour injection skin . It possible start receive drug one way switch study doctor think best interest . On Day 8 ( +/- 2 day ) cycle , also receive lirilumab vein 1 hour . Your dose 5-azacytidine may raise , lower , and/or delay doctor think best interest . Your dose lirilumab may also delay doctor think best interest . Though receive lirilumab MD Anderson every time receive , possible first 4 cycle able receive 5-azacytidine convenient location . Talk study staff receive drug local treatment center . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle , physical exam . During first 3 cycle , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test 1 time week . After first 3 cycle , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test every 2-4 week . On Day 28 Cycle 1 ( +/- 7 day ) , every 1-3 cycle , bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check status disease . You blood draws and/or bone marrow aspiration time doctor think need study . After Cycle 1 , may able study test perform local clinic . Talk study staff option . Length Study : It plan may receive 24 cycle study drug , possible may continue take study drug study doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Study Visit : If take leave study end Cycle 24 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate check status disease . Follow-Up : You ask return clinic follow-up visit physical exam 30 day stop receive study drug . If come clinic , call 30 day go study ask side effect and/or new treatment ( ) . This call last 5 minute . If go study reason disease get bad , call every 3-6 month 5 year ask . Each call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Lirilumab FDA approve commercially available . 5-azacytidine FDA-approved commercially available treatment MDS , lead AML , approve treatment AML . The use drug combination investigational . The study doctor explain drug design work . Up 64 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
