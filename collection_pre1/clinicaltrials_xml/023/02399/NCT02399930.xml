	<brief_summary>Currently , breathe rate heart rate check nursing staff manually every hour enter patient 's medical record . The investigator study see device automatically record breathing rate heart rate every 15 minute accurate manual measurement . The investigator also see measurement , take every 15 minute , help u predict adverse event quickly accurately measurement take every hour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Automated Respiration Rate Improve Accuracy Electronic Cardiac Arrest Risk Triage Score ( eCART ) Algorithm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both cardiac arrest sepsis primarily identify vital sign abnormality . However , practice nurse designees routinely check hospitalize patient ' vital sign every four eight hour throughout day night remain essentially unchanged one hundred year . While respiratory rate show predictive vital sign adverse event ward , often inaccurately measure poorly document . For example , disproportionate amount respiratory rate record either 18 20 breaths/min , often high actual rate . We previously statistically derive physiology-based early warning score , call electronic cardiac arrest risk triage score ( eCART ) , use vital sign lab value . The eCART accurate score commonly use hospital today . However , vital sign value utilize score manually collected nursing staff every four hour . Recent technological advance allow high-frequency measurement pulse respiratory rate use cableless respiration monitor . These device allow frequent potentially accurate measure respiration , may enhance prediction ability detect adverse event ward . In addition , increase monitoring frequency may result early detection adverse event , could translate improvement patient outcomes . A subset patient may continuously measure use telemetry system . The alarm ECGs patient monitor staff centralize station hospital . When clinical event require action observe , call make unit alert clinical staff action necessary . We collect continuous measurement collect system compare continuous measurement high frequency manual measurement .</detailed_description>
