	<brief_summary>Lung Health research study ( Development predictive model ) - To determine whether I-neb breathe parameter ( flow data ) act surrogate marker lung function ( Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second FEV1 ) hence allow early detection decline lung function cystic fibrosis patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Remote Telemonitoring Detect Early Decline Lung Function &amp; Streamline Clinics Adults With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Initial phase study involve retrospective data collection , review 36 month retrospectively collect clinic time data ( i.e . total length appointment , length time see discipline , wait time ) . This data routinely collect displayed run chart . It use allow understanding baseline variability standard un-streamed clinic whether distinct patient sub-populations identify i.e . red ( complicated time consume ) green ( simple rapidly process ) stream . These data may suggest start structure clinic slot length provide baseline comparator subsequent bespoke clinic structure . 2 . In prospective intervention phase , To recruit 50 participant take part bespoke clinic use home spirometer , weigh scale , Bluetooth enable I-neb provide breathe parameter adherence data . 3 . Participants ' baseline routinely collect demographic ( age , gender , genotype ) clinical data ( include comorbidities , number intravenous antibiotic day clinic attendance per year , treatment regime ) record . 4 . At baseline participant ask complete Patient Activation Measure questionnaire . This patient-reported measure powerful reliable tool validate UK24 . It involve 13 quick question identify patient 's knowledge , skill , confidence manage health health care . 5 . Participants ask measure lung function weight one week prior clinic . The I-neb adherence flow data routinely capture transfer . 6 . Prior clinic data collect participant ask EQ-5D-5L , require repeat prescription , whether issue would like focus attend consultation . 7 . This data review determine stream patient would predict need require . i.e . adherence support , diagnostic , stable brief review . 8 . Following review standard clinic process analyse see whether stream would appropriate could potentially saved time resource .</detailed_description>
