We aim undertake smallscale trial two site ( Phase 2 ) , assess feasibility intervention scope move full trial clinical cost effectiveness . We also aim evaluate implementation new intervention use mixed method research , monitor randomisation procedure , treatment fidelity , staff time ( associated cost ) , engagement , retention range outcome measure , reflect multiple vulnerability population . We thereby address brief 's central aim assess feasibility familybased intervention group whether trial could successfully undertake . Phase 1 : Intervention Development Using original Intervention structure content platform , overall aim adapt family social intervention collaboration experience use service order ensure acceptable young people family , remain focused important aspect promote support behaviour change yet realistic deliverable way maximises treatment engagement , take account young people 's view preference .
