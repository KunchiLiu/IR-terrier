	<brief_summary>The purpose research study investigate new negative pressure incision ( surgical cut ) management system , could reduce occurrence groin wound infection vascular surgery . This single use , sterile dress applied patient 's skin . It attach battery-powered unit provide negative pressure ( vacuum environment ) dress disposable canister collection wound fluid . The patient ask participate study patient plan vascular surgery procedure involve groin incision .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Evaluate Negative Pressure Incision Management System Groin Wounds Vascular Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical site infection ( SSI ) groin wound vascular surgery significant contribute factor increase morbidity . Despite use prophylactic systemic antibiotic , postoperative groin wound infection still occur circumstance continue serious problem vascular surgical procedure . The incidence SSI vary 5 - 40 % , depend upon depth infection type vascular procedure , morbidity could range prolonged hospital stay limb loss . Increased incidence SSIs patient related systemic factor like Diabetes , hypertension ( HTN ) , history smoking , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , local factor like disruption lymphatics , groin proximity perineum , previous surgery site use prosthetic graft material . Prophylactic systemic antibiotic routinely use vascular surgery procedure , despite gentle tissue handling , proper hemostasis technical point minimize tissue trauma , SSIs happen . The investigator hypothesize use close dress system negative pressure keep surgical site protect nearby contaminated field decrease risk infection</detailed_description>
