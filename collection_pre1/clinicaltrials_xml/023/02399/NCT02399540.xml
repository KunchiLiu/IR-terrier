	<brief_summary>Rationale : About 80 % stroke patient suffer motor impairment , current therapy limit effect motor recovery . Therefore , investigate new potential therapeutic approach crucial . Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) form non-invasive electrical stimulation weak current apply electrode scalp . This stimulation know ( 1 ) induce change neuronal excitability -which last one day late LTP-like plasticity protocols- polarity site-specific manner , ( 2 ) facilitate motor learn stroke recovery . However , unknown motor cortex excitability change follow tDCS relate increase motor learn recovery potential . The currently upheld hypothesis motor learn need synchronized time electrical stimulation ( paired stimulation ) , recent result lab suggest tDCS also increase skill learn stimulation end ( unpaired stimulation ) . If true , tDCS much large therapeutic window valuable clinical tool currently believe . Therefore , investigator want investigate late LTP-like plasticity tDCS affect increase skill learn normally see tDCS apply 24 hour train . The outcome study provide important guideline effective motor therapy stroke rehabilitation . Objective : Identify effect late LTP-like plasticity tDCS chronic stroke patient skill learn 24 hour later . Study design : Double-blinded , randomized between-subjects trial . Study population : Chronic stroke patient . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main objective study determine effect late LTP-like plasticity tDCS skill learn 24 hour later . As motor learn paradigm , investigator use circuit track task chronic stroke patient perform good tDCS apply concurrently . During task , patient trace cursor circuit fast accurately possible move computer mouse . Skill quantify calculate combine speed/ accuracy score skill improvement compare baseline ( LI ; learn index ) compare sham , conventional unpaired tDCS , conventional pair tDCS group late LTP-like plasticity tDCS group .</brief_summary>
