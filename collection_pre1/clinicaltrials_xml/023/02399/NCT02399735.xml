	<brief_title>Safety Study NK Cells From Sibship Treat Recurrence HCC After Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one indication liver transplantation . With advancement liver transplantation associate science technology , recurrence tumor posttransplantation become principal contradiction worsen prognosis therefore prevention recurrence HCC key improve efficacy liver transplantation . Adoptive cellular immunotherapy apply various malignant tumor include HCC obtain significant effect . But patient liver transplant immunosuppressed state , successfully apply immune cell prevent treat HCC relapse liver transplantation must balance immunosuppression anti-tumor immunity . It necessary consider safety adoptive cellular immunotherapy , also necessary consider effectiveness treatment immune cell immunosuppression state exert anti-tumor effect . Natural killer cell ( NK cell ) MHC-unrestricted kill effect malignant tumor cell major mediate cell GVHD , might optimum choice meet requirement . Patients confirm recurrence hepatocellular carcinoma liver transplantation Third Affiliated Hospital Sun Yat-sen University enrolled.Participants study assign one three treatment arm : Arm A : Participants receive conventional treatment low dose NK cell treatment 4 time . Arm B : Participants receive conventional treatment normal dose NK cell treatment 4 time . Arm C : Participants receive conventional treatment normal dose NK cell treatment 8 time . The cultured NK cell peripheral blood blood type take infused interval two week . Periodic liver function recheck image examination conduct 6 month last NK cell infusion .</detailed_description>
