	<brief_summary>Continuous haemoglobin determination could improve outcomes several patient risk bleed surgery . An vivo calibration introduce device team find need . The uncalilbrated validation Masimo Radical 7 continuous haemoglobin monitor make various paper , although compare point care device , thus introduce error point care device although validated haemoglobin determination , accurate gold standard . The validation gold standard calibrate device describe yet . When compare accept gold standard ( cyanmethemoglobin method , Coulter ) , accuracy precision continuous haemoglobin monitor could good enough use interchangeably gold standard .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Continuous Noninvasive Haemoglobin Monitoring Radical 7 Pulse CO-Oximetry Monitor After Vivo Adjustment .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Continuous haemoglobin determination could improve outcomes several patient risk bleed surgery . The vivo calibration adjust gold standard haemoglobin determination literature yet . Two blood sample withdraw time arterial line , one central laboratory one POC device . At exact time SpHb measurement record . At least eight sample expect per patient . A maximum 20 sample withdraw per patient . To compare bias , precision limit agreement among SpHb , LabHb COoxHb Bland Altman method use multiple observation per subject true value varies . An error grid analysis make know could affect clinical decision making .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult patient . Surgery duration least two hour . Patients schedule surgery general anaesthesia muscle relaxation . Radial arterial line need blood pressure control reason relate study . Radial arterial line indicate / possible place . Sampling difficult impossible . Need reposition arterial line arm surgery . Any illness could influence haemoglobin measurement .</criteria>
