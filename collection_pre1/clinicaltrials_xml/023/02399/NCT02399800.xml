	<detailed_description>1.0 Background Hypothesis : Chronic pancreatitis inflammatory disease pancreas characterize painful scarring loss glandular function.The prevalence chronic pancreatitis United States estimate 0.2 5 % result 86,000 hospitalization . The majority patient chronic pancreatitis develop significant abdominal pain debilitate result significant burden health care system . Multiple approach , include pancreatic enzyme , narcotic analgesia , celiac plexus block surgical ganglionectomy use treat pancreatic pain variable success . Injection local anesthesia agent steroids celiac plexus pain control use many year via surgical percutaneous approach . Topical therapy theoretically prevent conduction painful stimuli pancreas address inflammatory change afferent nerve . Splanchnic nerve pass pancreas thoracic root ganglion via celiac ganglion target intervention . Nerve change chronic pancreatitis include perineural inflammation , alter diameter , upregulation pain neuropeptides ( include Substance P ) associate increased sensitivity stimulus pancreas ( distension inflammation ) well pain independent stimulus ( neuropathic ) . Endoscopic ultrasound allow close proximity , high resolution assessment gastrointestinal tract wall adjacent anatomic structure . Physicians able perform EUS-guided celiac plexus injection outpatient set conscious sedation . The EUS guide approach offer well visualization celiac region direct access celiac plexus . EUS guide celiac plexus block core part routine care patient Los Angeles County Hospital chronic pancreatitis . Celiac plexus block recommendation refractory chronic pancreatitis pain European Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( ESGE ) . Several study show EUS-guided CPB beneficial role treat pain cause chronic pancreatitis . A randomized trial Gress et al look efficacy EUS-guided versus CT-guided celiac plexus block control abdominal pain chronic pancreatitis 18 patient . They find significant improvement pain symptom patient randomize EUS-guided celiac plexus block mean time period 10 week . A study group show improvement overall pain score 55 % 4 8 week follow-up 90 patient . Adverse event include diarrhea infection occur 3 % . A comprehensive review Kaufman et al 2010 evaluate efficacy EUS-guided celiac plexus block celiac plexus neurolysis alleviate chronic abdominal pain due chronic pancreatitis pancreatic cancer respectively . A total 6 study include analysis , comprise 221 patient , find EUS-guided celiac plexus block effective 51.46 % patient chronic pancreatitis . EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis ( alcohol ) effective 72.54 % pancreas cancer . These modest improvement celiac block chronic pancreatitis ( especially comparison celiac plexus neurolysis pancreas cancer ) lead investigator question whether EUS guide celiac plexus block effective treatment chronic pancreatitis pain despite routine use . Prospective randomize controlled study examine efficacy endoscopic ultrasound guide celiac plexus block lacking . 2.0 Objectives Purpose Our aim perform pilot randomize trial gauge degree celiac plexus block perform endoscopic ultrasound guidance benefit patient chronic pancreatitis . We assess whether celiac plexus block significantly decrease pain score , hospitalization , pain medication requirement increase ability return normal activity . 3.0 Study Design Patients present Los Angeles County Medical Center Gastroenterology Clinic chronic upper abdominal pain focus population study . Patients undergo endoscopic ultrasound standard clinical care ass chronic pancreatitis enrol . They must M-ANNHEIM severity score 6 great . Additionally , must least intermittent chronic pain intensity &gt; 3 visual analogue scale require opiate medication . The procedure perform experienced endosonographers . The EUS-guided celiac plexus block perform guidance linear array endosonography . A visual exam first perform EUS scope standard endoscope . Patients find significant peptic ulcer mucosal abnormality exclude symptom may secondary peptic disease . An EUS exam perform determine whether patient finding chronic pancreatitis . The diagnosis chronic pancreatitis confirm base EUS criterion ( meet four criterion hyperechoic focus , hyperechoic strand , lobularity , cyst , stone , dilation main pancreatic duct , irregular pancreatic-duct margin , presence side branch hyperechoic pancreatic duct-margins ) . Those confirmed chronic pancreatitis randomize ( 1:1 ) procedure celiac plexus block versus injection treatment . Randomization perform use computer program conceal allocation . The research coordinator obtain data follow visit patient blind randomization . The endosonographer blind . Ninety patient enrol ( see statistical consideration sample size calculation ) . Those randomize control undergo EUS confirmation chronic pancreatitis celiac plexus block . Patients treatment group receive celiac plexus block 10mL 0.25 % bupivacaine 2ml ( 40mg/cc ) triamcinolone standard dos . The 22 gauge needle inserted base celiac plexus via transgastric approach single injection perform . An intravenous antibiotic administer time block celiac plexus block group specific agent depend patient 's allergy profile . The research coordinator obtain data follow visit patient blind detail block ( lack thereof ) procedure record . Following procedure standard recovery room monitoring include assessment blood pressure perform 2 hour group . Periprocedural fluid antibiotic use celiac plexus block standardize discretion endoscopist perform case . Patients assessed procedure , immediately afterward , 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month follow procedure . At initial assessment follow visit Visual analogue pain score record well assessment ability work conduct activity daily live . Pain medication requirement whether symptom alleviate analgesic disrupt sleep note . The M-ANNHEIM scoring system use gauge symptom well . Additionally , patient complete focused version online CarePrep Program visit . The Online CarePrep ( OCA ) program use clinically evaluate patient complex symptom condition generally characterize significant physical symptom , psychosocial issue , impair quality-of-life functional status , disability , substance abuse . It online format successfully use outpatient various gastrointestinal illness report multifactorial symptom . When perform prior appointment appear facilitate efficient productive medical visit . 4.1 Side effects/Toxicities monitor : 4.11 Three common complication celiac plexus block include hypotension , transient diarrhea , transient increase pain . Extraordinarily rare/theoretical complication include paralysis , pneumothorax , loss sphincter function , retroperitoneal bleeding , renal puncture prolong gastroparesis . 4.12 Long term toxicity monitor completion celiac block 6 month patient follow . 4.2 Dosage change base toxicity There dosage adjustment procedure perform study period . 4.3 Adverse Event Reporting : 4.31 Type event report timing report . If patient develop adverse event include hypotension , transient diarrhea , transient increase pain , less common complication unilateral paresis paraplegia , pneumothorax , loss sphincter function , retroperitoneal bleeding , renal puncture , prolonged gastroparesis infection , report principal investigator review study team well two staff physician gastroenterology division part study team . This also report IRB . If patient experience event detect follow cod A ) relate study B ) relate study . Their severity A ) whether expect B ) expect also record . These complication also report principal investigator review study team well two staff physician gastroenterology division party study team . They also report IRB . 4.32 Places submit report : Adverse event report IRB data safety monitoring committee . 4.4 Data Monitoring Committee : The data safety monitoring committee include principal investigator medicine/gastroenterology well entire study team . Two outside senior physician gastroenterology surgery also ask participate . Meetings convene adverse event potentially related celiac block occur . 5.0 Statistical Considerations Descriptive statistic perform group , comparison make determine group balance stratification factor type pancreatitis . Patient characteristic compare group well determine imbalance possible covariates . We expect patient chronic pancreatitis secondary congenital abnormality pancreatic duct , ethanol abuse , familial , idiopathic etiology . The sample size 90 patient choose base preliminary sample size calculation . Based recent study 30 % patient pancreatitis type pain placebo arm derive benefit.16 The predicted response rate 51.5 % EUS guide celiac block base large review Kaufmann et al . For 2 side alpha 0.05 power 0.80 , 83 patient would necessary show difference .
