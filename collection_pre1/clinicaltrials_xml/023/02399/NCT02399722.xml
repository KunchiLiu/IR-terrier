	<brief_summary>In surgical unit negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) often use facilitate wound healing . The recommended frequency change every third fourth day cause immense workload . The purpose study evaluate effect additional polymeric membrane interface dressing ( PolyMem® WIC ) primary wound contact layer NPWT comparison NPWT alone number require dressing change wound closure primary endpoint . Secondary endpoint : time heal wound associate pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The treatment chronic wound require time resource . Optimized resource utilization treatment chronic wound medical economic interest . Negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) widely use treatment chronic wound surgical site infection . NPWT indicate treatment diabetic leg ulcer , low leg ulcer result peripheral arterial occlusive disease , pressure wound , surgical incisional wound , traumatic wound , burn , infected wound , necrotizing fasciitis , infect sternal wound , skin graft facilitate healing . The polyurethane foam NPWT directly apply wound bed seal transparent occlusive film prior application negative pressure 75 125 mmHg continuous suction . Prolonged placement foam wound bed result tissue ingrowth . Then , removal foam become increasingly difficult often accompany pain , bleeding , traumatization heal wound . Therefore , various effort make decrease wound tissue damage pain dress change , include use different primary wound filler , administration topical analgesic placement various interface dressing . Yet , effect non-adherent polymeric interface dress wearing time frequency dress change study . Methods : Sixty consecutive patient chronic wound low extremity surgical site infection revascularization randomly allocate either treatment conventional negative pressure wound therapy ( VAC arm , control ) negative pressure wound therapy additional polymeric interface dressing ( VAC + PolyMem® WIC , WICVAC , study arm ) . The polymeric membrane dress apply direct wound contact layer , cover polyurethane foam dress NPWT . The pink polymeric membrane dressing , leave partially visible margin wound bed black polyurethane foam , serve color indicator time-point dress change upon loss pink color . Patient characteristic , wound size dress change , pain treatment number dress change need wound closure document . Statistical analysis Sample size estimation base detect 20 % difference number dress change favor WICVAC - study arm , type I error 0.05 type II error 0.2 . At least 23 patient require study arm . Data analyze statistical distribution . Due skew data distribution Mann-Whitney-U test apply assessment difference primary secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
