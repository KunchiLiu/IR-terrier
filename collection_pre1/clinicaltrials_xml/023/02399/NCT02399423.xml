	<brief_summary>South Asians much high risk diabetes compare Europeans investigators n't know . Investigators think South Asians ' capacity store fat safely skin low Europeans , start store fat around internal organ liver muscle , low body weight Europeans . These increase level internal fat storage think increase risk diabetes . The purpose study therefore investigate whether difference weight gain weight loss fat storage , fat cell function metabolic risk factor , South Asians compare Europeans . Investigators compare South Asian European men start study , gain 7 % body weight , lose 7-15 % body weight ( peak weight ) see gain lose weight affect fat storage within body function fat cell . Investigators also assess effect weight gain weight loss metabolism , fitness risk factor diabetes heart disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The GlasVEGAS Study ( Glasgow Visceral &amp; Ectopic Fat With Weight Gain South AsianS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>South Asians five time risk adult onset diabetes ( high blood sugar ) Europeans nearly one five South Asian men United Kingdom disease . Diabetes serious disease lead number adverse health consequence include heart disease , kidney disease blindness account 10 % healthcare cost UK . Obesity strongly link diabetes risk , adverse effect get fatter diabetes risk much high South Asians Europeans . The purpose study understand case . When human put weight initially fat store skin ( subcutaneous fat ) . This relatively safe . However , capacity skin storage exceed , fat store internally within tummy area ( visceral fat ) organs liver muscle , less safe increase diabetes risk . Investigators think South Asians ' capacity store fat safely skin low Europeans , fat store internally liver muscle lower body weight Europeans . The purpose study investigate whether occurs . To investigator compare group South Asian European men see gain lose weight affect fat storage within body function fat cell . Investigators also assess effect weight gain weight loss metabolism , fitness risk factor diabetes heart disease . The study include healthy men normal weight age 18-45 year either white European South Asian ( parent Indian , Pakistani , Bangladesh Sri Lankan origin ) ethnic origin . Body weight alter initially gain weight lose weight . To participant initially eat food 4-6 week go diet combine exercise 12 week . Participation study last around 5½ month total . During study picture body fat store take use MRI scanner , biopsy/sample tummy fat take look fat cell physical fitness body metabolism ( way body deal sugar , insulin fat ) measure . These measurement do three different time : gaining weight , weight gain , lose weight ( back original weight ) . The measurement give detailed assessment change body gain lose weight . The benefit take part study receive detailed feedback fitness level , body fat , dietary intake , blood pressure , cholesterol , blood sugar level `` insulin resistance '' . Feedback overall study finding also provide . In addition , knowledge gain participation may benefit people risk diabetes future increase understanding South Asians increase risk develop diabetes . It also help guide future research investigate reduce increase risk lifestyle change may also help direct development medicine prevent treat diabetes group increase risk disease . Possible disadvantage study gain 7 % body weight 4-6 week . This likely temporarily induce negative metabolic change . However , investigator also support lose weight ( hopefully ) weight loss phase study . There evidence short-term weight gain nature cause long-term adverse effect . Longer-term weight gain however associate increase risk diabetes , cardiovascular disease high blood pressure . It therefore important investigator ensure participant return original weight start study . Taking fat biopsy carry small risk minor bruising infection . Good sterile practice reduces risk infection application ice pressure biopsy site reduces risk bruising . Blood sample via cannula may cause minor bruise inflammation vein . Some participant may feel faint give blood . One exercise test maximal level possibility exist , occasionally , certain change may occur shortly test . They include abnormal blood pressure , faint change normal rhythm heartbeat . There small possibility take part study reveal health problem patient already high cholesterol high blood pressure . If problem reveal , investigator ask permission inform participant 's General Practitioner receive clinically appropriate follow-up care . This study run ~2.5 year March 2015 base University Glasgow . The study fund European Commission part European Medical Information Framework ( EMIF ) , call EMIF-Metabolic . This research help investigator well predict likely risk develop disease diabetes develop new medicine prevent treat disease .

Exclusion criterion include diabetes ( physician diagnose HbA1c ≥6.5 % screen ) , history cardiovascular disease , regular participation vigorous physical activity , current smoking , take drug supplement think affect carbohydrate lipid metabolism , significant illness would prevent full participation study .</criteria>
