	<detailed_description>Lymph node metastasis one important prognostic-factors head neck cancer ( HNC ) . Radical neck dissection ( RND ) standard surgical method HNC neck lymph node metastasis past decade . This operation include removal sternocleidomastoid muscle ( SCM ) , internal jugular vein ( IJV ) cervical lymph node one side spinal accessory nerve ( SAN ) , lead significant ipsilateral shoulder syndrome cause SAN dysfunction impact quality life . Despite clinic prefer use nerve-sparing selective neck dissection ( SND ) patient N0 N1 nodal disease today , shoulder disability pain still report 31 % 40 % procedure . However , previous study evaluate shoulder disability functional evaluation , range motion , questionnaire . The short long term adverse effect soft tissue around shoulder girdle SND report . The investigator suppose : 1 . SND may cause damage soft tissue around shoulder girdle . 2 . The soft tissue injury may relate order severity wing scapula duration SND . The aim study : 1 . To assess functional disability shoulder upper extremity different time period SND . 2 . To evaluate soft tissue lesion shoulder soft tissue ultrasonography prove hypothesis . This study two year , prospective , cross-section study . The investigator enroll 80 HNC post SND within 3months , &gt; 3- 6months , &gt; 6months -1 year , 1 year four different group , 20 patient group . Evaluate soft tissue shoulder girdle musculoskeletal ultrasonography elastography , compare find group range motion shoulder , severity wing scapula , visual pain analog scale score The Disability Arm , Shoulder Hand ( DASH ) questionnaire . Statistical analysis perform SPSS software ( SPSS V 20. International Business Machines . USA ) .</detailed_description>
