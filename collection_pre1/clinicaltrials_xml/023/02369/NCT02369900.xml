	<brief_title>Esmolol Treat Hemodynamic Effects Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Septic shock lead cause death around world , mortality often range 30-50 % location may even high . Despite advance critical care medicine last several decade , therapeutic intervention demonstrate mortality benefit population besides antimicrobial medication , intravenous fluid , control source infection ; multiple agent one time show promise ultimately fail deliver meaningful clinical benefit . As , ongoing need identify therapeutic intervention modify course disease patient . Septic shock traditionally characterize hyperdynamic hemodynamic profile high cardiac output ( CO ) low systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) association excessive catecholamine stimulation . Tachycardia common find septic shock early compensatory mechanism increase cardiac output set low SVR . Often tachycardia persists beyond initial stage septic shock , associate restrict diastolic ventricular filling , increase oxygen requirement , tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy , well myocardial depression , immunosuppression , direct myocyte toxicity via calcium overload . Generally , clinical practice avoid try control tachycardic response fear worsen cardiac output cause cardiovascular collapse . However , recent single center randomize trial intravenous beta-1 adrenoreceptor antagonist esmolol demonstrate control heart rate 'normal ' range safe , well-tolerated , appear beneficial , 30 % reduction mortality find trial . While intrigue concept result appear promising , investigation among ICU cohort United States necessary administration beta-blockade therapy patient septic shock implement routine clinical practice . We hypothesize provision esmolol patient vasopressor-dependent septic shock tachycardia low heart rate , thereby improve diastolic filling time improve cardiac output , result reduction need vasopressor support . To test hypothesis , conduct Phase II randomize trial determine esmolol decrease vasopressor requirement ( primary endpoint ) alter inflammatory cascade well oxygen consumption patient septic shock ( secondary endpoint ) .</detailed_description>
