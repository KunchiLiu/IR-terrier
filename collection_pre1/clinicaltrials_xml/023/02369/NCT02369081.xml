	<brief_summary>This study recommend NICE , part 2006 guidance treatment hypertension , urgently require provide evidence treatment recommendation patient resistant hypertension . The study randomise placebo-controlled double-blind crossover comparison α-blocker ( α ) , β-blocker ( β ) , K+-sparing diuretic ( ∆ ) . Patients BP entry target ABPM home monitoring despite supervised administration maximum tolerate dos A+C+D . Over 48 week receive , random order either placebo two dos doxazosin ( α ) , bisoprolol ( β ) spironolactone ( ∆ ) . Each treatment cycle last 12 week , force dose-doubling 6 week . The time course study similar study one . 340 patient provide 90 % power , α=0.01 detect 3 mmHg overall difference home sBP one drug placebo , spironolactone hypothesize best overall . The study able detect 6 mmHg difference sBP subject 's best second-best drug predict tertile plasma renin , justify routine use measurement patient resistant hypertension .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In publish survey throughout world majority patient hypertension achieve target blood pressure . According guideline include NICE , target blood pressure 130/80 mmHg patient diabetes , 140/90 mmHg patient . In UK currently least 3 million people treated hypertension whose blood pressure control . A significant number patient drug resistant hypertension , define : `` blood pressure adequately control recommended treatment target despite treatment maximal recommend tolerated dos 3 drug accord current BHS/NICE guideline treatment algorithm , i.e . ( *ACE-inhibitor *ARB direct renin inhibitor + *CCB + Diuretic ( diuretic except spironolactone ) , i.e . A+C+D ) '' . ( *where ACE-inhibitor=angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor , ARB=angiotensin receptor blocker , CCB=calcium channel blocker ) The cause treatment resistance unknown , choice fourth-line drug almost entirely empirical . At present little comparative data available drug . There considerable evidence point Na+ retention common culprit , data support additional diuretic , alpha blockade resistant hypertension , though mainly add two rather three drugs.20,29,30 A retrospective analysis two-drug combination trial report make difference combine . 31 However , conclusion conflict view drug hypertension fall two main category , act respectively renin volume component hypertension , benefit derive combine drug different categories.10,32 Despite successful adoption BHS/NICE treatment algorithm treatment hypertension , remain substantial clinical uncertainty prefer clinical management people drug resistant hypertension . This important question patient high risk cardiovascular event . The current guideline acknowledge currently adequate clinical trial evidence upon base recommendation prefer 4th line drug treatment resistant hypertension . It possible make difference drug add fourth-line treatment response , average , class . Alternatively , also possible one class drug always superior others mechanism underpin resistant hypertension common patient . In regard , popular view resistant hypertension invariably due excessive sodium retention thus `` diuretic therapy '' always effective treatment . A third possibility resistant hypertension heterogeneous state study average response cohorts clinical study mask substantial individual patient difference . With regard , study address hypothesis renin status patient defines response 4th line treatment resistant hypertension , i.e . low renin predict sodium retention best response diuretic therapy , whereas high renin predicts well response drug suppress renin , i.e . β-blocker . Hypothesis Novel Aspects Trial The primary hypothesis study commonest cause resistant hypertension excessive Na+-retention , diuretic therapy ( spironolactone use study ) superior potential `` add-on drug '' people inadequate blood pressure control despite treatment optimal high tolerated dos three drug class recommend BHS/NICE treatment algorithm , i.e . A+C+D . The main secondary objective use plasma renin measurement evaluate ' α , β , ∆ ' rule selection 4th line drug patient drug resistant hypertension - α represent α-blockade , β represent β-blockade ∆ represent `` diuretic therapy '' cite . The main secondary hypothesis state plasma renin ( measure background 3 drug , i.e . A+C+D ) , predict effective 4th line drug . We propose : α-blockade effective 4th line drug lower BP patient mid-tertile plasma renin , expect ≥20mU/L &lt; 100mU/L ; β-blockade effective drug renin top tertile ( expect ≥100Mu/L ) drug block renin secretion ; Further diuretic therapy spironolactone effective plasma renin low tertile ( expect &lt; 20mU/L ) , indicative excessive sodium retention . The study also evaluate whether routine use plasma renin predict best treatment individual patient resistant hypertension cost-effective use diuretic therapy indiscriminately prefer 4th line drug patient . Finally study investigate whether non-invasive assessment haemodynamic parameter indicative sodium retention volume status , i.e . cardiac output , peripheral resistance bioimpedance , use predict response drug α , β , ∆ sequence .</detailed_description>
