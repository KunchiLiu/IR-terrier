	<brief_summary>This randomize , blind , parallel-group trial evaluate efficacy safety Nifurtimox ( NFX ) Benznidazole ( BZN ) , two usual intervention treat parasite Trypanosoma cruzi . The investigator test whether NFX effective trypanocidal agent ( comparison placebo ) equivalent BZN ( active comparator ) term parasite-related safety outcome . Individuals find seropositive without clinical sign dilate cardiomyopathy receive either active treatment match placebo . Participants allocate NFX BZN receive either 60-day ( full-dose ) 120-day ( half-dose ) active treatment , whereas control group receive placebo 120 day . There thus four arm active treatment ( NFX60 , NFX120 , BZN60 BZN120 ) , fifth control arm receiving placebo ( 1:1:1:1:1 allocation ratio ) every participant trial take 120 day study drug ( group receive full-dose complete 120-day mask treatment placebo ) . The study plan enroll 500 participant Colombia ( two different geographical area ) Argentina , order explore regional difference treatment effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim multi-center randomized trial include : 1 . To evaluate feasibility conduct multinational trial term 1. ability identify recruit T. cruzi-infected individual without clinical disease relatively short period 2. standardization procedure test parasitic load use polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) 2 . To evaluate , study population , efficacy treatment NFX use conventional ( full ) dose ( 8/mg/Kg/day ) half-dose variable duration ( full-dose 60 day versus half-dose 120 day ) term presence positive PCR test one year treatment , compare placebo . 3 . To evaluate equivalence ( term non-inferiority impact PCR test ) two treatment schedule NFX : full-dose treatment 60 day half-dose treatment 120 day . 4 . To evaluate equivalence two treatment schedule BZN : A conventional ( full ) dose 5 mg/Kg/day ) 60 day , compare half-dose treatment 120 day . 5 . To evaluate equivalence treatment schedule NFX compare BZN 5 6 . To evaluate safety ( term report mild symptom , limitation daily activity hospitalization , biochemical blood abnormality commonly report individual take treatment ) adherence allocate treatment among individual receive NFX BZN vary duration dose , compare placebo 7 . To explore difference impact active treatment PCR among four subgroup interest ( geographical origin , T. cruzi discrete type unit find , parasitic load baseline age participant ) . 8 . To explore , among individual treat placebo , level agreement test parasitic load baseline follow .</detailed_description>
