	<brief_summary>This pilot study design follow previous , preliminary study test long-term safety feasibility implantation autologous peripheral nerve graft substantia nigra par compacta ( SNpc ) basal nucleus Meynert ( NBM ) basal forebrain participant PD undergo deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) surgery . Peripheral nerve tissue contain Schwann cell produce growth factor demonstrate support survival function neuron . Participants serve donor tissue , implanted time undergo DBS surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cont . Study Evaluate Implanting Peripheral Nerve Grafts Into Subjects With Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) During DBS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective pilot study demonstrate safety approach : introducing minor modification standard , FDA approve neurosurgical procedure use decade implant autologous peripheral nerve central nervous system . As , study design pose minimal risk minimal inconvenience subject . Additionally , test paradigm perform strategically interfere surgery delivery schedule clinical DBS therapy . The scientific basis study implant peripheral nerve tissue naturally well suit provide multiple growth factor show experimentally support survival function dopaminergic neuron . Central proposal hypothesis implant tissue physiologically deliver growth factor restore normal function afflict neuron find PD . The first specific aim assess feasibility safety combine peripheral nerve graft/DBS surgical procedure . The second specific aim evaluate long term clinical safety peripheral nerve implant . This pilot study provide safety data use generate large phase III clinical trial . If successful , would herald development new treatment PD patient able provide tissue source growth factor could arrest reverse ongoing cellular loss responsible devastating dysfunction .</detailed_description>
