	<brief_summary>Ureteral calculus , commonly know kidney stone , frequent cause Emergency Department ( ED ) visit . These stone get catch ureter ( tube connect kidney bladder ) cause symptom include pain , nausea , vomit . As long obstruct stone meet certain condition patient n't sick , patient usually send home try pas stone without surgery . This treatment know medical expulsive therapy ( MET ) , routinely involve use drug call tamsulosin , relax smooth muscle urinary system help stone pas . Silodosin drug class tamsulosin , think selective action quicker onset , would theoretically make good aid kidney stone passage . The purpose study head-to-head , blind comparison two drug see quickly result stone passage . Subjects patient present ED acute kidney stone show CT scan , appropriate MET . The main study intervention randomization receive either tamsulosin silodosin . The hypothesis silodosin decrease time stone passage compare tamsulosin . Subjects qualify consent randomize two-week course either silodosin tamsulosin . They also give prescription standard care medication pain nausea , well pain diary . They receive follow-up phone call one week remind follow-up appointment , ask adverse event , determine stone pass . They follow-up visit study staff end two week treatment collect pain diary , pill count , adverse event , determine stone pass . Study participation end follow-up visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Procedures Involved Research . This study prospective , randomize , double-blinded , head-to-head trial compare two medication . Patients symptoms renal colic present emergency department evaluate ED staff per usual routine . After work-up ( include routine chemistry , complete blood count , urine analysis , urine culture , non-contrast CT scan abdomen pelvis ) complete , patient meet inclusion criterion ask whether willing enroll study . Those unsuitable study unwilling participate continue receive routine care ureteral calculus . Those consent enrol subject study , give 2-week supply either tamsulosin silodosin blind bottle appropriate dosing instruction . The prescription dispense pharmacy ; therefore subject study staff blind prescription subject receives . Randomization do advance key make correlate subject enrollment number prescription receive . Throughout study , study staff make effort ascertain medication subject give , unless adverse event suspect . Each participant give information card detail two possible medication take , present physician need . Subjects discharge home per routine care instruction drink plenty fluid , give strainer ask attempt catch ureteral calculus . They also give standardized prescription analgesic package ( Percocet 5/325mg # 20 , Motrin 600mg # 60 , Zofran OD 4mg # 20 standard dose instruction ) Visual Analog Pain Scale diary fill daily . Subjects give standardized discharge instruction per standard care include indication immediate ED return sign symptom infection MET failure ( fever , worsen pain , vomiting , lethargy , unsteadiness , syncope inability tolerate oral pain medication ) . As per standard care , instruct return ER immediately develop symptom . Finally , subject 's contact information collect time enrollment follow-up appointment schedule Urology 4 week ensure get appropriate timely specialty follow-up . This follow-up also standard care , occur subject 's participation study end . Each subject schedule return ER 2 week see research staff data collection . They ask bring pill bottle visual analog pain scale diary visit . If subject report pass stone consistent initial imaging , resolution pain suggest pass stone unseen , conclude participation study . However , still symptom , case categorize outpatient treatment failure subject register see ER Physician Urology consult order , conclude participation study . This current standard care , cover insurance . Any subject unscheduled visit ER ureterolithiasis-related complaint also consider outpatient treatment failure . This also conclude participation study . To ensure follow-up , subject call one week enrollment . They remind 2-week follow-up appointment need bring pill bottle . Each subject also ask pass stone resolution pain . The reminded must follow-up even long symptom .</detailed_description>
