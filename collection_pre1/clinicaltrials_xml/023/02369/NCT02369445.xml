	<brief_title>Investigation Teacher-Mediated Toilet Training Using Manualized Moisture Alarm Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal propose study develop teacher-mediated model toileting instruction child ASD school setting incorporate innovative manualized moisture pager intervention ( i.e. , MP intervention ) conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare efficacy MP intervention standard behavioral treatment ( SBT ) . The specific aim related hypothesis propose study : Aim 1 : To prepare teacher-mediated moisture pager ( MP ) intervention large-scale test classroom setting modify current parent manual classroom use evaluate feasibility study protocol . Hypothesis 1 . The study protocol feasible , indicated achievement recruitment target , successful randomization , 80 % retention participate classroom staff child ASD complete data collection . Hypothesis 2 . Teachers deliver MP standard behavioral treatment ( SBT ) intervention &gt; 80 % fidelity ( rat teacher train fidelity checklist ) , teacher MP SBT intervention group adhere intervention &gt; 80 % fidelity ( rat treatment fidelity checklist ) . Hypothesis 3 . Teachers participate MP group report great satisfaction MP toilet train experience teacher participate SBT group , base teacher satisfaction survey . Aim 2 : To compare efficacy MP intervention SBT conduct RCT ( N= 30 classroom total 60 child ASD age 3 - 10 year ) . Hypothesis 4 . At close 3-month intervention period , child MP group few toileting accident higher rate toilet use urination child SBT group , base data collect teacher pen-and-paper toileting data log . Hypothesis 5 . At 3 month follow close intervention , teacher MP group report few toileting accident higher rate toileting success child SBT group , indicate completion toileting data log 3 consecutive day .</detailed_description>
