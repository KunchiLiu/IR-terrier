	<detailed_description>The project investigate early treatment acute stroke motor relearning , reduce ankle passive active impairment improve balance mobility/locomotion function . This double-blind randomized control clinical trial patient therapists assess outcomes blind group assignment . The trial conduct two group acute stroke survivor randomly allocate receive ( 1 ) Intensive robot-aided feedback-aided motor relearning , stretch reduce joint spasticity/stiffness provide sensory stimulation , robot-guided active movement training engage movement game play audiovisual haptic feedback ( Study group ) , ( 2 ) Passive movement middle ROM active movement training without robotic guidance/feedback ( Control group ) , 5 session per week 3 week patient ' hospital stay neurology rehabilitation service . For study group , impair joint stretch forcefully intelligent control stretch slow increase resistance stop specify peak resistance torque reach . The joint hold extreme range motion ( ROM ) allow stress relaxation occur . The stretching also provide sensory stimulation patient ask feel stretch track joint position facilitate sensory recovery . Following stretching , active movement training conduct engage patient motivate video game limb undergo movement train real-time audiovisual haptic feedback . The participant play game beyond current active range motion robot provide assistance play within active ROM robot provide resistance improve motor control . Both group use wearable ankle rehabilitation robot group also receive standard care hospital rehabilitation service . Carry-over effect evaluate one month treatment end . Aim 1 : To evaluate biomechanical neuromuscular change define passive active ROMs , flexor-extensor muscle strength , joint stiffness , proprioception reflex excitability compare measure two group . The biomechanical neuromuscular outcome measure obtain blind assessment evaluate train use wearable rehabilitation robot . Hypothesis 1 : Robot-guided motor relearning , stretch active movement training ( study group ) improve biomechanical neuromuscular outcome measure control group . Aim 2 : To evaluate clinical outcome measure define Fugl-Meyer score ( low extremity ) , modify Ashworth scale , Berg balance scale , 10 walk test , 6 min walk test ( 6MWT ) , Timed-Up-and-Go test , compare Study Control group . Hypothesis 2 : The study group improve clinical outcome measure ( F-M , MAS , balance , gait ) control group .</detailed_description>
