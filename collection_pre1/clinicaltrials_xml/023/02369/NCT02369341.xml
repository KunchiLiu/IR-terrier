	<criteria>Subjects , opinion investigator , comply requirement protocol . Written inform consent obtain subject prior perform study specific procedure . A male female age 18 year time vaccination . Healthy subject wellcontrolled chronic disease establish medical history clinical examination enter study . Female subject nonchildbearing potential may enrol study . Female subject childbearing potential may enrol study , subject : practiced adequate contraception 30 day prior vaccination , negative pregnancy test day vaccination agree continue adequate contraception entire treatment period 2 month completion vaccination series . Use investigational nonregistered product ( drug vaccine ) study vaccine period start 30 day dose study vaccine ( Day 29 Day 0 ) , plan use study period . Any medical condition judgment investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe . Chronic administration ( defined 14 day total ) immunosuppressant immunemodifying drug period start six month prior vaccine dose . For corticosteroid , mean prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day , equivalent . Inhaled topical steroid allow . Administration longacting immunemodifying drug ( e.g . rituximab , infliximab , etc . ) within 6 month study start , plan administration study . Planned administration/administration vaccine foreseen study protocol period start 30 day study vaccination entire study period . Administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product period start 3 month first dose study vaccine plan administration study period . Administration influenza vaccine within 6 month precede study start plan use vaccine study period.. Concurrently participate another clinical study , time study period , subject expose investigational noninvestigational vaccine/product ( pharmaceutical product device ) . Clinically virologically confirm influenza infection within six month precede study vaccination . Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition , base medical history physical examination ( laboratory testing require ) . Acute disease and/or fever time enrolment . Fever define temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F , measure mean . Subjects minor illness ( mild diarrhoea , mild upper respiratory infection ) without fever may , enrol discretion investigator . Acute chronic , clinically significant pulmonary , cardiovascular , hepatic renal functional abnormality , determine physical examination laboratory screen test . Chronic underlying disease ( cancer , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease oxygen therapy , insulindependent diabetes mellitus ) , stabilise clinically serious . History chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse deem investigator render potential subject unable/unlikely provide accurate safety report . History GuillainBarré syndrome . History reaction hypersensitivity likely exacerbate component vaccine , include latex . History severe adverse reaction previous influenza vaccination . Anaphylaxis follow administration vaccine ( ) . Pregnant lactate female . Female plan become pregnant planning discontinue contraceptive precaution .</criteria>
