	<brief_summary>During past decade , simulation-based training become essential make trainee fit clinical practice . Traditionally , trainee instruct practice error possible simulation-based training . However , recent evidence field psychology suggest transfer learning may improve trainee encourage commit error train . The aim study ass performance real patient effect error-management instruction compare error-avoidance instruction simulation-based virtual reality ultrasound training . This study plan randomize control trial . Participants include medical student prior simulation practice fifth sixth year medical school . All participant receive 3 hour simulation-based ultrasound training focus fetal weight estimation . The participant ( N=60 ) randomize two group : Participants group 1 instruct follow simulator program step-by-step achieve high possible simulator metric score make error possible . Participants group 2 instructed experiment explore deliberately make error train . A simulation-based pre- post-test administer training . Participants schedule perform transfer test seven ten day simulation training . The transfer test consist fetal weight estimation real patient . The primary outcome weight deviation participant measurement compare expert finding . Secondary outcome include performance assessment pre- , post- transfer test performance blind ultrasound expert use Objective Structured Assessment Ultrasound Skills ( OSAUS ) scale . Using alpha level 0.05 , effect size 0.80 , power 0.80 , 25 participant need two study group . Loss follow-up 20 % study participant anticipate , result 30 participant study group .</brief_summary>
