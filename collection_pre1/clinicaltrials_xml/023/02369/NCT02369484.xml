	<brief_title>Afatinib NSCLC With HER2 Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous clinical study NSCLC show patient tumor harbor specific gene mutation ( change ) epithelial growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) show good result treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , like afatinib ( tradename Giotrif® ) , compare classical treatment chemotherapy . The treatment TKI become new standard-of-care patient advance lung cancer EGFR ALK change . Several novel mutation , candidate target specific medication discover . Human epidermal growth factor 2 ( HER2 , erbB-2/neu ) protein call ErbB family ( include HER2 [ ErbB2 ] , ErbB3 ErbB4 ) . These protein involve growth spread cancer cell . Mutations HER2 find 2 % NSCLC . Afatinib work block activity ErbB family proteins inhibit growth spread cancer cell . Afatinib approve European Swiss Medicines Agencies treatment adult patient specific type cancer lung ( non-small cell lung cancer ) identify change ( mutation ) gene EGFR first treatment prior chemotherapy treatment insufficient . A total 22 patient center around Europe expect enrolled study period 24 month . All patient treat way . The study take approximately 40 month complete . This clinical trial conduct accord applicable national law international guideline .</detailed_description>

Women childbearing potential ( &lt; 1 year without menstruation &lt; 2 year without menstruation follow chemotherapy ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day begin trial treatment . Sexually active men woman childbearing potential must use effective contraceptive method ( two barrier method barrier method plus hormonal method ) trial treatment period least 28 day follow last administration trial drug . Recovered previous therapy relate toxicity ≤Grade 1 date enrolment ( except recovery ≤Grade 2 alopecia , fatigue , creatinine increase , lack appetite well stable sensory neuropathy ) Written Informed Consent ( IC ) trial treatment must sign dated patient investigator prior trialrelated intervention . Tumour block available central review HER2 mutation status . Patient mixed smallcell nonsmallcell histologic feature Uncontrolled leptomeningeal metastatic disease . Radiotherapytreated asymptomatic brain metastasis allow ( systematic screening ) . Patients brain subdural metastasis eligible , unless complete local therapy discontinue use corticosteroid stable dose corticosteroid least 4 week start trial treatment . Any symptom attribute brain metastasis must stable least 4 week date enrolment . Previous treatment HER2 target antibody tyrosine kinase inhibitor include afatinib . Major surgery within 4 week start trial treatment schedule surgery project course trial . Patient past 3 year previous concomitant malignancy EXCEPT adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ carcinoma cervix bladder , situ ductal carcinoma breast . History presence clinically relevant cardiovascular abnormality uncontrolled hypertension , congestive heart failure NYHA classification III IV ( see Table 2 ) , unstable angina poorly control arrhythmia determine investigator . Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrolment .
