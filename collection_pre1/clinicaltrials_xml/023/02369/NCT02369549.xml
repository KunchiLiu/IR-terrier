	<brief_summary>An investigator initiate pilot trial : two arm , double blind , placebo control , randomize , parallel group approximately 750 patient chronic kidney disease , evidence overt proteinuria , treat micro-particle curcumin versus placebo 24 week start investigational medication date ( approximately 6 month ) test whether curcumin slow chronic kidney disease progression patient . Three 30 mg capsule micro-particle curcumin self-administered daily morning determine safety efficacy curcumin relative placebo reduce albuminuria , reduce urinary interleukin-18 slowing loss eGFR .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Micro-Particle Curcumin Treatment Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Limiting progression CKD end-stage renal disease one important goal kidney medicine . The evidence implicate inflammation fibrosis process strong , abundant mechanistic animal model data show curcumin potent inhibitor inflammation fibrosis . Two preliminary randomize trial human CKD hint curcumin 's enormous therapeutic potential CKD . The Principal Investigator/Sponsor rigorously test potential broadly select sample 750 patient CKD . Compared previous study , study 's result generalizable across etiology CKD large sample size ; study provide precise estimate curcumin 's benefit risk . Also , study proposes use new , micro-particle formulation curcumin highly bioavailable . The Principal Investigator/Sponsor ass curcumin 's effect three key marker kidney health encompass cardinal function nephron . Positive result MPAC-CKD lay solid scientific ground-work multi-centre trial capable test micro-particle curcumin 's effect meaningful outcome : death development end-stage renal disease . To ensure study necessary adherence tolerability data , 750 patient proteinuric CKD randomly assign 90 mg per day micro-particle curcumin match placebo , total 24 week ( approximately 6 month ) . In last year , new formulation curcumin show substantially augment absorption improve aqueous solubility . The micro-particle formulation curcumin one new formulation curcumin delivery system proven increase bioavailability . Compared traditional curcumin , micro-particle curcumin achieves total serum concentration 27 fold high . In study , micro-particle curcumin allow study team administer equivalent 3000 mg traditional curcumin ( would require six 500 mg capsule daily ) , single 90 mg capsule . In addition , oppose traditional curcumin , requirement take micro-particle curcumin full stomach . The Investigator/Sponsor select dose equivalent 3 gram per day curcumin within range dos prove safe effective minimize pill burden allow full daily dose achieve three small 30 mg capsule daily In rare case , curcumin report cause minor nausea , headache , diarrhea , yellow stool , temporary giddiness . All unexpected reaction report previous study easily manage happen high dos use MPAC-CKD . This study assess three co-primary outcome baseline , 12 week ( approximately 3 month ) 24 week ( approximately 6 month ) date start investigational medication : albuminuria , eGFR , urinary interleukin-18 . Glycemic control assess baseline , 12 week ( approximately 3 month ) 24 week ( approximately 6 month ) date start investigational medication , among patient diabetes mellitus . Medical history , lab value vitals collect and/or update in-person visit . Each participant provide instruction study schedule . Participants diabetes mellitus give home glucose log-book . Protocol compliance test pill count interview follow-up visit . Side effect assess use standardized case report form visit . Participants contact telephone one week trial every 4 week ( monthly ) 28 week ( approximately 7 month ) safety monitor report reinforce importance compliance . In-person visit occur 12 24 week ( approximately 3 6 month ) randomization start investigational medication , time investigational medication count supply replenished . First morning at-home urine specimen collect baseline arrange in-person visit 12 24 week ( approximately 3 6 month ) . Participants also encourage report event may experience directly coordinator ( ) and/or PI . Participants withdraw consent continue treatment , encourage undergo planned assessment . Withdrawal request investigator medical personnel may include , limited : 1 . Symptoms deem potentially related sue investigational medication ; 2 . New diagnosis exclusion criterion ; 3 . Inter-current illness relate use investigational Natural Health Product ( NHP ) medication ; 4 . Unacceptable side effect ; 5 . Death ; 6 . Improved health status . Estimated time complete recruitment : Averaging 136 week , approximately 34 month . Long-term outcome track use administrative data house The Institute Clinical Evaluative Sciences ( ICES ) , independent research facility Toronto , Ontario . ICES work Ontario Ministry Health Long-Term Care study impact health care diseases Ontario . A panel external expert study investigator comprise Steering Committee ensure integrity study . They responsible review act upon recommendation Data Safety Monitoring Board , amendments protocol , oversight publication dissemination study result . Additional analysis : The first 30 consent randomized participant , 4.5 ml blood sample take 12 week ( 3 month ) visit . This sample process stored -80 degree C. batch test plasma micro-particle curcumin concentration . Two urine specimen obtain day home collection baseline , 12 24 week ( average 3 6 month ) process store -80 degree C batch analysis IL-18 uncorrected urinary creatinine concentration ( primary outcome # 3 ) . Specimens store Kidney Clinical Research Unit , London , Ontario ship analysis Yale University , New Haven , Connecticut , USA .</detailed_description>
