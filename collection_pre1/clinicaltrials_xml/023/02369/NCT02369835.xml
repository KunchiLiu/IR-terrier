	<brief_title>Modified Dakin 's Solution Reducing Radiation-Induced Dermatitis Patients With Head Neck Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine proportion patient develop grade 3 radiation dermatitis ( define Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System ) adverse effect radiation therapy chemoradiation therapy head neck cancer initiating use prophylactic hypochlorite ( HOCl ) ( modify Dakin 's solution ) start therapy ( experimental arm ) compare placebo ( control arm ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Time development grade 3 radiation dermatitis . II . Quality-of-life pain level ( assess Modified Brief Pain Inventory ) control arm versus experimental arm . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I ( EXPERIMENTAL ) : Patients apply modified Dakin 's solution topically skin irradiated 10 minute within 3 hour radiation treatment . ARM II ( CONTROL ) : Patients apply placebo solution topically skin irradiated 10 minute within 3 hour radiation treatment . After completion study , patient follow 6-10 week .</detailed_description>
