	<brief_title>MesomiR 1 : A Phase I Study TargomiRs 2nd 3rd Line Treatment Patients With Recurrent MPM NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TargomiRs target minicells contain microRNA mimic . They consist three component : 1 . A miR-16-based microRNA mimic . The miR-16 family implicate tumour suppressor range cancer type . The mimic double-stranded , 23 base pair , synthetic RNA molecule . 2 . Drug delivery vehicle - EDVs . EDVs nonliving bacterial minicells ( nanoparticles ) . They function leak resistant micro-reservoir carrier allow efficient packaging range different drug , protein nucleic acid . 3 . Targeting moiety . The EDVs target EGFR-expressing cancer cell anti-EGFR bispecific antibody . TargomiRs IV inject . Phase 1 Planned dose level Dose level 1 : 5 billion week Dose level 2 : 5 billion twice week Dose level 3 : 5 billion week cardiac monitoring Dose level 4 : 2.5 billion twice week cardiac monitoring Dose level 5 : additional dexamethasone challenge All patient begin micro dose 1 billion week escalate full phase 1 dose dose level week 3 . Duration treatment dose level patient patient basis . Officially cycle 8 week long however patient continue treatment derive clinical benefit treatment . If time point 8 week mark , patient progress , experience ongoing unreasonable toxicity withdraw study , cease treatment . Escalation dose cohort 3-6 patient per dose level . If least 2 patient observed experience Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) , prior dose level define MTD . Adherence protocol tend problematic patient group trial treatment treatment option . They often keen participate motivated part research .</detailed_description>
