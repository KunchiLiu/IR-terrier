	<brief_title>Study MEDI4736 Monotherapy Combination With Tremelimumab Versus Standard Care Therapy Patients With Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , multi-center , global , Phase III study determine efficacy safety MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC therapy target patient population . The main objective study : - ass efficacy MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) , term overall survival ( OS ) , regardless PDL-1 status - ass efficacy MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SOC patient SCCHN , term OS , regardless PDL-1 status Patients undergo screen assessment tumor tissue sample determine PD-L1 expression per pre-specified cut-off level . Patients ≥25 % tumor cell membrane stain consider PD-L1 positive 0 % 24 % tumor cell membrane stain consider PD-L1 negative . Based underlying PD-L1 status , patient randomize 1:1:1 ratio receive treatment MEDI4736 monotherapy , MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy , SoC therapy . Patients discontinue treatment 1 treatment group may switch treatment different group . Stratification factor include PD-L1 status , human papillomavirus status , ( patient oropharyngeal cancer ) , smoke status . Tumor assessment perform every 8 week objective tumor response Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors version 1.1 ( RECIST 1.1 ) .</detailed_description>
