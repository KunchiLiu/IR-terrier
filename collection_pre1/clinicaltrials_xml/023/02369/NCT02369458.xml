	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm incurable HNSCC oral cavity , oropharynx , larynx , hypopharynx , and/or Level 13 neck node noncutaneous SCC unknown primary . `` Incurable '' define metastatic disease local regional recurrence previously irradiate site unresectable ( patient decline resection ) . Progression follow platin , 5FU , cetuximab taxane give incurable disease . Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 10 mm CT scan , ≥ 20 mm chest xray , ≥ 10 mm caliper clinical exam per RECIST 1.1 . Tissue available ( either initial diagnostic recurrent tissue specimen ) p16 test . At least 18 year age . ECOG performance status ≤ 3 Adequate hematologic , renal , hepatic function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcl Platelets ≥ 75,000/mcl Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN , unless bone metastasis present absence liver metastasis Creatinine ULN ( male 0.71.30 mg/dl ; females 0.61.10 mg/dl ) OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Availability diagnostic tumor tissue specimens correlative study . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 1 month complete treatment . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . Other active malignancy exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection , carcinoma situ cervix , synchronous H &amp; N primary . Currently receive investigational agent . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Patient must negative pregnancy test within 7 day start study treatment . Known active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 28 day prior treatment . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition mitomycin C agent use study . Known HIVpositivity combination antiretroviral therapy potential pharmacokinetic interaction study drug . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy .
