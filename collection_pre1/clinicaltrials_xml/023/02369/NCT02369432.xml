	<brief_title>Exploratory Study Cutaneous Penetration Biodegradable Polymeric Microparticles Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment inflammatory skin disorder acne , psoriasis atopic dermatitis primarily topical . They advantage allow administration active substance directly skin lesion . However local treatment may drawbacks ( complex application , local and/or systemic side effect ... ) cause poor compliance . The use drug carrier view one promising strategy target control release active substance various skin site . Polymeric microparticles show well stability sustain release pattern type drug vehicle liposomes . Based result obtain preclinical experiment , proof concept study aim assess , patient suffer atopic dermatitis , biodegradable polymeric microparticles reach pilosebaceous follicle inflame skin would turn serve reservoir active substance .</detailed_description>
