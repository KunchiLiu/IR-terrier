	<brief_title>Early Infant HIV Treatment Botswana</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-1 infection adulthood lead stable , long-lasting viral reservoir CD4 T cell persist despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , responsible rapid viral rebound treatment stop case . In neonate , HIV-1 infection occur time adaptive immune system still development , may alter establishment long-lasting viral reservoir offer opportunities reduce viral persistence early antiretroviral treatment . Recently , scientific understanding neonatal HIV infection challenge description infant test positive HIV birth , treat potent combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) within first 30 hour life , achieve long-term remission HIV infection ART stop approximately 18 month later . Unfortunately , 2 year ART , rebound viremia occur child , yet case raise provocative question whether ART initiate within first day life antepartum infection , first days/weeks life peripartum infection , prevent seed long-lasting reservoir HIV infect cell infant ( therefore lead long period HIV remission ART ) .</detailed_description>

Blood sample collect submit realtime safety lab evaluation ; result may pending time entry . At least half infant antepartum cohort must &lt; 3 day enrollment , include 3 first 6 infant enrol . Inclusion Criteria ( peripartum infection cohort ) : 1 . Mother/guardian ≥18 year age able provide inform consent 2 . Age great 4 day less 57 day 3 . HIVnegative within 96 hour birth NOTE : HIVnegative define HIVnegative DNA PCR single specimen HIVnegative 2 separate confirmatory specimen follow retest HIVpositive sample 4 .

Eligible ART Botswana government program 7 . Ability follow BHP clinic ART 192 week enrollment 8 . Blood sample collect submit realtime safety lab evaluation ( result may pending time entry ) . An enrolled infant later determine HIV uninfected confirmatory test end participation study enrollment count total number enrollment plan . Inclusion Criteria ( control group ) : 1 .

ART initiate within follow timeframe base time HIVinfection diagnosis 30365 day birth HIVinfection diagnose within 96 hour birth OR 57365 day birth infant HIVnegative base testing perform within 96 hour birth ( unknown HIV status &lt; 96 hour birth ) find HIVpositive base test perform 96 hour 42 day birth . 5 . After 6 month ART , document HIV RNA measurement &lt; 400 copies/mL Exclusion Criteria ( antepartum peripartum infection cohort ) : 1 . Hospitalization severe medical illness 2 . Medical condition make unlikely infant survive 96 week 3 . If lab value available prior enrollment , follow Division AIDS 2004 result , sample collect within 7 day prior entry without subsequent testing , exclude infant : Grade ≥3 ALT Grade ≥3 AST Grade ≥4 hemoglobin Note : Baseline lab value may available time ART start . However , soon value available ( occasionally within &lt; 24 hour ) , use make rapid treatment decision . Neonates baseline Grade 4 hemoglobin call immediately ZDV discontinue value confirm . Neonates baseline Grade 3 4 ALT AST call immediately stop either NVP LPV/r value confirm . Neonates remain ART may remain study . Neonates discontinue ART preART laboratory abnormality count total enrollment . Exclusion Criteria ( control group ) : 1 ) &lt; 85 % report adherence prescribed dose interruption ART 7 consecutive day since initiation .</criteria>
