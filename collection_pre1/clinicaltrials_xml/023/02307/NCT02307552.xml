	<brief_summary>This study perform verify ability use minimally invasive transurethral ultrasonic image technology purpose identify prostate cancer . Transurethral ultrasonic prostate imaging , may future , use detection monitor disease process minimize need obtain surgical biopsy specimen . The hypothesis tissue-density variation , reveal diagnostic ultrasonic imaging , result unique image signature identification prostate cancer . This imaging procedure provide multifaceted view entire in-situ gland . The current use Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) determine likelihood presence cancer prostate gland require interpretation good limited predict prostate cancer biopsy , significant false prediction rate . More importantly blood test , PSA test lack ability pinpoint location cancer within prostate gland . Preliminary study finding suggest `` Transurethral Ultrasonic Scanning '' ( TUUS ) present desire improved diagnostic sensitivity detection cancer within imaged prostate gland , intrinsic capability provide high resolution image transverse future three-dimensional view entire gland well currently use Transurethral Ultrasound ( TRUS ) . Two important goal practicality minimally invasive technology assess study . 1 . The ability TUUS directly detect prostate cancer location prostate . 2 . The use TUUS successfully guide prostate needle biopsy cancer loci high rate accuracy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Purpose Research The primary objective Institutional Review Board-controlled study determine presently manually-read result TUUS data obtain novel UreScan device correlate pathologist finding harvest prostate gland individual diagnose prostate disease . If successful , future Institutional Review Board study explore use computer software examine 256 transverse image slice large number prostate cancer patient establish clinical applicability TUUS screen assessment individual elevate level PSA and/or positive digital rectal examination ( DRE ) , potentially reduce number future biopsy examination false-positive finding . Background Information The current use Prostate Specific Antigen determine likelihood presence cancer prostate gland show seriously flaw . Multiple study review finding refer biopsy , base elevate PSA level , result many 70 % false positive finding cancer . Improved rapid , minimally-invasive , low-cost methodology technology develop provide diagnostic cancer finding higher sensitivity specificity objective goal present research . Preliminary study finding suggest `` Transurethral Ultrasonic Scanning '' ( TUUS ) present desire improved diagnostic sensitivity detection cancer within imaged prostate gland intrinsic capability provide high resolution image transverse future three-dimensional view entire gland . Two important goal minimally invasive technology assess study . 1 . The ability TUUS directly detect prostate cancer situ prostate . 2 . The use TUUS successfully guide prostate needle biopsy cancer loci high rate accuracy . In 2003 study Holmes et al , TUUS device test 2 patient seed implanted prostate cancer . TUUS reveal seed ( 82 % , 84 % ) standard TRUS ( 63 % , 65 % ) 2 patient . These simple case demonstrate feasibility provide transverse image entire prostate gland . Holmes postulated procedure would automate achieve clinical utility value project essentially abandon Mayo . The TUUS/ '' UreScan '' system marriage label usage FDA approve vascular probe , place inside standard foley catheter insert penis onto prostate neck bladder . The ultrasound probe travel length prostate ( ~4-8cm ) within sheath catheter image entire prostate ultrasound . The travel ultrasound probe control small motor drive outside catheter patient well . This motor drive probe offer possibility accurate reproducible ultrasound prostate , patient 's prostate apex use anchor point study . Refinements TUUS system include : 1 . A Foley type introducer use place intravascular ultrasound transducer prostatic urethral region image 2 . Use fixed-position , ultrasonic couple gel-coated Introducer eliminate possibility urethral abrasion trauma might otherwise occur without Introducer move transducer within prostatic imaging region . 3 . Insertion Introducer wire-rotationally-driven ultrasonic transducer coat sterile water ultrasonic couple transducer introducer 4 . The examiner would initiate automated scan procedure analog/digital video data 256 transverse axial image slice prostate gland . The scan gland stop start election examiner 5 . A video-media record image derive procedure available experienced reader interpretation . The initial UreScan hydrophone verify specification include : 1 . 256 transverse , automatically axially advanced , image slice . 2 . Approximately 267 megabit video data . 3 . Diagnostic ultrasound scan 100 revolution per minute 9.0 M Megahertz . 4 . Radial penetration 6 cm . The scanner feature : 1 . The amplitude reflect ultrasonic echo biological tissue , display density-based oscillogram directly proportional density tissue insonated adjusted flat far-gain ultrasonic system . 2 . Longitudinal time-related , ultrasonic densitometry image-registered comparison sonogram demonstrate progression and/or regression disease consistent efficacy treatment procedure . This facilitate future `` wait watch surveillance '' know suspect lesion potentially minimize and/or eliminate unnecessary surgical biopsy tissue procedures 3 . The reflected echo waveform sonogram show unique type disease entity . In prostate disease , unique difference image-markers prostate cancer normal tissue . The present study protocol determine image-markers cancer unique prostate pathology specifically identify . Further clinical study require determine sensitivity , specificity , accuracy ( +/- ) predictor value procedure . Additional study require determine amplitude image-markers could use determine approximate stage image detect disease process .</detailed_description>
