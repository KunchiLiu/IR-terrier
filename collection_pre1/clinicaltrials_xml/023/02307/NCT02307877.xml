	<brief_summary>Rates brain atrophy long term user fingolimod compare glatiramer acetate examine patient relapse form multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . As patient long term therapy typically little overt sign white matter inflammatory activity ( T2 , gad lesion ) , brain atrophy measure provide insight whether continued progression MS patient . What remain unknown whether patient particular therapy slower rate brain atrophy . This would provide convince evidence central nervous system tissue injury suppress . Such information would substantial clinical benefit decide various therapy . The investigator estimate impact long term use fingolimod therapy ( define minimum two year therapy ) whole brain atrophy treat patient relapse form MS compare age gender match patient Glatiramer Acetate . The investigator secondary goal determine correlation brain atrophy cognitive performance treat patient relapse form MS . The investigator also examine correlation NeuroQualityofLife ( NeuroQOL ) PROs , patient self-reports disability , clinical assessment physical disability , work productivity , clinical assessment cognitive functioning whole brain volume loss patient long term fingolimod vs. long term glatiramer acetate therapy match age gender . The investigator anticipate finding study generate relevant hypotheses relationship .</brief_summary>
