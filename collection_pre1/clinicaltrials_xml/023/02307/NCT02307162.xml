	<brief_title>SAD/MAD Study New Formulation Nebulised RPL554 Healthy Subjects COPD Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomise , double blind , placebo control study new suspension formulation RPL554 comprise Single Ascending Dose ( SAD ) phase ( Part A ) healthy subject , Multiple Ascending Dose ( MAD ) phase ( Part B ) healthy subject MAD phase ( Part C ) stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) subject . Each cohort comprise 10 subject 7 active : 3 placebo ratio Subjects screen 14 day first dose study drug end study visit 4 10 day last dose study drug . Part A . Single Ascending Dose Study Healthy Male Subjects age 18-50 . Each subject receive single dose study drug . The start dose 1.5 mg plan escalation 2 fold multiple unless safety data indicate escalation small interval . If RPL554 well tolerate particular dose level , dose may reduce next cohort.The decision whether escalate new dose level , dose , base formal review Dose Review Group ( DRG ) . Part B . Multiple Ascending Dose Study Healthy Male Subjects age 18-50 . The start dose Part B determine data Part A study . Each subject receive follow dos study drug confine study centre dosing : three dos intervals 8 hour Days 1 5 , follow single morning dose Day 6 . The DRG may determine basis safety PK data dose interval subsequent cohort every 12 hour , rather every 8 hour . Part C. Multiple Ascending Dose moderate , stable COPD Subjects age 40-75 Subjects know significant concurrent disease , recent exacerbation , expect able withhold regular bronchodilator therapy duration treatment phase study . Rescue medication ipratropium allow ( use record ) subject may continue inhaled corticosteroid stable dose . The dosing schedule Part B Dose Escalation Procedures The decision whether escalate new dose level one part study next select dose base formal review DRG safety data . The DRG include Principal Investigator Sponsor 's Medical Expert ( and/or delegate ) meet teleconference review safety data cohort . The DRG review available safety data ( include adverse event [ AEs ] , safety laboratory test , spirometry ECG data ) collect 24 hour post dose Part A , 24 hour post final dose Parts B C. Data collect study enter case report form transfer database use double entry . Blinding maintain query resolve database lock . AEs summarise study treatment intensity relationship study treatment . The study primarily evaluate use descriptive statistic . The sample size select base formal power calculation .</detailed_description>
