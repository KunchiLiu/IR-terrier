	<brief_summary>The main objective study compare efficacy two weight lose strategy ( obesity surgery gastric banding , standard care ) physical performance elderly obese person submit physical training . Our hypothesis surgery-induced weight loss context physical training ( recommended people 60-75 yr lose weight ) improve physical performance compare standard care ( 3-5 % weight loss ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomized clinical trial ; Single Blind A physical training recommend people 60 yr . engage weight-losing program , order prevent impairment physical performance . Therefore physical training program ( endurance strength training ) implement subject participate study , start 1 month randomization . It last 13 month . Patients randomize either surgical group ( gastric band general anesthesia ) reference group ( mild calorie restriction coaching ) . Physical performance patient evaluate screening , inclusion , randomization , 6 12 month randomization .</detailed_description>

This level physical impairment consider comorbidity elderly . The French Ministry health ( HAS ) recommend obesity surgery consider ( gastric banding ) patient fulfil follow criterion : Subjects BMI 40kg/m² , 35kg/m² least one comorbidity improve weight loss present among hypertension , obstructive sleep apnea , severe metabolic disorder ( type 2 diabetes , NASH ) , rheumatologic condition associate disability .
