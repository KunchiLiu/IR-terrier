	<brief_summary>Following spinal cord injury autonomic regulation cardiovascular system impair , result variety measurable abnormality blood pressure . Evidence causality document general medical literature finding improve cognitive function follow acute increase blood pressure use anti-hypotensive agent Midodrine Hydrochloride ( midodrine ) . Additionally , recent report document inverse association blood pressure depression suggest low blood pressure may confer great risk high blood pressure . Midodrine drug approve Food Drug Administration treat low blood pressure general population . Midodrine approve United States treat low blood pressure person spinal cord injury . Therefore , use study investigational . The first objective characterize relationship blood pressure , cerebral blood flow velocity cognitive function single dose midodrine compare placebo . Second objective determine long-term safety efficacy midodrine administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute Study : The purpose research study measure spinal cord injure individual 's blood pressure blood flow brain rest thinking task single dose midodrine , drug use treat low blood pressure ( 10 mg ) . Eligible participant complete 2 visit laboratory . Visit 1 , subject give midodrine Visit 2 , subject give placebo . The order drug random . Observational Study : The purpose research study determine blood pressure change throughout day spinal cord injure individual . There drug study . This study last 1 month subject visit laboratory 2 time , begin end month . The subject give blood pressure monitor ask record his/her blood pressure least 3 time day . The laboratory visit involve participant discuss his/her monthly blood pressure recording experience blood pressure monitor . 30-Day Crossover Study : The purpose research study determine safety efficacy midodrine administration 30-day period time . Midodrine drug approve Food Drug Administration treat low blood pressure general population . Midodrine approve United States treat low blood pressure person spinal cord injury . Therefore , use study investigational . The subject 's participation involve 10 week subject ask visit laboratory 8 time . The subject ask take midodrine first 30 day 14 day washout period , subject ask take placebo 30 day . The order drug random . The subject study investigator know drug subject receive first second 30 day-treatment phase . For visit 1,4 , 5 8 ( Initial visits-start new drug administration Post Visits- end new drug administration ) , subject complete many different think task his/her blood pressure , heart rate cerebral blood flow take . The subject also complete quality life survey , autonomic dysreflexia survey , take home blood pressure monitor continue monitor blood pressure . For visit 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 , subject 's blood pressure , cerebral blood flow heart rate measure . Subject also complete autonomic dysreflexia survey . 30-Day Crossover &amp; MRI/Functional MRI ( fMRI ) Study : Eligible participant addition complete 30-Day Crossover study ( procedure explain ) , also complete MRI/fMRI Visit 1 , 4 , 8 .</detailed_description>
