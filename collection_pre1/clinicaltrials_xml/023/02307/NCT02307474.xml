	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study side effect stereotactic body radiation therapy pazopanib hydrochloride treat patient kidney cancer able undergo surgery . Stereotactic body radiation therapy specialize radiation therapy delivers high dos radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzyme need cell growth . Giving pazopanib hydrochloride stereotactic body radiation therapy may help make tumor small alternative treatment patient undergo surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study SBRT With Adjuvant Pazopanib Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate treatment relate toxicity report follow stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) determination tolerability combine therapy patient clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tumor diameter/volume change prior follow pazopanib treatment prior SBRT . II . To determine impact pre SBRT pazopanib therapy radiation therapy target volume evidence tumor shrinkage . III . To evaluate tumor change radiation therapy target volume incidence treatment related toxicity report spar non-involved nephron . IV . Report change tumor control follow pazopanib SBRT evaluate post treatment repeat biopsy and/or Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . OUTLINE : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily 60 day . Patients continue receive pazopanib hydrochloride PO daily undergo SBRT every day day 60-65 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month .</detailed_description>
