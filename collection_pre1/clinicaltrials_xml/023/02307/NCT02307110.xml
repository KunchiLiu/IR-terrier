	<detailed_description>Purpose : This study design evaluate prevalence different stage diabetic retinopathy diabetic macular edema among patient suffer type 1 diabetes 5 25 year treat intensified insulin therapy aim near-normal blood glucose level whole duration disease . Objectives : The primary objective examine prevalence ( percentage ) stag diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) diabetic macular edema ( DME ) within one cross-sectional examination . Key secondary/exploratory objective prevalence ( percentage ) stag diabetic macular edema ( DME ) , mean individual average 5year-/10year-/15year-/20year-/25year-HbA1c value ( % ) measure long-term glycemic control , mean individual average 5year-/10year-/15year-/20year-/25year-blood pressure ( mmHg ) measure long-term blood pressure control , mean BCVA score , mean contrast sensitivity score , mean NEI-VFQ 25 score ( detail see section Objectives ) . Study design : Non-interventional cross-sectional investigator initiate study . The study conduct Vista Klinik Binningen/Switzerland ( ophthalmological evaluation ) Department Endocrinology University Hospital Basel/Switzerland ( patient recruitment ) . Study population : All patient DM Type 1 least 5 year maximum 25 year disease duration intensify insulin therapy whole duration disease , currently follow-up DM1 Department Endocrinology University Hospital Basel/Switzerland . In order prevent selection bias , patient screen enrollment consecutively . For In-/exclusion criterion see section Eligibility . Investigational reference therapy : None . Assessments : - Visual acuity measurement use ETDRS-like testing chart test distance 4 meter - Contrast sensitivity - Ophthalmic examination ( slit lamp exam fundus biomicroscopy , intraocular pressure ) - High resolution optical coherence tomography ( Spectralis-OCT ) - Stereoscopic fundus photography - Fluorescein angiography - NEI-VFQ 25 ( 25-item National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionnaire )</detailed_description>
