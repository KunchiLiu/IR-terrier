	<brief_summary>Beta thalassemia ( β-thalassemia ) common genetic disease worldwide . Individuals thalassemia bear defect hemoglobin . Hemoglobin protein red blood cell carry oxygen vital organ brain , heart , lung kidney . Thalassemia major hereditary anemia characterize little ß-globin production , result hemolysis ( breakdown destruction red blood cell ) due formation unstable alpha-globin tetramers ineffective erythropoiesis uniformly fatal absence regular transfusion . Although improvement conservative treatment improve prognosis thalassemia considerably disease transfusion relate complication affect patient progress time , cause severe morbidity shorten life expectancy . Substantial lifelong health care expense also involve , often financial burden family unsustainable develop country . The hypothesis patient beta thalassemia undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) &gt; 1 year post-HSCT less long term comorbidities higher quality life ( QOL ) compare beta thalassemia maintain supportive care . In order ass quality life , quality life questionnaire ask . Extraction data patient 's medical record also use determine comorbidities occur either HSCT supportive care therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) consider suitable alternative conservative management include chronic transfusion therapy , iron chelation ( iron overload ) management complication transfusion therapy iron overload . Barriers HSCT consideration include risk inherent transplant- early mortality , graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , graft rejection , infection prior immune reconstitution , transplant relate organ toxicity . As supportive care , significant progress make HSCT thalassemia make last 3 decade . This result disease-free survival ( DFS ) rate exceed 80 % especially young , low-risk patient histocompatible ( gene ) family donor recently even unrelated donor transplant follow streamline preparative regimen improvement post-HSCT supportive care . Lucarelli colleague Pesaro initially pioneer HSCT thalassemia describe standard `` Pesaro '' risk stratification scheme base liver size physical examination , fibrosis detect liver biopsy , chelation history . This used year risk stratify patient HSCT show correlate well immediate transplantation outcome . More recently report Center International Blood Marrow Transplant Research ( CIBMTR ) Asian sub-continent result Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) -matched sibling HSCT thalassemia major confirm age transplantation liver size independent predictor mortality transplantation . In patient age &lt; 7 year without hepatomegaly ( liver palpate &lt; 2 cm costal margin ) , 5-year probability Overall Survival ( OS ) DFS 98 % 94 % , respectively ( ref ) . Morbidity thalassemia patient ( transplant relate non-transplanted ) attribute iron overload associate end organ damage . Although data long term outcome chronically transfuse thalassemia patient , data long-term outcome HSCT thalassemia remain limited . Some patient undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) hop cure Beta-Thalassemia . Other patient manage Beta-Thalassemia supportive care include chronic blood transfusion , iron chelation medication . The purpose study compare patient Beta-Thalassemia HSCT versus patient manage Beta-Thalassemia supportive care . This proposal aim compare long term outcome thalassemia patient survive HSCT thalassemia compare age sex match patient remained transfusion therapy regular chelation . In order compare two subset patient , data obtain Thalassemia Longitudinal Cohort ( TLC ) study .</detailed_description>
