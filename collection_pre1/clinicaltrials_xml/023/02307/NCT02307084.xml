	<brief_title>Ultrasound Prevent Leg Wound Complications Heart Bypass .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A vein leg widely widely harvest coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) surgery bypass diseased coronary artery . This vein call long saphenous vein . Currently , long saphenous vein ( LSV ) harvest blind surgical practitioner image prior surgery decide whether vein suitable use heart bypass surgery . This result fruitless incision result additional unnecessary surgical wound leg ( ) identify suitable section vein use bypass operation . In case , excessive surgical trauma leg increase risk wound infection . There evidence ultrasound image LSV improve leg wound outcomes patient CABG surgery . Some study report reduction vein wound infection rate , vein harvest time , length hospitalisation length wound . The purpose study investigate potential benefit ultrasound image randomise control trial . One group ultrasound image long saphenous vein prior heart bypass surgery . A second group undergo ultrasound image current practice Bristol Heart Institute . Ultrasound image long saphenous vein allow plan selection optimal segment vein . This targeted approach allow guidance surgical incision away unsuitable segment thus potentially improve leg wound outcomes . The primary endpoint study ass leg wound infection two randomise group . Other endpoint assess patient satisfaction , wound length , time take remove vein , blood loss leg wound surgery number wound leg .</detailed_description>
