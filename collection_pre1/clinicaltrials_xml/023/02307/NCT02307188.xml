	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) atrial flutter ( AFL ) common cardiac arrhythmia adult , account substantial portion patient morbidity healthcare expenditures . Great effort put forth discover effective treatment AF/FL . Promising result catheter ablation suggest AF/FL may eliminate majority patient . For example , data numerous laboratory show 85 percent patient paroxysmal form AF may free recurrence anti-arrhythmic drug one year follow-up .</detailed_description>
