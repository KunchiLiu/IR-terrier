	<brief_summary>Overdose potential deadly outcome serious problem among opioid abuser , least Norway . The annual death toll overdose 250 , high road traffic accident . Those inject heroin opioids consider high risk death overdose . To save life , immediate treatment Î¼-opioid antidote naloxone require . Usually naloxone injected muscle blood vessel . Administration naloxone via nose ( intranasal ) suggest alternative use emergency team possibly also bystander . This easy way give naloxone , would also eliminate risk needle stick injury blood contamination . In series study intranasal naloxone The Norwegian University Science Technology , study explores pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics intranasal intramuscular naloxone healthy volunteer influence remifentanil .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Pharmacodynamics New Formulation Nasal Naloxone Prehospital Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy volunteer bring state opioid influence well-known , short acting , control safe manner use remifentanil . Naloxone well-known , well-tolerated drug excellent safety profile many decade use . The current formulation proven safe without local systemic side effect study conduct far . The excipients present nasal formulation well know . This study two aim . Firstly investigate naloxone body opioid influence , apply well-tested model infusion potent opioid remifentanil ( Target Control Infusion ) . This create state strong opioid effect short time highly controlled fashion , induce state miosis , reduce respiratory rate reduce sensation pain , three strong indicator opiate . Naloxone antagonise effect , change measure . Choosing intramuscular 0.8 mg naloxone comparison mean novel intranasal naloxone formulation compare well-established described treatment protocol opioid overdose Norway use today . Secondly pharmacokinetic profile intranasal intramuscular naloxone study . The measurement preparative study ( OPI 12-001 OPI 13-001 ) take : Serum naloxone concentration time calculate maximum concentration , Time maximum concentration , Area Under Curve Relative bioavailability . There two main reason repeat measurement . In contrast previous study current protocol participant influence strong opioids . This may significant physiologic effect , explore whether pharmacokinetics intranasal formulation change . The reason study pharmacokinetics naloxone compare actual dosage administration rout naloxone used doctor paramedic pre-hospital setting . This do , spite widespread use treatment , The measurement remifentanil serum open possibility relate pharmacodynamic data directly actual serum concentration opioid time . Care take include opioid user study naloxone would precipitate acute withdrawal . Also possible drug misusers exclude well people access remifentanil infusion equipment daily work , although abuse potential highly specialise drug minimal . Safety formulation also study measure vital sign patient report nasal discomfort potential adverse reaction study . By weigh spray device , intramuscular syrinx discharge reliability dose deliver confirm .</detailed_description>
