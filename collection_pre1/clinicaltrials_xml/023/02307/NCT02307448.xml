	<brief_summary>This investigation plan initiate heal chronic wound provide concentrated platelet growth factor therapy directly wound site topical delivery . This therapy derive autologous platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) , emerge surgical wound care treatment . This investigation aim demonstrate patient chronic , non-healing wound treat autologous PRP standard medical care reduction wound volume improve healing rate result patient-centered clinically significant health outcome compare patient treated standard medical care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Autologous Platelet Rich Plasma Treatment Chronic Non-Healing Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter randomize controlled trial , single-blind parallel design . 1,500 subject plan enroll study . Each subject assign treatment random order . The stratified permuted block randomization method apply patient assignment . In addition three study population , i.e. , DFU , VU PU , study center , stratification base one overall variable , ( 1 ) nutritional status ( Low : Prealbumin &lt; 12mg/d vs. moderate : Prealbumin &gt; = 12 mg/d ) one variable wound type . Diabetic food ulcer base offloading ( 2a ) ( Specialty shoe vs. Total contact cast ) , pressure ulcer base offloading ( 2b ) ( mattress vs. cushion ) , venous leg ulcer base compression ( 2c ) ( Low : &lt; 10 mmHG vs. High : &gt; =30mmHG ) . Randomization proceed within stratum accord permuted block scheme block size , balance interval , vary randomly 2 , 4 6 . The primary endpoint evaluate blind physician avoid bias . Total duration patient study expect 20 week .</detailed_description>
