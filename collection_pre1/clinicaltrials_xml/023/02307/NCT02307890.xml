	<brief_summary>Donation cardiac death ( DCD ) livers increasingly utilised liver transplantation concern exist regard negative result . Ischemic cholangiopathy ( IC ) damage one bile ducts probably cause inadequate blood flow failure biliary epithelium regenerate . It typically present week month liver transplantation , often refractory treatment result requirement re-transplantation . Although IC common follow DCD liver transplantation , otherwise difficult predict underlie pathogenesis poorly understood . The aim study correlate microRNA ( miRNA ) level marker senescence liver bile duct biopsy take liver transplantation incidence IC follow liver transplantation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study population Tissue decease adult liver transplant graft collect . The test sample select procedure liver transplant recipient develop IC . The control sample include tissue procedure transplant recipient uncomplicated outcome . There match test sample control sample base range clinical factor . Consent Standard consent organ donation documentation general consent research section . Due small risk damage blood vessel take sample liver transplant recipient also consent procedure take place . Tissue sample Liver bile duct sample graft obtain various different time point liver transplant procedure . Processing specimen Following removal specimen , sample divide added RNAlater ( Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ) , 10 % formaldehyde snap frozen . At late time point sample analyse . Definition ischemic cholangiopathy IC define stricture , dilatation , irregularity intra- extrahepatic bile duct liver graft . Isolated stricture bile duct anastomosis exclude . The diagnosis base least one adequate imaging study biliary tree , exclusion hepatic artery thrombosis Doppler ultrasound , compute tomography conventional angiography .</detailed_description>
