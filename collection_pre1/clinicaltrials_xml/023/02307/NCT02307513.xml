	<brief_summary>Behcet 's disease , rare disorder cause inflammation blood vessel throughout body . The sign symptoms Behcet 's disease may include mouth sore , eye inflammation , skin rash lesion , genital sore vary person person may come go . The exact cause Behcet 's unknown , may autoimmune disorder , mean body 's immune system mistakenly attack healthy cell . This study test whether apremilast well placebo ( inactive substance form drug ) treatment oral ulcer subject active Behçet 's disease . Other manifestation disease also assess , , pain tenderness joint , eye inflammation , genital ulcer , skin disease . This study also test well body tolerates apremilast . This study randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel design . About 204 subject participate . The placebo-controlled period 12 week long patient receive apremilast placebo . After 12-week placebo-controlled period , subject receive apremilast 1 year . All subject final study visit 4 week stop apremilast treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Understand voluntarily sign informed consent document prior study related assessments/procedures conduct . 2 . Male female subject ≥18 year age time sign informed consent document . 3 . Able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . 4 . Diagnosed Behçet 's disease meeting International Study Group ( ISG ) criteria 5 . Oral ulcer occur least 3 time previous 12month period , include oral ulcer Screening Visit . 6 . Subjects must least 2 oral ulcer Visit 1 ( Screening Visit ) , : a. least 2 oral ulcer Visit 2 ( day randomization ) , Visit 2 occurs least 14 day Visit 1 . OR b. least 3 oral ulcer Visit 2 ( day randomization ) , Visit 2 occurs time 1 day 42 day Visit 1 . 7 . Have prior treatment least 1 nonbiologic Behçet 's Disease therapy , , limit , topical corticosteroid , systemic treatment . 8 . Candidate systemic therapy , treatment oral ulcer . . A candidate systemic therapy subject judge study Investigator someone whose mucocutaneous ulcer consider inappropriate topical therapy base severity disease extent affect area , whose oral ulcer adequately control topical therapy . 9 . Laboratory Measures : Must meet following laboratory measure : Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL White blood cell ( WBC ) count ≥ 3000 /L ( ≥ 3.0 X 10^9/L ) ≤ 14,000/L ( ≤ 14 X 10^9/L ) Platelet count ≥ 100,000 /L ( ≥ 100 X 109/L ) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL ( ≤ 132.6 μmol/L ) Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Aspartate transaminase ( AST [ serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase , SGOT ] ) alanine transaminase ( ALT [ serum glutamate pyruvic transaminase , SGPT ] ) ≥1.5 X ULN . Subjects fail screening due ≥ 1.5 X ULN AST/SGOT and/or ALT/SGPT allow repeat AST/SGOT and/or ALT/SGPT test within Screening Phase . Repeat test result ≤ ULN ( within reference range ) eligible . Laboratory test allow repeat 1 time , Investigator 's clinical judgment , reasonable possibility repeat test meet exclusion value , concurrence Medical Monitor . Contraception Requirements : All Females Child Bearing Potential ( FCBP ) must use one approve contraceptive option describe take apremilast least 28 day administration last dose apremilast . At time study entry , time study FCBP 's contraceptive measure ability become pregnant change , Investigator educate subject regard contraception option correct consistent use effective contraceptive method order successfully prevent pregnancy . All FCBP must negative pregnancy test Visits 1 2 .
