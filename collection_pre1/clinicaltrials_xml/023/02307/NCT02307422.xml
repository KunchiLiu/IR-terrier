	<brief_summary>The design purpose current study expand validate previous finding IL-1 gene cluster composite genotype pattern potentiate risk coronary artery disease ( CAD ) cardiovascular event mediate OxPL Lp ( ) . A secondary objective validate , non IL-1 genetic variant associate CAD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The conclusion earlier study indicate contribution OxPL/apoB Lp ( ) angiographically document CAD CAD event conditional proinflammatory IL-1 genotype . This novel paradigm link etiology atherogenesis attribute OxPL Lp ( ) genetics clinical expression CAD . ILI also identify functional IL-1 gene variation regulate IL1B gene haplotype context appear explain over-expression IL-1β , well expression inflammatory biomolecules downstream IL-1β . The functional IL-1 variant combine pattern associate risk severe periodontal disease across multiple ethnic/racial population . It also important test functional genetic pattern similar interaction OxPL Lp ( ) biomarker level association angiographically document CAD CAD event . DNA extract previously obtain subject blood sample ( 1173 subject ; 18 year 90 year entry ( coronary angiography ) ) University General Hospital Ioannina , Greece study site . DNAs label anonymized subject ID # ( de-identified ) , ship ILI genotyping genetic analysis . Phase II determine whether gene variation ( SNPs ) previously show literature associate CAD and/or CAD-related secondary event validate study population .</detailed_description>
