	<brief_summary>A Phase II randomize trial initiated evaluate closure perforate tympanic membrane primary measureable outcome . The goal determine safety efficacy Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 ( FGF-2 ) closure chronic tympanic membrane perforation ( TMP ) . If FGF-2 topically apply treatment chronic TMP human , hypothesize safe , tolerable effective use treatment tympanic membrane perforation . A total 60 subject recruit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A Phase II randomize trial initiated evaluate efficacy primary measureable outcome . Eligible consented patient randomize 3:1 ratio optimal biologic dose ( OBD ) FGF-2 placebo ( sterile water ) . Application study treatment may occur initial Screening Visit ( pending eligibility requirement confirm ) Visit 1 may repeat follow visit need maximum three treatment per treatment arm . These follow visit occur three week ( +/- 7 day ) last treatment application . During visit , subject 's tympanic membrane examine , photograph , additional otologic test perform . If perforation find close visit , subject report 2 month ( +/-7 day ) final study visit . If subject 's TMP close third final application assign treatment group , subject cross treatment group . Again , subject may give three additional treatment new group . The follow visit follow schedule , occur three week ( +/- 7 day ) last treatment . The otologic procedure perform previous visit . All subject report final study visit 2 month ( +/- 7 day ) last follow visit perforation determine closed subject complete maximum number study visit without perforation closure . The study complete reporting purpose subject complete 2 month ( +/- 7 day ) follow final visit .</detailed_description>
