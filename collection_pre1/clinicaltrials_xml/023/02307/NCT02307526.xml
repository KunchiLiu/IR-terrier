Researchers currently investigate orthostatic BP effect acetylcholinesterase inhibition pyridostigmine bromide ( 60 mg ) 10 individual complete ( AIS A ) 10 individual incomplete ( AIS B , C , &amp; D ) SCI . The primary objective study compare BP response head-up tile ( HUT : 45° ) no-drug pyridostigmine ( 60 mg ) individual SCI document OH ; compare orthostatic BP response follow pyridostigmine ( 60 mg ) 10 individual complete ( AIS A ) 10 individual incomplete ( AIS B &amp; C ) SCI Subjects test two separate day . On day 1 testing , subject transfer onto tilt table remain supine position entirety test . During first 60 minute subject remain rest supine position . Following 60 minute rest position , progressive head-up tilt utilized table adjust 15° , 25° , 35° 5 minute angle maintain 45° 45 minute subject experience symptom compromise cerebral blood flow , include , limited , light headedness , blurry vision , dizziness nausea . On day 2 testing , protocol duplicate exception drug administration . 60 mg study drug , pyridostigmine administer 30 minute mark rest supine position . Data heart rate , blood pressure , cerebral blood flow monitor continuously progressive HUT maneuver record 10 minute interval 45° HUT .</detailed_description>
