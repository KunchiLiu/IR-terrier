	<brief_summary>A recent pilot study conduct HealthEast find use manual pressure SoftSeal hemostatic pad 15 minute successful 9 10 people fully anticoagluated use 4 French radial sheath . There evidence radial artery occlusion small sample bleeding limit grade 1 . This evidence support large retrospective study confirm result define alternative TR band use post radial artery access cardiac catheterization . Primary Objective Determine incidence arterial bleed real-world use SoftSeal hemostatic device transradial access site 4 French system manual pressure compression ulnar artery . Secondary Objective Determine incidence thrombosis access site subject presence thrombus radial artery reverse barbeau test ; incidence change circulation , movement sensation ( CMS ) hand wrist impacted hand ; incidence hematoma ecchymosis , assess prior discharge .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This non-randomized , retrospective study observe usefulness SoftSeal . Only patient radial procedure use study . Study Procedure For patient 4 French catheter , SoftSeal apply per physician instruction . Current protocol use include compression ulnar artery visit . Any bleed observed site manual pressure hold SoftSeal constitute failure achieve hemostasis patient manage per standard care ( SOC ) . Data Plan Following completion clinical care extract data related primary secondary objective . Data extraction include documentation CMS , reverse Barbeau incidence hematoma ecchymosis . Any additional statistical analysis manuscript write do part separate agreement meet approval HaelaTheast Medical Research Institute Chitogen . Sample Size Calculation Since real-world data analysis project control group , sample size calculation . We believe approximately 50 patient enough provide understand use instruction SoftSeal product .</detailed_description>
