The `` Acquiring New Skills While Enhancing Remaining Strengths Veterans ( ANSWERS-VA ) '' intervention aim provide Veteran caregiver dyad set practical skill use cop managing symptom brain injury , apply strength-based approach . Objectives : The objective study conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) evaluate ( ) efficacy ANSWERS-VA dyadic intervention Veterans sustain stroke and/or TBI informal caregiver , ( b ) estimate effect size ANSWERS-VA intervention . The ANSWERS-VA intervention compare educational intervention serve attention control group . Specific Aim 1 : To tailor implementation ANSWERS-VA intervention dyad Veterans post stroke and/or TBI informal caregiver ( n=10 ) modify implementation process RCT . Specific Aim 2 : To test short-term ( immediately post-intervention ) long-term , sustain ( 12 24 week , 1 year ) efficacy ANSWERS-VA intervention improving : ( ) primary outcomes caregiver ' quality life unhealthy day , ( b ) caregiver mediator task difficulty , threat appraisal , self-efficacy caregiving , optimism .
