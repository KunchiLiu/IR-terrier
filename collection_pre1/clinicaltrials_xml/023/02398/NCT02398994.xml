	<brief_summary>This multi-center randomized control trial evaluates addition intravenous immunoglobulin standard treatment corticosteroid improve outcome child adult first episode Transverse Myelitis Neuro-myelitis optica . Half participant receive corticosteroid alone , whilst half receive corticosteroid plus intravenous immunoglobulin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicentre randomiSed Controlled TRial IntraVEnous Immunoglobulin Versus Standard Therapy Transverse Myelitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transverse myelitis ( TM ) severe demyelinate condition predominantly affect young people , cause significant long-term disability approximately one third . Current initial treatment corticosteroid , although evidence use base extrapolation trial adult multiple sclerosis relapse . In view severity condition , additional treatment trialed . Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) often use second-line treatment steroid-unresponsive central nervous system demyelination , although evidence efficacy limit small case series case report . Randomized controlled trial demonstrate IVIG reduces inflammation enhance remyelination number neurological condition , although randomize controlled trial test use adult child TM . This study evaluate additional early treatment IVIG extra benefit TM compare current standard therapy intravenous steroid alone .</detailed_description>
