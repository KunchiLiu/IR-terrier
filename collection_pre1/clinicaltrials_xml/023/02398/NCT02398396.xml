	<detailed_description>Neisseria meningitidis ( N. meningitidis , meningococcus ) lead cause bacterial meningitis septicaemia worldwide . The introduction serotype specific glycoconjugate vaccine routine infant immunization schedule , country United Kingdom , lead dramatic reduction burden disease . The development effective vaccine capsular group B N. meningitidis long unmet need necessitate development novel approach vaccine design . In 2013 , first capsular group B meningococcal vaccine license UK . The new vaccine ( 4CMenB , trade name Bexsero ® ) , manufacture Novartis Vaccines contain four component - recombinant Factor H bind protein ( FHbp ) , Neisseria meningitidis capsular group B Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen ( NHBA ) fusion protein , recombinant Neisseria meningitidis group B Neisserial adhesin A ( NadA ) protein Outer membrane vesicle ( OMV ) Neisseria meningitidis group B strain NZ98/254 contain PorA P1.4 . This multicomponent vaccine also refer `` four component meningococcal B '' `` 4CMenB '' vaccine . Factor H bind protein important virulence factor express surface N. meningitidis key component 4CMenB vaccine . It establish function FHbp bind human complement factor H , whose physiological function turn act important down-regulator host alternative complement pathway . Binding human factor H bacterial surface via FHbp think interfere complement mediate lysis important immune evasion strategy N. meningitidis . Consequently , FHbp logical target protective vaccine capsular group B N. meningitidis . There remain several gap knowledge underlie mechanisms human antibody FHbp elicit complement mediate bactericidal activity . In human immunised vaccine contain FHbp , antigen ( FHbp ) expect form complex human factor H. The precise epitope target anti-FHbp antibody vaccinee fully elucidate . Conceivably , formation FHbp-factor H complex follow vaccination may prevent exposure key FHbp epitope . Therefore , know whether interaction FHbp human Factor H affect bactericidal activity antibody produce follow vaccination 4CMenB . This study investigate breadth protective activity serum anti-FHbp antibody response adult immunize 4CMenB ( Bexsero® ) vaccine well investigating nature B-cell T-cell response induced vaccination . We aim enroll 15 20 healthy adult age 18 60 , immunize two dos 4CMenB ( Bexsero® ) two month apart accord license schedule . Sera obtain baseline dose vaccine , assay IgG antibody responses FHbp ELISA , well bactericidal activity panel genetically diverse meningococcal strain ability inhibit bind FH FHbp . Other assays meningococcal immunity may also perform antibody bind live bacteria measure flow cytometry , ability serum antibody confer passive protection infant rat bacteraemia model . Laboratory analysis quantify B- T-cell response specific 4CMenB vaccine perform use peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) derive study participant sample , dose . We also explore whether formation FH-FHbp complex result generation cross-reactive antibody direct Factor H. This first study human explore detail anti-FHbp characteristic generate follow immunization 4CMenB ( Bexsero® ) offer unique opportunity use license vaccine improve understand induce efficient protective response . It hop result obtain study contribute understand host response vaccination capsular group B N. meningitidis .</detailed_description>
