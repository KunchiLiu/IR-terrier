	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics JNJ 53718678 Healthy Japanese Adult Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , single center , double-blind ( study neither researcher participant know treatment participant receive ) , placebo-controlled ( study experimental treatment procedure compare placebo treatment ) , randomize ( study medication assign participant chance ) study healthy Japanese adult participant reside outside Japan . The study consist Screening phase , In-clinic treatment phase , follow-up phase . The study duration participant approximately 6 week Screening ( Day -28 Day -2 ) follow visit ( Day 10 14 ) . Participants randomly assign receive JNJ 53718678 placebo , plan dose 250 , 500 1000 milligram ( mg ) . Planned dos stepwise escalate , safety tolerability precede dose ( ) find acceptable , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) reach . De-escalation may perform order study intermediate dose . The safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile JNJ-53718678 primarily evaluate . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
