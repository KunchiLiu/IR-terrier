	<brief_summary>Nowadays , research priority low back pain area find subgroup patient characteristic might achieve good outcome specific intervention . However , even though study area increase , question nature remain without adequate answer , limited evidence . Therefore , investigator propose examine ability clinical test , develop assess alteration related clinical lumbar instability , identify subgroup patient non specific chronic low back pain may better outcome motor control exercise intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relationship Between Clinical Tests Clinical Outcomes After Motor Control Exercises Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Changes relative clinical instability well establish individual non specific chronic low back pain . However , population , change vary widely , characterize heterogenous group . Motor Control Exercises ( MCE ) aim improve impaired coordination deep superficial muscle trunk , reestablish stability lumbar spine reduce common alteration population , associate reduction pain disability patient non specific chronic low back pain . To specific assessment change find population , clinical test often use : assessment identify motor control alteration ; intervention parameter treatment progress ( e.g . increase exercise difficulty ) ; intervention , ensure normalization motor control . There several clinical test assess change relative clinical instability , : Clinical Classification Scale ( CCS ) assess abdominal muscle coordination superficial deep trunk muscle ; Clinical Test Thoracolumbar Dissociation ( CTTD ) ass anterior/posterior tilt maintain constant position thoracolumbar junction ; Prone Instability Test ( PIT ) Passive Lumbar Extension Test ( PLET ) use detect structural lumbar instability . Therefore , primary objective study : investigate ability clinical test predict clinical outcome , pain disability , motor control exercise program , investigate association two test predict clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
