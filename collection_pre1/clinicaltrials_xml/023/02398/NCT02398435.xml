	<brief_summary>The objective study ass safety , tolerability early sign efficacy investigational drug Tadekinig alfa Adult-onset Still 's disease , rare polygenic auto-inflammatory disorder treatment remain empirical . This disease characterize daily spike fever , arthralgia / arthritis , skin rash frequent component sore throat , lymphadenopathies neutrophilic leukocytosis . The etiology unknown . In addition above-mentioned clinical feature , diagnosis include laboratory component reflect systemic inflammation : high erythro-sedimentation rate , C-reactive protein , high serum ferritin high level interleukin 18 ( IL-18 ) . Tadekinig alfa drug name recombinant human interleukin-18 binding protein ( IL-18BP ) . This investigational drug test healthy volunteer , psoriasis rheumatoid arthritis patient phase I study . It demonstrate good safety tolerability profile mild adverse event injection site .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The hypothesis study considers high level IL-18 active Adult-onset still 's disease therapeutic target . Treatment IL-18BP permit inhibit pro-inflammatory cascade trigger IL-18 may help manage different component disease . This study open label , dose-finding study involve multiple center Europe . Two dose cohort ( 80mg 160mg ) treat twelve week followed-up four week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients age 18 year old , diagnose AoSD base presence Yamaguchi criterion active disease ( see appendix 2 ) , irrespective continuation permit treatment mention Patients active disease consider exhibit least two Yamaguchi 's major criterion ( see appendix 2 ) screen visit plus least either fever elevation marker inflammation ( CRP ≥ 10 mg/L ) . Patients exposed NSAIDS , Prednisone ( least 5mg/day ≥1 month ) and/or synthetic sDMARDs ( methotrexate dose least 10mg/day ≥ 3 month ) without response treatment incomplete response treatment Women childbearing potential negative pregnancy test screening , V3 , V4 , V5 V6 agree follow highly effective birth control recommendation study 1 month end treatment . Birth control method consider highly effective either : combine ( estrogen progestogen contain ) hormonal contraception associate inhibition ovulation , progestogenonly hormonal contraception associate inhibition ovulation , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , intrauterine hormonereleasing system ( IUS ) , bilateral tubal occlusion , vasectomized partner sexual abstinence . In case delay menstrual period ( one month menstruation , confirmation absence pregnancy strongly recommend . This recommendation also apply woman child bear potential infrequent irregular menstrual cycle . As regard duration contraception study , take account median halflife Tadekinig alfa almost 40h , 5 halflives represent duration 200 hour . In order safe side , poststudy contraception duration Patients maintain treatment stable dos NonSteroidal antiinflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) , Prednisone ( stable dose Prednisone least 5mg/day ) , sDMARDs Tadekinig alfa treatment ( methotrexate dose least 10mg/week ) . Specifically baseline level prednisone treatment maintain taper ( due patient improvement ) , requirement prednisone increase treatment consider treatment failure . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent Previous treatment biologicals allow follow washout period respect : one week anakinra , two week etanercept , 6 week , adalimumab , certolizumab , golimumab , tocilizumab , abatacept 8 week infliximab . Previous rituximab administration require 6 month washout normal Bcell count previous treatment canakinumab require 6 month washout . Patients first episode AoSD le one month therapy Prednisone sDMARDs Patients active chronic infection ( i.e . Tuberculosis ( TB ) , HIV , HBV &amp; HCV ) Patients suffer inherited immunodefinciency diseases Patients suffer immunemediated inflammatory disease , include RA , SLE , etc . spondylarthropathies , inflammatory bowel disease . Patients white blood cell count 2'500 cells/mm3 Concomitantly treat biologicals Women childbearing potential unwilling use highly effective birth control method ( see definition Inclusion criterion ) 1 month end participation study . Inability understand unwilling sign write informed consent Any acute chronic lifethreatening disease : Such cancer , irreversible organ failure heart , liver , lung kidney ( creatinine high 1.5 X upper limit normal ) . Patients receive adalimumab , certolizumab , golimumab , tocilizumab , abatacept within 6 week , infliximab within 8 week , canakinumab within 6 month , etanercept within 2 week , anakinra 1 week prior start Tadekinig alfa enrol study . Patients receive rituximab within 6 month and/or persistent low Bcell count eligible enrolment . Subject expect comply study procedure Currently participate participate another clinical trial last 4 week prior begin study .
