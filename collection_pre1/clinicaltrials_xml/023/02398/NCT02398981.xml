	<brief_summary>In developed world critical illness routinely treat intensive care unit ( ICU ) highly specialized physician , nurse support staff . This model intensive care spread rapidly low middle income country spread , challenge limitation model arise . In resource-poor setting , inadequate human resource , training , equipment present barrier safe effective use life-saving procedure . The advance medical informatics human factor engineering provide tremendous opportunity novel user-friendly clinical decision support ( CDS ) tool applied complex busy hospital setting . Real-time data feed standardize patient care task simulate acute care environment proven significant advantage novel interface ( compare conventional ) reduce provider cognitive load error . Currently researcher within investigator 's research group develop pilot test simple electronic decision support tool : CERTAIN ( Checklist Early Recognition Treatment Acute Illness ) . This tool successfully test validate simulated setting implement pilot study 18 country . Worldwide infant early childhood mortality continue high partly due inability recognize respond aggressively critical illness . Investigators expect adaptation algorithm CERTAIN potential powerful tool improve medical care child develop country . Investigators aim project 1 ) develop pediatric adaptation CERTAIN ( CERTAINp ) 2 ) implement clinical practice resource-poor setting evaluate impact tool process patient outcome .</brief_summary>
