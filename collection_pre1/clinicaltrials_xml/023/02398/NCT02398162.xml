	<brief_summary>This observational study natural immune response scrub typhus patient recruit Chiangrai Prachanukroh Hospital , N-Thailand . Febrile patient positive IgM rapid diagnostic test ask wish take part study improve understand body respond scrub typhus . Blood sample collect participant ( `` STP '' , n=60 ) baseline ( day presentation hospital ) , 2 week later hospital , 12 week baseline clinic visit 1 year later . Data clinical presentation relapse record . Control subject scrub typhus expose patient rural village caption area Prachanukroh Hospital ( `` STE '' , n=80 ; approx . 40 child 40 adult ) , healthy adult blood donor Bangkok ( `` STH '' n=30 ) - subject enrol one single blood sample . The study team also collect eschar swab specimen STP group non-invasive specimen dark crust day enrollment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To measure characterize memory effector T-cell response , well humoral response young patient acute scrub typhus compare theseThese acute response compare response convalescent phase individual 2 , 12 52 week later , well scrub typhus-exposed control healthy control . Secondary Objectives : - To establish ELISpot flow cytometer base immunology assay use human sample collect rural area high scrub typhus endemicity . - To set prospective cohort study paediatric scrub typhus region high endemicity Description Study Sites Population Chiangrai Prachanukroh Hospital Chiangrai province , N-Thailand ideally suit study . We well-established collaboration , due previously complete multi-year fever study excellent relationship local senior doctor , staff hospital-based laboratory . There high rate scrub typhus case admit infectious disease ward recent establishment MORU ( Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit ) satellite laboratory within hospital facility , make study site unique highly suit perform research project . This study contribute significantly towards long-term aim develop Chiangrai study site towards immunogenicity monitoring field site vaccine trial . The 'scrub typhus ' patient ( STP ) febrile child recruit ID and/or pediatric ward Prachanukroh hospital acute hospitalization due scrub typhus , follow describe . The scrub typhus 'exposed ' cohort ( STE ) consist child adult recruit two village area scrub typhus report common disease . This cohort high risk previous contact scrub typhus , unknown asymptomatic sub-clinical infection past , expect presence form immune memory regard cellular and/or humoral immunity large proportion subject . The healthy scrub typhus naïve control group ( STH ) necessarily need include child , principle compare non-exposed immune response previously expose and/or acute cellular response . Thus , 'Healthy Cohort ' recruited staff MORU and/or Faculty Tropical Medicine Bangkok .</detailed_description>
