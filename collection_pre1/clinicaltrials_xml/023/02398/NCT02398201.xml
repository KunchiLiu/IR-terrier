	<brief_summary>The purpose study gather preliminary data whether bezafibrate improve cellular energy production mitochondrial disease . Mitochondrial disease rare inherit disorder arise due deficient energy production within cell body . Consequently , typical clinical feature arise organ high energy requirement . Mitochondrial disorder exhibit highly variable clinical effect , individual within family . Characteristic symptom include muscle weakness ( myopathy ) , hear loss , migraine , epilepsy stroke like episode addition diabetes heart problem . Mitochondrial disorder therefore impact considerably quality life life expectancy . Despite , proven disease modify treatment available . Pre-clinical study identify several exist medication improve mitochondrial function . Of , bezafibrate best supportive data , already license treatment high blood fat , well characterised side effect profile . The investigator therefore conduct feasibility study bezafibrate people mitochondrial myopathy . Ten affected participant recruit receive titrating course bezafibrate three time daily 12 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mitochondrial disorder genetically determine metabolic disease affect approximately 1 5000 people . Current strategy treat mitochondrial disorder limit , restrict alleviate symptom . A recently publish Cochrane review identify disease modify treatment proven benefit . There therefore urgent currently unmet need treatment modify underlie biochemical deficit disease trajectory . Improving deficient oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) pathways induction mitochondrial biogenesis potential approach treatment mitochondrial disorder . This involve stimulating transcription factor nuclear mitochondrial genome simultaneously order up-regulate respiratory chain ( RC ) gene expression . This role fulfil peroxisome proliferator activate receptor ( PPAR ) -γ coactivator-1α ( PGC-1α ) ; pivotal transcriptional co-factor widely consider master regulator mitochondrial biogenesis . PGC-1α interacts number transcription factor . These include α , β/δ γ isoforms peroxisomal proliferator activate receptor ( PPARs ) . This group ubiquitously express nuclear receptor activate bind fatty acid . Subsequently , transcription gene involve mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation induce , thereby enable cellular metabolic shift glycolysis . Additionally , PGC-1α co-activates estrogen relate receptor alpha ( ERRα ) ; nuclear respiratory factor ( NRF ) 1 2 ( transcription factor bind promoter region target nuclear gene involve respiratory chain ) ; TFAM ( transcription factor A mitochondrial ) , modulate mitochondrial DNA transcription replication . PGC-1α expression induce cold exposure , starvation exercise . The PPARs , AMP-protein activate kinase ( AMPK ) sirtuin 1 ( Sirt1 ) also increase PGC-1α activity provide mean pathway pharmacologically manipulate . Indeed , several compound identify exert effect way include : bezafibrate glitazones ( PPAR agonists ) ; metformin AICAR ( AMPK ) ; resveratrol ( Sirt1 ) . Of , bezafibrate , glitazones metformin establish relevance diabetes hyperlipidaemia . Their mechanism action also provide rationale use metabolic disorder obesity mitochondrial disease . Indeed , bezafibrate show promise disease modify pharmaceutical agent pre-clinical study use cellular animal model mitochondrial myopathy . Cellular model mitochondrial disease demonstrate improvement variety measure mitochondrial function grow bezafibrate enrich medium . This include cell line comparable specific patient group propose review feasibility study . Furthermore , mouse model mitochondrial myopathy demonstrate improvement clinically relevant outcome include time disease manifestation life span . This phase II , open label , non-randomised feasibility study aim build work obtain pre-clinical study provide proof principle data human affected common form mitochondrial muscle disease . This study design provide proof efficacy . However , bezafibrate exert demonstrable molecular effect , investigator anticipate need large , randomised trial bezafibrate future . An additional aim feasibility study , therefore obtain relevant data determine many patient investigator would need large trial ; biochemical clinical measurement investigator would use determine drug effect trial .</detailed_description>
