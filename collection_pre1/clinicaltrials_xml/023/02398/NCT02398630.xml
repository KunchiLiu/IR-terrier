	<brief_summary>Abstract : Recent advance reproductive medicine generate demand accurate image method identify specific cause female infertility gynecologic disorder . Virtual hysterosalpingography emerge modality aspect establish technique hysterosalpingography combine cutting-edge technology multidetector compute tomography ( CT ) allow comprehensive highly accurate evaluation female reproductive system pelvic anatomy generally . Unlike ultrasonography ( US ) magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging , multidetector CT capable depict external internal surface uterus , fallopian tube , pelvic organ , provide high-resolution data suitable two- three-dimensional reconstruction virtual endoscopic view . Thus , virtual hysterosalpingography may prove superior noninvasive modality evaluate tubal patency . Moreover , comparison conventional hysterosalpingography , may involve cervical clamping , virtual hysterosalpingography painless . Because health risk associate ionize radiation , use another modality ( eg , MR imaging , US ) may prefer presence focal uterine lesion strongly suspect . However , virtual hysterosalpingography multidetector CT may provide diagnostic advantage complex case .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Infertility common problem affect one six couple . It define inability get pregnant reasonable time ( 12 month ) sex without use birth control measure . The cause increase prevalence infertility difficult establish . This increase could due several factor postponement time decide child , alteration semen quality , change sexual behavior , etc . The study infertile couple always focus different factor : ovulatory ( 20 % ) , utero-tubal ( 30 % ) , migration sperm ( 10 % ) male ( 30 % ) . About 40 % infertile couple exhibit combination factor 15 % display objective alteration lead definite diagnosis . During last two decade major change occur approach infertility . With introduction new assist reproductive technology , development molecular biology novel diagnostic imaging method , major advance evaluation treatment couple consider infertile . Hysterosalpingography ( HSG ) useful image method evaluate fallopian tube uterine cavity . Scanning perform follicular phase cycle carry X-ray fluoroscopy . Indications HSG reduce introduction new diagnostic method , actually basically essencial technique use study factor responsible infertility well recurrent abortion . On downside , exposure radiation use impingement cervix procedure , possible complication mention . Due technological advance , new technique base CT study develop , call virtual Hysterosalpingography ( HSG-V ) . It perform multislice CT scanner high resolution quality image . It noninvasive study need none pinch cervix . It ability ass blockage defect uterine tubal problem , besides appreciate abnormality may cause inability couple achieve pregnancy . Also reveal organ pelvis entirety fallopian tube , inside wall . This help detect presence polyp , adhesion , fibroid , narrow tube , occupy lesion light . Compared conventional HSG , advantage non-invasive , painless take second , condition provide woman great comfort . Moreover , provide doctor complete information conventional method , provide two-dimensional three-dimensional endoscopic image . Additionally , radiation receive patient le require conventional study . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) female pelvis large study performance evaluation pelvic pathology ( endometriosis , fibroid , adenomyosis , etc. ) . Contributing characteristic non-invasive use ionizing radiation . It high resolve power assessment ovarian uterine pathology , especially useful case ultrasound inconclusive . It also play dual role case uterine malformation : It allow extension and/or confirmation ultrasound diagnosis evaluates associated malformation , mainly urinary system . Major limitation MRI low availability , presence pacemaker metallic foreign body . A relative advantage lower cost compare HSG-V , low cost making multiple conventional study . Current assessment patient infertility involve several study determine causative factor . The virtue MRI position integrative alternative conventional multi-modal method study female pelvis .</detailed_description>
