	<brief_summary>The purpose first-in-human study evaluate safety tolerability single ascending dos LMG324 determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( nvAMD ) subject . Enrollment expand safe tolerate dose treatment naïve nvAMD subject compare single intravitreal ( IVT ) dose LMG324 ranibizumab 0.5 mg administer every 4 week change baseline best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) Week 12 ( Day 85 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study start single dose ascend ( SAD ) phase . LMG324 administer Day 1 treatment implementation standard care ( SoC ) therapy . SoC therapy ranibizumab 0.5 mg administer per label . Dose group implement sequentially allow safety review current subsequent dose group . All treatment open-label , include ranibizumab use SoC therapy . In enrollment expansion phase , subject randomize LMG324 arm receive single LMG324 IVT injection Day 1 follow sham ( fake ) IVT injection implementation SoC therapy . After implementation , SoC therapy apply monthly sham injection apply interim planned visit . The enrollment expansion phase may start select dose level whilst dose escalation phase still ongoing .</detailed_description>
