	<detailed_description>Sunitinib give 50 mg/day schedule 4/2 ( 4 week treatment , 2 week ) standard care first-line treatment metastatic renal cell carcinoma , schedule report high rate dose reduction dose discontinuation safety profile . Sunitinib 50mg/day schedule 2/1 ( 2 week treatment , 1 week ) report associate significantly decrease toxicity patient initially experience grade 3 great toxicity schedule 4/2 could extend treatment duration considerably . Through research , would like explore whether schedule 2/1 sunitinib 50 mg/day first line therapy could provide efficacy standard schedule 4/2 term progression-free survival , objective response , overall survival , reduce drug-related toxicity metastatic renal cell carcinoma patient .</detailed_description>
