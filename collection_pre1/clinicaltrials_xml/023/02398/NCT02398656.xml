	<brief_summary>This trial enroll patient diagnose transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) minor stroke occur within past 12 hour . Anyone diagnose minor stroke face possibility long-term disability even death , regardless treatment . Stroke symptom weakness , difficulty speak paralysis may improve worsen hour day immediately follow stroke . TEMPO-2 minor stroke trial patient present within 12 hour symptom onset . Patients randomize TNK-tPA standard care . In intervention group TNK-tPA give single , intravenous bolus ( 0.25mg/Kg ) immediately upon randomization . Maximum dose 50mg . The control group receive antiplatelet agent ( ) decide treat physician . Antiplatelet agent ( ) choice treat physician 's discretion . TEMPO-2 Coordinating Centre locate Calgary , AB , Canada . There approximately 50 site participate worldwide . Dr. Shelagh Coutts Principal Investigator .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial TNK-tPA Versus Standard Care Minor Ischemic Stroke With Proven Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TEMPO2 multicentre , prospective randomize open label , blinded-endpoint ( PROBE ) control trial thrombolysis low dose Tenecteplase ( TNK-tPA ) versus standard care . A total 1274 patient enrol , approximately 50 site worldwide . TEMPO-2 enroll patient within 12 hour time window NIHSS score &lt; 6 ASPECTS &gt; 5 . All patient evaluate clinically undergo brain image use CT follow immediately CT angiogram . Patients must intracranial occlusion CTA CTP . Randomization 1:1 TNK-tPA ( experimental ) standard care antiplatelet agent ( control ) . Experimental : TNK-tPA ( 0.25mg/kg ) give single , intravenous bolus immediately upon randomization . Experimental treatment administer single intravenous bolus 1-2 minute . Control : Patients treat standard care base antiplatelet treatment - choice discretion investigator . Low dose aspirin ( single agent ) choice physician , choose use combination aspirin clopidogrel . The local investigator choose antithrombotic regime use All patient treat within 90 minute first slice baseline CT . Patients undergo study CT angiogram intracranial circulation 4-8 hour treatment determine whether occluded artery recanalized . In site MRI/MRA routinely use substitute CT/CTA . Any patient neurological worsen standard care brain imaging complete rule intracranial hemorrhage . All patient standard care medical management acute stroke unit undergo follow-up image 24 hour CT MR. Use MR encourage . Patients assess 24 hour Days 5 90 . The Day 90 Outcomes perform blind assessor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Acute ischemic stroke adult patient ( 18 year age old ) 2 . Onset ( lastseenwell ) time treatment time ≤ 12 hour . 3 . TIA minor stroke define baseline NIHSS ≤ 5 time randomization . Patients persistent demonstrable neurological deficit physical neurological examination . 4 . Any acute intracranial occlusion near occlusion ( TICI 0 1 ) ( MCA , ACA , PCA , VB territory ) define noninvasive acute imaging ( CT angiography MR angiography ) neurologically relevant presenting symptom sign . Multiphase CTA CT perfusion require study . An acute occlusion define TICI 0 TICI 1 flow.1 Practically include small amount forward flow presence near occlusion AND , Delayed washout contrast pial vessel multiphase CTA region brain concordant clinical symptom sign OR , Any area focal perfusion abnormality identify use CT MR perfusion e.g . transit delay ( TTP , MTT T Max ) , region brain concordant clinical symptom sign . 5 . Prestroke independent functional status structure mRS ≤2 . 6 . Informed consent patient surrogate . 7 . Patients treat within 90 minute first slice CT MRI . Scans repeat meet requirement ; change neurologically CT head need repeat assessment extent depth ischemia . 1 . Hyperdensity NCCT consistent intracranial hemorrhage . 2 . Large acute stroke ASPECTS &lt; 7 visible baseline CT scan . 3 . Core establish infarction . No large area ( estimate &gt; 10 cc ) grey matter hypodensity similar density white matter judgment enrol neurologist consistent subacute ischemic stroke &gt; 12 hour age . 4 . Clinical history , past image clinical judgment suggest intracranial occlusion chronic . 5 . Patient severe fatal disabling illness prevent improvement followup treatment would likely benefit patient . 6 . Pregnancy 7 . Planned thrombolysis IV tPA endovascular thrombolysis/thrombectomy treatment . 8 . Inhospital stroke unless patient baseline prior stroke . E.g . patient stroke diagnostic coronary angiogram . 9 . Commonly accept exclusion medical thrombolytic treatment . These commonly relative contraindication ( i.e . final decision discretion treat physician ) purpose TEMPO2 include follow : International normalize ratio &gt; 1.7 know full anticoagulation use standard novel anticoagulant therapy full anticoagulant dosing . [ DVT prophylaxis dose shall prohibit enrolment ] . For LMWH novel anticoagulant , 48 hour drug consider sufficient allow trial enrollment . Dual antiplatelet therapy prohibit enrolment . [ For patient know take anticoagulant therapy necessary wait coagulation lab result ( e.g . PT , PTT ) prior treatment ] Patients acutely treat GP2b3a inhibitor . Arterial puncture noncompressible site previous seven day Clinical stroke serious head spinal trauma precede three month would normally preclude use thrombolytic agent . History intracranial hemorrhage , subarachnoid hemorrhage brain hemorrhage would normally preclude use thrombolytic agent . Major surgery within last 3 month bodily site bleeding could result serious harm death . Known platelet count 100,000 per cubic millimeter . Treatment delay wait platelet count unless thrombocytopenia know suspect . Gastrointestinal genitourinary bleeding within past 3 month unresolved associated persist anemia thrombolytic treatment kind would result serious bleed death .</criteria>
