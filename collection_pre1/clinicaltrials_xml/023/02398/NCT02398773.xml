	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study F-18 16 alpha-fluoroestradiol ( FES ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) predict response endocrine therapy patient newly diagnose breast cancer spread part body . FES radioactive form hormone estrogen may `` light '' cancer body . Diagnostic procedure use FES , FES PET/CT , may help measure FES help doctor predict well cancer respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FES PET/CT Predicting Response Patients With Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Breast Cancer Receiving Endocrine Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine negative predictive value ( NPV ) [ 18F ] fluoroestradiol ( FES ) uptake response ( clinical benefit ) 6 month patient estrogen-receptor positive ( ER+ ) metastatic breast cancer treat first-line endocrine therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine test-retest reproducibility quantitative assessment tumor FES uptake standardized uptake value ( SUVs ) . II . To evaluate accuracy FES-PET/CT predicting response patient treat first line endocrine therapy metastatic breast cancer . III . To evaluate accuracy FES-PET/CT predict progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient treat first line endocrine therapy metastatic breast cancer . IV . To examine role FES-PET/CT predict progressive disease ( PD ) clinical benefit ( CB ) , concert semi-quantitative interpretation ER , progesterone receptor ( PgR ) , marker proliferation Ki-67 ( Ki-67 ) . V. To evaluate relationship among FES uptake , measure maximum SUV ( SUVmax ) semi-quantitative ER immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . VI . To evaluate FES SUVmax &lt; 1.5 optimal cutpoint predict progression-free survival ( PFS ) first line endocrine therapy metastatic breast cancer . VII . To determine percent eligible patient biopsy feasible , i.e. , determine clinical utility indirect assay ER expression FES-PET/CT . VIII . To evaluate heterogeneity tumor FES uptake individual patient define variability lesion 's FES uptake . OUTLINE : Between 0 30 day start endocrine therapy , patient receive F-18 16 alpha-fluoroestradiol intravenously ( IV ) 2 minute undergo PET/CT . Patients may undergo second FES-PET/CT study least 24 hour first study later 10 day initial study . After completion study , patient follow 6 month periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
