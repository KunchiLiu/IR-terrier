	<detailed_description>This project design begin characterize abnormality glucagon secretion subject cystic fibrosis relate diabetes along spectrum glucose tolerance . This descriptive , cross-sectional longitudinal cohort study sample child young adult CF continuum glucose tolerance compare healthy age-matched control . Cystic fibrosis patient normal glucose tolerance well cystic fibrosis relate diabetes well control subject admit research unit three separate occasion undergo oral glucose tolerance test , mixed meal tolerance test , one step hypoglycemic clamp . Cystic fibrosis patient return 12 month later undergo repeat mixed meal tolerance test hypoglycemic clamp test .</detailed_description>
