	<detailed_description>RATIONALE The result ECLAT - first randomize control trial address impact electronic cigarette use relation smoking reduction , smoke abstinence safety long-term - reveal important persistent modification smoke habit 300 smoker ( intend quit ) significant reduction tobacco cigarette ' consumption ( 1 ) . Surprisingly , reduction cig/day use ECLAT much different among study group , non-nicotine study group perform much like high low nicotine study group . This , product use ECLAT , saliva cotinine level well concentration threshold consider representative regular smoker ( 2 ) experience electronic cigarette user ( 3 ) high low nicotine study group . Specifically , model investigation ECLAT efficient deliver nicotine ( 4 ) . With mind , design pilot study compare efficiency tolerability personal vaporizer ( PV ) new generation electronic cigarette load nicotine e-liquid cigalike new generation electronic cigarette load nicotine usual smoking habit , group well characterize regular smoker unwilling quit . STUDY OBJECTIVES Aims pilot study : - ass Personal Vaporizers ( PV ) effectively reduce tobacco smoke - compare efficacy data PV E-cigs well `` cigalike '' efficacy - evaluate PV E-cigs safe use METHODS Study Population 200 regular smoker ( smoke ≥ 10 cigarette per day least past 5 year ; eCO ≥ 10 ppm ) , age 18-70 year , good general health ; commit follow trial procedure recruit follow placement advertisement local newspaper radio/TV network . Exclusion criterion include : recent vaping history ( stop vaping less 3 month ago ) ; use form non combustible nicotine containing product ( chewable tobacco nicotine replacement therapy ) symptomatic cardiovascular disease ; clinical history asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) ; regular psychotropic medication use ; current past history alcohol abuse ; use smokeless tobacco nicotine replacement therapy , pregnancy breastfeeding . Study Products Personal Vaporizer electronic cigarette This new generation device consist large lithium battery part ( capacity 2600 mAh ) internal electronic circuit include current stabilizer allow user manually adjust energy apply atomizer . A new-generation atomizer use fill approximately 2 ml liquid . The Energy delivery atomizer set 9 watt . These electronic cigarette provide free charge manufacturer . The liquid provide free charge manufacturer Alterna Farmaceutici , Francia Farmaceutici group . `` Cigarette-like Electronic Cigarette '' The Cigalike e-Cigarette disposable battery-powered electronic nicotine delivery device ( ENDD ) - closely resemble shape tobacco cigarette - design purpose nicotine ( and/or aroma ) delivery , tobacco combustion necessary operation . This e-Cigarette contains propylene glycol-free liquid consist distilled water , FCC grade vegetable glycerin , natural flavor , artificial flavor , citric acid may also contain pharmaceutical grade nicotine . The lithium battery capacity 250 mAh fully charge use . Cartomizers fill approximately 1 ml nicotine contain liquid.These electronic cigarette provide free charge manufacturer . Study Design Procedures Two hundred regular smoker , ( willing quit ) recruit center follow placement advertisement local newspaper radio/TV network . At baseline , participant randomize three separate study group . Fifty participant randomize study group A receive `` Personal Vaporizer electronic cigarette '' 24-weeks supply e-liquid ( active group ) ; fifty subject study group B , 24-week supply `` Cigarette-like Electronic Cigarette '' ( active group ) ; one hundred participant study group C continue usual smoking ( control group ) . Study Schedule Participants attend study visit smoke cessation clinic approximately time day . With exception baseline study day , visit take approximately 10-15 minute . At baseline ( study visit 1 ) , socio-demographic factor , detailed smoking history craving annotate individual pack-years ( pack/yrs ) calculate . Eligible participant invite sign inform consent form . Cigarette dependence measure Fagerstrom Test Cigarette Dependence ( FTCD ) . Additionally , level carbon monoxide exhale breath ( eCO ) measure use portable device ( Micro CO , Micro Medical Ltd , UK ) . Vital sign ( HR BP ) , body weight , adverse event also record baseline . Participants group A B give free supply electronic smoking ( average 2-week supply ecigs ) instruct correctly use . Key troubleshoot support provide phone number supply medical assistance . They also request fill 2-weeks ' study diary record adverse event . No emphasis encouragement , motivation reward smoke cessation effort provide since study intend monitor smoker ( unwilling quit ) use three different situation . Baseline visit ( Visit 1 ) brief - Informed consent - Inclusion/exclusion criterion - CRF ( smoke Hx , FTND , eCO , HR , BP , weight , AEs ) - Craving/VAS - Randomization either study group A ( Nic ) B ( Nic ) - Provide PV Ecig Cigalike dispense 2-weeks supply electronic smoking ( depend study arm allocation ) - Dispense 2-weeks ' study diary AEs By large , week-2 ( study visit 2 ) , week-4 ( study visit 3 ) , week-8 , week-12 , week-24 , participant ) receive study diary residual study period , b ) eCO level vital sign record , c ) return complete study diary use study product . Additionally , saliva sample collect week-12 week-24 cotinine measurement state smoke ( even puff ) eCO ≤ 7ppm . Cotton roll place polypropylene tube store -20°C use . Saliva sample analyse duplicate cotinine analysis gas chromatography . At end week-24 study visit , product provide investigator . Week-2 visit ( Visit 2 ) brief - Collect 2-weeks ' study diary AEs - CRF ( . cig/day , eCO , HR , BP ) - Craving/VAS - Smokers ' product preference survey - Dispense next 2-weeks supply electronic smoking ( depend study arm allocation ) - Dispense next 2-weeks ' study diary AEs Week-4/8 visit ( Visits 3 4 ) brief - Collect study diary AEs - CRF ( . cig/day , eCO , HR , BP ) - Craving/VAS - Dispense next 4-weeks supply electronic smoking ( depend study arm allocation ) - Dispense next 4-weeks ' study diary AEs Week-12 visit ( Visit 5 ) brief - Collect study diary AEs - CRF ( . cig/day , eCO , HR , BP weight ) - Craving/VAS - Collect saliva sample* ( zero cig/day eCO ≤ 7ppm , * Times saliva sampling require standardization , e.g . time day , within 2 hr last vape ) - Dispense next 12-weeks supply electronic smoking ( depend study arm allocation ) - Dispense next 12-weeks ' study diary AEs Week-24 visit ( Visit 6 ) - Collect study diary AEs - CRF ( physical examination , . cig/day , eCO , HR , BP weight ) - Craving/VAS - Collect saliva sample* ( zero cig/day eCO ≤ 7ppm , * Times saliva sampling require standardization , e.g . time day , within 2 hr last vape ) - Smokers ' product preference survey Study Outcome Measures A ≥50 % reduction number cig/day baseline , define self-reported reduction number cig/day ( ≥50 % ) compare baseline ( together eCO level reduction , objectively document reduction baseline ) , calculate study visit ( `` reducer '' ) . Abstinence smoking , define complete self-reported abstinence tobacco smoke - even puff ( together eCO concentration ≤7 ppm ) , calculate study visit ( `` quitter '' ) . Failing meet criterion defines smoke reduction/cessation failure . Adverse event , symptom think related tobacco smoke e-Cigarette use withdrawal nicotine annotate baseline subsequent study visit adverse event page study diary . Vital sign also record . Participants ' perception like product assess ask rate level satisfaction product compare cigarette use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 0 10 point ( 0 = 'completely unsatisfied ' , 10 = 'fully satisfy ' ) ; use scale , also rate much miss brand ( 0 = 'did miss ' , 10 = 'missed much ' ) whether would recommend friend/relative ( 0 = 'not recommend ' , 10 = 'absolutely recommend ' ) .</detailed_description>
