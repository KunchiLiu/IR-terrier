	<brief_title>Evaluate Safety Feasibility Injecting PMD-MSC Into Penis Treat Symptoms Mild Moderate ED</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimate 18 million men United States diagnose Erectile Dysfunction ( ED ) . ED physical condition trigger man 's mental , emotional , medical state . Defined repeat consistent problem sustain erection suitable sexual intercourse ; ED lead performance anxiety depression result partner men ED also suffer emotional psychological effect . Lifestyle , smoking , medical condition diabetes , hypertension vascular problem , prostate cancer medication side effect contribute cause ED . Conservative treatment begin lifestyle change ; natural remedy include use herbs L-Arginine , Ginko , Zinc , Yohimbe . Prescription medication know phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor often use costly . therapy involve penis pump/penis vacuum , penile implant offer permanent solution surgery improve blood flow penis improve erection . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) use variety medical treatment repair regenerate acute chronically damage tissue . These cell potential repair human tissue form cell mesenchymal origin , cartilage , bone , fat , muscle , blood vessel . Most research focus bone marrow derive stem cell ( BMC ) however process harvest cell invasive , painful , yield low cell count . The human placenta offer alternative source form MSCs . Placental Matrix-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( PMD-MSCs ) compromise novel cellular repair matrix derive placental mesenchyme . Mesenchyme meshwork embryonic connective tissue mesoderm , form muscular connective tissue body also blood vessel . PMD-MSCs provide extracellular matrix viable mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) coordinate tissue repair process , regenerative growth factor , anti-inflammatory cytokine require regenerate damage vasculature penile corpus . Injecting PMD-MSCs penile corpus replace dysfunctional dead cell intrigue option cell-based treatment ED . The research propose establish safety feasibility utilize intracavernosal injection PMD-MSCs treat Erectile Dysfunction .</detailed_description>
