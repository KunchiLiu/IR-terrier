	<brief_summary>Most daily activity involve alternate period exercise rest . If recovery slow follow exercise mean next period activity may difficult COPD patient becomes restrict daily life . Therefore , investigator interest study effectiveness physiological effect breathe PEP device post-exercise period hypothesize 1 . Post-exercise breathe PEP device increase rate recovery breathe without PEP device . 2 . Post-exercise breathe PEP device create harmful effect cardiopulmonary function COPD patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Positive Expiratory Pressure Breathing The Rate Post-exercise Recovery Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) 4th lead cause morbidity mortality worldwide 2012 represent important public health challenge preventable treatable . COPD characterize persistent airflow limitation usually progressive associate enhance chronic inflammatory response airways lung noxious particle gas . The pathophysiological hallmark COPD expiratory air flow limitation . During exercise , increase ventilatory demand induce premature airway closure force expiration lead air trap lead lung hyperinflation . Dynamic hyperinflation ( DH ) exercise contributes increase end expiratory lung volume ( EELV ) , reduce inspiratory capacity ( IC ) , increase mechanical load inspiratory muscle lead dyspnea , exercise intolerance , limited physical activity , thus poor quality life COPD patient . In addition , abnormal lung mechanical function dynamic hyperinflation lead increase sensation dyspnea , disparity respiratory drive respiratory mechanical response . Abnormal control blood chemical vasculature factor also aggravate sensation dyspnea . The autonomic dysfunction ( AD ) occur patient COPD evident inability heart rate reach appropriate level exercise ( chronotropic incompetence ; CI ) . There also prolong heart rate recovery ( HRR ) end exercise may contribute increase dyspnea sensation increase mortality rate COPD . Expiratory flow retardation breathe positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ) device one various technique manage dyspnea COPD . Most study use PEP device focus investigating effect PEP reduce lung hyperinflation , reduce dyspnea , increase exercise capacity . Only one study Martin Devenport , examine effect PEP breathe recovery period exercise find follow 6 minute sub-maximal treadmill walking , 6 breath exhalation 10 cmH2O threshold PEP reduce dyspnea increase HRR . Oxygen pulse saturation ( SpO2 ) also increase within 2 minute although statistical significant group .</detailed_description>
