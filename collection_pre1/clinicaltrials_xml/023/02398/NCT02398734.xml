	<detailed_description>Stroke third common cause death majority develop country many year . Internal carotid ( ICA ) stenosis one common etiological factor ischemic stroke ( IS ) , cause 10 - 35 % stroke . Stroke risk increase increase severity ICA stenosis risk higher symptomatic stenosis asymptomatic one . Results NASCET , ECST ACAS study show carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) beneficial therapy patient symptomatic ICA stenosis &gt; 50 % &gt; 70 % , resp. , patient asymptomatic ICA stenosis &gt; 60 % &gt; 85 % , resp . Surgical risk CEA vary 2 15 % . However , even clinically silent microembolism cause microinfarctions present postoperative cognitive deficit . Since 1970s , vitro animal model study demonstrate acceleration thrombus dissolution use ultrasound beam . Alexandrov et al . refer high number early recanalizations acute stroke patient middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) occlusion treat use systemic thrombolysis combination transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) monitoring . Between 2002 2005 , three study demonstrate potential effect diagnostic ultrasound acceleration spontaneous induced recanalization intracranial artery . There 2 possible effect ultrasound thrombus - [ 1 ] mechanical destruction due vibration thrombus acceleration penetration fibrinolytics thrombus [ 2 ] elevation temperature stimulation endothelium local activation fibrinolytic system . The result grant project NR/9487-3/2007 show TCD monitoring significant effect activation fibrinolytic system healthy volunteer . Transcranial Doppler monitoring CEA common diagnostic method use detection microemboli change blood flow intracranial stenosis . Reduction periprocedural complication CEA TCD monitoring refer study . This reduction stroke risk due sophisticated indication shunt implementation , optimization surgery anesthesia accord blood flow change detection microemboli MCA use TCD monitoring . Another course reduction microinfarctions local activation endogenous fibrinolytic system due TCD monitoring ( equal sonothrombolysis acute stroke study ) . Recently publish SONOBUSTER Trial show intraoperative sonolysis reduce incidence volume new brain infarction follow CEA . These benefit evident large infarction ( volume ≥ 0.5 mL ) extend beyond region directly expose ultrasonic wave ( i.e. , contralateral hemisphere ) . Effect cognitive function decline significant study due low number patient . STUDY OBJECTIVES The objective randomized , double-blind , sham-controlled study demonstrate safety effectiveness sonolysis ( continual TCD monitoring ) use 2-MHz diagnostic probe maximal diagnostic energy reduction stroke , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) brain infarction activation endogenous fibrinolytic system CEA patient ≥ 70 % symptomatic asymptomatic stenosis ICA . The substudy aim compare risk brain infarction detect use magnetic resonance sonolysis control group . STUDY DESIGN Overview SONOBIRDIE Trial randomize , single-blind , sham-controlled study design demonstration safety effectiveness sonolysis ( continual TCD monitoring ) reduction risk stroke TIA , brain infarction cognitive decline sonolysis CEA patient ≥ 70 % ICA stenosis . Expected sample size The sample size base expect 2.5 % absolute risk reduction stroke TIA 30-day postoperative period sonolysis group ( estimate prevalence , 1.5 % ) compare control group ( estimate prevalence , 4 % ) . Pre-study calculation show minimum 704 patient group need reach significant difference alpha value 0.05 ( two-tailed ) beta value 0.8 assume 10 % would lose follow-up refuse participate study ( estimate 39 end-points ) . The sample size substudy base expect 15 % reduction new ischemic lesion diffusion weight imaging-MRI ( DWI-MRI ) sonolysis group ( estimate prevalence , 10 % ) compare control group ( estimate prevalence , 25 % ) . Pre-study calculation show minimum 124 patient group need reach significant difference alpha value 0.05 ( two-tailed ) beta value 0.8 assume 10 % would lose follow-up refuse participate study . Test device The transcranial Doppler system ( e.g . DWL Multi-Dop T1 , DWL , Sipplingen , Germany ) diagnostic 2-MHz probe use sonolysis ( non-diagnostic TCD Doppler monitoring ) . Sonolysis In patient randomized sonolysis group , MCA segment depth 55 mm continuously monitor intervention use diagnostic 2-MHz transcranial Doppler probe maximal diagnostic energy ( TIC~1.3 ) , sample volume 10 mm . Sham procedure In patient randomize control group , TCD probe fix require position use special helmet sonolysis group patient , MCA segment depth 55 mm localize use diagnostic 2-MHz transcranial Doppler probe maximal diagnostic energy TCD monitoring stop afterwards . Carotid endarterectomy Surgery perform general local anesthesia ( decision leave discretion operate team ) use cut front angle sternomastoid muscle . Common carotid artery ( CCA ) later ICA external carotid artery ( ECA ) cut free . Common carotid artery , ICA ECA temporarily close . Using longitudinal cut CCA ICA , atherosclerotic plaque visualize . Plaque withdraw microscopic control later suture arteriotomy perform use monophil non-absorbent fibre 6/0 . Just end surgery , haemostatic process control drainage do . Surgery complete suture subcutis cutis . Unfractioned heparin ( 100 IU/kg bodyweight ) administer patient arteriotomy . In case insufficient collateral flow MCA clip CCA ICA , temporal shunt use . Antiplatelet therapy ( Aggrenox , clopidogrel 75 mg/day acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day ) use continuously patient . Surgeon blind sonolysis sham procedure . Magnetic resonance image Magnetic resonance imaging perform patient enrol substudy . Magnetic resonance image protocol consist 4 sequence : 1 . T2TSE ; 2 . DWI . Sequences 1 - 3 applied level , slice thickness cut number . The slice thickness comprise cut thickness ( 5 mm ) + distant factor ( 30 % ) . Standard number slice 19 . Standard slice level consider modified level skull base due minimalization distant artifact . Diffusion weight sequence show middle ( average ) diffusivity every point examine brain tissue b value 500 1000 . This sequence apply order ass hemorrhage ( T2*EPI ) monitor site reduce diffusion ( DWI , b=500 1000 ) ; 3 . T2 star-weighted gradient-recalled echo ( GRE ) sequence detection bleeding ( include microbleeds ) ; 4 . Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) .Presence new infarction evaluate separately whole brain , territory intervene ICA territory contralateral ICA . New ischemic lesion brain define hyperintense lesion postintervention DWI sequence present pretreatment MRI . The volume new brain infarction measure manually . Infarct volumes calculate total hyperintense area single slice multiply effective slice thickness [ ( actual slice thickness + distance factor ) /interslice gap ] . Ischemic lesion brain evaluate two blinded investigator . All disagreement resolve consensus . The third blinded investigator involve case persistent disagreement . Clinical examination Standard physical neurologic examination perform CEA , 24 hour , afte30 day 1 year CEA . Evaluation neurologic deficit perform use National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) ( see Appendix ) modify Rankin scale ( see Appendix ) CEA , 24 hour , 30 day 1 year CEA . Cognitive test Cognitive testing ( Addenbrooke 's Cognitive Examination Revised ( ACE-R ) , Mini Mental State Examination , Clock Drawing Test , Verbal Fluency Test ) perform , 24 hour , 30 day 1 year CEA . All cognitive test perform blinded investigator . Randomization Consecutive patient assign sonolysis control group computer-generated 1:1 randomization . Substudy : Patients indication CEA assign sonolysis control group computer-generated 1:1 randomization . ANALYSIS SETS Efficacy analyse perform primary intent-to-treat population .
