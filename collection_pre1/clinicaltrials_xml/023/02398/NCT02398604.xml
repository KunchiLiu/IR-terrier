	<brief_summary>This study intend evaluate safety feasibility intramyocardial injection allogeneic mesenchymal cell Bi-Directional Cavopulmonary Anastomosis ( BDCPA ) surgery hypoplastic leave heart syndrome ( HLHS ) pediatric patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic hMSC Injection Patients With Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label study , intend safety efficacy assessment prior full comparator study . In Phase I study , cell administer deliver 6-10 intramyocardial injection test 20 patient 10 patient controls total 30 HLHS patient . A total 30 patient HLHS enrol stag enrollment process . In open-labeled study , maximum 20 patient eventually receive intramyocardial injection allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell 10 control patient cell injection . The enrollment patient occur two stage group : Group A Group B . In Group A , 10 consecutive HLHS patient initially enrol allogenic MSCs treatment arm determine feasibility safety . After 6 month last enrolled patient Group A , Group A patient assessed order determine whether feasible safe , include harvesting , processing , administer allogeneic MSCs . Thereafter , Group B start enrol total 20 HLHS patient randomize treatment control arm 1:1 ratio , respectively , order 10 allogeneic MSCs-treated patient 10 control patient . At completion Phase I clinical study , total enrol cohort 20 patient treat allogeneic MSCs 10 patient control arm .</detailed_description>
