	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) chronic lung disease primarily cause smoking . COPD create tremendous burden healthcare system , disease exacerbation result frequent , prolonged hospitalization . While originally consider disease specific lung , data show COPD associate substantial cardiovascular ( CV ) morbidity mortality . Exacerbations COPD require hospitalization result mark patient deterioration , heighten CV risk . The cause increase CV risk stable COPD , exaggerate CV risk exacerbation disease unknown ; however , may due chronic inflammation exacerbate flare-up disease , and/or chronic inactivity similarly worsen bed-rest hospitalization . Despite impact COPD healthcare , relatively study examine COPD inpatient care impact patient outcome , inflammation CV risk . Disease management program , pulmonary rehabilitation patient self-management education , part guideline therapy COPD ; however , regularly implement follow hospitalization , intervention affect patient outcome , behavior , physical activity , inflammation CV risk well study . The propose long-term project examine early referral chronic disease management program hospital discharge , affect patient outcomes . This study provide invaluable information outpatient management disease tremendous impact healthcare .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examine Impact Early Education COPD Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To examine impact early pulmonary education ( PE ) follow hospital discharge QoL , pulmonary/CV outcome AECOPD hospitalization . Rationale : Studies show education improve self-efficacy QoL COPD . Whether improvement translate increase exercise tolerance , physical activity , reduce CV risk hospitalization patient recently discharge hospital require examination . Hypothesis : Patients receive early education improve QoL , pulmonary/CV outcome , less COPD hospitalization 6 month follow hospital discharge . Education improve self efficacy , physical activity QoL reduce CV risk compare usual care . Study Design &amp; Subject Recruitment : In Calgary , patient discharge follow AECOPD hospitalization refer Calgary COPD Asthma Program ( CCAP ) see Certified Respiratory Educator 1-2 time within month follow discharge . For study , patient recruit CCAP program randomize receive usual care ; general education session month follow discharge , experimental arm ; focus education follow discharge hospital . Patients find acute cardiac injury , mobility issue residence outside great Calgary area exclude . All education visit 1hr length , occur local outpatient clinic . The education focus patient self-management use Living Well COPD support literature ( www.livingwellwithcopd.com ) design improve patient self-management physical activity . All patient follow 6 month discharge interview assess disease status , management review history recurrence relapse AECOPD . Hospital admission length stay obtain electronic medical record describe . Patient assessment include : quality life , 6min walk , dyspnea , self-efficacy , physical activity , pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) , vascular function systemic inflammation ( TNF , MMP-2 , IL-6 CRP ) . All data collect , immediately 6 month education . The control group data collect scheduled time . See description method . Data Handling : Data enter onto secure anonymized database . Data Analysis : The influence education QoL , 6min walk , dyspnea , self-efficacy , physical activity , pulse wave velocity , vascular function systemic inflammation evaluate use multivariate mixed-model multivariate analysis variance ( MANOVA ) treatment ( education vs. usual care ) fix between-group variable time ( pre , immediate post , 6months post ) repeat variable . Sample size : Based previous work , total sample size 140 ( 70 group ) sufficient detect clinically significant difference QoL significant difference hospital readmission rate . Based outhe investigator r recent work , sample could detect 10 % difference PWV physical activity .</detailed_description>
