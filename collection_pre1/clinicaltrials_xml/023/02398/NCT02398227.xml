	<brief_title>Treatment PTSD Residents Battered Women 's Shelters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research suggest approximately 1 4 woman report history intimate partner violence ( IPV ) , IPV associate severe psychological problem , especially PTSD . Battered woman 's shelter annually provide emergency shelter approximately 300,000 woman child . A prime time intervene IPV victim might enter shelter already initiate change life . Standard shelter care typically include case management help woman access resource assist establish long-term safety child . However , PTSD symptom may compromise victim ' ability effectively use integral community resource , well ability appropriately react threat relevant information , interfere ability establish safety child . As , research find PTSD associate re-abuse victim IPV . Despite significant morbidity associate IPV-related PTSD , treatment , Helping Overcome PTSD Empowerment ( HOPE ) , extant treatment date develop specifically target IPV-related PTSD resident batter woman 's shelter . Cognitive-behavioral treatment ( CBT ) PTSD show effective multiple population address unique need recent IPV victim . HOPE , shelter-based , individual , brief CBT treatment PTSD victim IPV , address IPV victim ' current need safety , self-care , protection , empowerment , well exchange information PTSD symptom symptom interfere use shelter community resource ability establish safety . HOPE specifically design serve evidence-based model program could implement wide-range shelter program across United States . The current proposal build foundation NIMH-funded treatment development study ( R34MH080786 ) . Pilot work HOPE support initial acceptability feasibility new treatment . IPV victim receive significant dose HOPE 12 time less likely woman receive standard shelter service report re-abused leave shelter . Further , woman receive HOPE display few PTSD arousal avoidance symptom PTSD , less depression , great social support empowerment relative woman receive HOPE . The overall aim project test efficacy HOPE relative supportive therapy ( i.e. , Present Centered Therapy , PCT ) sample 186 female resident batter woman 's shelter IPV-related PTSD . In effort facilitate future dissemination HOPE , session deliver community therapist study conduct range shelter system . Furthermore , current proposal , unlike pilot study , compare HOPE attention match control condition , long follow-up period , assess impact HOPE child abuse potential , incorporate objective measure stress respond ( e.g. , attentional bias physiological reactivity trauma cue ) , explore mediator moderator treatment , evaluate cost effectiveness HOPE . The Specific Aim proposal conduct randomize control trial compare HOPE PCT resident batter woman shelter IPV-related PTSD . The study test follow hypothesis : Primary Hypotheses : HOPE significantly efficacious PCT reduce participant ' IPV-related PTSD symptom severity re-abuse one-year follow-up . Secondary Hypotheses : Associated Symptoms , Psychosocial Functioning , Cost : - HOPE significantly efficacious PCT decrease participant ' depressive symptom child abuse potential ; increase participant ' degree empowerment , quality life , degree quality social support , effective use resource , traumatic cognition one-year follow-up . - Shelter resident receive HOPE display reduce bias attention threat-related information normalization physiological reactivity trauma cue , relative woman receive PCT one-year follow-up . - We also plan evaluate cost-effectiveness HOPE measure cost per quality adjust life year save ( QULY ) . We also explore follow hypothesis regard potential mediator moderator HOPE : - The effect HOPE PTSD one-year follow-up mediate participant ' degree empowerment , effective use resource , traumatic cognition post-treatment . - HOPE participant ' PTSD symptom post-treatment mediate participant ' severity re-abuse one-year follow-up period . - We also plan explore whether follow baseline variable moderator treatment response : minority status , IPV PTSD severity , attentional bias threat relate information , physiological reactivity trauma cue .
