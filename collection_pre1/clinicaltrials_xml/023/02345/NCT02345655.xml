	<brief_summary>In France , General Practitioners ( GPs ) widely involve opiate maintenance treatment ( OMT ) initially prescribe buprenorphine monitoring patient buprenorphine methadone . Number treat patient around 150,000 75 % treated buprenorphine . Among guideline improve OMT , urine test mandatory initiate methadone , whereas recommend initiate buprenorphine follow-up . Urine drug test base immunoassay technique enable qualitative analysis recent drug consumption , detection base designate threshold , allow good appraisal drug exposure , initiate OMT . While intrinsic diagnostic value test already demonstrate , consequence carry test OMT clearly establish . Some study suggest patient exposed drug test may better OMT retention patient treat methadone , perform urine screening test show associated mortality risk reduction Scottish retrospective cohort opioid addict . Actually , despite recommendation perform test , GP prescribe test , patient regularly screen . Availability commercial kit urine drug test medical office improve utilisation . The widespread urine drug screening test use ambulatory care reality GPs work addictology network . Despite global benefit report literature good control prescribe OMT good patient ' adherence , far investigator know , study yet explore impact use urine drug screen test decision make general practice intervention study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In retrospective cohort study methadone user perform data obtain primary care prescription registry Tayside , Scotland , McCowan et al examine interaction patient related factor prescribe factor individual level assess independent impact risk all-cause mortality drug dependent cause specific mortality ( McCowan , Kidd et al . 2009 ) . Overall , 181 ( 8 % ) people die among 2378 subject median follow-up 4.38 year . Overuse methadone , history psychiatric admission , increase comorbidity associate increase all-cause mortality . Longer duration use ( adjust hazard ratio 0.95 , 0.94 0.96 ) , history urine test ( 0.33 , 0.22 0.49 ) , increase time since last filled prescription protective relation all-cause mortality . These factor likely marker people stabilise maintenance treatment engage monitoring procedure successfully complete methadone treatment reduction programme . This community base study give clear indication prescribing , monitoring , management patient OMT subsequent impact cause drug dependent mortality . This study provide evidence recommendation best practice ( include specifically perform UDS ) improve patient ' outcome . Using data French `` Methaville '' trial , Roux et al ( Roux , Michel et al . 2012 ; Roux , Lions et al . 2013 ) investigate effect pre-treatment in-treatment factor long-term non-adherence OMT . Four pre-treatment predictor non-adherence identify : female , stable housing , alcohol consumption cocaine use . These finding highlight need appropriately assess psychoactive drug use start OMT , urine drug test consider way reach aim . On basis literature , one would suppose carry UDS would provide improvement management patient abuse addiction would helpful , particularly community office-based setting , office-based management opioid dependence grows ( Walley , Alperen et al . 2008 ) . Despite lack significant evidence efficacy , UDS recommend ass use psychoactive substance abuse addiction suspect .</detailed_description>
