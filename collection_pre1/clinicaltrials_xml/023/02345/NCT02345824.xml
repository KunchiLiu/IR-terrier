	<brief_summary>This single-institution , open-label , early-phase study assess ability ribociclib ( LEE011 ) inhibit CDK4/CDK6/Rb/E2F signal cell proliferation/viability core infiltrate tumor tissue obtain patient recurrent glioblastoma anaplastic glioma compare baseline/primary pathologic tumor specimen . Abundant preclinical evidence indicate Rb-deficient cancer cell resistant CDK4/6 inhibition ongoing trial CDK4/6 inhibitor exclude patient Rb-deficient tumor . The investigator evaluate 10 patient Rb-positive glioblastoma anaplastic glioma study . Given minority glioblastoma ha Rb loss investigator anticipate enrol maximum 20 patient , meet goal 10 patient Rb-positive tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early-Phase Study Assess Inhibitor Ribociclib Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Anaplastic Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary evaluation efficacy determination ribociclib safety profile patient brain tumor study . All patient treat ribociclib ( 600 mg/day ) 8-21 day surgical resection recurrent tumor . Rb status recurrent tumor determine immunohistochemistry within 2 week surgery . Patients Rb-positive tumor continue treatment ribociclib ( 21 day , 7 day ) surgery . Patients treat unacceptable toxicity observe , disease progression assess radiographic clinical metric . We determine whether molecular marker associate change induce ribociclib treatment tumor ( match initial vs. recurrent tumor ) correlate progression-free survival . Approximately 20 % patient recurrent high-grade glioma undergo surgical resection tumor typically time first recurrence . These patient eligible study . An extra 10 mL blood collect routine clinical procedure prior initiation ribociclib treatment ( i.e. , baseline blood sample ) , separate plasma buffy coat fraction , frozen pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analysis . Patients treat ribociclib 8-21 day prior surgery identify drug effect tumor cell , determine drug PK . The last presurgical dose ribociclib administer day surgery 4-8 hour prior surgery allow sufficient time drug enter tumor cell , inhibit CDK4/6 , modulate downstream effector . Blood acquire within 1 hour surgery ( close time surgery possible ) . Blood separate plasma buffy coat fraction , frozen . During surgery , sample brain tumor core infiltrate brain tumor acquire . Tissue sample frozen fix paraffin embed block histology PK molecular analysis .</detailed_description>
