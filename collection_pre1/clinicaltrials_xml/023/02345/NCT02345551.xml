	<brief_summary>This project assess feasibility 12-week physical activity program develop specifically female expose know occupational carcinogen - shiftwork . Physical activity show decrease cancer risk , investigator research find female shift worker face unique barrier participate physical activity . This project use combination telephone-based behavioural counseling session physical activity coach , innovative web-based physical activity track software use Fitbit website smartphone app address commonly report barrier physical activity female shift worker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Physical Activity Intervention Female Shift Workers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently 4.1 million Canadians employ shiftwork . Shiftwork , define organization work time cover usual 8-hour workday 24-hour period , prevalent health care , emergency service , manufacturing , retail hospitality . Given grow demand good service hour today 's society , number shift worker unlikely decrease . There emerge evidence shiftwork many negative health implication , include high risk cancer chronic disease . A recent systematic review member investigator study team report preliminary evidence change shift schedule , time exposure bright light night shift , pharmacological therapy sleep , help improve sleep marker circadian rhythm dysfunction shift worker . However change shift schedule , exposure bright light may difficult implement certain workplace ( i.e. , specific hospital environment , police patrol car ) long-term effect pharmacological therapy unknown . To date limit research effective health promotion strategy occupational group , face unique challenge engage health behaviour change . There urgent need develop evaluate intervention improve health reduce cancer risk high-risk population . Participation regular physical activity know decrease risk cancer chronic disease , may simple cost-effective intervention could implement workplace individual worker mitigate increase risk . Shift worker unique barrier participate physical activity ; therefore feasibility implementing intervention must first investigate . Objective 1 : To assess feasibility 12-week telephone web-based physical activity intervention female shift worker , include recruitment , retention , adherence acceptability intervention . Objective 2 : To explore change physical activity ( min/week ) , health behaviour ( i.e. , sedentary time , sleep ) , quality life may occur intervention preparation full randomize control trial ( RCT ) intervention find feasible . Research Methods : As aim study evaluate feasibility , investigator use single-group pre-post intervention design . The behaviour change intervention promote increase min/week moderate-vigorous physical activity guide Health Action Process Approach ( HAPA ) model . This model aim promote behaviour change increase self-efficacy intention , plan maintenance physical activity . The goal participant meet Canada 's Physical Activity Guidelines adult 150 min/week moderate-vigorous physical activity . As compliment behavioural counseling session , participant ask track physical activity . All participant give FitBit wrist-worn activity monitor ( www.fitbit.com ) monitor step count , distance cover , active minute also track sleep . The FitBit synchronize wirelessly participant ' computer and/or smartphones , thus minimize need daily data entry track participant .</detailed_description>
