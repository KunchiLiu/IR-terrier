	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well combination chemotherapy work treat patient pancreatic cancer undergo surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan hydrochloride , oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil ( FOLFIRINOX ) , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Folfirinox Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma - A Phase II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility preoperative FOLFIRINOX resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety toxicity preoperative FOLFIRINOX . II . To determine response rate . III . To determine proportion achieve major pathologic response - per College American Pathologists ( CAP ) criterion . IV . To determine proportion achieve R0 resection . V. To determine perioperative ( 30-day ) mortality . VI . To determine role cancer antigen ( CA ) 19.9 potential prognostic and/or predictive biomarker . VII . To determine progression-free survival . VIII . To determine overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive FOLFIRINOX regimen comprise irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute , oxaliplatin IV 120 minute , leucovorin calcium IV 120 minute , fluorouracil IV 1-2 minute continuously 46 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
