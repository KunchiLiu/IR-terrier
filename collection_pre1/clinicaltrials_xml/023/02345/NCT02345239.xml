	<brief_title>Impact Pantoprazole 24-H Glycemic Control Post-prandial Glucose Excursion Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus complex chronic disease associate absolute insulin deficiency type1 diabetes progressive deterioration b-cell function type 2 diabetes . The pathophysiology type 2 diabetes include classical insulin resistance muscle liver progressive b-cell failure also accelerate lipolysis , incretin deficiency/resistance , hyperglucagonemia , renal increase glucose reabsorption , brain insulin resistance . Finally , hyperglycemia type 1 2 diabetes result absolute relative deficit pancreatic b -cell mass . Gastrin long consider candidate incretin hormone , i.e . enteral factor responsible 2-fold increase insulin secretion glucose ingest orally administer intravenously match peripheral glucose level . In healthy human , acute administration gastrin achieve supraphysiological level lead modest release insulin basal glucose condition pronounce potentiation insulin release coadministered glucose . With identification gastric inhibitory polypeptide , know glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide , subsequently glucagon-like peptide-1 potent incretin hormone whose secretion may impair type 2 diabetes , attention largely shift away gastrin play important role enteroinsular axis . Like gastric inhibitory polypeptide glucagon-like peptide-1 , gastrin also show induce b-cell proliferation neogenesis various model system , also appear increase insulin content individual cell . Zollinger Ellison 's original description peptic ulcer disease attributable purport gastrinoma include one case `` pancreatic tissue remove tumor show normal island many large cells… '' . Examination another case resect pancreas adjacent antral gastrinoma `` show marked proliferation duct islet tissue '' `` development islet cell ( nesidioblasts ) within duct epithelium . Gastrin demonstrate islet growth factor ( like glucagon-like peptide , epidermal growth factor , transform growth factor ) able restore functional b-cell mass diabetic animal . This combination drug therapy , specifically sitagliptin pantoprazole , induce b-cell neogenesis adult human pancreatic cell implant NOD-severe combined immunodeficient mouse . The increased b-cell mass appear derive pancreatic exocrine duct cell . PPIs also demonstrate positive effect glycemic control model type 2 diabetes—Psammomys obesus . In study PPI lansoprazole significant glucose-lowering effect animal model type 2 diabetes , effect likely mediate increase endogenous gastrin level . In summary basic research demonstrate gastrin consider important regulator b-cell neogenesis glucose homeostasis . Neogenesis process transdifferentiation appear activate severe injury endocrine exocrine pancreatic tissue , strong additional stimulus like GLP-1 and/or gastrin provide . All retrospective study show antidiabetic property PPIs global glucose-lowering power around 0.6-0.7 % point HbA1c , level evidence available literature still high . Moreover , study endogenous hypergastrinemia support incretin effect gastrin man . All basic research show gastrin significant role BG control Beta cell proliferation , increase insulin secretion particularly post prandial peak incretin like action . The finding study provide modest support proposition PPIs may useful adjunctive therapy type 2 diabetes . The postulated mechanism effect PPI cause elevation serum gastrin , enhance pancreatic β-cell function , stimulate increased insulin secretion . Proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) raise serum gastrin concentration significantly therefore , affect glucose metabolism promote b-cell regeneration/expansion also enhance insulin secretion . The result different observational study show anti-diabetic property PPIs global glucose-lowering power around 0.6-0.7 % point HbA1c . Small clinical trial prove PPI significant impact fast blood glucose , HbA1C , C-peptides beta cell mass . In trial significant drop fast blood glucose 12 week PPI post prandial immediate effect explore . The purpose study demonstrate immediate impact pantoprazole 24-H glycemic control post-prandial glucose excursion patient type 2 diabetes . This study extend 12 week period see long term impact PPI post prandial glucose HbA1C . If data support previous animal , observational clinical study result , PPIs could become new anti-diabetic agent good safe profile type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
