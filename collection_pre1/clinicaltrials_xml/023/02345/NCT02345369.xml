	<brief_summary>The purpose study look effect lock lock set screw place rod screw device thigh bone hip fix hip fracture . The set screw extra screw device allow screw go ball ball socket joint hip slide relation rod thigh bone , go . It know whether good lock set screw ( allow slide hip screw ) leave unlock ( allow slide hip screw ) . Participants study patient intertrochanteric hip fracture receive standard care injury ( lining fracture normal position insert rod thigh bone screw go rod ball ball socket hip ) . Patients consent participate randomize one two arm : 1 . Set screw unlocked 2 . Set screw lock . Participants get standard postoperative care standard postoperative xrays .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Locked Versus Unlocked Set Screws Intramedullary Fixation Intertrochanteric Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intramedullary hip screw device insert without lock set screw , purpose set screw minimize shorten femoral neck rigidly position head screw insert femoral head . Rigid lock lag screw may also limit ability fracture fragment compress gradually weight bearing potentially could reduce heal fracture site . Alternatively , settle fracture site may allow reliable heal allow shorten femoral neck fracture site . Shortening femoral neck fracture result gait disturbance poor hip function , delay heal contribute hardware failure need revision surgery . The benefit placing set screw intramedullary hip screw fixation clearly establish literature . To date , study address question , decision lock , lock screw base individual surgeon discretion . This study help clarify decision point treatment intertrochanteric hip fracture Intertan ( Smith Nephew , Memphis , Tn ) intramedullary nail . This lead well patient outcome , help clarify standard care common fracture pattern . Subjects sustain intertrochanteric hip fracture ( OTA classification A2 A3 ) randomize undergo fixation intramedullary hip screw without lock set screw . These subject blind study group treat per standard care fixation hip fracture xrays immediately surgery , 1-2 week , 6 week , 3 6 month post operatively . As per standard care additional xrays would indicate union fracture delay healing . Femoral neck shorten measure radiographically femoral neck offset femoral neck shaft angle measure radiographically base standardize computerized measurement xray image . TraumaCad software ( Voyanthealth , Westchester , Il ) utilize obtain standardized measurement . A blinded subinvestigator review participant ' x-ray make measurement require determine study outcomes . Time radiographic union occurrence hardware failure , nonunion malunion note . Demographic data include age , gender , smoke history , medical comorbidities collect base chart review . Subjective outcome score ( modify Harris hip score ) collect 3 6 month surgery .</detailed_description>
