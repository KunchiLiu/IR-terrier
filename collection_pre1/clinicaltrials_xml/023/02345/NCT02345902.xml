	<detailed_description>Background Delirium cognitive disorder affect attention mental function . It acute onset ( hour day ) , fluctuate course various condition factor disease withdrawal intoxication syndrome . Delirium syndrome multifactorial origin , commonly present elderly patient , prevalence 20 % . Delirium develop basal vulnerability interacts precipitate factor . Delirium three type accord psychomotor presentation , hyperactive ( agitate ) , hypoactive ( tranquil ) mixed . Delirium serious outcome , prolong hospitalization ( 1 ) , cognitive decline dementia ( 2,3,4 , ) , posttraumatic stress disorder ( 5 ) high mortality ( 1 ) . A neurotransmitter imbalance acetylcholine dopamine explain delirium symptom . A dopamine excess various consequence : hallucination present 51 % , delusion , present 43 % hypoactive delirium . These symptom produce acute stress patient caregiver . It report 53.5 % patient recall episode delirium , 55 % recall associated hallucination 95 % delusion . Family recall event stressful 66 % , nurse 65 % hallucination 88 % ( 6 ) . Hallucinations delusion risk factor development posttraumatic stress disorder , occur 22 % patient . Dopamine increase associate apoptosis neurotoxic effect . Inflammation role delirium . A study demonstrate cortisol , Interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) protein S100 calcium bind protein B ( S 100β ) associate delirium ( 7 ) . It important note antipsychotic may neuro-protective effect block dopamine receptor , , therefore , diminish potential negative outcome associate dopamine excess . Furthermore observational study use haloperidol intensive care unit decrease mortality , possibly effect inflammation , inhibit release proinflammatory cytokine ( 8 ) . One effect haloperidol vitro induction interleukin receptor antagonist ( IL-IRA ) , show independent role delirium . IL-IRA block action Interleukin 1α ( IL-1α ) interleukin 1β ( IL-Iβ ) . IL-IRA also downregulates ischaemic excitotoxic damage ( 9 ) . Treatment Delirium Psychiatrist , Geriatricians Neurologists , usually , treat delirium ; however treatment strategy vary widely among discipline , due difference practice guideline local application current knowledge among center . An integration treatment approach could offer important clinical advantage . To refer difference , The American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) Guidelines ( 10 ) recommend treatment antipsychotic elderly patient . Where haloperidol gold standard , dose 0.25 0.50 mg every 4 hour , although dose may need increased patient severely agitate . There mention among subtypes delirium . This guideline recognize non-pharmacologic intervention part treatment . On hand , Geriatrics Guidelines treatment delirium , mention treatment delirium mainly base non-pharmacologic treatment . Restricting pharmacologic treatment patient severe manifestation agitation ( 11 ) . The NICE Guidelines mention pharmacologic treatment hypoactive delirium patient indicate one week patient distress due hallucination ( 12 ) . Authors mention non-pharmacologic measure assess clinical trial , pharmacologic treatment recommend time ( 13 ) . Furthermore , others address currently , treatment antipsychotic use non-pharmacologic measure fail treat psychotic symptom . Or safety patient others compromise , clinical trial antipsychotic ( 14 ) . As mentioned , standardized treatment delirium among different discipline . Therefore , still debate determine best strategy treat delirium . As far know , clinical trial adequately evaluate haloperidol cornerstone management hypoactive delirium . Nonetheless , patient expose high dose haloperidol improve significantly antipsychotic ( 15 ) . Therefore , know whether hypoactive delirium ( frequent difficult recognize ) treat haloperidol low dos . Or haloperidol use mixed hyperactive type delirium . Though despite study include patient hypoactive delirium suggest antipsychotic may role treatment delirium subtype ( 16 ) . Statement Problem Hypoactive delirium common condition hospitalize elderly patient . It common type delirium carry difficulty diagnosis . It associate longer hospital stay , increase expense associate diagnosis doubt efficacious treatment strategy . Surprisingly , even hypoactive delirium frequent , hyperactive type paradigm study , one specifically mention treatment guideline . To best knowledge , study evaluate specifically haloperidol hypoactive delirium . Some study exclude type delirium systematically include delirium subtypes hypoactive delirium poorly represented/analyzed . Significance Investigation There clinical study correctly design , exempt methodological flaw evaluate important clinical outcome delirium patient general . There randomized clinical trial ( RCTs ) test low-dose haloperidol non-pharmacologic measure treatment hypoactive delirium . Just study include patient hypoactive delirium vary result , contribute lack uniform recommendation ( 16 ) . Currently , treatment base particular experience clinical center without measure impact relevant outcome . Furthermore , study evaluate perceived stress patient caregiver , well posttraumatic stress hypoactive delirium patient . None evaluate cognitive decline hypoactive delirium treat either antipsychotic non-pharmacologic measure . The purpose present RCT bring knowledge different treatment elderly patient hypoactive delirium .</detailed_description>
