	<brief_summary>The purpose study establish range pelvic floor pressure group woman , include woman without pelvic pain , compare change perineometer measurement rest maximum pelvic floor contraction woman without pelvic pain . Purpose also determine whether rest pelvic floor perineometer measurement correlate severity pain symptom woman chronic pelvic pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Perineometer Assess Pelvic Muscle Tone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic pelvic pain ( CPP ) define non-cyclic pelvic pain last least 6 month . Approximately 3-15 % woman affect CPP . Care patient CPP contribute considerable healthcare cost , account 880 million dollar annually outpatient visit alone . Although CPP may multifactorial , many woman contribution increase pelvic floor tone . CPP due increase pelvic floor tone usually refer levator spasm high tone pelvic floor dysfunction . Levator tenderness increase pelvic tone may identify physical exam . However , physical exam somewhat subjective may vary base clinician perform exam . There currently validate , objective measure judge rest pelvic tone , 1 ) limit objective assessment research study 2 ) limit ability assess response new treatment modality . The ability contract pelvic floor may assess pelvic exam Brink 's score . However , still elements subjectivity component score researcher continue look objective measure pelvic floor muscle tone . The Peritron perineometer device show correlate well pelvic floor contraction , base Brinks scores.Measurements take Peritron device well inter-rater reliability measure pelvic floor contraction , make attractive tool clinical research . However , use clinical research hamper lack normative data perineometer measurement . Though study use perineometer ass resting ( i.e . non-contracted ) pelvic tone therapy pelvic pain , study assess typical perineometer measurement woman levator spasm , data guide measurement may compare woman normal pelvic floor examination . We hypothesize : 1 ) Women high rest pelvic tone perceive exam high perineometer measurement woman normal pelvic tone exam low perineometer measurement , regardless whether report pelvic pain . 2 ) Women high rest perineometer measurement minimal change perineometer score rest maximum pelvic floor contraction ( squeeze ) . 3 ) In woman clinical evidence levator spasm , rest perineometer measurement correlate severity pelvic pain symptom . We plan investigate hypothesis execute follow specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : To compare clinical assessment rest pelvic tone perineometer measurement range woman , include without pelvic pain . Specific Aim 2 : To compare change perineometer measurement rest maximum pelvic floor contraction woman without pelvic pain . Specific Aim 3 : To determine whether rest pelvic floor perineometer measurement correlate severity pain symptom , measure short form McGill questionnaire score visual analog scale ( VAS ) , subset woman pelvic pain clinical evidence levator spasm .</detailed_description>
