	<brief_title>Olaparib Cediranib Maleate Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate association BROCA-homologous recombination ( HR ) clinical activity cediranib maleate ( cediranib ) /olaparib , measure progression-free survival ( PFS ) , woman recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer II . To assess clinical activity cediranib/olaparib , measure objective response , woman recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall survival ( OS ) , objective response , clinical benefit ( stable disease [ SD ] response &gt; = 16 week ) woman platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer , PFS , OS , clinical benefit woman platinum-resistant ovarian cancer . II . To assess safety cediranib/olaparib woman recurrent platinum-sensitive -resistant ovarian cancer . III . To evaluate association circulate endothelial cell baseline day 3 clinical activity cediranib/olaparib , measure PFS , woman platinum-sensitive -resistant ovarian cancer . IV . To evaluate change BROCA-HR status archival pre-treatment biopsy sample . V. To evaluate associate BROCA-HR clinical activity cediranib/olaparib measure PFS , woman platinum-resistant ovarian cancer . VI . To characterize genomic alteration whole exome sequence woman platinum-sensitive -resistant ovarian cancer . VII . To identify biomarker signature correlate clinical activity cediranib/olaparib woman recurrent platinum-sensitive -resistant ovarian cancer , include change gene expression acquire mutation on-treatment tumor biopsy associate clinical activity , change gene expression acquire mutation post-progression biopsy associate clinical resistance . VIII . To explore change biomarker signature candidate angiogenic marker pre-treatment post-progression woman platinum-sensitive -resistant ovarian cancer . IX . To evaluate population pharmacokinetics ( PK ) combination cediranib olaparib ( tablet ) platinum-sensitive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility mobile phone application ( app ) ecediranib-olaparib ( eCO ) collect patient-generated blood pressure symptom data base upon study protocol recommendation . II . Assess patient health care professional perceive usability satisfaction eCO app ( patient ) connect web portal ( health care provider ) . III . Assess number generate alert study team ( via web portal email `` high '' alert ) base pre-determined severity level . OUTLINE : Patients receive olaparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) cediranib maleate PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
