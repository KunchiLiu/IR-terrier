	<brief_summary>This post market registry consist retrospective prospective part . The first part retrospective registry implant IBE device Gore Netherlands CE mark obtain , get initial insight feasibility safety procedure . The second part prospectively register data implant IBE Gore device , order gain robust data efficacy device maintain hypogastric artery patency .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iliac Branch Excluder ReGistry ( IceBERG )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : The Gore IBE device newly design iliac branch device , use combination widely accept C3 Excluder endograft exclusion common iliac aneurysms aorto-iliac aneurysm . The late proven safety efficacy exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm . The Gore IBE device get CE mark October 2013 . Technical clinical data short long term still collect give insight technical success rate , patency data long term follow-up . Objective design : This investigator-initiated post market registry consist retrospective prospective part . The first part retrospective registry implant IBE device Gore Netherlands CE mark obtain , get initial insight feasibility safety procedure . The second part prospectively register data implant IBE Gore device , order gain robust data efficacy device maintain hypogastric artery patency . Study population : All patient Gore IBE implant . In retrospective part study implantation Netherlands gather , whereas prospective part expand Europe . Main study parameters/endpoints : Aneurysm exclusion reinterventions end-points study . As safety feasibility main outcome retrospective part , data analyze 30-days . Patients prospective study follow 5 year , primary end-point hypogastric side branch patency 1-year . Clinical endpoint include freedom symptom pelvic ischemia ( buttock claudication , impotence bowel ischemia ) freedom aneurysm rupture . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Since registry study , burden risk exist patient . There also direct benefit participate patient , gather data improve insight patient disease might improve health care future group patient .</detailed_description>
