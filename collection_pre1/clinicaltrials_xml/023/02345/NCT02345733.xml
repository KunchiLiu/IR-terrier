	<brief_title>Use Novel Diet ( UC DIET ) Treatment Mild Moderate Active Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis chronic inflammatory disease primarily involve colon . It long consider due dysregulated immune response target colon , involve unknown environmental factor . Recent study highlight several characteristic may suggest UC associated alteration microbiota , defective production short chain fatty acid impair mucous layer . However present , effective therapy target microbiota interaction colonic epithelium . UC humans characterize increased mucosal sulfide increase sulfate sulfide reduce bacteria activation amino acid metabolism pathway impair butyrate production , whereas certain dietary pattern human rodent model may induce dysbiosis favor sulphide reduce bacteria . Further support target microbiota include several study demonstrate antibiotic might helpful severe refractory colitis . Development treatment strategy target microbiota could reduce exposure immune suppression , add new therapeutic strategy exist present . Though diet significant impact composition microbiota dietary intervention date proven effective induction remission . The investigator hypothesize ulcerative colitis cause series event involve dysbiosis sulfate sulfide reduce bacteria combine defective production short chain fatty acid , couple defective mucous layer .</detailed_description>
