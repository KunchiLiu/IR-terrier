	<detailed_description>Varicose vein common problem World . From epidemiological study know quarter adult population suffers sort varicose vein . Women suffer two three time often varicose vein men . The occurrence varicose vein increase increase age one top ten complaint patient visit general practitioner . De main risk factor develop varicose vein endure stand sit , pregnancy , female gender age . Symptoms diver vary cosmetic complaint difficult treat venous ulcer . Last year endovenous technique develop primary treatment insufficient varicose vein . Radiofrequent ablation ( RFA ) , besides endovenous laser ablation ( EVLA ) , accept technique frequently apply clinical practice . This technique , use heat , important advantage treatment perform use slight local anaesthesia . Besides , RFA cause less hematoma , pain , superior cosmetic patient able restart daily activity sooner compare classical surgical treatment . Because RFA use heat technology , damage occur surround tissue . That reason use tumescent anaesthesia , multiple injection need . A column liquid place surround vein . Many patient experience column inconvenient despite form anaesthesia part treat patient population experience pain treatment last week . A new endovenous technique mechano-chemical ablation ( MOCA ) develop , use ClariVein system . This technique use intentional mechanical damage endothelium vene mean rotate catheter . At time sclerosans inject , result vene occludes . So technique use heat technology . Tumescent anaesthesia therefore need complication relate technique use heat ( RFA EVLA ) burning , pain , hematoma , induration , paresthesia could reduce even prevent . MOCA prove safe effective alternative treatment insufficient great saphenous vein ( GSV ) small saphenous vein ( SSV ) . Especially treatment below-knee GSV treatment superficial branch ( antero-lateral branch ) , risk damage nerve close proximity vein . In series 50 patient treat EVLA insufficient GSV knee , technical success 100 % report median follow-up 7 month , accompany nerve damage 8 % . A recent study evaluate MOCA treatment SSV report anatomical success 96 % without nerve damage major complication . Therefore , MOCA could alternative treatment various insufficient varicose vein segment without cause nerve damage . The choice treatment patient knee GSV insufficiency nowadays endovenous ablation above-knee segment . However , Theivacumar co-worker recently show patient significant residual reflux approximately 41 % treated leg . These patient clearly show less clinical improvement approximately 90 % patient need additional treatment . Up unknown whether treatment MOCA yield comparable result use treat insufficient GSV diameter &gt; = 12 mm , insufficient antero-lateral branch insufficient GSV knee . The goal registry study provide insight safety efficacy treatment describe insufficient varicose vein segment .</detailed_description>
