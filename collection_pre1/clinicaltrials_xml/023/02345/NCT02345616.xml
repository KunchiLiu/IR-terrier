	<brief_summary>The pulmonary hypertension ( HTP ) due leave heart disease hypoxemiant lung disease frequent cardiac surgery . The HTP represent independent risk factor morbidity mortality cardiac surgery , enter criterion Euroscore evaluation ( European System Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation ) . An acute perioperative hemodynamic decompensation patient frequent . Perioperative hemodynamic modification , hypoxemia , hypercapnia , sympathetic stimulation , increase pulmonary vascular resistance ( RVP ) might provoke right ventricular failure . The anesthetic induction begin mechanical ventilation sensible time due risk hemodynamic decompensation . The suppression sympathetic tonus consequence anesthetic induction , decrease systemic vascular resistance lead decrease blood pressure . In return , anesthetic induction associate increase pulmonary vascular resistance , result increase postcharge work right ventricle ( VD ) . These systemic pulmonary hemodynamic modification lead equalization , even inversion systemic pulmonary pressure . As consequence , hemodynamic collapse even heart arrest arise . The patient suffer HTP hypoxemic . They limit oxygen reserve due decrease functional residual capacity ( CRF ) . The apnea period , follow anesthetic induction , often associate fast desaturation , even good pre-oxygenation perform . This desaturation cause increase pulmonary vascular resistance hemodynamic consequence previously mention . A risk hypoxic heart arrest also present . Nitric Oxide ( NO ) endogenous mediator produce vascular endothelium . The NO powerful vasodilator use intensive care inhaled way selective pulmonary vasodilator ( iNO ) . NO decrease RVP , shunt effect improve oxygenation optimization ventilation-perfusion ratio . The short lifetime iNO ( 6sec approximately ) allow fast metabolism without induce undesirable effect systemic hypotension . No study , , investigate use iNO pre-oxygenation anesthetic induction cardiac surgery . We hope demonstrate iNO use oxygenation anesthetic induction beneficial effect respiratory cardiovascular parameter . Our objective estimate feasibility tolerance iNO anesthetic induction patient moderate severe HTP program cardiac surgery extracorporeal circulation . The effect estimate term efficiency ( hemodynamic respiratory optimization ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Nitric Oxide ( NO ) Pre-oxygenation Before Anesthetic Induction Patients With Pulmonary Hypertension Cardiac Surgery . Pilot Study Feasibility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before anesthetic induction every include patient follow protocol : - Standard monitoring ( ECG Electrocardiogram , SpO2 Pulsed oxygen saturation ) - Insertion radial arterial line periferic IV line local anesthesia , - Insertion internal jugular central line Swan Ganz catheter local anesthesia - Preoxygenation 100 % oxygen 10 min - Further preoxygenation mixture 100 % oxygen associate iNO dose 1,2 L / mn . - Anesthesia induction initiation mechanical ventilation . - Progressive decrease iNO dose stop iNO administration .</detailed_description>
