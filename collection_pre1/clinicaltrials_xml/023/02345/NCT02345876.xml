	<brief_summary>The hypothesis central auditory processing disorder advance explain anomaly grapheme/phoneme combination dyslexia . These phonological disorder may link abnormality efferent ( medial olivocochlear ) system modulation cortical asymmetry . Indeed , efferent system asymmetry relation handedness . Thus , right-handed subject , predominant right side . In contrast , subject-handed dyslexic , efferent system tend right-lateralized non-lateralized . However , audio-visual training , normal lateralization appear . This maturation efferent system lateralization read acquisition seem particular profile dyslexics phonological disorder , especially persistent . This finding allow consider new prognostic evaluation speech therapy rehabilitation dyslexic child .</brief_summary>
