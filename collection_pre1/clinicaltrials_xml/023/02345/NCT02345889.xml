	<brief_summary>Adenoma detection rate ( ADR ) validate marker reduce risk interval colorectal cancer screen colonoscopy . Recent study suggest novel device attach colonoscope tip may improve ADR doctor perform screening procedure</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A 4-arm Clinical Trial Fuse® , EndoCuff™ , EndoRings™ Standard Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study indicate continue medical education , time colonoscopy day , force long withdrawal time , use high definition colonoscope result improve ADR although gain modest . To end , add novel device tip colonoscope may improve ability doctor perform good procedure . We therefore propose identify increase ADR 3 device compare standard colonoscopy . Fuse colonoscopy ( 2 camera embed side colonoscope tip provide increased angle view ) , EndoCuff ( plastic cap fit tip flexible arm hold mucosa back aid inspection ) , EndoRings ( similar EndoCuff arm wider ) show tandem colonoscopy study improve adenoma miss rate 7-15 % instead miss rate see standard colonoscopy usually 40 % . All device FDA approve distribute United States .</detailed_description>
