	<detailed_description>Background The increase incidence muscular wasting , bone disease , fall related fracture price excellent survival rate transplant patient . Kidney recipient loose significant amount muscle mass skeleton mineral early post-transplantation period suffer increase abnormality neuromuscular function . Recently , stochastic whole-body vibration ( WBV ) receive much attention potential muscle-anabolic anti-osteoporotic intervention . It suggest randomized low-frequency signal produce train activate otherwise high threshold afferent efferent motor-neurons thus may result considerable neuromuscular activation . Additionally , data support peripherally-induced central biochemical activation , mean production CNS modulators due application mechanical exercise stochastic WBV . The result rapid ( within minute ) , transient force increase . Due high number stimuli-repetitions , possible increase muscle strength use short training time ( &lt; 5 min ) conventional physiotherapeutic method ( &gt; 30 min ) . Several experimental clinical study show addition muscle function , WBV also improve body balance bone mineral density . Moreover , population renal transplant recipient yet study elsewhere . WBV appeal approach , foremost subject limited physical activity ; represent potentially simple efficient train method skeletal muscle well functional performance , thus prevent fall consequently fracture . Objective Primary : - To determine effect post-transplantation stochastic WBV therapy preservation functional muscle strength . Secondary : To assess ) efficacy post-transplantation stochastic WBV body balance b ) efficacy post-transplantation stochastic WBV preservation lean muscle mass determine Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) c ) change bone turnover marker renal transplant recipient stochastic WBV therapy ) short-term safety stochastic WBV therapy renal transplant recipient . Methods Prospective , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled setting . Recruited individual randomize Group 1 ( intervention ) Group 2 ( placebo ) . All participant evaluate monthly occurrence fall fracture , treatment-associated side effect . Testing perform upon study entry 3 6 month accord follow schedule : Visit 1 ( Baseline ) : - Muscle strength measurement - Neuromuscular test ( SPPBT ) - Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) - Turnover Markers ( blood ) Visits 2 3 ( 3 6 month respectively ) : Identical visit 1</detailed_description>
