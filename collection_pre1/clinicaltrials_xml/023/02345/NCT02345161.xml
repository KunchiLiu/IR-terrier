The primary purpose study demonstrate improvement lung function health status subject treat FF/UMEC/VI compare budesonide/formoterol 24 week . Once-daily 'closed ' triple therapy Inhaled Corticosteroid/ Long-acting Muscarinic Receptor Antagonists/ Long Acting Beta-Agonist ( ICS/LAMA/LABA ) combination FF/UMEC/VI ( 100 mcg/62.5 mcg/25 mcg ) single device develop aim provide new treatment option management advance ( GOLD Group D ) COPD reduce exacerbation frequency , allow reduce burden polypharmacy , convenience , increase potential improvement lung function , Health Related Quality Life ( HRQoL ) symptom control establish dual/monotherapies . Subjects meet inclusion/exclusion criterion successfully complete protocol procedure Screening Visit enter two-week run-in period . Following run-in period , eligible subject randomise ( 1:1 ) one follow double-blind treatment group : FF/UMEC/VI 100 mcg/62.5 mcg/25 mcg via ELLIPTAâ„¢ dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) daily morning placebo via reservoir inhaler twice daily OR Budesonide/formoterol 400 mcg/12 mcg via reservoir inhaler twice daily placebo via ELLIPTA DPI daily morning . The target enrollment 1800 randomised subject approximately 200 study center globally . The total duration subject participation approximately 27 week , consist 2-week run-in period , 24-week treatment period 1-week follow-up period . Subjects run-in exist COPD medication 2 week addition provide short act albuterol/salbutamol use as-needed basis ( rescue medication ) throughout study .

	<criteria>Informed Consent : A sign date write informed consent prior study participation . Type subject : Outpatient . Age : Subjects 40 year age old Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Gender : Male female subject . A female eligible enter participate study : Nonchild bear potential ( i.e . physiologically incapable become pregnant , include female postmenopausal surgically sterile ) . Surgically sterile female define documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy tubal ligation . Postmenopausal female define amenorrhoeic great 1 year appropriate clinical profile , e.g . age appropriate , &gt; 45 year , absence hormone replacement therapy . OR Child bear potential , negative pregnancy test screening , agree one follow acceptable contraceptive method use consistently correctly ( i.e . accordance approve product label instruction physician duration study screen safety followup contact ) : Abstinence , Oral Contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone , Injectable progestogen , Implants levonorgestrel , Estrogenic vaginal ring , Percutaneous contraceptive patch , Intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) , Male partner sterilization ( vasectomy documentation azoospermia ) prior female subject 's entry study , male sole partner subject . For definition , `` document '' refers outcome investigator's/designee 's medical examination subject review subject 's medical history study eligibility , obtain via verbal interview subject subject 's medical record . ; Double barrier method : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) vaginal spermicidal agent ( foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ) COPD Diagnosis : An established clinical history COPD accordance definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society . Smoking History : Current former cigarette smoker history cigarette smoke &gt; 10 packyears Screening ( Visit 1 ) [ number pack year = ( number cigarette per day / 20 ) x number year smoke ( e.g. , 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year ) ] . Previous smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 . Note : Pipe and/or cigar use use calculate packyear history . Severity COPD symptom : A score &gt; =10 COPD Assessment Test ( CAT ) Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Severity Disease : Subjects must demonstrate Screening : &lt; postbronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 50 % predict normal OR postbronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict normal documented history &gt; =2 moderate exacerbation one severe ( hospitalize ) exacerbation previous 12 month . Subjects must also measure post albuterol/salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.70 screening . Note : Percent predict calculated use European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative reference equation . Note : A documented history COPD exacerbation ( e.g. , medical record verification ) medical record worsen COPD symptom require systemic/oral corticosteroid and/or antibiotic ( moderate exacerbation ) hospitalization ( severe exacerbation ) . Prior use antibiotic alone qualify exacerbation history unless use associate treatment worsen symptom COPD , increase dyspnoea , sputum volume , sputum purulence ( colour ) . Subject verbal report acceptable . Existing COPD maintenance treatment : Subject must receive daily maintenance treatment COPD least 3 month prior Screening .

The Principal Investigator ( PI ) determine clinical significance abnormal ECG find relation subject 's medical history exclude subject would undue risk participate trial . An abnormal clinically significant finding would preclude subject enter trial define 12lead tracing interpret , limited , follow : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) rapid ventricular rate &gt; 120 Beats Per Minute ( BPM ) ; sustain nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) ; Second degree heart block Mobitz type II third degree heart block ( unless pacemaker defibrillator insert ) ; QT interval correct heart rate Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) &gt; =500 millisecond ( msec ) subject QRS &lt; 120 msec QTcF &gt; =530 msec subject QRS &gt; =120 msec . Contraindications : A history allergy hypersensitivity corticosteroid , anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist , beta2agonist , lactose/milk protein magnesium stearate medical condition narrowangle glaucoma , prostatic hypertrophy bladder neck obstruction , opinion Investigator , contraindicate study participation . Cancer : Subjects carcinoma complete remission least 5 year . Subjects carcinoma situ cervix , squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma skin would exclude base 5 year wait period subject consider cured treatment . Oxygen therapy : Use longterm oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) describe rest oxygen therapy &gt; 3litres/minute ( L/min ) ( Oxygen use &lt; =3L/min flow exclusionary . ) Medication prior spirometry : Subjects medically unable withhold albuterol/salbutamol 4hour period require prior spirometry test study visit . Pulmonary rehabilitation : Subjects participate acute phase Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program within 4 week prior Screening subject plan enter acute phase Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program study . Subjects maintenance phase Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program exclude . Drug/alcohol abuse : Subjects know suspected history alcohol drug abuse within last 2 year . Noncompliance : Subjects risk noncompliance , unable comply study procedure . Any infirmity , disability , geographic location would limit compliance schedule visit . Questionable validity consent : Subjects history psychiatric disease , intellectual deficiency , poor motivation condition limit validity inform consent participate study . Affiliation investigator site : study investigator , subinvestigators , study coordinator , employee participate investigator study site , immediate family member aforementioned involved study . Inability read : In opinion investigator , subject unable read and/or would able complete study related material . Medication prior screen : No use follow medication within follow time interval prior Screening study . Long term antibiotic therapy : Subjects receive antibiotic long term therapy eligible study ( Antibiotics allow short term treatment exacerbation short term treatment acute infection ) ; Systemic , Oral , parenteral corticosteroid : 30 day ( Except study oral/systemic corticosteroid may use treat COPD exacerbations/pneumonia ) . Intraarticular injection allow . Any investigational drug : 30 day 5 half life whichever longer .</criteria>
