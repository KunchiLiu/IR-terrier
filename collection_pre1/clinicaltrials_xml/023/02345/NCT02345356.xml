	<brief_title>A Genomic Approach Warfarin Dose Prescription Admixed Caribbean Hispanics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite substantial number work publish past year different population around world , fundamental gap remain understand whether genomic admixture polymorphisms warfarin-related pharmacogenes account high inter-individual dose variability observe Caribbean Hispanic patient . In addition medically underserved population , often marginally represent clinical study , Caribbean Hispanics also genomically heterogeneous population whose high level admixture produce rich repertoire combinatorial genotype ( e.g. , CYP2C9*2/*5 + VKORC1-1639 A/A ) appear challenge current pharmacogenetic-driven prescribing model . Our project take novel approach definitively assess admixture component also highly practical incorporation customize pharmacogenetic algorithm implement `` real-world '' clinical setting web-based portal . Moreover , project also aim perform DNA-sequencing identify unknown variant candidate pharmacogenes ( i.e. , CYP2C9 VKORC1 ) may contribute explain dose variability Caribbean Hispanics . Shaped strong preliminary data SC2 pilot project , investigator assess clinical validity utility admixture-adjusted , pharmacogenetic-guided prescribing model personalize prediction effective warfarin dose Caribbean Hispanics , also encompass genetic ( common novel variant ) non-genetic clinical demographic factor . The study conduct 4 year 300 patient thromboembolic disorder receive warfarin . Four collaborating/recruiting site connect precise delivery genotyping result prescribe advice clinician via web-based portal . Our novel assessment genetic admixture quantify contribution European , African Amerindian ancestry , investigator test whether admixture component explain heritability currently miss response variability drug among Caribbean Hispanics . If successful target population , approach ultimately render current pharmacogenomic model clinical management relate thromboembolic condition accurate predictive population . The propose research advance expand understand clinically relevant variant affect response warfarin admixed population . Advancing knowledge important under-investigated area pharmacogenetics minority population generate result apply personalize oral anticoagulation therapy wider population move , inevitably , toward increase heterogeneity admix genome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Caribbean Hispanic origin ( e.g. , Puerto Ricans , Dominicans , Cubans ) , whose parent Caribbean Hispanics well Age ≥ 21 year ≤90 year . Willingness ability sign inform consent . Able follow 3 month . Expected duration warfarin therapy least 3 month . Anticoagulation management patient perform inhospital and/or outpatient clinician ( i.e. , participate Physicians , PharmD ) adhere study dose algorithms dosetitration plan . NonHispanic patient ( race/ethnicity selfreported patient ) Age &lt; 21 year &gt; 90 year . Currently take warfarin new oral anticoagulant ( e.g. , Xarelto , Pradaxa , Eliquis , Savaysa/Lixiana ) . Prior warfarin therapy know require stable dose . Clinician opinion warfarin dose need adjust reason account dose algorithm ( i.e. , age , gender , body size , comeds , comorbidities , diet , genetics , ancestry , INRs target INR ) . Abnormal baseline INR ( warfarin ) , e.g. , due liver disease , antiphospholipid antibody Contraindication warfarin treatment least 3 month . Life expectancy less 1 year . Pregnant woman childbearing woman use medically approve method birth control . Inability followup regular basis anticoagulation practitioner participate trial . Any factor likely limit adherence warfarin , ( e.g. , dementia , alcohol substance abuse , plan move next 3 month , history unreliability medication take appointment keep , significant concern participation study spouse , significant , family member , lack support primary health care provider ) . Sickle cell , HIVpositive/ AIDS patient Cognitive cause inability provide inform consent follow study procedure . Participating another trial prohibit participation current trial plan enrollment trial within first 3 month warfarin therapy . Anemia : reduction Hg ≥2g/dl within 48 hour randomization require blood transfusion . Creatinine Clearance ( CrCL ) ≤ 15 mL/min . Genotype ( CYP2C9 VKORC1 ) know participant prior testing .</criteria>
