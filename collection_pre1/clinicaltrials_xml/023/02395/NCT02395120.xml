	<brief_summary>The study multi-site , double blind , parallel arm , community-based randomize control trial ( phase III RCT ) evaluate effectiveness new referral approach increase receipt dental care among inner-city urban rural elementary school child screen school restorative treatment need . The study 5 arm : The experimental intervention use theoretically drive CSM referral letter alone , letter plus Dental Information Guide , reduce CSM referral letter alone , reduce CSM referral letter plus reduced Dental Information Guide . The control strategy use standard referral letter . All participate K-4 grade child receive screen begin school year study end point 7 month later determine child receive dental care . The primary aim evaluate effectiveness experimental ( new ) versus standard referral approach give parents/caregivers increase receipt dental care among child grade K-4 . The secondary aim ass change parent/caregiver illness representation/perception behavioral intention enrollment ( begin school year ) follow-up ( end school year ) understand underlie mechanism new vs. standard referral approach result receipt dental care . The hypothesis CSM-based intervention increase receipt dental care compare standard referral letter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose study evaluate effectiveness new referral approach increase receipt dental care among inner-city urban rural elementary school child screen school restorative treatment need . The primary outcome assessment dental care receipt dental exam . The secondary outcome change caregiver illness perception , measure IPQ-RD , behavioral intention measure item caregiver questionnaire . Study Design : The study utilize multi-site , double-blind , parallel arm , community-based randomized trial design . The experimental intervention base upon Common Sense Model Self-Regulation ( CSM ) address parent/caregiver illness perception navigation resource increase receipt dental care 7-month follow-up period child restorative dental need . In five arm study new CSM theory-driven referral letter alone , new CSM referral letter Dental Information Guide ( DIG ) , new CSM theory-driven reduce referral letter alone , new CSM theory-driven reduce referral letter reduce Dental Information Guide ( DIG ) compare standard referral letter increase receipt dental care among inner-city urban African American , rural Hispanic White elementary school child . Participants : Subjects parents/caregivers child grade K-4 one three school district ; East Cleveland City School District ( OH ) , Cowlitz County School Districts ( WA ) , Lewis County School Districts ( WA ) . The study offer caregiver child include child special health care need . At Ohio site , English-speaking caregiver child enrol English- Spanish-speaking caregiver child include Washington site . At begin school year dental screening , primary caregiver randomize child tooth International Caries Detection Assessment System ( ICDAS ) active lesion score 2 great . Caregivers multiple child K-4 receive intervention assignment . Procedures : Caregivers recruit begin school year complete baseline form ( consent form , Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised Dental ( IPQ-RD ) questionnaire , caregiver questionnaire ) prior dental screen randomization . Children K-4 whose parent consent receive screening exam early October 2015 . After screen exams , eligible caregiver child restorative referral randomize one five study arm . Different referral letter with/without Dental Information Guide accord study arm send home child day screen mail caregiver address within 24 hour . Caregivers follow 2 time point : 2 week receipt intervention letter 2 week prior final ( exit ) study visit examination May 2016 ( approximately 7 month initial dental exam ) . At time point caregiver complete IPQ-RD caregiver questionnaire . A small sub-sample 60 caregiver randomly sample three arm ( standard letter , intervention letter , intervention letter+DIG ) complete IPQ-RD 1 month enrollment fidelity purpose . All questionnaire mail home address ask returned class-room teacher outreach staff . Further , outreach staff ensure caregiver receive returned material follow-up call . Children follow-up dental exam May 2016 . Analysis Plan : Primary Statistical Analysis : Descriptive statistic include frequency ( categorical variable ) mean ( continuous variable ) baseline covariates among five intervention group . Chi-square test ( categorical variable ) t-tests ( continuous variable ) perform test group difference ( site overall ) . In primary analysis , fit multivariate generalize linear ( specifically , logistic regression ) model dental care receipt ( binary ) outcome child unit analysis ( receipt dental care determine child ) . A generalized estimating equation ( GEE ) approach ( exchangeable work correlation structure ) use allow correlation among multiple child give caregiver . Secondarily , fit model site intervention group interaction , latter test formally assess possible intervention effect heterogeneity site . We also consider work correlation structure ( e.g. , alternate logistic regression ) allow second-level cluster , namely school ( within first-level cluster , caregiver , nest ) . We determine final model base quasi-likelihood information criterion ( QIC ) . Intervention ( covariate ) effect test use generalize score statistic . Analysis Secondary Outcomes ( Questionnaire data ) : Summary statistic ( include mean standard error ) questionnaire responses IPQ-RD behavioral intention item within caregiver questionnaire calculate site intervention group . This do overall questionnaire ( IPQ-RD behavioral intention ) , five IPQ-RD cognitive construct , two behavioral intention question . Analyses do site overall ( control site ) . A summary measure approach , base mean questionnaire response , use compare questionnaire outcomes across intervention group , overall questionnaire construct . Specifically , construct ( overall ) linear regression model use mean response dependent variable , intervention group indicator select baseline ( control ) covariates independent variable . Inferences ( , p-values confidence interval ) perform assume summary measure normally distribute . This assumption test use Shapiro-Wilk statistic violate suitable transformation summary measure use nonparametric approach ( e.g. , use rank summary measure ) conduct . Missing Data : In event miss questionnaire response , first ass whether data miss completely random ( MCAR ) , , whether missingness give item dependent participant baseline characteristic item response . This do use generalized estimating equation ( GEE ) approach , , fit multivariate generalize linear ( e.g. , logistic regression ) model miss data indicator item , include explanatory variable select baseline covariates item response , test effect latter . If MCAR assumption deem reasonable ( significant effect find ) , conduct regression analysis mean outcome base available data . A weighted analysis ( , regression use weight least square criterion ) conduct adjust differential missingness ( thus , non-homogeneous summary measure variance ) among participant . If MCAR assumption find violate use multiple imputation approach ( conjunction summary measure approach ) use suitable imputation model ( i.e. , use item response ) . For construct ( overall ) perform F-test difference mean summary measure among three intervention group , obtain nominal 95 % confidence interval pairwise mean difference . If necessary , include random effect school . Data Management : Data study capture use examination , form , questionnaire , audio recording . Study data collect stored use REDCap platform . REDCap secure , web-based application design support remote data capture research study , provide : 1 ) intuitive interface validate data entry , 2 ) audit trail track data manipulation export procedure , 3 ) automate export procedure seamless data downloads common statistical package , 4 ) procedure import data external source . Study form complete study personnel paper , subsequently enter REDCap study staff . Because randomization contingent upon computer , paper randomization form complete . Paper form securely stored lock file cabinet site use . Completed paper form transfer site via courier secure document service .
