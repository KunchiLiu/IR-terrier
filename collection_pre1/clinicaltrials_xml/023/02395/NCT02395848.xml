	<brief_summary>This medical research study design look safety efficacy 30-day course fidaxomicin treatment recurrent CDI ( Clostridium difficile Infection ) . CDI infection result normal flora ( resident bacteria ) colon substantially alter antibiotic treatment . The decrease normal flora allow growth C. difficile bacteria . Fidaxomicin antibiotic approve Health Canada treatment CDI . Only patient primary case CDI 1st episode recurrent CDI study use 10-day course fidaxomicin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy 30-day Duration Fidaxomicin Recurrent C. Difficile Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clostridium difficile ( C. difficile ) infection ( CDI ) one frequent cause healthcare associated infection rate also grow community . The efficacy standard antibiotic especially recurrent CDI limit oral vancomycin metronidazole also suppress growth anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis group protect proliferation C. difficile . In contrast , vitro study show fidaxomicin negligible activity B. fragilis . The persistent disruption healthy colonic flora may reason recurrence follow course treatment metronidazole vancomycin . Fidaxomicin show reduce recurrence approximately 50 % compare oral vancomycin primary 1st episode recurrent CDI . Determining efficacy safety 30-day duration fidaxomicin recurrent CDI open label clinical trial important implication policy make related drug reimbursement program . In addition , result study instrumental demonstrate scientific healthcare community may role 30-day course fidaxomicin treatment modality recurrent CDI . Curing CDI restore health quality life individual patient level healthcare community well . Patients refractory CDI require prolong hospital admission , increase organism burden within healthcare facility . This turn lead spread infection vulnerable patient . If 30-day course fidaxomicin prove safe effective curing patient recurrent CDI , reduce risk severe complication patient reduce transmission CDI susceptible patient .</detailed_description>
