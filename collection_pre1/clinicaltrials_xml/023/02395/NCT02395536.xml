	<brief_summary>The primary purpose RIO 2 study demonstrate Reveal LINQ™ insertable cardiac monitoring ( ICM ) system record subcutaneous ECG insertion procedure perform in-office setting safe LINQ™ insertion perform traditional hospital setting ( operate room , cardiac catheterization electrophysiology ( EP ) laboratory ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medtronic Reveal LINQ™ In-Office 2 ( RIO 2 ) Study United States</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RIO 2 two arm , randomize , prospective , un-blinded , multicenter , non-significant risk study . The primary objective RIO 2 assess randomize subject receive LINQ™ insertion office set traditional hospital environment . Moving LINQ™ insertion procedure office setting expect decrease complication rate compare hospital insertion procedure , however , move LINQ™ insertion procedure traditional hospital setting may benefit patient reduce burden healthcare system .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patient indicate continuous arrhythmia monitoring Reveal LINQ™ Insertable Cardiac Monitor 2 . Patient 18 year age old 3 . Patient willing undergo ICM insertion procedure outside cath lab , OR , EP lab set local anesthetic 4 . Patient willing able provide consent authorize use disclosure health information 5 . Patient willing able comply protocol include require followup 1 . Patient unusual thoracic anatomy scar implant site may adversely affect success implant procedure 2 . Patient reduce immune function otherwise high risk infection per physician discretion 3 . Current therapy immunosuppressive agent chronic steroid use e.g . Prednisone great 20mg per day 4 .
