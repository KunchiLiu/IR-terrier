	<brief_summary>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) acquire retinal pathology affect central region retina responsible discrimination high spatial frequency ( read ) , colour vision central visual field . The loss visual acuity occur onset AMD significantly affect patient ' quality life . In developed country , AMD lead cause vision impairment people age 50 year . Its prevalence Europe people age 65 year 3.3 % . In France , around 2 million people suffer disease . In first stage disease know age-related maculopathy ( ARM ) . This early form disease develop intermediate AMD ( stage 3 AREDS classification ) advance AMD ( stage 4 AREDS ) , atrophic exudative . In case exudative AMD , intravitreal administration anti-VEGF drug limit disease 's progression . It therefore vital adopt strategy assess stage disease provide appropriate care management early possible stage . This even important patient advance AMD one eye intermediate AMD fellow eye , risk fellow eye progress advanced stage within 5 year 35 % 53 % . Microperimetry promise new diagnostic method combine measurement light sensitivity , loss fixation anatomy retina . It offer new approach functional assessment retinal damage patient AMD , precisely correlate anatomical functional modification measure loss sensitivity macular fixation . It show advanced patient 's AMD , parameter measure microperimetry norm . The investigator want assess MAIAâ„¢ mean screen AMD progression patient high risk progress advanced stage ( patient present one eye advance AMD fellow eye stage 3 AMD accord AREDS classification ) . The research hypothesis propose study parameter measure use microperimetry already show abnormal result study eye prior progress advanced stage disease . The use microperimetric parameter predictor progression would therefore make possible screen eye likely develop intermediate advanced AMD early stage , subsequently provide patient need early follow-up , preventive treatment adapt , personalize rehabilitation appropriate .</brief_summary>
