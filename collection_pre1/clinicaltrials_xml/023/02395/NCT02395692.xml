	<brief_title>Methoxyamine Temozolomide Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate efficacy TRC102 ( methoxyamine ) temozolomide , measure response rate , bevacizumab naïve glioblastoma . ( Arm I ) II . To estimate efficacy TRC102 temozolomide , measure response rate , bevacizumab refractory glioblastoma . ( Arm II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate toxicity oral TRC102 temozolomide patient population . II . Estimate efficacy TRC102 temozolomide , measure progression-free survival , progression-free survival 6 month overall survival , bevacizumab naïve glioblastoma . III . Estimate efficacy TRC102 temozolomide , measure progression-free survival bevacizumab refractory glioblastoma . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess tissue correlate N-methylpurine-deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) glycosylase ( MPG ) , topoisomerase II-alpha ( topo II ) , O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) status , response , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive methoxyamine orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) temozolomide PO QD day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 2 month 2 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
