	<brief_summary>Children experience high level anxiety immediately prior surgery . In fact , stressful part whole surgical experience child . Anxiety surgery associate problem surgery ; short-term increase need pain medication long-term sleep disturbance behaviour change . Child Life , program run North American child 's hospital develop way reduce child 's anxiety prior surgery . These technique include role-play story book amongst others . In study , investigator aim look benefit Child Life technique anxiety level child caregiver prior receive anesthesia operate room . The study include child age 3 10 year old , needing day case surgery last less 2 hour , never surgery . They randomly allocate either receive intervention Child Life receive Child Life intervention period prior surgery , wait Surgical Day Care Unit . Anxiety level child caregiver measure arrive hospital immediately prior anesthesia , see low level anxiety group receive Child Life intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Examine Effects Child Life Interventions Children 's Anxiety Levels Induction Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RESEARCH DESIGN : This prospective , randomize control clinical trial ass effectiveness immediate preoperative Child Life intervention reduce preoperative anxiety prior induction anesthesia . This prospective , randomize control clinical trial compare two group child undergo induction anesthesia . - Group 1 ( Standard Procedure ) receive BCCH standard care , consist topical anesthetic cream , wait parent playroom surgical daycare unit preoperatively , parental presence operating room ( OR ) , BC Children 's Hospital ( BCCH ) 'parent hug ' standard distraction technique - Group 2 ( Child Life ) receive Child Life intervention applicable individual patient , day surgery addition standard practice techniques The primary outcome measure score validate observer rating anxiety induction anesthesia . A trained research assistant ( RA ) observe score child 's anxiety use follow validated tool : - The modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale - short form ( m-YPAS-SF ) , design specifically assess preoperative anxiety child age 3 12 year , use real-time observational assessment child 's anxiety-indicating behaviour ( activity , vocalization , emotional expressivity state arousal ) . - The Perioperative Adult Child Behavioral Interaction Scale ( PACBIS ) , design real-time evaluation perioperative anxiety behaviour child parent , include child cop behaviours parent-positive/negative behaviour . STUDY PROCEDURES Baseline anxiety score randomization : On child 's arrival Surgical Day Care Unit ( SDCU ) , baseline observational anxiety score take RA ( t0 ) , use m-YPAS-SF . The RA leave SDCU prior randomization , carry Child Life specialist . Consented subject randomly assign one two group receive either Standard Procedure ( n = 30 ) Child Life ( n = 30 ) . Groups randomize use computer generate random number . In SDCU : Following baseline anxiety score randomization , child follow per SDCU policy . If child randomize receive Child Life intervention ( Group 2 ) , Child Life specialist carry intervention , prior child come OR . All process standard : anesthesiologist dentist make preoperative visit , analgesic premedication give , etc . Child Life specialist work around clinical activity . In case , may enough time provide sufficient Child Life guidance ; example , patient 'fast tracked ' OR run ahead schedule family arrive late . If participant group 2 , require Child Life specialist able spend minimum 15 minute child family . If possible , family exclude participation study data analysis . Similarly , case delay &gt; 1 hour postpone another day , family exclude participation study data analysis . In OR : All subject enter OR one caregiver , accord BCCH standard policy . Distraction consist usual technique employ attend anesthesiologist OR staff . These technique standardize alter purpose study may include measure bubble , storytelling , video , music . The RA present OR score subject 's state anxiety ( m-YPAS-SF ) anxiety behaviour subject/parent ( PACBIS ) time ( t1 ) IV insertion attempt IV insertion . Planned mask induction anesthesia exclude , case , anesthesiologist may elect proceed mask induction attempt IV insertion . The m-YPAS-SF PACBIS scoring still possible initial attempt IV insertion .</detailed_description>
