Non-Gaussian-distributed variable logarithmically transform prior analysis . In general , change baseline every 3 month assessment compare individually well change baseline post treatment . In addition , regression model repeat measure use describe pattern change outcome time . Additional model construct adjust potential confounding variable include age , chemotherapy type , dose duration treatment , radiation treatment , gonadotropin release hormone agonist use , hormone use . Finally , regression model use evaluate association change urinary isoprostane level study change endocrine measure .</detailed_description>
