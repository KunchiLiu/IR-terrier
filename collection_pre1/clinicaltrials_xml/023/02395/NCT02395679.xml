	<brief_title>Dendritic Cells Loaded With Allogeneous Cell Lysate Mesothelioma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To investigate safety allogeneic tumor cell lysate ( PheraLys ) load onto autologous dendritic cell ( MesoCancerVac ) patient malignant mesothelioma ( MM ) . Study design : A phase I study classical 3*3 design . Study population : Adult patient malignant mesothelioma treat chemotherapy standard treatment . Intervention : After chemotherapy , leukapheresis perform monocyte use differentiation DCs use specific cytokine . Pulsed autologous DCs ( MesoCancerVac ) re-injected 3 time every two week . After third injection MesoCancerVac , revaccinations boost immune system give 3 6 month . Main study parameters/endpoints : The aim phase I protocol study toxicity safety MesoCancerVac ( DC-based immunotherapy ) MM patient . Toxicities score accord common toxicity criterion version 4.0 . The following toxicity occur 8 week first vaccination , consider dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Patients undergo extra outdoor visit study ( 10-20 ) extra invasive procedure especially trial , like catheter blood vessel . These invasive procedure risk limit . This iv entrance necessary every time , leukopheresis , blood sample injection dendritic cell . A leucopheresis standard procedure perform accord guideline . There limited risk transient thrombocytopenia leukopenia . The administration autologous cell , load allogeneic human material , potential risk subject study . Because lysate administer patient process dendritic cell patient investigator expect risk limited .</detailed_description>

Written inform consent accord good clinical practice Planned start date vaccination 5 week last dosage chemotherapy Exclusion criteria A potential subject meet follow criterion exclude participation study : Medical psychological impediment probable compliance protocol . Current use steroid ( immunosuppressive agent ) . Patients must 6 week discontinuation must stop treatment time study . Prophylactic usage dexamethasone chemotherapy exclude 6 week interval Prior malignancy except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , superficial insitu cancer bladder cancer patient diseasefree five year . Serious concomitant disease , active infection . History autoimmune disease organ allograft , active acute chronic infection , include HIV viral hepatitis . Serious intercurrent chronic acute illness pulmonary ( asthma COPD ) cardiac ( NYHA class III IV ) hepatic disease illness consider study coordinator constitute unwarranted high risk investigational DC treatment . Known allergy shell fish ( may contain KLH ) . Pregnant lactating woman . Inadequate peripheral vein access perform leukapheresis Concomitant participation another clinical trial An organic brain syndrome significant psychiatric abnormality would comprise ability give inform consent , preclude participation full protocol followup . Absence assurance compliance protocol . Lack availability followup assessment .</criteria>
