	<brief_summary>The main objective provide original research result may change clinical practice relate metastatic colorectal cancer . The study evaluate treatment patient care different stage disease trajectory use health care large group patient . It possible compare effectiveness chemotherapy , radiotherapy symptomatic treatment give `` real life '' patient efficacy report randomised clinical trial . By use longitudinal information imaging , biomarkers , clinical stag place care possible improve patient classification various stage disease . Based , appropriate , individualized treatment colorectal cancer may recommend phase disease trajectory . Participation project influence treatment colorectal cancer . All patient treat followed-up accord current regional national guideline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Longitudinal Study Colorectal Cancer Patients With Metastatic Disease Middle-Norway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The available evidence-based knowledge patient management translate regularly updated clinical guideline diagnosis , stag treatment . The guideline represent basis oncology care Norway , health care provider expect follow guideline . Current guideline derive study patient highly select representative whole cohort patient metastatic disease . One speculate result trial conduct regional center generalize whole population region . In respect valuable study advance colorectal cancer whole population Middle-Norway , one regional center hospital area . More knowledge need optimal selection treatment individual patient . In relation symptom relief , physical psychological functioning overall quality life , clearly lack high quality research . A longitudinal follow-up large number metastatic colorectal cancer patient regular assessment previously launch . The exist infrastructure Norway make study feasible provide high internal external validity relate clinical outcome . The study constitute unique platform comprehensive research aim patient group . It also provide concept transfer major disease , extend health region Norway .</detailed_description>
