	<brief_title>Evaluate Safety Feasibility Injecting PMD-MSC Into Penis Treat Symptoms PD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Symptoms Peyronie 's disease include penile pain curvature penis prevents penetration and/or cause erectile dysfunction ( ED ) . It characterize plaque form along top bottom side penis inside tunica albuginea ; plaque begin localize inflammation develops harden scar . Cases range mild severe . In several case , harden plaque reduces flexibility , cause penis curve erection . The sexual problem result low man 's self-esteem interfere couple 's physical emotional relationship . The cause unknown ; however , possibility include trauma , inherited condition , Vitamin E deficiency , diabetes , vascular disease . Conservative treatment use acute phase ( initial onset symptom ) include oral therapy . Vitamin E antioxidant decrease build-up harmful chemical cause injury tissue . It often use traditional treatment ; inexpensive proper dose , minimal side effect . Other oral agent include Potaba ( aminobenzoates potassium ) ; however , expensive ( $ 1000 per year ) associate gastrointestinal side effect . Other therapy involve injection directly plaque ( intralesional ) chemical collagenase calcium-channel blocker . Surgical therapy offer disease stable ( symptoms present one year ) . Invasive surgical option consist correction penile curvature placement penile prosthesis straighten penis allow erection . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) use variety medical treatment repair regenerate acute chronically damage tissue . These cell potential repair human tissue form cell mesenchymal origin , cartilage , bone , fat , muscle , blood vessel . Most research focus bone marrow derive stem cell ( BMC ) however process harvest cell invasive , painful , yield low cell count . The human placenta offer alternative source form MSCs . Placental Matrix-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( PMD-MSCs ) compromise novel cellular repair matrix derive placental mesenchyme . Mesenchyme meshwork embryonic connective tissue mesoderm , form muscular connective tissue body also blood vessel . PMD-MSCs provide extracellular matrix viable mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) coordinate tissue repair process , regenerative growth factor , anti-inflammatory cytokine require regenerate damage vasculature penile corpus . The research propose establish safety feasibility utilize intracavernosal , intralesional injection PMD-MSCs treat Peyronie 's disease intent avoid surgery .</detailed_description>
