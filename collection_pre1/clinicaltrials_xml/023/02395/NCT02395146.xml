	<brief_summary>Thyroid surgeon place enormous amount importance rightly preservation recurrent laryngeal nerve ( RLN ) thyroidectomy . A good knowledge anatomy nerve meticulous dissection technique intraoperative identification nerve crucial anatomic functional integrity nerve . The use intraoperative neural monitoring aid surgeon identification RLN gain acceptance consider standard practice several unit . However , less emphasis place historically identification preservation external branch superior laryngeal nerve ( EBSLN ) thyroid surgery . The EBSLN supply cricothyroid muscle control pitch variation phonation . Unlike damage recurrent laryngeal nerve manifest readily vocal cord paralysis , intraoperative damage EBSLN difficult ass postoperatively visual assessment larynx indicative integrity nerve . Injury EBSLN cause weakness complete paralysis ipsilateral cricothyroid muscle . Patients may report deep voice inability produce high pitch sound . Patients may also complain weakness , tightness voice , require extra effort speak . Of note , voice change EBSLN injury subtle general population devastate patient depend voice living . Importantly , EBSLN injury report upto 50 % thyroid surgery contrast 12 % recurrent laryngeal nerve injury thyroid surgery . The new guideline publish Laryngoscope recommend routine intraoperative neural monitoring EBSLN . The Investigators functional system use currently monitor recurrent laryngeal nerve intraoperatively propose study impact monitor EBSLN use neural monitoring device improve voice result follow thyroid surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Thyroid surgery result change voice . This two nerve control voice quality situate close anatomically thyroid gland risk damage surgery . One nerve call recurrent laryngeal nerve control movement voice cord readily identifiable injury also detect easily direct examination voice box reduced/absent movement voice cord . It get damage upto 1 % thyroid surgery . The nerve interest study call superior laryngeal nerve , external branch ( EBSLN ) control pitch voice cord supply muscle call cricothyroid . This nerve difficult see report damage 50 % thyroid surgery . Its damage pick direct examination larynx voice change subtle though devastating individual depend voice livelihood singer actor etc . The Investigators would like study use nerve monitor use check RLN thyroid surgery also use check EBSLN . The Investigators hope could reduce chance damage nerve significantly . If study show good preservation EBSLN nerve monitor Investigators able make standard procedure thyroid surgery . The Investigators plan recruit patient undergo thyroid surgery involve one half thyroid gland . They give information study consent obtain . If agree participate divide two group randomly intraoperative EBSLN monitoring . All patient preoperative voice assessment speech therapy unit involve fill voice questionnaire undergo glottography ( pitch assessment ) They undergo surgery Approximately 3 month surgery another voice assessment use voice questionnaire glottography . At time also EMG assessment cricothyroid muscle best method check function EBSLN . No procedures/assessments undertaken .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients undergo diagnostic hemithyroidectomies ( thyroid nodule 5 cm less ) . age 18 able provide inform consent Patients develop recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy follow surgery exclude study . Patients withdraw consent study Patients preexist laryngeal pathology like reinkes edema , vocal cord nodule , laryngeal inflammation , previous laryngeal surgery etc Pregnant woman ( confirmed history routine pregnancy test ) Those unable give inform consent Previous major neck surgery neck dissection , laryngeal surgery , carotid endarterectomy , parathyroid thyroid surgery .</criteria>
