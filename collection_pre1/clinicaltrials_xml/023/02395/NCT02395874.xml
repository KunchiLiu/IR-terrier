	<brief_summary>To study effect combine tDCS plus speech therapy compare sham-tDCS plus speech therapy subacute stroke patient suffer moderate severe aphasia .

	<brief_title>tDCS Speech Therapy Improve Aphasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 25 % patient stroke suffer aphasia . The aphasia could severe , patient produce word , communication ability rather poor . In case speech therapy common therapy , functional outcome patient often sufficiently . The transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) might improve outcome speech therapy patient severe aphasia . The patient randomize either verum stimulation ( group A ) sham stimulation ( group B ) . In group A receive every workday 6 week 20min tDCS 2 mA combination 30 min speech therapy . In group B receive every workday 6 week 20min tDCS 0 mA combination 30 min speech therapy . The anodal electrode place case total anterior circulation stroke homologous speech area right hemisphere case partial anterior circulation stroke perilesional left hemisphere . The cathode position contralateral .</detailed_description>
