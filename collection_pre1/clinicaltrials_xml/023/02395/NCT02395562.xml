	<brief_title>Viral Reactivation Skin Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Squamous Cell Carcinoma skin ( SCC ) affect people high number worldwide . While yearly increase 2 million patient , develop cancer , record , organ transplant recipient ( OTR ) 60- 100-fold high risk develop skin cancer . In OTRs , skin cancer frequent tumor appear , whereas 95 % nonmelanoma skin cancer cell : squamous cell basal cell carcinoma . All OTRs need treat lifelong immunosuppressant order prevent rejection transplant organ . However , immunosuppressive treatment lead decrease immunity , therefore , cancer cell able proliferate easier . Several study show incidence skin cancer parallel length depth immunosuppression . The appearance CD4 OTRs cutaneous carcinoma significantly low compare without skin lesion . Various finding show positive correlation period exposure immunosuppressant risk skin cancer . However , little know dose type drug responsible skin cancer . The uptake three immunosuppressive medicament compare uptake two result 3-fold increased risk develop cancer . The consequence immunosuppressive therapy reversible ; patient stop immunosuppressive treatment often show decrease skin cancer . The high risk organ rejection first three month transplantation . Therefore , increase dose immunosuppressor use time . In addition cancer , high increase viral infection reactivations see OTRs . Over 90 % population carry herpesviruses . The risk viral infection reactivation much high OTRs . While induce decrease immunosurveillance , herpesvirus spread easier . Herpesvirus infection due eight human herpes virus ( HHV ) frequent immunosuppression OTRs . Once patient infect one human herpesvirus type ( Herpes simplex viruses 1 2 , varicella-zoster virus , Epstein-Barr virus , human cytomegalovirus , human herpesvirus 6 7 , Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ) , virus able establish latent , non-productive infection maintain capacity life-long reactivation . Due decrease immunity , OTRs highly susceptible activate latent herpesviral infection , critical aspect immunosuppressive treatment . The risk reactivation Cytomegalovirus Epstein-Barr virus OTRs much high compare general population . Taking discussed finding together , investigator hypothesize viral infection reactivations correlate positively skin cancer OTRs . Furthermore , investigator think viral reactivation infection use marker later incidence skin cancer . While virus infection reactivations appear early , OTRs become affected SCC early late period transplantation . The investigator thus aim analyze exist data STCS nest study test hypothesis : To assess correlation viral replication skin cancer organ transplant recipient assess viral replication predictor skin cancer . The investigator interested data available study STCS divide organ transplant recipient e.g . CMV four group : replication , large group show asymptomatic viral replication , viral syndrome one proven disease .</detailed_description>
