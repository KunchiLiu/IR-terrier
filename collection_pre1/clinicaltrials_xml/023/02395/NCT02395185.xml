	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Three Non-pharmacologic Analgesic Techniques Casting Clubfoot Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clubfoot deformity newborn common , occur 1-2/1000 birth . Treatment deformity shift surgical non-surgical management . The non-surgical management include utilizing Ponseti technique manipulation casting , follow Achilles tenotomy brace application . The newborn undergoes , average , 4-6 cast foot deformity correct . During manipulation casting , infants become fussy irritable . This irritability likely due discomfort felt manipulative process subsequent casting . Studies focus decrease pain response heel stick laboratory test neonatal intensive care unit use sucrose milk ingestion swaddle newborn decrease pain response . Both sucrose milk show decrease pain response measure Premature Infant Pain Profile ( PIPP ) Bernese Pain Scale Neonates . In addition , pain scale use newborn baby include CRIES , CHIPPS , NIPS , COMFORT scale evaluate effectiveness pain relieve intervention . These scale use alongside objective physiologic measurement heart rate , heart rate variability ( HRV ) , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation . While show sucrose milk ingestion decrease pain response heel stick , study point determine best intervention decrease pain response cast clubfoot deformity . The goal study investigate effect three different non-pharmacologic intervention ( sucrose , milk , water ) pain response clubfoot casting , allow u discern best non-pharmacologic intervention pain control clubfoot cast provide pleasant , comfortable experience patient family . A secondary objective investigate whether family environment level anxiety felt parent impact pain felt infant cast process .</detailed_description>
