	<detailed_description>Bronchoscopy-guided tissue sample central technique many disease include diagnose stag lung cancer , diagnose interstitial lung disease , acute and/or chronic rejection follow lung transplantation . Confocal fluorescence microscopy novel technique use vivo microscopic image proximal distal airway include bronchial alveolar wall , microvessels , inflammatory cell . We hypothesize confocal fluorescence microscopy image bronchiolar alveolar structure standard bronchoscopy could help recognize classify presence absence acute chronic rejection lung transplant recipient . The objective outcome study : 1 . To assess safety confocal microscopy image pediatric patient 2 . To create diagnostic criterion fibered confocal fluorescence microscopy image interpretation acute chronic rejection follow lung transplantation 3 . To determine sensitivity specificity confocal imaging patient group compare transbronchial biopsy 4 . Correlate confocal image FEV1 result 5 . Correlate CXRs and/or CT image</detailed_description>
