	<brief_title>Comparing Diagnostic Yield Between R-EBUS Guided Cryo Biopsy Vs. CT Guided Biopsy PPL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obtaining tissue sample diagnose PPL suspect cancerous origin utmost importance . Sampling PPL do either chest wall ( transthoracic ) airways lead PPL ( endobronchial ) . The current gold slander Transthoracic Needle Aspiration ( TTNA ) approach do use CT guide biopsy success rate &gt; 90 % . However , success diagnostic yield come expense increased side effect profile include high risk pneumothorax ( 30 % ) . Half patient require chest drain insertion . Given lung cancer originate bronchus , hence name `` bronchogenic carcinoma '' , would rational think endobronchial route provide best way sample least amount side effect . However , yield still satisfactory wide confidence interval . When diagnose PPL endobronchially , accurate visualisation lesion main issue . To overcome issue various navigation method use accurately locate PPL improve diagnostic yield . The use Radial Endo Bronchial USS ( R-EBUS ) one navigational modality . The conventional R-EBUS guide biopsy carry use cytology brush forceps biopsy . These method extremely safe &lt; 1 % pneumothorax rate however , diagnostic yield meta-analysis 14 study 73 % . Use new biopsy method call cryo-biopsy may bridge gap increase diagnostic yield PPL . Cryotherapy use compress gas release high flow rapidly expand creates low temperature -89C . These low temperature cause tissue get stuck end cryo-probe . Due rapid cool microvasculature around biopsy site go vasospasm reduces bleed despite large biopsy sample acquire . Cryotherapy use airway since 1968 . The ability use method patient use high flow oxygen well cheap equipment use make affordable useful equipment interventional bronchoscopy unit . Most bronchoscopists train familiar cryo biopsy technique . The cryo-biopsies compare forceps biopsy study demonstrate large sample size less crush artefact favour cryo- biopsy use . The encouraging result publish recently look cryo-biopsy PPL use R-EBUS guidance , demonstrate yield 74 % ability obtain 3 time large tissue biopsy compare traditional forceps biopsy . There pneumothorax cohort minor bleeding record require bronchoscopy suction alone intervention record . However , head head trial compare Cryo-probe vs. gold standard : CT-guided biopsy . As cryo-biopsy favourable side effect profile without pneumothorax occurrence yield non-inferior would certainly prefer choice biopsy PPL future . With regard cost analysis show R-EBUS guide biopsy Vs. CT guide biopsy similar cost profile procedure alone . However final cost procedure depend side effect experience use procedure , make CT guide biopsy costlier 2 method . However , cryo-biopsy CT guide biopsy compare economic analysis . Methodology All patient PPL require diagnosis eligible trial . Prior procedure : ( Either CT guide biopsy cryo biopsy ) 1 . The size lesion record ( volume assessment maximum diameter axial scan ) CT scan prior procedure . . If patient randomise cryo biopsy arm : 1 . The bronchoscopist plan pathway PPL base CT scan . The sub segment lesion could biopsied pre-determined document . If available , virtual bronchoscopy use confirm navigational path lesion . 2 . Maximum time allow locate lesion via R-EBUS would 20 min . 3 . The procedure do usual guideline practice centre flexible bronchoscopy procedure . As multi-centre trial centre variation usual practice bronchoscopy may vary . 4 . Some centre may use fluoroscopy , addition , localise lesion . This also acceptable protocol . 5 . If endobronchial lesion find patient exclude . 6 . Once flexible bronchoscopy introduce pre-determined desired segment , R-EBUS insert covered GS . 7 . Once R EBUS locate lesion , GS leave situ USS probe retract . 8 . The cryo probe insert GS desire location . Flexible Cryo probe ( out diameter 1.9 mm ) apply 4 second biopsy . 9 . The probe retract together GS bronchoscope en masse biopsy . 10 . A minimum 1 maximum 3 sample take . 11 . A CXR take within 1-hour post procedure access pneumothorax . 12 . Adverse event procedure record : Minor bleeding ( require cold saline adrenalin ) , moderate bleeding ( require bronchial blocker APC ) large bleed ( require blood transfusion , FFP , cardiothoracic support ) etc . 13 . If chest tube placement , investigation due side effect overnight hospital stay require cost calculate retrospectively . Minor bleeding consider additional cost occurs routine bronchoscopy . If patient randomise CT biopsy arm : 1 . The interventional radiologist decide best position patient stay procedure . 2 . A core biopsy perform per usual practice centre . In CMDHB CT guide biopsy perform core biopsy . 3 . The patient 2-6 biopsy PPL . 4 . Patient lie side biopsy 1 hour post procedure . Post procedure monitoring perform per usual practice . 5 . A CXR 1 hour post procedure perform assess pneumothorax procedure relate bleeding . 6 . If chest tube placement , investigation due side effect overnight hospital stay require cost calculate retrospectively . At pathology : All sample assess area specimen assess size . The ability perform molecular typing document . An independent pathologist ass sample Economic analysis : For procedure : Both direct cost ( From hospital record ) indirect cost ( administer patient questionnaire ) record . The main aim cost analysis calculate cost side effect management arm determine cost effective method sample PPL .</detailed_description>
