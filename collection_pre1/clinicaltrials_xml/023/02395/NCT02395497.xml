	<brief_summary>Injuries external genitalia great concern military emphasis place surgical reconstruction psychological health Wounded Warriors . However , despite significant surgical advance microvascular surgery autologous free tissue transfer , conventional reconstruction truly replace complicated structure function penis include urethra , erogenous sensation , erectile corporal body . Conventional reconstruction pose several challenge : patient may sufficient donor tissue ( i.e. , forearm thigh ) due injury previous surgery ; multiple operation often need restore neophallus ; final reconstruction approximate penis ' native form ; recreate urethra challenge new urethra prone stricture fistula formation ; erectile function necessary sexual intercourse often lack ; insufficient protective sensation lead penile implant extrusion , infection , subsequent explantation loss reconstruction . For reason , investigator propose current clinical trial determine functional outcome quality life ( QOL ) Wounded Warriors civilian choose undergo penile allotransplantation . The investigator combine extensive experience perform total penile reconstruction large population affect congenital , traumatic , therapeutically extirpate GU deformity expertise reconstructive transplantation use immunomodulatory protocol implement study . The investigator anticipate penile transplantation potentially replace `` like like , '' restore appearance , anatomy , function recipient manner far superior autologous reconstruction . This project establish ability perform penile allotransplantation use immunomodulatory protocol compare outcomes conventional phalloplasty patient result . Study Design : This non-randomized subject self-controlled clinical trial implement cell-based immunomodulatory protocol penile allotransplantation . An intermediate deliverable achieve allograft survival functional return reduce dosing/frequency maintenance immunosuppression steroid-free monotherapy ( tacrolimus ) immunosuppression . The long-term deliverable goal demonstrate equivalent superior outcome compare satisfaction QOL conventional phalloplasty patient 12-60 month post-transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : 1 ) To assess feasibility function penile allotransplantation Wounded Warriors civilian lose penis due battle traumatic injury , use immunomodulatory protocol reduce immunosuppression ; 2 ) To assess pre-to-post change QOL patient undergo penile allotransplantation .</detailed_description>
