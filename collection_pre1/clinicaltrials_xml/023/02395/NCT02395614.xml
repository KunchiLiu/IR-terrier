	<brief_title>Surgical Site Infection With 0.05 % Chlorhexidine ( CHG ) Compared Triple Antibiotic Irrigation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast reconstruction tissue expender ( TE ) remain gold standard breast restoration mastectomy . During first stage reconstruction , TE place chest muscle slowly inflate postoperatively period several week . After desired volume TE achieve exchanged permanent breast prosthesis another surgery ( second stage reconstruction ) . Postoperative wound infection placement TE lead devastate consequence patient surgeon . Frequently , surgical site infection require additional surgery result removal TE long term IV antibiotic therapy . Therefore , breast reconstruction procedure possible measure implement reduce postoperative infection rate . Several study demonstrate intra-operative irrigation surgical wound antibiotic contain solution insertion breast TE decrease postoperative infection rate . This approach currently adopt standard care within plastic surgery clinical community . The investigator intend perform prospective randomize study compare incidence surgical wound infection mastectomy wound irrigated triple antibiotic solution ( one side ) 0.05 % CHG ( opposite side ) patient undergo bilateral breast reconstruction .</detailed_description>
