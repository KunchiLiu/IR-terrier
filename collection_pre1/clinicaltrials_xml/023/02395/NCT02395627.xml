	<brief_summary>The investigator propose randomize two arm trial , use Simon 's 2-stage design , ER+ patient therapy resistant breast cancer test optimal sequence dose epigenetic immune prim hormone therapy resistance breast cancer . A third arm ( Arm C ) include ER-negative patient follow concurrent priming , exclude tamoxifen . The two arm include vorinostat , TAM pembrolizumab evaluate - Sequential prim - begin pembrolizumab Cycle 1 ( Arm B Arm C ) , - Concurrent prim maximal dose epigenetic immune modulators- begin pembrolizumab day 1 Cycle 2 ( Arm A )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reversing Therapy Resistance With Epigenetic-Immune Modification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unique aspect study : This first study look response hormone therapy resistance breast cancer epigenetic immune priming . It also first study look combination HDAC inhibitor ( vorinostat ) , anti-estrogen ( tamoxifen ) PD-1 inhibitor , pembrolizumab pre postmenopausal patient ER+ advance breast cancer progression multiple prior therapy . Recent preclinical study suggest epigenetic priming may even effective ER-negative tumor respond immune check point inhibitor low PD-1/PD-L1 expression . The goal study demonstrate Vorinostat increase PD-1 PD-L1 expression . In third arm study evaluate role epigenetic priming tumor ER-negative .</detailed_description>
