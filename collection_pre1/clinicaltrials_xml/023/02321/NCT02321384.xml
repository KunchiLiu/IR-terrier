	<brief_summary>This study single-center , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , single-ascending dose ( SAD ) multiple-ascending dose ( MAD ) study evaluate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics ( PK ) RO6889678 combination RO6889678 Ritonavir ( RTV ) follow oral administration healthy volunteer . The effect food PK RO6889678 effect multiple dose RO6889678 combination RO6889678 RTV PK single oral microdose midazolam evaluate . Healthy participant screen 28 day randomization sequentially enrol SAD MAD unboosted RTV-boosted cohort , randomly assign RO6889678 match placebo . In RTV-boosted cohort participant take RO6889678 combination RTV . To explore effect food RO6889678 PK , cohort volunteer participate two-period food effect sub-study . Participants enrol MAD cohort give oral microdose midazolam repeat treatment RO6889678 evaluate drug-drug interaction potential RO6889678 .</brief_summary>
