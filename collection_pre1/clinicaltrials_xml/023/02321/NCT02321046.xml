No additional procedure besides already use routine clinical practice apply patient . Treatment assignment do accord current practice . It plan enrol approximately 300 subject Russian Federation . Approximately 60 EGFR m+ ( mutation-positive ) patient follow 1.5 year . EGFR mutation rate treatment cytology plasma sample treatment-naive patient advance NSCLC Russia consider primary outcome variable study .</detailed_description>
