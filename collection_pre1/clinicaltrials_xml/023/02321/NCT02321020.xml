	<brief_title>Follow Radiofrequency Maze Mitral Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation present different frequency patient affected structural heart diseases require surgery , show peak incidence 60-80 % mitral subject . It cause increase risk systemic embolism , cardiac failure development high limitation due dyspnoea fatigue exercise . Cox-Maze technique surgical atrial fibrillation treatment first use 1987 suffer lot modification since . Nowadays , center replace `` cut sew '' technique method use several power source achieve target much easy way . One alternative energy source currently use radiofrequency ablation demonstrate simple , safe reproducible procedure acceptable success rate term sinus rhythm restoration . However , organize atrial activity ( sinus rhythm surface electrocardiogram ) always accompany effective mechanical atrial contraction , whose restoration represent one original Maze objective . Atrial contraction effective A wave find tricuspid and/or mitral transvalvular flow use Doppler echocardiography , allow patient fully profit hemodynamic clinical advantage organize atrial contraction . Predictive factor atrial contractility recovery , widely , sinus rhythm achievement modify Maze procedure investigate , , knowledge , parallel deep analysis comparison possible determinant surgical ablation goal still lack . In present study , investigator describe mid-term result concomitant modified radiofrequency Maze large homogeneous population mitral patient , focus onto common predictor sinus rhythm atrial contractility restoring , time course appearance interrelation .</detailed_description>
