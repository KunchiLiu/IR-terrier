	<brief_summary>In study , investigator would like compare heparin-coated tubing system minimize extracorporeal circulation ( MECC ) conventional tube system MECC , contain heparin coating . The MECC system use since 14 year investigator ' hospital extracorporeal system support circulation provide oxygen tissue coronary artery bypass grafting . Until today , investigator perform 5000 MECC procedure department .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rheoparin-coated Tubing System Minimized Extracorporeal Circulation ( MECC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The investigator would like investigate new composition MECC system patient receive coronary artery bypass surgery . Normally , MECC system induces complement system activation coagulation cascade , could negative impact postoperative outcome . A tubing system contain heparin ( rheoparin ) could contribute good biocompatibility term diminish activation inflammatory reaction reduction cerebral embolic load , regular issue extracorporeal circulation due formation solid gaseous microemboli tube system . Objective The aim investigate biocompatibility ( coagulation , inflammation ) influence cerebral embolic load rheoparin-coated MECC system compare result current MECC system contain rheoparin-free tubing system . Methods Patients undergo elective coronary artery surgery randomize receive extracorporeal circulation use MECC system without rheoparin coating . All procedure perform accord institutional standard .</detailed_description>
