	<brief_summary>The goal Part 1 clinical research study find high dose ( Imbruvica ) ibrutinib give patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The goal Part 2 clinical research study learn dose ibrutinib find Part 1 help control disease . The safety drug also study part study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Ibrutinib Previously Treated Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 4 group 6 participant enrol Part 1 study , to19 participant enrol Part 2 . If enrol Part 1 , dose ibrutinib receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level ibrutinib . Each new group receive high dose ibrutinib group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose ibrutinib find . If enrol Part 2 , receive ibrutinib high dose tolerate Part 1 . Study Drug Administration : You take ibrutinib pill 1 time day , time every day . You may take dose ibrutinib without food . Study Visits : Each cycle 4 week . On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - On Cycle 2 , blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test dose 4 time next 6 hour dose . PK test measure amount study drug body different timepoints . - If doctor think need , blood ( ½ teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . Every 8 week , CT , MRI , x-ray check status disease . You type scan perform screening . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Dosing Visit : About 30 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , blood ( ½ teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . Follow Up Visits : Every 6 month ask come clinic call member study staff ask start new anti-cancer treatment . If call , take 10 minute . This investigational study . Ibrutinib FDA approve commercially available treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) . It consider investigational use drug treat NSCLC . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 43 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
