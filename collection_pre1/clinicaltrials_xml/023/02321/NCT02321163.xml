	<detailed_description>Introduction : Skeletal muscle responds stimulus mechanical load growth maintenance . Prolonged reduction muscle activity mechanical loading spaceflight , limb immobilization , bedrest , and/or inactivity alter balance protein synthesis degradation , result skeletal muscle atrophy ( 1-3 ) . This characterized decrease muscle mass , myofiber cross-sectional area , contractile strength speed , well slow-to-fast fiber type transformation ( 4,5 ) . Many countermeasure report attenuate loss muscle atrophy neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) frequently use condition spinal cord injury , immobilization , muscle disuse post-surgery ( 6,7 ) . Indeed , recent Cochrane review effectiveness NMES muscle weakness adult progressive disease COPD , chronic heart failure cancer indicate NMES effective mean improve muscle weakness ( 8 ) . The meta-analyses include eleven randomize control trial ( RCT ) study involve total 218 participant . NMES significantly improve quadriceps strength Standardised Mean Difference ( SMD ) 0.9 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.33 1.46 ) . This approximately equal 25 Newton metre ( Nm ) regard clinically significant . Similarly , another recent systematic review also show NMES effective prevent skeletal-muscle weakness critically ill patient . Eight eligible study involve 172 patient include analysis . Out eight study , five study report increase strength good preservation strength NMES , one study large effect size ( 1.44 ) . Two study find good preservation muscle mass NMES , small moderate effect size ( 0.11-0.39 ) significant benefit find two study ( 9 ) . The effectiveness NMES dependent upon clinical condition influence different stimulation parameter , particularly stimulation frequency duration . Traditionally , NMES view application transcutaneous electrical current neuromuscular junction , aim depolarise motor unit action potential inducing muscle contraction ( 10 ) . This electrically induced muscle contraction simulate active muscle strengthen base principle muscle train appropriate loading , muscle strength increase . To achieve training effect , stimulation parameter employ normally aim produce tetanic contraction current density subject maximally tolerate ( 8,9 ) . However , currently adopt stimulation protocol ( ie . high frequency 50Hz , amplitude subject ' maximum tolerate limit short duration ( 30 min 1 hr ) counteract muscle atrophy two main drawback . First , well establish mechanical unloading associate detrimental change structure function skeletal muscle , characterize reduction muscle mass , myofiber cross-sectional area , contractile strength speed , well slow-to-fast fiber type transformation ( review , see 11 ) . Thus , slow twitch muscle fiber susceptible unloading disuse effect rather fast twitch muscle fiber . The traditional high frequency stimulation protocol ( 50 Hz ) match motor unit fire pattern slow-twitch muscle . Moreover , high current density would inevitably cause discomfort pain subject electrical stimulation . The subject tolerate electrical stimulation hour . This particularly case application subject disuse muscle atrophy subject muscle weakness cause progressive disease . Very often , pain tolerance group subject generally low normal healthy subject . Thus , currently adopt protocol might necessary render best possible outcome NMES enhancement muscle function . The beneficial effect NMES counteract muscle atrophy fully utilized . A recent systematic review examines metabolic structural change low limb skeletal muscle follow neuromuscular electrical stimulation identify 18 study . Eight study investigate enzymatic activity , seven study muscle fibre composition , 14 muscle fibre size . Among 18 study , 9 RCT study , methodological quality generally poor . The author conclude NMES seem able produce favourable change oxidative enzyme activity , skeletal muscle fibre type skeletal muscle fibre size . In view large heterogeneity NMES protocol , author conclude definite consensus regard stimulation frequency optimal muscular change ( 12 ) , For instance , Theriault et al . ( 13 ) conduct prolonged electrical stimulation knee extensor 8 healthy adult . The electrical stimulation protocol 8-week duration 8 hour per day 6 day per week . The stimulation parameter low frequency ( 8 Hz ) intensity able produce visible vibration . The result suggest significant improvement knee extensor performance 4 week stimulation . However , study RCT study control group study . On hand , one RCT study investigate effect NMES incorporate high frequency ( 50Hz ) low amplitude ( without muscle contraction ) placebo group incidentally reveal placebo produce well effect intervention group . The NMES group v placebo group SMD -0.12 ( 95 % CI : -0.63 , 0.39 ) ( 8,14 ) . Banerjee group also show electrical stimulation protocol low frequency ( 4 Hz ) yet high amplitude ( 300mA ) , 1 hr/day 6 week significantly increase quadriceps strength healthy sedentary adult patient stable chronic heart failure ( 15 , 16 ) . Thus , finding basic science clinical study suggest need exploration effective NMES stimulation protocol attenuate muscle atrophy . Aims Hypotheses Tested : To address , investigator proposal challenge traditional thought NMES high frequency high amplitude . The investigator test hypothesis low frequency low amplitude effective attenuate muscle atrophy , investigate cellular mechanism associate muscle unload . Using hindlimb suspension animal model , investigator previously demonstrate , hindlimb suspension , application low-frequency electrical stimulation 20 Hz soleus muscle define time pulse parameter partially rescue loss satellite cell improve fiber cross-sectional area ( 17 ) . The investigator demonstrate use electrical stimulation paradigm frequency : 20 Hz ; duration : 3 h , twice daily eight-week-old male BALB/c mice subject 14-day hindlimb unloading ( HU ) . This stimulation paradigm enhance satellite cell proliferative potential well suppress apoptotic cell death disuse induce muscle atrophy . Morphologically , hindlimb electrical stimulation show significant improvement muscle mass , cross-sectional area , peak tetanic force relative HU limb ( 18 ) . Recently , investigator investigate optimum stimulation protocol demonstrate among three low frequency protocol , 2 , 10 20 Hz , stimulation 2 Hz 2 × 3 h/day achieve best effect attenuate loss muscle fiber cross-sectional area force . This stimulation parameter lead 1.2-fold increase satellite cell proliferation , effective rescue cell apoptosis ( 19 ) . With encouraging finding basic science research , investigator believe propose new paradigm NMES test subject progressive muscle atrophy . The investigator hypothesis NMES 2 Hz 2 × 3 h/day effective attenuating/improving low limb postural muscle atrophy , namely quadriceps gastrocnemius soleus muscle complex . Plan Investigation : Based finding exist literature current adopt NMES stimulation protocol attenuate muscle atrophy improve muscle performance various population , investigator hypothesize propose new paradigm NMES would effective improve muscle cross-sectional area ( CSA ) , strength , endurance , exercise tolerance , acceptable subject need NMES attenuate muscle atrophy various medical condition , particular chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient .</detailed_description>
