	<brief_title>The Efficacy Denosumab Active Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.0 Hypothesis Moderate severely active Crohn 's disease ( CD ) respond treatment Denosumab , ( monoclonal antibody Receptor Activator Nuclear factor-Kappa B ligand ( RANKL ) The principal research question address : 1 . Determine single dose Denosumab induce clinical response 12 week person active CD 2 . Determine single dose Denosumab induce clinical remission 12 week person active CD 3 . Determine single dose Denosumab reduce marker systemic ( C-reactive protein , CRP ) intestinal ( fecal calprotectin , FCAL ) inflammation person active CD . 2 . Background Current treatment paradigm CD involve step-up approach , person mild disease treat 5-aminosalicylate ( 5-ASA ) , budesonide even therapy . Persons fail respond relatively inexpensive well tolerated medication , often require intensive therapy include systemic corticosteroid , immunomodulatory agent azathioprine methotrexate , biologic agent . While latter proven efficacy treatment CD , quite costly , use may result significant side effect . Currently , biologic agent infliximab adalimumab , specifically antagonize tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF ) ultimate step medical management CD . However , nearly one-third subject respond standard anti-TNF base induction regimen , response lose one-half subject respond initial induction course one year . Of start anti-TNF respond , continuous therapy recommend , cost may exceed $ 25000- $ 40000 per year . Furthermore , combination immunomodulator anti-TNF agent enhances clinical response , may increase risk infectious complication , use also associate hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma , rare almost uniformly fatal . In population base cost study Manitoba infliximab patient represent small proportion inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) patient , yet account total approximately $ 2 million drug cost 2005/06 , represent approximately half prescription drug cost IBD patient Manitoba . Hence , would desirable medication effective induce maintain remission improve side effect profile low cost provision . 2.1 What Denosumab : Denosumab , fully human monoclonal antibody RANKL approve treatment postmenopausal osteoporosis June 2010 . It administer subcutaneously every 6 month highly effective reduce risk vertebral , non-vertebral , hip fracture risk . A mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis show Denosumab effective strontium ranelate , raloxifene , alendronate , risedronate prevent new vertebral fracture . It agent work men well woman . According 2010 Osteoporosis Canada Clinical Practice Guidelines , Denosumab first-line option pharmacological management postmenopausal osteoporosis ( PMO ) . `` Owing efficacy , safety , potential improve adherence rate , Denosumab consider appropriate first-line pharmacologic option PMO management . '' The registration Denosumab culmination discovery clarification internal bone microenvironment regulation bone remodeling : osteoblast-produced competitor : RANKL osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) ; osteoclast receptor : RANK . Our understanding pathophysiology normal bone homeostasis pathogenesis osteoporosis integration immune response greatly advanced discovery RANKL-RANK ligation osteoblast osteoclast precursor . Osteoblasts express RANKL bind osteoclast precursor ( RANK ) osteoblast derive soluble decoy receptor -OPG . The bind RANK RANKL induce signal gene expression cascade result differentiation maturation osteoclasts ultimately lead osteoporosis . OPG block interaction , thereby inhibit osteoclast formation hence decrease bone resorption . It show agent enhance RANKL production associate development osteoporosis whereas agent block RANKL reduce bone mineral loss . When RANKL upregulated estrogen-deficient state exceeds amount OPG , increase osteoclastogenesis bone resorption , major mechanism bone mass loss osteoporotic fracture postmenopausal state . The human monoclonal antibody RANKL ( Denosumab ) first product develop reduce bone resorption inhibit RANKL bind RANK . Denosumab accumulate bone . Extension registration trial ( 'FREEDOM ' ) 5-year data indicates continue safety efficacy , extend 10 year generate even longer-term data . The profound reversible suppression bone turnover see Denosumab partly explain continuous increase bone mineral density see 8 year phase II clinical trial . As noted , Denosumab effective men woman potentially effective glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis . 2.2 Rationale Denosumab CD There 3 main concept underpin rationale use Denosumab treat CD . 1 . CD associate increase risk osteoporosis biology osteoporosis T cell mediate inflammation , think integral CD , involve RANKL paradigm 2 . Animal model bone loss colitis treat RANKL inhibitor improve bone mass colitis . A dinitrofluorobenzene sulfonic acid model colitis lab show significant improvement Denosumab treatment compare vehicle ( saline ) treatment . 3 . CD associated increase mutation locus encodes RANKL 2.2.1 Osteoporosis IBD : The prevalence osteoporosis define bone mineral density test patient IBD estimate 15 % . Population-based study show modest excess fracture risk IBD subject ( approximately 20-40 % great match control ) rate approximately 1 fracture per 100 patient year . Steroid use specific concern IBD patients—a recent meta-analysis find current corticosteroid use approximately double risk fracture independent risk determine age bone mineral density alone . Modulating RANKL IBD may effective manage IBD-associated osteoporosis . RANKL also regulator T cell-dendritic cell interaction immune system crucial factor early lymphocyte development lymph node organogenesis . The central importance system bone lymph node homeostasis see RANKL gene-deficient mouse unable support osteoclast differentiation , display severe osteopetrosis ( even presence bone resorb factor vitamin D3 , dexamethasone , PGE2 ) , show evidence bone remodeling , simultaneously lack lymph node . Activated T cell directly trigger osteoclastogenesis RANKL lead bone loss , effect block OPG . Hence , system may critical link systemic mucosal inflammation alter bone metabolism , ultimately , osteoporosis . Denosumab potently remove RANKL circulation . Denosumab inhibit pathway prevent RANKL bind receptor . Denosumab therefore antagonist RANKL 's action . Since pharmacologic inhibition nuclear factor kappa beta ( NF-κB ) pathway infliximab efficacious CD , reposition opportunity arises . For safety , cost compliance reason Denosumab attractive alternative anti-TNF therapy . The genetic data provide additional rationale study focus individual harbor allele increase RANKL expression , might provide cohort would achieve great gain treat RANKL inhibitor . Hence enroll patient carry G allele , since hypothesize slightly large response treatment subgroup . The risk allele also relatively common ( G-allele frequency = 0.487 haplotype map ( HapMap ) CEU ) , therefore expect approximately 75 % patient carrier . No clinical trial assess effectiveness Denosumab treatment CD undertaken . 2.3 Denosumab safety : Denosumab test phase III clinical trial 10,000 people post-marketing surveillance data since 2010 . Although nuisance side effect report denosumab ( headache , fatigue , arthralgia ) , lead clinical sequela . Hypocalcemia : Anticipated frequency ~2-15 % ( 25-27 ) . Reported event hypocalcemia mild , transient associate clinical sequela . All patient recommend take daily supplemental calcium ( ≥500mg ) vitamin D ( ≥400 IU ) per day . Serum calcium ( correct albumin ) measure 3 day post dose every 4 week . Patients experience hypocalcemia treat per discretion treat physician use standard protocol . Osteonecrosis Jaw : Anticipated frequency &lt; 1 % . The plan dose associate osteonecrosis jaw . The concomitant risk factor include cancer , recent plan invasive dental procedure current use anti-angiogenic medication . Individuals risk factor exclude trial . Even trial include high risk patient ( cancer ) , incidence rate &lt; 2 % . All participant receive write documentation advise avoid invasive dental procedure duration trial , decrease occurrence adverse event . 3 . The Proposed Trial : An open label multicentred trial . Active therapy arm : Denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously one dose .
