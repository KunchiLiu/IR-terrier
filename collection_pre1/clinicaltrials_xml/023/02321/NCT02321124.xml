While patient sit position , start lumbosacral region , low thoracic , scapular , inter-scapular cervical region include treatment , respectively . All patient also advise increase physical activity level , fluid fibre intake , take ideal posture defecation ( squat position ) two-pages document . Evaluations Physical ( age , gender , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) ( kg/m² ) demographic ( educational status , duration constipation , marital status , employment status ) data participant record . In addition , number meal per day , daily amount liquid consumption , physical activity level record . The participant ' physical activity level measure use Turkish version International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form ( IPAQ-SF ) . Measurements perform baseline immediately treatment . All patient evaluate experienced therapist , blind result pre-treatment measurement ( CG ) . The primary outcome measure *Constipation Severity Instrument ( CSI ) To evaluate severity participant ' constipation , Constipation Severity Instrument ( CSI ) use . CSI design evaluate individual ' defecation frequency consistency well level strain experienced individual bowel movement . There three subscales CSI , obstructive defecation ( OT ) , colonic inertia ( CI ) , pain . Higher score CSI indicate severe constipation . Kaya et al . show Turkish version CSI reliable valid determine constipation grade severity . Secondary outcome measure - Patient Assessment Constipation Quality Life Questionnaire ( PAC-QOL ) Patient Assessment Constipation Quality Life Questionnaire ( PAC-QOL ) include total 28 item 4 subscales : worry concern ( 11 item ) , physical discomfort ( 4 item ) , psychosocial discomfort ( 8 item ) , satisfaction ( 5 item ) . Higher score PAC-QOL indicate negative effect constipation quality life .

This diary include item regard frequency bowel movement , stool consistency , defecation time , feel incomplete evacuation , change food liquid consumption . - Perception Subjective Change Individuals ' perception subjective change treatment evaluate use 5-point Likert-type scale : 0 : No change , 1 : Minimal change , 2 : Moderate change , 3 : Important change , 4 : Very important change . - Compliance Advices Compliance participant lifestyle advice evaluate use 4-point Likert-type scale : 0 : No compliance , 1 : minimal compliance , 2 : moderate compliance , 3 : Full compliance .</detailed_description>
