	<brief_summary>The primary purpose LAA-CLOSURE trial ass efficacy safety surgical closure LAA patient undergo aortic valve replacement . This randomize , prospective , open-label international multicenter trial enroll 1040 patient undergoing aortic valve replacement CHA2DS2-VASC score ≥2 without indication anticoagulation time enrollment . Patients randomize 1:1 fashion standard therapy + surgical closure LAA vs. standard therapy alone . The duration study five year ( plus additional 10 year ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous study conclude ≥90 % AF related leave atrial thrombus locate leave atrial appendage ( LAA ) . Surgical closure LAA perform use ligation , stapler device design purpose cardiac surgery . However , current evidence surgical closure LAA scarce large scale randomize prospective clinical trial address issue publish . American College Cardiology ( ACC ) / American Heart Association ( AHA ) guideline state LAA exclusion consider patient recurrent persistent AF remain symptomatic heart rate control antiarrhythmic medication tolerate longer effective . Current European Association Cardiothoracic Surgery ( EACTS ) guideline conclude proven benefit surgical LAA exclusion term stroke reduction mortality benefit ( level evidence 2a B ) , exclusion contemplate , device design appendage exclusion use rather cut-and-sew stapling technique . These guideline base small poorly design descriptive trial one small randomize trial . LAA-CLOSURE trial aim assess efficacy safety prophylactic surgical closure LAA patient undergo aortic valve replacement .</detailed_description>
