	<detailed_description>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY : 1 . There exist significant systematic random error vivo spectroscopic measurement tissue hemoglobin concentration , blood oxygenation , scatter coefficient due uncontrolled probe-to-tissue interface lack real-time calibration . 2 . It possible design engineer fiber optic sensor perform accurate reproducible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy ( DRS ) noninvasive quantification tissue physiology morphology vivo . Features probe pressure control instrument self-calibration improve signal-to-noise ratio remove user bias optical measurement . STUDY OBJECTIVES 1 ) Evaluation pressure sensor healthy volunteer determine minimum contact pressure require spectroscopic measurement DESIGN AND PROCEDURES : Evaluation pressure sensor volunteer study ( n=10 ) Informed consent obtain volunteer . In order ass pressure sensor , research procedure repeat twice ( aid stepper motor without aid stepper motor . ) For first five subject , measurement make stepper motor first follow measurement without stepper motor . The remain five-subjects receive measurement reverse order ( stepper motor follow stepper motor ) . Before optical measurement , subject ask rinse mouth 0.9 % saline solution order minimize influence consume food . The instrument high-level disinfect prior use cidex sterilize ethylene oxide per standard clinical procedure . Furthermore , anticipated device pose significant risk vulnerable population . The probe cover optically clear protective sterile sheath place contact soft tissue . Reflectance measurement take volunteer 5 pressure level ( 25 , 50 , 75 , 100 , 150 mmHg ) . At pressure level 10 spectrum acquire sequentially . The first measurement start immediately desire probe pressure reach . This generate total 100 sample calibration spectra pair subject . This repeated site include tongue , cheek gum . The sample spectrum calibrate use calibration spectrum collect concurrently . Three tissue parameter use analyze pressure effect describe [ THb ] example : First , mean [ THb ] standard deviation calculate 10 repeat measurement pressure subject measurement without stepper motor plot probe pressure ( refer THb-P curve ) . Second , pressure level , [ THb ] plot time subject curve indicate temporal response tissue probe pressure . A series pair t-tests use identify contact pressure minimal [ THb ] variance occurs time ( stepper motor use ) . Next , variance contact pressure compare case without stepper motor demonstrate significant reduction pressure variance . The investigator anticipate risk participant , however , potential minimal risk loss confidentiality ; slight risk infection ; discomfort pressure sit ; jaw discomfort result mouth open several minute .</detailed_description>
