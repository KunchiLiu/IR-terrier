	<brief_title>Validation Wearable Sensor Stress Response Virtual Reality Environment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wearable sensor technology develop may allow , first time , ability individual well recognize level stress give situation continuous basis . A major focus many wearable sensor able accurately analyze track heart rate variability ( HRV ) , indicative primarily parasympathetic/vagal tone emotional state.3 However need validate reliability measure response understand inter-individual variability . The present study take advantage virtual reality scenario expose healthy volunteer control stressful situation monitor several standardized lab-based non-invasive physiological sensor well novel wrist band sensor device track individual response stress .</detailed_description>
