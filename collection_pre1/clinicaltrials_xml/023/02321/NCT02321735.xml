	<brief_summary>: Stages III IV serum ovarian cancer lethal gynecologic cancer ; however , advanced-stage ovarian cancer patient long-term survivor . These patient may provide key long-term survival bring hope woman Stages III IV ovarian cancer . There meaningful explanation patient ovarian cancer become long-term survivor quality life long initial diagnosis . This research project specifically determine molecular feature within tumor along genetic , quality life , lifestyle feature predict long-term survival patient Stages III IV ovarian cancer . It bring together sophisticated molecular technique , researcher longstanding interest , wide spectrum consumer advocate ( number long-term survivor ) , quality life expert analyze carefully maintain patient database worldâ€”the Gynecologic Oncology Group database . We anticipate result project identify specific biochemical pathway genetic feature associate long-term survival use improve treatment , survival , survivorship patient disease . There clearly something unique among patient survive Stage III IV ovarian cancer long term , believe understand , increase number long- longer-term survivor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Ovarian cancer ( OC ) remain major health problem United Sates ( US ) . In 2012 , estimate 22,280 case epithelial OC ( EOC ) result 15,500 death . While median survival OC patient improve last two decade , vast majority patient suffer relapse develop chemo-resistant disease . The overall survival patient suffer OC change appreciably last three decade . Despite dismal statistic , minority OC patient long-term ( LT ) survivor ( &gt; 10 year ) . This include subset advanced stage ( ~15 % ) high proportion early-stage disease ( 75 % ) . Unfortunately , little genomic biologic characterization tumor , patient-reported outcome characterize LT survivor . The clinical importance identify subset patient may may benefit therapy , understand biology tumor , significant patient survival quality life ( QOL ) standpoint . The characterization LT survivor advance stage OC potentially identify molecular clinical pathway target help woman short survival . Further , careful characterization patient , include initial longitudinal health-related QOL report , response treatment , tumor provide significant measure prognostic factor . Accurate identification woman high-grade , early stage OC recur allow tailor therapy benefit . Thus , systematic molecular patient-reported outcome evaluation LT survivor OC ( early advance stage ) yield data , significantly impact management OC patient . Overall Aim : To characterize genomic , biologic , biobehavioral basis LT survivor EOC . We hypothesize LT survivor OC distinct feature distinguish short-term ( ST ) survivor . Specific Aims 1 . To characterize genomic , biologic , immunologic feature tumor LT versus ST survivor advance stage EOC . We propose evaluate genomic feature ( copy number variation , miRNA methylation pattern ) LT ( &gt; 7 year ) versus ST survivor ( &lt; 2 year ) . In addition , case evaluate tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) . Correlations TILs genomic parameter examine along identification genomic/immune signatures predict LT survival . This aim leverage ongoing funded project characterize transcriptome advance stage OC use GOG trial . 2 . To validate genomic signature predict recurrence early-stage , high-grade EOC . This aim leverage ongoing DOD grant ( DOD # OC110628 ; Birrer , PI ) generate genomic signature ( transcriptome ) distinguish recurrent non-recurrent early-stage , high-grade EOC . 3 . To determine extent health-related QOL measure , additional patient-reported outcome ( PROs ) , key CTCAE criterion predict LT ovarian cancer survival . 4 . To examine exploratory aim , potential relationship health-related QOL , PROs , key CTCAE criterion genomic feature predict disease recurrence . Proposed Consortium : We propose utilize Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) infrastructure basis consortium , supplemented addition research site , administrative structure , advisory board , biostatistical support . We consider major advantage proposal de novo creation consortium necessary . GOG world 's leading clinical trial organization focus prevention , diagnosis , treatment gynecologic cancer . GOG include 391 medical institution participate GOG clinical trial . As , institution familiar GOG procedure include accurate collection clinical QOL data procure processing tissue specimen . GOG institution extensive infrastructure place conduct large-scale clinical research serve establish network key site project .</detailed_description>
