	<brief_title>Trial Behavior Change Intervention Increase Aerobic Resistance Exercise Quality Life Older Prostate Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recruitment Potential participant contact Newfoundland Labrador Cancer registry . They give brief explanation study ask consent mail-out questionnaire registry . The questionnaire contain cover letter explain study detail along informed consent . If participant wish continue study , return questionnaire research team , contact point . Participants also recruit presentation local support group well advertisement local paper poster local hospital recreation center . Power Analysis According G*Power sample 40 prostate breast cancer survivor per group ( n=120 ) need detect medium effect size ( d= .50 ) primary outcome ( i.e. , PA ) power 0.80 , p-level 0.05 . We expect 20 % attrition rate , base previous research ( McGowan , North , &amp; Courneya , 2013 ; Vallance , Courneya , Plotnikoff , Yasui , &amp; Mackey , 2007 ) therefore attempt recruit sample 150 breast prostate cancer survivor , would allow 50 participant per group . Data Analysis Analyses covariance use examine group difference primary outcome ( i.e. , PA minute/week ) month 1 month 3 , secondary outcome ( e.g. , QoL ) month 3 . Additional analysis covariance run explore group difference sedentary behaviour , light , moderate vigorous minute activity/week month 1 month 3 . Medical ( e.g. , comorbidities , month since diagnosis ) demographic ( e.g. , marital status , age , BMI ) test possible moderator PA behaviour change . If experience large proportion miss data multiple imputation technique SPSS use replace miss value . Otherwise , last outcome carry forward approach use . The relationship self-reported PA QoL , objectively measure PA QoL old breast prostate cancer survivor explore . To examine , difference QoL participant two PA category ( i.e. , meet PA guideline meet PA guideline ) test use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . These analysis repeat use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) control demographic medical variable statistically significant association QoL . The relationship objectively measure PA self-reported PA explore use two-way mixed intraclass correlation coefficient calculate level absolute agreement two type measurement .</detailed_description>
