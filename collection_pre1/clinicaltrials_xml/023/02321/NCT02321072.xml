	<detailed_description>Rationale : Contrary hypoxia , many physician consider hyperoxia harmful patient . To prevent hypoxia , superfluous administration oxygen common practice , hyperoxia see many patient , especially Intensive Care unit . However , increase number study confirm know negative pulmonary effect chronic oxygen oversupply , also important acute circulatory effect , characterise decreased cardiac output ( CO ) , increase systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) , impaired microvascular perfusion . These phenomena impair perfusion organ , may outweigh high arterial oxygen content , result net loss oxygen delivery perturb organ function . This may example responsible hyperoxia-associated increase infarct size increase mortality myocardial infarction cardiac arrest . The underlying mechanism clarify yet , probably involve increase oxidative stress systemic vasoconstriction . On hand , hyperoxia also induce several favourable effect . The majority ICU-patients systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) concomitant vasoplegia due trauma , sepsis ischemia/reperfusion injury . Vasoconstriction could benefit patient severe SIRS , reduce need intravenous volume resuscitation vasopressor requirement . Furthermore , hyperoxia may exert precondition effect patient ischemia/reperfusion injury prevent new infection due antibacterial property . Hypothesis : Hyperoxia SIRS ultimately unfavourable effect organ function , especially long term . Objectives : 1 . To study short- long-term effect two different PaO2 target circulatory status , organ dysfunction outcome . 2 . To study underlying mechanism hyperoxia determine difference oxidative stress response hyperoxic normoxic patient . Study design : Randomized , prospective multicentre clinical trial Study population : Patients admit Intensive Care unit ≥ 2 positive SIRS-criteria expect ICU stay 48 hour Intervention : We investigate 2 group PaO2 target within range current practice Group 1 : target PaO2 120 ( 105 - 135 ) mmHg ( high-normal ) Group 2 : target PaO2 75 ( 60 - 90 ) mmHg ( low-normal )</detailed_description>
