	<detailed_description>Caudal epidural injection commonly perform regional anesthetic procedure infant child use provide perioperative analgesia many low abdominal , low extremity , urological procedure . Utilizing sterile technique , needle advanced sacral hiatus local anesthetic inject epidural space . Local anesthetic spread cranially result significant sensory ( +/- motor ) blockade , depend local anesthetic concentration volume1 . Recent study use ultrasound assess cranial spread caudal blockade , specifically evaluate speed injection different volume affect cranial spread2,4 . Other study investigate redistribution secondary spread initial injection local anesthetic utilizing ultrasound assessment epidural space3 . Although current standard exist confirm successful caudal epidural injection , several finding may indicate proper needle position predict successful block5 . Some finding include : tactile appreciation `` pop '' sacrococcygeal ligament , negative blood cerebrospinal fluid aspiration , negative test dose , appropriate resistance injection , subcutaneous swell injection , motor hemodynamic response skin incision , need administration supplemental analgesic . Although several study show real-time ultrasound guidance use needle insertion caudal block , guarantee adequate cranial spread may technically challenge trainee perform block . Furthermore , many tactile finding indicate successful entry appropriate space appreciate trainee , supervise anesthesiologist , complicate supervision technique . At present , difficulty reliably predict block failure may lead overuse narcotics prevent pain patient potentially fail block could lead inadequate analgesia patient young reliably communicate pain level . The purpose study evaluate whether utilize ultrasound assessment caudal epidural injection reliably identify unrecognized unsuccessful nerve block procedure , guide proper technique , alter pain management outcome measurement patient . The propose study change current practice regard patient selection caudal epidural injection change performance procedure . This study may impact practice general pediatric anesthesiologist provide evidence ultrasound useful tool determine successful caudal epidural injection , may help identify unrecognized fail block earlier evaluate level ( ) anesthesia training would benefit assessment tool . Patients randomize use pre-made folder contain assignment either control group study group . In study group , ultrasound utilized caudal block confirm placement . In control group , caudal block do without ultrasound assist caudal epidural injection . In operating room , anesthesia team prepare begin caudal epidural injection , patient place lateral decubitus prone position , knees hip flexed . The attend caudal block mark site patient per site marking policy Lurie Children 's ; necessarily attend record remainder case . Once sacrum prepped , anesthesia provider proceed caudal epidural injection usual fashion . The injected solution 1 mL/kg 0.2 % ropivacaine 1:200k epinephrine , round next mL , consistent current standard practice Lurie Children 's . After injection test dose ( 10 % total block volume ) , one-minute pause begin assess response . During pause , prior injection remain dose local anesthetic , 13-6 MHz , linear ultrasound probe sterile cover ultrasound gel place patient 's lumbar spine , cranial point entry caudal block . The caudal block needle insertion site sterile field observe undisturbed . The ultrasound probe position paramedian along non-dependent side spine , obtain long axis view epidural intrathecal space . The cephalad end probe place level iliac crest . Once ultrasound probe position properly one-minute pause finish , remain dose local anesthetic administer anesthesia provider ultrasound clip epidural spread visualize . The supervise attend anesthesiologist one list personnel form . In either group , attend anesthesiologist coach resident help guide success base standard care block . In control group , felt trainee unable safely successfully perform block base typically utilized method assessment ( injection pressure , needle appearance , subcutaneous swell ) attend take block , consistent current practice Lurie Children 's . In study group , attend continue use traditional method assessment also utilize ultrasound ass block success may either take block time injection determine unsuccessful may redirect trainee success performance block . As part research protocol , primary anesthesia team avoid give patient analgesic medication prior time incision . Additionally , anesthesia team patient 1 MAC sevoflurane avoid use nitrous oxide , time incision . After incision , anesthetic decision discretion attend anesthesiologist record operating room . Data collect level training physician performing procedure , proceduralist 's experience level , finding procedure , confidence level block success . Subsequent data collect response skin incision need supplemental analgesia . In recovery room , pain score assess time phase 1 recovery discharge . Recovery room staff advise give analgesic medication , standardize 0.05 mg/kg morphine , pain rat &gt; 4 rFLACC scale , appropriate patient ' age . The ultrasound probe placement , image acquisition , survey administration , pre-incision anesthetic standardization , recovery room analgesic administration threshold research-related procedure . All element patient care describe , include withhold additional analgesic incision , consistent current standard care standard practice Lurie Children 's . The length study visit time operation PACU discharge , intervention take place operation . Caudal analgesia rat successful 2 condition fulfil : ( 1 ) procedure perform without physical assistance supervisor , verbal comment suggestion allow , 3 pass needle skin need , ( 2 ) clinical success block . Clinical failure define need opioid supplementation increase concentration volatile anesthetic response clinical sign insufficient analgesia include increase heart rate , blood pressure , movement patient , sign stress incision procedure . The attend anesthesiologist predict whether caudal block successful base clinical indicator alone control group base ultrasound finding study group . This assessment confidence block must make emergence anesthesia .</detailed_description>
