	<brief_title>Dual Energy Computerized Tomography ( DE-CT ) Patients With Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Intestinal stricture common patient Crohn 's ( CD ) disease may result intestinal obstruction . Current available imaging study usually identify locate stricture , reliably differentiate patient require surgery respond medical therapy . Dual Energy computerize tomography ( DE-CT ) use two energy source use high low tube voltage , thus create two data set . Dedicated software create overlay low high energy image , enhancement tissue iodine well appreciate quantified compare standard CT . The investigator hypothesize dual energy well visualize iodine uptake bowl wall marker inflammation within intestinal lesion , may help identify patient require surgery . AIM To evaluate efficacy DE-CT study predict need surgery within 3 month . METHODS Patients known CD undergo abdominal CT possible obstructive presentation prospectively underwent DE-CT use intravenous iodinate contrast material , follow 3 month outcome surgery . The DE-CT interpreted radiologist blind clinical outcome , attend physician patient blind interpretation DE-CT. DE-CT parameter compare patient underwent surgery . Receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis use find optimal cut point distinguish patient eventually underwent surgery . Based cut point find ROC analysis , negative positive predictive value calculate .</detailed_description>
