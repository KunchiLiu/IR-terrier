	<brief_title>A Pilot Clinical Trial Oral Ketamine Acute Pain Management After Amputation Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective open-label clinical trial decrease incidence expect side effect oral ketamine dose administer presurgery postsurgery , 10 subject undergoing elective amputation lower extremity . The primary outcome measure incidence adverse event . Secondary outcome measure decrease acute pain level decrease incidence stump phantom limb pain 6 month . Enrollment participant occur Rush University Medical Center ( Rush ) , Chicago , IL . Consented participant include study undergo elective amputation lower extremity cause . Rationale use oral ketamine acute pain amputation surgery : The common analgesic , morphine , narrow therapeutic window numerous side effects.1 Ketamine , chemically stable compound , non-opioid analgesic property low dos . In addition , ketamine stimulate cardio-respiratory system great benefit injure patients.2-4 Ketamine generally administer intravenous ( IV ) route provide analgesia via antagonism N-Methyl-D-Asparate ( NMDA ) receptor . Ketamine add benefit wide therapeutic safety index . IV ketamine show provide postoperative analgesia many clinical trial ; particular reduce opioid consumption.5 Severe acute pain show progress chronic pain due central sensitization.6 Perioperative IV ketamine show limited study decrease incidence chronic pain surgery . However , IV route administration ketamine limitation due difficulty IV placement certain tactical situation . Therefore , use oral ketamine ( non-opioid ) purpose acute pain management trauma surgery highly desirable . Pharmacokinetic study : Oral ketamine may seem disadvantageous 17 % bioavailability , mainly due first-pass drug metabolism liver . However , wide variability bioavailability patient-to-patient ( mean 16.6 % , SE = 2.8 % ) hence predictable oral dosing achieve . Although investigator test formulation sublingual buccal transmucosal administration ketamine , practice fail increase ketamine bioavailability versus oral ketamine . Ketamine nasal spray problematic acute use , since amount drug difficult control use atomizer . Day 1 ( day surgery ) Before Surgery : An analgesic dose oral ketamine ( 1.0 mg/kg ) administer one hour surgery preoperative hold area . If subject experience adverse event ( e.g . hallucination ) 1.0 mg/kg pre-surgery dose ketamine , ketamine dose delayed follow day ( Day 2 ) . In addition , subsequent subject receive 33 % reduction pre-surgery dose ( i.e . 0.67 mg/kg ) . After Surgery : In recovery room , subject able swallow , adverse event pre-surgery ketamine dose , oral ketamine ( 1.0 mg/kg ) administer ( earlier 8 hour pre-surgery dose ) . No dos administer midnight . If adverse event resolve next morning ( Day 2 ) , oral ketamine discontinue . In addition , subsequent subject receive 33 % reduction recovery room dose and/or last dose Day 1 . Day 2 ( first post-op day ) Subjects receive oral ketamine ( 1.0 mg/kg ) 3 times/day . The first dose administer 6 AM .If subject experience adverse event first dose , one resolve within 8 hour dose , second dose reduce 33 % ( 1.0 mg/mg 0.67 mg/kg ) . If subject experience adverse event second dose , one resolve within 8 hour , dose reduce 33 % ( 0.67 mg/kg 0.45 mg/kg ) . If dose reduction protocol eliminate adverse event , oral ketamine discontinue . In addition , subsequent subject receive 33 % reduction Day 2 oral ketamine dos Day 3 ( second post-op day ) ( Tapering Down Period ) Subjects receive oral ketamine half previous day final dose ( 0.5 mg/kg dose reduction occur ) , 3 time day . For example , subject ' dose already 0.45 mg/kg previous day reduction , third day dose 0.23 mg/kg . The first dose administer 6 AM . Even third day adverse event dose , one resolve within 8 hour dose , continue reduce dose 33 % . If dose reduction protocol eliminate adverse event , subject receive ketamine . In addition , subsequent subject receive 33 % reduction Day 3 oral ketamine dos . While hospital 3 day , breakthrough pain occur , subject receive standard care pain control medication . All subject discharge accord standard discharge protocol . Anticipated Adverse Events If subject experience adverse event , subject closely monitor every hour event resolve . Adverse event duration resolution time record . If adverse event resolve , next schedule dose reduce 33 % . Each adverse event assess Principal Investigator clinical relevance determination make .</detailed_description>
