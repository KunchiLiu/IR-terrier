	<detailed_description>Background : Non-ambulatory child neuromuscular disability spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) significant risk poor bone health define low bone mineral density ( BMD ) increase propensity fracture . Poor bone health thought relate , least part , abnormally low level load experience skeleton . A common physical approach increase bone density stimulate musculoskeletal system increase amount duration weight-bearing low extremity . For non-ambulatory individual , take form use assist stand device enable child spend time stand position degree weight place low limb . Some physical intervention demonstrate variable improvement BMD child neuromuscular condition , . A serious limitation previous work area failure objectively measure magnitude duration load experience low extremity . Thus , lack change BMD may due extremity experience fraction body weight ( due load-sharing assistive device ) inadequate duration stand time . Methods : In order investigate efficacy stand treatment increase BMD , develop simple , portable inexpensive transducer measure magnitude time course load experience low extremity individual SMA use stationary assist stand device . This transducer consist array sensor embed within mat place individual 's foot assist stand . A prototype validate compare output load-sensing mat know load apply surface mat statically . The specific characteristic load low extremity subject correlate change BMD obtain true outcome assessment . As demonstration approach , recruit 3 child SMA Gillette Children 's Specialty Healthcare currently participate stand program . Once enrol informed consent obtain , participant use mat provide collect load duration data baseline period continue stand program , subsequent intervention period increase duration stand . The specific goal propose project develop , validate establish initial feasibility measurement device . Implications : Successful completion propose project provide necessary groundwork move forward multicenter clinical trial large number subject variety neuromuscular condition . The measurement device allow u correlate change BMD specific load history participant , thereby allow u determine whether physical intervention lead increase BMD individual neuromuscular disability . Analysis data help define dose-dependent relationship load , duration change BMD , thereby guide provider therapist prescribe stand intervention .</detailed_description>
