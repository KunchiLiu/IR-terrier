	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize clinical trial determine compare clinical cost effectiveness three method exercise therapy treatment patient intermittent claudication . The method test hospital-based ( SET ) home-based ( HET ) supervise exercise program unsupervised walk advice ( WA ) patient follow 12 month . Unsupervised WA consist advice least 30 minute walk Nordic Poles ( NP ) least three time per week basic treatment , include best medical treatment , use three treatment group . In addition basic treatment , SET group patient first six month participate group-based exercise therapy hospital 50 minute three time weekly , supervise physiotherapist . The HET group patient perform exercise home 50 minute three time weekly six month receive feedback physiotherapist phone call every 14th day . The SET HET group patient recommend continue 50 minute three time weekly exercise therapy home without supervision last six month . Primary outcome change baseline 12 month walk distance six minute hospital corridor ( 6MWT ) co-primary outcome change baseline 12 month health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) use SF36 questionnaire . Secondary outcome include fulfillment patient-specified goal treatment ( PSFS ) , change health-related quality-of-life ( HRQoL ) disease-specific instrument ( VascuQoL ) , walk impairment measure Walking Impairment Questionnaire , physical activity ( accelerometer ) compliance physical exercise therapy ( patient diary ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hospital- Home-based Supervised Exercise Versus UNsupervised Walk Advice For Patients With InTermittent Claudication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Intermittent claudication usually cause atherosclerotic stenosis and/or occlusion artery legs affect 7 % Swedish population age 60 year . Evidence-based treatment best medical treatment ( BMT ) exercise therapy . Best medical treatment include treatment risk factor arteriosclerosis . Regarding exercise therapy , in-hospital supervised exercise therapy ( SET ) grade treadmill know improve walk performance measure grade treadmill three six month . There scarce data long-term result limit data regard improvement health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) SET . In country , walk advice ( WA ) routine clinical practice resource SET often lack . Invasive treatment ( surgical endovascular ) rarely required patient intermittent claudication . New technique ( GPS accelerometer ) enable measurement physical activity training home environment . The use technique could facilitate home-based ( HET ) instead hospital-based supervised exercise ( SET ) therapy provide caregiver data could use feedback patient order obtain optimal patient benefit exercise therapy . This raise hope result long-term compliance exercise therapy may improve . Aim : patient intermittent claudication ( IC ) require invasive treatment evaluate walking performance , HRQoL , fulfillment patient-defined goal treatment , walk impairment , long-term compliance exercise therapy , physical activity cost-effectiveness different exercise therapy modality order define effective cost effective treatment . One hundred sixty-five IC patient request treatment IC symptom vascular surgical department Sahlgrenska University Hospital Södra Älvsborg Hospital , Sweden invasive treatment consider necessary randomize ( computerized adaptive stratify randomization ) 1 . WA Nordic Poles ( NP ) + best medical treatment ( BMT ) , 2 . WA NP + BMT + SET , 3 . WA NP + BMT + HET All randomize patient recommend outdoor walk NP least 30 minute least three time per week . The SET group addition receive in-hospital muscle exercise therapy group supervise physiotherapist three time weekly six month . The HET group patient perform muscle exercise therapy home feedback every 14th day physiotherapist six month . After six month supervise exercise therapy , SET HET patient recommend continue muscle exercise therapy home , without feedback , seven 12 month . The patient follow blind observer ( physiotherapist unaware patient´s randomize group ) three , six 12 month . Primary outcome : change baseline 12 month walk distance six-minutes-walk-test ( 6MWT ) co-primary outcome : change baseline 12 month health-related quality life ( SF36 ) . Secondary outcome : walk impairment measure Walking Impairment Questionnaire ( WIQ ) , fulfillment patient-defined goal ( Patient-Specific-Functional Scale ) , physical activity ( accelerometer ) , compliance exercise therapy ( patient diary ) , disease-specific HRQoL ( VascuQol ) cost-effectiveness . Also change time ( baseline three , baseline six six 12 month ) study . It important determine whether supervised exercise therapy modality ( SET HET ) equivalent result well WA NP BMT alone . The trial design answer question whether HET significantly less clinically effective SET whether SET clinically effective WA NP BMT . The study start September 2014 , inclusion expect stop September 2016 end follow-up September 2017 .</detailed_description>
