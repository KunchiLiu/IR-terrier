	<brief_summary>Patients cancer high risk deep vein thrombosis often develop vein low limb . The initial evaluation clinically suspect deep vein thrombosis include estimation clinical probability calculate risk score Wells score measurement D-dimer . However , usefulness accuracy clinical score d-dimer test low patient cancer often undergo unnecessary ( serial ) ultrasonography . The aim current study analyze variable predict presence thrombosis may improve accuracy Wells score . In addition , various cut-off d-dimer evaluate goal improve sensibility specificity test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients cancer high risk pulmonary embolism deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) . The approach clinically suspect deep vein thrombosis start evaluation clinical probability disease follow measurement circulating level D-dimer . The presence thrombus objectively demonstrate compression ultrasonography . In patient without cancer clinically suspect DVT , low clinical probability combine normal d-dimer result exclude presence DVT compression ultrasonography withheld . In patient cancer , sign symptom cancer disease may mimic DVT shift result clinical probability score towards high probability . In addition , presence cancer part Wells score increase chance end high overall score thus high probability . Eventually , patient cancer often classify high clinical probability patient without cancer . The d-dimer test poorly specific presence cancer disease result often positive consequence cancer , cancer treatment concomitant comorbidities . As result poor specificity clinical score d-dimer test , initial diagnostic step limited usefulness patient cancer often need undergo ultrasonography . The aim current study analyze variable predict presence thrombosis may improve accuracy Wells score . In addition , various cut-offs D-dimer evaluate goal improve sensibility specificity test . Study design : prospective cohort cancer patient clinically suspect DVT . Objectives : evaluate clinical demographic variable predict presence DVT may improve accuracy Wells score cancer patient . The sensibility specificity different cut-offs D-dimer also evaluate . Inclusion criteria All ambulatory cancer patient clinically suspect DVT . All patient manage calculation Wells score , measurement D-dimer . The presence DVT ascertain whole-leg ultrasonography perform independently result Wells D-dimer . A phone contact/visit 3 month verify development venous thromboembolic complication patient DVT initially exclude ultrasonography .</detailed_description>
