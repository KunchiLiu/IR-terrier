	<brief_summary>Early change associate development smoking-induced disease , e.g. , COPD lung cancer ( two commonest cause death U.S. ) often characterize abnormal airway epithelial differentiation . Airway basal cell ( BC ) stem/progenitor cell necessary generation differentiate airway epithelium . Based preliminary observation SAE BC cell FGFR2 signaling , hypothesize suppression FGFR2 signal SAE BC stem/progenitor cell cigarette smoke render cell less potent generate maintain normally differentiate SAE , shift cell towards COPD associate phenotype . To test , SAE basal cell isolate cultured cell obtain bronchoscopic brushing analyze vitro assay stem/progenitor capacity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Changes within small airway lung represent key element mechanism COPD , precede development emphysema contribute progressive decline expiratory airflow . One key feature COPD remodel small airway epithelium ( SAE ) , COPD SAE phenotype often induce smoke broad gene expression change SAE . Many specific mechanism maintenance regeneration small airway differentiate SAE adult human lung largely unknown , smoke associate defect maintenance SAE may early event COPD . Preliminary data murine study indicate fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ( FGFR2 ) signal critical lung architecture development , preliminary evidence show FGFR2 pathway regulate within small airway epithelium ( SAE ) smokers smoker COPD . We hypothesize suppression FGFR2 signal SAE BC stem cell cigarette smoke cause cell become less potent , shift expression normally differentiate SAE towards COPD-associated small airway phenotype therefore affect generation maintenance cell . Using technology establish laboratory , pure population BC isolate SAE healthy nonsmoker , healthy smoker , COPD smoker . The stem/progenitor cell capacity SAE BC group analyze use 3D modeling . The basic mechanism COPD test focus phenotype present lung COPD patient comparison nonsmoker healthy smoker counterpart . The 3 aim assess parallel , aim share biologic sample : Aim 1 ( n=60 ) . To determine whether BC SAE COPD smoker reduce capacity generate normally differentiate SAE , e.g initiate airway branch repair response injury vitro generate airway epithelium phenotype similar present SAE COPD smoker vivo . Aim 2 ( n=20 ) . To test hypothesis FGFR2 signal necessary normal SAE BC stem cell function suppression FGFR2 cause inhibitor smoke associated factor ( EGF TGF- beta ) lead altered stem cell functional phenotype similar SAE BC COPD smoker reduce capacity characterize Aim 1 . Aim 3 ( n=40 ) . To assess hypothesis increase FGFR2 signal suppress smoking induce EGF receptor TGF-beta pathway restore FGFR2 expression normalize capacity SAE BC stem cell generate maintain normally differentiate SAE .</detailed_description>
