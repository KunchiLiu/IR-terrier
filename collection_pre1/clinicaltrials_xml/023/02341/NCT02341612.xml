	<brief_summary>Subjects randomly place five group : ( 1 ) single exposure 5째C cold water immersion , ( 2 ) single exposure 15째C cold water immersion , ( 3 ) multiple exposures 10째C cold water immersion , ( 4 ) whole body cryotherapy ( WBC ) 110째C ( 5 ) passive recovery ( control group ) . The single exposure group perform cold water immersion immediately exercise-induced muscle damage ( EIMD ) 20 minute . The multiple exposure group perform cold water immersion immediately , 24h , 48h 72h EIMD ( day ) 20 minute . The WBC group remain cabin immediately EIMD 3 min . The control group expose treatment EIMD protocol . The subject ask visit laboratory seven occasion . The first visit familiarization subject experimental procedure anthropometric assessment . One week familiarization , visit two , volunteer perform exercise-induced muscle damage ( EIMD ) protocol allocate one experimental group . Indirect marker muscle damage inflammatory response evaluate baseline ( pre ) , immediately post , 24h , 48h , 72h , 96h , 168h follow EIMD protocol measure anterior thigh muscle swelling , isometric knee extensor peak torque , knee extensor muscle soreness , countermovement vertical jump blood sample analyzes .</brief_summary>
