	<detailed_description>This study evaluate efficacy newly develop serious game , SCI HARD , enhance self-management skill , self-reported health behavior , QOL among adolescent young adult spinal cord injury disease ( SCI/D ) . SCI HARD design project PI , Dr. Meade , collaboration UM3D Lab 2010 2013 funding NIDRR ( National Institute Disability Rehabilitation Research ) Field Initiated Development Grant assist person SCI develop apply necessary skill keep body healthy manage many aspect SCI care . The study make unique contribution rehabilitation emphasize concept personal responsibility control one 's health life whole . By select innovative approach program implementation , also attempt address high cost care delivery lack health care access underserved population SCI/D living across United States ( US ) . BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW As defined computer game industry , serious game `` game design primary purpose pure entertainment . '' Serious game base development self-management skill develop asthma , diabetes , safe sex negotiation , promote nutrition physical activity . They effective improve self-care , increase self-efficacy , reduce symptom , minimize secondary condition , reduce emergency room visit decrease health care cost . The game application assess project base self-management principle specifically Health Mechanics Program , evidence-based self-management program develop Dr. Meade . Many individual sustain traumatic SCI millennial generation . While mean age individual SCI 40.2 year old , approximately half 16 29 age range time injury . Younger patient traumatic SCI overwhelmingly male , many need medical care first time life . These individual likely single ( never-married ) many high-school education less . A significant component group injure participation high-risk behavior act violence ; group tend low literacy level few resource , many ethnic racial minority background . As previously discuss , individual group , tend high degree technical sophistication leveraged promote transfer knowledge self-management skill . In particular , game download play mobile platform , smartphone , likely access played member group . Data Pew Internet American Life Project indicate Americans age 16 24 play computer electronic game - include 97 % American teenager 81 % adult 18 29 year old . African Americans appear equally likely play electronic game Non-Hispanic Whites ( 51 % ) English-Speaking Hispanics appear likely ( 63 % ; though attribute youth group ) . While adult gamers play computer ( 73 % ) , teens young adult increasingly play portable gaming device ( 62 % ) cell phone ( 50 % ) . African Americans Hispanics likely non-Hispanic , Whites play game small , mobile gadget . 55 % teen portable game device , 74 % iPod MP3 player , 60 % desktop laptop computer . Data recent survey conduct Dr. Meade colleague confirms use technology individual SCI . They send mail survey population individual SCI age 8 old identify treat U-M within past 10 year . Among individual appear valid address ( n=780 ) , approximately 40 % ( n=317 ) respond . While individual own computer many own type device , half 13 29 year old own use mobile device could use gaming ( e.g. , iPad , iPhone , Android table / phone ) . INTERVENTION SCI HARD design base need strengths individual SCI/D responsive identify gap challenge health care provision population . Current theory health behavior standard practice game development shape development . In particular , refer previously describe model propose Ritterband et al . behavior change use internet intervention prioritize fun engagement design process . The program focus enhance skill , encourage positive health behavior empower people within environment , recognize people different resource ability . By teach skill well manage health , self-management program reduce occurrence complication also promote high level social integration QOL . In particular , playing game allow player recognize consequence behavior action inaction tie visible result substantial change statistic . As currently develop , SCI Hard available IOS ( Apple Mobile Operating System ) Android platform . Play time approximately 5 hour require individual able successfully manage health able complete level . Purpose Objectives The overall purpose evaluate effect serious game SCI Hard self-management skill , positive health behavior QOL . The program specifically target adolescent young adult SCI/D . Objectives : 1 ) improve self-management skill , include problem-solving , attitude disability , self-efficacy manage health ; 2 ) increase performance recommend health management behavior ; 3 ) improve QOL ; 4 ) determine extent dosage game play impact change factor . . All hypothesis posit , follow intervention , difference exist participant SCI Hard show positive outcome control group member ( assessment group difference ) difference sustain time ( assessment within group difference ) . It expect , intervention group , degree engagement game ( dosage play time ) influence degree improvement , thus interest examine within group difference . Research Hypotheses H1 : SCI Hard participants show great improvement problem solve skill , healthy attitude disability , SCI Self-efficacy control group member ; improvement sustain time within group . H2 : SCI Hard participant endorse positive health behavior control group member ; improvement sustain time within group . H3 : SCI Hard participants high level QOL control group member ; difference sustain time within group . H4 : Among SCI Hard participant , dosage game play relate degree change self-management skill , health behavior QOL .</detailed_description>
