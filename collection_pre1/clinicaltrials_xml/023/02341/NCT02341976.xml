	<detailed_description>Urinary incontinence common problem due weak pelvic floor muscle associate decrease quality life . The vibration exercise associated improvement muscle component . Due , research propose technique could apply weak pelvic floor . However , unknown vibration training high impact pelvic floor muscle urinary sphincter , objectives study validate data necessary . The purpose research evaluate activity urinary sphincter pelvic floor muscle vibratory platform training woman . Subjects recruit , criterion exclusion evaluate , age , BMI record . Each subject exercise vibratory platform 3 different position , one 2 different frequency 1 minute position frequency . Pelvic electromyography ( EMG ) ass activity urinary sphincter pelvic floor muscle vibratory exercise . Data collect procedure . According purpose anticipate impact research extrapolate whole body vibration ( WBV ) train program improve strength pelvic floor muscle elaborate guide plan improve clinical outcome quality life patient suffer urinary incontinence new nonsurgical treatment approach woman mild moderate stress urinary incontinence , well research allow u increase knowledge urinary continence pelvic floor .</detailed_description>
