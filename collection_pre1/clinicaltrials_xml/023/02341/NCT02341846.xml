	<detailed_description>Cancer increase incidence prevalence United Kingdom . Pain frequent complication cancer cancer pain control frequently suboptimal . Previous research establish several potentially modifiable reason suboptimal cancer pain management . These include : under-reporting pain ; inadequate communication pain patient health care professional ; inadequate assessment pain health care provider ; inadequate analgesic prescribing ; suboptimal adherence prescribe analgesic regimen patient ; failure re-assess pain timeously . Information communication technology ( ICT ) term use describe digital technology facilitate electronic capture , processing , storage , exchange information . ICT could offer innovative solution suboptimal cancer pain management . Technological solution might include electronic diary , available application `` apps '' , could encourage pain self-monitoring people cancer , prompt medical assessment pain poorly control . Accurate patient report pain data could help professional adequately assess pain might influence patient-professional consultation . Feedback adherence data patient carers might improve way medication use . Electronic medication adherence device currently available capture data analgesic utilisation timing . This data might useful health care professional inform safe timely adjustment analgesic dos ( i.e . pain control poor inadequate analgesic dose non-adherence prescribed regime ? ) . The aim propose study explore desirability , feasibility , practicality use ICT improve cancer pain management The propose study would seek view patient cancer pain , caregiver , health care professional , use technology help cancer pain management . The study investigate acceptability electronic pain diary electronic medication adherence device patient health care professional , barrier use technology , data generate technology might use patient , caregiver , health care professional improve cancer pain management . This study form part programme research data propose study use inform potential development technological intervention improve management cancer pain community .</detailed_description>
