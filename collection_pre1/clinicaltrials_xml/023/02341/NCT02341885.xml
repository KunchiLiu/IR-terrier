	<brief_title>PrEvalence Acute Chronic Kidney Disease Treated Renal Replacement Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) common find intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient . Approximately 30 65 % patient experience episode AKI , 5 % ICU patient treat renal replacement therapy . AKI associate withimportant short term long-term morbidity well mortality , therefore also cost . Finally , close link chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) AKI . CKD patient great risk develop AKI , survivor AKI treat renal replacement therapy ( AKI-RRT ) , may develop chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) end stage kidney disease ( ESKD ) . Different aspect RRT modality may impact outcome , data emerge last decade improve evidence also reject commonly accepted dogma . Initial data suggest well outcome high dose treatment apply [ 5,6 ] . However , one small two large prospective randomise control trial fail reproduce earlier finding . Observational data seem suggest continuous RRT ( CRRT ) modality associate well outcome . However , relative small , randomized study meta-analyses demonstrate benefit . Observational data suggest CRRT associate improved renal recovery , also examine data 2 large randomize study intensity RRT suggest CRRT confers benefit . Also , despite RRT available 50 year clear consensus guideline initiation RRT . A recent survey find 89 different combination indication use . Recently , Acute Kidney Injury Network Kidney Disease : Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) group , formulate recommendation . Recent observational study indicate commonly accept cut offs serum urea concentration probably important . Furthermore , time initiation may effect outcome . Some study suggest early initiation associate well outcome , hand others could demonstrate benefit even demonstrate inferior outcome . The recent survey Europe show CRRT preferred modality among intensivists , despite recently publish evidence treatment dose similar decade ago . Data use renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) AKI CKD ICU patient either specific patient group , cardiac surgery patient , base survey , date back least decade . Furthermore , study suffer exclusion bias , patient fulfil criterion initiation RTT , deny RRT , consider . That may important consideration illustrate finding recent small single centre study demonstrate similar mortality rate RIFLE-F patient treat RRT . Therefore , Acute Kidney Injury Network ( AKIN ) recommend measure epidemiology AKI . The investigator anticipate evidence generate different topic RRT ICU patient may influence current practice . Also , investigator anticipate regional difference RRT practice .</detailed_description>
