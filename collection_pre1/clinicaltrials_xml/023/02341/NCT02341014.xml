	<criteria>Pathologically confirm B Tcell lymphomas enrol institution , include stage ≥ Ib CTCL , relapse progress least one systemic therapy . Hodgkin lymphoma allow classify Bcell lymphoma phase IIA portion . Age ≥ 18 , Previous systemic anticancer therapy must discontinue least 3 week prior treatment adverse effect must resolve ≤Grade 1 baseline . In phase IIa portion , progress subject , 2 week washout may allow discussion MSK Principal Investigator . Previous radiation , hormonal therapy , and/or surgery must discontinue complete least 2 week prior treatment study adverse effect must resolve . Lymph node diagnostic biopsy within 2 week consider exclusionary . ECOG ≤ 2 Meet follow laboratory criterion : Absolute neutrophil count 1.0/mm³ , Platelet count 80 K/μ ( Phase II portion , thrombocytopenia due bone marrow involvement platelet count must 50 K/μL ) , Phase Ib subject must calculate creatinine clearance 50ml/min CockcroftGault formula , phase IIa subject must calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 40ml4/min CockcroftGault formula . Total bilirubin 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) 3 x ULN Measurable disease phase IIa portion . Lymphoma ( include CTCL patient without evidence disease skin ) : CT PET/CT modify Cheson criterion incorporation PET . CTCL : mSWAT &gt; 0 , absolute Sezary count ≥ 1000 cells/μL . All study participant must register mandatory Revlimid REMS ® program , willing able comply requirement REMS ® program . Short course systemic corticosteroid disease control , improvement performance status noncancer indication ( &lt; 7 day ) must discontinue least 6 day prior study treatment . Stable ongoing corticosteroid use ( ≥ 30 day ) equivalent dose 15 mg prednisone permissible . Topical steroid use &gt; 3 week may continue ( CTCL ) . Women reproductive potential must adhere scheduled pregnancy test require Revlimid REMS® program . Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even successful vasectomy . See Appendix A : Risks Fetal Exposure , Pregnancy Testing Guidelines Acceptable Birth Control Methods . A female reproductive potential sexually mature female : undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ( i.e . menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . Patients standard curative option lymphoid malignancy current state disease exclude . For eligibility trial , allogeneic stem cell transplantation consider standard curative option . Any serious medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject signing informed consent form . Pregnant female . ( Lactating female must agree breast feed take carfilzomib , lenalidomide romidepsin ) . Known hypersensitivity thalidomide . The development erythema multiforme characterize desquamate rash take thalidomide similar drug . Prior use lenalidomide discontinue due toxicity . Prior therapy romidepsin discontinue due toxicity . Prior therapy carfilzomib discontinue due toxicity . Prior therapy proteasome inhibitor discontinue due toxicity . Concurrent use anticancer agent treatment . Known seropositive require antiviral therapy human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . Concurrent malignancy require active therapy . Patients one type lymphoma may enrol discussion MSK Principal Investigator . Known central nervous system meningeal involvement ( absence symptom investigation central nervous system involvement require ) . The follow known cardiac abnormality : Congenital long QT syndrome . QTc/QTf interval ≥ 480 millisecond ; unless secondary pacemaker bundle branch block . Myocardial infarction within 6 month cycle one , day one ( C1D1 ) . Subjects history myocardial infarction 6 12 month prior C1D1 asymptomatic negative cardiac risk assessment ( treadmill stress test , nuclear medicine stress test , stress echocardiogram ) since event may participate . Other significant ECG abnormality include 2nd degree atrioventricular ( AV ) block type II , 3rd degree AV block . Symptomatic coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , e.g. , angina Canadian Class IIIV ( see Appendix B ) . In patient doubt , patient stress image study , abnormal , angiography define whether CAD present . An ECG record screen show evidence cardiac ischemia ( ST depression ≥2 mm , measure isoelectric line ST segment ) . If doubt , patient stress image study , abnormal , angiography define whether CAD present . Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) meet New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II IV definition ( see Appendix C ) and/or ejection fraction &lt; 45 % , echocardiogram , cardiac MRI . A known history sustain ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) , ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) , Torsade de Pointes , cardiac arrest unless currently address automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( AICD ) . Hypertrophic cardiomegaly restrictive cardiomyopathy prior treatment cause . Uncontrolled hypertension , i.e. , blood pressure ( BP ) ≥170/95 ; patient history hypertension control medication must stable dose ( least one month ) meet inclusion criterion . Any cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic medication ( exclude stable dos betablockers ) Patients take drug cause significant QTc/QTf prolongation unless able switched nonQTc/QTf prolong medication stable dose without significant QT prolongation ( &gt; 470 msec ) . Concomitant use significant CYP3A4 inhibitor unless able switched nonCYP3A4 inhibit medication . Caution use administer study drug patient take medication significantly metabolize enzyme refer ( http : //medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/clinicaltable/ ) clinically relevant medication . Particular attention pay patient receive warfarin . Patient coagulation parameter monitor regularly , warfarin dose adjust accordingly . If drug discontinue replace , enrollment may allow discussion MSK PI .</criteria>
