	<brief_summary>The primary aim study evaluate impact hippocampal-sparing prophylactic cranial irradiation ( HS-PCI ) survival status patient nodal-positive ( locally advance ) adenocarcinoma compare overall survival rate patient undergoing HS-PCI patient without intervention . In addition , study aim investigate whether HS-PCI detrimental neurocognitive function evaluate impact patient 's quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients locally advance non-small cell lung cancer ( LA-NSCLC ) increase risk develop central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases course disease . The brain common site failure first-line therapy ( independent combine sequential consolidation chemotherapy ) . Recent study employ multimodal therapy report overall brain metastasis rate range 22 % 55 % , rate brain first site relapse range 16 % 43 % . Prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) result 2-3 fold low incidence brain metastasis . However , randomized study fail demonstrate improve overall survival ( OS ) PCI . One major weakness trial unselected mixed pool stage III patient ( stage III A B , lymph node status N0 N2 , squamous non-squamous histology etc. ) . A broad variety study show certain subset patient NSCLC ( e.g . cancer adenocarcinoma histology , multilevel nodal involvement ) high risk brain metastasis . Furthermore , risk brain metastasis appear specifically high young patient ( age &lt; 60 year ) , although collective commonly undergo frequently chemotherapy and/or aggressive regimen elderly patient . Prevention CNS metastasis , even LA-NSCLC patient sit failure , improve quality life , patient control extracranially , improve survival . Meta analyse perform data several Radiation Treatment Oncology Group ( RTOG ) study show longer survival patient LA-NSCLC treat either radiation alone radiochemotherapy associate increased incidence CNS metastases . Although addition chemotherapy radiation therapy reduce extracranial distant metastasis improve survival alter brain relapse rate . Even though addition modern target therapy use small-molecules antibody may improve outcome , CNS remain common site failure target therapy , although evidence resistance histological workups metastasis find . This emphasize urgent need treatment direct chemotherapeutically inaccessible ( dormant ) micrometastases priori disperse within brain . As median time relapse CNS approximately 6 month first-line therapy , treatment micrometastases meaningfully initiate even shortly first-line therapy . Irradiation brain bear risk induce acute ( partially mass-associated ) side effect nausea , vomit fatigue , also cause long-term neurocognitive deficit . Although neurocognitive disorder PCI/Whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) also multifactorial etiology base patient 's individual medical history ( precede chemotherapy , pre-existing vascular damage e.g . smoking , local reactions/edema ) , currently believe mostly cause loss neural stem cell hippocampal area . Multipotent self-renewing neural stem cell find subgranular zone adult hippocampus subventricular zone lateral ventricle . The hippocampus play important role memory consolidation emotional learning ( contextual fear conditioning ) . The disruption neurogenesis subgranular zone damage hippocampus lead impair short- long-term memory , learn contextual fear conditioning . In line , irradiate brain decrease neurogenesis hippocampus lead impair hippocampal-dependent learning memory . To prevent radiation-induced loss neuronal stem cell , hippocampus-sparing ( HS ) radiation technique develop efficacy demonstrate recently publish phase II RTOG 0933 study . The trial include patient brain metastasis Karnofsky Performance Scale ( KPS ) 70 % . Following HS-WBRT patient show relative neurocognitive function ( NCF ) decline 7 % four month HS-WBRT , four time less observed study conventional WBRT ( 30 % ; p &lt; 0.001 ) . Since study one-arm study without control , report hippocampal failure rate 4.5 % remain controversially discuss . Multiple study describe hippocampus limbic circuit generally rare site brain metastasis many cancer . NSCLC show specifically low rate hippocampal brain metastasis ( 2.8 % brain metastasis ) risk model reveal slightly increase absolute risk ( +0.2 % ) HS-WBRT . Thus , since treatment NSCLC , efficient prevention BM potential CNS micrometastases currently outweigh associate neurotoxicity lack survival benefit , HS-WBRT may provide possibility tip scale toward prophylactic WBRT , least specific subgroup high risk . Radiation regimens PCI influence pattern CNS failure NSCLC include total dos 20-36 Gy fraction size 2-3 Gy . A fraction size 2 Gy total dose 30 Gy chosen RTOG 0214 study PCI LA-NSCLC . This regimen show decrease CNS metastases 54 % 13 % difference NCF decline PCI versus non-PCI patient 4 year . In addition , although paucity clinical data WBRT dose EQD2 ( equivalent dose 2 Gy fraction ) range 10-20 Gy , dose-response curve provide 'best fit ' model suggest minimal benefit dose 30 Gy ( EQD2 ) .</detailed_description>
