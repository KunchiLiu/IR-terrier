	<brief_title>Intervention Study - Effectiveness Smartphone Delivered Interval Walking Training Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) one common long-term medical condition worldwide . The patient two-fold increased mortality rate compare general population T2D major problem Denmark incidence estimate rise 280.000 today approximately 500.000 people 2020 ( 5 ) . The T2D rehabilitation program Danish municipalities overall purpose introduce help patient healthy lifestyle ( 6 ) . The program conduct period 8-14 week exercise intervention , long-term follow-up . Not much know amount integration PA patient 's everyday life follow intervention ( 7 ) . This major variation across municipality pose problem rehabilitation TD2 , quality rehabilitation depend geographical location T2D patient . Several study show supervised PA advantageous ; patient T2D key metabolic factor ( 6-9 ) improve quality life reduces risk all-cause mortality ( 1,2,6,10,11,12 ) . Due many beneficial effect PA T2D patient , PA important factor prevention treatment T2D ( 13 ) . Long-term PA intervention employ supervise exercise regime ( 14,15 ) effective , also demand expensive . Attempts increase daily physical activity level large scale , free-living `` real life '' , little effect ( 14-16 ) despite well-established patient education program . In general , exercise adherence low dropout rate high group patient . A large number patient T2D experience diminish quality life , decrease physical functioning , diminish exercise tolerance ( 17 ) , numerous patient unmotivated incapable change behaviour prevalence depressive anxiety symptom highly prevalent T2D patient ( 17,18,19 ) . Collectively could pose important barrier engagement exercise reaching recommend level PA ( 20 ) . Karstoft et al ( 2013 ) examine feasibility implement free-living interval walking ( IWT ) continuous walk train program small sample patient T2D . IWT initiate monitored Japanese training device , JD-mate ( 10 ) . The study find remarkable effect physical fitness level , body composition glycaemic control compliance rate 85 % low dropout level ( 9 ) . Based experience Karstoft et al several pilot test 's Danish Diabetes Association ( DF ) , believe IWT approach handle lack PA patient T2D . However JD-mate , expensive ( 3500 kr . ) , Japanese instruction , lack automatic transmission data thus user-friendly large scale . It evident novel low cost , sustainable exercise solution suitable vehicle need , improve quality life increase life expectancy patient . The use Tele-Health intervention ( THI ) potential educate engage patient T2D self-management long-term evidence suggest THI could effective feasible improve clinical outcome diabetes care ( 14,15,22,23 ) . The widespread increasing use smartphone application open new way improve health health care delivery . It might ideal use THI increase physical activity hereby target large part population simple inexpensive mean . The smartphone use tool among others register exercise , diet , weight plasma glucose level , evidence use smartphone exercise device lacking ( 24 ) . In 2010 Danish Centre Strategic Research Type 2 Diabetes ( DD2 ) TrygFondens Centre Aktiv Sundhed ( CFAS ) , Rigshospitalet , Denmark , develop InterWalk Application ( IW app ) smartphone promote IWT large scale . IWT potential increase physical activity large group T2D patient hopefully improve lifestyle patient T2D . However , motivation lifestyle change subjectively drive individually determine ( 25-27 ) . The personal resource close environment key determinant challenge handle everyday life ( 28,29 ) . Motivational factor important change physical activity behaviour patient T2D , knowledge motivation maintain sustainable active lifestyle limit . Studies effectiveness employ smartphones vehicle improve physical activity behaviour everyday life long-term patient T2D therefore need . Aim/purpose - ( Hypothesis ) The primary objective study investigate InterWalk app effective increase moderate-and-vigorous physical activity level compare standard care offer sample T2D patient across 52 week . Secondarily , investigate extend IW app reduce sit time , induce weight loss , improve glycaemic control , increase quality life , improve cardio-respiratory fitness reduce use diabetes medication . The primary hypothesis test hypothesis , replace standard exercise program normal municipal standard care Interval Walking Training deliver IW app , patient become physical active . The secondary explorative hypothesis motivational support increase individual long-term physical activity level everyday patient T2D . Methods Study design The study 52-weeks single-blinded pragmatic randomize controlled trial , participant allocate three arm . Two arm receive IWT without additional support . The control arm receive standard care . The intervention deliver Danish municipality . A detailed description three arm find . The study carry subgroup DD2 cohort .
