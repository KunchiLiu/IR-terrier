	<brief_summary>BRCA1 BRCA2 gene , implicate 10-15 % ovarian cancer case , increase 22 % germline BRCA1/2 mutation frequency patient high grade serous histology subtype , include woman family history breast ovarian cancer . With rapid advancement therapeutic target population , protocol seek provide genetic BRCA1/2 screening patient high grade serous ovarian cancer . This information may help selection future treatment option genetic test BRCA1/2 may use potentially prevent proportion cancer family member . This study opportunity patient improve access genetic molecular test BRCA1/2 mutation could impact future treatment option . Moreover , study allow prospectively assess proportion patient BRCA mutation ovarian cancer describe type mutation identify large population .</brief_summary>
