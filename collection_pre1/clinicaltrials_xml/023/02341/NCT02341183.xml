	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess tolerability effect HS ( hypertonic saline ) deliver tPAD ( transnasal Pulmonary Aerosol Delivery ) device mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/chronic bronchitis ( COPD/CB ) subject . The investigator hypothesize HS delivery via tPAD safe , improve MCC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The beneficial effect inhale HS CF patient ( cystic fibrosis ) well establish . Concerns safety intolerability patient COPD/CB , base part upon experience ultrasonic delivery device , limited interest explore therapeutic option . Although clinical data suggest HS deliver via jet nebulizer generally well tolerated patient COPD/CB , pre-clinical data suggests cell shrinkage , release proinflammatory cytokine ( i.e . IL-8 ) , transient cilium stasis dependent upon rate aerosol delivery . Slow/continuous delivery may avoid most/all detrimental effect promote even great cumulative ASL ( airway surface liquid ) volume increase . To translate data feasible treatment strategy , comfortable , quiet delivery device use long time period ( i.e . overnight ) develop slowly deliver HS via nasal cannula device avoid aerosol rain-out device 's tubing . Use computational model ( MPPD : Multiple-Path Particle Dosimetry V2.0 ) predict device , generate 2 um MMAD aerosol particle , achieve -5-8 % lung deposition . When tune output ~0.033 ml/min , 8 hour use predict deposit minimum 140 mg NaCI onto airway surface . This compare favorably estimate mass deliver via jet nebulizer clinically successful study HS CF ( 110 mg/day , assume 19.75 % deposition fraction Pari LC PLUS ) . The propose study single site , randomize , open label , cross-over trial design measure tolerability effect mucociliary clearance follow 7 % HS deliver via tPAD eight hour overnight COPD/CB subject . Comparison measurement make follow treatment overnight stay . COPD/CB subject meet inclusion exclusion criterion enrol study . All study procedure conduct Clinical Translational Research Center ( CTRC ) UNC Hospitals EPA building Mason Farm Rd UNC Hospitals campus .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects meet follow criterion eligible study participation : 1 . Subjects age 40 80 year ( inclusive ) , body mass index ( BMI ) &lt; 35 kg/m2 2 . Female subject must nonpregnant must either sexually active , postmenopausal , surgically sterilize , agree use appropriate `` doublebarrier '' method ( diaphragm condom ) ; , must currently use prescribe transdermal , injection , implant , oral contraceptive study participation 3 . Subjects baseline state health , determine medical history examination 4 . Subjects normal lung function FEV1 30 % 80 % predict FEV1/FVC &lt; 70 % 5 . Subjects capable provide write informed consent English participate study 6 . Produces sputum two day per week , average . 7 . History smoking cigarettes ≥ 10 pack year . Subjects exclude study accord follow criterion : 1 . Subjects use oxygen continuously require night . 2 . Subjects FEV1 &lt; 30 % &gt; 80 % FEV1/FVC ≥70 % screening . 3 . Subjects chronically require &gt; 10mg per day prednisone ( equivalent corticosteroid dose ) . 4 . Subjects concomitant presence congestive heart failure , active coronary syndrome , disease opinion investigator would increase risk result participation . 5 . Subjects recent change respiratory medication , include new antibiotic systemic corticosteroid intervention within last 4 week . 6 . Subjects history intolerance hypersensitivity hypertonic saline short act inhaled beta agonist . 7 . Subjects significant bronchoreactivity examination PFT testing , opinion investigator , would increase risk HS use . 8 . Subjects radiation exposure within 12 month prior study participation would cause exceed Federal Regulations participate study . 9 . Subjects symptomatically active , chronic acute rhinosinusitis , nasal abnormality could interfere aerosol delivery impact subject safety . 10 . Subjects positive pregnancy test nursing . 11 . Subjects diagnose obstructive sleep apnea . 12 . Subjects , opinion Principal Investigator , participate study .</criteria>
