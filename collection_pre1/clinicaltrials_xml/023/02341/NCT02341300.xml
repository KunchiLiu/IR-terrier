	<brief_summary>Anemia pregnancy define hemoglobin concentration le 11 g/dL first third trimester , less 10.5 g/dL second trimester . The rate anemia variable depend largely preexist iron store supplementation . Estimates World Health Organization report 35 % 75 % pregnant woman develop country 18 % woman industrialized country anemic . Maternal anemia associate increase risk preterm birth , low birthweight , small gestational age infant . Many study show improvement outcome maternal iron supplementation case iron-deficiency anemia . Mounting evidence also indicate maternal iron deficiency pregnancy reduces fetal iron store , perhaps well first year life . Anemia pregnancy also impact maternal morbidity mortality . Viteri report anemic pregnant woman great risk death perinatal period anemia major contributory sole cause death 20-40 % 500,000 maternal death per year . The need iron average close 1000mg typical singleton gestation . This amount considerably exceed iron store woman result iron-deficiency anemia unless supplemental iron take . One problem iron supplement use compliance , secondary adverse effect constipation nausea . Research use cast iron pot decrease incidence iron-deficiency anemia non-pregnant woman promise . These study demonstrate good compliance report adverse effect . The aim study determine provide anemic woman first trim pregnancy cast iron pot decrease incidence anemia later pregnancy . Hypothesis : Cooking cast iron pot increase hematocrit level pregnancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Cast Iron Pots Improve Maternal Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Question : Will addition cast iron pot standard care ( nutrition counseling , food recall , prenatal vitamin , +/- iron vit c ) improve hematocrit pregnant woman anemia ? Study Intervention : To provide cast iron pot pregnant woman anemia randomize intervention group aluminum pot woman control group . Women blind allocation . Women qualify hemoglobin meet nutritionist ( would enrol study ) , perform standardized 24 hour food recall nutrition counsel accord standard care , well perform write informed consent . The 24 hour food recall submit manufacturer ( Nutrition Quest ) calculate baseline iron intake subject . Subjects enrol agree incorporate provide pot cooking ( capacity ) 3x/week . Subjects call 1x/month ask frequency pot use past month well compliance iron vitamin C supplement , prescribe . Subjects also contact postpartum determine satisfaction intervention . Outcome measure : We look hemoglobin level first , second , third trimester well postpartum ( routinely collect labs pregnancy ) . Ferritin add along routine lab approximately 19 week often perform workup anemia . No labs outside routine maternal lab perform .</detailed_description>
