	<brief_summary>Background : Physical restraint bedrails belt still regularly applied German nursing home despite clear evidence show lack effectiveness safety . In cluster-randomized controlled trial , efficacy guideline-based multicomponent intervention show significant reduction physical restraint use without adverse event . The present study aim apply different version original intervention nursing home resident four different region throughout Germany order evaluate effectiveness programme . Methods/Design : Pragmatic cluster-randomized control trial compare two intervention group ( ( 1 ) update original programme ( 2 ) brief version update programme ) control group ( 3 ) receiving print study material ( optimize usual care ) . Intervention ( 1 ) consist information programme nurse , additional training structure support nominate key nurse , provision print study material supportive material . For intervention ( 2 ) nurse ' train optional carry facultatively key nurse receive additional train-the-trainer module . The control group ( 3 ) receives print study material . Overall , 120 nursing home include approximately 10800 resident recruit , randomize one three group follow 12 month . The primary outcome define proportion resident least one physical restraint 12 month . Physical restraint use assess direct observation . Secondary outcome resident ` quality life well safety parameter i.g . fall fall-related fracture . Process cost measure also assess .</brief_summary>
