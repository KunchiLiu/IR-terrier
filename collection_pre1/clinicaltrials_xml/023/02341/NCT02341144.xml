	<brief_title>Percutaneous Rectus Sheath Block Versus Intra-operative Rectus Sheath Block Pediatric Umbilical Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regional anesthesia increasingly utilized provide post-operative analgesia number surgical procedure child . Rectus sheath block local anesthetic infiltration surgical site two common mode provide post-operative analgesia follow umbilical hernia repair . Studies compare two mode show ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block improve immediate pain score reduce use post-operative analgesia pediatric patient undergo umbilical hernia repair . However , study compare pre-incisional ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block post-operative local anesthetic infiltration subcutaneous and/or intradermal injection . The purpose investigator ' study compare efficacy pre-incisional percutaneous rectus sheath block intra-operative rectus sheath block direct visualization prior closure skin provide post-operative analgesia follow umbilical hernia repair child . The investigator propose prospective study pediatric patient undergo elective umbilical hernia repair randomize pre-operatively receive either pre-incisional , ultrasound guide percutaneous rectus sheath block intra-operative rectus sheath block direct visualization prior closure skin . The primary outcome post-operative pain rating base Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale ( WBFPRS ) follow umbilical hernia repair . Additional outcome measure include : operative time , use intravenous/oral opioid and/or non-opioid medication post-operative period , duration analgesia follow surgery base time first rescue analgesic , intra-operative hemodynamic change , post-operative hemodynamic change , incidence side-effects , complication . Patients/patient guardian receive sheet document post-operative WBFPRS score , oral opioid non-opioid medication administration discharge home total 5 day .</detailed_description>
