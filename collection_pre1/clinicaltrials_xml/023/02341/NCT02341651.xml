	<brief_summary>High blood pressure ( BP ) lead attributable risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . In rural South Asia , hypertension remain significant public health issue sub-optimal rate case find management . A trial investigate integrate primary care strategy control hypertension plan . Packaged intervention plan full-scale study vary combination 1 ) home health education ( HHE ) train community health worker ( CHW ) , 2 ) train government primary health centre mid-level provider ( MLP ) lead care 3 ) train private practitioner . The goal full-scale study test combination intervention effective lower blood pressure among adults hypertension rural community . In addition , full-scale study aim quantify incremental cost- effectiveness approach term cost per project cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) disability adjust life-years ( DALYs ) avert .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Control Blood Pressure Risk Attenuation-rural Bangladesh , Pakistan , Sri Lanka , Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale conduct feasibility study 3 propose South Asian country strong . The South Asian country unique stage epidemiological transition double burden communicable NCDs , latter increase rapidly . ( 2 ) These country also share cultural habit social structure extend family system , largely similar population characteristic health seek behaviour . ( 10 ) Moreover , rural health system South Asian country rely cadre community health worker . At time difference . Bangladesh Pakistan high proportion people live extreme poverty ( purchase power parity &lt; US $ 1.25/day , 49.6 % 22.6 % , respectively ) compare Sri Lanka ( 14 % ) relatively well development indicator term life expectancy literacy rate ( World Bank 2010 ) . However age-standardized death rate non-communicable disease ( NCDs ) uniformly high 3 country . The feasibility allow direct comparison population ( individual ) health system characteristic among country relevant hypertension care . Thus , data feasibility inform future design trial . In order optimize trial design full study , mixed-methods feasibility study quasi-experimental pre- post- evaluation `` triple approach '' 3 component intervention , survey pharmacy , focus group discussion individual in-depth interview well inform strategy full-scale trial rural setting Bangladesh , Pakistan , Sri Lanka .</detailed_description>
