	<brief_title>Utility Fallopian Tube Cocultures Assisted Reproductive Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The surgical technique involve laparoscopic brush tissue biopsy fallopian tube lumen . A small piece fallopian tube line remove surgery.The biopsy minimally invasive relatively pain free procedure . Co culture blood serum drawn least one day prior biopsy IVF cycle . The fallopian tube sample send Center Reproductive Medicine ( CRM ) lab treat , purified frozen . The next month whenever physician deems appropriate , patient undergo typical IVF cycle give standard medication protocol determine physician stimulate egg growth ovary . The patient 's egg retrieve mixed sperm . At time , lab begin thaw grow fallopian tube cell . Once fertilization confirm , patient 's embryo place top ( thaw ) fallopian tube cell allow grow . Subsequently , embryo place top uterus implantation pregnancy .</detailed_description>
