	<detailed_description>The prevalence food allergy increase pediatric population.1 A diagnosis food allergy carry significant medical , nutritional , psychological implication patient families.2-4 Therefore , make accurate diagnosis critical . However , diagnosis symptomatic food allergy continue challenge allergist practice physician . The patient 's clinical history remain key component diagnose food allergy . Skin prick test food-specific IgE test act secondary tool aid evaluation process , test also suffer high rate false positivity . 5 For specific IgE level cutoff food , however , supervise oral food challenge ( OFCs ) may necessary establish diagnosis symptomatic food allergy , sensitivity value relatively low . Currently , double-blind , placebo-controlled food challenge ( DBPCFC ) remain gold standard diagnosis food allergy.9 OFCs inherent drawback : always readily available patient , time-consuming , potentially dangerous due risk anaphylaxis . Wheat one eight allergenic food responsible approximately 90 % food allergy . Wheat le allergenic food group less likely cause multi-organ , severe , life-threatening reactions.10 Allergy wheat prevalent child adult consider transient allergy infancy/childhood . Wheat allergy often outgrow early childhood , case age 3-5 years,11 35 % show persistent allergy adolescence.12 While previous study use food-specific IgE antibody determine diagnostic decision point indicate high likelihood clinical reactivity certain food , namely milk , egg , peanut , fish,6-8 wheat-specific IgE level seem useful predictor food challenge outcome , enable reduction need food challenge . Furthermore , false-positive IgE reaction wheat cereal frequently see grass-allergic patient due insignificant cross-reactivity water/salt-soluble proteins.13,14 Therefore , identification wheat protein associate symptom wheat importance . Gliadins particular implicate allergy wheat , IgE-mediated allergy non-IgE mediate celiac allergy . IgE antibodies ω-5-gliadin find child immediate reaction ingest wheat , publish result show increased level IgE ω-5-gliadin correlate outcome food challenge . In Finnish study , child IgE antibodies ω-5-gliadin react immediate symptom wheat challenge , patient delay negative challenge test result show detectable IgE antibody ω-5-gliadin.15 In Japanese cohort , presence elevate ω-5-gliadin-specific IgE antibody associate immediate symptom wheat food challenge also patient strong convincing history wheat allergy challenge due risk anaphylaxis . Furthermore , patient severe reaction upon challenge significantly high level ω-5-gliadin-specific IgE antibody compare child mild moderate symptoms.16 In multicenter Japanese study , Ebisawa et al . show significant relationship probability wheat allergy concentration ω-5-gliadin-specific IgE antibodies 2.6-fold increased risk.17 In study mixed German American subject , ω-5-gliadin-specific IgE antibody correlate food challenge outcomes patient suspect allergy . However , sample size study much small others , German population include patient non-IgE mediated wheat allergy delayed symptom , almost half German cohort.18 Nonetheless , ω-5-gliadin-specific IgE antibody may differ among population Asia , Europe , United States due dietary habit genetics , study warrant , especially large U.S. cohort . Food crop develop agricultural biotechnology commercial use thoroughly assess safety . One key element safety assessment genetically improve crop evaluation potential change allergenic property . Allergenic property crop potentially alter know allergen protein high potential become allergen introduce . In addition , level expression endogenous allergen might alter result transformation insertion new gene plant genome.19 Since wheat know allergenic food crop , international guideline require analysis determine introduction gene production recombinant proteins wheat cause unintended change level endogenous allergenic protein . To address question , level wheat-specific IgE binding observe biotechnology derive wheat variety compare set bind value observe reference wheat variety already market . Determining level direct IgE binding use enzyme link immuno-sorbent assay ( ELISA ) show appropriate method perform comparisons,20 especially assay validate calibrated prior production data.21 This comparison important enable determination whether heterogeneity wheat-allergic patient wheat allergy term predominant trigger . Ultimately , crop may engineer eliminate culprit component predominant . Food challenge outcomes standard ImmunoCAP IgE assay wheat compare CRD wheat test study ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . When evaluate together clinical history , skin test reactivity , OFC outcomes , response individual component may able use predict food challenge responsiveness . With respect intact wheat-specific IgE level , two previous study use , true 95 % positive predictive value cutoff predict reactivity OFC could determine wheat , although physician challenge suggest estimated wheat level 26 kU/L determine possible reactivity.6,7 However , study decade old pre-dated component resolve diagnostics ( CRD ) . CRD major protein ω-5-gliadin may prove beneficial determine predictive level IgE positive OFC outcomes wheat . Therefore , addition determine wheat component pattern could predict OFC outcome , hope determine 95 % predictive decision point individual component compare decision point estimate ImmunoCAP assay wheat .</detailed_description>
