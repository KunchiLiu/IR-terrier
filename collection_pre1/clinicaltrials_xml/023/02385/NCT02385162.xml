	<detailed_description>Glycogen storage disease ( GSDs ) group inherit genetic disorder cause glycogen improperly store body . People glycogen storage disease buildup abnormal amount type glycogen tissue . The main type glycogen storage diseases categorized number name . They include : People GSD I may episodes low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) , usually period fast , due ability store glycogen inability properly release . People GSD I typically develop enlarge liver ( hepatomegaly ) storage glycogen . Elevations liver function enzyme , blood fat cholesterol level , lactic acid , uric acid also occur . Additional feature GSD I include decreased bone density , poor growth , kidney disease , liver adenomas , delay puberty . Treatment primarily consist dietary management maintain normal blood glucose level prevent hypoglycemia . GSD I divide subtypes . GSD Type Ia cause deficiency glucose-6-phosphatase ( G6Pase ) primarily liver , GSD Type Ib cause deficiency glucose-6-phosphate translocase . Many symptom similar , especially early life . However , people Type Ib prone infection give weak immune system . GSD I cause non-working change either G6PC gene SLC37A4 gene , cause deficiency particular enzyme . GSD I follow autosomal recessive inheritance . Glycogen Storage Disease Type II [ also know Pompe disease , Acid Maltase Deficiency , Glycogenosis Type II , Acid alpha-Glucosidase Deficiency , Lysosomal alpha-Glucosidase Deficiency ] Pompe disease inherit often fatal disorder cause deficiency acid alpha-glucosidase ( GAA ) , enzyme need breakdown glycogen ( sugar store energy ) specialize structure body , call lysosome . Patients Pompe disease little GAA enzyme activity breakdown glycogen . The excess glycogen accumulates store heart , skeletal muscle tissue , cause progressive symptom Pompe disease.Glycogen Storage Disease Type III [ also know Cori disease , Forbes disease , Debrancher enzyme deficiency , Limit Dextrinosis ]</detailed_description>
