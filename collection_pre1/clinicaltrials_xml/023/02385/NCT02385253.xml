	<brief_title>Training Primary Care Physicians Perform Melanoma Opportunistic Surveillance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cutaneous melanoma consider potentially curable disease detect early . Primary care physician ( PCPs ) well position detect early melanoma perform opportunistic melanoma surveillance at-risk population physical examination . Opportunistic surveillance mean physician performance visual inspection skin expose physical examination focus presenting condition . Opportunistic surveillance require skill visual inspection skin magnification skin hand-held device , dermoscope . ( This research aim 1 ) develop easily disseminate , interactive melanoma early detection skill train program PCPs 2 ) examine clinical proficiency PCPs regard pigmented lesion . The knowledge gain PCPs essential development successful introduction method physician learn perform opportunistic surveillance melanoma . By evaluate mean encourage facilitate opportunistic surveillance melanoma , educational program may eventually bring widespread use training PCPs . In addition Pre-training Test Post-training Test , phase educational training program describe : 1 . Knowledge Acquisition The Knowledge Acquisition phase deliver via personal computer/tablet . It take one hour complete . The one-hour course consist case history videos follow present : 1 ) threshold rule visual inspection , 2 ) benefit magnification dermoscopy assist diagnosis , 3 ) demonstration 3-point checklist dermoscopy . 2 . Skills Assessment The Skills Assessment phase deliver via smartphone . The program may intermittently access take two week complete . The PCP ask review make simulated management decision 20 case vignette clinical image body surface dermoscopy individual lesion . Clinical practice simulate requirement make decision refer dermatology decision referral need . If biopsy perform case vignette , pathology report provide , PCP ask next step patient 's care . Performance feedback provide . 3 . Deliberate Practice The Deliberate Practice phase deliver via smartphone . It take 1-8 week complete . The PCP ask review additional case visual inspection dermoscopy improve aspect performance demonstrate weakness . Individual strengths weakness assess , personalize feedback provide . After achieve competency simulate case , research staff provide PCP DermScope device ( smartphone fit dermoscope ) use next phase . 4 . Clinical Proficiency The Clinical Proficiency phase take place clinical practice PCP course 1-8 week . The PCP ask use DermScope capture transmit least 12 lesion . Informed consent obtain patient prior obtain non-identifying image . During image capture , photograph mark DermScope program date , time , clinical assessment form ( CAF ) . The image transmit teleconsultant ( PI ) , assign unique identification number image data . The PI render opinion within 72 hour regard need refer patient dermatology reassure patient . The PCP ask make decision regard management patient communicate decision need patient .</detailed_description>
