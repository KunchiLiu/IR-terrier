Silver diamine fluoride ( SDF ) safe , cost-effective caries-arresting agent appear conform World Health Organization 's Millennium Goals . SDF commercially available 38 % 12 % , topically use yearly half-yearly arrest ECC . The SDF regimen use ECC treatment lack evidence base . Therefore necessary find suitable SDF concentration application interval arrest ECC . The purpose randomise control trial compare efficacy two commercially available SDF solution pre-prepared concentration 38 % 12 % apply yearly half-yearly interval 36 month arrest caries primary teeth . Methods / Design : This double-blinded study recruit 888 kindergarten child age 3-4 year caries . The sample size sufficient appropriate statistical analysis . The child classify high low caries rate equally allocate four group caries treatment : Group A - semi-annual application 12 % SDF ; Group B - annual application 12 % SDF ; Group C - semi-annual application 38 % SDF ; Group D - annual application 38 % SDF . The child follow 36 month kindergarten enter primary school . Clinical examination 6-month interval conduct ass whether caries arrest . Information confound factor , oral hygiene habit use fluoride agent , collect parental questionnaire baseline follow-up . Discussion : This study help determine suitable SDF concentration application interval arrest caries child . Because SDF use caries arrest painless , simple , low-cost , widely recommend promoted caries control young child difficulty access afford conventional dental care . The applicability finding impact public health would immense .</brief_summary>
