	<criteria>Participants measurable stage IIIB , IIIC , IV melanoma clinical radiological evidence disease . These participant may cutaneous , uveal , mucosal primary melanoma , unknown primary melanoma . The diagnosis stage IIIBIV melanoma must confirm cytological histological examination . Staging cutaneous melanoma base revise AJCC stag system . Participants must eligible treat ipilimumab base clinician judgment within standard care . Participants require radiological study define radiologically evident disease . Required study include : Chest CT scan , Abdominal pelvic CT scan , Head CT scan MRI PET/CT fusion scan may replace scan chest , abdomen , pelvis . Participants metastatic melanoma available biopsy pretreatment day 22 must consent biopsy . Metastases may nod , skin , soft tissue , liver , site access core needle biopsy , incisional excisional biopsy , without image guidance . The lesion ( ) must large enough enable biopsy least 0.1 cm3 tumor tissue ( ideally 0.3 cm3 ) 5 core biopsy ( ideally 1416 gauge , 18 gauge acceptable ) incisional/excisional biopsy time point . Biopsies may take single lesion multiple lesion time point depend size lesion . Different lesion may sample time point . It acceptable perform biopsy pretreatment , perform excision day 22 , even general anesthesia need . The lesion biopsied must specify study enrollment include target lesion RECIST calculation . There must measurable disease addition lesion ( ) biopsied . Up 15 participant whose metastasis available biopsy may enrol first stage enrollment , 17 participant whose metastasis available biopsy may enrol second stage enrollment . Participants brain metastasis eligible follow true : The total number brain metastasis ever ≤ 3 , Each brain metastasis must completely remove surgery , unresected brain metastasis must treat stereotactic radiosurgery . There evident growth brain metastasis since recent treatment . No brain metastasis &gt; 2 cm diameter time registration . The recent surgical resection gammaknife therapy malignant melanoma must complete ≥ 1 week prior registration . ECOG performance status 0 1 Ability willingness give inform consent Laboratory parameter follow : ANC ≥ 1000/mm3 Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 Hgb ≥ 9 g/dL HgbA1C ≤ 7.5 % AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( except patient Gilbert 's disease , bilirubin 4x ULN allow ) . Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Age 18 year old registration . Participants must least two intact ( undissected ) axillary and/or inguinal lymph node basins Participants receive follow medication treatment time within 4 week registration : Chemotherapy Interferon ( e.g . IntronA® ) Radiation therapy ( Stereotactic radiotherapy , gamma knife , use ≥ 1 week prior registration ) Allergy desensitization injection High dos systemic corticosteroid , follow qualification exception : Daily dose 10 mg predisone ( equivalent ) per day administer parenterally orally allow patient normal adrenal pituitary function . In patient adrenal pituitary insufficiency replacement steroid dose allow . Inhaled steroid ( e.g . : Advair® , Flovent® , Azmacort® ) permit low dos ( less 500 mcg fluticasone per day , equivalent ) . Topical nasal corticosteroid acceptable . Growth factor ( e.g . Procrit® , Aranesp® , Neulasta® ) Interleukins ( e.g . Proleukin® ) Any investigational medication Targeted therapy specific mutate BRAF MEK HIV positivity evidence active Hepatitis C virus ( test do within 6 month study entry ) . Participants currently receive nitrosoureas receive therapy within precede 6 week Participants currently receive checkpoint molecule blockade therapy , receive therapy within precede 6 week . Participants may previously treat CTLA4 block antibody . Participants know suspected allergy component vaccine . Participants may vaccinate previously synthetic peptide include protocol . Participants receive vaccination contain agent synthetic peptide include protocol recur administration vaccine eligible enroll 12 week follow last vaccination . Pregnancy . Female participant childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ( urinary serum betaHCG ) obtain within 2 week prior registration . Males female must agree , consent form , use effective birth control method course vaccination . This consistent existing standard practice vaccine chemotherapy protocol . Female participant must breastfeed Participants medical contraindication potential problem complying requirement protocol opinion investigator . Participants classify accord New York Heart Association classification Class III IV heart disease . Participants uncontrolled diabetes , define HGBA1C &gt; 7.5 % . Participants must prior autoimmune disorder require cytotoxic immunosuppressive therapy , autoimmune disorder visceral involvement . Participants active autoimmune disorder require therapy also exclude . The following exclusionary : The presence laboratory evidence autoimmune disease ( e.g . positive ANA titer ) without symptom Clinical evidence vitiligo Other form depigmenting illness Mild arthritis require NSAID medication A history immunerelated adverse event immune therapy , resolve completely . Participants another cancer diagnosis , except follow diagnosis allow : squamous cell cancer skin without know metastasis basal cell cancer skin without know metastasis carcinoma situ breast ( DCIS LCIS ) carcinoma situ cervix cancer without distant metastasis treat successfully , without evidence recurrence metastasis 5 year Participants know addiction alcohol drug actively take agent , participant recent ( within 1 year ) ongoing illicit IV drug use . Body weight &lt; 110 pound registration , due amount frequency blood drawn .</criteria>
