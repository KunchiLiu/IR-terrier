	<detailed_description>Although potential negative impact head neck cancer ( HNC ) treatment eat ability quality life well document evidence base standardized rehabilitation program available Danish patient affect HNC go radiotherapy ( without concurrent chemotherapy ) . This study proposal base thorough literature review HNC treatment late effect , intervention target dysphagia physical functioning . Traditionally , rehabilitation initiate loss function already establish . Emerging evidence suggests , however , benefit patient initiate early rehabilitation process ( prehabilitation ) start initiation treatment treatment . Prehabilitation aim enhance pre-treatment functional capacity well tolerance treatment , facilitate general recovery , prevent development functional impairment reduce extent problem long-term perspective . HNC patient unique set functional challenge pre- post-treatment dysphagia , pain , weight loss often also high baseline level alcohol tobacco consumption . In addition , study show 31 % 9 % HNC patient meet public health guideline physical activity diagnosis , respectively , weight loss HNC patient treat chemoradiation begin 1 week therapy . Most weight loss lean body mass ( LBM ) rather fat loss . Loss LBM significantly associate physical performance increase functional dependence . The level physical activity typically decrease significantly treatment . Dysphagia consider prominent complication HNC treatment , affect physical function quality life . Post treatment dysphagia occur significant proportion patient result multiple factor xerostomia , taste loss , decrease sensory function , fibrosis trismus . Disuse swallow muscle due acute radiation effect tube feed contribute decline swallow function . Often , difficulty swallow mouth open present feature HNC even time diagnosis . To reduce problem , patient may series exercise treatment promote strength , mobility , endurance base tongue , pharyngeal constrictor , suprahyoid strap muscle . Although definitive trial yet carry , small randomize controlled trial ( RCTs ) observational study investigate pre-treatment swallow and/or mouth open exercise program show promising benefit . Further , study resistance cardio training functional capacity HNC patient generally promise medium large effect fatigue physical function measure . For weight loss seem progressive resistance training ( PRT ) able almost reverse loss LBM HNC patient . Generally study swallow therapy HNC patient rely greatly self-practice , thus report low compliance . In view knowledge investigator determine need study include patient HNC undergoing ( chemo ) radiation therapy focus ) prevention dysphagia loss muscle strength ii ) improvement compliance mouth open swallow exercise . The purpose SYNK study randomize design test effect theory base intervention eat dysfunction secondary radiation treatment HNC . The SYNK intervention consist : ) individual instruction swallow mouth opening exercise 3 day per week occupational therapist throughout radiotherapy , ii ) progressive resistance training twice weekly physiotherapist , either individually group base , throughout radiotherapy , iii ) daily home-based swallow mouth opening exercise begin treatment 2 month end-of-treatment ( self-practice ) , iv ) weekly follow-up phone contact occupational therapist end-of-treatment 2 month onwards . The investigator enroll patient Oncological Department Rigshospitalet randomize 240 patient . Patients randomize ( 1:1 ) standard care plus SYNK intervention standard care ( control group ) . The propose study potential support general health status HNC patient well minimize adverse late effect treatment ( i.e . swallow mouth opening difficulty , general physical deterioration due physical inactivity problem eat , reduce QoL ) . The design intervention , early , intensive bimodal add new dimension research prevention devastate late effect particularly vulnerable patient group . The investigator hypothesize SYNK intervention : - Improve swallow function - Improve physical function stop loss muscle strength - Improve quality life lessen symptom anxiety depression</detailed_description>
