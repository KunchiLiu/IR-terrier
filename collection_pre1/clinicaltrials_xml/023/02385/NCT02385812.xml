	<brief_title>Screening Alberta Asbestos Exposed Workers Lung Cancer Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Canada , lung cancer primary cause cancer mortality next three culprit combine ( breast , colon prostate cancer ) . Cigarette smoke important risk factor development lung cancer . Another population particular interest Alberta involve worker occupational exposure asbestos asbestos tobacco exposure result synergistic effect lung cancer risk . Mesothelioma rare cancer line lung poor prognosis 80 % case believe related asbestos exposure . Unfortunately , despite advance treatment , little impact overall survival lung cancer mesothelioma past 20 year great part patient usually present disease advance incurable stage . Additional strategy desperately need reduce morbidity mortality associate disease . The objective study develop implement LDCT screening approach lung cancer mesothelioma asbestos-exposed worker Alberta ; determine participant ' motivation expectation associate screen program , satisfaction program , psychosocial consequence screen program ; determine accuracy lung cancer risk prediction model modify include asbestos exposure ; determine 3-year clinical incidence lung cancer asbestos-exposed individual interested lung cancer screen meet minimal risk threshold . The investigator offer combine lung cancer mesothelioma screen program 200 Alberta asbestos-exposed worker base low-dose CT scanning .</detailed_description>
