	<detailed_description>Study subject identify pool candidate SCS therapy affiliate , refer , clinical site . Subjects participate investigational plan include entry criterion evaluation , Baseline assessment , trial stimulation phase , post-trial assessment . Subjects successful Trial Phase receive permanent implant Implantable Pulse Generator ( IPG ) lead , undergo 12 month stimulation delivery assessments 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month Post-Permanent Device Activation . Subjects sign inform consent undergo evaluation determine eligibility study base inclusion exclusion criterion . Baseline assessment also include measure pain , disability , functioning , medication use , quality life , depression sleep . Implantation use Senza System follow Nevro Physician 's Manual supporting Manuals . Subjects undergo Trial Phase last 14 day determine his/her response SCS therapy . Following Trial Phase external device stimulation , subject assess pain , successful Trial Phase eligible proceed permanent implantation SCS system . Following permanent device implant , IPG `` activate '' thus , stimulation deliver ongoing basis 12 month . At 1 month 9 month follow Post-Permanent Device Activation , assessment pain adverse event make . At 3 , 6 , 12 month Post-Permanent Device Activation , subject assess pain adverse event well disability , functioning , medication use , quality life , depression sleep . Patient Global Impression Change , Clinician Global Impression Change subject satisfaction record 3 12 month Post-Permanent Device Activation .</detailed_description>
