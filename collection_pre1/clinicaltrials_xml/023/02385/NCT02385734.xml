	<brief_title>Concentrated Growth Factor Treatment Gingival Recessions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The gingival recession successfully treat several periodontal plastic surgery procedure . Among different type procedure use , Coronally Advanced Flap ( CAF ) frequent approach , combine connective tissue graft accept gold standard therapy . Recently , investigator report use CGF reconstruction bone defect . They conclude bone formation significantly increase use CGF It use accelerate new bone formation associate guide bone regeneration sinus augmentation.They state CGF may better regenerative capacity high versatility . Therefore , study hypothesize CGFs ' placement together CAF may enhance heal soft tissue . Therefore , aim study determine clinical effect CGF combination CAF compare CAF alone treatment adjacent multiple gingival recession . The patient randomize , split mouth control clinical trial study protocol select individual refer Department Periodontology , Faculty Dentistry , Bülent Ecevit University , either dentin hypersensitivity aesthetic complaint April 2013 April 2014 . All subject receive oral hygiene instruction full-mouth scaling perform 1 month surgery . They instruct perform non-traumatic brushing technique ( Roll ) use ultra soft toothbrush . In twenty subject ( mean age 37.10 ±1.03 , 20-45years , 13 female , 7 male ) , one side jaw receive CAF ( control site ) ( 59 defect ) , opposite site receive CAF+CGF ( test site ) ( 60 defect ) . Full-mouth Plaque index Gingival index evaluate surgery . Custom acrylic guide fabricate measure clinical parameter mid-buccal aspect treat teeth.Probing depth ( PD ) , Clinical Attachment Loss ( CAL ) , Recession Depth ( RD ) , Keratinized Gingiva Width ( KGW ) record mid-buccal aspect treat teeth . Gingival Thickness ( GT ) evaluate mid-facially , 2mm apical gingival margin attach gingiva alveolar mucosa , use 20 endodontic reamer attach rubber stopper local anesthesia . After carefully remove reamer , GT measure digital caliper 0.05 resolution PD , CAL , RD , KGW GT assess baseline 6th month . Complete root coverage ( CRC ) Percentage Root Coverage ( PRC ) calculate 6th month . Intravenous blood collect place two different 10mL glass-coated plastic tube without anticoagulant solution . These tube immediately centrifuge CGF centrifuge machine . The CGF clot remove tube separate Red Blood Cell use microsurgical scissors . The CGF squeeze special box produce membrane constant thickness 1mm.CGF membrane immediately place recession area . All surgery perform expert periodontist single surgical session Gingival recession site randomly determine either test control site toss coin immediately surgical procedure . Sutures remove 10 day plaque control maintain CHX additional 2 week . The patient start brush tooth end 3rd week instruct mechanical tooth cleaning treat tooth use ultra soft toothbrush roll technique . Oral hygiene instruction provide postoperative visit .</detailed_description>
