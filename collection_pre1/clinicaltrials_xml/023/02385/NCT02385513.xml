	<brief_title>PCV10 Immunogenicity Study Nepal 2015</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Streptococcus pneumoniae predominant cause bacterial pneumonia , meningitis septicaemia child worldwide , disproportionately affect child develop country . Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCVs ) reduce pneumococcal disease burden direct protection reduce nasopharyngeal carriage , thereby prevent transmission induce herd protection . In Nepal , invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD ) responsible substantial disease burden child . Surveillance conduct since 2005 Patan Hospital , Kathmandu indicate majority IPD due serotypes 1 , 5 14 , great proportion occur late infancy toddlerhood.7 Vaccine introduction begin January 2015 PCV10 . GAVI fund impact assessment programme ( include IPD , pneumonia , NP colonization health economics ) , underway . A randomised control trial conduct investigator Patan Hospital collaboration Oxford Vaccine Group , use 10-valent PCV , demonstrate two-dose prime ( 6 14 week ) 9-month booster non-inferior immunogenicity 18 week 10 month superior immunogenicity early childhood ( 2-4 year age ) compare conventional three-dose priming schedule ( 6 , 10 , 14 week ) . This two-dose prime boost schedule , 8 week interval priming dos , adopt acceptable schedule World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend late 2014 Nepal Ministry Health result study . However WHO also recommend introduction single inactivate poliomyelitis virus vaccine 14-weeks age order mitigate risk outbreak vaccine derive serotype 2 poliomyelitis virus , protect serotype 2 poliomyelitis virus country switch bivalent OPV trivalent OPV , enhance immunogenicity poliomyelitis vaccine serotypes 1 3 . This create programmatic dilemma concern around vaccine coverage result require three injection 14-week visit . Thus Nepalese Ministry Health , base concern around public acceptance feasibility decide move second PCV10 prim dose 14 week 10 week age . Given decision essential evaluate immunogenicity intend schedule , compare schedule show provide level immunogenicity would predict substantial program impact disease colonisation . This importance increase give Nepal PCV10 impact study currently underway limited data two-dose priming schedule one-month interval priming dos setting show reduction immunogenicity . Therefore study undertaken order evaluate immunogenicity 10-valent PCV prim 6 10 week implement Nepal Ministry Health , compare prim 6 14 week age healthy Nepali infant . In group PCV10 booster give 9 month age . Nepal Nepal low-income country South Asia population 25.8 million people estimate 5 year mortality 54/1000 live birth . Access health care vary considerably within country , 18 % child 5 year pneumonia take health care facility . The capital city , Kathmandu , reside large valley , 2011 total population 1,744,240 people , approximately 10 % child 5 year age . The majority child Nepal receive immunisation local government outpatient clinic . The national EPI schedule follow Nepal currently include Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) birth , diphtheria , tetanus , whole cell pertussis , hepatitis B , Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) oral Polio ( OPV ) vaccines 6 , 10 14 week age , IPV 14 week age , measles rubella vaccine 9 month age , Japanese Encephalitis ( JE ) vaccine 12-23 month age ( endemic region ; Kathmandu one region ) tetanus toxoid pregnancy . Vaccine coverage high Nepal 90 % infant receive DTP , 14 week age past 3 year . PCV10 vaccine 6 10 week booster 9 month age initiate new birth cohort ( i.e . catch program institute ) January 2015 roll-out begin west country expect reach whole country late 2015 . The Patan Academy Health Sciences Patan Hospital lead study Nepal . Patan Hospital one two hospital Kathmandu paediatric referral inpatient service base Lalitpur , south City . Over 300 child commence immunisation 'Under 14 clinic ' Patan Hospital paediatric outpatient department month . Pneumococcal Disease Kathmandu On-going surveillance IPD serotypes occur Patan Hospital Kathmandu since 2005 , identify paediatric admission pneumococcus isolate normally sterile body fluid . This programme initially fund PneumoADIP part South Asia Pneumococcal Alliance ( SAPNA ) extensive collection clinical , radiological laboratory data , demonstrate pneumococcus significant cause disease child Kathmandu , currently fund World Health Organisation . Analysis data late 2012 , show predominance non-vaccine serotypes early infancy , follow shift towards vaccine serotypes , particularly serotype 1 , late infancy childhood . The finding serotypes 1 , 5 , 14 frequent disease cause isolates keep data summarize Global Serotype Project demonstrate serotype disease order frequency low-income country 14 , 5 , 1 , 6B , 19F , 23F 6A . The age distribution vaccine type disease reinforces importance initiate vaccine coverage early infancy early boost 9 month may perform maintain coverage early childhood . Immunogenicity PCV10 Kathmandu We previously conduct open-label , parallel group , randomise control trial Patan Hospital , Kathmandu , Nepal June 2010 November 2011 follow-on February October 2013 . In study compare WHO recommend PCV schedule three priming dos early infancy ( 6 , 10 , 14 week ) two-dose prime ( 6 14 week ) boost 9 month age . We demonstrate use ten-valent PCV ( PCV10 ) two-dose prime booster 9 month provide analogous immunogenicity three-dose prime schedule early infancy , improve protection early childhood . Global Polio Eradication Initiative Over last decade oral poliomyelitis vaccine ( OPV ) extremely efficacious prevent wild-type polio disease across world , include Nepal . The OPV use routine vaccine schedule contain three serotypes weaken poliomyelitis virus ( type 1 , 2 3 ) , facilitate eradication wild-type poliomyelitis Nepal . On rare occasion disease may occur result circulate vaccine derive polio virus ( cVDPV ) , particularly serotype 2 . Thus , country Nepal , situation wild-type disease eradicate yet remain rare risk vaccine derive disease outbreak . This lead proposal switch bivalent OPV ( type 1 3 ) , globally . This happen however , unless population protect type 2 disease mean . Furthermore inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine ( IPV ) , administer intramuscular injection , generate immunity use kill strain three poliomyelitis serotypes , thus produce vaccine type disease result emergence cVDPV outbreaks . This lead WHO recommend introduction IPV order interrupt mitigate risk cVDPV type 2 disease , prior phase bivalent OPV cessation OPV-type 2 use . In Nepal single dose IPV 14 week age addition routine schedule trivalent OPV , implement ( September 2014 ) . Nepal first GAVI country introduce IPV , ready participate globally synchronize switch bivalent OPV coordinate WHO 2016 . IPV give 14 week age ; propose PCV10 schedule 6 week , 14 week , 9 month age meant child would receive three injection 14 week age ( IPV , PCV10 dose 3 DTwP-HBV-Hib vaccine ) . The perception health care provider Ministry Health acceptable lead reduce vaccine coverage . Therefore Nepal Ministry Health introduce January 2015 PCV10 schedule 6 week , 10 week , 9 month age . Based locally available IPD data prior immunogenicity study Kathmandu , pneumococcal conjugate vaccination utilise PCV10 two prim dos 6 14 week follow 9-month booster demonstrate WHO prefer schedule comparison three-dose prime schedule . However WHO also recommend introduction single dose IPV 14 week age order eradicate poliomyelitis serotype 2 vaccine strain disease . Local expert anticipate poor uptake vaccine 14 week age due increase number injection one three time-point . The Nepali government thus suggest move 14 week PCV10 prim dose earlier 10 week time-point , however immunogenicity data support decision . Therefore study aim compare immunogenicity give two PCV10 prim dos 6 10 week 6 14 week . In addition study also evaluate adverse event profile follow 14 week age visit two treatment arm .</detailed_description>
