	<brief_title>Improving Resilience With Whole Grain Wheat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study randomize control , double blind , parallel trial . A 4-week run-in period refine wheat ( RW ) product include prior intervention subject . Thereafter , two different treatment evaluate e.g . 12-week intervention whole grain wheat ( WGW ) product ( 98g WGW per day ) 12-week control intervention RW product . Two experimental visit plan two experimental visit plan 12-week intervention period . In first experimental visit investigator determine liver fat abdominal fat distribution magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . In second experimental visit investigator comprehensively phenotype participant include response mixed meal challenge test .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The inclusion subject mildly impaired cardiometabolic risk profile enable detection improvement health WGW consumption . The investigator therefore aim include 50 middle age overweight male postmenopausal female ( 4570yrs BMI 2535 kg/m2 ) mildly elevated level cholesterol ( cholesterol level &gt; 5 mmol/L ) . In case inclusion subject mildly elevate level total cholesterol difficult , normal level total cholesterol ( &lt; 5 mmol/L ) accept , minimum total cholesterol level 4.5 mmol/L .
