	<detailed_description>Latinos fast grow ethnic group US disproportionately impact chronic condition ( e.g. , overweight/obesity , diabetes ) mitigate physical activity . While evidence-based program available improve physical activity , dissemination constrain reliance costly , limited resource . Short message service ( SMS text message ) strong potential intervention medium Latinos , dominant user mobile phone text messaging , include limited literacy computer skill . The investigator propose develop personalized , culturally-congruent interactive SMS program promote adoption maintenance physical activity overweight , underactive Latino adult test comparable efficacy evidence-based telephone-based advise program use successfully Latinos . Grounded Social Cognitive Self-Determination Theories , program include core set self-regulatory skill building , social support , autonomous motivation enhancement , tailored cultural , linguistic literacy appropriateness . Randomized individual level , 376 sedentary , overweight Latinos age 45 year old assign one three arm : SMS-delivered physical activity program , Human-delivered physical activity program , attention-control arm SMS-delivered basic healthful nutrition advice . They receive assign program 12 month , follow 6-month maintenance phase , final assessment 18 month . Analyses determine two physical activity program result equivalent efficacy adoption maintenance clinically meaningful physical activity increase , superiority attention-control arm 12 18 month . The two physical activity intervention also compare equivalency prevention weight gain reduction abdominal adiposity . The investigator explore relative cost program determine program increase physical activity low cost . While health promotion program deliver professional staff may expensive deliver electronically , unclear automate version produce cost-efficient outcome ( i.e. , comparable improvement outcomes significantly reduce cost ) . This study determine SMS equivalent efficacy traditional human-delivery channel increase physical activity prevent weight gain , result cost-efficient program . If achieve , research significantly reduce health disparity associate physical activity Latinos provide efficacious , tailor culturally appropriate program poise widespread dissemination rapid uptake .</detailed_description>
