	<detailed_description>In study , PET image study two structurally related 18F-hydroxyphenethylguanidines , 4- [ 18F ] fluoro-meta-hydroxyphenethylguanidine ( [ 18F ] 4F-MHPG ) 3- [ 18F ] fluoro-para-hydroxyphenethylguanidine ( [ 18F ] 3F-PHPG ) perform . All study perform normal healthy volunteer . PET stand Positron Emission Tomography type image us radioactive tracer . This also call radiotracer compound link radioactive element . Most compounds short-lived , meaning radioactivity break quickly excrete body . In first stage study , dynamic PET image 90 min do [ 18F ] 4F-MHPG ( n = 4 ) [ 18F ] 3F-PHPG ( n = 4 ) . Data study assess radiotracer 's imaging property , pharmacokinetics metabolic breakdown plasma . Application tracer kinetic analysis method kinetics tracer heart plasma study see method provide accurate measurement regional nerve sympathetic nerve density hearts human subject . Results initial study use select lead compound study patient population . In second stage study , whole-body PET imaging study ( n = 4 ) select lead radiotracer perform acquire data necessary generate accurate human radiation absorb dose estimate .</detailed_description>
