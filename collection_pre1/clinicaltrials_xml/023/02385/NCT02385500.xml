	<detailed_description>Study purpose rationale : Patients Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) commonly develop low urinary tract symptom disease severity progress . The frequent symptom nocturia ( night time urinary frequency ) , urinary frequency urgency . ( 1 ) The effect void function levodopa dopamine agonist treatment motor symptoms patient PD clearly understood study conclude conflict result . ( 2 ) Their overactive bladder ( OAB ) symptoms primarily manage antimuscarinics variable efficacy , concern possible heightened central side-effects cognitive motor deterioration patient population . ( 3 , 4 ) Current standard care PD patient low urinary tract symptom require full evaluation history physical exam . This follow microscopic urinalysis , 3-day bladder diary along several questionnaire . According symptom , patient may require non-invasive uroflowmetry assessment post void residual , others undergo full urodynamic study . Management void symptom require initial conservative measure behavioral modification ( reduce caffeinated drink smoke cessation , optimize fluid intake , weight loss ) bladder training . If fails improve symptom , oral pharmacotherapy offer antimuscarinics beta-3 agonist . The purpose protocol compare impact fesoterodine placebo urinary urgency nocturnal sleep problem heterogeneous population PD patient cross-over fashion . Although OAB effectively treat , compel scientifically sound methodological reason use participant study face additional risk serious irreversible harm exposure placebo . Placebo control trial rigorous test treatment efficacy evaluate medical therapy require few subject active control trial . Lastly , anticholinergic study show large placebo effect partially effective treat voiding symptom , justifies use placebo arm . Sample size : This initial pilot study identify effect size fesoterodine treatment urgency episodes patient PD . Subjects randomize group stratify accord age group ( young old 75 years-old ) gender . Power analysis sample size calculation relevant study give exploratory nature . The investigator expect recruit total 60 patient complete cross-over study analysis purpose . This number base similar design study , particularly one Wagg et al . look effect solifenacin oxybutynin old adult mild cognitive impairment ( 6 ) . Many similar study group subject vary 40 77 demonstrate efficacy difference anticholinergics cross-over fashion ( 7-9 ) . Design description methodology : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover , parallel-group study carry outpatient clinic . Subjects assess included study willing participate fit criterion Visit 0 . They randomize group A B undergo baseline evaluation . Both group undergo two-week washout period give placebo . Group A subject start fesoterodine 4 mg day morning two-week washout period . They option escalate 8 mg ( 2 tablet 4 mg ) 4 week fesoterodine . Patients option go back one tablet ( i.e. , 4 mg ) time study . At 10 week ( 2 week washout 8 week study tablet ) , subject assess clinic ( Visit 1 ) . Group B subject start placebo tablet , similar fesoterodine 4 mg , option escalate well . All subject 2-week washout period . After washout period , subject cross opposite arm pattern outcome assessment dose titration maintain . The study conclude 20 week . At end 20 week ( Visit 2 ) , investigator ' subject interview side effect , vital sign examine , adverse reaction event monitor , outcome measure document . Throughout study , subject able drop anytime instruction inform u decision adverse effect . Overall , subject 3 clinical visit enrollment study . Data analysis plan : The comparison 2 arm study , group initially receive fesoterodine one receive placebo , conduct use chi-square analysis . A 2-sample test use compare baseline score 2 group . The Wilcoxon rank-sum test use calculate whether mean difference outcome measure treatment placebo period significant . Differences placebo treatment adjust baseline measure ( available 1-sample sign rank test mean difference equate 0 ) . Any difference analyze change baseline . The primary outcome measure number urgency episode , P value less .05 consider statistically significant . The present statistical analysis secondary measure encompass number formal comparison , thus group-wise type I error could occur . Recruitment procedure : Study investigator send letter colleague ask referral eligible patient interested study . The study investigator may provide refer physician information sheet study give patient . If interested , patient contact investigator . Or , document permission patient ( e.g. , note medical record indicate primary care provider speak patient agreed contact ) , investigaor may allow contact patient enrollment . Clinics maintain separate CHR-approved recruitment protocol ask patient agree ahead time contact research . Investigators contact patient study accord sign consent . The investigator consider recruitment patient PD present clinic urination symptom . They present option agree , assessed inclusion . The investigator blind treatment group . Details confidentiality : All data remain confidential available access investigator . All record identify unique identifier , correspond subject , maintain confidentiality . Records keep one safe lock location , electronic record password protect . The study information keep duration 25 year . As investigator-initiated trial , Pfizer Canada 's role restrict provide medication placebo , well budget require study . They approve current protocol , involve decision-making data analysis . There potential conflict interest . Statement ethical consideration : The study conduct accord ethical principle state Declaration Helsinki ( 2013 ) , ethic approval obtain initiate study-related procedure , consent form take consideration well-being , free-will respect participant , include respect privacy .</detailed_description>
