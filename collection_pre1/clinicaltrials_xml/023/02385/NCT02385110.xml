	<brief_title>Alemtuzumab Combination With Etoposide Dexamethasone Treatment Adult Patients With Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Treatment : If find eligible take part study , receive study treatment 2 part . The first part study last 8 week ( Weeks 1-8 ) call `` induction phase '' . The second part study start induction phase last 16 week ( Weeks 9-16 ) . This part call `` maintenance phase '' . However , part study may longer short depend if/how disease respond treatment , biomarkers react treatment , doctor think best interest . You receive alemtuzumab vein injection skin every day Days 1-4 induction phase 1 time every 4 week maintenance phase . You receive etoposide vein 1 time week induction phase . You receive maintenance phase unless disease stop respond study drug . At point , may begin receive etoposide . The study doctor tell . The length time take infuse study drug different patient patient depend rate injection . Your doctor discus . You receive dexamethasone vein Days 1-7 induction phase . After , take pill dexamethasone every day induction phase . In maintenance phase , take pill 3 time week least day dose ( example , Monday , Wednesday , Friday ) . Your dose study drug may raise , lower , and/or delay doctor think best interest . If disease involve central nervous system , may receive methotrexate . Study Visits : You physical exam follow day : - Day 1 , - Every week first 4 week , - Every 2 week next 4 week , - Every 4 week next 16 week , - Every 8 week . Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test follow day . During first 4 week , test must perform MD Anderson . After , perform local clinic : - Day 1 , - Two ( 2 ) time week first 4 week , - Every week next 4 week , - Every 2 week next 16 week , - Every 4 week . You bone marrow aspiration/biopsy 4 week start study treatment every 4-12 week . At time doctor think need , may additional blood draw bone marrow aspirations/biopsies check status disease . If receive treatment longer 24 week , time procedure may change study doctor think best interest . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Study Visit : If take leave study receive treatment 24 week , follow test procedure perform within 30 day ( +/- 7 day ) last dose study drug : - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate check status disease . If make MD Anderson visit , procedure may do local doctor record forward study doctor . Follow-Up : If respond study drug , follow every 3-6 month 5 year completion treatment . You call ask . Each call last 5-10 minute . This investigational study . Alemtuzumab , etoposide , dexamethasone FDA approve treatment HLH . Etoposide FDA approve commercially available treatment testicular cancer lung cancer . Alemtuzumab FDA approve commercially available treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Dexamethasone steroid use reduce inflammation . The combination alemtuzumab , etoposide , dexamethasone treat HLH investigational . The study doctor explain drug design work . Up 40 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Sign IRBapproved inform consent document . 2 . Patients age include . 3 . â€¢ A documentation diagnosis hemophagocytic lymphocytosis , either newly diagnose relapsed/refractory treat physician PI patient chart . It must note diagnostic criterion establish diagnosis HLH adult patient hitherto poorly identify consider rare disease adult . We see increase number case HLH institution last 2 year partly due referral partly due well understanding disease discussion collaborator Dr Kenneth McClain Dr Carl Allen TCH ( expert pediatric HLH ) . Adult HLH seem occur frequently post malignancy fulminant course pediatric HLH . 4 . Continued No . 3 : The diagnostic criterion traditionally use child ( HLH 1991 HLH 2004 ) may adequately diagnose HLH adult . This first adult HLH protocol country . In absence standard diagnostic guideline patient 's symptom highly suspicious HLH adequate workup rule alternate potential alternate etiology perform treat patient HLH miss diagnosis associate high mortality . These patient discuss PI ( Dr Daver ) prior enrollment case . 5 . Organ function define ( unless due HLH process ) : Serum creatinine &lt; /= 3.0 mg/dL , Total bilirubin &lt; /= 5.0 mg/dL . If organ dysfunction think related HLH process must clearly documented chart patient may enrol study irrespective creatinine bilirubin level . 6 . Women childbearing potential must practice contraception . Females childbearing potential : Recommendation 2 effective contraceptive method study . Adequate form contraception double barrier method ( condom spermicidal jelly foam diaphragm spermicidal jelly foam ) , oral , depo provera , injectable contraceptive , intrauterine device , tubal ligation . Male patient female partner childbearing potential : Recommendation male partner use least 2 effective contraceptive method , describe , prior study entry least 3 month last dose study drug . 7 . Negative urine pregnancy test and/or serum pregnancy test within 7 day initiation therapy . 8 . Male patient female partner childbearing potential : Recommendation male partner use least 2 effective contraceptive method , describe , prior study entry least 3 month last dose study drug . 1 . Pregnant breast feed woman 2 . Any serious/and unstable preexist medical disorder ( aside malignancy exception ) , psychiatric disorder , condition could interfere subject 's safety , obtain informed consent compliance study procedures 3 . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol .</criteria>
