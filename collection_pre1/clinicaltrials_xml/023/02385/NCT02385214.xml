	<brief_summary>Patients primary invasive melanoma recommend undergo excision primary lesion wide margin . There evidence less radical margin excision may safe . This randomise control trial 1 cm versus 2 cm margin excision primary lesion adult patient primary invasive cutaneous melanoma &gt; =1mm thick determine difference rate local recurrence melanoma specific survival . A reduction margin expect improve quality life patient</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MelmarT Melanoma Margins Trial Investigating 1cm v 2cm Wide Excision Margins Primary Cutaneous Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study determine whether difference local recurrence rate melanoma survival rate patient treat either 1cm excision margin 2cm margin intermediate &amp; high risk melanoma . The study design able prove disprove difference risk tumour recur around scar anywhere else body two group patient . This study design show risk long-term pain associate surgery halve . If study show risk tumour recurrence also able determine much impact narrow excision patient term improve quality life reduce side effect surgery melanoma disease . This trial also evaluate determine economic impact narrow excision margin health service society general .</detailed_description>
