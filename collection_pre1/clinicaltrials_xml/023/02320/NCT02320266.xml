	<brief_summary>Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) FDA approve , widely use method treat motor symptom Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , Essential Tremor ( ET ) , Dystonia Obsessive Compulsive disorder ( OCD ) . Over 100,000 patient worldwide implant DBS device . Current approve method locate DBS target region brain use combination stereotactic imaging technique measurement electrical activity brain cell . As part standard clinical technique , electrical data collect individual nerve cell . The target brain region emit unique electrical signal . At certain brain location , DBS surgery , additional electrical data generate response sound collect . Regions brain decrease response repeat sound ( auditory gating ) may important DBS target improve thinking . The aim ( ) DBS surgery , addition EEG , use microelectrodes brain find brain region , along normal path DBS target , auditory gating occurs ( ii ) determine stimulation identify region ( ) alters auditory gate measure EEG . Also additional aim ( iii ) measure electrical activity scalp EEG characterize auditory gate patient DBS surgery also healthy control population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) FDA approve , widely use method treat motor symptom Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , Essential Tremor ( ET ) , Dystonia Obsessive Compulsive disorder ( OCD ) . Over 100,000 patient worldwide implant DBS device . Current approve method locate DBS target region brain ( subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) PD ) use combination stereotactic imaging technique measurement electrical activity brain cell . As part standard clinical technique , electrical data collect individual nerve cell -- procedure call microelectrode recording ( MER ) . The target brain region emit unique electrical signal detect MER standard DBS surgery . MER do stop along way target . At stops DBS surgery , additional electrical data generate response sound collect . Regions brain decrease response repeat sound ( auditory gating ) may important DBS target improve thinking . The aim : ( Aim 1A ) DBS surgery , addition EEG , use microelectrodes brain measure electrical activity single unit activity ( SUA ) local field potential ( LFP ) find brain region along path DBS target auditory gating occur ( Aim 1A ) determine stimulation identify region ( ) alters auditory gate measure EEG ( Aim 1B ) ; ( Aim 2 ) measure electrical activity scalp electroencephalography ( EEG ) characterize auditory gating patient DBS surgery also healthy control population .</detailed_description>
