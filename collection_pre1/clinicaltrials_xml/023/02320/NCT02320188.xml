	<brief_title>Eccentric Exercise Cachexia Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) characterize severe disability metabolic change lead increase cardiovascular mortality compare general population . RA independent cardiovascular risk factor . In contrast general population , RA patient low body mass index ( BMI ) significantly high risk cardiovascular death . Low BMI may indicate rheumatoid cachexia may explain excess cardiovascular risk mortality . Cachexia define loss body cell mass , predominantly skeletal muscle , associate increase fat mass often stable weight . Rheumatoid cachexia , well recognize , frequent , affect two third patient . Pathogenesis may include inflammatory cytokine production , physical inactivity , high catabolism reduce peripheral insulin action . Therapeutic strategy include increase physical activity treatment disease . Studies show regular progressive resistance strength train improves strength pain patient well-controlled RA without exacerbate disease activity joint pain . At comparable mechanical power output , eccentric ( ECC ) exercise characterise low metabolic demand concentric ( CON ) exercise . ECC exercise characterise low energy cost , also specific cardiocirculatory specificity . In patient Parkinson 's disease , compare conventional rehabilitation programme , ECC training well improve quadriceps muscle volume . In overweight diabetic patient , ECC train improved rest energy expenditure fat oxidation , blood lipid profile insulin resistance compare CON training . As cancer , ECC training appear particularly suitable patient rheumatoid cachexia maximize functional structural muscle response low energy cost population . This study aim determine muscle effect ECC training , primary outcome knee extensor strength gain 3 month . Secondary outcome improvement muscle mass , functional status cardiovascular risk . From patient consent ECC train group , muscle biopsy specimens vastus lateralis obtain baseline prior training period . Primary secondary outcome criterion assess inclusion , 3 month , 6 month . In total , 48 patient need recruit . These patient randomly assign one 3 group , group comprise 16 patient : group 1 ECC training , group 2 CONC training , group 3 training ( control ) . The training program consist 30 session 12 week .</detailed_description>
