	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study rituximab yttrium Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan see well work compare rituximab alone treat patient untreated follicular lymphoma . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , may find cancer cell help kill . Radioactive substance link monoclonal antibody bind cancer cell give radiation may help kill cancer cell . It yet know whether rituximab work well without yttrium Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan treat follicular lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab With Without Yttrium Y-90 Ibritumomab Tiuxetan Treating Patients With Untreated Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Test hypothesis single dose Zevalin ( yttrium Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan ) rituximab immunotherapy ( RIT ) increase complete remission ( CR ) rate achieve standard rituximab patient untreated asymptomatic follicular lymphoma ( FL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Test hypothesis Zevalin RIT improve progression-free survival . II . Test hypothesis Zevalin RIT improve time next ( ) therapy time next chemotherapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Study incidence exon 2 B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein ( bcl2 ) mutation patient asymptomatic follicular lymphoma ( AFL ) . II . Measure regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) tissue monocytes on-study FL tumor tissue . III . Measure serum cytokine vitamin D study month 6 . IV . Evaluate beta-2 microglobulin plus lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) score prognostic factor . V. Measure absolute lymphocyte count ( ALC ) , absolute monocyte count ( AMC ) , ALC/AMC ratio study treatment . VI . Compare quality life measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy ( FACT ) -Lymphoma ( Lym ) arm . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . ARM B : Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 8 yttrium Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan 10 minute day 8 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 48 , 60 month every 12 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
