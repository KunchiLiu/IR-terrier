	<brief_title>Treating Peritoneal Carcinomatosis With PIPAC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peritoneal carcinomatosis ( PC ) represent end stage disease many type cancer ( e.g . gastric , pancreatic , liver , colo-rectal , ovarian ) majority patient PC die disease within 6 month . Platinum-based systemic chemotherapy ( SC ) may prolong survival select patient , poor performance status low response rate lead conservative ( nihilistic ) treatment strategy patient . However , patient PC good condition , remain life expectancy month , may still unmet need additional treatment order able perform high quality life long possible . These patient often try several line SC disappointing result , alternative effective treatment strategy desperately need . The installation chemotherapeutic agent within peritoneal cavity would seem simple effective treatment PC - least theoretical point view . Unfortunately , effect intraperitoneal chemotherapy PC disappoint . Like SC , poor response rate may explain poor penetration active chemical substance PC plaque . Combining cytoreductive surgery ( CRS ) intraperitoneal chemotherapy gain interest recent year , approach use highly select patient ( CRS possible ) , procedure carry significant risk complication side effect . Thus , minimally invasive safe delivery relevant chemotherapy concentration may allow work efficiently PC plaque would ideal platform new treatment strategy patient . Pressurized IntraPeritoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy ( PIPAC ) Temperature pressure important factor absorption fluid peritoneal cavity , use relative low intraperitoneal pressure ( 2-6 mmHg ) seem increase inflow intraperitoneal fluid abdominal wall . Studies confirm high tissue concentration chemotherapy may obtain increase intraperitoneal pressure . After year extensive testing , development micro-pump safe aerosol infusion , German research group design system allow laparoscopy control , intraperitoneal aerosol infusion chemotherapy ( doxorubicin cisplatin ) . The aerosol technique ensure entire peritoneal surface cover chemotherapy , relevant patient PC . With micro-pump position standard trocar point away bowel , commercially available injection pump provide necessary pressure induce aerosol mist cover peritoneal cavity . After five minute , chemotherapy deliver , injector turn . After additional 25 minute simple diffusion , intra-abdominal air saturate chemotherapy evacuate standard trocar . Recently , German research group publish preliminary experience PIPAC gastric ovarian cancer patient PC . PIPAC available freely market , procedure FDA approve yet . The German research team emphasize , despite encouraging result obtain far , efficacy safety PIPAC still assess adequate clinical trial . Aim In compassionate use program , aim study implement evaluate PIPAC procedure Odense University Hospital strict observation patient occupational health safety aspect . Thus , important emphasize , primary aim feasibility study quick safe implementation new combine surgical-oncologic treatment technique use conventional chemotherapy new way desperately ill cancer patient . For technical safety reason implementation need fulfil documented patient enrol clinical trial . Hypothesis The investigator expect PIPAC procedure feasible safe , primary non-access ratio maximum 7:35 ( mainly due adhesion ) . The investigator expect CTCAE grade 3 procedure safe patient , surgeon OR staff . Method Study design This feasibility study PIPAC procedure perform 35 patient fulfil inclusion criterion . Implementation PIPAC procedure In order cover safety aspects secure optimal treatment result , complete manual checklist entire PIPAC procedure , well pre- postoperative patient handling , make . Thus , every step procedure carefully describe monitor , prior first patient treatment , entire PIPAC procedure try `` dummy '' OR setup supervised German group . Although group document , procedure safe patient health care worker , procedure perform OR laminar airflow close carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) ventilation system . In addition , environmental measurement ( platinum particle within OR ) bio-monitoring ( blood sample ) OR team schedule begin first PIPAC procedure . Preliminary clinical evaluation 35 patient PC ( see inclusion criterion ) schedule PIPAC . In collaboration German group , local multidisciplinary team ( MDT ) meeting carefully select patient suitable PIPAC procedure . These patient include accord national regulation rule experimental cancer research . All PIPAC procedure perform prophylactic antibiotic start classification extent PC ( Peritoneal Cancer Index , PCI ) follow select quadrant biopsy document malignancy later translational research . The type dose chemotherapy ( 1/10 systemic dose ) , intra-abdominal pressure , temperature delivery time similar used German group . After PIPAC procedure , patient observe two day discharge . The treatment response monitor CT , follow-up laparoscopy procedure PCI score biopsy six week . The PIPAC procedure repeat evaluation laparoscopy objective response progression observe . Adverse medical event grade accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE , version 4.0 ) , surgical related complication accord Dindo-Clavien classification . Intra-abdominal access completion PIPAC procedure 28 35 patient discharge group within 2 POD consider successful implementation PIPAC procedure . Occupational health safety aspect For safety reason staff OR PIPAC procedure . The injector control footswitch outside OR room , observation monitor related anesthesiology also make visible outside OR . Since personnel inside ventilate OR room application aerosolize chemotherapy , three barrier surgeons/OR staff chemotherapy : The closed abdominal cavity , laminar airflow system OR wall . The tightness abdominal cavity control allow maximum CO2 flow 0.1-0.2 L/min correspond body resorption CO2 . After procedure , intraabdominal air saturate chemotherapy evacuate series filter close system . Closure trocar site , removal disposal dressing syringe special chemotherapy waste bin perform surgeon alone . Environmental biomonitoring blood sample surgeon OR staff schedule part safety monitoring . Patient safety All patient carefully select ( see exclusion criterion ) MDT . The establish pneumoperitoneum use trocars base high standard laparoscopic surgery high safety profile . The procedure perform experienced laparoscopic surgeon supervision German team . When follow safety protocol used German group , mortality relate PIPAC procedure observe . The risk bowel perforation 2 per mille , port site metastasis occur 0.6 % procedure , self- limit erythema around trocar site find 1.2 % procedure ( private communication , professor Marc A. Reymond ) . A short period postoperative fever and/or elevate acute phase proteins observed PIPAC procedure , majority patient may discharge follow day , PIPAC procedure repeat several time .</detailed_description>
