	<detailed_description>Hospitalization strong independent risk factor Sarcopenia . Older adult hospitalized previous year experience great loss lean mass muscle strength non-hospitalized peer . Most research focus understanding muscle atrophy cause weakness . However , post-hospitalization muscle weakness solely due muscle atrophyâ€” explain less 10 % variance . The investigator propose sequela hospitalization ( e.g . deconditioning , disease severity , etc . ) reduce integrity brain motor pattern use produce forceful muscle contraction . Evidence literature suggest central nervous system impairment explain approximately 60 % variance loss muscle strength observe following hospitalization . However , finding help move field forward , measure lack spatial resolution . Accordingly , remain major gap understand whether deterioration specific brain motor tract contribute post-hospitalization induced sarcopenia . The investigator intend conduct prospective cohort study examine integrity cortical-spinal white matter tract post-hospitalized older adult . However , investigator lack essential element conduct future study . Therefore , pilot study refine follow : patient eligibility , feasibility collect outcome patient , variance statistical power , influence covariates , timeline , patient attrition rate , data analysis strategy magnetic resonance image protocol map cortical-spinal tract . The investigator accomplish operational aim efficiently cost-effectively leverage fund newly award R01 Dr. Catherine Price , seek identify pre-surgical neuroimaging biomarkers follow total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) ( R01NR014181 ; IRB # 487-2012 ) . Specifically , investigator add measure sarcopenia ( muscle strength , mass gait ) ass integrity cortico-spinal tract . Measures collect 20 patient hospitalization ( prior surgery , 3 month 12 month post-surgery ) 20 control match age disease severity similar time point . In summary , long-term impairment result hospitalization old adult explain illness alone . This pilot study result subsequent large NIH fund study research distinct others conduct muscle function , age effect hospitalization .</detailed_description>
