	<brief_summary>Arterial blood-gas ( ABG ) measurement gold standard evaluate pulmonary gas exchange . However , arterial puncture painful venous puncture , ICU patient , cause great anxiety tracheal aspiration . The technique show effectively reduce pain arterial puncture subcutaneous injection lidocaine . However , technique time consume poorly use . Topical anesthesia widely use arterial puncture despite lack proof efficacy . While perform arterial puncture small gauge needle feasible , best investigator knowledge study assess effect needle gauge arterial puncture relate pain . The aim present study compare pain experienced arterial puncture perform 25 G 23 G needle . The secondary endpoint characterization pain anxiety associate arterial puncture .</brief_summary>
