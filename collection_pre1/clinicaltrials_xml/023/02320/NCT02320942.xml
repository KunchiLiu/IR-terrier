	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : Our long-term goal conduct randomize clinical trial investigate whether physician-prescribed supervised exercise intervention allogeneic stem cell transplant ( alloHSCT ) patient within Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant ( LBMT ) Program BC result improve QoL compare intervention . This current study pilot study primary aim determine feasibility , include recruitment , retention , adherence , deliver intervention standard care . HYPOTHESES : 1 . The physician-prescribed exercise intervention feasible term recruitment ( goal 20 patient recruit study period ) , retention ( ≥70 % ) , adherence ( ≥70 % ) participant . 2 . The intervention safe highly acceptable participant . JUSTIFICATION : Allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplantation ( alloHSCT ) use treat malignant non-malignant hematopoeitic disease include leukemia , lymphoma , bone marrow failure syndrome . Recent advance alloHSCT lead improved relapse-free overall survival ( OS ) ; however alloHSCT remains associated significant morbidity include chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , infectious immune complication , reduce physical performance functioning due deconditioning , sarcopenia , bone loss , particularly high level fatigue psycho-social stress , negatively impact patient ' quality life ( QoL ) . There accumulate body evidence emphasize physical activity ( PA ) may one modifiable lifestyle factor potential positively influence QoL , physical function health-related outcome HSCT survivor . Currently alloHSCT patient Canada , include BC , little access exercise program address unique barrier within population , particularly early post-transplant period need great . These include concern use public gym due immunocompromised state , supervision train professional , ability exercise low blood count post-transplant complication . OBJECTIVES : 1 . To determine feasibility ( recruitment , retention , adherence ) deliver physician-prescribed supervised exercise intervention alloHSCT recipient standard care . 2 . To assess change health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) , fatigue , physical functioning , body composition , biomarkers immune reconstitution , therapy-related toxicity institution physician-prescribed supervised exercise intervention alloHSCT recipient . RESEARCH METHOD : Study Design Population : This study prospective pre-post test single-arm pilot study assess feasibility intervention . Eligible participant adult ≥ 18 year age undergoing alloHSCT indication LBMT Program BC VGH . Participants must able fill questionnaires English . Participants exclude contraindication entrance exercise program ( i.e. , musculoskeletal issue clear exercise attend physician ) . Eligible participant identify transplant physician inform consent obtain research team . Intervention : At discharge inpatient unit , participant receive practical introduction exercise specialist enrol 12-week exercise intervention . The semi-supervised intervention progressive program goal three aerobic two resistance exercise session per week . Aerobic exercise consist 20-40 minute bicycle use stationary bike locate CP6 ( supervise un-supervised ) brisk walk home . Resistance exercise include exercise upper low extremity stretch band ( 8-20 repetition , 2 3 set ) . Patients complete least one supervise aerobic resistance session per week exercise trainer complete daily log exercise , include adherence , adverse event symptom . At weekly supervise session , exercise specialist review adherence intervention provide support question overcome identified barrier adherence . Contraindications start training session include active infection ( temperature &gt; 38oC ) , severe pain , nausea dizziness , platelet count &lt; 20 000/uL Hb &lt; 80 g/L . Exercise session stop pain , dizziness , contraindication occur . These contraindication keep previous study exercise population deem safe . Data Collection Endpoints : Follow-up assessment occur baseline ( pre-BMT visit ) , discharge inpatient ward ( within first week attend CP6 ) , day 60 , day 100 post-BMT ( approximately 12-weeks ) . Baseline demographic : Demographic data collect patient interview baseline , include age , health condition physical activity level prior HSCT . Medical transplantation variable obtain patient ' medical record . HRQoL : Patients QoL assess European Organization Research Treatment Cancer Quality Life Questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ) , evaluate different factor HRQoL 5 functional 9 symptom subscales/items , well global score HRQoL . This tool use extensively HSCT population , include 6 7 trial identify systematic review meta-analysis exercise effect HRQoL HSCT patient . Functional assessment : PFTs do baseline day 100 already standard care . Aerobic fitness assess use 6 minute walk test ( 6MWT ) protocol American Thoracic Society . This test use extensively clinical exercise trial estimate aerobic capacity test HSCT population . Muscle strength evaluate 30-second chair stand ( low extremity ) , component Senior 's Fitness test , grip strength ( upper extremity ) . Mobility measure time-up-and go test . This test complete CP6 exercise specialist . Body Composition Analysis : Standing height , body weight , waist hip circumference measure . Baseline bone mineral density testing ( BMD ) , 1,25-OH vitamin D calcium level , dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan perform Dr. Kendler , pre-transplant day +100 standard care . The DXA scan well validated tool accurately precisely measure lean , fat , mineral composition number strength compare modality body composition measurement . Immune function : Markers immune function include total white blood cell count , lymphocyte count , CD4+ CD8+ subsets T-lymphocytes , T-regulatory cell test pre-BMT Day 100 . These marker previously evaluate study exercise intervention HSCT patient inconsistent result . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Primary Aim ( Objective 1 ) : For large RCT , sample size base expect mean change global HRQoL intervention group 5 point standard deviation literature base prior study use EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire . We would able reject null hypothesis mean change global HRQoL intervention control group equal power 80 % enroll 41 patient group . The Type I error probability associate test null hypothesis 0.05 two-sided . To account maximum 30 % dropout rate ( base expect 20 % transplant-related mortality 10 % dropout rate ) , plan enroll 120 patient ( 60 group ) large RCT . This may modify base result current study . Specific feasibility objective study : 1 . To determine study recruitment rate : The study consider feasible recruit 20 participant . Over last 5 year , average number alloHSCTs perform VGH LBMT Program BC 90 per year , average approximately 30 transplant per 4-month period . Based preparatory period 2 month , recruitment 4-month period , requirement 100 day ( 3-4 month ) follow-up last patient enrol , time analysis ( see Project Timeline ) , 20 patient reasonable recruitment target pilot study . This translate 20 patient per 4-month period , would mean minimum 2 year recruit 120 patient large trial . Recruitment rate assess interim mark 2 month . If anticipate , review team barrier recruitment modify recruit strategy . 2 . To determine study retention rate : This study consider feasible ≥ 70 % sample complete day 100 assessment . Prior study demonstrate 72 % 38 77 % 40 patient complete final assessment , form basis estimate . 3 . To determine adherence exercise intervention : The intervention consider feasible participant complete ≥ 70 % prescribed number exercise session end follow-up . Prior data indicate adherence PA intervention alloHSCT patient 85 % , range 68 % 90 % .24 We reduce 70 % due medical acuity participant possible compete time demand active medical treatment . 4 . Recruitment retention summarize use CONSORT flow diagram ( http : //www.consort-statement.org/ ) . Analysis feasibility objective descriptive base estimate 95 % confidence interval . Secondary Aim ( Objective 2 ) : Descriptive statistic report mean standard deviation continuous variable number ( % ) categorical variable . Changes outcome variable baseline day 100 analyze use paired-samples test ( continuous data ) , Wilcoxon sign rank test ( ordinal data ) , McNemar 's test ( categorical data ) . For variable also assess discharge day 60 , repeat measure analysis variance use . Subgroup analyse conduct patient base intensity condition regimen ( myeloablative versus reduced-intensity ) base whether patient receive glucocorticoid therapy . Statistical analysis perform use STATA version 12.1 ( College Station , TX ) type I error rate 0.05 assume statistical test . The Bonferroni method use adjust level significance multiple test secondary outcome overall level alpha=0.05 .</detailed_description>
