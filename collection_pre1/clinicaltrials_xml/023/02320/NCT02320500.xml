	<brief_summary>Patients chronic knee pain attribute osteoarthritis refer orthopedics potential candidate knee replacement receive standard physiotherapy myofascial-specific therapy 8 week . Based investigator pilot investigation , investigator expect receive myofascial-specific therapy experience reduce pain ( compare standard therapy group ) increase flexibility compare baseline level . This simple conservative therapy could postpone ( case , eliminate ) need knee replacement since pain major indication surgery . If successful , treatment could improve quality life increase productivity thousand suffer knee osteoarthritis preserve valuable health care resource .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approvals ( Ethics Board Health Canada ) already obtain currently propose prospective randomize , single-blinded , control clinical trial . The overall objective current investigation determine whether myofascial pain-specific therapy ( include trigger-point injection myofascial-specific physiotherapy ) provide good pain relief improve knee function compare standard-of-care physiotherapy patient refer orthopedics potential surgical candidate . Specifically , investigator hypothesis : Patients knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) may candidate total knee arthroplasty 1 ) significantly reduce pain ( compare receive standard care physiotherapy ) improve function ( compare baseline ) myofascial pain therapy 2 ) receive myofascial therapy delay and/or reduce need TKA compare standard-of-care physiotherapy group . Patients chronic knee pain attribute osteoarthritis refer orthopedics potential candidate knee replacement receive standard physiotherapy myofascial-specific therapy 8 week . The Primary outcome pain score ( 10 point visual analogue scale ( VAS ) ) participant follow standard-of-care physiotherapy versus myofascial pain-specific therapy 8 week . The Secondary outcome include : ( Comparisons and/or within group appropriate ) : - Pain score biweekly 8 week , 3 month 6 month - Decision proceed surgery ( yes/no ) -to assess alteration need TKA - Decision continue treatment- ( yes/no ) treatment beneficial ? - Function -Biodex , 6 min.walk test , Timed go- Measured baseline 3 month follow last therapy session standard vs. myofascial -is myofascial therapy good function ? - Brief Pain Interference ( BPI ) short form- Baseline , 2 week 8 weeks- ass pain interference - Oxford knee scores-Baseline , 2 8 weeks- report functional disability ( compare group objective measure ) - McGill SF pain questionnaire Baseline , 2 week 8 weeks-to ass pain quality - SF-12 Baseline , 2 week 8 weeks-to ass quality life - Analgesics consume Baseline , 2 week , 8 week , 6 months-to ass pain level - Compare X-ray osteoarthritis ( OA ) grade initial assessment MTPs-Does presence myofascial trigger point ( MTPs ) explain discordance OA grade pain ? - Pain score 10 cm visual analogue scale Baseline , 2 week , 6 months- ass change pain intensity - Surgery 6 month follow-up ?
