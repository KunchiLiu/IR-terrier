	<criteria>For information regard BMS clinical trial participation , please visit www.BMSStudyConnect.com 1 . Target Population 1 . Histologically confirm malignant melanoma measurable metastasis brain . Both asymptomatic symptomatic patient . 2 . Cohort A ( asymptomatic patient ) : At least 1 measurable brain metastasis ≥ 0.5 cm ≤ 3 cm long diameter previously irradiate . No clinical requirement local intervention ( surgery , radiosurgery , corticosteroid therapy ) systemic therapy Cohort B ( symptomatic patient ) : Subjects neurologic sign symptom relate metastatic brain lesion eligibile . Subjects must least 1 measurable brain metastasis ≥ 0.5 cm ≤ 3 cm long diameter previously irradiate . No immediate requirement ( within 3 week prior first treatment ) local intervention ( surgery , radiosurgery , corticosteroid therapy ) . Steroid use permit defined protocol . 3 . Prior stereotactic radiotherapy ( SRT ) prior excision 3 melanoma brain metastasis permit complete recovery , neurologic sequela , measurable lesion remain . Growth change lesion previously irradiate consider measurable . Regrowth cavity previously excise lesion consider measurable . lesion prior excision must occur ≥ 3 week start dose study 4 . Must tumor tissue available biomarker analysis . Biopsy excisional , incisional , punch , core needle 5 . Cohort A ( asymptomatic ) : Subjects must free neurologic sign symptom relate metastatic brain lesion must require received systemic corticosteroid therapy within 10 day prior first treatment . Cohort B ( symptomatic ) : Subjects neurologic sign symptom relate metastatic brain lesion eligible per Amendment 02 . Subjects neurologic sign symptom may treat total daily dose 4 mg dexamethasone stable taper 10 day prior first treatment . Subjects neurologic sign symptom treat steroid eligible Cohort B experience seizure within 10 day prior first treatment . 6 . Allowable prior therapy : 1 . Approved adjuvant therapy , may include molecularlytargeted agent , IFN α , ipilimumab . Patients receive ipilimumab adjuvant therapy must 6 month washout receive dose study 2 . For advanced disease , interleukin2 dose and/or IFNα ( formulation , washout require ) ; MEK BRAF inhibitor : washout least 4 week prior start dose study 3 . Steroids physiological replacement allow . 7 . Cohort A ( asymptomatic ) : ECOG performance status ≤1 Cohort B ( symptomatic ) : ECOG performance status ≤2 2 . Target Disease Exceptions 1 . History known leptomeningeal involvement ( lumbar puncture require ) 2 . Previous stereotactic highly conformal radiotherapy within 3 week start dose study . Note stereotactic radiotherapy field must include brain index lesion ( ) 3 . Brain lesion &gt; 3 lesion previously treat SRT 4 . Brain lesion size &gt; 3cm 3 . Medical History Concurrent Diseases ) History whole brain irradiation b ) Subjects active , know suspected autoimmune disease c ) Subjects major medical , neurologic psychiatric condition judge unable fully comply study therapy assessment enrol ) Any concurrent malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix . For prior invasive malignancy , least 5 year must elapse since curative therapy patient must residual sequela prior therapy e ) Cohort A ( asymptomatic ) : The use corticosteroid allow within 10 day prior first treatment ( base upon 5 time expect half life dexamethasone ) except patient take steroids physiological replacement . If alternative corticosteroid therapy use , consultation sponsor Medical Monitor require determine washout period prior initiate study treatment Cohort B ( symptomatic ) : Subjects neurologic sign symptom relate brain metastasis treat total daily dose high 4 mg dexamethasone equivalent within 10 prior start treatment study drug exclude . 4 . Physical Laboratory Test Findings 1 . Positive test hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBV sAg ) hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid ( HCV antibody ) indicate acute chronic infection 2 . Known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) even fully immunocompetent ART—due unknown effect HIV immune response combine nivolumab plus ipilimumab unique toxicity spectrum drug patient HIV 5 . Allergies Adverse Drug Reaction ) History allergy study drug component b ) History severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody 6 . Other Exclusion Criteria 1 . Prisoners subject involuntarily incarcerate 2 . Subjects compulsorily detain treatment either psychiatric physical ( e.g. , infectious disease ) illness Eligibility criterion study carefully consider ensure safety study subject result study use . It imperative subject fully meet eligibility criterion Other protocol define inclusion/exclusion criterion could apply</criteria>
