	<brief_title>Prevalence Protein-energy Wasting Obesity Among Danish Dialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Undernutrition among dialysis patient associate increased morbidity mortality . Conversely , hemodialysis ( HD ) patient high BMI range obesity long know protective death cardiovascular disease , phenomenon call reverse epidemiology . Hence , good background population might differ good HD patient . In peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) patient association less clear . The majority study find reverse epidemiology , however study find survival advantage obesity even indicate high risk death obese patient . Some author claim reverse epidemiology misconception although short run high BMI protective follow period five year show increased mortality . Considering Mutsert et al . claim HD patient mortality risk pattern associate BMI general population . Moreover , show protective effect high BMI weight gain limited normal high muscle mass . Patients high BMI malnutrition high risk death . Concordantly , recent study show abdominal obesity associate mortality among dialysis patient . The prevalence under-nutrition , often know protein energy wasting ( PEW ) , among dialysis patient vary 31 % 51 % prevalence obesity vary 10-56 % presumably depend diagnostic criterion method use . These inconsistent result make comparison prevalence undernutrition obesity among dialysis population somewhat problematic . In order standardize diagnosis PEW dialysis patient International Society Renal Nutrition Metabolism ( ISRNM ) suggest diagnostic criterion . As go obesity , standardize method diagnose among dialysis patient . However , review recommend use multiple different method concurrently include BMI , fat percentage ( FM % ) , measure abdominal fat . Data nutritional status among dialysis patient Northern Europe primary derive single research center ( Karolinska institute , Sweden ) recent publish data prevalence PEW among dialysis patient . A single study examines prevalence obesity . Few study compare nutritional status HD PD patient . Hardly study examine prevalence undernutrition obesity population . Knowing nutritional status dialysis population identify already malnourish patient , contribute quality care provide . Hence , aim study , first time Northern Europe ass prevalence PEW obesity population use ISRNM criterion well different obesity marker . Additionally , compare nutritional status HD PD patient . Design The study design cross-sectional study , investigate nutritional status hemodialysis ( HD ) patient peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) patient attend dialysis centre Roskilde Hospital , Denmark February June 2014 . Subjects All PD , HD home-HD patient ( n = 105 ) invite participate . Patients refuse participate invited complete partial nutritional examination . The participate eligible patient give write consent . Patient data ( age , gender , dialysis vintage , primary kidney disease co morbid condition take patient record . The local ethical committee approve study protocol . Anthropometric measurement Anthropometric measurement perform immediately dialysis session ( HD ) recommend HEMO study monthly ambulatory control ( PD , home-HD ) . All measurement do non-access side body HD-patients right side PD-patients . Skin fold ( SF ) measure Harpenden caliper circumference do use non-stretchable fiberglass insertion tape ( seca 201 ) . All measurement make well-trained research assistant . Height ( h ) bodyweight ( BW ) measure light clothe use standard instrument dialysis centre . For PD weigh preferably do empty abdominal cavity , ( n=8 ) refuse empty abdominal cavity bodyweight calculate BW dialysate minus volume dialysate last drained abdomen . For patient low leg amputation ( n=2 ) 6.2 % total bodyweight per amputate leg add measure weight Fat mass assess accord formula describe Durnin Womersley base four skinfold thickness ( biceps , triceps , subscapular suprailiac ) . Mid-arm circumference ( MAC ) measure midway acromion olecranon . All measurement do duplicate . If two measurement four mm apart , two additional measurement do mean four calculate . This approach recommend `` CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES For Nutrition Chronic Renal Failure '' . Triceps skinfold ( TSF ) MAC use calculate correct mid-arm muscle area ( cMAMA ) describe Heymsfield SB et al . Waist circumference ( WC ) measure recommend WHO . Patients unable stand waist hip circumference measurement do supine position . The waist hip measurement skip empty abdominal cavity feasible PD patient . All measurement do duplicate difference two measurement exceed 1 cm , two measurement do , mean four calculate . Lean body mass index ( LBMI ) fat mass index ( FMI ) calculate lean body mass ( LBM ) /h2 fat mass ( FM ) /h2 respectively describe Kyle et al . Blood sample biochemical measurement For assessment s-transferrin albumin blood sample patient analyzed laboratory Roskilde Sygehus , Denmark . Kt/V measure describe F.A.Gotch ( Gotch 1998 ) . For HD-patients normalized protein catabolic rate ( nPCR ) determine measure interdialytic rise blood urea nitrogen midweek dialysis session . For patient residual urine output &gt; 300ml/day urinary nitrogen excretion also take account . To account day-to-day variation calculate mean three nPCR measurement , make 2 month period anthropometric measurement , make one urine sample . For PD-patients nPCR measure use Bergstroms ' formula . Only one nPCR measurement do PD patient</detailed_description>
