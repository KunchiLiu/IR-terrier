	<brief_title>2D Versus 3D Radical Laparoscopic Hysterectomy Endometrial Cancer : Prospective Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard treatment early-stage endometrial cancer surgery . Surgical procedure include wash cytology , total extrafascial hysterectomy bilateral salpinges-oophorectomy . Although therapeutic value routine pelvic para-aortic lymphadenectomy debate , stag information critical determinant adjuvant therapy gynecologic oncologist . Type-1 endometrial cancer spread limit pelvic node case . If positive lymph node , around obturator nerve around external common iliac vessel likely involved presacral area . Isolated involvement para-aortic node rare . Complete excision node locate around iliac vessel obturator nerve allow identiﬁcation 90 % node-positive patient . The decision whether undertake lymphadenectomy base palpation nodal area , le 10 % patient nodal metastasis grossly enlarge node . Patients endometrioid cancer , grade 1-2 deep myometrial invasion grade 3 endometrioid endometrial cancer least 5 % risk positive pelvic lymph node . In current treatment protocol , patient undergo complete pelvic lymphadenectomy . Laparotomy may indicate endometrial cancer patient present grossly positive pelvic node , grossly positive adnexal metastasis , serosal inﬁltration . Although complication rate simple hysterectomy bilateral salpinges-oophorectomy high , 70 % new case endometrial cancer diagnose post-menopausal woman , commonly associate medical co-morbidities , diabetes , hypertension obesity . Abdominal surgery therefore expose increase risk complication . Vaginal hysterectomy suggest attractive alternative abdominal surgery patient , approach allow exploration abdominal cavity , peritoneal washing , lymph-node dissection . Laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy total laparoscopic hysterectomy overcome previous limitation . In 1993 , Childers et al first propose laparoscopy option early-stage endometrial cancer . Despite recognize benefit , many surgeon find approach difficult routine use relatively center offer laparoscopic hysterectomy lymphadenectomy majority patient . From first report 12 major report use laparoscopy , often compare series similar patient stag laparotomy . Clear advantage , reduction peri-operative complication , short hospital stay earlier recovery , confirm series . Failure complete staging procedure laparoscopy range 5 35 % patient , frequently due obesity patient . In reality 2005 researcher suggest laparoscopic surgery safe obese elderly patient endometrial cancer . Moreover , approach seem modify incidence recurrence overall patient survival . The big randomize trial plan study difference morbidity survival laparoscopy laparotomy endometrial cancer GOG LAP-2 study , Dutch study Bijen Mourits , Australian study LACE . Unfortunately none three randomise trial yet report survival data , health-related issue complication . In GOG study , patient clinical stage I IIA uterine cancer randomly assign laparoscopy ( n = 1,696 ) open laparotomy ( n = 920 ) , include hysterectomy , salpinges-oophorectomy , pelvic cytology , pelvic para-aortic lymphadenectomy . Laparoscopy result few postoperative moderate severe adverse event , short hospital stay , longer operative time laparotomy . The median operative time open laparotomy arm 130 minute ( range 102-167 minute ) , laparoscopy arm , 204 minute ( ring 160-252 minute ; P &lt; .001 ) . In Dutch study major minor complication rate group patient treat laparoscopy compare laparotomy . However , TLH associate less blood loss , less use pain medication , short hospital stay , longer operative time TAH . The median duration surgery 115 minute TLH group , ( range 35-267 ) 71 minute ( range 31-239 ) TAH group . The difference GOG study probably due fact patient Netherlands underwent hysterectomy bilateral salpinges-oophorectomy complete surgical stag include pelvic para-aortic lymphadenectomy . In Australian LACE study patient stage I endometrioid adenocarcinoma randomly assign TLH ( n=190 ) TAH ( n=142 ) . Surgeons require perform pelvic node ( without ) para-aortic lymph-node dissection part treatment group . Operating time significantly longer TLH group ( 138 minute [ SD 43 ] ) TAH group ( 109 minute [ 34 ] ; p=0•001 ) . Health-related outcome report three trial . Better physical functioning , body image , reduce pain , early resumption work 6-week post-laparoscopy period report GOG Dutch study laparotomy patient , difference disappear 6 month surgery . In Australian study , quality life still improve 6 month surgery . In conclusion , laparoscopic treatment endometrial cancer clinically confine uterus associated less pain , short hospital stay , fast recovery , good quality life least 3 month post surgery , longer operative time laparotomy . Another recent single institution Italian trial randomize patient clinical stage I endometrial cancer receive TLH ( n=81 ) TAH ( n=78 ) bilateral salpinges-oophorectomy bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy . Para-aortic lymphadenectomy perform select case . The mean operative time 123 minute ± 29 ( 95 % CI 111-198 ) LPT group 136 minute ± 31 ( 95 % CI 118- 181 ) LPS group ( P &lt; 0.01 ) . These operative time match closely experience laparotomy laparoscopy , use conventional bipolar electrosurgery . Shortening operative time laparoscopy could increase benefit laparoscopic approach , especially obese patient . Overweight ( define body-mass index [ BMI ] least 25 kg/m2 ) infect important risk factor present almost 50 % woman endometrial cancer . Since patient characterise several systemic physiopathological alteration , perioperative management may present problem , mainly relate respiratory system ( obstructive sleep apnea , airway intubation atelectasis ) . Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome ( OSA ) occur 70 % morbidly obese patient undergo surgery OSA know risk factor adverse perioperative outcome . Shortening operative time could reduce perioperative complication postoperative pain . This could translate few day hospitalization low incidence hospital infection low cost health care system . This prospective randomized pilot study aim verify operative time TLH pelvic lymphadenectomy endometrial cancer FIGO stage IB-II could reduce use 3D laparoscopy ( Olympus Medical Systems Corp ) v standard laparoscopy . Secondary endpoint comparison incidence intra- postoperative complication ( Cardiac , Respiratory , Neurological , Gastrointestinal , Renal , Fever , Wound Infection , Lymphocele ) , estimate blood loss , day hospitalization cost health care system .</detailed_description>
