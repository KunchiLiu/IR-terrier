	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot clinical trial study melanoma antigen recognize T-cells 1 ( MART-1 ) antigen without toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) agonist glucopyranosyl lipid A-stable oil-in-water emulsion ( GLA-SE ) treat patient stage II-IV melanoma remove surgery . Vaccines make MART-1a peptide antigen may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving TLR4 agonist GLA-SE MART-1 antigen may help increase immune response MART-1a antigen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MART-1 Antigen With Without TLR4 Agonist GLA-SE Treating Patients With Stage II-IV Melanoma That Has Been Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate immune response immunization regimen determine optimal regimen term immune response recommend phase II testing . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate adverse event profile immunization regimen . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe immunological efficacy vaccine preparation measure frequency interferon ( IFN ) gamma production peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive MART-1 antigen TLR4 antagonist GLA-SE intramuscularly ( IM ) day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive MART-1 antigen IM day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , stage II patient follow 10 week 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month stage III-IV patient follow 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 month .</detailed_description>
