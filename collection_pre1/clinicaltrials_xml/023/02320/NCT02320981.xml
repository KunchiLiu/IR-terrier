	<brief_summary>Our hypothesis patient GERD and/or Eosinophilic Esophagitis ( EE ) low esophageal impedance measurement compare patient GERD EE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mucosal Impedance Pediatric Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal project develop assess novel , inexpensive , minimally invasive technology detect mucosal damage base mucosal conductivity change pediatric population . The study base preliminary work Sandhill Scientific , Inc. adult gastroenterology department . They collaborate create novel , minimally invasive Mucosal Impedance ( MI ) test ( proprietary technology ) base animal study show esophageal tissue expose acidic weakly acidic injurious agent cause dilation intercellular space loss tight junction along squamous epithelial lining esophagus result measurable decreased baseline impedance.9 Adult study confirm correlation decrease impedance diseased tissue , however studied child . We hypothesize pediatric patient histologic damage see GERD EoE mucosal change result decreased electrical impedance compare normal histology . We propose technology accurately reliably measure mucosal consequence chronic esophageal exposure injurious gastroduodenal agent food allergen . Thus , test would serve minimally invasive screen tool GERD EoE prior endoscopy , allow longitudinal monitoring mucosal response therapy .</detailed_description>
