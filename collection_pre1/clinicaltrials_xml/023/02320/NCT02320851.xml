	<detailed_description>Vertigo/dizziness ( VD ) one frequent problem medicine one-year prevalence 23 % . Approximately 50 % complex VD disorder ( i.e. , VD cardinal symptom persist &gt; 6 month ) fully explain identifiable medical condition could label somatoform vertigo/dizziness ( SVD ) , fulfil criterion somatoform disorder accord ICD-10 DSM-IV , respectively .

Although preliminary evidence indicate psychotherapy may effective patient , therapeutic option treatment SVD remain unsatisfactory . In two-armed , single-centre , randomise , control , open superiority clinical trial , long-term efficacy manualised , multimodal group psychotherapy , base integrative psychotherapy ( IPT ) tailor SVD subgroup mental disorder investigate patient SVD compare self-help group ( SHGs ) . IPT describe differentiate psychotherapeutic approach , combine different therapeutic technique , interpersonal skill psychodynamic aspect , self-management symptom management skill , psychoeducation , relaxation technique . Within study , IPT tailor SVD include common mental comorbidity . Patients recruit via routine care appointment German Centre Vertigo Balance Disorders , specialise tertiary care unit Klinikum Großhadern ( Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet , Munich ) . Our principal research question follow : Will IPT result clinically relevant improvement vertigo/dizziness-related quality life ? Does long-term improvement also apply associate mental symptom , depression , anxiety somatisation , well balance strategy measure posturography ? Is IPT long term superior moderate SVD-SHGs ? The investigator hypothesise patient receive IPT demonstrate great improvement concern vertigo-related handicap compare patient SHGs . The investigator also analyse cost-effectiveness trial .</detailed_description>
