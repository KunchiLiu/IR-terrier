	<brief_summary>A Prospective , Multicenter , Randomized Phase-Ii Trial Comparing Efficacy And Safety Of Fludarabine + Cyclophosphamide + Ga101 ( Fcg ) And Bendamustine + Ga101 ( Bg ) In Patients With Relapsed Or Refractory Cll Followed By Maintenance Therapy With Ga101 For Responding Patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CLLR3 : Bendamustine + GA101 ( BG ) Relapsed Refractory CLL Followed GA101 Maintenance Responding Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The type II anti-CD20 antibody GA101 demonstrate high efficacy single agent ( ORR 62 % ) well tolerate previously treat patient CLL . Additionally , evidence immunochemotherapy consist fludarabine , cyclophosphamide rituximab ( FCR ) active patient refractory relapse CLL . Besides FCR , combination bendamustine rituximab ( BR ) show active relapse previously untreated patient CLL . In preclinical study GA101 , glycoengineered , humanize type II anti-CD20 antibody , show superior activity compare type I antibodies . Therefore , combination therapy FC + GA101 ( FCG ) B + GA101 ( BG ) might improve therapeutic outcome relapse refractory CLL . The CLLR3 trial design investigate compare efficacy safety induction immunochemotherapies follow additionally maintenance therapy GA101 respond patient .</detailed_description>
