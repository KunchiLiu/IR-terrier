	<brief_title>A Comparison Physical Activity Levels With Without Feedback Via Fitbit® Flex™ Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In prior study analyze physical activity dialysis patient , three-dimensional accelerometer , physical performance task self-reporting physical activity questionnaire use measure level activity . This propose study differs determine effectiveness provide `` feedback '' dialysis patient use fitness track bracelet . For purpose study , word 'feedback ' use refer information provide subject demonstrates number step take since previous dialysis session display Fitbit® application . This 'feedback ' allow subject aware overall physical activity quantitative level . The study seek explore association feedback physical activity . Improved physical activity could improve indicator subject ' health status blood pressure , inflammatory marker , pre-albumin level , also monitor record . While inform subject quantitatively level physical activity could promise method encourage active , unclear point strategy actually work . This important practical question though , actually inform subject regular basis activity level may pose substantial operative challenge result additional cost . The importance encouraging subject physically active underestimated . Studying physical activity dialysis patient important allow researcher consider long-term effect may influence subject 's well-being . Johansen et al . show direct relationship inactivity dialysis patient susceptibility hypertension , diabetes , cardiovascular disease even mortality . Additionally , study demonstrate importance implementing program promote physical activity [ 1 ] . If feedback indeed increase physical activity , substantially beneficial program implement .</detailed_description>
