	<brief_summary>The objective study investigate efficacy fresh , frozen lyophilize fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) via colonoscopy patient recurrent C. difficile associate diarrhea ( RCDAD ) . We generate frozen , lyophilized fresh fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) inoculum well-screened healthy volunteer donor ≥150 gram/sample . Delivery FMT perform colonoscopically . Fecal sample donor recipient save later metagenomic study characterize microbiome gut patient FMT . Donors enrol screen Center Infectious Disease laboratory enteric pathogens University Texas School Public Health ( EPDL-UT-SPH ) College American Pathologist Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments certify laboratory . The donor come variety place , include University Texas School Public Health . We screen least 70 donor recruit least 20 qualified donor . Recipients All patient treat must physician willing care discharge facility . Recipients need insurance willing self-pay therapy . Attending physician recipients/patients order FMT make clinical decision relate overall health his/her patient . All patient undergo therapy handle outpatient either Baylor St. Luke 's Medical Center Texas Medical Center , Digestive Disease Center Memorial Hermann Texas Medical Center , Kelsey-Seybold Clinic - Main Campus Holcombe Blvd . Once procedure complete , recipient transfer back original medical treatment facility release home care care physician . A gastroenterologist privilege Endoscopy procedure site perform FMT via colonoscopy . The Center Infectious Disease enteric pathogen laboratory University Texas School Public Health prepare donor stool administration via colonoscope . We screen least 120 recipient recruit 100 qualified recipient . Evaluation safety FMT recurrence clinical symptom CDAD perform primary physician research coordinator EPDL-UT-SPH . The primary endpoint evaluate safety FMT ( fresh frozen lyophilize health donor feces ) treatment patient 3 episode RCDAD . A second efficacy endpoint evaluate recurrence clinical symptom CDAD initial therapy . In order monitor health effect safety , participant contact quarterly three year follow study completion . The recipient contact investigator pre- approximately 7 , 14 30 day procedure perform . The following procedure complete : review recipient diary recipient ensure follow information record correctly fresh stool sample collect recipient , test C. difficile toxin aliquot ( 2 mL ) store -80C future analysis ( e.g . microbiome ) . The recipient contact phone diarrhea status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The following safety endpoint evaluate study . Medical condition Clinical improvement monitor telephone/email E-mail 90 day FMT . Minor clinical management subject counter medication ( e.g . loperamide , acetaminophen Saccharomyces boulardii [ probiotic ] ) perform case mild diarrhea abdominal pain . All subject follow phone day FMT ass health status week one . Study subject monitor approximately day 7 , 14 30 FMT , time review recipient diary recipient review adverse experience medication take since medical history obtain FMT . Investigators determine adverse experience medication need study . Donor contact tested necessary . All action record medical condition , date adverse experience medication take , indication new medication take , total daily dose ( Patient Data Collection Form ) . Recipients instruct FMT contact Investigator question regard adverse experience appropriateness medication FMT . Monitoring safety The following definition term guide International Conference Harmonization US Code Federal Regulations ( 21 CFR 312.32 ) . An adverse experience unfavorable unintended sign , symptom , disease temporally associate FMT procedure , whether consider related procedure , include , limited : - Any symptom previously report recipient ( Recent Medical History ) - An exacerbation pre-existing illness , increase frequency and/or severity sign symptom CDAD ( define positive C. difficile toxin test enteric symptom ) - A significant increase frequency intensity pre-existing episodic event condition - A condition first detect diagnosed study drug administration even condition may present procedure Details adverse experience occur FMT approximately day 90 visit collect indicated . Serious adverse experience adverse experience : - Results death - Is life threaten ( immediate risk death procedure occur ) - Requires inpatient hospitalization ( overnight stay ) prolongs current hospitalization - Causes persistent significant disability/incapacity - Medical important ( event require medical surgical intervention prevent one outcomes list ) The investigator exercise medical scientific judgment decide whether expeditious report appropriate situation strictly meet list criterion . The investigator meet/discuss expert field question whether adverse experience would consider serious . Severity - The adverse experience document appropriate page Patient Diary accord follow descriptor : - Mild : associate limitation usual activity slight discomfort - Moderate : associate limitation usual activity significant discomfort - Severe : associate inability carry usual activity mark discomfort Relationship - relationship adverse experience FMT assign Investigator accord follow definition : - Probable : reaction follow reasonable temporal sequence procedure follow know expected response pattern suspect procedure could reasonably explain know characteristic patient 's clinical state - Possible : reaction follow reasonable temporal sequence procedure follow know expected response pattern procedure could readily produce number factor - Unlikely : reaction follow reasonable temporal sequence procedure causality FMT rule . - Not relate : reaction sufficient data exist indicate etiology unrelated procedure Pre-existing sign symptom medical condition Medical condition present procedure manifest severity frequency record adverse experience . Similarly , sign symptom related pre-existing disease record adverse experience unless increase severity frequency sign symptom . These pre-existing condition , sign , symptom record Recent Medical History Form . Progression underlying condition adverse experience If progression underlie condition might reasonably anticipate give nature severity underlie condition , progression underlie condition per se constitute adverse experience . However , progression underlie condition fatal , progression underlie condition report adverse experience . Recording document adverse experience The Investigator must completely promptly record new adverse experience serious adverse experience , even relationship adverse experience procedure assess Investigator `` unlikely '' `` relate '' . In addition , investigator must document follow serious adverse experience occur procedure 90 day FMT . The Investigator attempt , possible , establish diagnosis base present sign symptom . If adverse experience meet definition serious adverse experience Investigator must also complete serious adverse experience , also send support source document directly University Texas Health Science Center IRB soon event discover . At visit , patient opportunity mention problem spontaneously , Investigator ( designee ) inquire adverse experience ask standard question list , : - Have medical problem since last visit ? - Have medical problem present last visit change , i.e. , stop , worsen , improve ? - Have take new medicine , study drug , since last visit ? Any spontaneous adverse experience information provide patient report . If adverse experience resolve time Final Visit , Investigator evaluate status adverse experience Follow-Up telephone/email contact ( day 60 ) update reflect status adverse experience ( e.g . ongoing resolve ) . Investigator report serious adverse experience All serious adverse experience must report University Texas Health Science IRB use serious adverse experience facsimile email telephone/email soon serious adverse experience discover , within 24 hour Investigator recognize classifies event serious adverse experience . A brief description event must provide time initial serious adverse experience report . The initial serious adverse experience report follow additional information use serious adverse experience within 48 hour . The report identify patient unique patient number instead names . The complete serious adverse experience Form use investigator regulatory filing . The investigator responsible continue report University Texas Health Science IRB new relevant follow-up information obtain concern serious adverse experience . The result additional assessment conduct must also report University Texas Health Science IRB . Notification post-study serious adverse experience Investigators obligate actively seek follow-up information patient adverse experience conclusion study ( i.e. , &gt; 90 day FMT procedure ) . However , investigator becomes aware adverse experience occur patient completes adverse experience consider Investigator least possibly relate study procedure , investigator must notify University Texas Health Science Center IRB .</detailed_description>
