	<detailed_description>Walking cognitive impairment common person multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Approximately 85 % person MS report walk major limitation , whereas 65 % experience cognitive dysfunction . Traditionally , walk cognition view unrelated , evidence cognitive-motor interference ( CMI ) . CMI believe stem damage common neural substance responsible cognitive motor function . Recent evidence support cognitive-motor interference person MS. For example , evidence walk performance decline perform conjunction simultaneous cognitive task ( i.e. , dual task cost [ DTC ] walk ) . This decline walk performance great person MS compare healthy control associate walk impairment . The degree CMI walking associate walk performance cognitive function people MS. For instance , CMI find related general cognitive function self-reported everyday cognitive error people MS minimal disability . Cognitive-motor interference mobility task practical clinical importance link decrease community mobility great risk fall clinical population stoke , Parkinson 's disease elderly . We recently demonstrate degree CMI walking associate physiological fall risk MS , whereas gait velocity . Evidence gather special population suggest CMI minimize intervention . However , research rehabilitation strategies CMI people MS. One possible approach improve cognitive function reduce CMI involve computerized cognitive testing . This approach capitalize neural plasticity find improve cognitive function , walk balance healthy old adult . Although limited preliminary data suggest type training may improve cognitive function people MS , extant data indicate computerized cognitive training impact mobility . Based association cognitive motor function people MS , possible cognitive training may lead improvement walk performance see clinical population . One major advantage computerize cognitive training complete without direct supervision one 's home minimize various barrier clinic-based rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
