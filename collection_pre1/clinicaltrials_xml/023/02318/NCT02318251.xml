	<detailed_description>Stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) , prevalent type urinary incontinence , define involuntary loss urine effort , physical exertion ( e.g . sport activity ) , upon sneeze , cough ( Haylen et al , 2010 ) . The overall prevalence stress , urge , mixed , UI 23.7 % , 9.9 % , 14.5 % , 49.2 % , respectively ( Minassian et al , 2008 ) . Numerous epidemiologic study show parity risk factor SUI . Other significant risk factor age , weight , obesity , chronic pulmonary disease , ethnic background , menopause . ( Minassian et al , 2008 ; Matthews et al , 2013 ) Urinary incontinence affect four time woman ( 51.1 % ) men ( 13.9 % ) ( Markland et al , 2011 ) . It impact physical , psychosocial , social , personal , economic well-being affected individual family . It associate concomitant impairment activity participation , high risk suffer anxiety disorder show . ( Goldstick &amp; Constantini , 2014 ; Hunskaar et al , 2003 ) . SUI increasingly recognize health economic problem , trouble affect woman , also imply substantial economic burden health social service ( Hampel et al , 2004 ) . Consequently , physiotherapy proven good value money , effectiveness could contribute reduction cost health care . Pelvic floor muscle ( PFM ) able contract strongly ( Shishido et al , 2008 ) , rapidly reflexively ( Deffieux et al ; 2008 ; Morin et al , 2004 ) guarantee continence . The ability PFM generate rapid strong contraction result generation adequate squeeze pressure proximal urethra , maintain pressure high bladder , thus prevent leakage ( Miller et al , 1994 ) . Rapid reflexive PFM contraction crucial maintain continence , precede abrupt rise intra-abdominal pressure associate coughing , sneeze , run , jumping ( Morin et al. , 2004 ) . Studies show PFM function regard power ( rate force development ) impair incontinent woman compare continent woman ( Deffieux et al , 2008 ; Morin et al , 2004 ) . PFM train - define program repeat voluntary PFM contraction teach supervise health care professional - commonly use physiotherapy treatment woman SUI effective treatment female stress mixed urinary incontinence , therefore , recommend first-line therapy ( Dumoulin et al , 2014 ; BÃ¸ , 2012 ) . As recommended International Consultation Incontinence ( ICI ) PFM train generally first step treatment surgery ( Abrams et al , 2010 ) . However , standard SUI physiotherapy concentrate voluntary contraction even though situation provoke SUI sneezing , cough , jump run ( Haylen et al , 2010 ) require involuntary fast reflexive pelvic floor muscle contraction . Although training procedure follow concept train science sport medicine generally well know widely implement rehabilitation sport ( ACSM , 2009 ; Schmidtbleicher &amp; Gollhofer , 1991 ) , optimal , well standardized training protocol involuntary , fast , reflexive PFM contraction still remain unknown . Consequently , research group develop standardized therapy program , include standard therapy additionally focus involuntary fast reflexive PFM contraction . The additional exercise well know apply physiotherapy , however yet regard SUI . Therefore , aim present study compare two different physiotherapy program woman suffer SUI . Both program include standard physiotherapy . Both follow concept train science ( periodization/ exercise sequence training specific muscle strength component ) . One program focus voluntary fast contraction ( standard physiotherapy ; control group ) , one focus involuntary fast reflexive PFM contraction ( experimental group ) .</detailed_description>
