	<brief_summary>Critically ill patient mechanically ventilate may require prolonged administration sedatives analgesic . Their prolonged use associate withdrawal symptom upon rapid wean critically ill patient . These withdrawal symptom may associate adverse clinical outcome . Although well study paediatric population , little known epidemiology , risk factor optimal screen method adult . Studying problem essential strive develop proper weaning strategy . Methods : Prospective observational two-center study critically ill adult patient Objectives : 1 ) Describe incidence iatrogenic withdrawal sedatives analgesic critically ill adult patient 2 ) Evaluate performance screening tool assess withdrawal develop paediatric patient adult population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Opioids Withdrawal Syndrome Critically Ill Patients : Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study : 1 ) describe incidence iatrogenic withdrawal sedative analgesic critically ill adult patient ; 2 ) Validate screening tool withdrawal adult population . Hypothesis 1 . Symptoms iatrogenic benzodiazepine opioids withdrawal occur commonly mechanically ventilated patient expose high dos and/or prolonged infusion rapidly wean therapy . 2 . The scale benzodiazepine narcotic withdrawal detection use paediatrics population correlate well DSM V diagnosis withdrawal adult ICU population 3 . Major risk factor withdrawal symptom include long duration therapy high dos admission medical condition ( MICU ) Methods A prospective multicenter observational study carry two University-affiliated hospital intensive care unit ( Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur Montreal General Hospital ) . All mechanically ventilate ICU patient receive continuous infusion benzodiazepine and/or opioids 96 hour prospectively screen daily withdrawal symptom intensivist . Withdrawal symptom opioid benzodiazepine identify use DSM-V criterion . Patients moderate severe head trauma , severe neurological disease , prior admission substance abuse ( significant alcohol , illicit prescription drug ) exclude . We also exclude patient regularly prescribe chronic opioid benzodiazepine use prior ICU admission . Risk factor withdrawal include type agent expose , dose , duration exposure , wean agent , organ dysfunction , age , gender , smoking , severity disease admission diagnosis prospectively collect . The Withdrawal Assessment Tool-1 ( WAT-1 ) , screen tool validate paediatric population , also administer daily . The criterion validity screen tool compare DSM-V criterion .</detailed_description>
