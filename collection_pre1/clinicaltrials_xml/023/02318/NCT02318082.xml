	<brief_summary>This research study way gain new knowledge treatment cGVHD respond steroid . This research study evaluate drug call Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) possible treatment cGVHD . In Phase I study , investigator look see 8- week individual patient dose- escalate IL-2 therapy cGVHD safe effect immune cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Individual Adult Pediatric Patient Dose-escalated Interleukin-2 Therapy Refractory Chronic Graft-versus-Host-Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational intervention also try define appropriate dose investigational intervention use study . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve IL-2 treatment cGVHD approve metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( MCC ) , metastatic melanoma . Chronic GVHD medical condition may occur participant receive bone marrow , stem cell cord blood transplant . The donor 's immune system may recognize participant 's body ( host ) foreign attempt 'reject ' . This process know graft-versus-host-disease . Traditional standard therapy treat cGVHD prednisone ( steroid ) . Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) natural protein involve regulation white blood cell ( WBCs ) . WBCs part immune system.The investigator look see whether IL-2 help control chronic GVHD stop donor 's immune system 'rejecting ' participant 's body . This study look see increase dose level study drug every two week administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant cGVHD . Depending well tolerate initial dose level subsequent dose level , study drug dose level may increase maximum two time . These increase dose level occur two week apart . All participant study start dose level . Study Drug : You administer , someone else administer unable , IL-2 injection skin . You rotate injection site , possible . You every day 8- week . During first 8 week IL-2 , continue take steroid immune suppress medication without change dose doctor set IL-2 . After 8 week I L-2 therapy , doctor may reduce amount steroid take . If cGVHD improve 8 week dose-escalated IL-2 , may option continue extended duration therapy . Extended duration therapy daily IL-2 treatment start end week 8 . You re-assessed every 6 month extend duration IL-2 determine IL-2 therapy continue , discretion treat physician . Drug Diary : Each day first 8 week take IL-2 day extended-duration IL-2 ( applicable ) ; ask document drug diary take drug inject . The diary also ask entire syringe inject , issue relate IL-2 . You ask return drug diary clinic every 2 week first 8 week IL-2 least every 8 week extend duration IL-2 . Chronic GVHD Assessments : While study , member study team examine evaluate cGVHD . These assessment may include examination skin , joints/muscles , eye , mouth , lung , gastrointestinal system ( example , whether experienced nausea , vomit , diarrhea , difficulty swallow ) . The investigator also look range motion different body part ( example , arm ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Recipient 78/8 HLAmatched ( HLAA , B , C , DRB1 ) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Participants must steroidrefractory cGVHD despite use 2 agent . Steroidrefractory cGVHD define persistent sign symptom cGVHD ( Appendix C , D ) despite use prednisone ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day ( 0.5 mg/kg every day ) least 4 week ( equivalent dose alternate glucocorticoid ) without complete resolution sign symptom . Participants either extensive limited chronic GVHD require systemic therapy eligible . Stable dose glucocorticoid 4 week prior enrollment . No addition subtraction immunosuppressive medication ( e.g. , calcineurininhibitors , sirolimus , mycophenolatemofetil ) 4 week prior enrollment . The dose immunosuppressive medicine may adjust base therapeutic range drug . Participants must adequate organ function define : Hepatic : Adequate hepatic function ( total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dlexception permit participant Gilbert 's Syndrome ; AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2x institutional ULN ) , unless hepatic dysfunction manifestation presume cGVHD . For participant abnormal LFTs sole manifestation cGVHD , document GVHD liver biopsy require prior enrollment . Abnormal LFTs context active cGVHD involve organ system may also permit treat physician document abnormal LFTs consistent hepatic cGVHD , liver biopsy mandate situation . Pulmonary : FEV1 ≥ 50 % DLCO ( Hb ) ≥ 40 % predict , unless pulmonary dysfunction deem due chronic GVHD . Renal : Serum creatinine ≤ institutional ULN creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . Pediatric patient must creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 regardless serum creatinine level . Adequate bone marrow function indicate absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1000/mcL platelet ≥ 50,000/mcL without growth factor transfusion Cardiac : No myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment NYHA Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , ECG abnormality screen must document investigator medically relevant . Karnofsky/Lansky performance status ≥ 60 % ( Appendix A ) Age ≥ 2 year . In institutional experience accord publish report , incidence cGVHD child age less 2 year rare . 41 Daily SC injection lowdose IL2 use pediatric postHSCT patient young 2 year . 39 Prolonged daily SC injection drug low molecular weight heparin insulin commonly administer well tolerated young pediatric population use Insuflon® indwell SC catheter . The use Insuflon® indwell SC catheter IL2 administration require pediatric patient use depend preference patient provider The effect IL2 develop human fetus unknown . For reason chemotherapeutic agent know teratogenic , participant childbearing childfathering potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should female become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Males treat enrolled protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion IL2 administration . Ability understand and/or willingness participant parent/legally authorize representative sign write informed consent document . Participants ongoing prednisone ( equivalent ) dose requirement &gt; 1 mg/kg/day ( equivalent ) . Participants concurrent use calcineurininhibitor plus sirolimus ( either agent alone acceptable ) . Participants new immunosuppressive medication , extracorporeal photopheresis rituximab therapy initiate 4 week prior . Participant posttransplant exposure donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) , Tcell IL2 target medication ( e.g . ATG , alemtuzumab , basiliximab , denileukin diftitox ) within 100 day prior . Other investigational drug within 4 week prior enrollment , unless clear Principal Investigator . Previous fixeddose IL2 therapy discontinue prior 4 week permit . Participants active malignant relapse recrudescence prior hematologic disorder . Participants inability comply IL2 treatment regimen . Organ transplant ( allograft ) recipient . HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction agent use allogeneic HSCT . In addition , individual increase risk lethal infection . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . History severe allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition IL2 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Individuals active uncontrolled hepatitis B C ineligible high risk lethal treatmentrelated hepatotoxicity HSCT . Pregnant woman exclude study potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother , breastfeed discontinue .</criteria>
