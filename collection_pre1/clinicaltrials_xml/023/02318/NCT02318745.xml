	<detailed_description>DESIGN AND METHODS . Overview . The first phase propose study include minor adaptation manual enhance `` fit '' specific characteristic target population , finalize assessment measure , finalize list CTAU agency referral mechanism , conduct therapist train CIFTA condition assessor/interviewer training , strengthen connection referral source ( month 1- 5 ) . The team experience activity previous treatment development clinical trial project . Immediately follow phase , investigator begin recruit adolescent ( 11-14 year age ) meet DSM-IV criterion two follow diagnosis ( CD , DD , ADD ) OR DSM-IV criterion one diagnosis ( CD , DD , ADD ) severe family conflict . Following screening , consent assessment , adolescent family randomly assign either ( 1 ) Community Treatment Usual Agency , ( 2 ) Culturally Informed Family Therapy Adolescents . Assessments conduct baseline ( T1 ) , post-treatment ( T2- 4 month ) , follow-up 1 ( T3- 12 month post baseline ) follow-up 2 ( T4- 20 month post baseline ) . Data service utilization self-reports therapeutic alliance also collect throughout entire course therapy . Longitudinal data analysis ( growth curve model ) use test study hypothesis . Each specific component procedure describe detail . Design Manualization Refinements . The investigator clinical team experience manualizing key treatment component . Although relatively minor , specific refinement investigator propose , base prior experience CIFTA include : 1 ) revise parent training module developmentally appropriate middle school age , 2 ) establishment healthy social activity shape selection prosocial peer group activity tie deviant peer crystallize , 3 ) creation family session material facilitate parent-child discussion country culture origin help explore question child 's ethnic identity . Manual Refinement meeting include counselor investigator hold clarify precise nature new material deliver , therapeutic process procedure optimal delivery material , interaction intervention intervention component . New manual entries/clarifications write together meet language recommend approved clinician investigator . The investigator utilize method treatment development effort investigator find leads language user-friendly clinician . The team also agree adherence checklist item reflect nature intervention . Therapist Selection , Training Supervision . Two therapist ( .3 FTE ) deliver CIFTA intervention . These therapist primarily select Center Family Studies , cadre therapist extensive experience Hispanic youngster experience deliver manualized treatment within clinical research context .

The first phase train consist 3-day training workshop include use didactic material , treatment manual , presentation videotape session pilot work . The second phase include intervention implementation 1 pilot case . A therapist require work pilot case least one-month certified condition . The guideline certification investigator use similar propose Carroll ( 1998 ) focus implementation key aspect revise CIFTA treatment ( parent , skill module , cultural module , etc ) . Key aspect therapy receive poor rating require retrain . Interventions deliver one month , briefer period typical actual intervention trial , sufficient ensure comfort competence key treatment component . There 2 day workshop follow pilot phase solidify issue remain incorporate manual clarification assist achieve high level competence fidelity/adherence . The PI extensive experience workshop trainer family-oriented substance abuse intervention . Therapist Supervision Adherence Monitoring . Weekly clinical meeting hold CIFTA therapist . Dr. Santisteban supervise team provide formal supervision project team member . All session videotape review . The clinical complexity case discuss good culturally-competent clinical implementation emphasize . Adherence raters train use establish adherence checklist two study condition . The condition supervisor hold gold-standard inter-rater reliability adherence rating raters train achieve intra-class correlation coefficient .70 high , least 80 % agreement across item . Inter-rater reliability check regularly avoid drift . Specifically , independent adherence rater randomly select 10 % video-taped session condition different treatment phase ( early , mid , late ) adherence rating . These rating document adequacy treatment session follow specific manual intervention treatment strategy . Ratings fall adequacy dimension/component trigger increase supervision focus dimension necessary , re-training . Participants randomize trial . 200 11-14 year old Hispanic youngster meet DSM-IV criterion multiple child disorder ( include CD , ADHD , DD [ depressive disorder } ) include study along family .
