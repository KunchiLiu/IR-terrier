	<brief_summary>Fungal infection could play role chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient 's exacerbation lung function impairment . In fact , Aspergillus fumigatus often isolated respiratory sample , data available clinical significance . Aspergillus colonization could associate high risk invasive pulmonary aspergillosis ( IPA ) , , COPD patient , characterize 2 % incidence ( probably underestimate ) high mortality ( 72 95 % ) . Similarly , detection anti-Aspergillus antibody quite frequent COPD patient significance usefulness aspergillosis diagnosis follow-up assess . Furthermore , several study suggest frequent carriage Pneumocystis jirovecii , reach 37-55 % , high frequency severe COPD stage possible role colonisation occurrence progression COPD . As colonization sensitization phenomenon could relate domestic exposure airborne , P. jirovecii , human reservoir , investigator set-up study order ( ) Evaluate domestic exposure mould P. jirovecii could impact fungal colonization sensitization frequency COPD patient , ( ii ) Study relationship fungal colonization/sensitization phenomenon lung function impairment course COPD ( iii ) Have good understanding mould P. jirovecii circulation close environment patient ( airborne , human reservoir patient ) . In fine , study provide data ( ) On fungal contamination level ( specie conidia concentration ) COPD patient 's home French region , ( ii ) On relationship fungal exposure level colonization/sensitization phenomenon , ( iii ) On role fungal colonization/sensitization lung function impairment , ( iv ) To design diagnostic , therapeutic , preventive option management COPD patient , take account fungal environmental exposure colonization/sensitization impact evolution disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Impact Fungal Domestic Environmental Exposure COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator focus patient domestic environment . More precisely , 80 patient , investigator measure mould domestic exposure ( determination mould frequency environmental investigation patient 's home ) , search mould sensitization colonization ( complete bio clinical check-up include spirometry , inflammatory mycological marker inclusion ) , clinical follow-up exacerbation 's ( frequency severity ) . At last , clinical environmental mould P. jirovecii isolates characterize phenotypic genotypic level .</detailed_description>
