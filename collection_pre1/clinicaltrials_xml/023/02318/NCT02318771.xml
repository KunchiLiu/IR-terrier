	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial study radiation therapy MK-3475 treat patient head neck cancer , kidney cancer , melanoma , lung cancer return , spread part body , remove surgery . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , MK-3475 , may block tumor growth target certain cell cause immune system attack tumor . Studying effect MK-3475 radiation therapy body may help doctor learn whether may effective treatment solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy MK-3475 Patients With Recurrent/Metastatic Head Neck Cancer , Renal Cell Cancer , Melanoma , Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate immunomodulatory activity radiation therapy ( RT ) RT combination anti-programmed cell death 1 ( PD ) -1 antibody ( MK-3475 ) patient recurrent/metastatic head neck cancer , renal cell cancer , melanoma lung cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore whether programmed cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression associate treatment response combination RT PD-1 blockade renal cell cancer ( RCC ) , head neck cancer ( HNC ) , lung cancer melanoma . II . To explore whether circulate tumor cell use determine PD-L1 expression . III . To explore immune-related biomarker change RT : soluble PD-L1 , cytokines etc . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM A1 : Patients undergo radiation therapy day 1 per standard care undergo biopsy 3-10 day later . Beginning 0-7 day biopsy , patient receive MK-3475 intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses MK-3475 repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM A2 : Patients undergo radiation therapy day 1-5 undergo biopsy 3-10 day later . Beginning 0-7 day biopsy , patient receive MK-3475 Arm A1 . ARM B1 : Patients receive one dose MK-3475 IV 30 minute day 1 undergo 1 fraction RT . Patients receive MK-3475 IV 30 minute absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B2 : Patients receive MK-3475 Arm B1 undergo 5 fraction RT . After completion study treatment , patient follow approximately 30 day every 8 week .</detailed_description>

In addition index lesion , ≥ 1 measurable lesion ( ) . 5 . Have performance status ≤ 1 ECOG Performance Scale . 6 . Demonstrate adequate organ function define following : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /mcL Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ≥5.6 mmol/L Serum creatinine OR Measured calculate creatinine clearance ( GFR also use place creatinine CrCl ) ≤1.8 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR ≥50 mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.8 X institutional ULN Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN subject liver metastasis 7 . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy test . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . 8 . Female subject childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication ( Reference Section 5.7.2 ) . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . 9 . Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . 1 . Is currently participate participate study investigational agent use investigational device within 2 week radiation therapy . 2 . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior radiation therapy . 3 . Has prior monoclonal antibody within 4 week prior radiation therapy recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 4 . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior radiation therapy recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Prior radiation therapy necessary excludes patient . The index lesion may acceptable stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) determine radiation oncologist . Note : If one symptomatic lesion , patient exclude lesion ca n't encompass within one radiation portal . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . 5 .
