	<brief_title>Early Mobilization After Achilles Tendon Rupture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients acute Achilles tendon rupture screen eligibility Karolinska University Hospital Södersjukhuset , Stockholm . One hundred-fifty patient include enrolled assign intervention either third party nurse research nurse . Randomisation perform use computer-generated random number permute block four , independent software specialist , consecutively number , seal , opaque envelope open surgery prior treatment . The patient randomize undergo either treatment usual use plaster cast treatment alone direct post-operative functional mobilization weight-bearing orthosis adjustable range motion ankle . The endpoint first part study tendon heal quantify 2 week microdialysis follow quantification marker tendon repair . The sample size outcome microdialysis study calculate difference glutamate metabolite 12 µM two group . For power analysis , use glutamate standard difference 15 µM result previous study . It determine sample size 25 patient per group would necessary detect glutamate difference 80 % power alpha set equal 5 % . Anticipating would lose 10 % participant enrol , plan enroll 27 patient group microdialysis .</detailed_description>
