	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Folic Acid Supplementation Adolescent Epileptics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific background , significance impact value project : Homocysteine thiol‑containing amino acid form intermediate product methionine metabolism . Re-methylation pathway recycles Homocysteine back methionine require vitamin B12 folic acid cofactor . [ 1 ] The concentration circulate total homocysteine sensitive marker inadequate folate vitamin B12 status . Elevated homocysteine concentration associate increase risk cardiovascular ( CV ) disease . [ 2 ] The total homocysteine level low child increase age high male sex . [ 2 ] The cutoff homocysteine level adolescent range 4.3 9.9 µmol/l , hyperhomocysteinemia define homocysteine &gt; 10.9 µmol/l . [ 3 ] Lower folate high homocysteine concentration may put adolescent AEDs special risk atherosclerosis adulthood . [ 4 ] This demand early intervention Asian Indian adolescent genetically expose cadiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk , AED therapy additional risk develop future CVDs . Adolescent epileptic AED take long time , homocysteine elevation get epileptogenic potential cause risk develop refractory epilepsy . [ 5 ] Literature search reveals several study depict role vitamin B12 regulation blood homocysteine level . [ 6 , 7 ] However , study confirm role folic acid supplementation hyperhomocysteinemia relate CV diseases few scarce AEDs induce hyperhomocysteinemia . Few study report negative correlation hyperhomocysteinemia low folic acid level patient AEDs . [ 8 ] At time study report effectiveness folic acid supplementation normalize homocysteine level . [ 9 ] Considering result various study many doctor prescribe folic acid along AEDs , although scarcity data India . In context , present study plan study effect folic acid supplementation homocysteine level CV risk factor BP lipid adolescent epileptic take AEDs .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosed epileptic patient either sex age 1019 yr ( &lt; 19yrs ) , come medicine Out Patient /In Patient Departments undergo AED therapy 6 month . Epileptics high homocysteine level i.e . &gt; 10.9 µmol/L ( Normal homocysteine level 4.39.9 µmol/L male 3.37.2 µmol/L female adolescent high homocysteine concentration deaned least 11.4 µmol/L male least 10.4 µmol/L female . Gender mean high homocysteine concentration 10.9 µmol/L ) [ 5 ] Pregnancy lactation Patients diabetes , Ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) , stroke , malignancy psychiatric disease exclude study . The patient receive vitamin supplement clinical evidence acute illness , renal dysfunction , thyroid dysfunction , chronic inflammatory disease , inborn error homocysteine , cobalamin folate metabolism , condition know interfere homocysteine metabolism exclude Patients already involved trial . Patients willing fill consent/ assent form also exclude study .</criteria>
