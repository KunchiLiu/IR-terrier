	<criteria>Patients must &gt; 15 &lt; 40 year age time study entry Patients must histologically confirm solid tumor malignancy either original diagnosis relapse curative therapy exists . Patients primary brain tumor , brain metastasis time potential enrollment , exclude Patients must either measurable evaluable disease Performance Level : ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) . Note : Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose assess performance score Prior Therapy : No limit place number prior therapy . Prior treatment irinotecan eribulin allow , although patient must receive coadministration eribulin irinotecan must disease progression receive either eribulin irinotecan . Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : Must receive within three week start date protocol chemotherapy ; six week require administration nitrosourea agent Hematopoietic growth factor : At least 7 day since completion therapy growth factor least 14 day longacting growth factor ( e.g . pegfilgrastim ) Biologic ( antineoplastic agent ) : At least 7 day since completion therapy biologic agent . For agent know adverse event occur beyond 7 day administration , period must extend beyond time adverse event know occur . The duration interval must discuss PI study Immunotherapy : At least 6 week since completion type immunotherapy ( e.g . tumor vaccine ) Monoclonal antibody : At least 3 halflives must elapse since prior therapy include monoclonal antibody Radiotherapy : ≥ 2 week local palliative XRT ( small port ) ; ≥ 6 month must elapse prior TBI , craniospinal XRT ; ≥ 3 month must elapse ≥ 50 % radiation pelvis ; ≥ 6 week must elapse therapeutic dos MIBG substantial BM irradiation give Stem Cell Transplant Rescue without TBI : No evidence active graft vs. host disease ≥ 2 month must elapse Organ Function Requirements : Patients must normal organ marrow function define Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL ( transfusion independent , define receive platelet transfusion within 7day period prior enrollment ) Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl ( may receive RBC transfusion ) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit normal age AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 × institutional upper limit normal Albumin ≥ 2 g/dl Creatinine within normal institutional limit age OR creatinine clearance ≥ 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Contraception : Because chemotherapeutic agent may teratogenic , male female childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation 4 month last dose study chemotherapy All patient &gt; 18 year must sign write informed consent . Patients &lt; 18 year old must sign assent document , parent legal guardian must sign write informed consent Pregnancy BreastFeeding : Patients pregnant breastfeed eligible study due potential fetal teratogenic toxicity . Negative pregnancy test must obtain female patient postmenarchal Concomitant Medications : Growth factor ( ) : Growth factor support platelet white cell number function must administer within 7 day prior enrollment ( 14 day pegfilgrastim ) Corticosteroids : Patients receive corticosteroid stable decrease dose corticosteroid 7 day prior enrollment eligible Investigational Drugs : Patients currently receive another investigational drug eligible Anticancer Agents : Patients currently receive anticancer agent eligible Enzymeinducing anticonvulsant medication : Patients currently receive enzyme induce anticonvulsant : phenytoin , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine eligible . Patients currently take rifampin , voriconazole , itraconazole , ketoconazole , aprepitant , St. John 's Wort eligible Anticoagulants : Use warfarin allow study . Patients already warfarin use alternative anticoagulant study . Warfarin must administer within 7 day start protocol therapy Infection : Patients uncontrolled infection , currently receive treatment C difficile infection Patients history allergic reaction attribute eribulin irinotecan Patients document allergy cephalosporin Patients CNS tumor know brain metastasis Patients know metastatic tumor bone marrow Patients opinion investigator may able comply safety monitoring requirement study Uncontrolled intercurrent illness would limit compliance study requirement HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction eribulin irinotecan . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy</criteria>
