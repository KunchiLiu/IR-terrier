	<brief_summary>Myocardial infarction angiographically normal coronary artery ( MINCA ) common ( 7-8 % myocardial infarction ) . There several different cause behind MINCA `` true infarction '' due thromboembolism , myocarditis Takotsubo stress cardiomyopathy main finding . The underlying diagnosis often make clinical finding sometimes help cardiac MRI ( CMR ) . Investigators previously show possible give 50 % patient diagnosis make combination clinical finding CMR make median 12 day acute event . The present study aim improve diagnostic accuracy early CMR late technique .</brief_summary>
