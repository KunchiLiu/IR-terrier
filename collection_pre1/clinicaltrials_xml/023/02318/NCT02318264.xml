	<brief_title>Influence Elastic Tape Activation Quadriceps Muscle During Selected Resisted Weight Bearing Exercises</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : This cross design study use determine influence elastic kinesiology tape speed amplitude quadriceps activation ( anterior thigh ) select resisted weight bearing exercise . Background : Compliant tape , Kiniseoâ“‡ Tape ( KT ) , highly elastic claim manufacturer mimic skin . It commonly use physical therapist sport medicine practitioner treat musculoskeletal condition enhance physical performance . The creator KT teach variety application technique affect underlying musculature . Current theory regard elastic tape application suggest tape applied muscle proximal distal attachment , facilitate underlying muscle apply tape distal proximal inhibit musculature.1 While study investigate effect elastic tape muscle activation , study date compare direction application muscle activation.2-7 Methods Measures : Healthy subject 18-35 year old recruit Upstate Medical University community via email word mouth . Potential participant report Institute Human Performance ask complete documentation include informed consent health-screening questionnaire . If eligible , qualified participant perform 2 functional jumping exercise ( vertical jump single-leg triple hop distance ) 8 isokinetic knee flexion extension 60 degrees/sec 120 degrees/sec use Biodex System 3 Pro Dynamometer ( Biodex Medical Systems , Shirley , NY ) . The Biodex isokinetic machine show reliable valid source measure peak torque , position velocity.9 Surface electromyography ( EMG ) recording collect vastus medialis vastus lateralis isokinetic testing . Testing occur four session . In first session , baseline measurement measurement immediately KT application collect . In second session , participant retested wear KT two day ( 48 hour ) . This process repeat one week later session three four KT apply opposite direction initial test condition . KT application direction order activity randomize participant .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire ( PARQ ) ( British Columbia Ministry Health ) use general screen exercise safety . Additionally , researcher ask participant identify possible cardiovascular and/or orthopedic risk resistance exercise , dominant leg injuries/surgeries , regard history familiarity elastic tape . Subjects risk due recent ( within last year ) musculoskeletal injury low extremity exclude study . Additionally , exclude subject report significant respiratorycardiovascular disease , subject history surgery dominant leg , individual train elastic tape theory application . Any participant know allergy adhesive also exclude study . Blood pressure heart rate measure start session . Per ACSM 's guideline exercise testing , participant 's rest systolic blood pressure great &gt; 200 mm Hg diastolic BP &gt; 110 mm Hg he/she exclude exercise testing study</criteria>
