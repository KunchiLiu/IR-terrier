	<brief_summary>Adequate control immunosuppression critical preventing graft failure solid organ transplantation ( SOT ) avoid life-threatening viral malignant complication . Prolonging patient graft survival delay re-transplantation child reach adulthood critical optimal use scarce resource . This require tailor post-transplant management unique need child . Immunosuppression management challenge infant , child youth . The interval birth young adulthood see profound change physiological process , body size immune maturation ; infancy adolescence period rapid dramatic change . Three pivotal factor affect immunosuppression control child : 1 ) age-dependent variation drug metabolism ; 2 ) developmental change immune function increase childhood susceptibility infection , include caused virus ; 3 ) behavioural change adolescence young adulthood link poor treatment adherence . This project identify important factor influence immunosuppression control across pediatric age range , infancy young adulthood , include age-related change drug metabolism , immune function , susceptibility viral infection , well health care system factor affect treatment adherence . This first comprehensive , multi-organ transplant study identify age-related biologic health care system determinant variability immunosuppression control child youth . Results inform personalized age-appropriate strategy improve immunosuppression control reduce unacceptably high graft failure viral complication rate vulnerable population . The POSITIVE Study bring together researcher across Canada one 6 project 3 core constitute Canadian Institute Health Research ( CIHR ) fund interdisciplinary research program call Canadian National Transplant Research Program ( CNTRP ) . The CNTRP national program design increase organ tissue donation Canada enhance survival quality life Canadians receive transplant . As national program , CNTRP provide robust power pediatric study would otherwise possible . While primarily focus issue unique pediatric young adult population , study interact closely CNTRP project . These reciprocal interaction accelerate new discovery cross-applied different population outside pre-specified age group . Interactions ensure rapid knowledge transfer , uptake dissemination practice . This large national cohort study pediatric transplant patient date Canada , create longitudinal dataset clinical biological specimen linkable transplant registry provincial administrative datasets .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective project analyze physiological factor impact immune response effect immunosuppression across different pediatric age group , develop age-appropriate medical health care strategy improve graft survival reduce complication pediatric young adult population . There 3 primary aim study : Aim 1 : Develop age-appropriate calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) dose pediatric SOT patient : We hypothesize physiologically-based ( PB ) model enable personalize CNI dose infant , child youth base age , pharmacogenotype immune maturity . Aim 1 deliverable include 1 ) personalize physiologically-based CNI dose algorithm SOT ; 2 ) validation pediatric sensitive immunosuppression monitoring tool therapeutic target ; 3 ) validation immunologic assay assess age-specific immune response . We anticipate personalize CNI dose result early attainment maintenance therapeutic drug concentration , reduce frequency out-of-range concentration post-transplant , improve safety efficacy immunosuppression , reduce dependence therapeutic drug monitoring guide drug dosing . Standardized assessment immune function may also monitor immunosuppression reliably eventually reduce need invasive monitoring like biopsy . Aim 2 : Develop risk prediction tool base viral-host interaction predispose young SOT hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient Epstein-Barr virus disorders/post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( EBV disorders/PTLD ) : We hypothesize susceptibility EBV disorders/PTLD influence interaction high-risk EBV subtypes host factor like age , immune maturation intensity immunosuppression . In context , `` EBV disorder '' refers non-malignant EBV disease well sustain elevation viral load absence PTLD . We identify high-risk viral subtypes age-related difference host immunity interact increase susceptibility EBV disorders/PTLD young patient . Important clinical application : 1 ) knowledge host susceptibility factor ( age immune maturation ) time transplant may assist choice less intensive immunosuppression reduce risk develop EBV ( e.g. , avoidance T cell depletion therapy , primary prevention ) promote use EBV prophylaxis risk patient ( secondary prevention ) ; 2 ) EBV genotype panel develop clinical tool detect high risk subtypes patient EBV . This help identify patient expose EBV receive aggressive therapy EBV and/or PTLD ( personalize therapy ) . This innovative risk stratification enable personalized immunosuppression strategy strategies prevent treat EBV/PTLD . Aim 3 : Develop health care system strategy enhance medication adherence adolescent young adult : Medication adherence determine factor variety different `` level '' : patient-level ( patient- , condition- , therapy-related factor ) , `` micro '' -level ( social factor interaction care team ) , `` meso '' -level ( organization expertise healthcare team care process ) , `` macro '' -level ( high-level healthcare system factor , include care medication cost coverage , overall care environment ) . We hypothesize significant difference modifiable meso- macro-level system factor pediatric program , adult program , pediatric adult program . Furthermore , hypothesize modifiable meso- macro-level system factor independently associate medication adherence . This aim two primary objective : Objective 1 : To characterize difference Canadian solid organ transplant program potentially modifiable meso- macro-level system factor . Objective 2 : To identify potentially modifiable meso- macro-level factor determinant adherence , adjust potential confounders .</detailed_description>
