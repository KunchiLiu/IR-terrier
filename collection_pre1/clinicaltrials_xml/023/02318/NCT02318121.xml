	<brief_summary>Prolonged labour cause maternal mortality morbidity perinatal mortality morbidity . Prolonged labour often define onset regular , rhythmical painful contraction accompany cervical dilatation labour longer 24 hours.prolonged active phase last long 12 hour without full assessment facility able offer management treatment complications.Causes prolong labour usually due poor uncoordinated uterine action , fetal head malposition , abnormal pelvis either due bone soft tissue obstruction . Arrested prolonged labor frequent indication cesarean delivery.Prolonged labor also associate increased pain negative birth experience . Women prolong first stage labor experience high rate postpartum hemorrhage , chorioamnionitis neonatal admission intensive care unit . Caesarean section rate 20 % many developed country increase nearly four-fold relative 5 % rate observe early 1970s . The main diagnosis contribute increase dystocia prolong labor.Data obtain local hospital record show Caesarean section rate Assiut University Women 's Health Hospital 47.96 % 2013 . Dystocia term use delay labor progress usually refer abnormally slow cervical dilatation.It propose partogram include , diagnostic criterion , 1 cm/hour line originate admission . The World Health Organization propose modify partogram recommends active phase diagnose 4 cm . Oxytocin augmentation uterine contraction without amniotomy widely use modern obstetric practice treat slow labour , although time oxytocin initiation amniotomy may vary widely.This intervention base hypothesis frequent cause dystocia inadequate uterine contraction . The mechanism amniotomy speed labour remains unclear think membrane rupture , production release prostaglandins oxytocin increase result strong contraction quicker cervical dilatation . I find early intervention ( augmentation versus routine care ) amniotomy oxytocin associate modest reduction risk caesarean section . Moreover , amniotomy find associate increased risk cesarean delivery compare woman without amniotomy shorten spontaneous labour . The 3 method ( Amniotomy , Oxytocin ) use augmentation labor different setting without real conclusion well .</brief_summary>
