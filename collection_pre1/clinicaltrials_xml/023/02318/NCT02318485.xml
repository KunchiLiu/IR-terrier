	<brief_summary>This project aim conduct multicentre human clinical trial effectively diagnose treat limbal stem cell deficiency ( LSCD ) cause number different disease process , common denominator , i.e . loss normal function epithelial stem cell cornea . A number different disease aniridia , steven johnson 's syndrome , ocular cicatricial pemphigoid , bacterial keratitis , chemical thermal injury cornea lead gradual loss function epithelial stem cell . This lead vascularization cornea surround conjunctival epithelium grow result scar opacification . These cornea , since vascular , long retain immune privilege prove extremely challenge ophthalmic surgeon . Grafting donor cornea normal circumstance ( non vascular cornea ) would give excellent result , exhibit high rate rejection . This frustrating patient well surgeon . Since number different contribute disease pathology , estimate approximately 100 patient per year Belgium suffer degree LSCD . These patient often correctly diagnose since relatively new disease first described 1990 discovery limbal epithelial stem cell 1989 . The low rate diagnosis could potentially increase vivo confocal scan microscopy non invasive screen test detect early sign LSCD therefore offer conservative treatment option . In case total limbal stem cell deficiency already develop , conventional corneal graft suitable due high vascularity host bed . In situation propose transplant standardize limbal epithelial stem cell graft generate patient 's ocular stem cell ( good eye , available ) HLA match donor . Tiny 1 2mm superficial limbal ( peripheral cornea ) biopsy take epithelial stem cell expand laboratory biological substrate , graft measure &gt; 8mm diameter generate 2 week period . This transplant onto diseased eye removal scar tissue use novel surgical technique develop .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Limbal Epithelial Stem Cell Transplantation : Phase II Multicenter Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project aim conduct multicenter , single-arm phase II study , assess safety efficacy transplant standardize , non-xenogenic limbal stem cell graft patient LSCD . The Good Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ) clean room facility Centre Cell Therapy Regenerative Medicine ( CCRG , UZA ) conduct tissue engineering , Departments Ophthalmology University Hospitals Antwerp ( UZA ) , Brussels ( UZB ) Gent ( UZG ) enrol patient , perform pre-operative test , harvest limbal biopsy , perform auto- allogenic graft transplantation follow-up . Based past experience phase I/II mono-centre human clinical trial , able document safety feasibility transplantation . 12/18 patient ( 2/3 allogenic 10/15 autologous ) show decrease corneal vascularization , complete epithelialization incorporation graft anterior cornea post limbal stem cell transplantation . However current result limit respect sample size , feasibility allogenic transplantation ( 3 case ) , long term follow-up ( mean 22 month , range 4-43 month ) disease monitor strategy . Longer patient follow-up determine long term success ( especially follow subsequent corneal transplant ) inclusion large allogenic patient population need address treatment translate clinic recognize RIZIV reimbursable cell therapy . It pertinent say cell base therapy potential provide orphan pathology effective treatment option . The Flemish society benefit project improve rehabilitation patient suffer corneal blindness due LSCD . By provide treatment option offer ray hope patient would formerly learn live disability . By restore vision patient possible reintegrate society socially accepted individual . Even small degree visual rehabilitation make difference . For example , slight increase visual acuity restore person 's ability drive rather rely exclusively public transportation . More independence well quality life main objective strive achieve major outcome project .</detailed_description>
