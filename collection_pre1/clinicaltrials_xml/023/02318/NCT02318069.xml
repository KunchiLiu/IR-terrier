	<detailed_description>The risk tick borne encephalitis increase Sweden . Together increase awareness possibility acquire protection vaccination , lead increase number dose vaccine distribute Sweden year - approximately 400.000 . The first year , two dos interval 1 month recommend general population , follow third dose approximately one year later additional booster dose three year third . The manufacturer Encepur recommend total three dos age group use regimen `` accelerated vaccination schedule ( 0+7+21 day ) . Unfortunately , geometrical mean titer 3 dos accelerate schedule superior 2 dos give 0+30 day The manufacturer FSME-immune instead recommend serology check one month second dose third dose give titer sufficient ( 0+30+60 day ) . Unfortunately , determination titer large number sample put severe strain logistics feasible Sweden . In order try improve immunity age group 60+ , Department Communicable Disease Control Prevention Stockholm therefore recommend third dose two month first two dos age group 60+ ( = 0+30+90 day ) . Preliminary result previous study show high percentage protect ( =titer least 10 ) 3 dos 2 dos ( Rombo et al . EUDRA CT 2011 001348-31 , unpublished information ) . In study , difference vaccinate 0+7+21 compare 0+30+90 . The investigator surprise find marked difference 2 3 dos also young control group Primary aim : To study whether difference remain one month additional dose follow season Secondary aim : To study whether additional dose TBE vaccine 2 month second dose improve protection age group 50+ . Primary endpoint : Serum concentration neutralise antibody tick borne encephalitis one month additional dose follow year Secondary endpoint : Serum concentration neutralise antibody tick borne encephalitis one month two three dos . Calculation power : Depend whether aim determine difference geometric mean titer difference seroconversion rate . The investigator prefer former settle least difference would interest . Inclusion critera : Age 50 year . Exclusion critera : previous tick borne encephalitis infection . Previously immunize tick borne encephalitis vaccine . Anaphylactic reac tion egg protein . Any disease therapy might suppress immune response . Vaccination delay participant fever . Study design . The investigator intend give FSME-immune 4 group vary vaccination schedule ( see ) 50 participant randomize Group . A young age group ( 50 participant 18-49 year ) serve control give FSME-immune accord standard recommendation ( 0+30 day ) Days 0 7 21 30 90 360 Vaccine group 1 x x x Vaccine group 2 x x x x Vaccine group 3 x x x x Vaccine group 4 xx x x Controls x x x Blood sample ( 10 ml blood ) obtain humoral response show Days 0 60 120 360 400 Group 1 x x x x x Group 2 x x x x x Group 3 x x x x x Group 4 x x x x x Controls x x x x x Analyses Samples analyse neutralise antibody Swedish institute Infectious disease control - option possible .</detailed_description>
