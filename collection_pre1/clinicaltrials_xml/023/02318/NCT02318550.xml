	<brief_title>Registry Patients MRI With Non-MRI Conditional Pacemakers ICD Non-MRI Conditional Pacemakers ICD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Registry Purpose This registry prospective single institution study MRI examination patient pacemaker ICD 's undergo MRI order routine clinical care . The purpose registry accumulate pre-and post-scan device interrogation data purpose determine risk MRI patient implantable device . Registry data add exist data safety MRI scan patient pacemaker ICDs . This safety data may impact physician ' diagnostic choice patient population . Patients condition MRI best diagnostic modality able undergo MRI scanning may able registry participation . The diagnostic information obtain scan may assist physician ' treatment decision may ultimately affect patient outcome . In addition , knowledge , previous registry MRI 's non-conditional cardiac device limit academic center . This registry would among first demonstrate feasibility safety approach community hospital setting . Study Methods The registry research involve acquire analyze data device function adverse event related MRI scan . The need MRI determine case-by-case basis base patient 's medical history treatment plan/goals , independent registry research purpose . Only patient implanted device order clinically indicate MRI scan consider registry inclusion . Clinical review perform patient consider determination image modality would appropriate . The appropriateness MRI study must discuss , person via phone call , cardiac radiologist , determine Paul Leslie , M.D. , request physician . The discussion include consideration alternative imaging modality diagnostic quality MRI imaging request body region give implanted device ( ) . The request physician responsible discuss patient and/or medical proxy reason determination , base final decision make radiologist . All patient screen prior enrollment . Any patient commercially available pacemaker ICD system implanted 2001 meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion , require medically-indicated MRI describe eligible enroll study . The presence/absence capped/abandoned/epicardial leads/subcutaneous coil confirm document review recent chest x-ray obtain . The x-ray must post-date recent device/lead intervention , determine review patient 's medical record . If MRI procedure deem absolutely necessary , MRI perform Lancaster General Hospital Lime Street MRI facility . MRI scan sequence , field intensity field ( ) exposure select minimize risk patient gain need diagnostic information diagnosis therapy management . The MRI perform 1.5 T scanner utilize institutional protocol follow setting : - Normal operate mode - SAR ≤ 2.0 W/kg per patient . Prior procedure , pacemaker technologist manufacturer clinical representative interrogate pacemaker ICD record follow parameter : - Patient 's underlying rhythm - Atrial right/left ventricular pacing threshold - P-wave R-wave amplitude - Lead impedance ( atrial , ventricular , high voltage ) - Battery voltage - Arrhythmia history - Tachyarrhythmia therapy The following pacemaker/ICD parameter deactivate duration MRI : - Magnet response ( ICD ) - Rate response - PVC response - Noise reversion response - Ventricular sense response - Mode switch - Tachycardia detection/therapies ( ICD ) - EGM trigger Patients pacemaker dependent pacemaker/ICD program AAI/VVI/DDI 40 beat per minute duration MRI . Patients pacemaker dependent ( pace program low rate pre-scan interrogation ) pacemaker/ICD program AOO/VOO/DOO program low rate duration MRI . Emergency equipment , include MRI compatible defibrillator transcutaneous pacemaker , available throughout procedure event adverse clinical event . In addition radiology staff , pacemaker technologist manufacturer clinical representative EP tech/RN current ACLS present duration procedure . An EP physician/advanced practice provider ( APP ) must immediately available ( i.e. , hospital ) provide medical intervention , placement temporary external pacemaker require . In event code call MRI staff , hospital protocol indicate ER staff respond code . Radiology staff electrophysiology ( EP ) technologist nurse current ACLS certification monitor follow patient parameter least every 5 minute throughout MRI scan : - Heart rate - Heart rhythm - Non-invasive blood pressure - Oxygen saturation - Symptoms If following adverse symptoms/events occur scan , test immediately terminate : - Burning/pulling sensation device pocket/chest MRI - Potentially lethal/previously non-diagnosed arrhythmia MRI - Spontaneous unanticipated pacing rate change - SOB - Chest pain - Feeling heat/pulling chest device pocket The patient remove scanner hold area device interrogate reprogrammed original parameter indicate interrogation . If need , emergency treatment provide per ACLS protocols discretion monitoring physician . The follow parameter compare pre-MRI result : - Patient 's underlying rhythm - Atrial right/left ventricular pacing threshold - P-wave R-wave amplitude - Lead impedance ( atrial , ventricular , high voltage ) - Battery voltage All device-related adverse events/symptoms document data collection form report IRB . The patient remain MRI suite hold area medically stable . The need treatment discretion monitoring physician . The EP physician/APP review compare pre/post MRI device data prior patient 's discharge MRI suite . Following testing , pacemaker ICD reprogrammed pre-procedure parameter . The need device reprogramming related MRI scan base clinical judgment attend electrophysiologist . Follow-up Patients experience device relate adverse event MRI return one follow-up visit 1-6 week MRI . The follow-up visit include pacemaker/ICD interrogation test confirm appropriate function . At minimum , device interrogation/testing include : - Atrial right/left ventricular pacing threshold - P-wave R-wave amplitude - Lead impedance ( atrial , ventricular , high voltage ) - Battery voltage Patients experience one device-related adverse event MRI return total three follow-up visit . The follow-up visit include pacemaker/ICD test confirm appropriate function , take place 1 7 day post MRI , 3-months post MRI , 6 month post MRI . At minimum , device interrogation/testing include : - Atrial right/left ventricular pacing threshold - P-wave R-wave amplitude - Lead impedance ( atrial , ventricular , high voltage ) - Battery voltage The result follow-up device interrogation , include whether MRI-related adverse event resolve , document keep device chart record Registry database . There charge extra follow-up visit require result MRI-induced programming change .</detailed_description>
