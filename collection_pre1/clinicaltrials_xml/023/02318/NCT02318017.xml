	<detailed_description>Research objective : To examine dynamic pattern task-evoked network connectivity ADHD patient methylphenidate IR treatment compare healthy control . Aims : 1 . To explore whether pattern network connectivity differs methylphenidate treatment . 2 . To explore whether pattern network connectivity differs ADHD patient healthy subject . Methods Subjects Total number subject : 55 age 6-18 , wide age range representation pediatric population include preschooler . The cross-over study design study best suit wide study population age range . Preschoolers include incompatibility computerize neurocognitive task . 35 child adolescent patient undergoing diagnosis treatment management ADHD use computerized cognitive task ( e.g . CPT ) without methylphenidate treatment . 20 healthy child adolescent recruit . Recruitment procedure study follow : 1 . Parents patient diagnose ADHD approach attention clinic Sheba Medical Center check whether wish participate study . It emphasize treatment follow-up clinic affect participation non-participation study . 2 . E-mail and/or phone contact make parent patient diagnose ADHD attention clinic Sheba Medical Center . Only parent confirm advance ( regardless current study ) contact e-mail / phone contact . 3 . During lecture general public , perform researcher subject ADHD , research present offer parent ADHD diagnose child participate study . Information letter sent ( study group recruitment add attach ) express interest son / daughter participation study . 4 . Recruitment participant control group - recruitment announcement healthy volunteer send use electronic medium shall accompany information letter ( control group recruitment add- attach ) . Study group Children adolescents consider methylphenidate treatment therefore refer computerized cognitive task without methylphenidate IR use part management . The recruitment patient refer attention clinic Edmond Lilly Safra child 's Hospital diagnose ADHD . Patients treated methylphenidate consideration treatment methylphenidate offer join study include study proper consent form sign parent . Clinical assessment include semi construct interview psychiatrist part regular management make . Control group Healthy child adolescent recruit sign proper consent form parent . Public publication study take place recruitment control group . ( e.g poster state main study objective , procedure subject need characteristic ) Recruitment payment Subjects ' parent pay carfare loss time . Medication : Subjects control group already use methylphenidate least 2 day medication wash prior evaluation day . Methylphenidate IR give single dose 0.5 mg/kg . Experimental design 1 . Demographic measure : General demographic questionnaire - i.e . name , gender , age , country origin , level education . 2 . Neuropsychiatric side effect assessment : 1 . The DuPaul-Berkley ADHD Rating scale - Hebrew version , use baseline session . ( Dupaul GJ 1991 ) 2 . Hebrew version schedule Affective disorder Schizophrenia school-aged Children , present lifetime ( K-SADS-PL ) ( Kaufman et al . 1997 ) . 3 . Berkley side effect rating scale ( modify Hebrew version ) administer parent methylphenidate-IR/placebo . ( Berkley RA 1988 ) 4 . The Strengths Difficulties Questionnaires ( SDQ ) - Hebrew version , use baseline session control group . ( Goodman R 1997 ) 5 . Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale ( CGI-S ) ( Guy W , 1976 ) 6 . Clinical examination include psychiatric interview assessment soft neurological sign . 3 . EEG test procedure : A 64 channel ActiveTwo Biosemi EEG system ( Biosemi Instrumentations , Amsterdam , Netherlands ) use record task-related evoked potential entire scalp . Sampling rate 1024 Hz . ActiveTwo Biosemi EEG system allow calibration change require clinical treatment use research purpose . The ActiveTwo Biosemi EEG system use outpatient inpatient clinical use Israel . In study use ActiveTwo Biosemi EEG system Weizmann institute Sheba medical center . Subjects seat comfortably chair Biosemi cap put head . The 64-scalp electrode position accord international 10-20 system . To place cap , measure distance nasion inion distance two ear situate cap electrode Cz exactly half way two ear nasion ( intersection frontal bone two nasal bone ) inion ( external occipital protuberance ) . Baseline EEG measure : Prior cognitive testing , baseline EEG record 5 minute require generate baseline network map brain connectivity . Cognitive EEG measure : Throughout cognitive testing ( detail ) , EEG record neural response data process offline . 4 . Cognitive task : 1 . Sustained attention cognitive inhibition The Sustained Attention Response Task ( SART ) : The SART require participant make frequent response non-targets withhold response rarely present target . The task simply involve sequential presentation 297 single picture ( 33 kind ) present 6min . Subjects respond key press picture , except 33 occasion designated picture appear ( refer Figure 1 ) . The response require non-target stimulus simply press mouse/keyboard , target disperse randomly sequence occur often 1 9 trial average . In SART , therefore , commission error ( failure inhibit respond target ) `` slips action '' result brief lapse sustain attention . In Random SART , target appear randomly therefore inhibition prepotent essential requirement inhibit response unpredictable . Therefore , task look ability produce 'correct ' inhibition inappropriate response ( Robertson et al. , 1997 ) . The SART 4 measurable condition : 1 . Go condition ( press require press ) 2 . Omission error ( press require press ) 3 . No-Go condition ( press require refrain press ) 4 . Commission error ( press require refrain press ) 2 . Working memory The n-back task : The n-back task examines number key process require work memory . These process include on-line monitoring , update information manipulation retention remember information . In task , participant require monitor series visual stimuli indicate currently present stimulus one present n trial ( n 0 , 1 , 2 ) previously . To begin , 0-back condition , participant require response single pre-determined target picture . In 1-back condition , target picture represent picture identical immediately precede one ( i.e. , one trial back ) . In 2-back condition , target picture represent picture identical picture present two trial back . Therefore , work memory load vary 0 2 item . 3. selective attention cognitive inhibition The Stroop color word Task : ( Stroop , 1935 ) The requirement Stroop task inhibit automatic tendency read write word perform less automatic task choose color ink word write , fast possible . The participant require identify , quickly possible , ink color Hebrew word : red , blue , green yellow , present varying color ( red , blue , green yellow ) press correct key . The name color print onto key keyboard ( red , j yellow , l blue green ) . When participant press correct key , reaction time record , next stimulus appear . Presentation word stimulus divide block , consist four block 16 congruent incongruent ( 50 % randomly ) color word stimulus . Maximum stimulus duration interstimulus duration 1,300 350 msec , respectively . The task procedure base previous study ( Peterson et al . 2009 ) . Procedural design Parents child refer clinic ADHD diagnosis management offer participate study . After parent participant sign proper consent form meeting evaluation psychiatrist schedule . If indeed ADHD diagnosis make methylphenidate treatment recommend child recruit study . The treatment design double-blind placebo control cross-over . Half patient receive methylphenidate immediate release ( IR ) first placebo half receive placebo first methylphenidate-IR randomized manner . The placebo methylphenidate-IR pill ( identical appearance ) place subject study group two case mark `` A '' `` B '' , content write RA separately decide order ( first placebo first methylphenidate-IR ) use coin flip , reveal final session questioner fill . Data analysis Data analysis make offline : - Data preprocessing artifact correction ( use EEGLAB ) : Eye-blink correction Cleaning movement Filter data • Discrete Regions Analysis ( use EEGLAB ) : Examine average ERP Use t-tests ass whether ERP differs across condition Provide map neural response cognitive task • Network analysis ( use matlab ) : Network construction ( i.e . node , coefficient cluster , small worldness ) Examine network robustness</detailed_description>
