	<brief_summary>The purpose study test effectiveness cost effectiveness assist work process redesign intervention achieve improve diabetes care primary care practice . The strategy test represent novel method assist practice develop skill overcome `` clinical inertia '' health care system barrier improve diabetes care help implement use diabetes registry identify needed clinical preventive service opportunities treatment intensification appropriate patient diabetes . This accomplished help practice develop method improve efficiency effectiveness clinical care process integration diabetes registry regular clinical practice . This integration accomplish change work process practice set ensure population health task ( outreach patient attend schedule chronic care visit systematic identification follow patient may take prescribed medication therapy ) become part regular work clinical support staff member primary care practice team .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project design test effectiveness cost-effectiveness multi-faceted largely self-directed organizational change intervention implementation use diabetes registry primary care practice . Participating practice use diabetes care registry target evidence-based process care goal improve patient attainment recommend outcome care target HbA1c , blood pressure control lipid control . Following recruitment randomization 30 primary care practice intervention control arm , clinician champion identify practice leader attend series three meeting course intervention . At meeting , champion receive brief instruction population health concept , effective team leadership , organizational self-assessment , work process redesign use computerize registry system . In addition , champion share successes challenge face implementation process encourage share successful technique . At participate practice , clinician champion responsible intervention lead process organizational self-assessment work process redesign support implementation use diabetes care registry . During eleven-month implementation initial registry use period outside Peer Mentor make quarterly visit practice schedule monthly phone consultation local clinician champion . During visit , Peer Mentors meet practice champion advise method overcome implementation barrier related work process redesign . Peer Mentors consult work process redesign expert need . For technical computer-based barrier Peer Mentor coordinate access technical support staff member project . Practice champion meeting The intervention begin half-day training meeting representative 15 intervention practice serve `` champion '' intervention organization . Prior stage , practice champion select practice leader among clinician practice use follow criterion : clinician 1 ) principal employment practice , 2 ) authorize lead practice improvement process 3 ) regularly provide care patient diabetes . Practices may send one practice member training session ( example , member nursing clinical support staff could also attend meeting ) . However , one clinician champion identify practice ensure maintenance relatively low cost intervention . In addition , practice manager provide detailed description intervention assist champion manage need work process change . Our experience pilot study suggest half-day session deliver even acceptable primary care clinician sufficient delivery propose training content . This meeting use introduce practice champion 1 ) objective project ( include focus use registry target evidence-based process care improvements59 cost-effective preventive care60 ) , 2 ) population health concept relate diabetes care primary care practice , 3 ) principle effective team leadership , 4 ) principle patient registry construction use , 5 ) introduction free stand-alone registry software solution , 6 ) organizational self-assessment process focus plan work process change relate use registry practice , 7 ) instruction use study material coordinate change practice work process practice manager . Follow meeting hold three six month initial meeting practice champion assess progress registry implementation , reinforce learn initial meeting , share success challenge face implementation process . The goal champion foster cross-practice learn share successful technique . Peer Mentors also attend meeting . Practice self-assessment work process redesign Following initial meeting practice champion , practice initiate process organizational self-assessment work process redesign ensure effective implementation use diabetes registry . Clinician champion use self-assessment checklist design ensure part process champion focus learn 1 ) current practice system procedures relate diabetes care management control diabetes , 2 ) system procedure may affect registry use , 3 ) work process need change adapted accommodate new registry-related work ( include data entry , patient follow , visit preparation ) . Champions use tools focus redesign work process support new task . These change necessarily specific participate practice tailor skill available staff member . Peer Mentor activity The Peer Mentors focus assist practice champion address implementation use hurdle specific practice . This assistance limit advisory role focus reinforce need practice champion anticipate plan work process change , encourage development use effective team leadership technique , assist address technical issue regard installation use registry program . Peer Mentors visit participate practice quarterly basis monthly phone conference practice champion throughout 12-month intervention period . Delayed intervention Based initial finding evaluation intervention deliver baseline , adjust intervention focus activity initial intervention find helpful successful implementation use diabetes registry . This modify intervention deliver , use crossover design , initial control practice . Since project timeline allow long-term follow practice compare effectiveness initial delay intervention compare effect patient outcomes observe first post-intervention assessment initial intervention practice effect patient outcomes collect final observation period delay intervention practice . Medical record review To assess effect intervention quality diabetes care deliver participate practice , audit medical record 100 randomly select patient diabetes practice . The quality diabetes care assessed 100 patient practice baseline , year 3 follow initial intervention year 5 follow delivery delay intervention control practice total 3000 medical record assessment period .</detailed_description>
