	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES I ( ) To analyze depth current quality intrapartum care mixed method approach , include exploration underlying challenge care delivery association suboptimal labour care perinatal mortality . ( b ) To conduct criterion-based audit stillbirth investigate direct indirect cause related maternal risk . II . To develop locally achievable agree partogram-associated labour monitoring-to-action guideline ( PartoMa guideline ) strengthen partogram use decision support tool , study acceptability skilled birth attendant . III . To implement PartoMa guideline low cost , low dose , high frequency , in-house training strengthen use partogram decision support tool , study effect knowledge , skill , quality intrapartum care , record keep , perinatal outcome . IV . On top PartoMa guideline continual training package , implement low tech intrapartum triage system base PartoMa guideline ' colour code study effect timely intrapartum surveillance action labour . V. To develop evaluate eHealth solution , base intervention , assist skilled birth attendant improve monitoring-to-action labour . VI . To estimate cost-effectiveness intervention study ( specific objectives III-V ) . SETTING The East African Mnazi Mmoja Hospital ( MMH ) Zanzibar governmental referral facility serve population Zanzibar . As East Africa general , Zanzibarian archipelago struggle poverty resource constraint health system , half population live basic need poverty line . At facility 's Department Obstetrics Gynecology , yearly number delivery approximately 13,000 , number rise . During past four year , approximately 50 maternal death occur department yearly . In period , yearly stillbirth rate show tendency increase . In 2013 , 480 stillbirth estimate 157 neonatal death occur Department . Maternal perinatal death audit conduct routinely little known direct indirect cause perinatal death . METHODS This study present stepwise quality improvement process intrapartum monitoring , action triage . The effect step evaluate continual register-based assessment outcome , criterion-based audit intrapartum care , knowledge staff , qualitative exploration . The overall study design present relation four specific objective : I . The intervention-based study base in-depth baseline quality care assessment , include follow : a. Maternal death enquiry ; b. Criterion-based audit intrapartum management case perinatal death compare case Apgar score 7-10 ; c. Qualitative exploration contribute cause substandard labour management ( include participant observation depth interview ) . II . Together local doctor nurse-midwives , international evidence-based guideline adapt locally achievable ( PartoMa guideline ) . Additionally , internationally peer-reviewed aim represent best possible care limited resource available facility . III . A concept continual in-house training monitoring-to-action labour develop , base PartoMa guideline implement together guideline . IV . On top PartoMa guideline continual training package , low tech intrapartum triage system develop together local staff , base PartoMa guideline ' colour code . V. An eHealth solution develop , base intervention , improve monitoring-to-action labour . VI . A cost-effectiveness analysis intervention step carry .</detailed_description>
