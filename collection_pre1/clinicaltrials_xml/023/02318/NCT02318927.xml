	<brief_summary>The study objective explore Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) two specific brain region ( Globus Pallidum , GPI , plus pedunculopontine nucleus , PPN ) medication freeze gait ( FoG ) Parkinsons Disease ( PD ) . Hopefully , information gather two brain region surgery allow development personalize DBS system address FoG . The primary outcome comparison pre-operative number FoG episodes laboratory FoG battery versus 6 month post-DBS optimized device setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As participant study follow procedure perform : A series question interview , questionnaire , checklist collect . In addition , basic information ( age , sex , race ) psychiatric , medical , family history , physical neurological exam include measure vital sign ( heart rate blood pressure ) . There `` Falls Diary ' complete ( account fall incident detail ) . Specific test do evaluate gait balance repeat throughout study . A psychiatric evaluation mood emotion perform include detailed psychological testing , consist perception , learning , memory . These psychological assessment repeat every study visit . An MRI CT scan perform make sure exact location DBS implant . The study end 24 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . A clinical diagnosis idiopathic PD , without previous DBS operation 2 . Must deem appropriate GPi DBS operation interdisciplinary screening team ( GPi must target chosen appropriate treatment PD qualify study ) 3 . Age 3075 year ( must meet UK Brain Bank criterion diagnosis idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ) . 4 . Experiencing significant gait postural instability despite optimal pharmacologic management ( Hoehn Yahr Stage II great state ) . 5 . Best medication `` '' reveal meaningful improvement posture score ( Pull Test ) . Patients must challenge person suprathreshold dose levodopa ( 1.5 time optimized regular dose levodopa ) must poor improvement postural stability . 6 . Patients must possess clinical history gait freeze &gt; 2 episode per month , include , participant must also score &gt; 1 item # 3 Freezing Gait ( FOG ) Questionnaire exhibit five FoG episode provocation protocol state . 7 . Ldopa responsive clearly define `` '' period . 8 . Willingness ability cooperate conscious operative procedure , well postsurgical evaluation , adjustment medication stimulator setting . 1 . Clinically significant medical disease would increase risk develop pre postoperative complication . Clinically significant medical disease include uncontrolled systemic hypertension value 170/100mmHg ; cardiac pulmonary disease ; uncorrected coagulation abnormality need therapeutic anticoagulation interrupt ; condition would render patient unable safely cooperate study test judge screen physician . 2 . Evidence secondary atypical parkinsonism . 3 . Other neurological musculoskeletal impairment would negatively influence postural stability 4 . Past MRI scan significant evidence brain atrophy abnormality . 5 . Dementia evidence impairment two neuropsychological domain Mattis Dementia Score &lt; 130 . 6 . A major untreated psychiatric disorder reveal psychiatric exam screening , Beck Depression Inventory Score &gt; 14 . 7 . Subjects history seizure . 8 . Subjects may require repeat MRI scan . 9 . Subjects history cranial neurosurgical procedure . 10 . Subjects metal head another implanted stimulator ( e.g . vagus nerve stimulator , spinal cord stimulator , pacemaker , cochlear implant , etc ) . 11 . Subjects require treatment Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) . 12 . Pregnant nursing woman woman wish become pregnant exclude .</criteria>
