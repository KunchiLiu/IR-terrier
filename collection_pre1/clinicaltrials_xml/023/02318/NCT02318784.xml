	<brief_title>Carfilzomib Treatment Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuroendocrine malignancy pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( PNETs ) gastrointestinal ( GI ) carcinoid , generally rare incidence increase . In vitro vivo study show proteasome inhibitor activity variety tumor type . Carfilzomib ( Kyprolis® ) irreversible proteasome inhibitor favorable safety profile study variety hematologic solid tumor . Carfilzomib receive accelerated approval U.S. FDA 2012 , base favorable response rate , treatment patient multiple myeloma receive least two prior therapy , demonstrate disease progression within 60 day complete last therapy . In multi-center study , investigator propose evaluate carfilzomib treatment patient advance neuroendocrine cancer .</detailed_description>
