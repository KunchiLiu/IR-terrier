	<brief_title>Glycosade v UCCS Dietary Management Hepatic GSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>'Glyde ' prospective , randomise double blind crossover trial compare effect 2 different starch use dietary management GSD . The study recruit 64 patient approximately 6 centre UK , USA , France The Netherlands . The planned duration per participant 2 year . Participants randomise 2 two equally sized group : Arm A- Glycosade intake give first , follow UCCS 1-6 week later Arm B- UCCS intake give first , follow Glycosade 1-6 week later . The objective trial establish whether Glycosade速 improve outcome patient GSD compare UCCS therapy compare duration normal blood sugar , lactate ketone level patient hepatic GSD ( Types I , III , VI IX ) post equivalent intake UCCS Glycosade速 . The first part consist two ( blind ) 12 hour starch load test administer randomly within maximum 6 week period . Participants randomise receive either UCCS Glycosade速 initial intervention period cross product second intervention period ( part 1 ) . The second part ( unblinded ) 24 month open follow whereby participant 's continue product consider suitable clinician patient .</detailed_description>
