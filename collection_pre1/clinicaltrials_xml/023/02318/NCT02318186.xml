	<brief_summary>Abstract This multi-center , open-label pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study examine relationship steady-state plasma concentration dose treprostinil deliver intravenously subcutaneously child pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . Subjects divide 5 cohort age . A blood sample obtain subject steady state . Additional blood sample obtain small subset subject 15 % increase least 15ng/kg/min increase dose steady state . Samples send pharmacokinetic laboratory analysis . Linear regression analysis use determine relationship steady state plasma concentration drug dose . A power model use assess dose proportionality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study Sub-q IV Treprostinil Kids With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ( PAH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Information Rationale Treprostinil adequately study determine safety efficacy child â‰¤ 16 year old . However , drug 's use tolerance child PAH demonstrate study small sample size . Although pharmacokinetic relationship treprostinil establish adult patient PAH , relationship steady-state plasma concentration dose child require investigation physiologic difference , maturity enzyme system drug clearance mechanism , child adult . The subject study divide cohort age address physiologic change occur throughout childhood . Currently , data exists demonstrate relationship steady-state plasma concentration dose child treat intravenously subcutaneously deliver treprostinil . Understanding pharmacokinetics treprostinil among different age cohort child provide data make informed recommendation dose base age ( possibly weight ) .</detailed_description>
