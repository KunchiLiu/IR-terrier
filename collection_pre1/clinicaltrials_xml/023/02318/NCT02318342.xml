	<detailed_description>Patients history SAVR TAVR bioprosthetic aortic valve undergo cardiac contrast CT image transthoracic echocardiography evaluate structural functional integrity aortic valve . The imaging study perform least 48-hours TAVR/SAVR . Patients prosthetic valve abnormality suggestive thrombus administer anticoagulation therapy Vitamin K antagonist ( Warfarin ) 3 month goal International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) 2-3 , follow repeat contrast CT chest transthoracic imaging . Repeat image follow 3 month anticoagulation therapy perform evaluate response anticoagulation therapy . INR level monitor warfarin dose adjust maintain target INR 2-3 .</detailed_description>
