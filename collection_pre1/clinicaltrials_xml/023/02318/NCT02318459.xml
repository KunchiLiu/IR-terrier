	<brief_title>High Intensity Interval Training Geriatrics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High Intensity Interval Training ( HIIT ) show superior effectiveness efficiency compare Moderate Intensity Continuous Training ( MICT ) several type patient healthy subject . There data HIIT general geriatric population . This study pilot study evaluate feasibility use HIIT geriatric hospitalize patient compare standard current rehabilitation practice without HIIT . It desire perform large randomize comparative trial HIIT MICT pilot study prove feasibility .</detailed_description>
