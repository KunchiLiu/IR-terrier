	<detailed_description>Introduction : A central challenge delivery evidence-based intervention promote under-five child survival coordination care across multiple tier health system , frontline health worker , primary care clinic , district hospital , specialty provider . Additionally , child survive avoid once-fatal disease congenital rheumatic heart disease , prematurity , neurodevelopmental condition , disability sustain traumatic injury , increasingly live well adolescence , young adulthood , beyond . Healthcare delivery system resource-limited setting , however , ill-equipped manage patient ' care . Mobile technology , couple effective management strategy , may enhance implementation coordination evidence-based intervention , control trial exist validate . Particularly lacking strategy incorporate mobile technology integrate manner across health system . Intervention : We develop mobile health care coordination quality improvement intervention within two rural district healthcare system Nepal , child mortality rate estimate 82 per 1,000 , coordination child health care poor . Firstly , intervention aim increase timely engagement acute care child age five receive evidence-based World Health Organization protocol aim reduce child mortality—Integrated Management Pregnancy Childbirth , Integrated Management Childhood Illness , Integrated Management Emergency Essential Surgical Care , Community-based Management Severe Acute Malnutrition . Secondly , intervention aim implement Chronic Care Model pediatric patient age twenty suffer chronic disease ( congenital rheumatic heart disease , diabetes , depression , epilepsy , asthma , musculoskeletal neurodevelopmental disability , pre- post-surgical condition ) . Analysis : We conduct quasi-experimental , stepped-wedge , cluster-controlled trial . The primary outcome trial under-two mortality . We hypothesize 25 % reduction under-two mortality rate intervention period , relative control period . We hypothesize 50 % improvement follow-up rate , 30 % improvement global symptom score , 20 % reduction disability score , 20 % reduction inpatient day hospital . We use quantitative qualitative method assess scalability intervention term logistics , human resource , cost , utilization . Impact : Rigorous evaluation systems-level child healthcare intervention need drive global healthcare policy implementation . The trial propose inform potential impact scalability health system strengthen intervention .</detailed_description>
