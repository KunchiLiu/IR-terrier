	<brief_summary>There risk pulmonary edema patient undergoing pulmonary lobectomy one lung ventilation . The overload fluid administration could relate development pulmonary edema patent thoracic surgery . But fluid restriction may cause major organ hypoperfusion surgery . The purpose study evaluate ability stroke volume variation indicator fluid responsiveness patient receive pulmonary lobectomy via thoracotomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Could Stroke Volume Variation Predict Fluid Responsiveness Thoracotomy ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perioperative fluid management thoracic surgery significantly important , quite difficult prevent pulmonary edema due fluid overload compromise perfusion vital organ . So , essential maintain optimal organ perfusion appropriate fluid management thoracic surgery . Stroke volume variation ( SVV ) derive pulse contour analysis know SVV â‰¥12~15 % correlate fluid responsiveness , define significant increase cardiac output fluid loading , dung two-lung ventilation . It parameter derive change stroke volume ( SV ) accord heart-lung interaction mechanical ventilation . positive pressure ventilation induce cyclic change leave ventricular SV relate mainly expiratory decrease right ventricular fill ejection . This reflected variation SV . However ventilator issue , tidal volume , PEEP , chest lung condition , cardiovascular condition , heart rate , rhythm , ventricular function , cardiac afterload , arterial compliance may affect SVV . Recently study report SVV could predict fluid responsiveness mechanically ventilated patient various condition . But still unclear whether SVV could predict fluid responsiveness one lung ventilation chest open via thoracotomy . During one-lung ventilation , shunt blood flow non-ventilated-lung dose contribute generation SVV . And chest open thoracotomy , pressure generate ventilator would transmit pulmonary vessel rather atmosphere . So , purpose study evaluate ability SVV indicator fluid responsiveness particularly patient undergo one-lung ventilation thoracotomy find optimal threshold value SVV fluid management thoracic surgery .</detailed_description>
