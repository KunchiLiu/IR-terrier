	<brief_summary>Aim study assess role negative pressure therapy prevention complication laparotomy wound high risk patient group . Primary outcome : Reduction wound infection rate 50 % Secondary outcome : Reduction length hospital stay Decrease use abx . wound management Decrease cost patient treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomised Control Study Asses Role Negative Pressure Wound Therapy ( NPWT ) Management Wound Surgical Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wound complication common general surgical patient laparotomy . The rate Surgical Site Infections elective surgery range 3-30 % , depend study . There subgroups patient co-morbid condition put high risk wound complication . These co-morbid condition include increase BMI , know malignancy , diabetes mellitus , emergency surgery , malnutrition , smoke diffuse atherosclerotic disease involve artery . Management complicate wound significant source psychological trauma patient significantly increase hospital stay cost . Since introduction , Negative Pressure Wound Therapy ( NPWT ) use mainly deal chronic wound . Mechanism action NPWT include protection wound bed , splint soft tissue , reduction oedema , increase blood perfusion wound enhance granulation tissue . Application Negative Pressure Wound Therapy prevent wound complication new concept , successfully apply acute wound orthopaedics , gynecological cardiothoracic surgery patient . There limited data use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy high risk general surgical patient acute wound , available study suggest significant reduction wound complication rate hospital cost . There need randomise control study ass reduction wound complication ratio . Patient randomize two group : Group 1 . Standard wound treatment , Group 2 . Treatment negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) . If patient randomize standard wound treatment group - he/she receive standard skin closure standard Mepore dressing , change daily basis . Patients randomize negative pressure group receive negative pressure dress ( Pico Wound Management System - manufacture Smith &amp; Nephew ) associate Acticoat Flex dress apply immediately skin closure conventional way leave place 7 day . Negative pressure dress change 7 day period - day 2 4 . Wound complication within first 30 day surgery record clinical examination . Participants recruit patient undergo elective emergency surgery Connolly Hospital , Beaumont Hospital , St Vincent University Hospital Mater Misericordiae University Hospital base inclusion exclusion criterion . Inclusion criterion : 1 . One : - High BMI - Malignancy - Malnutrition - T2 DM - Emergency surgery - Post radio chemotherapy - On steroid - Open colorectal resection 2 . At least two : - Smoking - Age &gt; 75 - Diffuse atherosclerotic disease involve artery Exclusion criterion : - Low risk laparotomy wound ( none criterion ) - Age &lt; 18 Patient fulfills inclusion criterion contact prior surgery research team member . Details study risk benefit explain patient . After obtain consent patient randomize one two group - standard wound treatment negative pressure treatment - senior research team member . depend randomisation patient recived appropriate dressing . Surgical wound ass day 2 4 , day 7 day 30 . Prior first dress application , 2-4 day day 30 wound swap obtain C &amp; S . Any wound complication record research evaluation form .</detailed_description>
