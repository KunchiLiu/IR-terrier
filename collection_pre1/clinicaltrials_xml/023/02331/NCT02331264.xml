	<brief_summary>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To establish effect metal ion release metal hip implant cardiac function STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES To assess effect metal ion hip implant cardiac function measure Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( CMR ) Echocardiogram . This involve surrogate detection cobalt ion deposition within cardiac tissue assessment ejection fraction tissue characterization ( without contrast ) . STUDY IMPACT With 60,000 patient metal metal ( MOM ) hip implant United Kingdom ( UK ) , million worldwide , need clarify important question , source significant concern amongst patient surgeon alike . Also , problem unique MOM hip since hip implant contain metal see various case report high blood cobalt level arise catastrophic failure ( e.g . fracture ceramic bearing surface ) lead abnormal wear implant release metal ion body . In UK , 80,000 hip implant insert annually .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Metal-on-metal ( MOM ) hip implant risk release metal ion upon wear component material . Some metal ion ( e.g . cobalt chromium ) metal implant metal particle enter bloodstream . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA , USA ) recently highlight systemic toxicity metal metal hip implant cause concern recommend patient systemic symptom assess particular focus cardiovascular , neurological , endocrinological ( especially thyroid ) , renal system . A number case suspect toxicity circulate cobalt chromium MOM hip implant , include cardiac toxicity , report recently . The profound case involve patient die cardiac failure secondary cardiomyopathy cobalt deposition within cardiac tissue . A recent cross sectional health screen isolate case report , suggest raise metal ion level potential cause cardiomyopathy cardiac failure . Such case raise public anxiety process . Blood metal ion release metal hip implant increasingly recognize potential cause local distant abnormal tissue response , since cobalt chromium release peri-prosthetic tissue transport systemically throughout body . Component design position associate increased wear result raise metal ion level . However , definitive causal link systemic symptom still remain establish . Iron overload disorder affect heart liver significant cause morbidity primary secondary haemochromatosis thalassaemia . Excessive iron deposition within cardiac tissue lead premature death secondary fatal arrhythmias heart failure . Cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR ) image revolutionise management particular group patient allow robust non-invasive method detect iron loading . CMR gold-standard method assess cardiac volume , function mass . It 's unique strength image modality tissue characterization without use contrast agent . Myocardial iron detect due effect relaxation time interaction iron hydrogen nucleus normal cardiac tissue . Cobalt ferromagnetic metal contain unpaired electron allow align parallel apply magnetic field , therefore detect MRI similar way iron . RATIONALE No study attempt identify cobalt deposition within cardiac tissue use cardiac MRI . We therefore aim detect cobalt deposition cardiac tissue patient metal hip implant markedly raise cobalt blood ion level . If detect , aim ass whether clinical effect cardiac function . Our hypothesis discernable effect cardiac function detectable Cardiac MRI Echocardiography patient raise blood cobalt ion level . Case Controlled Cohort Observation study Three group patient identify Hip implant ( match age , sex time since surgery ) . 1 . Patients MOM hip implant raise metal ion level ( &gt; 7ppb ) - N=30 2 . Patients MOM hip implant Normal Metal ion level ( &lt; 7ppb ) - N=30 3 . Patients non-metal bear hip implant ( Ceramic Ceramic/Polyethylene ( COC/COP ) ) - N=30 Selection group define metal ion blood test hip implant type . Patients two consecutive blood test appropriate level le 10 % variation ( last 12 month ) include , blood test appropriate level take last 3 month include . The cardiologist blind regard patient grouping , ensure bias report clinical cardiological investigation result light presence absence raise blood metal ion . All participant enrol : - Be assess cardiologist - Have cardiac MRI , ECHOcardiogram , Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) These clinical data analyse compare assess significant difference exist 3 group .</detailed_description>
