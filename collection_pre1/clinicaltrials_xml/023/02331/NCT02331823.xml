	<brief_title>Research New Regimens Retreatment Pulmonary Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>China country second high Tuberculosis ( TB ) burden world . Most retreatment TB patient may develop multi-drug resistant . The resistant rate anti-TB drug 35.9 % , multi-drug resistant rate 15.4 % . Retreatment TB become one factor inhibit decrease morbidity mortality TB . It also tuff work TB control . At present standardized regimen retreatment TB 2SHREZ/6HRE 3HREZ/6HRE . The drug regimen first-line anti-TB drug unsuitable high drug resistance prevalence , cure rate regimen low adverse reaction severe . Our study national multi-center , prospective trail investigate efficacy new super-short regimen retreatment TB patient . The new regimen consist 5 drug last 5 month . The cure rate success rate new regimen compare standardized regimen usually 8-9 month order obtain optimized regimen .</detailed_description>
