	<brief_title>CAR T Cells Treating Patients With Malignant Gliomas Overexpressing EGFR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Patients advance gliomas limited treatment option . Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) often amplified patient glioblastoma ( GBM ) regard suitable target GBM treatment . The investigator construct lentiviral vector contain chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) recognize overexpressed EGFR tumor cell EGFR normal cell , use mediate genetic transfer CAR high efficiency without need perform selection . OBJECTIVES : Primary Objectives To evaluate safety administration anti-EGFR CAR engineer T lymphocytes patient receive non-myeloablative conditioning regimen , aldesleukin Secondary objective To determine whether glioma regress patient receive anti-EGFR CAR-engineered T lymphocytes aldesleukin follow nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen . ELIGIBILITY : Histologically proven glioblastoma glisarcoma overexpressing EGFR determine IHC , Western blot , FISH RT-PCR . Failed prior standard treatment radiotherapy without chemotherapy . Cardiac , pulmonary laboratory parameter within acceptable limit DESIGN : The study conduct use Phase I design . Patients receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow intravenous infusion ex vivo tumor reactive , CAR gene-transduced T cell , plus IV aldesleukin . A total 10 patient may enrol period 1-2 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients histologically proven glioblastomas gliosarcomas overexpress EGFR assess IHC , FISH , western blot RTPCR . 2 . Patients must progression disease radiotherapy ( include patient undergo surgery recurrent disease render NED ) . This include recurrent GBM receive standard firstline treatment , include surgery ( feasible due neurosurgical neuroanatomical consideration ) adjuvant radiotherapy +/ chemotherapy . 3 . Patients must either receive steroid , stable dose steroid least five day prior registration . 4 . Patients must great equal 18 year age less equal age 70 , must life expectancy &gt; 8 week 5 . Patients must able understand sign Informed Consent Document 6 . Must willing sign durable power attorney . 7 . Patients gender must willing practice birth control four month follow treatment . 8 . Women child bear potential must negative pregnancy test potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus . 9 . Serology : Seronegative HIV antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immunecompetence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Seronegative hepatitis B antigen , seronegative hepatitis C antibody unless antigen negative . If hepatitis C antibody test positive , patient must test presence antigen RTPCR HCV RNA negative . 10 . Hematology WBC great equal 3000/mm ( 3 ) ANC great equal 1000/mm ( 3 ) without support filgrastim Platelet count great equal 100,000/mm ( 3 ) Hemoglobin great equal 8.0 g/dl ( eligibility level hemoglobin may reach transfusion ) 11 . Chemistry : ALT/AST le equal 2.5 time upper limit normal Creatinine le equal 1.6 mg/dl Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg/dl , except patient Gilbert Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dl . 12 . Patients must least 4 week radiation therapy . Additionally , patient must least 6 week nitrosoureas , 4 week temozolomide , 3 week procarbazine , 2 week vincristine 4 week last bevacizumab administration . Patients must least 4 week cytotoxic therapy list 2 week noncytotoxic agent ( e.g. , interferon , tamoxifen ) include investigative agent . All toxicity prior therapy resolve CTCAE less equal grade 1 ( except toxicity alopecia , vitiligo ) . 1 . A prior history gliadel implantation past six months.. 2 . Women currently pregnant breast feeding potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus infant . 3 . Active systemic infection , coagulation disorder major medical illness include cardiovascular , respiratory immune system , myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia , obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease . 4 . Any form primary immunodeficiency ( Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease ) . 5 . Concurrent opportunistic infection ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients decrease immune competence may less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity ) . 6 . History severe immediate hypersensitivity agent include cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , aldesleukin . 7 . History coronary revascularization ischemic symptom . 8 . Clinically significant hemorrhagic ischemic stroke , include transient ischemic attack central nervous system bleed precede 6 month relate glioma surgery . History prior intratumoral bleeding exclusion criterion ; patient history prior intratumoral bleeding , however , need undergo noncontrast head CT exclude acute bleeding . 9 . Other concomitant anticancer therapy except corticosteroid . 10 . Any patient know LVEF less equal 45 % .</criteria>
