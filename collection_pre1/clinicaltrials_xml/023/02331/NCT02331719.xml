	<brief_summary>Intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) severe form stroke : early mortality 40 % , 80 % -of survivor physically disabled high rate cognitive impairment depression . In effort address issue conventional treatment , new integrate systematic approach develop . This approach utilize educational process specific core competency ( pillar ) mapping , navigation , access , optic automate resection integrate single standardized system deliver target therapy individual patient base location patient factor . This system demonstrate safety efficacy oncology patient also FDA approve use ICH patient population well . This registry collect data form multiple site preform MiSPACE procedure part clinical care . The intent registry collect data economic impact well clinical outcome use MiSPACE approach integrate technology early treatment ICH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aurora Health Care serve coordinate center prepare Standard Operating Procedures address registry operation analysis activity , patient recruitment , data collection , data management , data analysis , report adverse event . Sites identify , recruit , obtain consent subject collect data use standard form ; activity monitor remotely coordinate site . Data participate hospital check heterogeneity , query subsequently pool . Baseline patient characteristic demographic , Hemphill Essen predictive score , NIHSS stroke severity score , functional status Barthel index mRS score , ICH volumetric assessment , present mean , median , proportion , appropriate . Eligibility consent rate derive center . Analyses largely descriptive nature . Follow-up assessment 30 90 day , composite outcome death disability ( define mRS &gt; 2 ) , death disability separately , describe proportion . Tallies surgical complication also derive separate outcome . Analysis 30- 90-day status entail informal comparison purpose provide preliminary evidence planning large comparative trial . The proportion patient experimental treatment suffer death dependency 30-days , determine cutoff modify Rankin Scale exact binomial upper low 90 % confidence limit use comparison criterion : ( 1 ) 65 % ( historical proportion patient medical management , unselected baseline risk ) , ( 2 ) 50 % ( proportion patient minimally invasive surgical technique unselected baseline risk ) . This confidence limit comparative approach provide flexible method assessment non-inferiority , equivalence , superiority . The unselected population , however , mix patient different level baseline risk , follow-up stratified analysis conduct count permit . The unselected population match use demographic , lesion characteristic comorbidities close possible study group . A heterogeneity index use comparison . As corollary analysis , baseline predictive score ( translate score percentages/risks ) use calculate expect count 30 90 day status stratify within 0-3 range Hemphill ICH score 0-10 range Essen ICH score , expect count compare observed count use Fisher Exact Test . Fifty ( 50 ) patient choose convenient sample size , base enrollment participate hospital , recruitment accomplish reasonable timeframe 2 year . About 65 % unselected patient ICH ( , stratify baseline predict risk ) document 30- day composite outcome death dependency medical management . Reviews type minimallyinvasive ICH surgery provide evidence significantly improve outcome ( meta-analysis odds ratio 0.54 ( 0.39 , 0.76 ) ) . An odds ratio 0.54 indicate reduction risk 65 % 50 % ( 15 % absolute reduction ) . Assuming new procedure truly least effective minimally invasive surgery ( 50 % 30-day composite outcome risk ) , therefore 15 % effective conventional management , 50 patient provide 66 % surity 95 % 1-sided confidence interval exclude chance new procedure worse medical management . An alternative method framing , base exact one-sided binomial test one-sample proportion alpha level 5 % , sample size 50 patient provide approximately 66 % surity/power new procedure superior medical management ( i.e. , low 65 % suffer death poor functional outcome ) . The computed critical value test , provide initial evidence superiority , observe 26 patient ( 50 ) suffer death dependency new surgical procedure . The surity/power 66 % use assumption permissive . The study size preliminary nature result sufficient perform robust statistical test superiority non-inferiority new parafascicular ICH-evacuation technique , though result registry provide crucial first look effectiveness , health cost .</detailed_description>
