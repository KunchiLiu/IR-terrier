	<brief_summary>Pain represent one common symptom Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) seriously affect patient health-related quality life . Central neuropathic pain , main form pain MS patient , represent significant clinical problem , consideration poorly responsiveness available therapy . Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) non-invasive , well-tolerated procedure high well documented neuromodulation activity Central Nervous System ( CNS ) level . First evidence obtain animal , neurophysiological clinical study suggest potential efficacy neuropathic pain treatment . In particular spinal DCS ( sDCS ) proven modulate Nociceptive Withdrawal Reflex ( NWR ) , objective sensitive tool explore pain processing Spinal Level recommend European Federation Neurological Society ( EFNS ) evaluate analgesic effect treatment . In order view investigator ' objective investigate sDCS efficacy MS neurophatic pain treatment apply validated clinical scale , neurophysiological acquisition specific biological marker dosage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator plan recruit , IRCCS Neurological National Institute C. Mondino , 60 consecutive patient definite Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) accord 2005 McDonald criterion follow-up procedure include general neurological evaluation score accord Expanded Disability Status Scale Kurtzke functional system . Relapsing-remitting ( RR ) , secondary-progressive ( SP ) primary-progressive ( PP ) MS patient , affect neuropathic nociceptive chronic pain condition accord 1994 International Association Study Pain ( IASP ) classification , recruit . Patients complain form headache exclude study . The investigator exclude also patient cognitive impairment ( Minimental State Examination - MMSE- &lt; = 21 ) psychiatry disease , particular depression ( Back Depression Inventory Scale - BDI - &gt; 15 ) . Characteristic intensity pain symptom collect respectively validated Italian version Neuropathic Pain Symptoms Inventory Scale ( NPSI ) Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) . Spasticity low leg , present , clinical assess Ashworth Scale Neurophysiologically evaluate H/M ratio Vibratory Inhibition H-Reflex . Health-Related Quality Life ( HRQoL ) assess mean Medical Outcome 36-item Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) whereas presence severity fatigue assess mean Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) . RR patient evaluate stationary phase disease least two month last clinical relapse least one month end steroidal treatment . Patients consecutive enrol study randomly assign two group : 1 . Sham 2 . Anodal Spinal Direct Current Stimulation Treatment , double-blind , placebo control study design . Before enrollment , study protocol explain subject , informed write consent obtain . The investigator proceed follow : 1 . Time enrollment - T0 First Day - Complete clinical evaluation administration MMSE BDI exclusion criterion - Randomized assignment Anodal Sham treatment group - Administration NPSI , SF-36 , HRQoL e FSS - Evaluation Somatosensory Evoked Potential Posterior Tibial Medial Nerve stimulation investigate somatosensory pathway involvement . - Clinical Neurophysiological evaluation Spasticity ( present ) : Ashworth Scale H/M ratio HReflex Vibratory Inhibition . - Collection blood sample evaluate activity Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase ( FAAH ) platelet . Second Day - First Anodal Sham Direct Current Stimulation Treatment Session ( sDCS ) - Neurophysiological acquisition Nociceptive Withdrawal Reflex ( NWR ) NWR Temporal Summation ( see 'Neurophysiological Acquisition ' Session detail ) 30 60 minute first sDCS treatment 2. sDCS Treatment After evaluation T0 patient undergo 10 daily sDCS treatment , 5 day week ( see sDCS treatment session detail ) . 3 . Evaluation 10 day treatment - T1 - Administration NPSI , SF-36 , HRQoL e FESS - Clinical Neurophysiological evaluation Spasticity ( present ) : Ashworth Scale H/M ratio HReflex Vibratory Inhibition . - Collection blood sample evaluate activity Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase ( FAAH ) platelet . - Neurophysiological acquisition Nociceptive Withdrawal Reflex ( NWR ) NWR Temporal Summation 4 . Evaluation 1 month end treatment - T2 - Administration NPSI , SF-36 , HRQoL e FESS - Clinical Neurophysiological evaluation Spasticity ( present ) : Ashworth Scale H/M ratio HReflex Vibratory Inhibition . - Collection blood sample evaluate activity Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase ( FAAH ) platelet . - Neurophysiological acquisition Nociceptive Withdrawal Reflex ( NWR ) NWR Temporal Summation</detailed_description>
