	<detailed_description>Evaluation response systemic therapy dependant clinical radiographic change assess prior several cycle systemic therapy . The response rate lung cancer systemic therapy range 30 - 85 % , depend histology clinical factor , difficult predict individual patient . Spermine-spermidine acetyl transferase ( SSAT1 ) activity up-regulated many cancer may marker response therapy . Metabolism acetyl amantadine ( AA ) reflective SSAT1 activity . In order determine change SSAT1 activity predictive response systemic chemotherapy , propose follow pilot clinical trial . A total 20 volunteer patient - 10 patient adenocarcinoma lung 10 patient small-cell histology include . Eligibility include patient adenocarcinoma small-cell lung cancer AJCC stage III IV diagnosis . Volunteers inform study examine possibility detect therapeutic response change excretion AA detect conventional patient assessment method . The chemotherapy regimen select treat physician influence participation clinical trial . The usual treatment regimen entity describe platinum-based doublet , often cis-platin etoposide gemcitabine administer 4 6 cycle . The therapeutic response rate drug regimens 40 % adenocarcinoma 70 % small-cell carcinoma . Clinical response usually assessed second third cycle chemotherapy . Biological Sampling Details Patient volunteer ask fast overnight prior day first schedule chemotherapy ingest oral dose 200 mg amantadine hydrochloride ( HCl ) morning within hour arrive clinic . The following biological specimen collect : blood ( 2 x 10 ml ) 2 4 hour amantadine ingestion , saliva ( 2 x 5ml ) immediately blood sample , total urine specimen time 2 blood sample . Patient instruct empty bladder immediately first blood sample collect total urine produce end second blood sample ( 4 hour ) . Subsequently , patient allow lunch ( choose ) prior schedule chemotherapy . The sample protocol repeat 3 week later second cycle chemotherapy . Data collect : tumour type ( histology ) , stage cancer , age , sex , weight , height , smoke history , concurrent medication , systemic chemotherapy treatment prescribed history recent alcohol intake . Data use correlation determine relationship plasma , salivary urinary AA particular cancer diagnosis response treatment . Primary Endpoints : Documentation acetylamantadine metabolite excretion/secretion . Response therapy ( complete response , partial response , stable disease , progressive disease ) . Time disease recurrence progression .</detailed_description>
