	<brief_summary>To evaluate combination electric hearing Cochlear Implant acoustic hearing hearing aid bimodal user moderate-to-severe hearing loss non-implanted ear . The research also provide pilot study data unilateral Cochlear Implant recipients residual useful acoustic hearing implanted ear whose acoustic hearing preserve .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Bimodal Contribution Adult Cochlear Implant Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many current unilateral Cochlear Implant user residual acoustic hearing opposite ear well implanted ear . The amount useful residual acoustic hearing varies among implantees . There several acoustic electric combination bilateral-bimodal listen mode depend amount useful residual acoustic hearing ear . The combination low frequency acoustic information provide hearing aid ear , complete high frequency electric information provide Cochlear Implant ( complementary bimodal benefit ) . Each different rehabilitation combinationsfor unilateral Cochlear Implant user enablesa unique integration three aspect bilateral hearing bilaterality , binaurality bimodality may provide significant advantage unilateral Cochlear Implant stimulation term speech perception noise , complementary information well localization ability . The study include 20 bilateral-bimodal user moderate-to-severe hearing loss 250 Hz , 500 Hz 1000 Hz non-implanted ear , use hearing aid least 75 % waking hour . Evaluation utilizes bilateral-binaural bimodal complementary effect task-specific test battery base publish doctoral research project . The assessment protocol consist test include various speech material , different masker , presentation noise different location space , right/left speech lateralization , pitch-related task subjective questionnaire . All test administer three listen condition : Cochlear Implant -alone , hear aid-alone Cochlear Implant +hearing aid .</detailed_description>
