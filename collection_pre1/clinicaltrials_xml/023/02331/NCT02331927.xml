	<brief_summary>The primary objective two phase PERMAD trial evaluation impact personalize marker-driven treatment approach early detection progression modification treatment cytokine angiogenic factor ( CAF ) efficacy . In regard two part , primary objective run-in phase ( n=50 patient ) conventional switch chemotherapy together anti-angiogenic agent determination distinct cytokine angiogenic factor ( CAF ) profile treatment FOLFOX bevacizumab , allow early detection/prediction progressive disease . The primary objective marker-driven randomize part ( n=150 patient ) marker-driven switch antiangiogenic agent maintenance chemotherapy evaluation efficacy early marker-driven switch anti-angiogenic treatment ( bevacizumab aflibercept ) This multicentre , multinational , open label , prospective , randomize , control phase II study design assess clinical utility early marker driven change anti-angiogenic treatment ( bevacizumab aflibercept ) maintain chemotherapy backbone definite radiological progression first line treatment patient metastatic colorectal cancer . After complete run phase study , least 30 patient complete first line treatment ( due progression , secondary resection toxicity ) evaluable CAF analysis , result review Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) . Based review decision continue , modify cancel randomize part make . The primary endpoint run-in phase conventional switch chemotherapy together anti-angiogenic agent : • Progression free survival ( PFS1 ) first line treatment The primary endpoint randomize part marker-driven switch antiangiogenic agent maintenance chemotherapy : • Progression free survival rate 6 month ( PFSR @ 6 ) first cycle randomization .</brief_summary>
