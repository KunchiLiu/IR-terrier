	<brief_title>A Comparison Inhalation vs. Intravenous Induction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothermia occur anesthetic induction due redistribution hypothermia . Hypothermia adverse effect avoid minimize . Intravenous propofol induction common technique use anesthetic induction . There preliminary evidence less redistribution hypothermia anesthetic induction achieve inhalation induction compare intravenous induction . There enough data compel change practice pattern . This study enroll large number patient order provide strong evidence significant difference induction technique body temperature . Patients randomly assign two variation inhalation induction technique two variation intravenous induction . The effect temperature four group compare . Reducing degree hypothermia potential decrease surgical infection rate well provide benefit patient .</detailed_description>
