	<brief_summary>Gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GISTs ) belong sarcoma group characterize oncogenic mutation c-KIT , PDGFRA , BRAF NF-1 gene drive tumor growth . Since tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) become available , median survival GIST patient increase 9 month 5 year . Consequently , rare disease become role model target therapy . However , response TKIs extremely heterogeneous : ~15 % patient experience benefit imatinib , whereas ~17 % patient enjoy stable disease 9 year . Treatment failure due primary secondary resistance cause part mutation oncogenic gene cause change drug sensitivity . A new technique , use circulate tumor DNA , enable u assess mutation simple blood sample obtain patient treatment , thus detect new mutation early course disease . Also , difference pharmacokinetic drug behavior add observe heterogeneity , may cause resistance due drug underexposure thereby proliferation least sensitive tumor cell . This offer opportunity optimize personalize target treatment individual GIST patient timely treatment adaptation base early detection secondary TKIs resistance mutation . Achieving urgently require data daily clinical practice , include prospective serial mutation analysis serial drug plasma concentration measurement . At fundamental level also help unravel driving factor behind primary secondary TKIs resistance model disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GIST : Assessment Tumor Mutations TKI Plasma Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment Dutch GIST patient centralize : almost patient refer one five collaborating center form Dutch GIST consortium , UMCG , NKI-AvL , Radboud UMC , Erasmus MC LUMC . To optimize treatment patient , center implement standard-of-care diagnostic treatment plan assure collection homogenous phenotypic treatment data bio-databank . The consortium support work close collaboration Dutch sarcoma GIST patient organization . A prospective , longitudinal bio-databank set . Data regard multi-morbidity , drug pharmacokinetics serial tumor genotypic data collect prospectively ( new ) GIST patient TKI treatment . Our standard-of-care plan include primary tumor mutation analysis , perform pathology laboratory site . At follow visit treatment , blood collect assess TKI plasma exposure perform mutation analysis circulate tumor DNA . All patient follow tumor RECIST 1.1 progression assess CT scan ask undergo tumor biopsy progression detect secondary resistance mutation . The development model predict secondary imatinib resistance base patient phenotype tumor genotype , achieve analyze GIST patient progressive disease imatinib ( index patient ; n=30 ) bio-databank . These patient match 1:1 non-progressive patient treat duration index patient . Regarding index patient , next-generation gene-targeted mutation analysis perform archival tumor material tumor biopsy progression identify patient 's unique secondary mutation . The mutation study : KIT exon 9 , exon 11 , exon 13 , exon 14 , exon 17 exon 18 ; PDGFRA exon 12 , exon 14 exon 18 BRAF exon 10 en exon 15 . In-depth analysis regard mutation analysis circulate tumor DNA imatinib drug concentration assessment perform 60 patient .</detailed_description>
