	<brief_summary>There study demonstrate best improve daily activity people heart failure ( HF ) . Exercise alone show ineffective , techniques daily activity feedback encouragement health coaching may helpful . This research study investigate two different treatment approach improve daily activity : 1 ) daily activity feedback encouragement , 2 ) health coach individualize home exercise program . Both treatment approach hypothesize result improved daily activity compare control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interventions Improve Daily Activity Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Few study able demonstrate intervention efficacy improve daily activity heart failure ( HF ) . Exercise alone ineffective , though psychosocial-based intervention include health coach daily activity feedback appear promise . Therefore , primary purpose present propose study investigate effect two different intervention approach ( 1. daily activity feedback associate encouragement , 2. health coaching associate individualized home exercise program ) daily activity , exercise tolerance , HF-related health status , low extremity functional strength . A secondary purpose compare daily activity record Medtronic® implanted cardioverter defibrillator ( ICDs ) cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) device daily activity record well-established triaxial accelerometer . This single-blinded randomized trial , subject randomization stratify age baseline activity level . Subjects randomize one three group : 1 ) A control group receive usual care , 2 ) group receive feedback associate encouragement daily activity , 3 ) intervention group receive health coaching associate individualized home exercise program . The study consist 3 month intervention period 6 month follow-up/ retention period ( total study enrollment period 9 month ) . The primary study endpoint Medtronic device-measured daily activity . All study endpoint assess baseline , 3 month , 9 month . The investigator conduct study measurement blind group assignment . Using previously establish minimum clinically important difference ( MCID ) 1.08 hour per day improvement daily activity ( effect size=1.54 ) measure Medtronic ICDs/CRTs , total 8 subject per group would need achieve statistical power ( 1-β ) 0.80 ( two-tailed , α=0.05 ) between-groups comparison utilizing two group . Therefore , depend observed effect size propose study , utilize 3 group approximately 10 subject group provide adequate statistical power between-groups comparison 3 group . Statistical analysis conduct meet plan study objective . With regard intervention effect , one way analysis variance plan contrast use examine between-group difference continuous variable [ Patient Activity , Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire ( KCCQ ) , Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) , six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , 30 second time chair rise ( 30-s TCR ) , heart rate variability , Optivol Fluid Index ] . If data meet requisite assumption , Kruskal-Wallis analysis variance rank use . Baseline 3 month data use ass immediate intervention effect 9 month follow-up use assess retention effect . With regard concurrent validity Medtronic Patient Activity measurement , Pearson correlation coefficient calculate daily Patient Activity ( minute per day ) two Actigraph parameter : daily activity count step per day . Correlation coefficient calculate baseline , 3-month , 9-month monitoring period provide great number sampling day . Correlation coefficient also calculate change daily activity measurement baseline 3 month baseline 9 month determine concurrent validity change daily activity measurement .</detailed_description>
