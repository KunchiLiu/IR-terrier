	<brief_title>Endoscopic Transcanal Lateral Graft Tympanoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A main part tympanoplasty repair perforate tympanic membrane . There two popular way approach tympanic membrane , transcanal postauricular approach . There two graft technique apply tympanoplasty include lateral technique ( overlay ) medial technique ( underlay ) . The lateral technique widely use institute involves placement graft lateral tympanic annulus fibrous layer tympanic remnant . The preferred approach previous experience postauricular approach tympanoplasty transcanal approach enough adequate exposure . Moreover , visualization straight transcanal provide microscope difficult limited view perforation edge due narrow curved external ear canal . Postauricular approach cause many layer tissue violate along significant postoperative pain . The author propose study aim determine alleviation postoperative pain new technique efficacy endoscope tympanoplasty .</detailed_description>
