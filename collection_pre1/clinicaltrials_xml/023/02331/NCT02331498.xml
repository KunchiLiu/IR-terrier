	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study Pazopanib+ Temozolomide Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glioblastoma ( GBM ) , common malignant primary brain tumor , represent major medical challenge consider extremely poor prognosis ( Wen 2008 ) . Current standard care include maximal surgical resection , follow concomitant radio-chemotherapy ( temozolomide - TMZ ) ( RT-CT ) follow 6 month maintenance TMZ , median overall survival ( mOS ) 14.6 vs. 12.1 month RT alone ( Stupp 2005 ) . Non operable GBM , represent around 30 % case GBM , poor prognosis , median PFS 3-4 month median OS 6-9 month ( Chinot 2007 , Stupp 2009 ) , concomitant RT-CT treatment . Therefore , innovative treatment strategy urgently need new treatment combination evaluate phase I study highly encourage ( Wen 2011 ) . Since GBM one vascularise cancer , antiangiogenic agent test use firstly recurrent GBM . Among , Bevacizumab , humanize monoclonal antibody vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , show high response rate 19 % 62 % several Phase 2 multiple retrospective study , alone combination chemotherapy ( Chamberlain 2011 ) . Two randomized phase III trial , AVAGLIO RTOG 0825 , investigate efficacy Bevacizumab add Stupp protocol patient newly diagnose GBM , present annual meeting American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO 2013 ) . While study exhibit significant progression-free survival ( PFS ) improvement ( RTOG 0825:10.7 vs. 7.3m , p=0.007 ; AVAGLIO : 10.6 vs. 6.2m , p &lt; 0.0001 ) , gain overall survival . Other antiangiogenic agent study GBM patient ( Sathornsumetee 2009 , Van Meir 2010 , Wick 2011 ) , encourage result still insufficient use single agent . Among , pazopanib think promise . It orally tyrosine kinase inhibitor potently inhibition VEGFR-1 , -2 , -3 , c-kit PDGFR-α , -β ( Castaneda 2009 , Schutz 2011 ) . Interestingly , 2 PDGFR subtypes overexpressed malignant glioma ( Verhaak 2010 ) . Furthermore , pazopanib already validated patient advance renal cell carcinoma soft-tissue sarcoma ( Sleijfer 2009 , Sternberg 2010 ) . A phase II trial evaluate efficacy safety pazopanib 35 patient recurrent GBM ( Iwamoto 2010 ) . Two patient partial radiographic response standard bidimensional measurement , whereas 9 patient ( 6 8-week point 3 within first month treatment ) decrease contrast enhancement , vasogenic edema , mass effect &lt; 50 % reduction tumor . The median PFS 12 week mOS 35 week . Pazopanib reasonably well tolerate spectrum toxicity similar anti-VEGF/VEGFR agent unexpected toxicity . Given emerge concern pure anti-VEGF inhibition may promote malignant glial cell invasiveness ( Keunen 2011 ) , consider essential combine multitargeted antiangiogenic agent , pazopanib , current standard treatment . TMZ choose represent current standard care good penetration brain parenchyma low hepatic metabolism , make unlikely occurrence pharmacokinetic interaction pazopanib ( Friedman 2000 ) . Indeed , phase I trials TMZ combination molecules RAD001 , cilengitide , gefitinib irinotecan show need dose modification TMZ . Similarly , Phase I trials pazopanib association paclitaxel FOLFOX6 conduct dose 800 mg daily , recommend dose pazopanib monotherapy , standard dos chemotherapy ( Tan 2010 , Brady 2009 ) . Finally , study toxicity profile pazopanib TMZ suggest specific limit dose escalation adverse event , except perhaps asthenia , thrombocytopenia ALAT elevation . However , consider high level potential toxicity ITK administer radiation , pazopanib administer induction phase Stupp protocol . Therefore , base strong synergy rational , study coordinator aim evaluate safety efficacy pazopanib combination TMZ maintenance phase Stupp protocol . The study coordinator hop strategy could significantly improve poor prognosis patient . This study multicenter Phase I/II trial , aim determine Recommended Phase 2 Dose ( RP2D ) pazopanib combination TMZ . The study coordinator associate multidisciplinary approach involve translational pharmacokinetic study , research potential predictive biomarkers response pharmacogenetic pharmacogenomic approach . This study include patient previously treat GBM , candidate complete partial surgical resection eligible adjuvant treatment base combination TMZ radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
