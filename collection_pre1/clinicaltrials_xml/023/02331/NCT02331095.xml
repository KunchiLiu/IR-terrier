	<brief_title>Statin Use Patients With Acute VTE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VTE potentially life-threatening disease , estimate incidence 1-2 per 1000 . Despite anticoagulation standard care , many patient still suffer complication : 30 % VTE recurrence unprovoked VTE , 25-50 % develop post-thrombotic syndrome . Therefore , urgent need effective therapy reduce long-term VTE morbidity . Limitations understand underlying pathophysiology VTE absence accurate biomarkers significant problem . Without knowledge , improvement treatment unlikely . Therefore , overall objective study determine important biomarker change acute VTE action innovative adjunct therapy biomarkers . The rationale study , biomarker change follow acute VTE action therapy establish , treatment acute VTE could improve . Statins effective prevention arterial thrombosis . Recently , arterial venous thromboses show share common pathophysiological mechanism , effective therapy arterial thrombosis could provide benefit VTE . Several observational study JUPITER trial , large , randomized , placebo-controlled study , demonstrate statin significantly reduce risk first VTE 40 % . Additionally , 3 day atorvastatin increase plasma fibrin clot permeability susceptibility lysis . Statins commonly prescribe many medical condition coronary artery disease hyperlipidemia , demonstrate good safety profile . These promising result , well safety profile , make statin attractive potential addition standard anticoagulation treat acute VTE , effort reduce long-term morbidity . The effect statins thrombin generation patient acute VTE study . A study patient atrial fibrillation warfarin show 40 % reduction endogenous thrombin potential three month intensive cholesterol-lowering treatment include statin . Similar effect could see patient acute VTE . In addition , previous study evaluate effect statins reduction D-dimer inflammatory cytokine reveal promising result focus patient acute VTE . Therefore , study generate important information acute VTE patient . This pilot , randomize , open-labelled study . Eligible patient enrol randomized 1:1 `` anticoagulation '' arm `` anticoagulation plus atorvastatin '' arm , atorvastatin give 40 mg orally daily 3 month . The targeted total accrual 80 patient , 40 arm . Patients recruited hospital clinics The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center . Follow visit plan enrollment , 3 month , 9 month randomization . At follow , blood obtain assessment include structure interview sign symptom recurrent venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , bleed , post thrombotic syndrome , adverse event study drug . The primary objective study determine reduction thrombin peak concentration and/or endogenous thrombin potential measure Thrombin Generation Assay ( TGA ) 3 month `` anticoagulation +atorvastatin '' arm compare `` anticoagulation '' arm . The secondary objective determine chronological change hemostatic , inflammatory , lipidomic biomarker profile patient acute VTE receive anticoagulation standard care , without statin . The biomarker profile interest , addition thrombin generation , include : D-dimer , IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF-α , high sensitivity C-reactive protein , free fatty acid , lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 , pro- inflammatory eicosanoids . The ultimate goal study mechanism VTE use statin VTE patient . Other secondary objective include determination relevant clinical outcome VTE recurrence , VTE related mortality , arterial thrombosis , hemorrhage , post thrombotic syndrome , residual vein obstruction patient receive standard care versus standard care plus statin .</detailed_description>
