	<brief_title>Tissue Hematopoietic Stem Cell Humanized Xenograft Studies Melanoma Squamous Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective study establish humanize animal model . Investigators consent patient melanoma head neck squamous cell cancer ( HNSCC ) agree take part research study . They obtain peripheral hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) , blood tumor tissue baseline blood tumor sample patient use establish tumor explants humanize mice . Therapy result humanize mice correlate exist newly acquire efficacy result immune-based therapy patient . A secondary objective identify pharmacodynamic marker associate drug biomarkers evidence efficacy lack thereof . Where possible , subject receive therapy FDA-approved drug interest ask provide sequential blood tumor biopsy study molecular immune event may occur result drug therapy .</detailed_description>
