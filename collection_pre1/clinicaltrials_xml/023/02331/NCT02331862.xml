	<brief_title>To Study Effect Adjunctive Oral Methylprednisolone Therapy Pediatric Urinary Tract Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The urinary tract infection ( UTI ) common etiology febrile child acute pyelonephritis ( APN ) happen 70 % child first febrile UTI . After first APN , irreversible renal scarring take place 40 % patient . The sequela renal scarring include chronic kidney disease , hypertension , complication pregnancy , even end stage renal disease . Due progression pathophysiology pyelonephritis renal scarring past year , understand inflammation one important mechanism . Therefore , many animal study clarify role anti-inflammation antioxidant reduce renal scarring . In previous study , Dr. Chiou Y.Y . colleague provide evidence adjunctive methylprednisolone ( MPD ) decrease risk renal scarring patient high risk APN , define inflammatory volume 4.6 mL technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid scan abnormal renal ultrasonography result . Our study first human study demonstrate solution renal scarring . However , whether result apply whole spectrum UTI still unknown . Purposes study follow : 1 . To design prospective , randomize , open-labeled study investigate effect side effect MPD combination conventional antibiotic affect clinical course , outcome , medical expense . 2 . To compare level urinary serum cytokine receive MPD follow sub-aim : I . To determine population benefit MPD reduce severity clinical course subsequent renal scarring . II . To understand mechanism MPD could shorten clinical course reduce renal scarring . According study , provide new effective guideline shorten disease course , save medical expense , decrease risk renal scarring sequela .</detailed_description>
