	<brief_title>Allogenic Dermis Versus Standard Care Management Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , comparative , parallel group , Multi-center clinical trial compare proportion ulcer completely heal use allogenic dermal graft versus standard protocol wound care diabetic patient diabetic foot ulcer adequate arterial perfusion , wound heal affected limb . The primary objective study compare proportion ulcer completely heal allogenic dermal graft protocol care standard protocol care management indolent diabetic ulcer 6 week . The secondary objective study compare proportion heal 4 week , 12 week , mean time heal . Patient sign IRB approve informed consent , upon meet inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize one two group . One group receive standard care protocol , offload boot , one group receive human allogenic dermis application , compressive dress offload boot . Patients see weekly complete healing occurs . Measurements take diabetic ulcer use centimeter ruler measure length width .</detailed_description>
