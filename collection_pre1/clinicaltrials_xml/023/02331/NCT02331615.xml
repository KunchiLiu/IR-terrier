	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) particularly affect frontal lobes patient often suffer executive dysfunction behavioral disturbance . These type injury often involve axonal damage pre frontal brain area , mediate various cognitive behavioral function . Dorsolateral prefrontal circuit lesion cause executive dysfunction , orbitofrontal circuit lesion lead personality change characterize disinhibition anterior cingulate circuit lesion present apathy . Patients suffer traumatic frontal lobe damage often demonstrate lasting , profound disturbance emotional regulation social cognition . Weak transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) induce persist excitability change human motor cortex . effect depend stimulation polarity specific site stimulation . Interacting cortical activity , mean cortical stimulation , positively affect short-term cognitive performance improve rehabilitation potential neurologic patient . In respect , preliminary evidence suggest cortical stimulation may play role treat aphasia , unilateral neglect , cognitive disorder . Several possible mechanism account effect tDCS method cognitive performance . They reflect potential method improve subject 's ability relearn acquire new strategy carry behavioral task . It also find Activation prefrontal cortex tDCS reduce appetite risk ambiguous decision making . In tDCS study investigator use one anode one cathode electrode place scalp modulate particular area central nervous system ( CNS ) . The stimulation administer via neuroConn DC.Stimulator Serial number 0096 . The DC-STIMULATOR micro-processor-controlled constant current source . The DC-STIMULATOR CE-certified medical device conduct non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) people.Electrode positioning determine accord International EEG 10-20 System .</brief_summary>
