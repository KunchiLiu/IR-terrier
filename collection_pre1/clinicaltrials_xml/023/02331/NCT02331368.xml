	<brief_summary>Multiple myeloma ( MM ) common incurable blood cancer cause debilitate symptoms-bone pain , kidney failure , low blood count infection . Chemotherapy outcomes disappointing due short-term response long-term toxicity . 1 . Studies show patient weak immune MM due immune checkpoint mediate PD1/PD-L1 interaction immune cell MM . Anti-PD-1 antibody ( anti-PD1 ) disrupt interaction , thus unleash immune cell function lead kill MM cell . 2 . Studies show enhancement `` unleash '' autologous transplant well MM control anti-PD1 use transplant . 3 . Anti-PD1 extensively study patient cancer . It safe effective FDA-approved . Complications mild degree easy manage successfully out-patient setting . Severe complication rare . Thus , propose efficacy study anti-PD1 treatment transplant improve MM treatment outcomes . This collaborative study Medical College Wisconsin ( headquarter Center International blood Marrow Transplant Research ) . We hypothesize anti-PD1 treatment increase MM response MM control duration add standard MM treatment transplant . Anti-PD1 give dose interval , study previously ( 200 mg intravenous injection every 3 week ) 2 week 6 month transplant . Subjects monitor closely anti-PD1 therapy least 1 year post transplant . Late complication follow 3 year .</brief_summary>
