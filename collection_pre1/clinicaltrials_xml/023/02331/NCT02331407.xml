	<brief_summary>Stroke lead cause neurological disability worldwide , often cause significant weaken paresis affect arm . National spending post-stroke rehabilitation project expand 20 % 35 % 2010 . As new tool therapist , robotic stroke therapy device potential cost-effective device aid physical therapy enable novel mode exercise currently available . While recent study show chronic patient benefit repetitive practice , clear whether improved via reduction impairment increase functional compensation lack standard treatment scale assess rehabilitation efficacy chronic stroke patient . This study aim reconcile difference performance measurement robotic rehabilitation ass outcome robotic rehabilitation training .</brief_summary>
