	<brief_title>Imaging Plan Workflow Novel Low-Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Radiotherapy Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , Viewray Inc ( Cleveland , OH ) release RenaissanceTM System 1000 , consist combination open , split solenoid 0.35 T MRI scanner equip parallel image 60Co gamma-ray radiation treatment unit . The MRI scanner require low field unit allow image spatial integrity limit magnetic susceptibility artifact due patient prevent significant perturbation dose distribution . The 0.35 T magnet variant Siemens MAGNETOM product use intraoperative imaging . A previous study pilot image use device without 60Co source complete 2012 ( HRPO # 201105295 ) . In study , total 26 patient imaged device . Fourteen patient also onboard CT imaging ( OB-CT ) two set image relative organ risk ( OARs ) could compare . Fifteen 24 OARs evaluate per anatomical site . In total , 221 OARs 10 target structure compare visualization MRI OB-CT image set physician . At least 2/3 physician evaluate MRI offer good visualization 71 % structure , OB-CT offering good visualization 10 % structure , offer equivalent visualization 14 % structure . Physicians agree unanimously 74 % majority &gt; 99 % structure evaluate , respectively . For &lt; 1 % structure , consensus reach . Targets well visualize MRI 4/10 case , never good visualize OB-CT image . There limitation prior study . The patient image immobilization device commonly use radiation therapy . This precluded creation mock radiation therapy plan use device patient . Also , device evaluate context radiation therapy decision making , patient shift , target localization patient reposition . The purpose study evaluate imaging plan workflow radiation therapy utilize novel device . For protocol , MRI scanner machine utilize . The 60Co portion machine capable radiation treatment administration utilize , experimental treatment modification patient 's standard care radiation treatment plan .</detailed_description>
