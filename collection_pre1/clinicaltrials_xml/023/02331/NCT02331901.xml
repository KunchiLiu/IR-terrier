	<brief_title>Cerebral Microstructural Changes Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There need clinical biological marker 2-3 month screen people risk get chronic post-concussion symptom ( PCS ) also biomarkers brain find group prolong symptom measurable change brain could explain persist symptom . Several biomarkers brain area investigate possible site injury mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) . The nature diffuse PCS make corpus callosum ( CC ) , thalamus ( THA ) hippocampus ( HIP ) interest central position connection widespread motor , sensory cognitive process brain area . In prior study conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) fail detect pathology especially later phase . Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging ( DKI ) Diffusional Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) sensitive microstructural change might serve biomarkers middle brain mTBI . It hypothesize difference microstructure thalamus , corpus callosum hippo campus measure DKI two group mTBI subject without PCS . Secondary hypothesize DKI sensitive DTI measure microstructural change .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Concussion cause head trauma accord diagnostic criterion recommend Danish Consensus Report Commotio Cerebri within last 25 month . The criterion base recommendation WHO Task Force , amendment , must direct contact head object order rule acceleration deceleration trauma . Age 18 30 year time head trauma . Able understand , speak read Danish . Patients symptoms least three item Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire ( RPQ ) rat moderate severe problem . PCS subjectively rat cause substantial impairment daily life . Patients symptom ( control ) problem RPQ . 1 . Objective neurological finding neurological examination / acute trauma CT scan , indicate neurological disease brain damage . Previous concussion lead persistent PCS within last two year . Severe misuse alcohol , prescription drug / illegal drug . Psychiatric morbidity severe neurological disease impede participation treatment , i.e . Bipolar Disorder , autism , psychotic disorder ( life time ) , multiple sclerosis etc.. Suitable MRI examination</criteria>
