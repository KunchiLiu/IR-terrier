	<brief_summary>Acute chronic HCV infection lead liver complication , include liver failure , cirrhosis liver cancer . For patient hepatitis C infection , major clinical question remain term treatment initiation . In Europe , new treatment available since approval three direct act antiviral . However high cost treatment , currently available critically ill patient . Other molecule currently advance clinical development phase . The use clinical predictor remain relevant selection suitable treatment patient , particular limit adverse effect reduce cost . Currently quantification viral load measure response treatment ; recommendation stop treatment patient fail achieve undetectable level viral load . Genetic factor also identify predictor response treatment , particular polymorphism IL-28B gene . Genotyping gene currently perform use classical PCR amplification apply DNA extract blood , time result 2-3 week . We propose protocol test non-invasive method rapid test IL-28B genotype could use point care test , ultimately well patient management . This monocenter , cross-sectional study among HCV chronic patient . The study conduct 250 HCV patient , viral genotype combine , Cochin Hospital ( Paris , France ) . Objectives The principal objective ass accuracy newly develop Point-of-Care genotyping assay ( GenedriveÂ® IL-28B Assay ) detect HCV patient genotype CC versus non CC ( i.e . CT TT ) TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay gold standard . The secondary objective ass concordance genotype result Genedrive gold standard regard three genotype CC , CT TT .</brief_summary>
