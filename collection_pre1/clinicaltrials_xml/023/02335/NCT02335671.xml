	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial investigate use intra-operative MRI MS breast cancer surgery . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . Prior research show intraoperative MRI MS two type test feasible use cancer surgery may able guide therapy . In study , evaluate accuracy intra-operative MRI MS determine whether cancer tissue remove breast surgery .</detailed_description>
