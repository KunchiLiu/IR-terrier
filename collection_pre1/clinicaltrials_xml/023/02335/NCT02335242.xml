	<brief_summary>A Phase 2 study evaluate safety efficacy sildenafil take orally improve resolve lymphatic malformation child . Subjects may receive either placebo treatment oral dosage open label extension subject receive placebo . The study treatment assignment randomize double blind fashion . MRI examination evaluate change lesion volume due treatment . Other safety efficacy measure take 32-week study duration . Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sildenafil Treatment Lymphatic Malformations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymphatic malformation ( LMs ) localize area abnormal development lymphatic system commonly occur head neck child . LMs consider rare orphan disease cause complication include pain , ulceration , secondary infection , infiltration organ , death . Current therapy involve surgical excision method chemical physical destruction portion lesion . No therapy uniformly effective risk significant adverse event . We recently witness almost complete resolution LM lesion child treat sildenafil oral therapy pulmonary arterial hypertension . We subsequently evaluate additional subject improve sildenafil . The goal clinical research trial document benefit absence benefit sildenafil therapy LMs identify type patient benefit sildenafil . This study double-blind placebo-controlled trial involves precise documentation volume change associate therapy placebo use MRI segmentation technique . We also observe document clinical response sildenafil placebo use clinical evaluation score survey . The result study identify characteristic LM lesion may suggest beneficial response sildenafil therapy . Sildenafil low risk side effect dosage use trial . Documentation effective response LMs sildenafil accelerate interest , ability understand , mechanism LM formation treatment .</detailed_description>
