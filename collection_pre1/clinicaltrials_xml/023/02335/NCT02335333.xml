	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study measure correlation baseline expression age biomarkers , SenesceTest blood organ donor renal graft function . This pilot study study patient undergoing renal transplantation organ extend criterion donor , standard criterion donor donation cardiac death compare ability SenesceTest predict renal graft function immediately transplant 1 year followup .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Presently , donate organ rank amongst base formula Kidney Donor Patient Index ( KDPI ; variation Donor Risk index ) 8 include donor demographic clinical history molecular marker kidney function serum creatinine . Using KDPI assessment , nearly ECD kidneys fall high-risk category . And ECD kidney associate high risk graft failure , study note wide variability ECD organ quality associate graft survival ( half-life graft survival 4.5-7.9 year ) , suggest current model assess organ quality inadequate . Furthermore , prior even assign KDPI , 37 % kidney 50 % ECD kidney discard base biopsy finding . However , recent study call question reliance procurement kidney biopsy report make acceptance decision demonstrate significant overlap biopsy finding discard transplanted kidney . The use ECD kidney become widespread , accord recent report , 70 % adult &gt; 65yo 50 % adult 50 64 yo willing accept ECD kidney . Therefore , new methodology assessment graft viability would increase transplantation rate particularly organ older expand criterion donor , shorten patient 's time wait list ( currently 45 month average 50 ) improve outcome take dialysis sooner . Here , propose new approachâ€”using molecular age marker ( collectively refer SenesceTest ) predict kidney graft function .</detailed_description>
