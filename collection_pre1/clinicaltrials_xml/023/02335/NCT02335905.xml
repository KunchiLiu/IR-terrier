	<brief_summary>This research study look antibiotic medicine , Ceftaroline Fosamil ( Ceftaroline ) , fights infection like one subject . Ceftaroline effective S.aureus germ include call Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA . ) Ceftaroline approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use adults Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia [ type lung infection ] Acute Bacterial Skin Skin Structure Infections . Ceftaroline study child simple complicate pneumonia FDA yet approve Ceftaroline use subject less 18 year age . Therefore , use Ceftaroline research study consider `` investigational '' . The goal research study find side effect may child take Ceftaroline study effective Ceftaroline treat bone infection due Staphylococcus aureus child . The investigator also study body study drug , Ceftaroline , dose investigator use result blood level investigator think go effective bone infection child . This call pharmacokinetics ( PK ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 1/2 , open-label , single-center study determine safety tolerability Ceftaroline pediatric subject 1 17 year age ( inclusive ) sign symptom acute hematogenous osteomyelitis end intravenous therapy . After informed consent/assent obtain , Ceftaroline administer intravenously . After subject afebrile least 48 hour , negative blood culture , clearly improve general , able eat drink , able use move involve extremity , subject may switch oral antibiotic administration . The duration subject participation signing informed consent form 14 month [ ( include screen period ( 1 Day ) , study IV drug administration ( approximately 2-14 Days ) , Standard Care Oral Drug Administration ( 4-5 week ) ( total maximum treatment period typically 6 week ) , follow-up visit 12 month last dose study drug ) ] . Baseline assessment study eligibility occur within 24 hour first dose study drug . A minimum 2 day ( 48 hour ) study drug administration require . Some test procedure complete study may part regular care subject 's condition . Some test procedures do study purpose . Some regular procedure may also complete often part research study . Study assessment : 1 . Past Current Medical History : A detailed review subject 's medical history , include demographic , concomitant medication review , medical/surgical history perform . 2 . Vital Signs : Weight , height , blood pressure , pulse rate , body temperature , record . 3 . Physical Exam : Physical exam include , evaluation subject 's overall health , examination site infection , assessment subject 's ability move affect limb . 4 . Safety Laboratory Assessments : Routine laboratory monitoring include liver function test do 24 hour prior enrollment weekly Ceftaroline treatment , completion Ceftaroline treatment follow-up visit . Isolate susceptibility test do baseline visit . 5 . Pregnancy testing : For female child-bearing potential , urine pregnancy perform prior complete antibiotic treatment . 6 . Pharmacokinetics Assessment : One PK blood sample obtain subject receive Ceftaroline fosamil .</detailed_description>
