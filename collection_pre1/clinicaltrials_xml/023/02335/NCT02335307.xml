	<brief_summary>This study examine effect genotype information pain management pain control patient treat family medicine clinic . This study also examine physician-perceived usefulness genotype information . Patients enrol family medicine clinic serve either implementation sit control site . Patients implementation sit undergo genotyping , control site genotyped .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Codeine tramadol opioid analgesic depend cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) bioactivation morphine O-desmethyltramadol , respectively . Morphine O-desmethyltramadol much great affinity opioid receptor thus powerful analgesic . Individuals genotype associate low CYP2D6 activity ( poor metabolizers ) unable convert sufficient amount codeine tramadol active metabolite may fail derive sufficient pain relief . At opposite extreme , individual genotype associate increased CYP2D6 activity ( ultra-rapid metabolizers ) risk serious toxicity usual codeine tramadol dos . The CYP2D6 genotype also implication response drug , tricyclic antidepressant ( TCAs ) , commonly use neuropathic pain . Patients recruit family medicine clinic , serve either implementation site control site . Patients implementation sit undergo CYP2D6 genotyping , result place medical record assist prescribe pain medication . Pain medication prescribe baseline 3 month assess medical record review . A pain assessment questionnaire administer patient enrol site baseline 3 month . At end study , 20-item survey administer physician implementation site . We assess whether CYP2D6 genotype result useful inform prescribing decision pain medication physician 's perspective . We also assess medicine prescribe patient enrol site 12-month period enrollment medical record review determine number patient prescribed medication genetic information FDA-approved label .</detailed_description>
