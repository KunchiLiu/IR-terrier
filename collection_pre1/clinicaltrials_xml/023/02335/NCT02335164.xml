	<brief_summary>Recombinant hemagglutinin show induce protective neutralising antibody avian influenza virus relatively non-immunogenic . An ideal pandemic avian influenza influenza vaccine would combine hemagglutinin antigen appropriate adjuvant increase immunogenicity . This Phase 1 study collect preliminary human safety efficacy data combine formulation recombinant hemagglutinin Advax adjuvant formulation administer intramuscular injection</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study Evaluate Immunogenicity Safety Pandemic Avian Influenza Vaccine Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study test new vaccine formulation pandemic avian influenza ( `` bird flu '' ) . Bird flu potentially deadly disease cause influenza virus bird . It common seasonal flu seasonal vaccine release around March year . To date , bird flu due H5N1 strain influenza virus infect 500 people mainly Asia result death half case . More recently outbreak another bird flu virus China know H9N7 also highly lethal infects human . Vaccination single effective measure prevent infection bird flu virus H5N1 H9N7 pandemic occur . In event major bird flu pandemic outbreak , vaccine supply likely limited , currently sufficient manufacturing capacity provide enough vaccine quickly whole population . Research need make pandemic flu vaccine effective also stretch vaccine supply use strategy call 'antigen-sparing ' . This potentially achieve use important ingredient call 'adjuvant ' . Adjuvants act stimulate immune system make vaccine effective . This study test Advax adjuvant base delta inulin combination recombinant hemagglutinin H5N1 influenza virus serotype .</detailed_description>
