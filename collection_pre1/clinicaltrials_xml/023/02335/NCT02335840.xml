	<brief_summary>Introduction : reduction blood pressure physical exercise call post exercise hypotension ( PEH ) . However , previous study demonstrate ingestion caffeine equivalent three tea-cup coffee abolishes phenomenon . Objective : evaluate influence different dos coffee PEH . Methods : eleven hypertensive perform four experimental session aerobic exercise cycle ergometer ( 40 minute duration , intensity 60 % 80 % maximum heart rate ) succeed ingestion one ( CAF-1 ) , two ( CAF-2 ) , three ( CAF-3 ) dose caffeinated coffee ( 144 mg/dose ) , three dos decaffeinate coffee ( DESC ) . Blood pressure measure rest 120 minute recovery post exercise , 10 minute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Volunteers : participate 12 volunteer diagnose hypertensive , gender ( three men ) , 40 55 year old , overweight practitioner aerobic exercise ( walk ) least three month . They treat anti-hypertensive medication class beta-adrenergic receptor blocker , thiazide enzyme convertor angiotensin inhibitor , show systolic diastolic pressoric value control habituated coffee consumption . Would exclude study volunteer present migraine withdrawal symptom due washout carry coffee caffeinated food . The volunteer participate study average one month . This study previously approve Ethic Committee Search Humans Hospital Lauro Wanderley , Federal University Paraiba , protocol 21/2011 . All volunteer previously clarify experimental procedure , sign write informed consent accord resolution 466/12 Health National Council ( Brazil ) . Design Study : study experimental , randomized double-blind . Before experimental session volunteer instruct avoid caffeinated food 48 hour . They perform four experimental session practice aerobic exercise , succeed ingestion caffeinated decaffeinated coffee , accord follow protocol : 1 ) one dose 150 ml coffee ( 144 mg caffeine ) ingest 10 minute post-exercise ( CAF-1 ) ; 2- two dos 150 ml coffee ( 2x144 mg caffeine ) ingest 10 20 minute post-exercise ( CAF-2 ) ; three dose 150ml coffee ( 3x 144 mg caffeine ) ingest 10 , 20 30 minute post-exercise ( CAF-3 ) ; 4- three dose 150 ml decaffeinate coffee ( 108 mg caffeine ) ingest 10 , 20 30 minute post-exercise ( DESC ) . The order realization experimental session determine randomly site www.randomizer.org . They remain seat 120 minute exercise . Blood pressure evaluate rest , 120 minute post-exercise recovery , 10 minute . Preparation Ingestion coffee : utilized one caffeinated decaffeinated coffee ( São Braz , Cabedelo , Brazil ) one serial number . Caffeinated decaffeinate coffee 1,2 % 0,3 % caffeine , respectively , composition . The method adopt preparation caffeinated decaffeinated coffee previously utilized Nóbrega et al . ( 15 ) . Were prepared addition 40g coffee powder 500 ml heat water five minute , limited beginning boil . Thus , volume 500 ml coffee one concentration 480 mg caffeine . Considering tea-cup ingested one volume 150 ml , one , two three tea-cups coffee respectively 144 mg , 288 mg 432 mg caffeine . Three tea-cups decaffeinate coffee 108 mg caffeine . The dos caffeinated decaffeinated coffee sweeten sugar ( Alegre , Mamanguape , Brazil ) . The coffee strain filter paper ( Mellita® , Minden , Alemanha ) . To ensure accuracy volume intake volunteer time utilized one dose tea-cup previously calibrate volume one tea-cup ( 150 ml ) . The intake coffee perform first 30 minute period recovery , 10 minute . During moment ingestion , volunteer stay seat stipulated deadline five minute intake coffee . Protocol Physical Exercise : volunteer perform four experimental session aerobic exercise stationary bicycle ( Perform V3 , Movement® , Pompeia , Sao Paulo ) , last 40 minute , intensity 60 80 % maximum heart rate ( MHR ) . To estimate MHR utilized equation propose Bruce et al . ( 16 ) . To prescription target zone exercise adopt protocol propose Karvonen et al . ( 17 ) . The heart rate rest exercise evaluate utilizing cardiofrequencymeter ( RS800CX , Polar Electro® Oy , Kempele , Finland ) Measures Blood Pressure : volunteer arrive laboratory , orient stay rest seat 10 minute measure blood pressure end period . Others measure realize 120 minute post-exercise recovery , 10minutes . The first 30 minute post-exercise recovery measure always perform one minute coffee administration . The blood pressure measure auscultatory method , follow protocol propose VI Brazilian Guidelines Arterial Hypertension ( 18 ) . For , utilized one sphygmomanometer ( Missouri , Embu , Brasil ) , previously calibrate one mercury column one stethoscope ( Missouri , Embu , Brasil ) . Statistical Analysis : data present mean±standard-error mean . All variable test normal distribution use Shapiro-Wilk Levene test . For comparison age , body mass index , heart rate rest , systolic diastolic blood pressure rest experimental session utilized one-way ANOVA . For comparison systolic diastolic post-exercise experimental session study realize two-way ANOVA plus Bonferroni test post hoc . P value small 0,05 consider statically significant .</detailed_description>
