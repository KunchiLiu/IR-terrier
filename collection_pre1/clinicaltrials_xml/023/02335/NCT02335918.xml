	<brief_summary>This study determine clinical benefit ( well drug work ) , safety , tolerability combine varlilumab nivolumab ( also know Opdivo® , BMS-936558 ) . Both drug target immune system may act promote anti-cancer effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Escalation Cohort Expansion Study Anti-CD27 ( Varlilumab ) Anti-PD-1 ( Nivolumab ) Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Varlilumab fully human monoclonal antibody bind molecule call CD27 find certain immune cell may act promote anti-tumor effect . Nivolumab full human monoclonal antibody bind molecule call PD-1 immune cell promote anti-tumor effect . Eligible patient enroll dose escalation portion study assign one three dose level varlilumab combination 3 mg/kg nivolumab . The first phase study test safety profile combination determine dose study Phase overall study . During Phase , depend cancer type , group patient enrol receive varlilumab dose either 3 mg/kg every 2 week , 3 mg/kg every 12 week , 0.3 mg/kg every 4 week 3.0 mg/kg combination nivolumab 240 mg. All patient enrol study closely monitor determine response treatment well side effect may occur .</detailed_description>
