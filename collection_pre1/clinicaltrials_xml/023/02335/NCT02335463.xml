	<brief_title>3D Single Cell Analysis Using Cell Morphology Organelle Scattering Texture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Achieved formalin-fixed paraffin embed tissue specimen colon cancer and/or benign pre-cancer colon lesion well melanoma and/or benign pigment skin lesion use . The achieved specimen keep Department Pathology , National Taiwan University Hospital . Sections achieve pathological specimen put glass slide tissue image observe 3D optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . The 3D optic tomography system utilize Ce : YAG optical fiber light source also combine confocal microscopy . Taken together , feature make 3D optic tomography system high resolution suitable single cell image . This study interfere normal medical practice impact patient 's safety health . All material destroy experiment do . The enrollment criterion patient underwent colon/skin surgery examination NTUH pathological specimen take stored NTUH .</detailed_description>
