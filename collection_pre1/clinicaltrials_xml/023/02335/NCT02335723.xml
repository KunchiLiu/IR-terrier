	<brief_title>ASSET - Double-Blind , Randomized Placebo-Controlled Clinical Investigation With Alteco® LPS Adsorber</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OVERALL CLINICAL INVESTIGATION DESIGN : This multicentre , stratify , parallel , double-blinded , randomize , Phase IIa , feasibility clinical investigation Alteco® LPS Adsorber . Subjects enrol adaptive fashion two interim analysis , possibility recruit additional patient , order establish indication feasibility treat target population subject septic shock endotoxemia . Subjects stratify accordance origin infection , i.e . abdominal urogenital sepsis . Subjects stratum receive either : - LPS Adsorber group ( i.e . investigational medical device [ IMD ] group ) : current best practice combination Alteco® LPS Adsorber treatment , OR - Placebo device group ( i.e . comparator group ) : current best practice combination placebo adsorber treatment . Allocation either treatment arm perform 1:1 ratio . Upon enrolment ( i.e . pre-treatment phase ) , subject admit ICU suspect endotoxemia screen fulfilment `` Illness Severity Criteria '' confirm early stage severe sepsis . Within six ( 6 ) hour enrolment , subject also fulfil `` Treatment Criteria '' confirm septic shock eligible randomization . Randomization either treatment group perform close possible start treatment Alteco® LPS Adsorber placebo device . Treatment LPS Adsorber placebo device must initiate within six ( 6 ) hour ( Day 1 ) follow fulfilment `` Treatment Criteria '' . A second device treatment perform 24 hour end first device treatment Day 2 , long evidence treatment investigational device beneficial indicate unnecessary risk subject ( example , subject vasopressor support-free ) . Initially : 20 abdominal sepsis subject ( Stratum A ) 12 urogenital sepsis subject ( Stratum B ) Optional : additional 12 subject ( abdominal , urogenital ) interim analysis decision .</detailed_description>
