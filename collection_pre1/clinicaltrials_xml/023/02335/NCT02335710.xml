	<brief_summary>Smith &amp; Nephew 's first edition Journey posterior stabilize total knee arthroplasty analyze Center Musculoskeletal Research past research study , determine subject experience normal-like kinematic pattern . They also achieve excessive axial rotation decrease weight-bearing knee flexion . Since Smith &amp; Nephew make modification Journey bi-cruciate stabilizing ( BCS ) total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) design , researcher evaluate kinematics subject implant revised design determine subject experience normal-like kinematic pattern great weight-bearing knee flexion achieve . The objective study analyze vivo kinematics subject implant 2nd generation Journey BCS TKA compare pattern subject normal knee 1st generation Journey posterior stabilizing ( PS ) TKA analyze previous study .</brief_summary>
