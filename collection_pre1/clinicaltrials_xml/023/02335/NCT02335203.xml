	<brief_summary>Objective : To compare pre- post-treatment glandular cellularity woman complex atypical hyperplasia grade 1-2 endometrial adenocarcinoma treat intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate ( DMPA ) versus placebo injection prior hysterectomy . The secondary objective compare various outcome include molecular , histologic , pathologic clinical endpoint woman treat DMPA versus placebo prior hysterectomy . Hypothesis : Patients treat DMPA significantly decrease glandular cellularity post-treatment compare patient treat placebo injection . Patients treat DMPA exhibit previously describe change molecular tumor marker expression pattern characteristic histologic change . Patients treat DMPA report le bothersome vaginal bleeding prior surgery compare patient treat placebo injection . Study Design : Double blind randomize control trial Population : Women treat Women Infants Program Women 's Oncology biopsy-proven diagnosis complex atypical hyperplasia grade 1-2 endometrial adenocarcinoma disease clinically confine uterus , plan undergo hysterectomy . Study Period : February 2015 June 2016</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION : Recently , multiple modality progesterone analogue investigate successfully used treat complex atypical hyperplasia ( CAH ) stage 1A , grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma . This body research focus pre-menopausal woman primary goal preserve fertility delay avoid surgical therapy . Across multiple case series , average time complete response ( CR : typically define absence hyperplasia , atypia neoplasia follow-up biopsy specimen ) 5-9 month 60-70 % overall complete response rate approximately 50 % durable complete response rate ( defined complete histologic response relapse disease period time study ) . There publish randomize controlled trial evaluate modality progesterone therapy efficacious , consistent retrospective data suggest superiority give progesterone analogue method administration . Multiple pathologic predictor complete response progesterone therapy identify . In recent study , Gunderson find interval decrease glandular cellularity endometrial biopsy treatment progesterone therapy independent predictor future complete response . While decrease mitotic index decrease glandular cellularity significant finding study , decrease glandular cellularity independently predictive future complete response multivariate analysis . Despite grow body evidence support safety feasibility progesterone analogues medical management CAH early-stage endometrial adenocarcinoma , little known potential role neoadjuvant chemotherapy . A recent multicenter collaborative trial coordinate Gynecologic Oncology Group evaluate effect 400mg intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate administer 21-24 day prior schedule hysterectomy endometrioid adenocarcinoma uterus . Upon compare patient ' post-hysterectomy slide pre-treatment slide , study find partial histologic response rate 63 % among 59 study subject use pre-defined criterion modify Wheeler 2007 . A down-regulation progesterone receptor , progesterone receptor beta , Bcl-2 , Ki-67 also note post-hysterectomy specimen , low pre-treatment level Ki-67 significantly associate increased likelihood histologic response . No clinical data patient characteristic , final tumor stage , specific surgical procedure ( ie lymphadenectomy ) collect . The question progesterone analogues neoadjuvant chemotherapy especially important give recent data show delayed time surgery endometrial cancer ( define great 12 week ) significantly associate decreased 5-year survival rate . The group author also find , alarmingly , wait time province Ontario , Canada double 2000 2009 . In study , half hysterectomy perform endometrial cancer within recommended limit six week diagnosis surgery . Considering data , treatment progesterone analogue prior hysterectomy view either maintenance therapy temporize measure , primary goal prevent disease progression await surgery rather curative intent . This potential application progesterone analogue may particularly relevant setting woman expect long wait time prior definitive surgical management . There empiric basis usage DMPA , one particularly intriguing study find vivo injection MPA elevate expression know metastasis suppressor gene murine breast cancer model . Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate safe , well-studied well-tolerated method contraception use globally since 1960s . It require refrigeration safely administer remote setting poor infrastructure , demonstrate widespread use contraception develop world . A history use DMPA contraception believe World Health Organization reduce prevalence endometrial cancer 80 % , protective period least 8 year cessation . Apart GOG 211 , depot medroxyprogesterone acetate 's role potential neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic agent study isolation ; rather group progesterone analogue retrospective trial fertility-sparing agent CAH endometrial cancer . Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate use 150mg dose contraception , however use high dos 1000mg weekly several month set malignancy short-term side effect note study . More recently , single dose 400mg DMPA compare venlafaxine treat woman bothersome hot flash ; 6 week DMPA superior reduce hot flash associate less short-term toxicity . GOG 211 use one-time 400mg dose maximal progestin effect . DATA COLLECTION/INTERPRETATION : All data collect research assistant study physician . The study drug administer patient 's first visit Program Women 's Oncology decision make undergo hysterectomy complex atypical hyperplasia grade 1 grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma . Prior injection study drug , questionnaire complete patient identify factor may influence histologic response depot medroxyprogesterone acetate well baseline demographic information : age , race/ethnicity , education level , gravidity parity , height/weight body mass index , diabetes , hypertension , polycystic ovarian syndrome , history irregular menses , history oral contraceptive use , menopausal status , age menarche , family history uterine ovarian malignancy , family history colorectal cancer , smoke history , personal history malignancy type , history abnormal uterine bleeding duration , recent weight loss , recent symptom abdominal distension , recent symptom nausea/vomiting . FACILITIES : All patient relate aspect study transpire Women Infants Program Women 's Oncology outpatient clinic , Women Infants Hospital inpatient facility , Women Infants Pathology Department . Data initially collect patient 's first visit Women Infants Program Women 's Oncology decision make proceed hysterectomy . Data collect one time patient prepare surgery inpatient Women Infants Hospital . Biopsy specimens hysterectomy specimen review two study pathologist Women Infants Hospital Department Pathology . Data processing interpretation take place Women Infants Hospital conjunction Division Research . CONFIDENTIALITY : The patient enrol study ask permission access medical record . To ensure patient confidentiality , form mark participant ID number , key contain identify information keep separately lock cabinet research personnel access . Electronic data store Care New England file server , file server locate physically secure data center . Access Care New England data center card-controlled access server room record . Care New England computer account management policy practice ensure computer access study database limit key study personnel . SAFETY : Study personnel meet review safety issue logistics 25 % , 50 % 75 % recruitment . Adverse event complication record data collection sheet review PI roll basis . Any adverse event associate depot medroxyprogesterone acetate use report IRB FDA PI co-investigators . Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate routinely used medication birth control medical treatment uterine fibroid early endometrial cancer .</detailed_description>
