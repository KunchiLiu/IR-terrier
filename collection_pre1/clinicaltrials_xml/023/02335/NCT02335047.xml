	<brief_summary>Passive flexion trunk ( relative leg ) may accompany contraction psoas muscle , even subject tell contract muscle . The psoas contraction involuntary control subject . This lack passivity might concomitant low back pain : impairment may present low back pain present and/or absent low back pain absent . The study 's primary objective thus determine sensitivity and/or specificity clinical test impair hip flexor passivity case low back pain passive flexion trunk ( supine position , ) . The secondary objective show negative test ( administration correct measure ) correlate decrease pain ( i.e . pain intensity functional repercussion pain ) .</brief_summary>
