	<brief_summary>There currently license drug EU treat thrombocytopenia MDS patient classify IPSS low/int-1 . Prior study romiplostim ( TPO receptor agonist ) MDS find baseline concentration TPO well transfusion history predictive subsequent response retrospective model . The current prospective study aim explore whether pretreatment variable ( endogenous TPO , TPO-level , platelet transfusion history ) predict response subsequent short-term treatment romiplostim .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VALIDATION OF A PREDICTIVE MODEL OF RESPONSE TO ROMIPLOSTIM IN PATIENTS WITH IPSS LOW OR INTERMEDIATE-1 RISK MDS AND THROMBOCYTOPENIA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) heterogeneous group hematologic malignancy pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell characterize clonal hematopoiesis , progressive bone marrow failure , propensity transform acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) ( Malcovati et al. , 2013 ) . There currently license drug EU treat thrombocytopenia MDS patient classify IPSS low/int-1 . Prior study romiplostim ( TPO receptor agonist ) MDS find baseline concentration TPO well transfusion history predictive subsequent response retrospective model . Classically , MDS associate apoptosis excessive proliferation , result combination hyper-cellular marrow peripheral cytopenia . The rationale use romiplostim MDS stimulate normal progenitor cell increase platelet count . Upon correction thrombocytopenia , respond MDS patient decrease risk bleed reduction platelet transfusion ( Giagounidis et al. , 2014 ) . This reduction platelet transfusion may turn decrease risk alloimmunization resultant morbidity cost associated condition .</detailed_description>
