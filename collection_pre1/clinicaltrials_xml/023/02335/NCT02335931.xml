	<brief_summary>The project concern type debilitate diabetic foot complication call Charcots osteoarthropathy ( COA ) . This disease characterize rapidly progress destruction load bearing joint , primarily foot , result loss structure remodel . Untreated cascade lead collapse bone , mean severe pain walk disability patient . Reconstruction often difficult impossible , furthermore collapse lead chronic foot ulcer infection , bad case fatal . Treatment option currently limit early diagnosis physical offloading ( immobilisation ) , assist wound heal surgical intervention . The purpose project investigate describe bone-related factor , separate COA , less acute , diabetic foot change . The investigator wish describe long term consequence COA - anatomically , physiologically biochemically . The investigator follow-up investigation group COA patient test 8 year ago . Little known long term change bone structure acute COA , investigator want visualize extend bone damage permanent . To investigator use DXA-scans , x-ray , blood test include bone marker , neurophysiological test occlusion plethysmography .</brief_summary>
