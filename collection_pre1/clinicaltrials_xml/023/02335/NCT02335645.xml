	<detailed_description>Each year , 250,000 Anterior Cruciate Ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction perform United States . ( 1 ) Individuals undergo ACL reconstruction vary weekend warrior high level professional athlete . With majority ACL injury occur sport injury , return run key portion rehabilitation process . ( 2 ) Following ACL tear , knee laxity instability common complaint . Due , individual classify coper non-copers . ( 3 ) Copers individual able maintain previous function conservative treatment . Non-copers person unable return previous level activity due instability perform high level activity . Non-copers undergo ACL reconstruction surgery , follow lengthy rehabilitation process . ( 3 ) With extensive knowledge run mechanic , important consider normal mechanic follow ACL surgery . ( 4 , 5 ) Following ACL surgery rehabilitation , several variance gait pattern know exist 6 month great . Several Studies demonstrate abnormal knee torque follow ACL surgery well 6 month . ( 6 ) With know deficit last several month , must consider mechanic return sport criterion return athlete sport competition . With high risk reinjury first several month , understand gait mechanic risk factor vital successful ACL rehabilitation . ( 6 ) As clinician , important aspect consider rehabilitation successful athlete 's full return sport activity choice , high level . In order , must understand area mechanic limit deficit throughout process . Over time , ACL protocols progressively change standard conservative plan , accelerate protocol , return run around 6 month . ( 7 ) This nearly twice fast conservative plan . As time return sport participation continue decrease , understand mechanic correct deficit important overall successful surgery , rehabilitation , patient . The ability progressively decrease treatment time make possible increased knowledge ever improve technology . One piece technology allow decrease rehabilitation time use body weight support treadmill allow much quick return run , within limitation protocol . One example AlterG , Anti-Gravity treadmill . This treadmill allow patient run little 20 % body weight use air pressure system unweighting . This type unweighting allow safe normal gait mechanic , pain free system . This type treadmill also allow clinician adjust monitor change improvements patient progress treatment . ( 8 ) The purpose case series ass novel treatment body weight support treadmill use early rehabilitation protocol address run deficit mechanic within standard care . The primary objective determine early run use body weight support , result decrease pain high feeling success early rehabilitation process . The secondary objective study determine run mechanic alter use body weight support , follow ACL reconstruction surgery . This single site study perform Westerville Close Home Sports Physical Therapy Location . This case series ass run mechanic follow ACL surgery use standard body weight support treadmill . Patients refer Westerville follow ACL reconstruction surgery offer opportunity participate study . Patients begin standard protocol first 3-4 week approach participate study . At time , progress well protocol , approach ask would like information regard study . After explain study answer patient parent question , informed consent assent obtain individual wish participate . The participant screen see meet inclusion criterion time . If patient meet criteria agreeable participate study , standard protocol continue follow week six . Standard care continue treatment except four visit , occur week 6,8,10 , 12 , video record run gait mechanic perform analysis biomechanics throughout rehabilitation process . At week 6 , pretreatment evaluation measure perform . These consist : - Pediatric International Knee Document Committee ( Pedi-IKDC ) self-reported questionnaire relate young patient function , symptom , sport activity . This valid study patient age 10-18 . ( 1 ) - Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) patient report outcome measure intend use knee injury may result osteoarthritis anterior cruciate reconstruction . This measure valid individual 's age 13-79 year consist 5 subscales . ( 2 ) - The use Numerical Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) assess pain validate use adolescent patient find minimal detectable change 2 point . The NPRS administer begin end every treatment session . ( 3 ) - Manual Muscle Testing ( MMT ) administer use hand hold dynamometer . This perform hip flexion , extension , abduction adduction . MMT also perform knee flexion extension , well ankle plantar flexion , dorsiflexion , inversion , eversion . ( 4 ) - Range Motion Testing well also complete time , measure hip , knee ankle movement . Treatment intervention start record gait mechanic use AlterG body weight support treadmill . Following pretreatment evaluation , patient prepare use body weight support treadmill . The patient wear appropriate short associate treadmill base waist size . At time , reflective marker place anatomical position . The marker position include : Tibial tuberosity , mid patella , anterior mid thigh , lateral mid thigh , lateral knee joint line , lateral malleoli , fibula head , lateral calcaneus , lateral fifth metatarsal head , lumbar spine ( L3 ) iliac crest . These marker later use mechanic analysis software determine run biomechanics . After marker place , patient enter AlterG body weight support treadmill . After treadmill calibrates , begin first walk-jog progression . The following setting use first run base standard protocol . - 60 % Body weight - 1 minute walk/2 minute jog ( repeat 3 time ) - 1 % incline - Walk : 3.0mph - Run : Desired speed choice After completion , marker remove patient begin standard physical therapy ( PT ) care per protocol . Standard PT care continue week 6-8 focus patient deficit progression per protocol . Patient continue use AlterG treadmill record time . The AlterG set continually progress able . At 8 week , patient record AlterG body weight support treadmill . The patient get prepare use body weight support treadmill . The patient wear appropriate short associate treadmill base waist size . At time , reflective marker place anatomical position . These marker later use mechanic analysis software determine run biomechanics . After marker place , patient enter AlterG body weight support treadmill . After treadmill calibrates , begin first walk-jog progression . The following setting use first run base standard protocol . - 75 % Body weight - 1 minute walk/4 minute jog ( repeat 3 time ) - 1 % incline - Walk : 3.0mph - Run : Desired speed choice Standard physical therapy care continue week 8-10 focus patient deficit progression per protocol . Patient continue use AlterG treadmill record time . At 10 week , patient record treadmill use change standard treadmill body weight support . At time , reflective marker place anatomical position . These marker later use mechanic analysis software determine run biomechanics . After marker place , patient begin run treadmill per standard protocol . The following setting use first run standard treadmill base standard protocol . - 1 minute walk/2 minute jog ( repeat 3 time ) - 1 % incline - Walk : 3.0mph - Run : Desired speed choice Standard PT care continue week 10-12 focus patient deficit progression per protocol . Patient continue use standard treadmill record time . At 12 week , patient record standard treadmill body weight support . At time , reflective marker place anatomical position . These marker later use mechanic analysis software determine run biomechanics . After marker place , patient begin run treadmill per standard protocol . The following setting use first run standard treadmill base standard protocol . - 1 minute walk/ 5 minute jog ( repeat 3 time ) - 1 % incline - Walk : 3.0mph - Run : Desired speed choice Following 4th record , patient complete research study . The patient repeat outcome measure pretreatment test time . Testing include : - Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score - Pediatric International Knee Disability Committee - Manual muscle test use hand hold dynamometer - Range motion use goniometer - Functional testing also perform time . Following 12 week therapy , functional test typically do ass progress . Functional testing time include three different test : - Single Leg hop test : - Triple Hop Test : - Triple Crossover Hop Test : At time , standard care continue possible discharge functional rehabilitation continue PT care base progress functional status . Throughout standard visit , patient see 45-90 minute 2 time per week . Treatment time vary patient progress rehabilitation protocol .</detailed_description>
