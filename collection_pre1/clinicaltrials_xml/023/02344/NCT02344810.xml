	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I/II trial study side effect best dose c-Met inhibitor AMG 337 give together oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil see well work treat patient stomach esophageal cancer spread place body usually cure controlled treatment . C-Met inhibitor AMG 337 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , , oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving c-Met inhibitor AMG 337 oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity combination therapy AMG 337 ( c-Met inhibitor AMG 337 ) mFOLFOX6 ( oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil ) chemotherapy patient advance metastatic gastrointestinal ( GI ) cancer . ( Phase I ) II . To determine dose AMG 337 use combination mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy phase II portion trial . ( Phase I ) III . To determine pharmacokinetics AMG 337 combination mFOLFOX6 . ( Phase I ) IV . To determine addition AMG 337 mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy improve median progression-free survival ( PFS ) first line treatment patient human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( Her2Neu ) negative high c-met proto-oncogene ( MET ) express advanced esophagogastric gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) adenocarcinoma . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate addition AMG 337 mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy also evaluate placebo/mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy combination first line treatment patient Her2Neu negative high c-MET express advanced esophagogastric GEJ adenocarcinoma , regard overall survival ( OS ) . ( Phase II ) II . To evaluate addition AMG 337 mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy also evaluate placebo/mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy combination first line treatment patient Her2Neu negative high c-MET express advanced esophagogastric GEJ adenocarcinoma , regard response rate disease control rate . ( Phase II ) III . To evaluate addition AMG 337 mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy also evaluate placebo/mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy combination first line treatment patient Her2Neu negative high c-MET express advanced esophagogastric GEJ adenocarcinoma , regard toxicity rate . ( Phase II ) IV . To evaluate addition AMG 337 mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy also evaluate placebo/mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy combination first line treatment patient Her2Neu negative high c-MET express advanced esophagogastric GEJ adenocarcinoma , regard time development new metastasis . ( Phase II ) V. To evaluate addition AMG 337 mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy also evaluate placebo/mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy combination first line treatment patient Her2Neu negative high c-MET express advanced esophagogastric GEJ adenocarcinoma , regard evaluation MET amplification . ( Phase II ) VI . To evaluate addition AMG 337 mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy also evaluate placebo/mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy combination first line treatment patient Her2Neu negative high c-MET express advanced esophagogastric GEJ adenocarcinoma , regard evaluation MET amplification MET expression determine DAKO immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) comparison Ventana IHC . ( Phase II ) VII . To evaluate addition AMG 337 mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy also evaluate placebo/mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy combination first line treatment patient Her2Neu negative high c-MET express advanced esophagogastric GEJ adenocarcinoma , regard retrospective re-evaluation cutpoint use computer algorithm c-MET IHC ass ability distinguish respond versus non-responding patient undertaken population , potentially optimal cutpoint define high c-MET tumor patient identify . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study c-Met inhibitor AMG 337 follow phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive c-Met inhibitor AMG 337 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 ; oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV 46-48 hour day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive c-Met inhibitor AMG 337 PO QD day 1-28 ; oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV 46-48 hour day 1 15 . ARM B : Patients receive placebo PO QD day 1-28 ; oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV 46-48 hour day 1 15 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
