	<brief_title>Evaluating Use Pitavastatin Reduce Risk Cardiovascular Disease HIV-Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , strategy prevent CVD HIV-infected people , even though high risk develop CVD . Statin medication use low cholesterol may effective reduce risk CVD people infect HIV . The purpose study evaluate use pitavastatin reduce risk CVD adult infect HIV ART . This study enroll adult infect HIV ART regimen ( ART provide study ) least 6 month study entry consider low-to-moderate risk use 2013 American College Cardiology ( ACC ) /American Heart Association ( AHA ) guideline threshold recommend statin initiation . Total study duration approximately 72 month time first participant enrol . Participants randomly assign receive 4 mg pitavastatin placebo day entire time enrol study . Study visit occur study entry ( Day 0 ) Months 1 4 . Starting Month 4 , study visit occur every 4 month rest study . Depending participant enroll , study total 3 Â½ 6 year . Study visit include medical medication history review , physical examination , blood collection , assessment questionnaire , urine collection ( participant ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ( study entry ) . Some participant option enrol substudy ( Effects Pitavastatin Coronary Artery Disease Inflammatory Biomarkers : Mechanistic Substudy REPRIEVE [ A5333s ] ) . The substudy evaluate effect pitavastatin progression non-calcified coronary atherosclerotic plaque ( NCP ) inflammatory biomarkers adult infect HIV . Participants substudy attend study visit study entry Months 4 24 . The visit include questionnaire assessment , blood collection , coronary compute tomography angiography ( CCTA ) .</detailed_description>
