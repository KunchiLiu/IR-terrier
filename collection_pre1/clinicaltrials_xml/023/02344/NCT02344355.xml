	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Trial High-Dose Ascorbate Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard treatment glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) involve maximum safe surgical resection follow radiation combine temozolomide ( chemotherapy pill take mouth ) . After radiation , patient receive additional cycle temozolomide ( adjuvant chemotherapy ) . Participants : - receive high dos intravenous ( IV ) ascorbate three time week combine radiation chemotherapy phase - receive high dos intravenous ( IV ) ascorbate twice week adjuvant chemotherapy ( radiation ) - complete health-related quality life questionnaires pre-radiation , 4 week radiation , 4 week radiation , every 3 month . In addition , patient complete neurocognitive test pre-radiation , 4 week radiation , 4 week radiation , approximately 9 month initiate radiation therapy . The adjuvant chemotherapy portion study last 6 month . After complete , participant go back standard therapy cancer . Participants continue life-long follow-up study .</detailed_description>
