	<brief_summary>The left ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) grow rapidly among people die end-stage heart failure unable get heart transplant . These patient elect live remainder live dependent partial artificial heartâ€”so-called destination therapy ( DT ) . Although patient may live long DT LVAD , pose many risk , include stroke , serious infection , bleed . Most patient medical problem fix DT LVAD . Patients must connect electricity time . A caregiver require , often place stress love one . Therefore , decision whether get DT LVAD often extremely difficult one . Unfortunately , research show problem way medical decision currently make hospital across United States . Hospitals offer DT LVAD treatment follow standard process . The form , pamphlet , website , video use help patient family bias difficult people understand . Lastly , emotional even scary decision patient family , process help deal feeling . Using feedback patient , caregiver , clinician , study team make paper video decision aid help people offer DT LVAD make difficult decision . Unlike information available , decision aid focus option , fear , need caregiver , balance , pair training doctor nurse best talk DT LVAD . The investigator propose test effectiveness implementation intervention . The investigator apply Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation , Maintenance ( RE-AIM ) evaluative framework stepped-wedge , cluster-randomized , controlled trial across 6 medical center . Aim 1 . Evaluate Reach Effectiveness DT LVAD share decision support intervention improve patient caregiver experience . Hypothesis 1a : The intervention reach 90 % eligible patient . Hypothesis 1b : Post-implementation , patient caregiver improve decision quality ( great knowledge high value-treatment concordance ) . Aim 2 . Assess Adoption , Implementation , Maintenance DT LVAD share decision support intervention across multiple provider setting . Hypothesis 2 : The intervention : adopt key personnel ; implement consistently ; maintain trial completion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator plan test effectiveness implementation share decision support intervention DT LVAD . Six DT LVAD program across U.S. participate stepped-wedge randomize study design . In design , site participates control intervention phase time transition randomly assign . Sites begin control phase , usual care consist current education , decision making , informed consent process . When sit reach randomly assign time transition intervention , coordinator key staff participate communication train decision coaching . The pamphlet video decision aid formally integrated exist education , decision making , informed consent process . In pre- post-phases , investigator enroll patient caregiver survey prior DT LVAD decision ( baseline ) 1 month 6 month determine intervention effect decision quality host secondary outcome . These patient- caregiver-centered outcome compare within hospital implementation determine effectiveness intervention . The investigator also survey clinician , , implementation share decision support intervention . The implementation guide use well-known RE-AIM evaluative framework ( Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation , Maintenance ) . Formal study implementation promote widespread dissemination DT LVAD share decision support .</detailed_description>
