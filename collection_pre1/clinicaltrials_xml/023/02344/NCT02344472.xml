	<brief_summary>A multicenter , randomize phase III study compare chemo- versus endocrine therapy combination dual HER2-targeted therapy Herceptin® ( trastuzumab ) Perjeta® ( pertuzumab ) patient HER2 positive hormone-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Especially diseases curable metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) , maintenance quality life one main aim treatment . Adverse event well-known side effect cytostatic treatment impact patient ' quality life . Therefore , new treatment option develop stop least slow metastatic spread cancer without cause negative side effect term high-grade adverse event . For patient hormone-receptor positive HER2 positive MBC combination HER2-targeted therapy endocrine therapy already proven effective many case valuable alternative combination HER2-targeted therapy chemotherapy . The high relevance HER2-neu-targeted/endocrine treatment combination derive fact potential chemotherapy-related toxicity avoid , turn positively affect quality life.The combination dual HER2-targeted therapy trastuzumab pertuzumab plus endocrine therapy might offer good treatment option patient HER2 positive hormone-receptor positive MBC . However , combination evaluate compare combination dual HER2-targeted plus chemotherapy prospective randomize phase III clinical trial .</detailed_description>
