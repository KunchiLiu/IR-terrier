	<brief_summary>Recent study support use Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) treatment localized prostate cancer ( PrCa ) . SBRT way deliver radiation precisely allow high dos deliver few treatment , potentially improve patient outcome . Cyberknife Volume Modulated Arc Therapy ( VMAT ) accept SBRT technique . However , effect specific SBRT treatment technique patient outcomes evaluate randomized trial . Although trial would great interest , patient ' willingness participate unclear . Multiple patient clinician factor contribute decision enter randomize trial . This feasibility study evaluate patient ' willingness participate trial compare Cyberknife VMAT SBRT treatment early stage PrCa . Patients accept enrolment randomize one two type SBRT delivery . Up 66 patient approach , 40 randomize . A questionnaire help identify factor influence patient 's decision participate . This study gather information feasibility , PSA control , patient outcome side effect , inform design future randomize phase II/III study .</brief_summary>
