	<brief_summary>Carbohydrate store body glycogen , mainly find liver muscle . During endurance exercise , muscle glycogen use fuel work muscle liver glycogen broken provide glucose maintain blood glucose ( sugar ) level . Both liver muscle glycogen important ability perform intense/prolonged endurance exercise . Therefore , important replete store intense/prolonged endurance exercise session order recover perform optimally subsequent exercise bout , especially next exercise session within 24h ( e.g . stage race Tour de France , tournament-style competition Olympic game ultra-endurance event ) . Carbohydrate intake show increase availability glycogen muscle liver exercise . The carbohydrate typically find sport drink glucose sometimes fructose . It observe ingestion glucose lead maximum rate absorption approximately ~1 g/min . However , also provide different source carbohydrate ( fructose ) absorb different pathway therefore absorb ~1.75 g/min carbohydrate . In addition , carbohydrate source metabolise differently human body . By supplement glucose fructose , potentially replenish liver muscle glycogen store faster rate ingestion glucose . Sucrose naturally occur sugar make single glucose single fructose molecule . Therefore , theoretically , use two different pathway absorption also maximise carbohydrate delivery . It yet know however , impact liver muscle glycogen store post-exercise supplement relatively high amount . Therefore aim study ass whether relative high amount sucrose ingestion improve liver muscle glycogen repletion endurance exercise .</brief_summary>
