	<brief_summary>In pharmacotherapy trial drug-dependent population , medication compliance significant issue , rate tend low adherence medication may predict improve outcome ( Baros et al , 2007 ; McRae et al , 2004 ; O'Brien et al , 1996 ; Somoza et al. , 2010 ) .

	<detailed_description>The primary objective clinical trial evaluate acceptability , tolerability , efficacy ID-Cap healthy population . Participation study take 10 visit period approximately five week . The first visit screen visit determine participant eligible participate . After inclusion study , participant randomize one three group . Participants randomize Group 1 compliance measure patient report riboflavin measurement . Participants randomize Group 2 compliance measure patient report , riboflavin measurement , data collect e-Tect reader . Participants randomize Group 3 also compliance measure patient report , riboflavin measurement , data collect e-Tect reader . However , participant randomize group also receive reminder call and/or text message ingest study medication signal send e-Tect reader study team within one hour schedule medication administration time . After initial screen visit , participant present clinic twice weekly complete self-reports compliance , provide urine sample riboflavin assessment , assessed adverse effect . They also ask attend one follow-up visit include abdominal x-ray order confirm passage capsule .</detailed_description>
