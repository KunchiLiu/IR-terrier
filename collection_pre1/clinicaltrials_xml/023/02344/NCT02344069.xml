	<brief_title>Pilot Randomized Trial Fibrinogen Trauma Haemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective To assess efficacy safety immediate pre-emptive first-line treatment fibrinogen concentrate patient trauma haemorrhage need haemostatic resuscitation . Hypothesis Immediate , pre-emptive first-line treatment fibrinogen concentrate trauma patient ongoing critical haemorrhage increase clot strength . Background Trauma haemorrhage remain leading cause morbidity mortality . Fibrinogen essential endogenous component haemostasis plasma level associate bleeding , transfusion outcome . Trial rationale Fibrinogen concentrate widely use correct acquire hypofibrinogenaemia , recommend several international guideline include trauma , evidence lack regard treatment safety efficacy . Trial population The trial population patient ' ≥ 18 year admit Trauma Centre Rigshospitalet immediate need blood transfusion arrival expect need haemostatic resuscitation multiple transfusion initial resuscitation . Estimated 30-day mortality 20 % population . Patients include trial temporarily incompetent acute , severe illness relate ongoing critical bleeding need multiple transfusion immediate intervention control bleed . Trial design This single centre , randomize ( 1:1 , active : placebo ) , placebo control , double-blind investigator-initiated phase II trial patient traumatic , critical bleeding , investigate safety efficacy immediate pre-emptive administration fibrinogen concentrate ( Riastap® ) placebo i.v infusion 40 patient . All patient receive standard care include damage control surgery , radiological intervention haemostatic resuscitation part treatment Rigshospitalet . Patients consider included trial temporarily incompetent acute , critical bleeding relate trauma , scientific guardian co-sign informed consent form . Next-of-kin patient ' general practitioner patient co-sign soon possible . During study blood sample take different time point . Patients observe assess continuously throughout first 72 hour . During extended follow period day 30 , contact make patient follow safety event establish potential mortality . Investigational product Immediate intravenous administration single dose fibrinogen concentrate ( Riastap® , CSL Behring ) , haemostatic resuscitation deem necessary clinician . The aim give intervention &lt; 1 hour arrival , intervention , possible , give prior blood product . Placebo blind Saline 0.9 % use placebo . The volume placebo administer equal volume active drug administer . The content ( Riastap® placebo ) provide opaque syrinx infusion set ( yellow-coloured ) disguise content allocation treatment team . Outcome measure Primary outcome measure : • Thrombelastograph ( TEG® ) Functional Fibrinogen ( FF ) maximum amplitude ( MA ) mm 15 min post intervention Secondary outcome measure : - TEG® FF MA mm 2 , 6 , 24 72 hour post intervention - TEG® MA mm 15 min. , 2 , 6 , 24 72 hour post intervention - Transfusion requirement ( Red blood cell ( RBC ) fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) platelet ( PLT ) ) 2 , 6 , 24 , 72 hour total day 30 - Total use haemostatic therapy ( i.e . use coagulation factor concentrate tranexamic acid ) first 24 72 hour , omit active treatment ( intervention ) - Time intervention placebo - Time FFP PLT transfusion - Percentage patient receive intervention placebo &lt; 1 hour arrival - Time surgical control bleed note surgeon - Severe adverse reaction day 30 , define symptomatic thromboembolism day 30 anaphylaxis day 30 - 24-hour 30-day mortality</detailed_description>
