	<brief_summary>It unclear whether use fluid give `` drip '' beneficial cancer patient last day life , result many individual receive treatment ( although receive fluid mouth , regular mouth care ) . The researcher want undertake large study ( `` main study '' ) determine benefit fluid give drip , first need undertake small study ( `` feasibility study '' ) ensure main study do . The feasibility study do twelve unit ( hospital , hospice ) England &amp; Wales ; unit allocate treatment random , patient unit receive treatment ( appropriate ) . Standard treatment A consist drinking fluid ( possible ) , regular mouth care , treatment symptom ; standard treatment B consist drinking fluid ( possible ) , regular mouth care , fluid drip , treatment symptom . Patients assess four hourly basis , uncontrolled symptom record . The main symptom interest agitation ( `` delirium '' ) , multiple cause , include dehydration kidney failure . Uncontrolled symptom appropriately treat , e.g . patient pain give painkiller . Equally , problem relate fluid give drip also record . Involvement study interfere patient 's general care , additional blood test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CRT Hydration Last Days Life ( Feasibility Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The provision clinically-assisted hydration ( CAH ) end-of-life one contentious issue medicine , indeed within general population . The reason contention include : - lack evidence / CAH ; - disparate opinion healthcare professional CAH ; - generally positive opinion patient carers CAH ( generally negative opinion withhold / withdraw CAH ) . It , therefore , unsurprising provision CAH end-of-life extremely variable within clinical practice ( i.e . 12-88 % cancer patient last week life ) . Hypothesis : CAH last day life reduces frequency hyperactive delirium ( `` terminal agitation '' ) cancer patient result maintenance renal perfusion prevention accumulation toxin drug ( i.e . prevention dehydration ) . Aims / objective : The aim definitive study evaluate utility / role CAH cancer patient last day life . The aim feasibility study answer question `` study ( definitive study ) do '' . The objective feasibility study : - assess recruitment rate , i.e . number eligible patient , number recruit patient , barrier recruitment ; - ass retention rate ; - ass impact trial procedure clinical workload , i.e . completion clinical assessment documentation , undertake mouth care / CAH ; - ass adequacy resource conduct study research centre ; - ass adequacy resource support study Surrey Clinical Research Centre ; - determine challenge researcher / research centre ; - determine challenge Surrey Clinical Research Centre ; - ass safety CAH - determine total variability / intra-cluster correlation coefficient Methodology : The study cluster randomise trial mixed method consent . Consent seek patient ( whenever possible ) , advice `` personal consultee '' ( patient unable provide consent ) , `` nominate consultee '' ( patient unable provide consent , personal consultee ) . Sites randomise either `` standard intervention arm A '' , `` standard intervention arm B '' . Patients standard intervention arm A manage continuance oral intake ( appropriate ) , regular `` mouth care '' . Mouth care perform least every four hour , correspond investigational site 's policy / procedures oral care terminal phase . Patients standard intervention arm B manage continuance oral intake ( appropriate ) , regular `` mouth care '' , CAH , i.e . parenteral fluid . Again , mouth care perform least every four hour , correspond investigational site 's policy / procedures oral care terminal phase . The parenteral fluid may administer either intravenously subcutaneously discretion medical nursing team . The type fluid administer dextrose saline ( i.e . 4 % dextrose , 0.18 % sodium chloride ) , volume administer dependent patient 's weight . The primary endpoint definitive study frequency hyperactive delirium ( `` terminal agitation '' ) , assess use Modified Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ( administer every four hour ) . Other data collect include frequency pain , respiratory secretion / `` death rattle '' , dyspnoea , nausea vomiting , adverse effect CAH , overall survival . In addition , data collect use anti-psychotic drug , sedative drug , analgesic , anti-secretory drug , end-of-life medication . A `` cluster representation mechanism '' ( CRM ) utilise , include appointment site-specific `` study guardian '' `` study gatekeeper '' , protect respect right cluster individual participant within cluster .</detailed_description>
