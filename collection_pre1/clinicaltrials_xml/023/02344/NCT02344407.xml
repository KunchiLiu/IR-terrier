	<detailed_description>Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) West Africa spread rapidly , critical need vaccine prevent EVD . There two candidate Ebola virus vaccine , chimpanzee adenovirus 3 ( ChAd3-EBO Z ) -based vaccine Vesicular Stomatitis virus ( VSVdeltaG-ZEBOV ) -based vaccine . This study evaluate vaccine randomize , double-blind , control , 3-arm study Liberia . Each vaccine compare active control . Because limited data safety vaccine , initial phase ( phase 2 ) study include collection detail data safety define immune response elicit vaccine first 600 volunteer . With decline new case Ebola virus infection phase 3 component longer deem feasible , follow safety , ethical FDA approve/concurrence , study amend robust , 1,500 person phase 2 design . With amendment phasae 3 study endpoint revert phase 2 endpoint safety immunogenicity . Participants age 18 year old enrol health clinic Monrovia , Liberia 4 month . A single dose assign agent administer . Participants phase 2 undergo blood draw assessment adverse event ( AEs ) sign symptom Ebola infection 1 week 1 month vaccination , monthly assessment AEs sign symptom Ebola thereafter . Participants phase 3 undergo monthly assessment AEs sign symptom Ebola infection vaccination . All participant follow 8 12 month . This clinical trial evaluate vaccine efficacy provide accurate assessment benefit risk associated candidate vaccine inform policy wider scale vaccination country .</detailed_description>
