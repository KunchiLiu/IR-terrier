	<brief_summary>Purpose Study Critical illness require life support affect 150 000 people Ontario every year . With aggressive support , number people die critical illness decreasing . However , people survive often neurological problem . These neurological problem often include difficulty memory , concentration , attention . These problem associate poor quality life among survivor critical illness . The aim study identify factor contribute neurological deficit . Specifically , investigator test whether change oxygen delivery brain critical illness relate short- long-term neurological complication . Procedures involve Research When patient diagnose critical illness shock respiratory failure , treat intravenous fluid , medication raise blood pressure , place ventilator assist breathe . They observe intensive care unit ( ICU ) . This research protocol NOT interfere normal treatment patient critical illness . The procedure involve research protocol require placement two sticker either side patient 's forehead , information oxygen delivery brain record . When patient recover critical illness , ask perform several neurological test . Some test do pencil paper , others use robotic device test arm movement , reaction time , concentration . Potential Harms , Risks Discomforts : This research study involve placement sticker sensor either side forehead . Rarely , patient may develop rash electrode . The investigator monitor patient carefully rash , rash occur , sticker sensor remove . With regard neurological testing , rarely patient mild muscle stiffness move arm robot . The investigator expect harm , risk , discomfort .</brief_summary>
