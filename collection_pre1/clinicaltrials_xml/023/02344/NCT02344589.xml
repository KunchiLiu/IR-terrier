	<brief_summary>Our aim investigate component quadriceps femoris muscle affect follow ACB different volume ( 10 , 20 30 ml ) 1 % lignocaine evaluate electromyography . Both placebo treatment ( 20ml saline ) femoral nerve block ( 20ml lignocaine 1 % ) active comparative use model control . Further , want investigate effect volume motor block . This evaluate measure Maximum Voluntary Isometric Contraction ( MVIC ) quadriceps femoris muscle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ACB well-proven analgesic effect TKA , know nerve affect block . Aside motor nerve , nerve vastus medialis quadriceps femoris muscle , contain second large sensory contribution femoral nerve . It probable analgesic effect ACB arise block nerve . Even though ACB mainly sensory nerve block , study healthy volunteer show small decline 8 % quadriceps muscle strength ( 10 ) . It speculate decline muscle strength cause spread local anesthetic nerve supply vastus medialis quadriceps femoris muscle . Three eleven volunteer experience even large decline 25 % quadriceps muscle strength . It argue decline likely cause proximal spread local anesthetic femoral triangle thereby result affection femoral nerve . In study , volume 30 ml local anesthetic use . We know optimal volume ACB find relevant investigate extent part quadriceps muscle get affect different volume local anesthetic inject adductor canal . Selective affection different component femoral quadriceps muscle assess non-invasive EMG recording . Further , quadriceps femoris muscle strength evaluate measure MVIC follow different volume . The EMG recording voluntary ( vEMG ) measure MVIC stimulate ( sEMG ) . sEMG measure transcutaneous electrical stimulation femoral nerve .</detailed_description>
