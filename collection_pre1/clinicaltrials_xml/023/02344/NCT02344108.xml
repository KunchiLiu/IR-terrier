	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) affect 1 % general pediatric population associate adverse behavior quality life , well long term cardiopulmonary system complication . Trisomy 21 ( Down Syndrome ) common chromosomal disorder , incidence approximately 1 per 660-800 birth . Patients Down Syndrome high incidence OSA general pediatric population , rate 30-60 % , result increase morbidity decrease quality life affect individual . In child , adenotonsillectomy ( T &amp; A ) often contribute factor OSA , adenotonsillectomy first line treatment . Children Down Syndrome often undergo T &amp; A obstructive sleep apnea , however 30-50 % persistent obstructive sleep pattern require continuous positive pressure airway support ( CPAP ) tracheotomy . Persistent obstruction attribute anatomic physiologic difference population , include reduce muscular tone , macroglossia , maxillary hypoplasia , lingual tonsil hypertrophy . This pilot study design determine Inspire速 Upper Airway Simulation System , Model 3024 IPG , subsequent iteration thereof approve P130008 treatment obstructive sleep apnea , already approve use adult OSA , safely implant used adolescent young adult Down Syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulator Adolescents With Down Syndrome Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study multi-center , prospective , single-arm study conduct common implant follow-up protocol . Twenty-one adolescent young adult ( 10-21 year age ) Down Syndrome moderate severe obstructive sleep apnea adenotonsillectomy identify Multi-Disciplinary clinic patient Trisomy 21 Massachusetts General Hospital 's Hospital Children , University Hospitals Rainbow Babies Children 's Hospital , Henrietta Egleston Hospital Children , Cincinnati Children 's Hospital , Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh . Patients parent screen senior pulmonologist pediatrician medical clearance willingness participate . Subjects undergo preoperative evaluation in-lab polysomnogram ( PSG ) , evaluation pediatric otolaryngology surgeon , drug induce sleep endoscopy ( DISE ) ensure inclusion exclusion criterion meet . Subjects meet eligibility criterion implant Inspire速 Upper Airway Simulation System , Model 3024 IPG , subsequent iteration thereof approve P130008 treatment obstructive sleep apnea , hypoglossal nerve stimulator , informed consent . Surgery perform senior pediatric otolaryngologist complete train program Inspire速 system . Subjects adhere follow-up schedule . The device activate setting titrate in-lab sleep study 1 month postoperatively . Quality life survey device interrogation conduct timed interval . Subjects undergo in-lab polysomnography 2 month , 6 month , 12-months , annual basis , device titrate need . All personnel adjust device parameter train program Inspire速 system . For pilot study , evaluate safety efficacy first year device implantation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Only child young adult Down Syndrome age 1021 year prior adenotonsillectomy consider study . Subjects must BMI &lt; 95th percentile age All subject must moderate severe OSA ( AHI &gt; 10 , AHI &lt; 50 , 25 % AHI attributable central event ) base prior inlab polysomnography perform adenotonsillectomy . Subjects must either tracheotomy ineffectively treat CPAP due noncompliance , discomfort , undesirable side effect , persistent symptom despite compliance use , refusal use device . Children parent must willing stimulation hardware permanently implant , willing participate followup visit , postoperative polysomnography , questionnaire completion . Children 's parent must complete questionnaire confirm child capable communicating feeling pain discomfort . They must also confirm able ass child adverse effect related device implantation . Children parent must proficient English pilot study order ensure full disclosure consent process , well ability communicate staff , time , regard question participation concern device . In order participate , subject require write consent parent . All study subject must provide write assent well . Subjects exclude meet follow criterion : BMI &gt; 95th percentile age , apnea hypopnea index ( AHI ) &lt; 10 &gt; 50 inlab polysomnography ( PSG ) , central mixed apnea account &gt; 25 % total AHI , anatomic find physical exam drug induce sleep endoscopy ( DISE ) would compromise performance stimulation ( e.g . concentric soft palate collapse ) , medical condition result medical instability ( e.g . congestive heart failure , recent open heart surgery , immunosuppression , chronic lung disease aspiration ) , presence another medical condition require future magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , history cholesteatoma , patient another implantable device could interact unintentionally Inspire system . Subjects general anesthesia surgical procedure contraindicate due medical illness condition exclude . Subjects life expectancy &lt; 12 month exclude . Subjects unable communicate pain discomfort caretaker/parent , base parental investigator assessment , exclude . Subjects history bleed clot disorder blood thin NSAID medication exclude participation . Subjects take muscle relaxant medication exclude participation . Female subject pregnant plan become pregnant study period exclude . All female subject undergo urine betaHCG test day procedure require general anesthesia ( DISE , implantation , unanticipated surgical procedure relate implantation ) . Subjects positive undergo surgical implantation procedure general anesthesia . Subjects deem unfit participation investigator reason exclude .</criteria>
