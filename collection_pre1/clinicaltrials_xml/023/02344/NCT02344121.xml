	<brief_title>Intra- Inter-fraction Changes Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The accurate detail knowledge change ( e.g. , anatomically/biologically intra- inter-fraction change ) obtain study would allow research team determine Adaptive Radiation Therapy ( ART ) perform give tumor site/type . Radiation oncologist choose proper ART strategy give tumor type account anatomic/biological intra- inter-fraction change , improve accuracy radiation therapy delivery , turn reduce treatment related toxicity and/or improve tumor local control .</detailed_description>
