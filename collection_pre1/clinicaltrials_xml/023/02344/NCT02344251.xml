	<brief_title>Assessing Effectiveness Safety ID-Cap System Medication Monitoring Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective clinical trial evaluate acceptability , tolerability , efficacy ID-Cap-M healthy population . The ID-Cap ingestible medical device detect presence ingest capsule inside gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract . Participation study take 3 visit period approximately six week . The first visit screen visit determine participant eligible participate . After initial assessment visit , participant randomize one two group . Group 1 compliance measure self-report urine riboflavin level . This group receive computer-chipped capsule , receive medication bottle cap MEMS Track Cap , record medication bottle open closed . Group 2 receive computer-chipped capsule compliance measure self-report , urine riboflavin level , data collect e-Tect reader . Participants randomize group also receive reminder call and/or text message ingest study medication signal send e-Tect reader study team within one hour schedule medication administration time . They also use biometric identification technology ensure take capsule direct , specifically electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . After initial screen visit , participant require attend two clinic visit six-week study , randomization visit one-week follow-up visit approximately one week last medication dose .</detailed_description>
