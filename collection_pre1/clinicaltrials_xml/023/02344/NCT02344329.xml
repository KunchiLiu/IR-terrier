	<brief_title>A Comparison TCC-EZ Using Human Amnion Allograft v TCC-EZ Standard Wound Care Treating Diabetic Foot Ulcers .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A TCC offload pressure gold standard DFU treatment , document several study . The TCC result average healing rate 80-90 % within 6 week , yet 6 % DFU patient receive TCC . The TCC require special provider training application . Given high efficacy low complication risk TCC , clinician need use TCC treat DFUs . Literature support use TCC combine wound bed treatment modality . AmnioExCel® dehydrate , extracellular human amnion derive tissue allograft provide structural tissue matrix promote angiogenesis , collagen matrix formation re-epithelization ( Werber et al. , 2013 ) . This study look whether combine AmnioExCel® TCC-EZ result well heal rate TCC-EZ standard wound care . Purpose/Research Questions : The purpose prospective clinical trial compare heal rate two treatment modality patient DFUs ambulatory wound care clinic . The treatment Total Contact Casting ( TCC-EZ ) AmnioExCel® TCC-EZ standard treatment . Research Questions : 1 . What difference reduction wound bed area diabetic foot ulcer ( DFUs ) treat Total Contact Casting TCC-EZ AmnioExCel® compare treat TCC-EZ standard wound treatment ? 2 . What difference time closure DFUs treat TCC-EZ AmnioExCel® compare treat TCC-EZ standard wound treatment ? 3 . What difference cost treatment diabetic foot ulcer treat TCC-EZ AmnioExCel® compare TCC-EZ standard wound treatment ? 4 . What relationship hemoglobin A1c test ( HbA1c ) glycated hemoglobin test reduction wound bed area DFUs treat TCC-EZ AmnioExCel® compare treat TCC-EZ standard wound treatment ? 5 . What relationship HbA1c time closure DFUs TCC-EZ AmnioExCel® compare treat TCC-EZ standard wound treatment ? 6 . What subject ' reported satisfaction use TCC-EZ ? 7 . What reoccurrence DFUs 90 day post treatment follow ? 8 . What characteristics adverse side effect use TCC-EZ AmnioExCel® ? Methods : All patient study receive 2 week usual wound care consist wound cleansing , removal pressure ( offload ) , sharp debridement need , maintenance moist wound environment . If demonstrate less 50 % improvement reduction wound area DFU 2 week , subject approach participation study . If agree participate , randomly assign one two treatment group . Treatment Group A consist TCC-EZ® AmnioExCel® treatment Group B consist standard wound care TCC-EZ® standard wound care . If subject one ulcer large ulcer use inclusion study . At begin end study blood sample HbA1c take HbA1c great 15 % , subject exclude random blood sugar great 450 mg/dl ( Marston et al. , 2003 ) . Study participation 12 week less wound close 12 week . DFUs close end 12 week study continue treat close base decision Altru Wound Care Clinic provider . Complete wound closure define 100 % re-epithelization without drainage infection . Subjects clinic charts/records review researcher collect follow data : group assign , gender , age , diabetes diagnosis , co-morbidities , time ulcer present , conventional treatment occur two week , date 1st wound clinic visit , last HbA1c , date ulcer 1st noticed patient , depth , size ulcer , ankle-brachial index , ulcer characteristic visit also document . At conclusion study , subject complete 12 question satisfaction questionnaire six demographic question TCC-EZ administer clinic nurse provider . Subjects may elect withdraw study time without repercussion .</detailed_description>
