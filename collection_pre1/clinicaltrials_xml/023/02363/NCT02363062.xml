	<brief_summary>The major objective project map/identify new loci/genes , combination whole exome sequence genome-wide linkage autosomal dominant FTLD family exclude known mutation . Several secondary goal attain course project : For novel gene identify project , determine spectrum mutation , evaluate frequency characterize associate phenotype . This allow u establish genotype-phenotype correlation large number family , improve nosology disorder diagnostic procedure ;</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification New FTLD Genes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background justification research . In France , 6,000 8,000 patient affected frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( FTLD ) . FTLD degenerative dementia relate Alzheimer 's disease , characterized behavioural , language cognitive disorder begin sixth decade . The genetic form FTLD frequent ( 30-50 % patient ) , gene responsible 30-40 % familial FTLD still unknown . At present , molecular diagnosis propose 30 % FTLD family patient , responsible gene still unknown . No presymptomatic testing propose either at-risk relative family . Objectives . 1 . The principal objective proposal identify one several gene responsible FTLD . 2 . The secondary objective : - evaluate relative frequency identify gene ; - describe phenotype associate mutation gene ; - establish phenotype-genotype correlation order improve diagnostic procedure strategy ; - develop new genetic diagnostic analysis near future . Project The patient recruit three hospital ( Paris Salpetriere , Limoges , Lille ) . These three center partner national clinico-genetic network 20 french center expert FTLD/FTLD-ALS , coordinate Dr . I Le Ber . The participant network collaborate last 15 year , already recruit 1,000 patient FTLD . Sequencing know gene family allow identification 150 family autosomal dominant form FTLD associate know mutation . Through network , aim recruit 400 new patient FTLD 4 year project . This estimation base annual recruitment network last two year . In project , 30 informative family extend ( 440 patient relative sample ) . The combination whole exome sequence genetic linkage study FTLD family without known mutation , large number family include project , two major point lead identification several new gene . When causative gene identify , establish frequency mutation , extend mutational spectrum , describe clinical phenotype establish phenotype-genotype correlation . Genetic parameter penetrance analyze .</detailed_description>
