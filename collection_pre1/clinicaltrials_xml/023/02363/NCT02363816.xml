	<brief_summary>Weight gain , hypertension , high cholesterol sugar abnormality childhood strongly link predict risk complication early death adulthood . The new antipsychotic , call second generation antipsychotic commonly use treat mood disorder adult pediatric population . Their use substantially increase ( 5-fold ) past 15 year child due approve use Food Drug Administration high acceptance general medical community . However , second generation antipsychotic know damaging side effect cause child gain substantial amount weight , high cholesterol , high blood pressure high sugar level . Despite known risk use still need may contribute high rate obesity-related disease childhood ultimately short life-spans adulthood . How second generation antipsychotic cause side effect still well know . Preliminary evidence identify novel pathway may associate second generation antipsychotic side effect . This pathway study , involve vitamin A metabolism call beta-carotene pathway . Beta-carotene important part diet act anti-oxidant ( fight harmful oxidative stress body ) produce active form vitamin A essential several process body . The investigator 's work identify backup pathway investigator hypothesize due genetic variation enzyme find within pathway . The investigator hypothesize genetic variation beta-carotene pathway responsible side effect associate second generation antipsychotic . The investigator want complete cross-sectional , pilot study pediatric population use future prospective , extramural application . The investigator propose two aim study : Aim 1 : Determine second generation antipsychotic change beta-carotene metabolism . For aim , investigator hypothesize high beta-carotene : retinoic acid ratio due genetic varition beta-carotene pathway . Aim 2 : Define relationship beta-carotene metabolism , oxidative stress second generation antipsychotic induced insulin resistance . For aim investigator hypothesize low beta-carotene level associate high oxidative stress level insulin resistance .</brief_summary>
