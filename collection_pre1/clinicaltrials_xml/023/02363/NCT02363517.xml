	<brief_title>The TAP Study : Treating People Who Inject Drugs Community-Based Settings Using Social Network Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigate feasibility treat people inject drug ( PWID ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) community-based setting 12-week course oral therapy combination sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir ( SOF + LDP ) . It also measure effectiveness use social network-based approach ( `` bring friend '' ) reduce HCV incidence among PWID . Participants initially source Burnet Institute 's exist SuperMIX cohort ( N= 757 ) . This cohort comprise PWID follow two six year ( median=1057 day ) , 299 chronic HCV infection . The HCV genotype distribution SuperMIX cohort : HCV-1 ( 55 % ) ; HCV-3 ( 40 % ) HCV-6 ( &lt; 5 % ) . Participants randomly allocate three group : Group 1 : Primary ( n=40 ) secondary ( n=100 ) participant receive supportive care . Group 2 : Primary participant ( n=40 ) treat SOF + LDP 12 week . Secondary participant ( n=100 ) receive supportive care . Group 3 : Primary ( n=40 ) secondary participant chronic HCV infection ( n=50 % *100 ) treat SOF + LDP 12 week . Participants Group C evidence HCV re-infection offer re-treatment SOF + LDP 12 week . Treatment participant clinical review , questionnaire blood sample collect baseline , week 4 , 8 12 ( end-of-treatment ) , week 12 ( SVR12 ) , 24 ( SVR24 ) , 36 , 48 , 60 72 post-treatment . Non-treatment participant clinical review , questionnaire blood sample collect baseline week 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 72 84 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>SECONDARY PARTICIPANTS INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA Study INCLUSION criterion primary participant follow : Current PWID ( i.e. , inject drug least previous six month ) ; Evidence chronic HCV infection ( detectable plasma HCV RNA viral load 1000 IU/ml two occasion ≥ 6 month apart ) Willing able provide write informed consent . Subjects must follow laboratory parameter screen : ALT &lt; 10 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST &lt; 10 time ULN Haemoglobin ≥12g/dL male , ≥11g/dL female subject INR ≤1.5 time ULN unless stable anticoagulant regimen affect INR Albumin ≥3g/dL Direct bilirubin ≤1.5 time ULN Creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) ≥60mL/min , calculate CockcroftGault Equation . EXCLUSION criterion primary participant follow : Testing positive HIV History , current , decompensated liver disease Testing positive HBsAg HCC Women pregnant breastfeeding , men female partner pregnant screen baseline , pregnant six month prior screen Already enrol TAP Study secondary participant ( see ) Evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality circumstance ( current prior ) may confound study 's result , interfere participation full duration study , best interest participant ; Use concomitant medication . Additional EXCLUSION criterion primary participant HCV genotypes 26 : Increased baseline risk anaemia ( e.g. , history thalassemia , spherocytosis , history GI bleeding ) , anaemia would medically problematic ; Documented presume coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease , judgment investigator , acute decrease haemoglobin 4g/dL ( may see ribavirin therapy ) would welltolerated . SECONDARY PARTICIPANTS INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA The INCLUSION criterion secondary participant follow : Is nominated primary participant current injecting partner ( i.e. , engage IDU primary participant previous six month ) Willing able provide write informed consent . There exclusion criterion secondary participant receive HCV therapy protocol : EXCLUSION criterion treat secondary participant ( i.e. , Group C HCV positive ) follow : History , current , decompensated liver disease Women pregnant breastfeeding , men female partner pregnant screen baseline , pregnant six month prior screen Testing positive HIV Testing positive HBsAg HCC Evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality circumstance ( current prior ) may confound study 's result , interfere participation full duration study , best interest participant Use concomitant medication . Additional EXCLUSION criterion secondary participant HCV genotypes 26 : Increased baseline risk anaemia ( e.g . history thalassemia , spherocytosis , history GI bleeding ) anaemia would medically problematic Documented presume coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease , judgment investigator , acute decrease haemoglobin 4g/dL ( may see ribavirin therapy ) would welltolerated .</criteria>
