	<brief_summary>This study examine effect individualize diet exercise plan muscle strength , quality life respiratory function Pompe disease . Subjects give diet exercise plan base individual need , follow 16 week . Participants also provide activity tracker , FitBit Apple Watch , order track diet exercise activity , also come University Florida exercise test , respiratory test questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diet Exercise Pompe Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pompe rare disease , occur approximately 1 40,000 birth . It progressive often fatal neuromuscular disorder result mutation gene acid alpha- glucosidase ( GAA ) , enzyme necessary degradation glycogen . Common symptom include skeletal smooth muscle myopathy , result respiratory insufficiency , peripheral muscle weakness generalize fatigue . The progressive myopathy Pompe disease seem influence increased muscle protein breakdown . The increased muscle protein breakdown lead muscle wasting , weakness , increase rest energy expenditure , consequently , increase fatigue . Our hypothesis high protein , low carbohydrate diet associate regular physical exercise improve respiratory peripheral muscle function Pompe disease . In study , investigate effect 16 week plan diet exercise adolescent young adult ( 15-60 year old ) individual Pompe disease use activity tracker .</detailed_description>
