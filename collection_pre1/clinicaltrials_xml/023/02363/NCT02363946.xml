	<brief_title>A Study ARC-AAT Healthy Volunteer Subjects Patients With Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency ( AATD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , single-dose-escalation first-in-human , Phase 1 study . Healthy volunteer AATD patient randomize receive single intravenous injection either ARC-AAT Placebo double-blind fashion . Up thirteen cohort ( 6 participant per cohort ) enrol . Subjects cohort confine clinical facility begin Day -1 discharge Day 2 . Escalation next dose level proceed participant experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) achievement pre-determined threshold reduction AAT level . Dosing AATD patient commence base pre-determined threshold reduction AAT level healthy volunteer . Participants undergo follow evaluation regular interval : medical history , physical examination , bee venom allergy blood test , vital sign measurement , weight , adverse event monitoring , ECGs , pregnancy test ( female ) , concurrent medication , pulmonary function test sample collection hematology , coagulation , chemistry , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , complement , cytokine , drug screen , serum alpha-1antitrypsin level , urinalysis . For participant , duration study clinic visit 11 week , Screening End-of-Study examination . However , include Day 90 Follow-Up telephone call , maximum study duration approximately 20 week .</detailed_description>
