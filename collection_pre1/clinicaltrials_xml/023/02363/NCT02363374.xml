	<brief_summary>Preoperative 5-FU-based ( 5-fluorouracil ) chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) , total mesorectal excision surgery , 4 cycle adjuvant 5-FU - establish CAO/ARO/AIO-94 - present standard care patient locally advanced rectal cancer ( UICC stage II III ) . The phase III German CAO/ARO/AIO-04 trial show , addition oxaliplatin increase treatment efficacy term early secondary efficacy endpoint ( e.g . pCR-rate ) . With median follow-up 50 month , primary endpoint trial - disease free survival - significantly improve oxaliplatin-containing treatment arm ( 3-year disease-free survival ( DFS ) 71.2 % versus 75.9 % , hazard ratio ( HR ) 0.79 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.64-0.98 , p=0.03 ) . The hereby propose randomized phase II trial CAO/ARO/AIO-12 aim find novel innovative aspect rectal cancer treatment , thus provide important information define experimental arm upcoming large scale trial group . Compared current standard , study arm , sequence three treatment modality modify , place chemotherapy block surgery . The pre-operative sequence chemotherapy - &gt; chemoradiotherapy ( arm A ) show feasible early tumor progression prior definitive surgical resection small randomize phase II study Spain . The sequence chemoradiotherapy - &gt; chemotherapy ( arm B ) may beneficial accord response kinetics consideration , maintain highly effective local treatment first place . Both approach could avoid problem major compliance problem post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy . CAO/ARO/AIO : German Rectal Cancer Study Group</brief_summary>
