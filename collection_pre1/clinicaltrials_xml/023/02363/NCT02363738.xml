	<brief_summary>Studies show presence immuno-inflammatory disturbance individual Bipolar Disorders ( BD ) . Increased level circulate protein know cytokine promote inflammation consistently report individual bipolar disorder . A particular cytokine refer Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) -alpha among cytokine consistently identify across depressive , manic , euthymic period . Disturbances inflammation however , see individual bipolar disorder . Those individual sign inflammation also often present high prevalence medical disorder also associate inflammation . Those individual significant sign inflammation may respond anti-inflammatory treatment . In study , individual bipolar depression exhibit sign high inflammation enrol treat either anti-inflammatory biologic know infliximab placebo ( saline ) .</brief_summary>
