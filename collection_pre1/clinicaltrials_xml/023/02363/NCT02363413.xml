	<brief_title>Initiation Non- Invasive Ventilation Home Versus Hospital Among Patients With Overlap Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Overlap Syndrome define coexistence chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) apnea - hypopnea syndrome obstructive sleep ( SAHS ) . The interaction two disease responsible deep nocturnal desaturation , decrease sensitivity CO2 , pronounce sleep alteration , frequent daytime hypercapnia , high risk hypertension pulmonary increase cardiovascular risk , compare subject COPD isolate SAHS . The Overlap Syndrome treatment continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) , associate complement oxygen therapy sleep . The criterion choose type treatment well define . Quality compliance NIV important disease lead chronic respiratory failure whose Overlap Syndrome . The increase number patient treat NIV estimate 12 % per year . The NIV startup usually perform conventional hospitalization congestion healthcare pathways lead increase wait time treatment . Thus , date , study validate supported alternative meet increase number patient NIV maintain quality service . The HAS define good candidate NIV home base startup , follow criterion : patient recognize indication NIV long term , stable respiratory failure , require nocturnal ventilation , surround caregiver master use equipment whose location allow rapid intervention . The study base assumption Overlap Syndrome , introduction home NIV effective term compliance clinical gazometric improvement , life quality , set hospital start . The investigator study initiation NIV home versus hospital two randomized Overlap Syndrome patient group . The main objective study demonstrate non-inferiority initiation NIV home versus hospital term compliance .</detailed_description>
