	<brief_summary>Accumulating evidence suggest proliferative , invasive , immune tolerance mechanism malignant tumor use establish nutrient supply evade edit host immune response similar use develop placenta normal pregnancy . In addition share capacity invade normal tissue , cancer cell cell develop placenta create microenvironment supportive immunologic privilege angiogenesis . CD11b+Gr1+ cell heterogeneous population bone marrow-derived cell ( BMDC ) consist immature myeloid cell ( IMCs ) , first describe myeloid-derived suppressor cell . In healthy individual , IMCs generate bone marrow differentiate mature granulocyte , macrophage , dendritic cell ( DCs ) . These cell show play essential role mediate immune suppression animal model human tumor . As result tumor-induced alteration myelopoiesis , IMCs find peripheral blood , lymphoid organ tumor tissue . An increased population IMCs identify patient several tumor type . Accordingly , IMCs detect peripheral blood patient bear express common myeloid marker CD33 lack marker mature myeloid cell MHC class II molecule HLADR . IMCs show actively promote tumor growth metastasis modulate cytokine environment , vascular remodel promote angiogenesis . It demonstrate laboratory IMCs infiltrate placenta pregnant mouse actively promote angiogenesis . These cell show striking similarity IMCs populate malignant tumor . Accordingly , human placenta also infiltrate significant population IMCs . Immunostaining human placenta show IMCs comprise around 25 % ( range 10-40 % ) total placental CD45+ bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cell population locate close blood capillary . We also demonstrate immature DCs , cell originally describe regulate adaptive immune response , also promote angiogenesis model choroidal neovascularization , endometriosis tumor . This retrospective study patient 's blood sample pregnant woman come delivery department 1.1.2014-31.12.2014 , compare abundance monocytes neutrophil : 1 . Term active labor . 2 . Elective cesarean section . According previous finding , hypothesize monocyte active delivery low woman without sign labor . We also hypothesize neutrophil abundant active delivery woman without sign labor . We plan screen anonymous electronic data woman deliver departement 2014 accord follow eligible criterion , stratify 2 category : 1 . Women admit active labor . 2 . Women admit elective Cesarean Section without sign labor . We compare abundance monocyte neutrophil blood count take admission day two population .</brief_summary>
