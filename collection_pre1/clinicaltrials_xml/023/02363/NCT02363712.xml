	<brief_summary>Painful knee osteoarthritis common treatment , short knee replacement , limit . The investigator plan test efficacy novel promising device treatment knee osteoarthritis affect inner part knee , common location . There disease modifying treatment available therefore emphasis conservative management technique benefit individual . Many treatment ( insole , brace , physiotherapy etc ) show relative success individual new novel device demonstrate good effectiveness patient group . APOS ( All Phases Step ) therapy consist shoe orient system care work shift load across part knee retrain low extremity muscle . Preliminary data suggest impressive favourable reduction knee pain commensurate decrease knee load walking . However , APOS treatment never evaluate randomise control trial even though widely use among Bupa member part world . In addition , study fully investigate mechanism treatment aid knee pain , whether primarily biomechanical ( mechanic movement ) alteration , muscle strength control change , combination two . The investigator propose conduct randomise blind control trial APOS treatment among person painful knee osteoarthritis affect inside ( medial lateral ) knee . The investigator focus pain outcome quality life well understand APOS treatment work , investigator also obtain data load across knee gait laboratory , along measure strength function . In addition standard pain scale , change knee structure treatment use MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) analyse determine whether bone marrow lesion ( bone bruise ) reduce strongly link pain individual medial lateral knee osteoarthritis , related load medial lateral knee . APOS commit provide shoe system match sham device , develop , also provide technician trained calibrate pertupods ( ball sole foot ) shoe without charge . The research undertaken University set gait evaluation strong link Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility Manchester MRI image . Running randomise control trial labour time intensive therefore team assemble vast experience carry randomise controlled trial treatment knee osteoarthritis , experience ethical requirement , recruitment evaluation . The cost request reflect nature research large proportion staff cost also non-staff cost MRI image non-staff cost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>APOS Therapy Osteoarthritis Knee : Randomized Controlled Trial BIOTOK</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common arthritic condition one leading cause disability adult Switzerland worldwide ( CDC 2009 , WHO 2004 ) . With steady escalation world life expectancy constant decline world birth rate , incidence prevalence OA expect rise continuously worldwide throughout year come ( Badley 1998 ) . In Switzerland , OA associate decrease quality life frequent use health care system ( Rosemann 2008 ) . Currently , treatment stop reverse progressive joint degeneration cause OA . Most clinical intervention aim improve pain disability main symptom afflict OA patient ( Grotle 2008 ) , manage pain associate OA knee difficult . Existing non-pharmacological pharmacological intervention OA remain insufficient . There effective nonsurgical treatment painful knee OA ( JÃ¼ni 2006 ) . OA affect different compartment knee , biomechanical factor play important role . Observational study suggest approximately 60 % affected person medial joint involvement ( Niu 2009 ) , subject excessive loading quantified adduction moment across knee . Bone marrow lesion ( BMLs ) see knee person painful knee OA fat suppress MRI image . In MOST cohort study , 80 % person medial knee OA knee pain medial BMLs . On histology , BMLs represent area bone damage micro-cracks remodelling . They strongly relate malalignment knee varus alignment high risk BMLs medial compartment valgus alignment risk lateral BMLs ( Felson 2003 ) . Wedges orthotics realign knee test several randomized trial . This literature undergone Cochrane review orthoses treat knee OA ( Brower 2005 ) note conclusion , 'wearing laterally wedge orthosis compare wear neutral wedge may lead difference pain , knee function , overall well-being ' . None trial test orthotics insert show significant effect compare control term knee pain reduction . The notable finding almost trial reduce varus moment across knee , 6 % average . One possible reason insert orthotics work reduce pain large enough realign effect knee ( assessed varus moment ) . APOS therapy , new popular medical device , shoe system demonstrate potentially improve effectiveness patient suffer OA . This footwear two potential mechanism action : 1. alter pattern knee loading , report reduction varus moment 17 % ( Elbaz 2010 ) , 2. retrains low extremity motor control . Forcing people avoid walk usual wide plantar surface instead walk two rubber ball ( APOS shoe ) half hour start study , increase successively ( +10 min/week ) almost 5 hours/day 24 week ( exactly accord scheme physiotherapist 's discretion ) , force muscular retrain therefore serve built-in exercise intervention . The investigator therefore aim compare efficacy safety APOS therapy large , pragmatic randomize controlled trial include gait analysis understand mechanistic action device . Objective Overall objective : The purpose trial evaluate whether APOS therapy improve symptom compare Sham APOS therapy participant symptomatic knee OA . Primary objective : The trial determine effect APOS therapy pain compare Sham APOS therapy 24 week . Secondary objective : Secondary objective determine - The effect APOS therapy pain compare Sham APOS therapy 4 , 8 , 12 16 week - The effect APOS therapy joint stiffness , disability overall assessment disease compare Sham APOS therapy 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 week - The effect APOS therapy quality life 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 week - The effect APOS therapy gait analysis measurement baseline , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 24 week - The effect APOS therapy rescue analgesic compare Sham APOS therapy throughout study duration ( 24 week ) 24 week - The time spent average shoe Methods This trial patient-blind , single-centre , two-arm , parallel-group , 24 week ( 6 month ) randomize control trial compare APOS therapy Sham APOS therapy . While patient physician blind regard intervention , technician applying shoe . The trial conduct among person painful knee osteoarthritis . 220 patient randomly assign 1:1 basis one two treatment , APOS therapy Sham APOS therapy . Randomisation stratify accord lateral / medial unilateral / bilateral knee OA status .</detailed_description>
