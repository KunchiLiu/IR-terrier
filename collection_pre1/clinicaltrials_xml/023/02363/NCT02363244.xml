	<brief_summary>This pilot study ass cell adequacy quality Pap smear adequacy sample HPV DNA virus test do application 5 % acetic acid VIA test.Normally Pap test HPV DNA test perform application acetic acid . It assume application acetic acid may alter cell adequacy Pap test HPV DNA test , test do immediately VIA test.The present study aim see effect 4-5 % acetic acid [ vinegar ] cell adequacy quality Pap smear sample adequacy HPV DNA test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim ( pilot study ) : To evaluate cell adequacy smear quality Pap smear adequacy sample HPV HC 2 collect application acetic acid . Objective Pilot study- 1 . Agreement result HC2 cervical sample obtain woman 5 10 min VIA test 2 . Correlation RLU/ cutoff ratio HC2 cervical sample obtain woman 5 10 min VIA test . 3 . Agreement result cytology cervical smear obtain immediately 5 10 min VIA test woman . Methodology : Design : Pilot study Study Duration : Three month Study Site : Preventive Oncology screen clinic , Tata Memorial Hospital Sample Size calculation power estimate : For pilot study , sample method convenience sample 50 consecutive eligible woman attend Preventive Oncology screen clinic consent participate study . These woman randomly allocate use lottery method ( wherein 25 chit HPV 25 chit cytology write inside place ) . For every participant woman chit pick woman allot either HPV cytology test depend message chit . Thereafter chit discard . In 25 sample Pap smear collect application acetic acid . Steps mention . In rest 25 sample HPV DNA collect application acetic acid . Steps mention . Step 1 : A per speculum examination perform eligible woman attend Preventive Oncology screen clinic finding record . Step 2 : Pap smear collect - Smear 1 . OR Cervical cell sample collect HPV HC II - HPV sample 1 . Step 3 : VIA perform finding note . Step 4 : A second Pap smear collect 5 10 minute perform VIA woman still examination table provider- Smear 2 . OR Cervical cell sample collect HPV HC II - HPV sample 2 . Step 5 : The smear submit cytology department evaluation . The HPV HC II sample submit Microbiology department evaluation . Step 6 : The cytologist read smear blind smear take take application acetic acid . The cytologist read pre-VIA post-VIA smear . Similarly , Microbiology department staff blind HPV sample take take application acetic acid . The paired sample analyze laboratory batch test . Step 7 : The screen negative woman undergo routine follow-up . The screen positive woman undergo Colposcopy , guide biopsy management accord Tata Memorial Hospital protocol . Analysis variable Data entry do Department Preventive Oncology , Tata Memorial Hospital use SPSS version 18 . Checks consistency , data safety analysis carry regular interval . Both descriptive inferential statistic generate describe variable study objective . Agreement HC2 result pre-VIA post-VIA sample estimate use kappa statistic . Similarly , agreement pap result pre-VIA post-VIA sample estimate use kappa statistic . Sensitivity specificity HC2 test pap test detect CIN2+ lesion calculate use negative colposcopy biopsy gold standard compare pre post VIA sample .</detailed_description>
