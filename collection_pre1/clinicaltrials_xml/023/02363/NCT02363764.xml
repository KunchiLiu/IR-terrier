	<brief_summary>Accurate identification lower respiratory tract pathogens standard care management CF patient therefore recommend perform regular bacterial culture , least year , even recommend monthly culture . This do different method , sputum bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) gold standard . However , BAL invasive method , designate repeat monthly . Therefore , diagnosis lower respiratory tract infection challenge non-expectorating CF patient . Other method , induce sputum ( IS ) , cough swab nasal swab , develop obtain bacterial culture patient . Studies investigated reliability different sample method , however , controversial conclusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Challenge Obtaining Qualitative Bacterial Cultures Non-expectorating Cystic Fibrosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>I. Protocol design : The current protocol design compare : - Group 1 : nasal swab , cough swab spontaneous expectorate sputum expectorate CF patient - Group 2 : nasal swab , cough swab induce sputum non-expectorating CF patient - Group 3 : nasal swab , cough swab , induce sputum BAL expectorate non-expectorating CF patient require clinically indicate bronchoscopy II . Flow chart : 1 . Nasal swab obtain physiotherapyst ( PT ) 2 . Patient rinse mouth water , follow autogenic drainage 3 . Cough swab obtain PT 4 . Obtainment 3rd ( 4th ) sample : - Group 1 : Sputum sample voluntary expectorate patient - Group 2 3 : Induced sputum sample -- &gt; voluntary cough expectorated patient inhalation 4ml HS OR - Group 3 : BAL -- &gt; obtain pulmonologist bronchoscopy 5 . Filling questionnaire acceptability different sample method patient &gt; 6 year age ( Group 3 ) III . Analysis sample : ( Induced ) Sputum sample , cough nasal swab aseptically collect appropriate disposable immediately send Laboratory Microbiology Infection Control Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel , analyse carry within 24h post-sampling . These analysis include : - Culture identification respiratory pathogen selective non-selective medium - Each type colony identify MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry , complete identification test need - When appropriate , susceptibility test perform isolated bacteria IV . Statistical analysis : - Determination sensitivity , specificity , positive predict value , negative predict value different sample method - Preference one method another : crosstabs , Chi-square test - Pain experienced method ( Yes/No ) : Student 's t-test - VAS-scale pain per method : ANOVA</detailed_description>
