	<detailed_description>Diabetic peripheral neuropathy [ DPN ] cause diabetes-related metabolic damage sensory nervous system . It affect 3 million Americans leading cause nerve damage-associated pain worldwide . Currently approve drug gabapentin , pregabalin , duloxetine provide pain relief 1 4 5 people DPN , point great need identify effective therapy patient . Recent literature suggest certain method assess sensory nerve function neuropathic pain patient may provide prediction individual analgesic response ; however , placebo-controlled study perform primary goal identify treatment response predictor DPN . We propose study examine whether sensory test determine mechanical pain threshold [ MPT ] heat pain threshold [ HPT ] predict subject 's response IV lidocaine analgesic therapy . We hypothesize people painful DPN high MPT HPT likely respond lidocaine treatment . This prospective , double blind , placebo-controlled study primary objective determine whether result sensory test predict response systemic lidocaine patient painful DPN . Consented subject attend screen visit two intervention visit , undergo sensory test receive intravenous lidocaine placebo infusion cross-over design . At enrollment , patient assign study number , match previously prepared computer-generated list randomization number determine sequence intervention : lidocaine placebo , vice versa . An unblinded research nurse coordinator assign match study number randomize treatment sequence , person prepare study medication , look identical . This research nurse coordinator involve stage patient assessment data analysis . The participant study personnel blind treatment allocation .</detailed_description>
