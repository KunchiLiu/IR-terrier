	<brief_summary>Study Phase : multi-institutional Phase II study Primary Objective ( ) : To determine overall survival HCC patient treat CyberKnife SBRT 2 year . Secondary Objective ( ) : 1 ) To determine overall survival HCC patient treat CyberKnife SBRT 1 year 2 ) To determine local control use RECIST EASL criteria 1 2 year 3 ) To assess progression-free survival 1 2 year 4 ) To assess acute late toxicity follow CyberKnife SBRT . Hypothesis : Overall survival rate HCC patient one year SBRT treatment le 65 % . Study Design : Single arm study . Patients undergo CT scan without contrast MRI scan radiation treatment plan target delineation.SBRT deliver CyberKnife Synchrony Respiratory Tracking capability . The tumor track 3 implanted fiducial seed target . Treatment deliver 3 fraction within 7 day window discretion investigator . Sample size : The sample size require 93 power 90 % , p=0.05 , 50 % response rate consider effective ( p0 ) 65 % overall survival rate 1 year ( p1 ) consider effectiveness treatment . The estimated drop-out rate 20 % , total sample size would 117 . Statistical Considerations : The set Intention-To-Treat ( ITT ) analyze . All patient censor last visit , include patient lose follow-up . All patient follow counted therapy assign , even decline therapy . Only patient refuse ( write ) outcomes count study 's conclusion include analysis time forward ; however , follow-up data patient include time withdraw consent . Such patient replace . Baseline characteristic patient present summary statistic . Time-to-event survival rate OS DFS estimate use Kaplan-Meier method present one and/or two year . The incidence acute late toxicity present tabular form per-patient per-event basis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Effectiveness Safety Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Treated With CyberKnife</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Indication : Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) third deadly cancer world . It primarily see area hepatitis endemic , Asia , risk factor include alcoholic cirrhosis . Surgical resection and/or transplantation remain curative option . However , 80 % patient present unresectable disease . For patient unresectable tumor , variety treatment option available , include transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) , radioactive microspheres , microwave coagulation , laser-induced thermotherapy , percutaneous alcohol injection , similar survival rate . Stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) unresectable HCC relatively new treatment option make available significant improvement diagnostic image radiation delivery technique . Although follow-up limited , result show encouraging local control rate . The investigator propose conduct Phase II study assess efficacy safety CyberKnife SBRT treatment HCC . Summary Subject Eligibility Criteria : Inclusion Criteria 1 . Confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma accord one three EASL criterion : - Histopathology - Two radiographic technique ( US , MRI , CT , Angiography ) confirm lesion &gt; 2 cm arterial hypervascularization - One radiographic technique confirm lesion &gt; 2 cm arterial hypervascularization AFP &gt; 400 ng/mL 2 . Unifocal liver tumor exceed 5 cm great axial dimension . Multifocal lesion restrict maximum 3 lesion maximum lesion size 3 cm lesion , treat within single target volume within liver segment long dose constraint normal tissue meet . 3 . Volumn uninvolved liver &gt; 750 cc 4 . Hepatic lesion patient surgical resection possible patient refuse surgery . 5 . Eastern Clinical Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 2 ( Appendix I ) 6 . Patients liver disease classify Child Pugh class A 7 . Life expectancy &gt; 6 month 8 . Age &gt; 18 year old 9 . Albumin &gt; 2.5 g/dL 10 . Total Bilirubin &lt; 3 mg/dL 11 . INR &lt; 1.5 12 . Transaminases ( SGOT SGPT ) 3 time upper limit normal 13 . Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL 14 . Both men woman member race ethnic group eligible study 15 . Ability research subject authorize legal representative understand willingness sign write informed consent document Exclusion Criteria 1 . Prior surgery , chemotherapy radiation liver tumor 2 . Prior radiotherapy upper abdomen 3 . Prior RFA liver transplant 4 . Tumors great 5 cm great axial dimension 5 . Child B status 6 . Contraindication receive radiotherapy 7 . Active gastrointestinal bleed within 2 week study enrollment 8 . Clinically significant ascites refractory medical therapy 9 . Women pregnant 10 . Administration systemic chemotherapy within last 6 month 11 . Presence multifocal lesion locate different lobe liver extrahepatic metastasis 12 . Portal vein thrombus 13 . Participation another concurrent treatment protocol Intervention Mode Delivery : CyberKnife SBRT - External photon radiation . Procedure outpatient . Synchrony Respiratory Tracking System Duration Intervention Evaluation : The duration treatment 1 week.. The follow-up period 3 year follow completion therapy .</detailed_description>
