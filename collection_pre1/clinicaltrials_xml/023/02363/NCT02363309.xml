	<brief_summary>Background : - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) common cause abnormal liver test . It closely link health problem like obesity diabetes . Researchers want use breath test measure metabolism fatty acid learn cause disease . They compare result people NAFLD . They also repeat test people NAFLD treatment see improvement . Objectives : - To measure metabolism fatty acid compare people NAFLD , people NAFLD treatment . Eligibility : - People age 21 old NAFLD - Healthy volunteer Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , fast blood test . - Participants fast overnight . - Participants sit comfortable chair . They relax 15 minute . Then narrow plastic tube put nostril . It connect breath test device . - Participants drink palmitate acetate heat liquid meal ( Ensure ) . Palmitate fatty acid acetate small molecule build block fatty acid . Both palmitate acetate natural compound body food . - Participants sit 6 hour . They read , watch television , work computer , relaxed activity . The air breathe nose collect analyze . They may take bathroom break 3 hour . They may drink water 3 hour . - Participants get meal test . - Participants another visit least 1 week later . They repeat test compound ( acetate palmitate ) . - Participants may ask repeat test study result change like weight loss medicine . Thus , participation last 1 week several year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palmitate Breath Test Assess Fatty Acid Oxidation Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NAFLD common cause liver enzyme abnormality western world . It estimate affect approximately 30 % US population closely associate metabolic syndrome insulin resistance . Dysregulation fatty acid metabolism abnormal function adipose tissue think major feature insulin resistance NAFLD . Whether fatty acid oxidation also dysregulated patient NAFLD unclear . In study aim measure total-body fatty acid oxidation oral fat load use BreathID breath test device meal contain 13C-labeled palmitate . Results compare patient NAFLD , healthy control patient metabolic syndrome NAFLD , well within NAFLD patient therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>
