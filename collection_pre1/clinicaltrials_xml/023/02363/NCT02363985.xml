	<detailed_description>Vitamin A deficiency lead cause preventable blindness child associate high risk five mortality . Approximately 250,000 500,000 child develop country become blind year owe vitamin A deficiency , high prevalence South Asia Africa . In Africa , many country implement vitamin A intervention mega-dose supplementation child 5 year , sometimes combination food fortification program . Vitamin A deficiency major nutritional concern ; 37.7 % five child vitamin A deficient serum retinol 50.7 % sick previous 15 day Ethiopia . Vitamin A deficiency address country vitamin A supplementation every six month 6-59 month child first 45 day delivery lactate mother . There also vitamin A intervention program like bio-fortification orange flesh sweet potato ( OFSP ) pocket area . Unfortunately , assess vitamin A status , effectiveness government intervention , challenge setting infectious disease endemic , African country include Ethiopia . This serum retinol concentration decrease infection due acute phase response . The overall national prevalence helminthes infection Ethiopia 29.8 % variable degree prevalence among region , southern nation nationality people ( SNNP ) ( 51 % ) Gambella ( 51 % ) high prevalence . A survey 13 food education program-supported school SNNP region indicate prevalence soil transmit helminthiasis infection 44.4 % . The proportion school child infect parasite specie 55.4 % . A. lumbricoides prevalent specie 32.1 % , follow hookworm 21.7 % . Forty seven subject ( 26 male 21 female ) meet survey definition smear positive tuberculosis ( TB ) case , prevalence 108/100,000 ( 72-138 ) . From smear positive TB case , 37 ( 78.7 % ) new case , 2 ( 4.3 % ) treatment , 8 ( 17 % ) previously treat last five year . Malaria prevalence 4.5 % malaria endemic area . Evaluation Vitamin A status relatively insensitive base change serum retinol , homeostatically control negatively affected subclinical infection . Liver store vitamin A best indicator vitamin A status , routinely evaluate . The isotope dilution technique prefer method determine vitamin A status assess efficiency effectiveness intervention program . It indirect assessment method provide quantitative estimate vitamin A status across continuum deficient excessive vitamin A . Hence , project ass vitamin A inflammatory status 3-5 year old child 4-5 month semi-annual mega-dose vitamin A supplementation . The result indicate proportion sample child low , normal high vitamin A status , inflammation ( obesity recent infection injury ) affect assessment vitamin A status use different vitamin A assessment method , status differs country , possible association food fortification practice . Gap /Problem /Needs Analysis The combination infectious disease malnutrition prevalent , preventable public health problem world , responsible million death annually , particularly infant child . Approximately 13 million child die year develop country infectious disease , majority death relate malnutrition . The relationship infection malnutrition synergistic , compromise outcome . Malnutrition compromise natural immunity lead increased susceptibility infection , frequent prolong disease episode , increase severity disease . Likewise , infection aggravate precipitate malnutrition decrease appetite food intake , nutrient mal-absorption , nutrient loss increase metabolic need . Severe malnutrition often mask symptom sign infectious disease make prompt clinical diagnosis treatment difficult . Another issue infection ( well overweight obesity status ) affect nutritional biomarkers make difficult assess real magnitude nutritional problem . This case vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency define severe public health importance 20 % defined population serum retinol concentration le 0.7 µmol/L . However , circulate concentration serum retinol reduce infection situation serum retinol concentration good indicator vitamin A status . Infections accompany acute phase response , serum acute-phase protein indicate severity duration infection . Acute-phase protein , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , increase within first 6h infection , reach maximum concentration within 24-48h . However , α1-acid-glycoprotein ( AGP ) rise slowly , maximum concentration 2-5 day infection . Vitamin A deficiency major nutritional concern poor society affect 190 million child globally . Vitamin A essential nutrient need visual system , maintenance cell function growth , epithelial integrity , red blood cell production , immunity reproduction . All infant bear low store depend vitamin A breast milk initially accumulate maintain adequate store . Infants vitamin A depleted woman great risk become vitamin A deficient early life , especially breast fed . Correcting vitamin A deficiency addressed African country vitamin A supplementation child food fortification program . However , assess vitamin A status , effectiveness government intervention , challenge setting infectious disease endemic , African country . Evaluation vitamin A status relatively insensitive base change serum retinol concentration , homeostatically control negatively affected subclinical infection . Liver store vitamin A , best indicator vitamin A status , routinely evaluate . The isotope dilution technique prefer method determine vitamin A status assess efficacy effectiveness intervention program aim improve vitamin A status . It indirect assessment method provide quantitative estimate vitamin A status across continuum deficient excessive store . Thus , technique use assess vitamin A status population risk excessive status due exposure much vitamin A combined supplementation consumption fortify food and/or preform vitamin A-rich food . The aim project use nuclear technique evaluate vitamin A nutritional status young child semi-annual administration vitamin A supplement , ass relates infection status . The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) provide significant support use stable isotope assess body composition breast milk Member States Africa , establish stable isotope technique ass vitamin A body store Cameroon Zambia ( additional implementation possible country ) use throughout region . These input use project provide key information stakeholder vitamin A intervention program affect vitamin A status child infection affect vitamin A status validity stable isotope technique . Role nuclear technology The nuclear technique use deuterated- 13 Carbon-retinol body pool measurement assess vitamin A status . These nuclear method useful across continuum nutritional status deficient adequate excess , contrast common measurement serum retinol concentration . In addition , presence infection/inflammation less likely interfere interpretation nuclear method serum retinol method , investigated series study . This method already establish 2-3 country serum retinol method establish approximately 8 country . Further use deuterated retinol body pool size nuclear method contribute capacity building Africa , vitamin A supplementation child widespread fortification routine . The combination multiple vitamin A intervention require continuous monitoring . The IAEA expect provide technical logistical support use isotope dilution method facilitate Fellowships , Training , Scientific Visits , Expert Missions Supplies .</detailed_description>
