	<brief_title>Primary Fascial Closure With Laparoscopic Ventral Hernia Repair : A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : While randomize controlled trial demonstrate laparoscopic ventral hernia repair ( LVHR ) compare open repair associate decreased rate surgical site infection ( SSI ) short lengths hospital stay , adoption LVHR limit . Less one-fourth ventral hernia repair laparoscopic approach United States . One main reason cite lack widespread adoption LVHR failure improve patient symptom . Following LVHR , 70 % patient continue complain abdominal bulge one-third patient complain poor function . The investigator previously report primary fascial closure ( PFC ) LVHR feasible compare case-matched control , PFC improve outcome recurrence , bulge , patient function . Hypotheses : Primary Hypothesis : In patient undergo LVHR , PFC oppose bridge repair improve patient report satisfaction function 6 month follow-up . Secondary Hypotheses : ( 1 ) PFC safe feasible perform general surgeon facile LVHR . Compared bridge LVHR , ( 2 ) PFC decrease recurrence rate ( 3 ) PFC decrease rate clinician-diagnosed eventration follow LVHR . Methods : A randomized control trial compare outcomes two method LVHR : bridge repair mesh PFC mesh perform . PFC estimate improve patient satisfaction patient function composite score validate hernia-specific Modified Activities Assessment Scale ( best score 100 ) 72 ± 14 79 ± 11 . Assuming 20 % attenuation treatment effect , two-sided alpha 0.05 beta 0.20 , 20 % dropout rate , 176 patient need randomize ( n=88/group ) . The investigator ' healthcare system perform 300 LVHRs last year . The investigator anticipate able accrue sample size 12 month . Randomization Allocation : In operating room , prior mesh placement , patient randomize use computer-generated sequence variable permute block . Allocation phone call study office . Data Collection Outcomes : A surgeon blind treatment allocation perform post-operative assessment 14 day , 30 day , 6 month post-operative . The primary outcome patient-reported satisfaction function assess validate , hernia-specific survey , modified Activities Assessment Scale . Secondary outcome include intra-operative complication relate PFC , hernia recurrence , clinician-assessed eventration , Dindo-Clavien 2-5 complication . Other patient report outcome assess include likelihood undergo surgery , likelihood recommend surgery family friend , level pain . Analysis : The primary outcome compare use Wilcoxon Rank Sum test . A Bayesian analysis perform determine posterior point estimate , credible interval , probability decrease hernia recurrence PFC calculate . Anticipated Results : This study provide patient provider high-quality information risk benefit PFC versus bridge repair LVHR . If efficacious , multi-center effectiveness trial assess long-term outcome hernia recurrence perform .</detailed_description>
