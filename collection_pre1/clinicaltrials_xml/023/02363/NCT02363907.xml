	<brief_title>Observational Study Evaluate Effectiveness Safety Dexcom G4 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System Pediatrics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Performance system primarily evaluate compare blood glucose measurement reference device , blood glucose meter , CGM System value collect study . Specifically , performance primarily evaluate term proportion G4 System value within ±20 % glucose meter reference value glucose level &gt; 80 mg/dL ±20 mg/dL glucose meter reference value &lt; 80 mg/dL . These G4-meter match pair analyze across 7 day wear . Safety data CGM System also collect safety characterize incidence anticipate device-related adverse event ( ADEs ) subject participate study .</detailed_description>
