	<brief_summary>Background : - Ebola viral infection spread quickly cause life-threatening disease . Right Ebola outbreak many country West Africa . There approved treatment Ebola . But possible treatment develop . Researchers need study treatment see help people get well . Objective : - To identify possible Ebola treatment . Also , learn add 1 experimental drug advance Ebola care reduce risk death . Eligibility : - People recently diagnose Ebola , usually test call Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) , hospitalize isolation unit treatment . Design : - Participants randomly assign Group A B . Both group get advanced level care . One group also get experimental drug . - Participants may blood test . They may another PCR test . - Researchers try learn participant get Ebola . - Participants put experimental drug group may start take medicine within 24 hour enrollment . It may give mouth intravenously . Additional dos may need . - Participants may series time blood test first 24 48 hour take medicine . - Blood drawn frequently . Other body fluid ( urine , stool , vaginal fluid , etc . ) may also collect . - Participants follow 60 day . They may evaluate long-term effect experimental treatment ( ) . They may ask return 1 outpatient visit . - For consent participant , follow-up extend one full year past Day 58 contact/visits every 1-3 month ass history sign symptom potentially consistent late onset virologic relapse syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Putative Investigational Therapeutics Treatment Patients With Known Ebola Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ebolaviruses ( EBOV ) member Filoviridae know primarily underlie cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever disturbingly high case fatality rate . Between 1994 present , many EBOV outbreak affect mostly central Africa , 2 large outbreak 1995 Kikwit , Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) , Gulu , Uganda 2000-2001 . However , 2014 West African outbreak significantly exceed previous outbreak geographic range , number patient affect , disruption typical activity civil society . There strong consensus important element necessary improve survival Ebola infection provision full hemodynamic support form aggressive fluid replacement , ability diagnose correct severe metabolic derangement , standard modern medical care available resource-rich environment . However , background , small series investigational agent intervention also propose putative antiviral strategy potential utility treat infection . Unfortunately , phase 1/2 data support safety efficacy agent generally lack , thus equipoise , , intervention utilize treatment severe infection . In multicenter randomize trial , propose flexible trial design frequent interim monitoring facilitate early elimination poorly perform treatment well introduction new candidate therapy . The trial allow series pairwise comparison novel intervention background optimized medical care , goal determine whether one intervention improve mortality achievable optimize standard-of- care ( oSOC ) alone . The primary endpoint trial comparative mortality Day 28 , number secondary endpoint hopefully generate generalizable knowledge relative safety antiviral activity adjunctive intervention .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Males female document positive PCR Ebola virus infection within 10 day enrollment Willingness study participant accept randomization assign treatment arm Access oSOC All male female childbearing potential , must willing use highly effective method contraception [ e.g . absolute abstinence potentially reproductive sexual activity , hormonal , surgical multiple barrier/combined ] , time enrollment duration study participation . Must agree enroll another study investigational agent prior completion last require protocol visit ( Day 58 ) Ability provide inform consent personally , legallyauthorized [ per applicable local law regulation ] representative [ LAR ] patient unable . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any medical condition , opinion site investigator , would place patient unreasonably increase risk participation study , include past concurrent condition would preclude randomization one assign treatment arm . Prior treatment investigational antiviral drug therapy Ebola infection experimental vaccine , within 5 halflives 30 day , whichever longer , prior enrollment</criteria>
