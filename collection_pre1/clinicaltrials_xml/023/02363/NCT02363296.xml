	<brief_summary>Background : - Brain activity change change body temperature . Brain activity study procedure call transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . Researchers want cool brain scalp use cool cap . They want see cool change brain body response TMS . Objectives : - To look effect cool brain . Eligibility : - Right-handed adult age 18 50 abstain caffeine tobacco . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They ask alcohol use , smoking , substance abuse . They may take pregnancy test . They may magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain . For MRI , participant lie table slide metal tube take picture . - Participants 3 outpatient visit . The following procedure occur visit . - Participants wear cool cap 45 minute . Cool water flow cap . It feel like ice pack towel . Their core temperature monitor . Their temperature also measure tongue scalp , stomach , forearm , calf . - Participants TMS wear cap . A brief electrical current pas wire coil hold scalp . Electrodes detect muscle movement place hand . They also repetitive TMS , use repeat magnetic pulse . Their wrist also receive shock .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Objective The dysregulation synaptic transmission certain brain area may responsible neurological disorder . It demonstrate synaptic transmission may modulate repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , may component therapeutic effect rTMS . However , rTMS utility limit due inability focus stimulation . Cooling show reduce neuronal activity target brain area . The goal protocol examine ability cool affect rTMS . 2 . Study population We intend study 18 adult healthy volunteer outpatient basis . The accrual ceiling request 23 subject allow dropout screen failure . 3 . Design We propose use rapid-rate pair associative stimulation ( rPAS ) , modulate apply cool scalp , examine effect cool rTMS . Our hypothesis cool brain prevent potentiation normally induced rPAS . We reduce brain temperature 1.5o C apply cool helmet scalp test effect potentiation apply rPAS . - This study consist one experiment with18 subject . The experiment divide three session , carry least 1 day apart . - The control potentiation response rPAS without cool measure session 1 use TMS-evoked motor evoke potential ( MEP ) . In session 2 , apply commercially available liquid cool helmet 45 minute reduce temperature underlie cerebral cortex 1.5oC , assess response rPAS . In session 3 , MEP measure apply cool helmet rPAS procedure substitute sham rPAS . Session 3 necessary determine change MEP response cool alone . Thus , three session , evaluate cool alone , rPAS alone , two together . 4 . Outcome measure The primary outcome measure amplitude MEPs induce single TMS pulse</detailed_description>
