	<detailed_description>At time diagnosis , 20-25 % patient colorectal cancer ( CRC ) present synchronous liver metastasis ( SLM ) majority patient ( 80-90 % ) liver metastases unsuitable curative surgical treatment . Whether either primary tumour ( PT ) resection follow chemotherapy immediate chemotherapy without PT resection best therapeutic option patient asymptomatic colon cancer unresectable SLM still controversial . No randomised trial conduct answer question . Historically , surgeon advocate resection PT avoid potential complication intact PT ( bleeding , obstruction , perforation ) . However , past decade , several highly active systemic agent become available treatment patient metastatic CRC . These agent increase median survival duration patient unresectable metastatic disease 9 12 month 5FU alone , 30-35 month addition modern cytotoxic target agent . Modern agent also demonstrate increased activity PT well , associate low rate PT-related complication treatment initially asymptomatic patient . The impact strategy survival never assess properly . All publish study non-randomized design , single center , retrospective . Moreover , data use systemic therapy present study , make difficult assess relative contribution resection outcome . In addition , patient extensive disease poor performance status likely offer chemotherapy rather surgery thus introduce bias oust . Despite limitation , PT resection initial management metastatic CRC patient unresectable SLM relate prolonged survival multivariate analysis majority series . The improvement survival follow PT resection may attribute potential role PT provide angiogenic prosperous environment metastatic tumour growth liver parenchyma adjacent SLM . The present study multicenter randomize phase III trial design ass whether overall survival quality life improve patient asymptomatic unresectable metastatic colon cancer treat surgery follow chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone . Patients ( ECOG 0-1 performance status ) asymptomatic colon cancer ( &gt; 15cm anal margin ) unresectable liver metastatic disease initial abdominal CT/MRI scan randomize either colectomy follow chemotherapy , chemotherapy without resection PT . Systemic chemotherapy without targeted therapy let investigator ' discretion accord standard local practice . The primary endpoint study overall survival &gt; 2 year . The secondary endpoint : quality life ( EORTC QLQ-C30 , QLQ-CR29 ) , treatment safety ( postoperative morbidity , complication relate unresected PT , chemotherapy toxicity ) , progression-free survival time metastatic progression , radiological response chemotherapy ( RECIST v1.1 criterion ) , curative ( R0 ) resection rate metastasis . A 15 % amelioration overall survival 2 year expect colectomy group ( HR=0.65 , rise 40 % 55 % ) . Using two side α level 5 % , 180 event require detect difference power 80 % ( β=0.20 ) . Taking account expect accrual 15 patient per month 19 month , minimum follow-up 28 month 5 % rate lose follow-up , 278 patient include . The final analysis endpoint conduct 28 month last inclusion . The total duration study approximately 4 year . A translational study conduct evaluate serum alter DNA patent test ( AP-HP , 31 January 2008 n°08/00543 ) develop colon cancer diagnosis , prognostic marker treatment response tool . A radiological study conduct identify angiogenesis change within around liver metastasis resection PT . In addition morphological sequence allow use RECIST1.1 , DCE DWI sequence perform order calculate ADC value lesion well Ktrans , Kep , PS describe cellularity perfusion lesion . An optional ultrasound examination use SWE study stiffness liver metastasis propose end MRI examination .</detailed_description>
