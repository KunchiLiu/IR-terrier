	<brief_title>Glembatumumab Vedotin Treating Patients With Metastatic Locally Recurrent Uveal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize clinical anti-tumor activity CDX-011 ( glembatumumab vedotin ) single-agent treatment patient metastatic uveal melanoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Description clinical safety benefit CDX-011 ( glembatumumab vedotin ) pharmacodynamics change glycoprotein NMB ( glycoprotein [ transmembrane ] NMB ) ( GPNMB ) expression . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Characterization anti-tumor immunophenotype patient receive treatment . II . Post hoc , correlation rash clinical benefit , lack rash lack benefit , also explore . OUTLINE : Patients receive glembatumumab vedotin intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
