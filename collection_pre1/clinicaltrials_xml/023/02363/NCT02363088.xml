	<brief_summary>Cervical cancer common cancer woman 35 year major public health concern . Fortunately , natural history malignancy beneficially improve cytological screening . However , success screen programme depend ability attract `` risk '' population , well analytical sensitivity specificity screen test . In UK , screen consistently fall short 80 % national target recent evidence show uptake decreasing , part due introduction HPV vaccination programme . In 30 London population , average coverage reach 50 % 2013 . Given information , cervical screening programme increase pressure improve uptake , need evidence base intervention . We aim improve uptake cervical screening use SMS message randomise control trial . The trail evaluate prevalent incident round screen within intervention group , analyse content text reminder influence effectiveness . Specifically evaluate ) neutral b ) messenger c ) social norm ) frame gain/loss reminder . Unlike previous trial , SMS reminder encourage book appointment never test , rather simply remind woman attend . All woman invite cervical screening , register participate GPs within Hillingdon eligible participate . Women also provide 2 week window opt research .

	<brief_title>Can Text Reminders Improve Uptake Cervical Screening ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Hillingdon specifically , randomise control trial ( RCT ) set , uptake prevalent population woman ( 24-29 year proxy ) , 35 % 2012 , whilst incident population ( 30-64years proxy ) slightly high 51 % ( HSCIC2 , 2013 ) . One strategy healthcare previously employ improve uptake screen routine appointment use SMS `` text message '' reminder . Standard reminder often use healthcare act `` primer '' , prompt people make healthy choice ( Blumenthal-Barby &amp; Burroughs , 2012 ) . They also serve reduce practical barrier prevent woman attend i.e . failure book remember time/location appointment . Previous research investigate effectiveness appointment reminder demonstrate telephone postal reminder , although time effective , often impractical , unsustainable , and/or unaffordable ( Gurol-Urganci et al , 2013 , Perron et al , 2013 ) . SMS intervention effective improve medication adherence , disease management smoking cessation ( Krishna et al , 2013 ; Abroms et al , 2014 ) . They also prove effective reduce `` Do Not Attends '' ( DNAs ) within healthcare , estimate cost NHS Â£600 million per year waste time resource ( Dr Foster Research , 2009 ) . SMS reminder also find successful increase attendance breast screen appointment , increase uptake 17 % compare usual care ( Kerrison et al , 2013 ) . As well improve attendance , SMS reminder also prove effective reducing cost , increase efficiency clinic , enable effective booking , reduce mismatch demand capacity , generally help increase productivity within healthcare . SMS intervention many benefit alternative medium . Firstly SMS cheap , roughly 3p per text whilst letter cost 10 time . SMS also capable reach recipient wherever whilst letter deliver recipient last known address . This particularly important , people likely retain mobile number nowadays even change address , especially London population notoriously mobile . Mobile phone use also ubiquitous UK , recent report estimate 99 % adult London own mobile phone 2013 ( Ofcom , 2013 ) . Another advantage SMS evidence people increasingly use electronic day planner therefore message direct person 's phone encourage people promptly record appointment even allow set alarm create reminder . SMS intervention would therefore wide reach postal intervention ( ) fraction cost great accuracy . Although previous evidence provide sound rationale SMS intervention great potential cervical screening , still considerable amount information require order introduce intervention standard practice . The research also aim evaluate whether minor difference word affect woman 's response message . This idea stem `` Nudge '' theory , form Libertarian Paternalism `` Asymmetric Paternalism '' ( Thaler Sunstein , 2003 ) . This concept derive mix cognitive psychology behavioural science base principal human , due lack information , experience , cognitive ability self-control , often fail act way promotes welfare ( Sunstein Thaler , 2003 ) . Libertarian paternalism therefore encourage individual act , and/or society , best interest whilst maintain freedom choice ( Aggarwal et al 2014 ) . Although use `` nudge '' view controversial within healthcare , study justify use avoid form coercion , make clear text simply reminder normal invitation process . There mount evidence demonstrate even small change content frame heavily influence people decision ( Haynes et al , 2013 ; Hallsworth et al , 2014 ) . Whether positive effect small wording change `` nudge '' reflect woman 's attitude towards cervical screening program yet evaluate . This information crucial order maximise efficiency intervention knowledge gain could apply similar intervention healthcare make cost effective . We also hope evaluate whether people different level deprivation respond differently different message . This hugely important , tailoring message population crucial improve efficiency intervention reduce health inequality within London . In light evidence choose seven different text message option , accord research great potential improve uptake screening . These include control text message , neutral reminder five reminder behavioural message prompt uptake . The intervention arm accord research great potential improve uptake screening . It well establish reduce effort require perform action increase likelihood follow-through ( Leventhal et al , 1965 ) . All text message begin test message , follow standard reminder message constant across message participant GP practice phone number . The chosen message text message , neutral message ; messenger ; two social norm ; gain frame loss frame highlight benefit cervical screening . Neutral Reminder The neutral message `` nudge '' simply remind woman book cervical screening appointment , act direct reminder letter invitation send normal practice . It act control types message . `` Your cervical smear test due . To book please call &lt; xxxxxxxxxxx &gt; '' Messenger Reminder Some evidence suggest people respond good invitation personal practice rather centralise NHS organisation ( Segan et al , 1998 ; Arbyn et al , 2010 ) . This especially true young woman , immigrant , urban resident low socioeconomic status , key demographic hope improve uptake intervention ( Bosgraaf et al , 2013 ) . `` &lt; GP NAME &gt; : Your cervical smear test due . To book please call &lt; xxxxxxxxxxx &gt; '' Social Norms Messages Social norm message focus principal people tendency overestimate extent peer perform act , cause others harm . Evidence suggest educate people actual degree people perform act alter behaviour ( Perkins et al , 2002 ) . This theory , combine fact people strongly influence comparison others hopefully prompt woman take offer cervical screening . We also choose use local statistic personalise message great influence increase relevance message woman ( Institute government : Cabinet Office , 2010 ) 1 . Social Norms ( local , proportion ) reminder : `` Last year Hillingdon 7 10 woman take part cervical screening . Your cervical smear test due . To book please call &lt; xxxxxxxxxxx &gt; '' 2 . Social Norms ( local , total number ) reminder : `` Last year 12000 woman Hillingdon take part cervical screening . Your cervical smear test due . To book please call &lt; xxxxxxxxxxx &gt; '' Gain Loss Frame Messages The role gain loss frame messenger encourage uptake good health behaviour entirely clear . Some evidence point humans `` strong aversion loss affinity gain '' therefore highlight loss may great impact ( Blumenthal-Barby &amp; Burroughs , 2012 ) . On hand meta-analysis find gain frame likely effective change prevention behaviour . ( Gallagher , 2001 ) . To evaluate gain loss frame message include . Statistics include message take ( Peto , 2004 ) correlate widely use statistic cancerscreening.nhs.uk maintain consistency information woman might see . 1 . Gain frame `` Cervical cancer screen save 4500 life England every year . Your cervical smear test due . To book please call &lt; xxxxxxxxxxx &gt; '' 2 . Loss frame `` Failing attend cervical screening could lead 4500 avoidable death England year . Your cervical smear test due . To book please call &lt; xxxxxxxxxxx &gt; '' POTENTIAL ETHICAL ISSUES The main ethical issue order analyse data , researcher need access minimal amount patient data . The researcher specifically need access list woman Hillingdon send invitation cervical screen weekly basis , register consent GP . All participate GPs ( date include 85 % approached trial ) consent share relevant data research team happy safeguard put place protect confidentiality . These include NHS secure email , password protection patient data , anonymisation data ( identifiable NHS number ) strict adherence NHS information governance regulation . On list , participant identify NHS number , unique identifier . The researcher also need information age ( date birth ) , participants `` attended/not attend status '' end 18 week follow period GP practice code , ensure include woman register consent GPs . We would also like access second half participant ' postcode allow basic deprivation analysis . Before access information offer woman option opt research therefore share data receive text message reminder . This achieve cervical screening ( call-recall ) team add insert behalf GP , screen invitation letter eligible woman . This insert provide inform consent slip contact detail researcher woman would like information . They 2 week respond remove study . As extension research , trial also investigate variation word text message affect uptake . This word carefully select guidance NHS Cervical Screening Program ( NHSCSP ) well Public Health England psychology expert data within text message date source NHSCS .</detailed_description>
