	<brief_summary>Medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) uncommon thyroid malignancy comprise 5 % thyroid cancer . The National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) estimate 56,460 Americans diagnose thyroid cancer 1,780 die disease 2012 . Early disease usually confine thyroid cure surgery . Unfortunately , 50 % case diagnose locally advanced metastatic disease , 10-year survival 40 % . In tumor , well MTC , single-agent inhibitor therapy face numerous problem often provide patient limited benefit . In study , investigator use result previous study Drosophila animal model combine extensive pretesting genetic analysis sample take patient ' individual tumor use potentially develop personalize therapeutic plan enrol . In study , investigator offer treat patient personalize therapeutic plan ( able develop one prior study ) . This therapeutic clinical trial investigator provide personalized therapy patient medullary thyroid cancer base Personalized Therapeutic Plan ( PTP ) develop separate Tumor Genomic Analysis Molecular Testing Personalized Cancer Therapy protocol ( GCO # 14-0054 ( 0001 ) MSSM ) . This therapeutic protocol applies treatment period Personalized Medicine . The objective establish superiority Personalized Medicine term efficacy ( Overall Response Rate ) MTC patient , substantially similar efficacy reduce toxicity , compare best standard care option recurrent/metastatic MTC ( currently cabozantinib ) demonstrate phase III trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients offer option consent enrollment receive care base personalize treatment plan develop separate Tumor Genomic Analysis Molecular Testing Personalized Caner Therapy protocol . Each patient enrol therapeutic study consent use individualized consent form address respective personalize treatment plan associate risk . No genetic sequencing , test involve fly animal conduct therapeutic protocol . This protocol apply treatment phase personalize medicine . Study participation expect last 2-3 year . Personalized Treatment Plan Since personalize treatment plan may , probably , different respect registration label FDA indication , body expert establish Pharmacology Committee review ADMET data drug select regimen . For case , refer medical oncologist provide clinical presentation patient ` history cancer previous therapy , well important medical history Multidisciplinary Tumor Board Experts ( MTBE ) consist two pharmacologist scientist select experience drug selection , research clinical pharmacist , 2 medical oncologist expertise phase 2 clinical trial , member IRB , two medical oncologist expertise patient 's tumor type include treat physician two scientist perform drug prediction test . Except clinician investigator directly involve patient 's care , member MTBE independent group avoid risk bias . The composition committee vary individual may add process move forward . A study subject allow start personalize therapeutic plan final informed consent approve IRB sign study subject . Once enrolled personalized therapy , study subject receive treatment base PTP dose adjustment accord manufacturer label information and/or PDR Electronic Library . Any controversial , incidental , unexpected finding treatment present MTBE-called ad hoc , board decide continuation , dose adjustment modification study subject ` personalized therapeutic treatment plan . The Personalized Treatment Plan ( PTP ) stop upon disease progression . However , standard therapy clinical trial available time progression , subject progressive disease option treat one graded therapy discuss initial MTBE meeting ( 5 therapeutic plan . They require sign separate inform consent include statistical analysis protocol . All statistic descriptive nature exploratory .</detailed_description>
