Safety assess follow laboratory evaluation : complete blood count ( CBC ) differential , complete metabolic panel ( CMP ) , toxicity assessment . This study design 90 % power detect increase 50 % responder rate maintenance period benchmark 20 % 35 % . Assuming type I error rate 0.1 , 61 patient require . Based prior study early discontinuation rate 16 % , therefore 71 patient enrolled compensate patient discontinue prior completion maintenance period .</detailed_description>
