	<brief_summary>The investigator propose evaluate novel incentive intervention promote suppression viral load people live HIV employ empirically-based parameter proven critical effectiveness incentive intervention . Participants ( N = 200 ) medical clinic serve adult live HIV Baltimore randomly assign Incentive Usual Care Control group . Incentive group participant receive incentive maintain suppress undetectable viral load . The incentive program employ high magnitude incentive , provide incentive decrease viral load early treatment patient 's viral load reach undetectable level , arrange frequent incentive early treatment reduce frequency incentive participant achieve progressively long period viral load suppression , arrange schedule escalate incentive sustain suppression viral load , intervention maintain two year . Usual Care Control participant receive standard HIV medical care offer clinic . Assessments conduct every 3 month throughout two year treatment every 6 month throughout year follow treatment . The primary outcome measure percentage participant undetectable viral load 3-month assessment conduct throughout 2-year intervention period . Secondary measure include adherence HIV care post-treatment outcome . The investigator also assess moderator mediator effect incentive suppression viral load , conduct cost-effectiveness cost-benefit analysis . If incentive intervention maintains suppress viral load economically sound , could use improve health adult live HIV , reduce health care cost , reduce HIV transmission community .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Experimental Design . Participants ( N = 200 ) randomly assign Usual Care Control group Incentive group . A computerized urn randomization procedure ( Wei &amp; Lachin , 1988 ) use balance group five baseline characteristic may influence outcome : ( 1 ) DSM V dependence cocaine opiate assess CIDI ( Y/N ) ; ( 2 ) DSM V alcohol dependence assess CIDI ( Y/N ) ; ( 3 ) health literacy assess TOFHLA ( score ≤ roll median , Y/N ) ; ( 4 ) impulsivity assess delay discounting ( k value raw discounting data participant , index impulsivity ( ≤ roll median k , Y/N ) ; ( 5 ) depression assess Beck Depression Inventory ( score ≤ roll median , Y/N ) . Participants stratify DSM V cocaine , opiate alcohol dependence , health literacy , depression intake drug use ( Mimiaga et al. , 2013 ) , health literacy ( Kalichman et al. , 2008 ) , depression ( Murphy et al . 2013 ) associate poor ART adherence . Participants stratify base measure impulsivity high level impulsivity associate poor health decision make adverse health behavior ( Axon et al . 2009 ; Bickel et al . 2014 ; Bradford et al. , 2010 ) . Standard HIV Medical Care . Upon enrollment , participant teach benefit ART adherence need maintain nearly perfect adherence . All participant receive HIV medical care clinic . Incentive Group . The Incentive group receive novel empirically-based incentive intervention promote long term suppression HIV-1 RNA ( viral load ) evaluate study . The incentive intervention employ feature parameter show critically important promote therapeutic behavior change drug user population . participant teach detail incentive program write instruction quiz . Usual Care Control Group . Usual Care Control Only participant receive standard HIV medical care describe offer medical clinic . Participants group receive add viral load testing , feedback incentive , beyond viral load test conduct routine part medical care .</detailed_description>
