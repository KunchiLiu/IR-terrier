	<brief_summary>Ineffective treatment postoperative pain may cause organic damage chronic pain . Nevertheless , opioids , lead drug use purpose , present side effect sometimes restrict usability . In multimodal context , new postoperative analgesia technique develop focus reduction opioid use adverse effect , well postoperative chronic pain prevention . In background , continuous intravenous infusion lidocaine perioperative period show promising . This trial aim compare postoperative analgesia , opioid consumption , duration ileus length hospital stay IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-10 , α TNF γ IFN level patient undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy receive intravenous lidocaine comparison control group . Intravenous lidocaine perioperative period laparoscopic cholecystectomy able reduce postoperative pain , opioid consumption , duration ileus length hospital stay . However , anti-inflammatory effect evidence significant change study cytokine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Forty-four patient undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy , general anesthesia , randomly allocate two group . The first group receive intravenous lidocaine infusion procedure one hour postoperatively ; meanwhile second group receive intravenous saline period time . The intervention double-blind . In postoperative period , group receive dipyrone morphine PCA . Pain assess Visual Numeric Scale ( VNS ) rest cough 1st , 2nd , 4th , 12th e 24th hour end surgery . Blood sample cytokine measurement take end procedure 24 hour later . The total morphine PCA demand , time first flatus length hospital stay also record compare .</detailed_description>
