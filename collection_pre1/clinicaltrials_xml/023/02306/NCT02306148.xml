	<brief_title>Effects Foot Strengthening Prevalence Injuries Long Distance Runners</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using web software follow tool , subject scan injury confirm physician , determine injury prevalence one year . Through force platform infrared camera , kinematics kinetics gait allow assessment joint moment , power propulsion , ankle knee range motion . The hypothesis strengthen program foot ankle muscle alter prevalence lower limbs injury long distance runner , lower harmful force segment receive . The participant randomly assign control group ( placebo intervention ) intervention group , receive 8 week strengthen intervention , twice week supervision physiotherapist three time week remotely supervise software home , 30 minute session . This aim increase foot ankle range movement muscle strength . Every exercise progression depend subject execution , increase intensity difficulty .</detailed_description>
