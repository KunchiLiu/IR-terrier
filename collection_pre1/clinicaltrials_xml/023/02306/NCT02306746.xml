	<detailed_description>Each year around 130,000 Australians admit ICU daily cost approximately $ 4000 per patient . Their care consumes close 3 billion dollar per year . These critically ill patient sick hospital . They require substantial resource multiple intervention . Some die many survive delayed compromise functional recovery persist month year . Nutrition therapy essential standard care ICU patient mechanically ventilate remain ICU day . Enteral nutrition ( via nasogastric tube ) usually initiate within 24 hour ICU admission formula contain 1 kcal/ml prescribe approximate rate 1 ml/kg/hour . However , standard enteral nutrition practice typically result delivery ~60 % full-recommended calorie requirement . Although prescribed calorie reliably deliver use intravenous route , enteral route prefer number reason recommend nutrition guideline first-line therapy . In particular , enteral nutrition physiological , less costly associate few infective complication . Delivery nutrient gut also beneficial effect subsequent gut function may reduce ongoing sepsis fuel movement gut flora permeable mucosa expose nutrient . Intravenous nutrition accordingly , generally use enteral feeding impossible , persistently limit . Although supplement enteral intravenous nutrition increase calorie delivery , show therapeutic benefit may worsen important clinical outcome . This may adverse effect associate intravenous nutrition counteract benefit increase calorie delivery . Previous trial support concept optimise nutrition critically ill improve outcome , however , evidence limit , inclusive generally low quality . It extraordinary well ( Level I ) evidence inform nutrition management critically ill patient give frequency intervention , biologic rationale , high mortality follow ICU admission , frequency muscle waste poor functional outcome survivor . This especially true give low cost enteral nutrition ( ~ $ 23/day ) . The investigator recently complete pilot study clearly achieve key criterion , pharmaceutical product , would lead phase III trial , namely : 1. feasibility ; 2. safety ; 3. separation ; 4. excellent recruitment rate ; 5. successful blinding ; 6. signal benefit . A definitive study must do establish whether 90-day survival functional outcome follow critical illness may improve increase calorie delivery .</detailed_description>
