	<brief_summary>Purpose : The aim prospective cohort evaluate patient , 6 12 month arthroscopic surgery FAI compare result people without hip problem . Methods/design : Sixty patient FAI 30 person without hip problem include . Pre- postoperatively , patient evaluate CT-scans . All participant hip flexor extensor muscle strength assess perform kinetic kinematic analysis daily activity 3D motion capture . Further , self-reported questionnaire hip relate pain , quality life sport activity collect . Finally , participant daily physical activity monitor tri-axial accelerometer five consecutive day . Perspectives : With prospective cohort study outcome arthroscopic treatment FAI within one year surgery evaluate . If patient fail reach reference value one year surgery , alter surgical procedure rehabilitation program optimize treatment patient may explore future study . Further , investigator expect perform long-term follow evaluate reoperations , conversion total hip arthroplasty development osteoarthritis patient surgically treat FAI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arthroscopic Treatment Patients Horsens Aarhus With FemoroAcetabular Impingement : HAFAI-cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Femoral acetabular impingement ( FAI ) cause abnormality acetabular shape orientation ( Pincer-type ) shape abnormality proximal femur ( Cam-type ) mix two condition . FAI cause repeat minor damage labrum edge acetabulum . The damage joint propose lead early osteoarthritis ( OA ) hip , whether FAI cause result OA discuss . Surgery reduce symptom cause Cam Pincer impingement may prevent future damage hip joint . However , different surgical technique use , long-term study surgery exist . The late review conclude 1 ) effectiveness surgery clear , 2 ) clear surgery affect functional performance patient 3 ) unknown surgery FAI affect patient long-term perspective . Material method Patients : Inclusion criterion - Planned hip arthroscopic treatment Horsens Regional Hospital Consultant Bent Lund - A diagnosis CAM and/or pincer impingement - For patient Cam , alpha angle &gt; 55 degree anterior/posterior ( AP ) stand radiograph - For patient Pincer center edge angle &gt; 25 degree AP radiograph - No sign retroversion low 2/3 hip joint AP radiograph - No posterior wall sign AP radiograph - Osteoarthritis grade 0-1 accord Tönnis ' classification - Lateral Joint space width &gt; 3 mm - Age 18 50 year Exclusion criterion - Previous hip operation include hip - Persons FAI secondary hip condition Calvé Perthes epiphysiolysis . - Alloplastic surgery hip , knee ankle region ( leg ) - Neurological disease - Cancer - Inability speak understand Danish - Pregnancy time inclusion Control person ( healthy volunteer ) Thirty gender age-matched person know hip , knee ankle region problem include control . Primary outcome measure - Hip pelvis kinetics kinematics walk , stair climbing , step , sit-to-stand drop jump - Hip extensor flexor maximal muscle strength isometric isokinetic contraction - Hip extensor flexor rate force development isometric contraction - Objectively measure daily physical activity 5 day - Hip- related self-reported health measure Copenhagen Hip Groin Outcome Score Secondary outcome measure - Knee trunk kinetics kinematics walk , stair climbing , step , sit-to-stand jump - Hip extensor flexor rate force development isometric contraction - Self-selected walk speed - Presence intra-articular pathology examine FABER impingement test - Visual analog scale , pain - Patient expectation - Reasons choose surgery - Patient global treatment outcome - Patient-acceptable symptom state - EQ5D-Visual analog scale - Failure - Re-operations injection first year surgery - Self-reported present sport activity - Time spend preferred sport activity present - Time spend sport activity childhood - Sports activity childhood - Return sport activity - Education - Employment - Smoking habit - Alcohol intake - Intake analgesia - Comorbidities Other Pre-specified Outcome Measures : - Alpha angle - Wiberg 's center-edge ( CE ) angle - Tönnis ' acetabular index ( AI ) - Retroversion acetabulum - The position femoral head relation neck - Osteoarthritis grade accord Tönnis ' classification - Lateral hip joint space width - Information surgical procedure immediately - Deviation rehabilitation program - Duration pain - Body Mass Index - Body fat percentage - Age Procedure Patients schedule hip arthroscopic treatment Horsens Regional Hospital receive write verbal information study inform consent include consecutively . After agree participate , patient pre-operative CT-scan included hip . At Aarhus University , patient clinical examination session include measurement height , weight fat percentage . They hip extensor flexor muscle strength assess isokinetic dynamometer perform walking , stair climbing , step , sit stand drop jump 3D-motion capture . Patients complete HAGOS-questionnaire together pre specify self-reported measure describe . After test complete , patient instruct wear 3-axial accelerometer five day , attached thigh non-affected leg monitor daily physical activity . At three , six nine month follow-up patient complete HAGOS , pain score self-reported measure return sport , work , re-operations injection surgery EQ5D-Visual analog scale . At one year follow , preoperative measure repeat . Further , six month one year follow patient report fulfillment expectation , patient global treatment outcome patient willingness repeat surgery . All control meet Aarhus University single assessment measure patient except CT-scans outcome measure relate surgery . Statistics Patients control compare multiple regression analysis adjust age , gender body weight assumption model meet . If , compare use un-paired non-parametric statistic . The longitudinal measure patient pre , three , six , nine month one year surgery evaluate paired set-up . Further analysis Based upon preoperative CT-scan , patient split subgroup : FAI classify Cam ( alpha angle &gt; 55˚ ) , Pincer ( center edge angle &gt; 25˚ CT AP radiograph and/or cross sign ishial spine sign ) Mixed combination Cam Pincer . We investigate subgroup affect outcome measure . Further , investigate demographic , preoperative postoperative muscle strength pain affect result surgery rehabilitation procedure . Sample size The primary end point study one year surgery . For muscle strength assessment , sample size base upon pre- post-operative value Casartelli et al . ( 2 ) level significance 0.05 power 90 % , patient group consist least 53 person . Taking possible drop-outs account goal include 60 patient . We include 30 control person comparison .
