	<brief_title>Assessment Diagnostic Accuracy Performance Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Compared Mammography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ADAPT program consist 2 recruitment plan ( ADAPT-SCR ADAPT-BX ) follow off-line read image data collect ( ADAPT-BIE ) . This study involve comparison two device identify abnormality routine breast screening diagnostic mammography . Mammography usually do full-field digital mammography ( FFDM ) , take flat , two-dimensional X-ray image breast . Doctors use two-dimensional image look cancer abnormal tissue . The purpose study learn accuracy full-field digital mammography device new mammography device call digital breast tomosynthesis ( DBT ) . DBT similar full-field digital mammography , also move around breast get X-ray image different angle , provide three-dimensional view doctor use look cancer abnormal tissue . Subjects undergo routine imaging FFDM also DBT perform . They continue standard care treatment would occur outside study . Based result FFDM DBT , subject 's status followed-up rout image approximately 1 year ( 10-16 month ) . If doctor recommend biopsy base FFDM DBT , information biopsy cancer determination result collect . Being study require subject biopsy recommend doctor normal medical care .</detailed_description>
