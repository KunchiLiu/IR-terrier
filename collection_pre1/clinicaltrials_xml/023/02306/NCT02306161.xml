LOCAL CONTROL THERAPY : Between week 13-18 , patient undergo surgery and/or radiation therapy . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV 1 minute day 1 week 1 , 7 , 9 , 13 ; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 1-15 minute day 1 2 week 1 7 ; cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute day 1 week 1 , 7 , 9 , 13 ; ifosfamide IV 1 hour day 1 5 week 3 , 5 , 11 , 15 ; etoposide IV 1-2 hour day 1 5 week 3 , 5 , 11 , 15 . METASTATIC SITE IRRADIATION : Patients lung metastasis undergo definitive SBRT external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) 5 day . REGIMEN B ( VDC/IE + ganitumab ) : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive Induction therapy Regimen A receive ganitumab IV 30-60 minute 60-120 minute day 1 week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 . LOCAL CONTROL THERAPY : Between week 13-18 , patient undergo surgery and/or radiation therapy . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Patients receive Consolidation therapy Regimen A ganitumab IV 30-60 minute 60-120 minute day 1 week 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 . METASTATIC SITE IRRADIATION : Patients lung metastasis undergo definitive SBRT EBRT 5 day . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive ganitumab IV 30-60 minute 60-120 minute day 1 week 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 22 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 10 year .</detailed_description>
