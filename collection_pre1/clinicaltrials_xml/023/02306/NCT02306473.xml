	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Asthma The diagnosis asthma base consistent history , physical exam , previous physician diagnosis asthma . Consistent historical feature asthma include episodic wheezing , shortness breath , chest tightness , cough , often precipitate known environmental trigger ( e.g . respiratory viral infection , exposure pollen , exercise , stress ) . Consistent physical finding asthma include audible expiratory wheeze finding associate disease ( e.g . eczema , allergic rhinitis ) , although physical exam may normal asthma attack . Subjects need free asthma symptom time challenge test . Most asthmatic subject demonstrate bronchial reactivity mannitol challenge test . Inclusion criterion : Nonasthmatic control Healthy control subject recruit order define baseline value serum urine mannitol . Healthy control subject define lack symptom physical finding asthma allergic disease ( e.g . eczema , allergic rhinitis ) , absence chronic lung disease . Healthy subject also demonstrate bronchial reactivity mannitol challenge test . 1 . &gt; 5 pack year history tobacco use active smoking . 2 . Other chronic active lung disease ( e.g . COPD , pulmonary fibrosis , lung cancer ) 3 . History significant renal insufficiency liver disease 4 . Asthma subject severe disease accord NAEPP guideline ( e.g . severe ongoing symptom despite highdose inhaled oral glucocorticoid ) 5 . Asthma subject baseline FEV1 &lt; 65 % predict 6 . Asthma subject unwilling unable withhold medication prior test 7 . Pregnant woman .</criteria>
