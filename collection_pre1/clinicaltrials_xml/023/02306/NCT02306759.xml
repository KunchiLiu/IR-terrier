	<brief_summary>The aim study compare safety &amp; efficacy low dose ketamine morphine versus morphine alone acute generalize pain Emergency Department ( ED ) . The investigator also interested investigate whether low-dose ketamine safe effective alternative option opioids acute treatment pain Emergency Department . The agent available department include acetaminophen , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ( NSAIDS ) opioids . In case , acetaminophen NSAIDS adequate manage acute pain crisis . There also heighten concern increase opioid use abuse patient . Since HCAPHS survey include various question inquire patient perception pain management department , investigator interest investigate safety efficacy low-dose ketamine alternative method opioids acute management pain . There limited , mostly observational pilot study , publish literature . Limited data literature report incidence nausea vomit range 3-13 % . All publish literature administer low-dose ketamine intravenous push . To best knowledge study would first study administer low-dose ketamine short bolus infusion mitigate incidence nausea vomit . The investigator believe study would provide important scientific data fill theoretical gap low-dose ketamine 0.3mg/kg/dose may safe effective agent acute pain management ED locate center densely populated urban area .</brief_summary>
