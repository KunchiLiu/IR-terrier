	<brief_title>A Study To Examine Safety , Pharmacokinetics , And Pharmacodynamic Of Pf 06412562 In Healthy Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design investigate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamic effect PF-06412562 follow multiple dose administration MR tablets healthy adult male . The study comprise 2 analytical stage . Both analytical stage conduct randomized , subject investigator blind , sponsor open , placebo-controlled , parallel design . Study enrollment continuous Stage I Stage II . Stage I consist approximately 45 completer subject ( approximately 15 per arm ) . Stage I exploratory hypothesis generation stage . No multiple comparison adjustment conduct Stage I analysis . The sample size Stage I base operational feasibility . All endpoint include composite score test end Stage I . Each PF-06412562 dose ( 3 mg BID 15 mg BID ) compare placebo arm endpoint . Up 5 comparison meet Stage I decision criterion treat primary comparison Stage II ( see Data Analysis section ) . Stage II hypothesis test stage multiple comparison adjust overall type I error rate control across primary comparison . Stage II formally power study endpoints/doses likely demonstrate strong pharmacodynamic signal . Stage II exceed 56 completers ( ~21 PF-06412562 arm ~14 placebo arm ) . Study enrollment continuous Stage I Stage II . The three treatment stage include ( ) PF-06412562 3 mg BID ( ii ) PF-06412562 15 mg BID , ( iii ) placebo . Separate placebo group , contemporaneous treatment group , recruit Stage I Stage II . A total approximately 101 subject randomly assign one 3 treatment . If subject drop complete study , withdraws reason unrelated safety test treatment , subject replace discretion Sponsor consultation investigator . Subjects fMRI ERP data pas image ERP data QC also replace . Subjects randomize specific treatment arm accord randomization schedule provide site Pfizer . Two dos PF-06412562 ( 3 mg 15 mg ) , administer MR tablet , give twice daily ( BID ) Day 1 Day 6 . A load dose PF-06412562 administer IR tablet Day 1 facilitate rapid attainment concentration target range . For subject assign 3 mg BID group , one 3 mg MR tablet one 1 mg PF-06412562 IR tablet administer . For subject assign 15 mg BID group , one 15 mg MR tablet one 5 mg IR dose PF-06412562 administer . On Day 7 morning dose administer . Subject participation approximately 12 day ( 11 night ) , exclude screen follow-up . Screening activity complete 28 day prior admission study Day -3 . The follow-up visit conduct approximately 7 10 day last dose study drug administration . Medically healthy , right-handed male subject , age 18-45 screened work memory capacity , psychiatric disorder cognitive/educational constrains . Subjects meet entry criterion randomize one three treatment arm .</detailed_description>
