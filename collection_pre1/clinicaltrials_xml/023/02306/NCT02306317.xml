	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether saturation control parent child young 32 week 1500 g versus conventional care perform nursing increase time patient remain optimal saturation range . If hypothesis study confirm premature infant could prevent episode hypoxia-hyperoxia also give relevance role parent care child admit neonatal intensive care unit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Adding Value Parents Nursing Care Control FiO2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both episode hyperoxia hypoxemia preterm infant increase morbidity mortality . Nowadays adjustment FiO2 manually control , mean depends staff , need multiple adjustment throughout day . The investigator 's hypothesis FiO2 control parent , improve percentage time range optimum saturation least 10 % compare control nurse . The aim study compare proportion time oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) within assign target range , preterm infant whose parent modify fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) versus nurse staff modify group . This randomize controlled clinical study neonatal intensive care unit Hospital 12 de Octubre . Patients randomize two group , Experimental Group : parent control saturation range , manually adjust FiO2 versus Control Group : control nursing staff ( standard procedure ) . Saturations register adjustment FiO2 film nonconsecutive 20-hours period . Twenty-three patient enrol group .</detailed_description>
