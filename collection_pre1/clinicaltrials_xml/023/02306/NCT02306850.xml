	<detailed_description>This study do see use study drug , pembrolizumab , shrink melanoma tumor enough small enough cut , cancer leave body . Eligible participant include receive systemic melanoma therapy ( i.e . participant fail ipilimumab BRAF inhibitor ) fail available systemic option ( participant meet inclusion / exclusion criterion ) . For melanoma case , surgery recommend treatment . Until recently surgery use patient advanced melanoma ( melanoma spread lymph node melanoma spread organ like lung , liver , brain ) think surgery would n't help patient live long melanoma tumor spread beyond skin . Recent study show patient advance melanoma surgery one treatment may live long patient systemic therapy ( IV drug pill ) surgery . Unfortunately , patient advance melanoma come doctor , surgery good choice patient 'unresectable ' melanoma . 'Unresectable ' melanoma mean melanoma tumor body big close important part body ( like big blood vessel ) cut safely . We study use drug shrink tumor make small enough cut ; call `` neoadjuvant '' approach treat melanoma . By remove cancer body use combination drug surgery , think could help people live longer . Pembrolizumab drug give vein make immune system strong fight cancer cell . Pembrolizumab class drug call immunotherapy . Immunotherapy use part person 's immune system fight disease . Pembrolizumab design restore natural ability immune system recognize target melanoma cell attack . In addition possibly shrink tumor , may change immune system fight melanoma future . We also try learn pembrolizumab work body . In study , look skin , blood , bone marrow see see sign tell doctor whether pembrolizumab work tell u patient may work .</detailed_description>
