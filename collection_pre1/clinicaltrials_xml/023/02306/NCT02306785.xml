	<brief_summary>This Phase I , open-label , single-site trial evaluate drug release , use scintigraphic image mesalazine plasma level ( PK ) healthy subject patient mildly active UC . Overall , nine [ 9 ] subject per prototype coating ( total 18 ) evaluate . Four [ 4 ] healthy subject five [ 5 ] patient administer one [ 1 ] radio-labelled tablet either formulation D formulation E , respectively . Amendment : Overall , nine [ 9 ] subjects/patients evaluate . Four [ 4 ] healthy subject five [ 5 ] patient administer one [ 1 ] radio-labelled tablet new third improve formulation H. In order keep number patient low , recruitment patient stop obtain least 3 patient evaluable scintigraphic image . Healthy volunteer recruit achieve full set participant ( n=9 per Arm ) .</brief_summary>
