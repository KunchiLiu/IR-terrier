	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation common arrythmia . It independent risk factor stroke . There anticoagulation therapy use atrial fibrillation patient . Alternatively , leave atrial appendix closure use , risk bleed complication deem great possible antithrombotic benefit anticoagulation medication . Up 70 % ischemic complication prevent anticoagulation therapy , leave atrial appendix closure seem comparable result . Also leave atrial catherter ablation ( LACA ) gain popularity therapeutic intervention atrial fibrillation . However , procedure associate 0,5-1 % perioperative risk clinically evident transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) stroke . While incidence clinically evident ischemic complication remain relatively low , recent data suggest 13 % -20 % patient undergoing LACA affect post-operative neurocognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) 90 day ablation . The goal study improve detection subtle brain dysfunction cardiac intervention employ experimental executive reaction time ( RT ) test along EEG record aim improve objective detection subtle brain dysfunction assume underlie persistent cognitive , somatic , affective complaint report patient undergone atrial fibrillation ablation .</brief_summary>
