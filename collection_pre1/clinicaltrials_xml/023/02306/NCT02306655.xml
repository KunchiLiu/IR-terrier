	<brief_summary>Fundamentals scientific research The `` coital incontinence '' ( IC ) , define `` involuntary loss urine association sexual intercourse . '' The incidence report literature range 10 % 27 % , likely underestimated embarrassment woman report disturbance . It fact estimate 3 % woman speak spontaneously doctor , increase 20 % request medical staff . The CI traditionally divide two form : 1. incontinence time penetration ( 60 % case ) 2. incontinence orgasm ( 40 % case ) Many theory propose justify form urinary incontinence , none conclusively prove .Moreover , possible , date , identify risk factor , anatomical urodynamics , condition . The IC rarely symptom isolate , frequently associate form urinary incontinence . In particular , IC penetration associate stress urinary incontinence ( loss urine occur due coughing , sneeze general activity increase abdominal pressure ) ; IC orgasm associate frequently condition overactive bladder ( presence urgency , urge incontinence , increased urination day night ) . The IC strong impact female sexuality cause loss libido , non orgasmic , decreased sexual satisfaction , case , termination sexual activity . Research goal Evaluate prospective investigation health statistic , incidence coital incontinence consideration data literature disorder report wide variance probably connect data collection . The aim able identify `` threatening condition '' , evaluate , worsen prognosis treatment female urinary incontinence , condition negative impact quality life patient significantly worse related recognize debilitate chronic disease diabetes . And individual psychosocial cost , hardly quantifiable , must add cost significant socio-economic welfare dependent incontinent patient , community national health service . It indeed evident international national literature incisive determine strategy information , awareness education , adopt much wider earlier diagnosis , significant socio-economic saving , well psycho social , get . Ultimate goal differentiate two form incontinence coital ( penetration orgasm ) associate pathogenesis therefore separate treatment . And form IC penetration favorably affect treatment stress urinary incontinence , form IC orgasm , usually associate functional disorder detrusor ( detrusor overactivity ) show inferior efficacy treatment antimuscarinic traditionally reserve condition overactive bladder therefore need target diagnostic individualized treatment . Materials method Self administer questionnaire dispense patient The questionnaire , validate Italian language , use , accord guideline International Consultation Incontinence , : - ICIQ-UI urinary incontinence short-form : evaluation symptom quality life : - Patient Perception Bladder Condition ( PPBC ) : assess impact subjective condition ; - Urinary incontinence quality sexuality ; - Urinary incontinence frequency sexual activity ; The questionnaire anonymous order protect privacy . The patient recruit outpatient surgery Urogynaecology urodynamics Urology Clinic University Perugia . The investigator define statistically significant number subject less 200 unit . The time duration collection medical record estimate two year . There extremes conflict interest , test use drug medical equipment .</brief_summary>
