	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study ProMetic Plasminogen ( Human ) Intravenous Adults Children With Plasminogen Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Phase 1 study single center study , subject across country . It open-label , single-arm , dose-escalation study patient hypoplasminogenemia age 12 year old . Three dose cohort plan achieve target sample size 12 evaluable subject . This ensure minimum 4 evaluable subject cohort . Due challenge patient availability burden cross country travel , cohort enroll 6 subject . Any subject may participate multiple cohort , judge appropriate investigator . In cohort , subject must diagnose hypoplasminogenimia plasminogen activity level ≤ 40 % administer single dose Plasminogen ( Human ) , investigational medicinal product . Plasminogen administer intravenous ( IV ) infusion follow dos : - Cohort 1 : 2 mg/kg - Cohort 2 : 6 mg/kg - Cohort 3* : 12 mg/kg * Optional . If optimal dose information demonstrate either Cohort 1 2 , Cohort 3 pursue . At dose level , Plasma plasminogen activity antigen level measure develop pharmacokinetic profile . Blood sample draw follow time point : baseline immediately dose ; end infusion ; 1 , 6 , 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 , 120 , 168 , 216 hour end infusion . Visits 1-4 11 must conduct clinical site . A subject may conduct Visits 5-10 clinical site study procedure perform Home Health Nurses Group ( HHNG ) nurse home visit , continue visit study site possible practical . Subjects another visit 14 day IV infusion Visit 10 ( Day 15 , Short-term-Safety Visit ) . Subjects return clinic 30 day IV infusion Visit 11 ( Day 30 , Follow-up-Safety Visit ) collection adverse event ( AEs ) , immunogenicity testing , routine safety test procedure , final viral safety testing , unless subject enter another Cohort .</detailed_description>
