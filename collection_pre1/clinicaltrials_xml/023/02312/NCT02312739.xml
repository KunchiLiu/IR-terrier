	<brief_summary>This randomize , double blind study aim measure difference maximum pain experience in-office transcervical sterilization ( Essure® ) woman receive either inhaled nitrous oxide standard oral analgesia ( Vicodin Lorazepam ) inhale oxygen .

	<brief_title>Nitrous Oxide Pain Management During In-office Transcervical Sterilization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hysteroscopic permanent sterilization Essure® increasingly perform outpatient setting . No optimal outpatient analgesia regimen identify Essure® procedure . The investigator propose study inhale nitrous oxide administer oxygen , hereafter refer nitrous oxide ( NO ) , intervention lower pain experience in-office procedure . The investigator hypothesize , compare standard oral medication , inhale NO decrease patient anxiety associate in-office procedure , well increase patient satisfaction provider perceive ease device insertion . Women present clinic family plan receive standard counseling form contraception , include short long act reversible contraception , method permanent sterilization . Once patient decides sterilization procedure transcervical approach ( Essure® procedure ) , undergo standard pre-procedure evaluation , include complete history , appropriate physical examination include pelvic examination , urine pregnancy test . Eligible woman interested sterilization advise study investigation evaluate nitrous oxide alternative current oral sedation pain management in-office procedure . If choose hysteroscopic sterilization , undergo inform consent Essure® procedure . Providers assess patient eligibility criterion possible enrollment study . If patient eligible choose participate research study , consent participation obtain . At time patient randomized treatment group base predetermine randomization scheme . For research study compare use NO versus oral pain medication , NO group receive two placebo pill standard group receive one 5/325 mg oral tablet Vicodin one 1 mg oral tablet lorazepam 30 minute prior procedure . The standard care group receive oxygen ( instead NO ) procedure . All participant receive 30 mg intramuscular ketorolac 30 minute prior procedure . NO oxygen administer via scent nasal mask blind patient intervention . NO titrated concentration 70 % nitrous oxide 30 % oxygen base desire analgesic effect per predetermine sedation scale part University New Mexico Center Reproductive Health ( UNM CRH ) nitrous administration protocol . All patient monitor pulse-oximeter . The patient fit mask procedure ready begin . A single nurse administer nitrous oxide oxygen procedure . Every study patient receive minimum 3 minute oxygen end procedure minimize side effect NO . Additional oxygen administer need patient experience residual effect NO . Prior procedure study medication , patient complete patient information demographic questionnaire receive instruction 0-100mm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) . A baseline pain score record use 0-100mm VAS anchor 0 equal pain 100 equal worst pain imaginable , well baseline anxiety level use STAI . At placement paracervical block deployment second device coil , pain assess 0-100mm VAS . At 3 5 minute follow completion procedure , maximal pain experience transcervical sterilization assess patient . Prior discharge clinic , patient rate pain level use 0-100mm VAS , rate level anxiety procedure use STAI , rate overall satisfaction procedure measure use 5-point Likert scale . Immediately procedure , physician complete 0-100mm VAS ease insertion sterilization device anchor 0 equal difficulty 100 equal difficult . The physician also complete 0-100mm VAS hysteroscopic procedure difficulty anchor 0 equal difficulty 100 equal difficult . The standard transcervical sterilization procedure evaluate study . After patient complete procedure , contact approximately 75 day procedure date schedule confirmatory test , hysterosalpingogram , require 90 day demonstrate successful sterilization .</detailed_description>
