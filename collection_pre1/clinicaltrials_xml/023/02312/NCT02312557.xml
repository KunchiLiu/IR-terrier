	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With Enzalutamide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Measure anti-cancer activity pembrolizumab men metastatic , castration resistant prostate cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate immunological parameter evaluate possible marker functional change predictive clinical response . II . To collect circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) determine degree tumor characteristic share CTCs . III . Changes T cell number , activation , phenotype measure whole blood diagnosis throughout therapy . IV . Systemic inflammatory marker : serum interleukin ( IL ) -8 , IL-6 , IL-1 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) transform growth factor ( TGF ) -beta . V. Objective disease response radiograph . VI . Prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) progression free survival . VII . Overall survival . OUTLINE : INITIAL TREATMENT PHASE : Patients progress enzalutamide receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients continue receive standard care enzalutamide orally ( PO ) daily . MONITORING PHASE : After completion initial treatment phase , patient continue receive standard care enzalutamide PO daily duration trial . RETREATMENT PHASE : Patients disease response stability initial treatment phase receive pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week additional 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients continue receive standard care enzalutamide PO daily duration trial . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 12 week 2.5 year .</detailed_description>
