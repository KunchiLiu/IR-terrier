	<brief_title>Delayed Renal Allograft Function Furosemide Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background/ Rationale Kidney Transplantation lifesaving modality patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , number transplant skyrocket since first successful trial . In 2013 alone , 18,000 kidney transplant do United States America . Of , 11,161 decease donor ( NKUDIC 2011 , One Legacy 2014 , USRDS 2013 ) . One common complication renal transplant Delayed Graft Function ( DGF ) . DGF serious complication , best define need renal replacement therapy , dialysis , within first week renal transplant ( Mallon et al . 2013 ) . DGF greatly increase risk acute chronic transplant rejection , decrease patient survival quality life , patient survive ( Perico et al . 2004 , Weber et al . 2014 ) . Additionally , rate DGF high patient receive deceased donor transplant ( One Legacy 2014 ) . Therefore , crucial well-being large population reduce incidence DGF . Our approach investigate current treatment modality patient post-deceased donor renal transplant , understand best prevent DGF even start . Currently , administration loop diuretic furosemide common practice order prevent treat oliguria renal transplant patient . However , animal model able show benefit treat acute kidney injury ( AKI ) , occur transplant kidney due cold ischemia time , furosemide . There lack evidence furosemide use lead improved patient outcomes patient AKI ( Nadeau-Fredette et al . 2013 ) . Given side effect furosemide administration include ototoxicity , hypotension , electrolyte abnormality , hypersensitivity reaction , investigator hypothesize , may significantly reduce incidence DGF placebo , important investigate benefit furosemide administration truly outweigh harm ( Strom et al . 2003 ) . The investigator intend achieve way randomize , double-blinded , pilot clinical trial adult oliguric patient , post-deceased donor renal transplant . 2 . Objectives I.Primary Objective : i.To test hypothesis DGF rate adult oliguric post-deceased donor renal transplant patient administer furosemide vs. placebo . II.Secondary Objectives : i.To compare follow within two treatment group : - 30-day , 90-day 12-month creatinine level estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) - The need RRT ( Hemodialysis Peritoneal dialysis ) 30 day , 90 day 12 month post-transplant - The time transplant DGF development - The incidence DGF - The incidence primary graft non-function - Overall hospital length stay - The KDPI score relation primary graft non-function ii . To quantify association furosemide administration relevant patient center outcome , hospital length stay acquire complication , order decrease patient morbidity mortality . c. Study Outline All patient admit deceased donor kidney transplant see Nephrology service pre-transplant evaluation . The Nephrology Fellow/Attending physician go checklist determines patient eligible study obtain informed consent patient eligible . Informed consent obtain eligible patient . All eligible patient ' urine output monitor soon return unit operate room . If patient remain oliguric anuric 6 hour , bedside nurse alert on-call study coordinator randomization enrollment per protocol . Study Intervention Patients assign furosemide infusion group receive furosemide infusion , outline figure 2 . This adapted Ostermann et al . ( 2007 ) SPARK study protocol ( Bagshaw et al . 2010 ) . Furosemide prepare bag contain 1000 mg furosemide per 250 mL saline reach concentration 4 mg/mL . All medication placebo bag identifier show type drug administer , blind purpose . Medication placebo bag randomly generate study identifier number . The protocol figure 2 follow achieve total urine output 1mL/kg/h . The furosemide infusion rate exceed 4mg/min IV maximum set manufacturer .</detailed_description>
