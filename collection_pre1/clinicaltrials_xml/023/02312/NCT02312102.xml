	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate drug call bortezomib lenalidomide possible treatment myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . The purpose research study determine safety efficacy bortezomib lenalidomide investigational combination . This drug combination use treatment relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma previously investigate treatment MDS AML , albeit low dose lenalidomide . In research study , investigator look high dose combination give safely see well work combination MDS AML individual whose disease relapse SCT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Velcade Lenalidomide Patients With Relapsed AML MDS After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- After screen procedure confirm participation research study : - The participant give study drug-dosing calendar treatment cycle . The investigator look high dose combination study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose give depend number participant enrol study prior well dose tolerate . - Dose escalation occur use standard 3+3 dose escalation approach , begin dose level I dose cohort rule escalation de-escalation . - Each treatment cycle last 28 day ( 4 week ) . The first two cycle call induction cycle . If participant respond treatment first two cycle , continue maintenance cycle . - Lenalidomide - Bortezomib :</detailed_description>
