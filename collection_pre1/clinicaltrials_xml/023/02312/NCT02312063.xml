	<brief_title>Dietary Impacts Glucose-lowering Effects Sitagliptin Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>&lt; Background Rationale &gt; DPP-4 inhibitor ( DPP-4i ) become 1st line oral anti-diabetic drug ( OAD ) management type 2 diabetes Japan ; approximately 3-million patient , one third diagnosis diabetes , receive DPP-4i . The widespread use DPP-4i Japan partly due accumulate data clinical trial demonstrate DPP-4 inhibitor exert great HbA1c-lowering effect Japanese type 2 diabetes patient also non-obese Asian type 2 diabetes patient compare diabetes patient ethnicity ( Ann Pharmacother 2012 ; 46:1453-69 ; Diabetologia 2013 ; 56:696-708 ) . We previously demonstrate source diet fish enhance HbA1c-lowering effect DPP-4i ( J Diabet Investig 2012:3 ( 5 ) :464-467 ) . In retrospective study , also report DPP-4i treatment effective type 2 diabetic patient high plasma level EPA DHA , polyunsaturated fatty acid rich fish ( J Diabet Investig 2012:3 ( 5 ) :464-467 ; J Diabet Investig 2012:3 ( 6 ) :498-502 ) . In course analyze mechanism , find ingestion fish prior rice enhance secretion GLP-1 ( Yabe D et al . Late breaking poster presentation ADA 2014 , manuscript preparation ) . Further investigation ideal dietary content combination DPP-4i could helpful enhance DPP-4i efficacy patient . This prospective clinical trial study food composition addition compliance diet therapy Japanese patient receive sitagliptin active comparator glimepiride provide new insight cross-talk diet medicine &lt; Study Procedures &gt; 1 . Initial screening period IC , screen assessment , eligibility check except inclusion criterion ( visit 1-4 week ) . 1 . Hospital visit fasting . 2 . Patient 's informed consent The investigator hand write information patient give explanation content study . The patient provide ample time opportunity inquire detail study , confirmation patient fully understood content study , inform consent form participation study sign . ( The inform consent form describe explanatory consideration specify Ethical Guidelines Clinical Studies , Part IV : Informed consent &lt; detailed rule &gt; ) Prior patient 's participation study , write informed consent form sign place name/seal , personally dated investigator patient . When CRC perform supplemental explanation , he/she also sign place name/seal , date inform consent form . The investigator distribute copy sign informed consent form write information patient . After acquisition inform consent participation study end final observation , information becomes available may relevant patient 's willingness continue participation study , patient inform timely manner confirm whether patient still willing participate study . This communication record writing . At time , investigator considers write information revise , write information promptly revise . The patient may withdraw study time . If patient withdrawn consent , investigator record reason withdrawal CRF . 3 . Make interim registration patient . A unique number ( screen baseline number ) assign identification purpose . It note circumstance patient assign one allocation number 4 . Check patient satisfies require eligibility . Inquire background patient , past medical history , history surgery , prior treatment drug , perform physical exam , vital sign ( incl . ECG ) , hematology , blood biochemistry , pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) , HbA1c , fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) well plasma EPA/DHA , FFQ metabolomics . 5 . Washout period Visit 2 show : - Patients treated oral anti-diabetic agent : None - Patients single oral anti-diabetic agent : 4 week 2 . Baseline period Physical laboratory checkup , randomization initiation treatment ( visit2 , 0 week ) . 1 . Hospital admission patient fast . 2 . In accordance study schedule , perform physical exam , vital sign ( incl . ECG ) pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) determine . Concomitant drug check . 3 . Confirm abnormal finding , randomize patient [ Randomization procedure ] 1 ) The following requirement send secretariat study : Patient identification code Satisfying eligibility criterion Assignments perform dynamic allocation follow factor : Gender Age BMI Plasma EPA 4 . When person charge registration assess entry patient appropriate , study drug administer designate . 5 . Initiate study drug follow dos ( visit 2-4 , 0-16 week ) : Sitagliptin 50mg Glimepiride 0.5mg 3 . Treatment period Physical laboratory checkup ( visit3 , 8 week ; visit4 , 16 week ) . 1 . Hospital admission patient fast . 2 . Check treatment compliance status , presence absence adverse event/hypoglycemic symptom ( glimepiride treatment group ) . 3 . In accordance study schedule , perform physical exam , vital sign ( incl . ECG ) pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) determine . Concomitant drug check . HbA1c , fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) well plasma EPA/DHA , FFQ metabolomics also check . 3-1 . Study configuration ( parallel , crossover , etc . ) , Multicenter , randomize , prospective , open-label , 2 arm parallel , clinical trial . ( 2 center , see appendix ) 3-2 . Duration treatment period 16 week 3-3 . Control group Glimepiride 3-4 . Follow-up procedure A patient withdrawn trial 1 . The patient withdraw consent , without need justify decision . 2 . The patient take concomitant drug interfere study medication . 3 . The patient longer able participate study medical reason ( e.g. , surgery , AEs , diseases ) . 4 . Occurrence unacceptable hyperglycemia hypoglycemia may put patient risk continue participation . 5 . The patient able comply study protocol ( accord discretion investigator sub-investigator ) . &lt; Statistical Analysis Sample Size Justification &gt; To evaluate association change HbA1c level baseline plasma DHA/EPA , linear regression analysis carry week16 treatment group . We construct multivariable logistic regression model ass whether plasma DHA/EPA independently associate HbA1c reduction . We calculate Spearman correlation coefficient change HbA1c follow variable : compliance diet therapy , estimate intake various food item include fish , clinical characteristic patient ( age , sex , body mass index , duration diabetes , baseline HbA1c ) use IBM SPSS Statistics 22 ( SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC , USA ) . Sample size : In retrospective analysis , estimate intake fish DHA/EPA ( n=72 ) well serum level DHA/EPA ( n=20 ) significantly correlate HbA1c reduction DPP-4 inhibitor drug-naïve T2DM patient ( J Diabet Investig 2012:3 ( 5 ) :464-7 ) . In another retrospective analysis , serum level EPA significantly correlate HbA1c reduction DPP-4 inhibitor T2DM patient receive DPP-4 inhibitor monotherapy ( n=16 ) add-on therapy ( n=46 ) ( J Diabet Investig 2012 : 3 ( 6 ) :498-502 ) .These study support propose study require sample size 24 patient treatment group consider drop out . &lt; Specific Drug Supply Requirements &gt; Both sitagliptin glimepiride prescribe accord national health insurance . The patient eligible study randomize treatment sitagliptin glimepiride 0 week . Patients receive OAD enrollment subject washout prior randomization 0 week . The dose treatment group follow : Sitagliptin : Orally , 50mg/day ( q.d ) throughout treatment period Glimepiride : Orally , 0.5mg/day ( q.d ) throughout treatment period &lt; Adverse Experience Reporting &gt; An adverse event ( AE ) unfavourable unintended sign ( include abnormal laboratory finding , example ) , symptom , disease temporally associate use medicinal product , whether consider related medicinal product . AEs report sponsor procedure similar market product .</detailed_description>
