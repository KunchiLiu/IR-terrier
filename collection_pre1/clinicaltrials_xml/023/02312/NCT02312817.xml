	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) 9th lead cause cancer-related death US one lead cause death patient cirrhosis . Fewer 1 5 high-risk patient undergo HCC screening , low rate non-Caucasian low socioeconomic status patient receive care safety-net health system . Screening follow-up failure lead advanced cancer , curative therapy available survival significantly bad . Over 60 % HCC diagnose advanced stage , due poor recognition high-risk patient , underuse screen among patient , poor follow-up abnormal screening test . To address barrier , investigator propose conduct comparative effectiveness research randomize control trial three screen strategy among socioeconomically disadvantage racially diverse cohort cirrhotic patient high risk develop HCC . Overall , 1800 patient attend Parkland , Dallas safety-net health system , randomize : - Group 1 : Usual care , visit-based HCC screen per discretion individual provider - Group 2 : Mailed HCC screen invitation outreach eligible patient ( low resource intensity ) - Group 3 : Mailed HCC screen invitation outreach eligible patient combine centralized patient navigation promote screen completion follow-up ( high resource intensity ) Through three specific aim , effectiveness research randomize control trial : - Aim 1 : Engage stakeholder design implementation HCC screen outreach intervention . - Aim 2 : Compare clinical effectiveness patient acceptability intervention strategy increase completion one-time repeat HCC screening . - Aim 3 : Evaluate whether intervention effect moderate patient sex , race , ethnicity , English proficiency , connectedness primary care . The screen intervention strategy combine EMR-enabled case identification , system-level screening outreach , patient navigation improve identification previously unrecognized cirrhotic patient , promote HCC screen completion , facilitate follow-up abnormal screening test . This study engage stakeholder throughout research process , evaluate effectiveness acceptability HCC screening strategy , determine patient subgroup benefit .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>As risk HCC significant cirrhosis regardless age , gender , race , include adult patient cirrhosis age ( &gt; 21 year old ) , sex , races/ethnicities speak English Spanish . Our study leverage Parkland 's electronic medical record ( EMR ) use novel EMRenabled casefinding algorithm identify patient know cirrhosis , use ICD9 code , well unrecognized suspect cirrhosis , use set laboratory data . Patients ICD9 code cirrhosis cirrhosis complication eligible study enrollment meet follow criterion : One encounter ICD9 cod 456.0 , 456.1 , 456.2 , 456.21 , 567.23 , 572.2 , 572.3 , 572.4 ; OR , Two encounter ICD9 cod 571.2 and/or 571.5 ; OR , One encounter ICD9 cod 571.2 571.5 Parkland primary care clinic , GI , woman 's health center . Patients AST platelet ratio index ( APRI ) &gt; 1.5 combination platelet count &lt; 300 , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; 1,000 study enrollment eligible . We exclude patient know HCC suspicious appear mass image within six month prior ascertainment eligibility , patient require diagnostic test instead routine screening . We exclude patient Child Pugh class C cirrhosis significant comorbid condition life expectancy le one year , ( e.g. , extrahepatic malignancy ) HCC screen recommend subgroups patient . Parkland patient ≥ 21 year age Diagnosis cirrhosis meet criteria suspect cirrhosis ≥ 1 outpatient visit 12 month prior randomization Contact information file English Spanish speak HCC suspicious mass image Any malignancy except malignant neoplasm skin Metastatic solid tumor Palliative care referral Liver transplant Child Pugh C</criteria>
