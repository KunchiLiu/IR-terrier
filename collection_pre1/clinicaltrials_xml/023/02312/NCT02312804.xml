	<criteria>Male female subject age &gt; 18 year time inform consent Histologically/cytologically confirm locally advanced metastatic solid tumor curable therapy exists . In dose expansion part study , patient stage IV recurrent/persistent cervical cancer enrol . Confirmation FGF/FGFR aberration require . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 2 Adequate marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10 9/L platelet ≥ 100,000 x 10 9/L hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Adequate liver function evidence bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; alanine aminotransferase ( AL T ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; 3 time ULN Evidence measurable evaluable disease , determine RECIST v 1.1 Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 90 day follow completion therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A female childbearing potential woman ( regardless sexual orientation , undergone tubal ligation , remain celibate choice ) meet follow criterion : undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy , naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( Le. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) . Oral contraceptive ( OC ) , inject implanted hormonal method allow sole method contraception BGJ398 characterize respect potential interfere PK and/or effectiveness OCs . It prefer archival tumor sample available molecular testing , available , newly obtain tumor biopsy may submit instead ( mandatory ) For patient enrol dose escalation , number prior treatment allow . For patient enrol dose expansion , prior chemotherapy allow ( previous single agent cisplatin concurrent radiotherapy accept ) . No prior therapy paclitaxel , BGJ398 FGFR target agent . Preexisting &gt; grade 2 peripheral neuropathy Patients brain metastasis allow provide clinically stable period 30 day prior study entry requirement steroid anti epileptic . History pancreatitis last 6 month prior enrollment . History and/or current evidence endocrine alteration calcium/phosphate homeostasis , e.g. , parathyroid disorder , history parathyroidectomy , tumor lysis , tumoral calcinosis , patient phosphate regulate abnormality . Because hyperphosphatemia frequent occurrence BGJ398 treatment , pretreatment concurrent treatment phosphate regulating agent allow . Current evidence corneal retinal disorder/ keratopathy bullous/ band keratopathy , corneal abrasion , inflammation/ulceration , keratoconjunctivits , etc Since BGJ398 likely inhibitor CYP3A4 , patient currently receive treatment agent know sting inducer inhibitor CYP3A4 allow Treatment follow anticancer therapy prior first dose BGJ398 within state timeframes : intravenous chemotherapy within period 4 week ( 6 week nitrosourea , mitomycinC ) , biological therapy ( e , g . antibody ) within period time ~ 5 t1/2 less 4 week , whichever short , prior start study drug , investigational agent within period time &lt; 5 tl/2 4 week ( whichever shortest ) prior start study drug , wide field radiotherapy &lt; 4 week limited field radiation palliation &lt; 2 week prior start study drug . Use medication increase serum level phosphorus and/or calcium . History cardiac disease ( Congestive heart failure NYHA grade &gt; 2 , LVEF &lt; 50 % determine MUGA scan ECHO , history clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia , unstable angina pectoriS acute myocardial infarction &lt; 6 month prior start study drug , QTcF &gt; 450 msec ) Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman .</criteria>
