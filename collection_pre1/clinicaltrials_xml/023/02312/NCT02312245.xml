	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well Avatar-directed chemotherapy work treat patient ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer respond platinum anti-cancer drug . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , gemcitabine hydrochloride , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride , topotecan hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Using Avatar , live tumor sample similar genetic characteristic original tumor , may help determine chemotherapy effective .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate Avatar-directed salvage chemotherapy patient platinum-resistant ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival patient platinum-resistant ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer receive Avatar-directed salvage chemotherapy . II . To determine overall survival patient platinum-resistant ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer receive Avatar-directed salvage chemotherapy . III . To determine adverse event patient platinum-resistant ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer receive Avatar-directed salvage chemotherapy . IV . To determine correlation patient response response Avatar . V. To enrich Avatar response signature response Avatar-directed therapy use patient outcome . VI . To compare response rate patient receive bevacizumab treatment . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 4 treatment arm direct Avatar result . ARM A : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1-96 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients may also receive bevacizumab IV 90 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity ARM B : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM C : Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 60 minute day 1 . Patients may also receive bevacizumab IV 90 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM D : Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1-5 every 21 day day 1 , 8 , 15 every 28 day . Patients may also receive bevacizumab IV 90 minute day 1 every 21 day day 1 15 every 28 day . Courses repeat every 21 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
