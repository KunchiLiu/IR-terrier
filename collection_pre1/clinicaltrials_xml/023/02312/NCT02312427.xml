	<brief_summary>We think investigate influence DPP-4 inhibitor serum BNP level diabetic patient congestive heart failure . This study consist two protocol . In first protocol , diabetic patient high level serum BNP ( 100-2000 pg/ml ) receive outpatient treatment type DPP-4 inhibitor institution enrol . After baseline data collection , DPP-4 inhibitor suspend one month serum BNP measure . The DPP-4 inhibitor resume another month , serum BNP measure . In protocol , diabetic patient hospitalize due heart failure enrol . DPP-4 inhibitor start stabilization heart failure , serum BNP measure drug administration .</brief_summary>
