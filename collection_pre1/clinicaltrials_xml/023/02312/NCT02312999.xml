	<brief_title>Crystalloids Colloids Goal-directed Fluid Therapy With Closed-loop Assistance Major Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Controversy still persist regard type fluid use operate room avoid hypovolemia circulatory insufficiency . While crystalloids colloid solution frequently use optimize intravascular volume surgery , crystalloid solution require volume hemodynamic optimization may result high volume fluid administration potentially side effect . Compared crystalloids , colloid advantage remain intravascular space longer , achieve faster circulatory stabilization , maintain colloid osmotic pressure increase micro perfusion . However , colloid expensive may various side effect . In addition effect crystalloids colloid patient , amount fluid administer also debate . Goal-directed fluid therapy ( GDFT ) strategy base cardiac output ( CO ) optimization show benefit moderate- high-risk surgery patient recently recommend professional society UK , France , Europe . However , despite grow evidence , strategy often implement current practice . One reason lack implementation GDFT strategy , like complex clinical protocol , require significant provider attention vigilance consistent implementation well know even study condition protocol compliance rate often great 50 % In another hand , one chief complicate factor fluid administration study variation provider administration practice , even attempt follow protocol . Previous study use closed-loop ( automate ) system deliver fluid standardize protocol , remove variation provider one confounders study . Dr. Cannesson Rinehart ( UC Irvine , California , USA ) recently develop use closed-loop system provision GDFT clinical study UC Irvine La Pitie hospital France . The closed-loop system beneficial involve standardization fluid management patient treat equivalently . This system thus provide consistent GDFT case protocol remove inter-provider variability confounder group . Study goal : This study examine whether significant difference postoperative outcome GDFT use colloid solution versus crystalloid solution . Hypothesis : Perioperative fluid optimization use closed-loop assistance balance starch solution ( volulyte速 ) associate decrease postoperative complication compare approach use balance crystalloid solution ( Plasmalyte速 ) . Objective : To establish kind intravenous fluid use goal direct therapy closed-loop assistance reduce number postoperative complication ( evaluation make POMS score ) .</detailed_description>
