	<brief_title>A Study Oral Ixazomib Maintenance Therapy Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Not Treated With Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call ixazomib citrate . Ixazomib citrate test slow disease progression improve overall survival people newly diagnose multiple myeloma ( NDMM ) major positive response initial therapy undergone stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) . This study look effect ixazomib citrate length time participant free disease progression overall survival . The study enroll approximately 761 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Ixazomib citrate 3 mg - Placebo ( dummy inactive pill ) - capsule look like study drug active ingredient All participants ask take one capsule Days 1 , 8 15 28-day cycle , 26 cycle . This multi-center trial conduct worldwide . The overall time participate study 24 month . Participants make 28 visit clinic treatment period continue make follow-up visit every 4 week next line therapy begin . Participants also contact telephone every 12 week last treatment visit follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
