	<brief_summary>A phase 2b , placebo-controlled , randomize , double-blind , multi-center study GCS-100 patient chronic kidney disease cause diabetes . The study enroll approximately 375 patient multiple center locate United States . Study duration 6 month . Patients randomly assign 1:1:1:1 treatment placebo ( 0.9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP ) , 1 mg , 3 mg , 9 mg GCS-100 . All dos study drug administer via intravenous ( IV ) push injection weekly 2 month ( 8 week ) , every week additional 4 month ( 16 week ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2b Study GCS-100 Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease Caused Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Galectin-3 contributes fibrosis , elevate patient ESRD , correlate adverse outcome ( de Boer et . al. , 2011 , Dang et . al. , 2012 , Fernandes Bertocchi et . al. , 2008 , Henderson et . al. , 2008 ) . Animal model genetic knockout galectin-3 demonstrate reduction structural functional deficit kidney ( Dang et . al. , 2012 , Fernandes Bertocchi et . al. , 2008 , Henderson et . al. , 2008 ) . GCS-100 galectin- 3 antagonist show reduce fibrosis pre-clinically . Based role galectin-3 fibrosis kidney disease , Sponsor believe GCS-100 may effective treat patient CKD cause diabetes .</detailed_description>
