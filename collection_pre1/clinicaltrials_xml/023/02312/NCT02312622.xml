	<brief_title>Phase II Etirinotecan Pegol Refractory Brain Metastases &amp; Advanced Lung Cancer / Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : For cohort A Cohort C , determine CNS disease control rate ( number patient stable disease partial response complete response / total number treat patient ) 12 week follow treatment etirinotecan pegol patient advance NSCLC MBC refractory brain metastasis Secondary Objectives : Cohorts A C : - To measure overall disease control rate response rate patient receive study therapy - To measure systemic ( non CNS ) disease control rate response rate patient receive study therapy - To observe progression free survival study population - To observe overall survival study population Cohort B : - To observe CNS systemic disease control SCLC Cohorts A , B C : - To determine safety profile etirinotecan pegol ( NKTR 102 )</detailed_description>
