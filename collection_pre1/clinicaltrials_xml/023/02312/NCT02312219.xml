	<detailed_description>HIV infection associate substantially increase risk CVD fully account traditional risk factor . Several line evidence suggest chronic immune cell activation may complicit . In support concept , recently use 18F-FDG-PET/CT demonstrate HIV-infected individual increase arterial inflammation compare non-HIV , FRS-matched control degree arterial inflammation relate marker monocyte activation . Further , others show increased arterial FDG uptake predict future CVD event non-HIV cohort . Together , observation support concept target arterial inflammation may provide benefit HIV infected individual . The NHLBI recently provide funding clinical trial target excess inflammation HIV . The `` Parent Study '' perform collaboration National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) AIDS Clinical Trials Group NHLBI . That randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial ass whether 24-week treatment low-dose methotrexate ( LDMTX ) : ) safe , ii ) reduce level circulate inflammatory biomarkers activate immune cell iii ) improve brachial artery reactivity ( BART ) . However , neither biomarkers BART study measure part Parent Study report atherosclerotic inflammation , ( desired pathobiological target LDMTX therapy HIV ) . As , direct evaluation arterial inflammation would substantially enhance scientific value Parent Study . Atherosclerotic inflammation non-invasively reproducibly measure FDG-PET/CT imaging , well-validated quantitative technique sensitively detect change atherosclerotic inflammation . FDG-PET/CT image employed several multi-center trial measure change arterial inflammation response anti-inflammatory treatment . Accordingly , propose time sensitive ancillary imaging study determine treat virologically suppress , HIV-infected individual LDMTX reduce atherosclerotic inflammation , assess FDG-PET/CT . Our central hypothesis persistent immune cell activation result chronic arterial inflammation , subsequently contribute CVD risk observe HIV . This fully integrated ancillary study would , subset patient enrolled parent trial : ( ) ass impact LDMTX arterial inflammation , ( ii ) identify immune cell subtypes whose change ( LDMTX ) associate change arterial inflammation . Accordingly , propose ancillary study would provide unique highly complementary information would greatly increase knowledge mechanistic insight gain Parent Study . The ancillary study two specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : To determine impact anti-inflammatory treatment LDMTX arterial inflammation , assess FDG-PET/CT imaging , virally suppress HIV-infected individual . Knowledge Gap/Need : The parent study provide assessment target pathology ( arterial inflammation ) hence insight regard effect LDMTX treatment arterial inflammation need . Hypothesis 1 : LDMTX therapy reduce arterial inflammation ( great extent placebo ) . To test hypothesis 1 : We determine 91 patient ( subset parent study ) arterial inflammation ( measure PET/CT 0 24 week ) reduce LDMTX ( relative placebo ) . Specific Aim 2 : To evaluate cellular biochemical mediator associate arterial inflammation HIV explore potential mechanism effect LDMTX therapy arterial inflammation HIV . Knowledge Gap/Need : The parent study , , provide tool directly evaluate arterial inflammation HIV . Evaluation relationship circulate inflammatory mediator arterial inflammation context study would yeild mechanistic insight regard atherosclerotic disease HIV provide great understanding effect LDMTX arterial inflammation HIV . Hypothesis 2.1 : At baseline , arterial inflammation closely associated measure activate immune cell ( CD14+/CD16+ monocytes ) . Additional relationship might see arterial inflammation cellular subset ( e.g . T-cells ) , inflammatory cytokine , endothelial function . Hypothesis 2.2 : Post-treatment change arterial inflammation positively correlate change measure activate immune cell ( especially activate monocyte ) . To test hypothesis : We evaluate arterial inflammation ( PET ) correlate inflammatory cell activation measure biomarkers separately . We compare strength association test independence . The evaluation association perform : comparing baseline measurement ( SA 2.1 ) , compare post-randomization change ( SA2.2 ) . We expect LDMTX therapy improve arterial inflammation mechanistic , proof-of-concept study demonstrate importance inflammation immune activation HIV . This would thus form basis event-driven trial evaluate whether anti-inflammatory strategy reduce CVD risk individual treat HIV infection . Accordingly , study potential shift paradigm approach treat atherosclerosis HIV-infected individual , potentially population well .</detailed_description>
