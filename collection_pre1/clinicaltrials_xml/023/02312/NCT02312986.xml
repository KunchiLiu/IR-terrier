	<brief_summary>This propose protocol involve use fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) suppress reverse colonization multidrug resistant organism ( MDRO ) subject recurrent MDRO infection due organism likely enteric origin . FMT perform subject history least three recurrent infection due MDRO ; least two recurrent , severe infection due MDRO require hospitalization ; least two recurrent infection due MDRO antimicrobial rate limit toxicity available . The objective protocol determine fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) able prevent additional recurrence infection due MDRO suppress reverse enteric colonization MDRO .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective pilot study fecal microbiota transplantation patient history recurrent MDRO infection . Subjects meet inclusion/exclusion criterion provide write , informed consent provide pre-FMT stool sample . The FMT administer enema outpatient setting trained personnel . Patients provide stool sample 30 day , 6 month , 12 month post-FMT . The subject also monitor potential adverse event , recurrence MDRO infection , infection may relate FMT , worsen exist comorbidities development new comorbidities .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criterion include : Age â‰¥18 year old . Outpatient status time FMT . History least three recurrent infection due MDRO ; least two recurrent , severe infection due MDRO require hospitalization ; least two recurrent infection due MDRO antimicrobial rate limit toxicity ( see ) available AND MDRO likely enteric origin . Only MDROs likely enteric origin include . Be without active infection due MDRO time FMT . Not receive antimicrobial ( therapeutic suppressive ) within 48 hour FMT . Exclusion criterion include : Subjects &lt; 18 year old . Subjects unable see outpatient . Use enteral systemic antimicrobial time FMT . Planned use enteral systemic antimicrobial 6 month postFMT . Pregnancy inability/unwillingness use contraceptive . Recent intraabdominal surgery Short gut syndrome Gastrointestinal motility disorder Use medication affect intestinal motility inability cease use medication time FMT . Postallogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients previous current gastrointestinal graft versus host disease . ANC &lt; 500/mm3 HIV+ well control antiretroviral therapy , CD4+ &lt; 200/ mm3 At increase risk peritonitis : presence intraabdominal device , receive peritoneal dialysis , ascites . Any acute illness Recurrent C. difficile infection . Unlikely survive 3 month . Investigator feels risk FMT outweigh potential benefit , include condition medication investigator determines put subject great risk FMT .</criteria>
