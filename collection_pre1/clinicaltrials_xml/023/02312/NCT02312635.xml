	<brief_summary>Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) common cause death long-term disability child . Much long-term disability stem neurocognitive impairment greatly help current cognitive training pharmacological treatment TBI relate cognitive impairment . This study test hypothesis drug , D-cycloserine ( DCS ) , significantly enhance effect cognitive training correct cognitive impairment child moderate/severe TBIs . In order , study subject fit inclusion criterion , include moderate severe TBI show persistent work memory weakness base screening , recruit . They three visit UCLA . During first visit , subject undergo MRI protocol take pill ( drug placebo , blind ) . They also participate number paper pencil cognitive test . Then subject enrol 6 week computerize cognitive training program ( CogMed ) . They also prescribe drug/placebo pill ( depend group randomize ) , 'll take regular interval 6 week . They weekly check phone call visit coach trained program make sure follow study protocol accurately , question answer , motivation . At end training period , subject return UCLA complete MRI protocol cognitive testing . After three month enrollment , final visit UCLA , include cognitive testing . A total 30 subject enter study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Augmentation Cognitive Training Children With TBI With D-Cyloserine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design/Procedure : The propose study use double blind , parallel , placebo control design test hypotheses augmentation suppress NMDA receptor function follow pediatric msTBI D-cycloserine ( DCS ) increase neural activation , use conjunction cognitive training enhance effect cognitive training work memory ( WM ) . Participants show WM weakness within 12 24 month post-injury randomly assign one two arm propose study . Weakness WM operationally define work memory index ( WMI ) standard score 90 evidence least 10-point discrepancy IQ WMI . Given purpose study ( improve work memory ) , little utility include child demonstrate weakness WM . Participants treatment arm complete baseline evaluation WM executive functioning ( EF ) test assess generalization , parent complete questionnaire assess WM attentional functioning . ( Note : participant complete 12-month RAPBI visit within three month enrollment current project complete novel measure ) . All participant receive first Cogmed training session . During first visit , participant also complete MRI protocol immediately two hour first dose DCS placebo measure acute physiological response DCS . Both group complete six week Cogmed train addition either DCS placebo . Cogmed training complete home , parent/guardian supervise completion . During six week training , child speak coach week , guide child program help monitor his/her progress . Participants travel UCLA half-way training consult one medical personnel regard medication note side effect . At end sixth week , participant retested MRI protocol non-trained measure WM EF . Parents complete questionnaire assess WM attention . Three month termination treatment , participant return UCLA complete one session Cogmed training retested non-trained measure WM EF . Their parent complete questionnaire assess maintenance training . Intercurrent event : Participants propose project least 12 month post-TBI . It unlikely new treatment initiate 4.5 month enrol propose project . Nevertheless monitor medical behavioral treatment outside study ensure confounds . Cogmed Training : Participants perform Cogmed WM train program via web-based software personal computer . If personal computer , provide laptop borrow six week train . Participants train 45 minute per day , five day per week , six week . Memory stimulus present computerized system total eight visuospatial verbal WM training exercise . Each training exercise consist 15 trial . The exercise video game formatâ€”with colorful graphic crisp sound . In one spatial WM exercise child remembers sequence row light turn ; verbal WM exercise child recall number reverse order give . The child use computer mouse click answer earn point perform well . The exercise train child attend screen visualize location remember stimulus . For eight WM training exercise difficulty adjust change number stimulus remember . Training perform close capacity individual use adaptive staircase method adjust difficulty trial-by-trial basis . At end training day Improvement index calculate measure improvement training period . The Improvement index base person 's result three exercise . On first visit UCLA , coach meet child parent/guardian teach use Cogmed program . The coach may encourage use reward system motivate reinforce child training . The coach set weekly time contact family . During call , coach review child 's progress , offer encouragement , download performance data . The result improvement index share parent adult participant , similar standardize paper pencil neurocognitive test result share clinical setting . DCS treatment : DCS oppose effect low dose vs. high dose . In mouse cerebellar tissue invert U-shaped dose-response relationship . At low DCS concentration , agonist activity may reflect bind NMDA receptor ( NMDAR ) subunits . In contrast , high DCS concentration antagonist effect may become prominent . Consistent research , animal model clinical application , isolate low dose DCS treatment appear significant advantage chronic treatment high dos . In animal model , single dose DCS reverse cognitive impairment produce hippocampal lesion , anticholinergic agent , early social deprivation . In healthy animal , single dose DCS enhance extinction condition fear performance maze task , visual recognition memory . Mice treat single , low-dose DCS 24 72 hour TBI exhibit significantly rapid complete recovery motor memory function compare untreated control . Tachyphylaxis rapidly develop repeat dose DCS . A single dose DCS administer within 30 minute extinction train increase 24 hour retention fear extinction approximately 3-fold , whereas effect completely attenuate 5 dos DCS administer 10 day precede extinction training . We use isolated , low dos DCS propose project . When used treat psychiatric symptom cognitive impairment child typical dose 50-100mg . A meta-analysis effect DCS augmentation fear extinction exposure therapy find significant dose related effect across study one clinical study systematically investigated dos , evidence great efficacy high dose . In propose study participant receive 100 mg DCS . The meta-analysis find best effect evident DCS administer either immediately exposure training compare four hour delay . Animal model human study suggest DCS affect performance training ; instead , selectively improve memory consolidation new learn typically assess 24 hour training . The acute physiological effect DCS brain activation , however , observe two hour DCS administration fMRI . In propose study child take pill ( DCS placebo ) every day immediately prior Cogmed training . Over six week Cogmed train train 18 day take pill 12 day without take pill . This intermittent , isolate dose minimize tachyphylaxis reduce possibility Cogmed training result state dependent learning . Double Blind : The UCLA pharmacy fabricate identically appear capsule 100 mg DCS placebo . Only research pharmacist know whether child receive DCS Placebo . The child parent , Cogmed coach , research psychologist , clinician monitor side effect know drug child receiving . If clinically significant side effect , blind break . Safety monitoring : Children DCS placebo arm see Drs . Giza Choe , pediatric neurologist , nurse practitioner three four week initiation treatment . In addition , Cogmed coach probe side effect coach call . Side effect assess use structure instrument open-ended clinician inquiry . While scale rating stimulant-related adverse event , aware broadly accept tool glutamatergic agonist . Therefore , modify Physical Symptom Checklist develop Research Units Pediatric Psychopharmacology , include range potential adverse event . Maximizing compliance/minimizing attrition : Weekly phone call use check progress Cogmed ass motivation/compliance . As noted , coach may recommend use reward system motivate reinforce training . Any problem issue also discuss call , regard Cogmed medication side effect . Participants also meet medical personnel third fourth week training discus possible side effect .</detailed_description>
