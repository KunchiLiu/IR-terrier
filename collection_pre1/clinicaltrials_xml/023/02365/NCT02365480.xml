	<brief_title>Berberine Chloride Preventing Colorectal Cancer Patients With Ulcerative Colitis Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety berberine ( berberine chloride ) administer participant ulcerative colitis ( UC ) clinical remission receive maintenance therapy mesalamine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine molecular efficacy berberine examine follow biomarkers : - Plasma-based measure inflammation , include blood C-reaction protein ( CRP ) level , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , cytokine TNFa , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-8 IL-10 measure enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . - Tissue-based measure inflammation , include TNFα , COX-2 , NF-kappa ( κ ) B immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , anti-cancer action , include antigen Ki-67 ( Ki67 ) activate caspase-3 IHC , deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation SFRP1 , TCERG1L FBN2 , TFPI2 use methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction ( qMSP ) strategy . II . Clinical efficacy : UC relate symptom measure use Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index ( i.e . Mayo score ) ( UCDAI ) . III . Histological analysis inflammation : severity histologic inflammation evaluate use Geboes grade system . IV . Determine plasma concentration berberine . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive berberine chloride orally ( PO ) thrice daily ( TID ) 90 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Participants receive placebo PO TID 90 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow-up 30 day .</detailed_description>
