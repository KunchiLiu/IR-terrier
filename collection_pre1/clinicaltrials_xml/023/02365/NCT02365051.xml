	<detailed_description>More 5 million Americans dementia 15 million Americans , mostly family member , provide unpaid care individual . In absence cure widely effective pharmacotherapy combat dementia , translation implementation efficacious non-pharmacologic intervention exist service program sorely need . The Connecticut Home Care Program Elders ( CHCPE ) , Medicaid waiver state revenue-funded program old adult high risk nursing home admission , provide in-home community-based service coordinate care manager . In translational study , evidence-based intervention , Care Persons Dementia Environments ( COPE ) , incorporate CHCPE . COPE efficacious 4-month , in-home , non-pharmacologic intervention use occupational therapist advance practice nurse maximize physical function older adult dementia improve dementia management skill family caregiver ( CG ) . This trial randomly assign 290 CHCPE client dementia CGs receive either COPE plus customary CHCPE service , customary CHCPE service alone . The main study outcome measure similar original COPE efficacy trial . To maximize translational effort , study also : conduct formal cost-benefit analysis determine potential economic benefit add COPE customary CHCPE service ; evaluate feasibility acceptability COPE new CHCPE service ; establish expert Translational Advisory Committee help develop guide COPE dissemination plan implementation nationally . Study aim CHCPE client : Aim 1.1 : Determine COPE effect functional dependence 4 month randomization ( primary study endpoint ) . Aim 1.2 : Determine COPE effect engagement activity , quality life , NPS , 4 month randomization . Aim 1.3 : Determine COPE effect functional dependence , engagement activity , quality life , neuropsychiatric symptom ( NPS ) , 12 month randomization . We hypothesize CHCPE client receive COPE show great reduction functional dependence , great engagement activity , good quality life , few neuropsychiatric symptom , compare control , 4 month 12 month randomization . Study aim CGs : Aim 2.1 : Determine COPE effect perceive CG well-being 4 month randomization . Aim 2.2 : Determine COPE effect CG confidence use dementia management strategy 4 month randomization . Aim 2.3 : Determine COPE effect CG perceive well-being , confidence use activity , ability keep client home , 12 month randomization . We hypothesize COPE CGs report improvement specify outcome compare control , 4 12 month randomization . Translational study aim : Aim 3.1 : Determine net financial benefit COPE , account COPE intervention cost , CHCPE usual care cost , nurse home cost , service cost , 4 month 12 month randomization . The 12 month cost-benefit analysis test whether financial benefit COPE accrue long time horizon 4-month intervention period . Aim 3.2 : Determine feasibility acceptability COPE implementation CHCPE multiple stakeholder viewpoint , include CHCPE care manager state Medicaid public policy decision maker .</detailed_description>
