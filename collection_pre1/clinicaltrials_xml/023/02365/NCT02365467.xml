	<criteria>Subject least 18 year age . Subject understands sign Informed Consent approve Sponsor IRB study . Subject must consider candidate revascularization LSA . Subject must able tolerate surgical revascularization LSA . Subject DTA require coverage LSA : fusiform aneurysm diameter ≥ 5.5 cm OR &gt; 2 time diameter nonaneurysmal thoracic aorta ; AND/OR saccular aneurysm penetrate atherosclerotic ulcer ( ulcer define ≥ 10 mm depth 20 mm diameter ) OR chronic type B dissection define &gt; 30 day symptom onset complicate aortic diameter ≥ 5.5 cm progressive aortic enlargement ( &gt; 5 mm/year ) . Subject healthy , nondiseased aortic proximal seal zone least 10 mm LCC LSA least 5 mm land zone distal LSA proximal start aneurysm/ulcer 5 mm land zone distal LSA proximal entry tear dissection . Subject nondiseased aortic diameter 25 mm 42 mm ( fusiform/saccular aneurysm penetrate ulcer ) 28 mm 44 mm ( chronic type B dissection ) ; Subject LSA diameter 8 mm 13 mm . Subject sufficient land zone within LSA accommodate BSG without occlusion significant vessel Subject patent brachial artery , iliac femoral artery , tolerate conduit allow endovascular access aneurysmal site delivery system appropriate sized device choose treatment . •Subject condition require prospective revascularization LSA , include : oDominant leave vertebral artery require revascularization oPrior coronary artery bypass graft utilizing leave mammary artery require revascularization oIncomplete circle Willis neurological vasculature require revascularization Subject aneurysmal , tortuous , atherosclerotic LSA . Subject acute dissection descend thoracic aorta . Subject intramural hematoma descend thoracic aorta . Subject aortic atheroma classify grade IV grade V. Subject prohibitive calcification , occlusive disease , tortuosity intend fixation site . Subject previous endovascular repair ascend and/or descend thoracic aorta . Treatment Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft system would require intentional coverage leave common carotid artery stent graft fabric . Subject significant and/or circumferential aortic mural thrombus either proximal distal attachment site would compromise fixation seal device . Subject pregnant female . Subject know allergy intolerance device component . Subject acute renal failure renal insufficiency serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL dialysis . Subject body habitus prevents adequate visualization aorta . Subject coronary artery disease unstable angina receive treatment . Subject connective tissue disease ( e.g . Marfan 's syndrome , medial degeneration ) . Subject active systemic infection and/or mycotic aneurysm . Subject currently participate investigational drug device clinical trial would interfere observation study . Subject medical , social , psychological problem , opinion investigator , interfere treatment followup procedure . Subject life expectancy le 1 year . Subject require treatment infrarenal aneurysm time implantation . Subject previous surgical endovascular treatment infrarenal aortic aneurysm . Subject history bleeding diathesis , coagulopathy , refuse blood transfusion . Subject cerebral vascular accident ( CVA ) within prior 3 month . Subject myocardial infarction ( MI ) within prior 3 month . Subject know hypersensitivity contraindication anticoagulant contrast medium , amenable pretreatment .</criteria>
