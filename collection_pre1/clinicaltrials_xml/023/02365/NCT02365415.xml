	<brief_summary>This research study ass whether oral medication benefit patient treat peripheral pulmonary stenosis ( PPS ) . PPS , associate several different congenital heart disease , narrow blood vessel send blood lung ( pulmonary artery ) pick oxygen return blood heart rest body . The right ventricle ( RV ) pump chamber pump blood pulmonary artery lung . PPS result high RV pressure , reduce blood flow one lung , uneven blood flow within either lung . If leave untreated abnormality place affected child risk abnormal RV function failure pump chamber may see decrease ability exercise , heart rhythm problem , fainting , even death . In cardiac catheterization laboratory , investigator treat PPS dilate narrowed segment pulmonary artery use balloon catheter . Sometimes investigator also place stent mesh tube help keep narrowed vessel open . Some stent suffer in-growth tissue stent cause recurrent obstruction inside stent ( i.e . make open inside mesh tube narrow ) , call in-stent stenosis ( ISS ) . This effectively cause recurrent PPS recurrence associate risk list . The purpose study use medication approve use child ( different purpose ) decrease amount cell ingrowth inside stent ( i.e . decrease problematic in-stent stenosis ) . The medication call rapamycin , also know sirolimus ( trade name Rapamune ) , use safely many year child adult organ transplantation prevent rejection new organ . It antiproliferative property mean slows cell division investigator believe cause recurrent narrow inside stent . By slow cell division investigator believe stent stay open instead become narrow inside . This medicine find many type stent place adult narrowed artery around heart ( call drug-eluding stent ) appear help keep blood vessel open heart attack ( prevent heart attack ) . Such stent currently available pulmonary artery ; therefore investigator give medicine mouth instead ( also use adult stent narrow artery around heart ) . Rapamycin medicine take mouth liquid pill via feed tube . There still need intervention catheterization laboratory investigator hope take medicine child would need few catheterization future . The investigator believe may help lessen risk recurrent in-stent stenosis associate problem list . Our early experience patient BCH treat rapamycin due in-stent stenosis pulmonary artery suggest may helpful . In study , patient family interested possibly try new approach randomize sirolimus sirolimus . The investigator compare developement ISS time group , hope learn whether oral sirolimus reduces ISS development .</brief_summary>
