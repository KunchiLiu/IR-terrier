	<brief_title>ART-2 Pilot - Driving Pressure Limited Ventilation Patients With ARDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanical ventilation potential produce worsen alveolar injury . Driving pressure difference plateau pressure PEEP . Evidence observational study suggest elevate driving pressure main independent determinant ventilator-induced lung injury , however clinical trial need establish whether target low driving pressure improve clinical outcome patient acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . Thus , ART2pilot multicenter randomize control trial ass feasibility driving pressure limit mechanical ventilation strategy compare ARDS Clinical Network strategy ( conventional strategy ) patient ARDS . Patients consider trial mechanical ventilation diagnosis ARDS le 72 hour duration . We exclude patient le 18 year old ; contraindication hypercapnia intracranial hypertension recent acute coronary syndrome ; patient high probability death within 24 hour anticipated patient exclusive palliative care . Eligible patient randomize driving pressure limit ventilation strategy ARDSNet strategy . The primary outcome driving pressure day 1 3 .</detailed_description>
