	<brief_title>A Randomised Trial Imatinib Alternating With Regorafenib Compared Imatinib Alone First Line Treatment Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour ( GIST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS Background Despite highly active current treatment metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumour ( GIST ) use imatinib , people ultimately relapse die multifocal metastatic disease . Using alternate regimen imatinib regorafenib brief drug free interval may allow tumour stem cell re-enter cell cycle become susceptible drug therapy . Regorafenib , multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) activity angiogenic , stromal oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase , demonstrate activity treatment GIST FDA approve third line therapy advance GIST . General aim To determine alternate regimen imatinib regorafenib sufficient activity safety warrant evaluation first line treatment metastatic GIST . Design Prospective , randomise , open label phase II trial , stratify participate site , previous adjuvant therapy ( prior v none ) , previous imatinib metastatic disease le 21 day . Population The target population adult histologically confirm , measurable metastatic GIST , receive prior treatment metastatic disease . Patients currently take , 21 day uninterrupted treatment 400mg daily imatinib eligible participate study . Study treatments Patients randomise receive either : Arm A - imatinib 400mg orally daily continuously ( control arm ) ; Arm B - alternate 28-day period imatinib 400mg orally daily 21 25 day follow washout ( drug free ) period 3 7 day , regorafenib 160mg orally daily 3 week follow 7 day washout ( drug free ) period . Treatment continue disease progression prohibitive adverse event detail protocol . Statistical consideration In order demonstrate relative increase progression free survival 24 month date randomisation expect 78 % 88 % , 80 % power 95 % confidence base A'Hern 's adjustment Fleming 's design , approximately 110 evaluable participant require arm . Thus , propose enrol 240 participant trial , allow approximately 10 % drop-out rate . Currently 80 % participant expect achieve clinical benefit 24 month ( CBR - rate complete partial response , stable disease ) . A secondary outcome would determine whether minimum 25 % relative increase CBR ( 80 % 85 % ) experimental cohort attain . The study open recruitment 36 month follow-up continue last enrolled participant follow minimum 24 month time date commencement treatment .</detailed_description>
