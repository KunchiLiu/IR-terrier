	<detailed_description>Background : Obesity risk factor ventral hernia complication without repair , management strategy best balance overall risk benefit obese patient ventral hernias unknown . The primary aim project compare effect prehabilitation ( preoperative physical conditioning weight loss intervention ) versus standard preoperative counseling follow repair obese patient ( BMI 30-40 kg/m2 ) ventral hernia outcome . Methods : A comprehensive cohort study obese patient ventral hernia perform . Within comprehensive cohort study , patient candidate elective ventral hernia repair randomize prehabilitation intervention standard counsel surgical repair weight loss goal meet . All patient repair 6 month even meet weight loss goal . Patients eligible trial refuse participate follow non-randomized cohort ; hernia repair base upon current institution standard . ( figure 1 ) The primary outcome study proportion patient hernia- complication- free 2 year surgical consultation . This composite outcome choose order encompass clinically important risk benefit operative non-operative strategy . Based power calculation ( alpha=0.05 , beta=0.20 ) , 232 eligible patient need assume 30 % non-enrollment 50 % dropout . Since efficacy trial , analysis perform per protocol well intention treat . The primary outcome compare use Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test . Generalized linear mixed model ( GLMMs ) use identify independent predictor successful outcome define hernia- complication free 2 year . In addition frequentist analysis , Bayesian analysis perform . Posterior point estimate , credible interval , probability increase proportion patient without hernias complication calculate . Conclusion : Prehabilitation may impact outcomes follow ventral hernia repair , cause complication acute hernia presentation , prove superior decrease recurrence complication compare standard care . This randomize controlled trial provide baseline information efficacy prehabiliation prior open ventral hernia repair obese patient .</detailed_description>
