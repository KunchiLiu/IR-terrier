	<detailed_description>Amongst adolescent , gap widen age recommend sleep duration actual sleep time . Due gap , bodily mental function relate metabolic immune system , performance , memory , school achievement creative ability harm . Moreover , lack sleep involves increase risk accident injury , behavior problem reduce quality life . Biological factor explain change sleep pattern include delay circadian timing system homeostatic system regulate sleep wakefulness . These change cause grow continuous delay sleep phase adolescence .

Based Parental Style model , authoritative parenting style characterize parent set high demand child one hand display high level responsiveness child . The authoritarian parenting style characterize parent set high demand child one hand yet display low level responsiveness child . The permissive parenting style characterize parent set low demand child display high level responsiveness child . In several investigation , authoritative parenting style show positive influence child development , academic achievement psychosocial competency , promote healthy behavior adolescent , good eating habit , increase physical activity decrease risky behavior smoke , alcohol abuse , extreme diet early sexual behavior . The Conceptual Model view parent sole agent change child 's life , focus power personal example , environmental change promotion authoritative parental style . This model find effective field eat disorder never implement field sleep . The main aim research evaluate effectiveness intervention program deal increase parent ' awareness change characterize adolescent encourages authoritative parental style base Parenting Style Model ; also encourage parent make environmental change home base Conceptual Model order promote healthy behavior include healthy sleep pattern control exposure electronic medium young normative adolescent ( age 10-12 ) . Research Hypotheses : Hypothesis 1 : There link availability amount time spend use electronic medium . Adolescents medium device room expose long hour electronic medium compare medium device room . In addition , link availability medium device sleep pattern . Adolescents medium device room show delayed sleep pattern shorter sleep duration compare . Hypothesis 2 : There connection parental style , sleep pattern medium exposure habit young adolescent . Children parent authoritative style would exhibit proper sleep pattern exposure electronic medium ; child whose parent authoritarian parental style would longer sleep duration less exposure electronic medium compare parenting style . It assume child whose parent exhibit permissive parental style would shorter sleep duration exposure electronic medium compare parenting style . Hypothesis 3 : There connection sleep pattern , medium exposure habit quality life young adolescent . The study find good sleep pattern low exposure electronic medium relate high quality life young adolescent . Hypothesis 4 : The intervention program base Conceptual Model lead increase parent ' knowledge change characterize adolescent promote authoritative parental style . Hypothesis 5 : The intervention program lead improvement healthy behavior , include good sleep pattern , control use electronic medium , good quality life young adolescent . Method The sample include 70 dyad parent ( mostly mother ) adolescent school Jezreel Valley . The experimental group control group consist 35 participant ( 35 girl ) average age 10.7 ( 0.9 ) year . There three session data collection : 1. baseline , 2. immediately follow intervention , 3. three month post-intervention . Parents adolescent report electronic medium consumption , sleep pattern quality life . In addition , parent report parent style adolescent wear ActiGraph ( monitor sleep pattern ) fill sleep diary five day . Parents experimental group participate six workshop , parent control group receive information regard healthy sleep habit effect excessive medium exposure mail expect read .</detailed_description>
