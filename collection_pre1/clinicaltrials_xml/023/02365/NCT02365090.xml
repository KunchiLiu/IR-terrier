	<brief_title>Binocular iPad Sub-Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although patch treatment result improve visual acuity amblyopic child , fail achieve normal visual acuity month year treatment . Even among child achieve normal visual acuity amblyopia treatment , risk recurrence amblyopia high . Patching treatment base premise amblyopia monocular disorder treat force use amblyopic eye . However , recent study elucidate clear link binocular dysfunction complex constellation deficit characterize amblyopia , include visual acuity , vernier acuity , fixation instability , fusional suppression , risk residual recurrent amblyopia . The association binocular dysfunction myriad monocular binocular deficit amblyopia lead u hypothesize amblyopia monocular consequence primary binocular obstacle normal visual development . Although binocular interaction normally occur amblyopia , weak , noisy signal amblyopic eye contribute binocular vision suppression fellow eye reduce signal attenuation , reduce stimulus contrast . In small cohort amblyopic adult schoolchildren , repeat practice binocular Falling Blocks iPod game reduce fellow eye contrast yield modest visual acuity improvement 1-5 week ( Hess et al 2010 , 2012 , 2014 ; Knox et al 2011 ; Li et al 2012 ) . Recently , show binocular game app approach ( reduce fellow eye contrast ) could adapt home use amblyopic child large iPad display ( Li et al 2014 ; Birch et al 2014 ) . These game also effective improve visual acuity , visual acuity gain maintain least 6 month ( Li et al 2014a , 2014b ) . The major limitation set study game interesting quickly become tedious play day day . To overcome limitation , propose evaluate new , engage binocular iPad adventure game determine whether practice binocular iPad game app , reduce fellow eye contrast , improve visual acuity reduce interocular suppression child amblyopia.One group participant include 56 child anisometropic , strabismic , combine mechanism amblyopia , age 4-10 year . The participant randomly assign patch 2 hour daily patch ( standard-of-care treatment ) play iPad game app 1 hour per day 5 day per week 2 week . Half child prior treatment amblyopia half prior amblyopia treatment ; two subgroup randomize separately . A blocked randomization order provide sealed envelope consultant statistician . A second group participant include 40 child deprivation amblyopia due cataract . The participant randomly assign continue patch regimen ( ) continue current patching regimen also play iPad game app 1 hour per day 5 day per week 4 week . iPads game app loan family duration study , Vision test baseline 2 week primary outcome change visual acuity ( strabismic , anisometropic , combine mechanism amblyopia ) baseline 4 week ( deprivation amblyopia ) . At primary outcome visit , patch group cross play iPad game app 1 hour per day 5 day per week return secondary outcome 4 week ( strabismic , anisometropic , combine mechanism amblyopia ) 8 week ( deprivation amblyopia ) . Families option discontinue continue game app 8 week , test every 4 week .</detailed_description>
