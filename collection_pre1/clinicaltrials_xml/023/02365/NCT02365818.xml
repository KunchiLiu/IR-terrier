	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy CG0070 Oncolytic Virus Regimen High Grade NMIBC After BCG Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The plan study safety efficacy CG0070 high-grade NMIBC patient fail BCG therapy . Most patient NMIBCis ( Cis , Cis Ta and/or T1 , high grade Ta T1 frequent uncontrolled recurrence ) fail BCG intravesical therapy ( standard care ) usually choice proceed cystectomy . Cystectomy surgery associate major morbidity , mortality quality life issue . Morbidity long term tedious medical care rest patient 's life span . Most patient stage show sign disease progression muscle layer metastasis , make surgery difficult decision . CG0070 , successful trial , serve provide therapeutic alternative patient population need .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must pathologically confirm nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) high grade disease ( HG ) , defined 2004 WHO classification system 2 . Patients must evidence muscle invasive disease 3 . Patients must able provide sufficient biopsy sample central pathologist histopathologically confirm , transitional cell ( urothelial ) carcinoma . Urothelial tumor mixed histology ( &lt; 50 % variant ) eligible . 4 . Patients must receive least two prior course intravesical therapy per recommend schedule . BCG must one prior therapy administer . 5 . Patients either fail BCG induction therapy within sixmonth period successfully treat BCG , subsequently find recurrence . The first standard course intravesical BCG therapy must include least six weekly treatment ( allowable range instillation per course 49 ) . The second course BCG therapy must include least two weekly treatment . 6 . Patients either Cis Cis Ta and/or T1 disease enrollment past . For patient Ta T1 disease enrollment AND history Cis , must disease recurrence either must occur within 12 month recent intravesical therapy kind , OR disease recurrence within 18 month BCG maintenance OR disease recurrence within 24 month BCG induction T1 patient need evidence muscle include late biopsy ; reTURBT do prior enrollment 7 . 18 year age old 8 . Radical cystectomy decline patient sign special section inform consent , whereby clear explanation investigator subject delay cystectomy may increase his/her chance disease progression , result may lead serious life threaten consequence . 9 . Patients must able enter study within ten week recent diagnostic procedure , usually diagnostic biopsy , transurethral resection bladder tumor ( TURBT ) procedure positive urine cytology . 10 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &lt; 2 . 11 . Not pregnant lactate 12 . Patients child bear potential must agree use adequate contraception 13 . Agree study specific informed consent HIPAA authorization release personal health information 14 . Adequate baseline CBC , renal hepatic function . Parameters describe WBC &gt; 3000 cells/mm^3 , ANC &gt; 1,000 cells/mm^3 , hemoglobin &gt; 9.5g/dL , platelet count &gt; 100,000 cells/mm^3 Adequate renal function : serum creatinine &lt; 2.5mg/dL Bilirubin , AST ALT 2 x Upper Limits Normal PT/INR , PTT , fibrinogen within institutional acceptable limit Absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 800/μL first dose CG0070 1 . Previous systemic chemotherapy radiation bladder cancer . Note : Prior immunotherapy intravesical ( administer within bladder ) chemotherapy superficial disease acceptable 2 . History anaphylactic reaction follow exposure humanize human therapeutic monoclonal antibody , hypersensitivity GMCSF yeast derive product , clinically meaningful allergic reaction know hypersensitivity prior reaction formulation excipients study drug . 3 . Known infection HIV , HBV HCV . 4 . Anticipated use chemotherapy radiotherapy specify study protocol study 5 . Any underlying medical condition , Investigator 's opinion , make administration study vector hazardous patient , would obscure interpretation adverse event , permit adequate surgical resection . 6 . Systemic treatment investigational clinical trial within 28 day prior registration . 7 . Concurrent treatment immunosuppressive immunomodulatory agent , include systemic steroid ( exception : inhale topically applied steroid , acute chronic standard dose NSAIDs , permit ) . Use short course ( i.e. , ≤ 1 day ) glucocorticoid acceptable prevent reaction IV contrast use CT scan . 8 . Immunosuppressive therapy , include : cyclosporine , antithymocyte globulin , tacrolimus within 3 month study entry . 9 . History prior experimental cancer vaccine treatment ( e.g. , dendritic cell therapy , heat shock vaccine ) within last year 10 . History stage III great cancer , exclude urothelial cancer . Basal squamous cell skin cancer must adequately treated subject must diseasefree time registration . Subjects history stage I II cancer , must adequately treated diseasefree ≥ 2 year time registration . 11 . Progressive persistent viral bacterial infection All infection must resolve patient must remain afebrile seven day without antibiotic prior place study Urinary tract infection , include particularly bladder infection , must resolve prior place study 12 . Unwilling unable comply protocol cooperate fully investigator site personnel</criteria>
