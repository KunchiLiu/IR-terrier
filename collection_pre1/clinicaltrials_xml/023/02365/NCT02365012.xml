	<brief_summary>This study evaluate whether treatment α1-agonist , midodrine , reduces subjective orthostatic lightheadedness measure Non-Motor Symptoms Scale Parkinson 's Disease ( NMSS ) questionnaire , patient ( positive control group , OH ) without document orthostatic hypotension ( orthostatic intolerance , OI ) . It also demonstrate effect treatment α1-agonist , midodrine , beat-to-beat blood pressure heart rate response Valsalva maneuver ( measure Continuous Non-invasive Arterial Pressure , CNAP ) patient OI OH evaluate relationship symptom improvement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Orthostatic Intolerance Patients With Parkinson 's Disease Using Midodrine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This cross-over study participant OI randomize initially receive midodrine placebo cross opposite treatment three week ( 2 week midodrine placebo plus one week wash period ) . The control group consist participant OH PD treat midodrine . Basic demographic data include collect medical record participant consent . At study visit , participant undergo traditional measurement blood pressure heart rate well measurement beat-to-beat blood pressure heart rate use CNAP™ valsalva maneuver response stand 5 minute sit . Symptoms orthostatic intolerance measure study visit use Domain 1 Non-Motor Symptoms Scale Parkinson 's Disease ( NMSS ) . At initial study visit , participant also administer first dose midodrine placebo . Supine sit , stand systolic diastolic blood pressure pulse rate measure immediately 1 hour administration drug placebo . This blood pressure monitoring process take place four study visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients diagnosis idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease 2 . Those patient measure orthostatic hypotension include positive control group 3 . Those patient without measurable orthostatic hypotension symptom lightheadedness stand include study group 1 . Diagnosis degenerative parkinsonian syndrome idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease 2 . Inability stand independently remain stand 5 minute 3 . Cognitive impairment significant enough affect ability patient provide inform consent reliably report orthostatic symptom 4 . Patients pacemaker also exclude study measure heart rate response could potentially alter pacemaker 5 . Because study use drug affect blood pressure , patient stand BP &gt; 139/90 heart rate &lt; 60 exclude 6 . Because study use drug affect supine hypertension , patient supine BP &gt; 139/90 heart rate &lt; 60 exclude 7 . Current treatment drug orthostatic hypotension fludrocortisone 8 . Patients phenylephrine , pseudoephedrine , ephedrine , phenylpropanolamine , dihydroergotamine 9 . Patients acute chronic renal failure ( GFR &lt; 60 ) 10 . Patients history pheochromocytoma , urinary retention , severe cardiac disease , history congestive heart failure , diabetes , narrowangle glaucoma , arrhythmia , bradycardia , severe hyperthyroidism , severe difficult urination ( due urinary retention enlarge prostate ) 11 . Pregnant breastfeed woman . 12 . Women childbearing potential effective contraceptive method birth control and/or unwilling unable test pregnancy . 13 . Women childbearing potential must confirm negative pregnancy test screen randomization visit . They must use effective contraceptive method throughout study , agree repeat urine pregnancy test designate visit . The applied method contraception meet criterion highly effective method birth control ( condom , FDA approve oral contraceptive , patch , injection , ring , IUD ) . 14 . Patients know drug allergy hypersensitive midodrine .</criteria>
