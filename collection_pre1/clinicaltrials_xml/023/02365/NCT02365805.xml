	<detailed_description>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) increasingly use early-stage operable breast cancer . Response breast cancer NAC correlate survival : patient obtain great survival advantage attain complete response primary tumor.BReast Cancer 1 ( BRCA1 ) play crucial role DNA repair . Associations BRCA1 mRNA expression sensitivity platinum and/or resistance taxanes previously document . Improving complete response rate NAC improve outcomes breast cancer . If establish biomarkers predict good response may optimize treatment individualize breast cancer care . Therefore , propose two-arm , randomize , multi-centre , open-label phase II study . The study compare efficacy tolerability NAC customize BRCA 1 level versus standard chemotherapy , pathological complete response primary endpoint . Women primary Her-2 negative breast cancer undergone previous treatment invasive breast cancer randomize receive following : Treatment Arm 1 ( standard therapy ) : 5-Fluorouracil , Epirubicin Cyclophosphamide day 1 every 3 week per three cycle ; Treatment Arm 2 : Patients low level BRCA1 mRNA receive Epirubicin Cisplatin day 1 every 3 week 5-Fluorouracil three cycle ; And patient high level BRCA1 receive docetaxel day 1 every three week per three cycle . Definitive surgery perform within 4 week last cycle .</detailed_description>
