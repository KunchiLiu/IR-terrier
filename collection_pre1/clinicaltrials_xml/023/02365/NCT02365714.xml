	<criteria>Newly diagnose Stage 0 I breast cancer . On histological examination , tumor must DCIS invasive nonlobular carcinoma breast Surgical treatment breast must wide excision , lumpectomy partial mastectomy Age 50 year great ER positive : ( ≥1 % breast tumor cell express ER nucleus ) PR ( progesterone receptor ) positive : ( ≥ 1 % breast tumor cell express PR nucleus ) Her2 negative ( IHC 01+ ; IHC 2+ , FISH ( fluorescence situ hybridization ) must nonamplified ) Subjects invasive tumor undergo axillary sentinel lymph node evaluation axillary lymph node dissection . Negative inked surgical margin excision reexcision , clear invasive tumor ( cell ink ) DCIS least 1 mm Negative postexcision postreexcision mammography cancer present malignancyassociated microcalcifications remain suspicious calcification breast radiotherapy . Alternatively , specimen radiograph obtain show suspicious calcification . No involved axillary lymph node , N0 ( i+ ) allow Enrollment plan initiate CyberKnife therapy within 12 week last breast cancer surgery . Target lumpectomy cavity/whole breast reference volume must &lt; 30 % base treatment plan CT Signed studyspecific inform consent form Patients invasive lobular carcinoma nonepithelial breast malignancy sarcoma lymphoma . Patients tumor great 2 cm Patients surgical margin microscopically assess clear least 2mm pathological evaluation . Patients multicentric carcinoma clinically radiographically suspicious area ipsilateral breast unless confirm negative malignancy biopsy . Breast MRI recommend exclude multicentric disease additional suspicious area require biopsy exclude malignancy . Patient lymphovascular space invasion ( LVSI ) . Patients involve axillary node . Patients collagen vascular disease . Patient know deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation know mutation high penetrance gene ( TP53 , STK11 , PTENphosphatase tensin homolog , CDH1 ) Patients prior ipsilateral breast irradiation . Patients prior ipsilateral thoracic irradiation . Patients Paget 's disease nipple . Patients diffuse suspicious microcalcifications . Patients suspicious microcalcifications remain postexcision mammogram .
