	<brief_title>Tea Consumption Iron Bioavailability Women Using Stable Isotope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non randomise control trial 12 healthy participant period 56 day . The study investigate inhibition effect tea consumption non haem iron absorption use stable iron isotope ( Fe57 ) tracer . The study also aim assess effect time variability tea consumption non haem iron absorption typical western breakfast.There evidence low iron absorption meal give tea , compare water . There also evidence previous study inhibition effect high tea consume simultaneously meal , compare meal . However , limited number human study investigate iron absorption time interval , particularly UK . The study aim recruit 12 healthy participant . The test meal give together black tea label iron tracer , various time interval include together meal . Test meal give water use control . Blood sample collect 14 day post dosage meal . The study take place University Chester , participant attend 5 clinic 56 day study . Prior start study , participant complete 3 day food diary , give instruction researcher . In clinic , weight height measure , follow fast blood sample administration test meal . PROJECT HYPOTHESES H1 : There significant difference non haem iron absorption typical western breakfast tea consumption compare without tea consumption H0 : There significant difference non haem iron absorption typical western breakfast tea consumption compare without tea consumption H1 : Iron absorption lower tea consume simultaneously meal compare consumed meal H0 : The iron absorption lower tea consume simultaneously meal compare consumed meal H1 : There inverse correlation tea consumption iron status parameter H0 : There inverse correlation tea consumption iron status parameter There several parameter measure study . Height weight measure use method outline Manual Dietetic Practice use validated equipment ( weigh scale stadiometer ) . These measure student researcher baseline clinic ( Clinic 1 5 ) . Dietary intake measure base data gather 3 day food diary complete participant prior Clinic 1 5 . Additionally , blood sample take student researcher clinic . The analysis carry Clinical Laboratories Phlebotomy Room within Department Clinical Sciences Nutrition ( University Chester ) , utilising equipment clinical space participant report administration meal iron tracer . Test meal prepare food skill kitchen within department . Analysis blood sample also carry Clinical Sciences laboratory use relevant methodology , include ELISA assay , bioanalysers mass spectrometry . After administration meal label iron tracer , blood sample store 80C laboratory analysis . RECRUITMENT PROCESS The sampling carry University Chester . Posters/leaflets letter/emails used medium advertisement target group , especially staff student . The potential participant require information give participant information sheet explain procedure study . STUDY PROCEDURE Clinic visit take place 0800 1000 ( last approximately 45 minute ) Clinical Sciences &amp; Nutrition laboratory , University Chester . 5 clinic require , time interval 14 day clinic allow incorporation stable iron isotope ( Fe57 ) tracer blood . During clinic , participant give test meal label iron tracer tea , food drink allow next 3 4 hour . All container use administer test meal wash ultrapure water make sure complete consumption test meal iron tracer . Participants attend clinic overnight fast ( 10 hour ) , 30 ml blood sample ( 6 teaspoon ) collect clinic . All clinic detail give . Clinic 1 ( Day 0 ) : Participants complete screen questionnaire , follow physical measurement height weight . If satisfy inclusion criterion , invite participate study ask sign inform consent form . Participants ask food consumption previous 24 hour require complete 3 day food diary reflect habitual intake . Participants give explanation record dietary intake . Height weight measure , follow baseline blood sample . This followed consumption control test meal . Clinic 2 ( Day 14 ) : Measurement height weight follow baseline blood sample 24 hour food recall carry . This follow consumption test meal II tea give simultaneously test meal . Clinic 3 ( Day 28 ) : Measurement height weight follow baseline blood sample 24 hour food recall carry . This follow consumption test meal III tea give 1 hour test meal . Clinic 4 ( Day 42 ) : Measurement height weight follow baseline blood sample 24 hour food recall carry . This follow consumption reference dose iron . Clinic 5 ( Day 56 ) : Prior completion study , participant give another 3 day food diary complete clinic another assessment dietary intake . Measurement height weight follow final blood sample drawn measure incorporation iron reference dose 24 hour food recall . DATA PLAN Sample size determination justification : Sample size estimate use iron absorption data ( mean ± S.D ) study Derman et al . ( 1977 ) report iron absorption ( % ) 6.7 ± 6.2 test meal administer tea 34.0 ± 23.0 test meal administer without tea . With effect size 1.324 , total sample size require propose study 10 . Taking account 20 % drop rate , total sample size require demonstrate significant difference iron absorption consumption meal without tea 12 ( Power = 0.95 ) . Data Analysis : All statistical analysis conduct research student IBM® SPSS® Statistic Data Editor Software ( Version 21 ) . Values iron absorption meal ratio express geometric mean standard deviation . Iron absorption value ( percentage ) logarithmically transform purpose analysis retransformed recover original unit ( Hurrell et al. , 1999 ) . Assuming data normally distribute perform normality test ( Shapiro Wilks ) , paired student test conduct ( ) compare iron absorption pair meal ( ii ) obtain absorption ratio test meal relative reference dose without meal . Pearson 's correlation test perform investigate relationship tea drinking iron status biomarkers . A nonparametric approach adopt data normally distribute analysis . Differences consider significant p value &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
