	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis : Some child adolescent fish allergy tolerate eat specie fish Purpose study : The purpose study determine degree fish allergic child adolescent tolerate specie fish find minimal elicit allergen dose 10 % participant get allergic reaction . Participants : Participants 40 patient recruited child adolescent outpatient clinic University Hospital North Norway history fish allergy sensibilisation one fish specie either positive specific IgE serum skin prick test . Patients sensibilisation one fish specie never eat fish also recruit . Method : - All participant undergo clinical examination include lung function test spirometry inclusion study . - All participant test allergic sensibilisation measure specific IgE common food inhalation allergens addition 10 different fish specie . - All participant challenge cod , salmon , mackerel placebo , disguise chocolate mousse . The challenge perform randomized order Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food Challenge ( DBPCFC ) 4 different challenge day minimum 6 week challenge day . - Participant allergy pollen challenge pollen season . - Test food develop especially study cooperation The National Institute Food Research Norway The University Manchester . The National Institute Food Research Norway produce dried powder cod , salmon mackerel . The `` Molecular Allergology group Manchester Institute Biotechnology , University Manchester , produce test kit base chocolate mousse contain low high dos fish powder . The National Institute Food Research measure protein content microbiology fish powder . The Molecular Allergology group provide quality measurement final product test disguise sensoric test panel . - Participants allergic reaction one blind challenge undergo open food challenge large dos cook fish use DBPCFC , randomization broken .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Fish important role human food provide valuable source highly assimilated protein consumption fish increase world . Fish allergy one common food allergy together milk , egg , nut , peanut , fruit , wheat , soy seafood . It common coastal country country tradition fish industry fish play important role food tradition . This situation Northern Norway fish fish industry important way make live fish important part food . Allergy fish particularly common child young adult . The symptom related fish allergy vary mild symptom anaphylaxis . Most patient fish allergy avoid specie fish health care worker often advice . The major allergen fish muscle parvalbumin resistant heat , chemical denaturation proteolytic enzyme . Due homology amino acid sequence parvalbumins different fish specie , cross-reactivity exists . However , clinical experience , study sensibilisation , open food challenge study indicate patient fish allergy tolerate specie fish . The main purpose study find degree fish allergic child adolescent tolerate specie fish , use DBPCFC gold standard diagnosis food allergy , thereby avoid unnecessary food restriction diet . The food industry often label product `` main contain allergen '' lack information threshold dose allergic reaction . Unnecessary label food result le variation diet food allergic patient . Another purpose study find Minimal Eliciting Dose 10 % participant get allergic reaction , thereby contribute precise label food . Method : DBPCFC gold standard diagnosis food allergy . To disguise taste smell fish standardize test food good taste texture difficult . It especially difficult child , less likely eat food bad taste volume test food manage limit . In cooperation The National Institute Food Research Norway produce dried fish powder cod , salmon mackerel . Frozen filet cook , dry make powder . The powder check microbiologic content protein content . The procedure involve remove much fat possible . The powder store freezer temperature -20°C . The volume decrease 80 % compare cooked fish . In cooperation Professor Clare Mills Molecular Allergology group , Manchester Institute Biotechnology , The University Manchester , fish powder put chocolate dessert base recipe use EuroPrevall study food allergy . The production chocolate dessert perform University Manchester together quality check regard allergen content , content parvalbumin , microbiology speciation fish . The disguise taste smell test sensoric test panel . Recruitment participant : Patients age 5-20 yr , history fish allergy sensibilisation fish visit one outpatient clinic child adolescent university hospital Northern Norway , invited participate . Patients sensibilisation fish never eat fish also invite . In addition , patient register sensibilisation cod allergology lab , University Hospital Northern Norway since 2008 , already pick outpatient clinic invite participate . The laboratory allergology laboratory region participant recruit . Examination inclusion : All patient give consent participate undergo clinical examination , include spirometry , inclusion ensure eligibility . The clinical examination contain measurement weight height , heart lung auscultation , examination skin , conjunctiva , nose oral cavity . Special attention give uncontrolled asthma eczema ensure optimize treatment inclusion . Pollen allergic patient undergo food challenge pollen season . Measurement specific Immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) serum : In participant , specific IgE serum follow allergen measure : 1 . Fx5 ( Egg , milk , cod , wheat , soy , peanut ) 2 . Inhalation panel 6 ( Birch , timothy , mugwort , alternaria , cladosporium ) 3 . Inhalation panel 7 ( Cat , horse , dog , house dust mite , rabbit ) 4 . Gad c1 , f426 ( Parvalbumin cod ) 5 . Cyp c1 , f355 ( Parvalbumin carp ) 6 . Salmon , f41 7 . Mackerel , f206 8 . Halibut , f303 9 . Pollock , f413 10 . Haddock , f42 11 . Herring , f205 12 . Plaice,4254 13 . Tuna , f40 14 . Shrimp , f24 15. f351 ( recombinant shrimp tropomyosin ) Questionnaire : Parents answer questionnaire research allergy . The questionnaire translate Norwegian electronic survey use . The parent answer questionnaire first challenge day . The questionnaire extend question regard fish allergy . Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food Challenge cod , salmon , mackerel placebo : All participant undergo DBPCFC cod , salmon , mackerel placebo randomize order , disguised chocolate dessert 4 separate challenge day minimum 6 week challenge day . Participants experience anaphylaxis , verify treated hospital , challenge specie give anaphylaxis . Symptoms record clinical manifestation record sheet base protocol University Hospital South Manchester grade symptom define stop criterion . The protein dose base experience EuroPrevall study DBPCFC cod : 3µg , 600µg , 12mg , 120mg and1g DBPCFC Open challenge cod and/or salmon mackerel : Participants allergic reaction DBPCFC either cod , salmon mackerel , undergo open challenge ( ) 2 g , 6 g 12 g protein , serve cooked fish , specie give negative DBPCFC . The open challenge do separate day randomization code broken . Ceasing medication DBPCFC open challenge : Systemic corticosteroid therapy cease least one week challenge . Antihistamine treatment cease least 72 hour challenge . Short act β-2 agonist cease least 6 hour challenge Long act β-2 agonist least 24 hour challenge . Participants allow continue inhalant corticosteroid leukotriene receptor antagonist . Postponing DBPCFC open challenge : The challenge postpone participant ongoing infection , ongoing allergic reaction , uncontrolled eczema uncontrolled asthma . Participants pollen allergy challenge pollen season . Observation treatment allergic reaction : All fish challenge perform research unit University Hospital North Norway period September 2014 - February 2015 . Two participant challenge challenge day participant observe one blind research nurse . Unblinded staff prepare test meal every morning . One blind doctor examines participant , challenge decide whether challenge positive negative . The challenge stop participant develop objective sign allergic reaction . Stop criterion predefined . Participants observe hospital least two hour challenge stop . Allergic anaphylactic reaction treat accord European Academy Allergology Clinical Immunology position paper Anaphylaxis . Participants contact blind research nurse phone next day record late reaction discharge .</detailed_description>
