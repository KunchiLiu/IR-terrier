	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab Combination With Gemcitabine Therapy Cis-eligible/Ineligible UC Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : Phase Ib Dose-Finding Cohort I Cisplatin-Eligible : Phase Ib 3+3 design cisplatin-eligible group . Cisplatin-eligible subject receive : gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV D1 D8 every 21 day repeat 4 cycle ; cisplatin 70mg/m2 IV D1 D8 every 21 day , repeat 4 cycle . ( Subjects Ccr 50-59 mL/min must follow split dose cisplatin two day ) . Pembrolizumab give every 3 week 5 dos , start dose 200 mg . NOTE : last dose pembrolizumab fall would D8 5th 'chemo ' cycle , however gemcitabine/cisplatin NOT GIVEN . Phase II Arm A : Cohort I Cisplatin-Eligible : Cisplatin-eligible subject receive : gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV D1 D8 every 21 day repeat 4 cycle ; cisplatin 70mg/m2 IV D1 D8 every 21 day , repeat 4 cycle . ( Subjects Ccr 50-59 mL/min must follow split dose cisplatin two day ) . Pembrolizumab recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) give every 3 week 5 dos start C1D8 . NOTE : last dose pembrolizumab fall would day 8 5th 'chemo ' cycle , however gemcitabine/cisplatin NOT GIVEN . Cohort I treatment gemcitabine cisplatin continue maximum 4 cycle ( cycle = 21days ) . Phase II Arm B : Cohort II : Cisplatin-ineligible subject receive gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV D1 , D8 D15 every 28 day , repeat 3 cycle . Pembrolizumab RP2D give every 3 week 5 dos start C1D8 . NOTE : due time gemcitabine cycle every 4 week , every three week dose pembrolizumab , two dos pembrolizumab give cycle 2 : D1 D22 . Additionally , last dose pembrolizumab fall would D8 4th 'chemo ' cycle ; however gemcitabine NOT GIVEN . Cohort II treatment gemcitabine continue maximum 3 cycle ( cycle = 28 day ) Subjects surgery remove primary tumor within 2-7 week last dose neoadjuvant therapy . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOC ) performance status : 0-1 cisplatin-eligible subject ; 0-2 cisplatin-ineligible subject . Demonstrate adequate organ function define follow laboratory value study entry . All screen lab perform within 28 day C1D1 . Hematopoetic : - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /mcL - Absolute lymphocyte count ≥350 mcL - Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL - Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ≥5.6 mmol/L Renal : - Measured calculated creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min Hepatic : - Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.25 X ULN OR ≤ 2.5 x ULN subject Gilbert 's disease - Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST , SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT , SGPT ) ≤ 2 X ULN Coagulation : - International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant - Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant</detailed_description>
