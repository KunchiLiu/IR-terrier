	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESIS Comprehensive intervention fragility patient older 70 year hospitalization cardiac decompensation improve survival quality life patient reduce decompensation hospital admission . OBJECTIVES Main objective : 1 . Check comprehensive program frail elderly patient diagnose heart failure improve survival patient heart failure . Secondary objective : 1 . Improving quality life functional parameter patient fragility heart failure . 2 . Check comprehensive program fragility reduce number emergency room visit , outpatient specialty involve hospital admission . MATERIAL AND METHODS Study Design The investigator design randomize intervention study control group , unpaired , period 12 month . The intervention group include program specifically develop study base multidimensional continuous care patient heart failure frailty diagnosis prefrailty . A joint interdisciplinary nursing intervention include physical part ( endurance , strength , flexibility balance ) , nutrition ( enteral nutritional advice plus supplement specify ) , cognitive ( detection treatment depression delirium medical consultation ) take , hormonal ( Vitamin D supplementation require adjust guide ) ( Annex 1 ) , occupational clinical guideline pharmacological adjust accord requirement ( Annex 1 ) , pre-frail old 70 year fragile patient period 12 month follow-up admission decompensated heart failure , either primary secondary diagnosis . The control group include program quarterly monitoring receive nutritional support ( nutritional advice plus enteral supplementation specify ) , cognitive ( detection treatment depression delirium medical consultation ) , hormonal ( supplementation vitamin D require adjustment guide ) ( Annex 1 ) pharmacological treatment heart failure comorbidities adjust accord recent clinical guideline requirement ( Annex 1 ) 70 pre-frail frail patient period 12 month follow-up enter decompensated heart failure , either primary secondary diagnosis . In group initial recruit visit take place hospitalization , attend inclusion pre decompensation lead admission baseline , use `` CSHA Clinical Frailty Scale '' include patient present score 4 , 5 6 ( vulnerable , moderate brittleness fragility light ) . Sample The University Hospital Ribera serve population 263,006 inhabitant accord National Statistics Institute 2011 , 13.5 % 70 year old . Of , prevalence 15 % fragility prefrailty 34 48.8 % 8-17 % estimate cardiaca43 failure . It estimate 54 % patient 70 heart failure frail . Sample size Has increase accuracy 5 % , maintain level confidence study 95 % , estimate 12 month 5 % sample ratio estimate loss 10 % mortality size obtain sample 476 individual total , divide two group : 238 intervention group 238 control group . The recruitment patient perform continuously require sample size study , thus end complete one year follow last individual recruit . SCHEDULE Visit 0 . Both group . During first 72 hour hospitalization . Delivery patient information leaflet inform ( Annex 3 ) event consent include study previous explanation detail physician consent . -Randomization patient one two group . VALUATION - Assessment And comprehensive geriatric nurse . - Delivery Date next visit within 15 day discharge margin three day possible problem administrative subpoena . - Making ECG Rx . thorax . - Analytical Determination ( complete blood count , renal function , liver function , total protein , albumin , C-reactive protein , total cholesterol , fibrinogen , D-dimer , TSH , T4 , calcidiol , PTH iron metabolism . In addition , mine especially determination molecular parameter related oxidation . - Determination special analytical determination molecular parameter related oxidation . A determination least 15 day hospital discharge end year track : - Plasma malondialdehyde ( High performance liquid chromatography ) . - Plasma oxidize protein ( Western blotting ) . - Serum interleukin ( IL ) -6 tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -α ( ELISA Kits ) . - Plasma GDF-11 ( Western blot ) . - Plasma Meterorin-like ( ELISA Kit ) . Will collect number epidemiological , anthropometric , clinical social field data obtain assessment question patient basal state onset clinical deterioration lead admission variable . These variable use assessment patient successive visit . - After hospital discharge , make attend physician hospitalization , adjust treatment heart failure comorbidities accord recent clinical guideline publish ( Appendix 1 ) . - Only For intervention group : - Explanation intervention group plan exercise home , begin first visit post-hospitalization . VISITS AFTER HOSPITALIZATION - The quarterly medical visit ( intervention group control group ) conduct outpatient clinic Hospital de la Ribera , Alzira ( Valencia ) physician . They must equip computer SIAS , GAIA Internet system , printer , telephone , table electrocardiograph . The analytical radiographic control carry central service hospital . - The Monthly visit nursing ( intervention group ) send address less coincident quarterly patient medical examination , perform outpatient clinic Hospital de la Ribera , Alzira ( Valencia ) . These monthly visit conduct group nurse available graduate physiotherapist educate heart failure physical functional assessment patient . - The Quarterly visit nursing ( intervention group control group ) conduct outpatient clinic Hospital de la Ribera , Alzira ( Valencia ) coincide quarterly medical assessment . These quarterly visit also make group nurse available / o graduate physiotherapist educate heart failure physical functional assessment patient . He provide nurse , physiotherapist optional paper notebook variable describe card 0 identification number patient completion successive visit , facilitate collection storage confidential data . INTERVENTION GROUP - SCHEDULE OF MEDICAL VISITS : - Visit 1 : 15 day hospital discharge lead-time three day adjust possible administrative need . The current comprehensive geriatric assessment describe previous section also collect test scale establish study ( Appendix 2 ) time hospital discharge perform . - Visit 2 : 3 month visit 1 , timeframe three day adjust possible administrative need . - Visit 3 : three month visit 2 , timeframe three day adjust possible administrative need . - Visit 4 : 3 month visit 3 , timeframe three day adjust possible administrative need . - Visit 5 : 3 month visit 4 lead-time three day adjust possible administrative need . CONTROL GROUP - SCHEDULE OF MEDICAL VISITS : - Visit 1 : 15 day hospital discharge lead time three day adjust possible administrative need . The test variables scale establish study ( Appendix 2 ) present moment discharge collect . - Visit 2 : 3 month visit 1 , timeframe three day adjust possible administrative need . - Visit 3 : three month visit 2 , timeframe three day adjust possible administrative need . - Visit 4 : 3 month visit 3 , timeframe three day adjust possible administrative need . - Visit 5 : 3 month visit 4 lead time three day adjust possible administrative need . Statistical treatment The variable study collect Excel table , version 2003 statistical analysis perform use SPSS Windows version 15.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) . Categorical variable describe percentage continuous variable use mean value , standard deviation confidence interval 95 % . In bivariate analysis technique Student 's t-Fisher compare mean Pearson Chi-square linear tendency Mantel-Haenszel comparison proportion Pearson correlation use quantitative variable . Take threshold statistical significance p less 0.05 . A survival study perform . The survival estimate statistical technique Kaplan-Meier determine difference survival group Mantel-Haenszel test use . Variables associate mortality 6 month , use model Cox proportional hazard study . Difficulties limitation study Being population-based study 70 year , main difficulty recruiting , addition perform comprehensive intervention include portion physical activity , investigator exclude patient unfit baseline year . Another difficulty need find nursing staff train supervise exercise home understand significance rating scale test proper completion . Limitations study data population sample may apply Spanish population . Another limitation patient fragility include establish prefrágiles , also could benefit program . Failure system structure communication primary care physicians service `` ad hoc '' emergency study , may decrease effectiveness . Other Considerations Given significant number comorbidities patient multidisciplinary management entail , require numerous clinical guideline proper function study , call ANNEX text 1 Annex 2 , provide ethic committee digital medium ( USB ) towards facilitate valuation . With regard inform consent patient information sheet , provide paper digital format ( USB ) .</detailed_description>
