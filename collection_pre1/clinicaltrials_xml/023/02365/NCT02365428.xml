Flyers available physician ' clinic post and/or handout woman attend first visit ( 8-16 week gestation ) . The PI present study information physician , nurse , staff physician ' site ; however , physician , nurse , staff participate passive recruitment method via study flyer . Participants also recruit nationally use social medium ( i.e. , Facebook , Twitter ) word mouth ( i.e. , email ) .

After complete eligibility questionnaire ( see attach ) , participant contact via email set time complete intake appointment . Intake appointment ( review sign informed consent form , discus study detail ) participant take place phone . The participant ' inform consent baseline questionnaires must receive eligible begin intervention . Participants assign control group ( n=25 ) one two intervention group ( n=50 ) . The control group receive three standard Text4Baby message per week . Intervention group 1 receive two physical activity message one standard Text4Baby message week . Intervention group 2 receive six physical activity message one standard Text4Baby message per week . The physical activity text message refer participant evidence-based ( HON Code certify ) website include PA information relative time pregnancy . Text message pull list 150 possible text message . The text message website provide educational information PA health benefit , woman give prescribed PA program follow part study . Therefore , doctor 's note approve woman 's participation study necessary . All Phase 2 participant objectively measure physical activity use Fitbit activity monitor . The device mail woman complete intake appointment return informed consent baseline questionnaire . The woman wear device 24 hour daily ask sync device computer order send researcher physical activity feedback . All Fitbit monitor identify participant code maintain confidentiality data participant send data via wireless internet researcher receive data .
