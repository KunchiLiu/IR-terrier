	<brief_summary>While therapeutic strategy HER2-positive breast cancer well define , standard strategy HER2-negative tumor . Because lack information related factor affect choice particular treatment strategy , well optimization correct sequence treatment , choice treatment advance disease remain highly empirical may differ significantly among different cancer center . The purpose study observation cohort patient metastatic HER2-negative term : 1. choice chemotherapy treatment start first line treatment ; 2. factor may influence choice ; 3. correlation among characteristic patient ( age , menopausal status , etc . ) type adjuvant metastatic treatment ; 4. clinical outcome ( pattern relapse , time diagnosis , etc . ) ; 5. evaluation adherence literature 's recommendation therapeutic sequence clinical practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observation Medical Treatments MBC HER2-negative Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In particular , attention factor , largely discussed literature , predominantly guide choice among different therapeutic approach : - metastatic site ; - hormone receptor status ; - disease-free interval ; - grading ; - response previous treatment hormonal therapy chemotherapy . The primary objective description medical therapeutic strategy first , second subsequent line chemotherapy cohort patient HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer evaluation possible correlation choice treatment , adjuvant phase metastatic disease also patient ' characteristic ( age , menopausal status , comorbidity ) . secondary objective : - Analyze `` Time Treatment Change '' , define interval time elapse start chemotherapy discontinuation occurrence event . This finding particular clinical relevance , since randomize trial use `` Time To Progression '' ( TTP ) measure effectiveness treatment study , time parameter may correspond observed clinical practice , revaluation disease conduct preset interval case control clinical trial . - Evaluate correlation characteristic patient choice type chemotherapy . - Assess potential correlation type adjuvant therapy type response obtain first-line treatment answer last therapy line second/third one . - Assess adherence literature 's recommendation ( Consensus Conferences Guide-lines ) choices sequential therapy v combination therapy different line treatment ( first , second , third line ) metastatic disease .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patients HER2negative metastatic breast cancer ( Stage IV ) , receive endocrine therapy metastatic disease candidate firstline chemotherapy treatment year 20142015 ( prospective cohort ) , patient receive treatment first , second subsequentline chemotherapy metastatic disease year 20122013 ( retrospective cohort ) . 2 . Age &gt; 18 year 3 .
