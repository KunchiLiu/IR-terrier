	<brief_title>Fatty Liver Study Patients With Type II Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient type 2 diabetes whose glycemic control accomplish Metformin alone , several option additional hypoglycemic agent . As per recent National guideline least three `` second line '' agent add metformin : thiazolidinediones , Lantus insulin , DPP4 inhibitor . All three approach proven help accomplish goal therapy glycemic control ( HbA1c &lt; 7 % ) clinical trial . Whether one approach superior improve associate non-glycemic metabolic abnormality risk future morbidity mortality patient type 2 diabetes remain matter intense debate . Among abnormality , excessive triglyceride content liver ( fatty liver liver steatosis ) major predictor risk non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ( NASH ) liver cirrhosis . Fatty liver highly prevalent patient type 2 diabetes . There clinical study do determine three therapeutic option superior reduce liver triglyceride content patient type 2 diabetes fatty Liver . Therefore , study propose measure compare effect liver triglyceride content either pioglitazone , lantus insulin , DPP4 inhibitor add metformin patient poorly control type 2 diabetes ( HbA1c &gt; 7.6 % ) fatty liver ( presence `` bright '' liver abdominal ultrasound ) . The primary objective trial measure change hepatic lipid content use three common alternative therapeutic strategy improve glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes control metformin alone .</detailed_description>
