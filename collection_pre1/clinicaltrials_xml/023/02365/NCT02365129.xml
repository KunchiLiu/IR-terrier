	<detailed_description>The energy burn capacity brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) make attractive target antiobesity therapy . Sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) classical regulator BAT ; however , recent finding show pool novel BAT activator sidestep need stimulate SNS . Of interest SNS non-SNS BAT activator sensitive physical exercise , open new horizon opportunity study potential effect exercise-based therapeutic intervention . Moreover , new protein release exercise-stimulated skeletal muscle , irisin , seem play key role brown program white adipose tissue . Most available evidence come animal study , sometimes difficult infer human physiology . To determine whether controlled physical exercise program able facilitate BAT maintenance function , stimulate pre-existing brown precursor induce specific gene program favor white-to-brown adipocyte transformation human clinical relevance . The primary objective ACTIBATE randomize control trial ( RCT ) quantify dose-effect different exercise intensity , i.e . exercise , moderate-intensity vigorous-intensity , BAT activity mass ( primary outcome ) , energy expenditure , thermogenic response test meal , shiver threshold , cardiovascular disease risk factor , young adult . The investigator also obtain biopsy white adipose tissue skeletal muscle analyse expression gene encode protein involve thermogenic machinery . The intervention group train 4-5 days/week ( 60 min per session ) 24-week period . With final aim making exercise program transferable society , basis specific exercise dose ACTIBATE physical activity recommendation adult propose World Health Organization . Since information regard ideal exercise model activate recruit BAT , major objective ACTIBATE evaluate various exercise intensity level fall within current public health recommendation test whether high intensity level provide benefit standard moderate-intensity level . ACTIBATE combine aerobic resistance training .</detailed_description>
