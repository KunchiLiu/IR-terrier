	<brief_summary>A previous study show situ MTZ vaginal gel twice daily effective conventional vaginal gel product sustain cure BV ( 4 week treatment ) ( 80.0 % in-situ gel group compare 47.4 conventional gel group.The current study aim compare efficacy use daily situ MTZ vaginal gel ( 0.8 % ) versus twice-daily conventional MTZ vaginal gel treatment BV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Once Daily In-situ Forming Versus Twice-daily Conventional Metronidazole Vaginal Gels Treatment Bacterial Vaginosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) one frequently diagnose infection woman attend genitourinary clinic . As 50 % case BV asymptomatic , true prevalence condition community uncertain.Metronidazole ( MTZ ) consider drug choice treatment BV . It give either orally locally . Formulations local administration drug include gel suppository . The acceptance suppository lower oral administration drug might cause irritation thus affect patient 's compliance . Moreover , mode administration MTZ significant difference eradication pathogenic bacteria . Among metronidazole gel lactic acid gel , local application , lactic acid gel find efficient safer . The recurrence BV le common patient treat lactic acid gel compare patient treat metronidazole gel . This may attribute inhibition growth lactobacilli MTZ use treatment depend concentration lactobacillus . Intravaginal delivery MTZ treatment BV show improvement clinical symptom patient within 21-30 day start treatment . Unfortunately , vagina recolonized lactobacillus within stated period . The use formulation consist policarbophil-carbopol lactic acid-chitosan mucoadhesive vaginal gel also report found safe . Cure rate follow intravaginal treatment MTZ account 80-90 % end treatment one month end therapy . However , three month end therapy rate relapse overcome 30 % . Persistence adherent bacterial biofilm , contain mostly Gardenerlla vaginalis main reason failure BV treatment . Suppressive treatment MTZ gel investigate variable result . Moreover , long-term treatment MTZ recommend high incidence gastrointestinal adverse reaction , risk peripheral neuropathy , Candida super infection . Although patient know tolerate gel well suppository ointment , direct application gel diseased site vagina might difficult well improper . Therefore , vaginal therapy would significantly improve intravaginally administer drug retain site administration prolong time . The situ form hydrogel stimulus sensitive hydrogel exist aqueous solution administration . When exposed external physical stimulus like heat , undergoes reversible volume-phase transition , immediately turn stand gel contact mucosa .Recently , situ gel drug delivery system investigate convenient dosage form topical application . It 's easy applied vagina accurate dose liquid turn gel even spread . It try proved effectiveness , safety tolerance .</detailed_description>
