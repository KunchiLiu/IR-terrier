	<brief_summary>This protocol describe epos ( ancient greek ( Επος ) `` story '' ) group relate clinical trial aim address one important unsolved challenge prevention colorectal cancer ( one major cancer killer ) ; surveillance patient premalignant polyp large bowel . This project timely large scale colorectal cancer screen programme currently roll Western country . These programme diagnose large number individual premalignant polyp ( adenomas serrate polyp ) . This create diagnostic resource dilemma , optimal surveillance strategy individual reduce future cancer risk currently unknown.. The EPoS trial randomize register 27,500 individual different European country different surveillance colonoscopy interval disentangle effective cost-effective surveillance strategy population . Subjects randomize accord present polyp chracteristics The EPoS I trial randomize patient low-risk adenomas 5 10-year surveillance ; ; EPoS II randomize patient high-risk adenomas 3 5-yearly surveillance ; EPoS III include patient serrated polyp one-arm study surveillance 5 10 year . The primary endpoint three trial incidence colorectal cancer 10 year follow-up . This EPoS trial large polyp surveillance ever conduct . They address clinical problem affect hundred thousand individual Europe US year , large size , thus provide definitive result .</brief_summary>
