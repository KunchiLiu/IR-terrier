	<brief_title>Management Third Stage Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The third stage labor refers period follow complete delivery newborn complete delivery placenta . The length third stage complication affect uterine contractility duration placental separation . The normal duration third stage nulliparous well multiparous woman le 30 minute . There strong evidence support routine administration uterotonic agent prevention post-partum hemorrhage ( PPH ) , order enhance natural uterine contraction third stage labor , thus reduce occurrence PPH 40 % . There joint policy statement International Confederation Midwives ( ICM ) , International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics ( FIGO ) World Health Organization ( WHO ) , recommend active management third stage labor order prevent PPH . active management lead reduction PPH incidence , maternal Hemoglobin &lt; 9g/dL need blood transfusion . ( 4-7 ) . Active management third stage labor involve prophylactic uterotonic treatment , early cord clamp control cord traction deliver placenta . ( 2 ) Oxytocin first agent choice PPH prophylaxis high efficacy low incidence associate side effect . ( 6-9 ) . Cotter et al find use Oxytocin PPH prophylaxis third stage labor decrease rate maternal blood loss great 500 ml approximately 50 % . ( 10 ) . Oxytocin route administration either intravenously ( IV ) intramuscularly ( IM ) , significant difference PPH incidence ( 9 ) . This base pharmacokinetic research 1972 find difference absorption rate rout administration . Since research target question preform . ( 11-12 ) . recent guideline WHO , FIGO ICM recommend use 10 IU Oxytocin IM . ( 4 , 7,13 ) . Previous study investigate effect intra-umbilical vein Oxytocin injection reduce blood loss third stage labor . This route administration direct treatment placental bed uterine wall , result early uterine contraction placental separation . However , limited publish literature available evaluate effect umbilical vein oxytocin injection routine practice active management third stage labor . A prospective , randomize control trial 412 woman find intra-umbilical injection oxytocin alongside active management third stage labor significantly reduce postpartum blood loss duration third stage ( 14 ) . Other uterotonic agent include Syntometrine ( IM ) , Ergometrine ( IM IV ) Misoprostol ( IM ) , use active management third stage labor . However , high quality evidence regard efficacy compare Oxytocin scarce . ( 9-10 )</detailed_description>
