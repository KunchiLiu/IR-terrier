	<brief_summary>For patient kidney failure , live donor kidney transplant ( LDKT ) best treatment option . Unfortunately , Blacks ( vs. non-Blacks ) likely kidney failure less likely receive LDKTs . In study , investigator test intervention design address disparity , perform parallel group , two-arm randomized clinical trial among 500 Black kidney transplant candidate . The main objective study test educational behavioral intervention design increase receipt LDKT among transplant candidate ( person active decease donor kidney transplant wait list ) Black . Our overall hypothesis multi-component intervention administer Black transplant candidate increase readiness pursue LDKT actual receipt LDKTs . The investigator randomly assign kidney transplant candidate kidney transplant wait list either : ( 1 ) control group receive Usual Care , ( 2 ) Intervention group receive group-based intervention , well monthly mailing follow-up phone call transplant educator .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Increasing Kidney Transplant Among Blacks Transplant Waiting List</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The best treatment severe chronic kidney disease usually live donor kidney transplant ( LDKT ) , large racial disparity persist receipt LDKTs . In 2011 , Blacks , comprise 36.8 % dialysis population , receive 32.2 % decease donor kidney transplant ( DDKTs ) 14.0 % LDKTs . Among kidney transplant candidate Black , low rate LDKT largely stem lack donor volunteer ( person interested donate live kidney ) . The effective way motivate help Black transplant candidate `` recruit '' identify ( ) donor volunteer remain unclear . Several intervention appear promise test , none proven practical effective . Transplant candidate , particularly Black , report multiple barrier prevent receive LDKTs . These barrier include minimal knowledge LDKT ; fear donor ' future health ; guilt ; medical mistrust ; discomfort discus LDKT family friend . Most transplant candidate never meet either kidney donor recipient transplant LDKT . A multi-component intervention efficiently address barrier could plausibly increase receipt LDKT among Blacks . The main objective study test educational behavioral intervention design increase receipt LDKT among transplant candidate ( person active DDKT wait list ) Black . Our overall hypothesis multi-component intervention administer Black transplant candidate increase readiness pursue LDKT actual receipt LDKTs . To meet objective test hypothesis , propose two-arm , parallel group randomize trial among 500 Black kidney transplant candidate . After Black transplant candidate place wait list DDKT , randomize either : ( 1 ) control group receive Usual Care , ( 2 ) Intervention group receive group-based intervention well monthly mailing follow-up phone call transplant educator . Participants randomize Intervention ask attend , small group family friend , 60-90 minute seminar feature brief talk regard : ●basic fact CKD , transplant , wait list ; ●the experience receiving LDKT transplant ( Black LDKT recipient ) ; ●the experience serve live kidney donor ( Black live kidney donor ) ; ●strategies increase chance get transplant sooner . Our Specific Aims follow : Aim 1 ( Primary Aim ) : To compare readiness pursue LDKT receipt LDKT Intervention vs. Usual Care group randomize clinical trial , 18 month randomization Hypothesis : Exposure multi-component Intervention associate increase readiness pursue LDKT increase receipt LDKT Aim 2 : To determine baseline social behavioral variable modify effect Intervention upon readiness pursue LDKT actual receipt LDKT Hypothesis : Greater knowledge LDKT great readiness pursue LDKT associate receipt LDKT Aim 3 : To determine whether change social behavioral variable mediate effect Intervention upon readiness pursue LDKT actual receipt LDKT Hypothesis : Increases readiness pursue LDKT associate receipt LDKT</detailed_description>
