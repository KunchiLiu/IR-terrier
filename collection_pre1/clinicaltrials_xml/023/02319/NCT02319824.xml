	<brief_summary>This pilot , phase I trial study safety cancer-testis antigen ( NY-ESO-1 ) -specific T cell ( type immune cell ) treat patient NY-ESO-1-expressing sarcomas spread place body receive palliative ( relief symptom suffer caused cancer ) radiation therapy . Placing modified gene NY-ESO-1 white blood cell may help body build immune response kill tumor cell express NY-ESO-1 . Palliative radiation therapy may help patient advanced sarcoma live comfortably . Giving NY-ESO-1-specific T cell follow palliative radiation therapy may better treatment patient sarcomas .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NY-ESO-1-Specific T-cells Treating Patients With Advanced NY-ESO-1-Expressing Sarcomas Receiving Palliative Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety toxicity NY-ESO-1-specific T cell give follow high-dose , hypo-fractionated palliative radiation patient advance NY-ESO-1 express sarcoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To look preliminary evidence systemic efficacy NY-ESO-1-specific T-cell therapy follow radiation non-radiated tumor . II . To determine whether radiation increase traffic adoptively transfer NY-ESO-1-specific T cell compare tumor biopsy specimen radiate non-radiated tumor . OUTLINE : Patients undergo palliative radiation therapy discretion treat radiation oncologist . Patients receive NY-ESO-1-specific T cell intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute 2-3 day completion radiation therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow weekly 2 week , 4-6 , 8 , 10 , 12 week , 6 month .</detailed_description>
