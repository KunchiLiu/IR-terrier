	<brief_summary>The investigator already proven absolute total thyroidectomy give elimination anti-TPO antibody . Our hypothesis elimination also eliminate typical Hashimoto symptom , namely : Serious tiredness , increase need sleep , pain musculature joint dryness eye mouth . The prerequisite effect absolute total thyroidectomy . There exist treatment eliminate antibody . The study randomize operation ordinary conservative medical treatment thyroxine control supplementation . The symptom group evaluate 5 different Quality Life scheme , internationally approve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study hypothesis elimination anti-TPO antibody ameliorate typical Hashimoto symptom like tiredness , increase need sleep , pain musculature joint dryness eye mouth . It necessary absolute total thyroidectomy perform . We prove effect antibody , also proven operation procedure perform without complication like recurrent nerve damage hypocalcemia . Neutrality secure randomization do neutral institution , laryngoscopy neutral doctor instruction fill QoL-schemes perform non-biased study nurse . The study run least 18 month control every 6 month . Blood sample take international approved QoL-schemes fill . In addition randomise main group side group patient fulfil 2 3 inclusion criterion follow parallel order elucidate spontaneous development disease show critical value antibody make symptom turn .</detailed_description>
