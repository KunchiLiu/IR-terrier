	<brief_title>Topical Clobetasol Treatment Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experimental focus trial thus evaluate safety clinical outcome topical steroid ( clobetasol 0.05 % ointment ) treatment cutaneous manifestation toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) . The design study randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind split-body Phase II clinical trial clobetasol 0.05 % placebo ointment topically apply opposite arm period fourteen day . The primary endpoint study determine time cessation skin detachment group well safety topical clobetasol treat cutaneous manifestation TEN . Secondary outcome measure evaluate efficacy comparing time re-epithelialization percentage affect skin clobetasol placebo arm various time point . An additional aim study characterize gene express TEN disease state change gene expression follow treatment topical steroid , particularly gene involve regulation program cell death ( apoptosis ) . This accomplish though molecular analysis skin biopsy specimen obtain treatment clobetasol placebo ointment . The specific hypothesis test two week topical clobetasol promote epidermal keratinocyte survival suppression TNF signaling , decrease granulysin expression inhibition pro-apoptotic pathway result short disease duration decrease time re-epithelialization .</detailed_description>
