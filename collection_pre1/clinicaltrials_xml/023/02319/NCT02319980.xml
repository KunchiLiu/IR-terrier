	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate whether extracranial-intracranial ( EC-IC ) bypass surgery could prevent rebleeding improve neurological function adult moyamoya hemorrhagic onset .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Adult Hemorrhagic Moyamoya Surgery Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About one half adult moyamoya patient present hemorrhagic onset.As bleed event potentially fatal , often lead particularly poor prognosis.However , natural history still poorly understood.Although rebleeding rate know extremely high , effective therapeutic method establish base worldwide consensus . The recently publish Japanese Adult Moyamoya ( JAM ) Trial , first prospective , randomize , control trial focus hemorrhagic moyamoya , show direct bypass surgery could reduce rebleeding rate improve prognosis.However , result statistically marginal small sample size importantly , fail assess neurological function.The effect bypass surgery functional outcome uncertain . Therefore , AHMSS study China design compare efficacy safety EC-IC bypass surgery conservative treatment adult moyamoya patient hemorrhagic onset comprehensive assessment rebleeding rate , neurological function .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Independent activity daily living ( The modify Rankin Scale 02 ) 2 . At least one month since recent hemorrhagic stroke 3 . The neurological deficit must stable 6 week 4 . Bleeding ventricle , cortex , basal ganglion , thalamus subarachnoid space confirm computed tomography plain scan 5 . Digital substraction angiography demonstrate progressive stenosis occlusion terminal portion internal carotid artery and/or initial portion anterior middle cerebral artery 6 . Digital substraction angiography demonstrate formation abnormal collateral network ( moyamoya vessel ) base brain , mainly region thalamus basal ganglia 7 . Digital substraction angiography demonstrate vasculopathy appear unilaterally bilaterally 8 . Competent give inform consent 9 . Accessible reliable followup 1 . Other cerebrovascular disease ( intracranial aneurysm brain arteriovenous malformation ) probably cause intracranial hemorrhage 2 . Not independent activity daily living ( The modify Rankin Scale 35 ) 3 .
