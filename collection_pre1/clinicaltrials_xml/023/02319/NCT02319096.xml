	<brief_title>Vibration Training Pelvic Floor Muscle Strength Females With Stress Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic floor muscle training ( PFMT ) first line therapy recommend NICE treatment SUI . It first describe Arnold Kegel almost 60 year ago . PFMT exercise help patient strengthen muscle pelvic floor repeat high-intensity , rapid pelvic muscle contraction slow fast twitch muscle fibre . The training muscle difficult particularly woman trouble perception PFM . This result poor motivation compliance Cochrane review suggest 15-20 % woman comply regimen . Whole body vibration ( WBV ) exercise develop new modality field physiotherapy . Whole body vibration ( WBW ) positive effect muscle strength rate force . Stochastic WBV cause 12 muscle contraction per second achieve routine PFM exercise supervision physiotherapist . The Galileo machine unique device apply whole-body vibration . The investigator aim audit treatment whole body vibration . This would do use patient global impression improvement scale ( PGI-I ) routine quality life symptom questionnaire ( International Consultation Incontinence Female low Urinary Tract Symptoms Questionnaire -ICIQ-FLUTS Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory - PFDI ) complete patient initial appointment 12 week treatment pelvic floor muscle assessment carry initial appointment 12 week . Patients also qualitative interview Urogynaecology team ass therapy find suitable acceptable patient .</detailed_description>
