	<brief_summary>There accumulate evidence suggest inflammatory process , microglial activation , would play key role neurodegenerative process Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . It consider microglial activation would part self-propelling cycle neuroinflammation fuel progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration . It however hard evidence microglial activation vivo , especially substantia nigra : first , investigator need high resolution imaging tool , ligand available date , 11C-PK11195 , low sensitivity specificity provide heterogeneous result . 18F-DPA-714 new PET ligand label microglial cell . The investigator aim explore topography intensity microglial activation several different group PD patient : 1 ) de novo , drug-na√Øve subject ( n = 6 ) ; 2 ) non-fluctuating treated patient ( `` honeymoon '' ) ( n = 10 ) ; 3 ) advance drug-responsive patient motor fluctuation ( wearing-off dyskinesia ) ( n = 6 ) ; 4 ) patient LRRK2 gene mutation ( n = 6 ) ; 5 ) relate healthy patient carrier mutation LRRK2 ( n = 6 ) . PET image perform new generation tomography high resolution . This study might reveal significant neuroinflammatory process midbrain PD patient determine process present sporadic genetic form PD . The result study might provide new biomarker disease pathological progression help identify subject might benefit specific anti-inflammatory drug .</brief_summary>
