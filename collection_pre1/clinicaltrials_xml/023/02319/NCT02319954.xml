	<brief_summary>Periorbital edema ecchymosis common morbidity post-operative period rhinoplasty . Lateral osteotomy technique use reshape bony nasal pyramid large contribute factor degree bruise edema . This due injury angular vessel cross osteotomy site . Depending degree swell bruising , cause difficulty visual acuity early post-operative period . Most importantly , quite distress patient impact time required return normal social activity . Numerous study examine various intervention reduce periorbital swell ecchymosis . These include peri-operative steroid , lidocaine epinephrine injection , fibrin sealant , permissive intra-operative hypotension subperiosteal osteotomy technique . Peri-operative steroid extensively study . Recent meta-analysis Hatef et al , find pre-operative steroid effective decrease post-operative edema ecchymosis . Steroids however , carry risk psychosis , immunosuppression , weight gain , uncontrolled blood glucose avascular necrosis hip . As , broadly applicable cost-effective technique minimize post-operative edema ecchymosis without risk profile steroid would ideal . Taskin et al . recently examine efficacy combination intraoperative cold saline-soaked gauze compression corticosteroid rhinoplasty morbidity . The study group receive compression cold saline soak gauze nasal dorsum surgery control group receive compression dry gauze . Both group receive pre-operative dose intravenous steroid . The study group significantly less periorbital edema ecchymosis post-operative day 1 , 3 , 5 7 . This study unfortunately examine role compression alone study perform presence steroid , routinely utilized surgeon . As , propose study provide evidence use direct compression intra-operatively lateral osteotomy order reduce post-operative edema ecchymosis . The finding study may provide simple , effective non-costly technique minimize morbidity rhinoplasty .</brief_summary>
