	<brief_summary>Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) refer two chronic disease ( Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis ) affect intestine . The number new case IBD people young 16 year old increase United Kingdom ( UK ) , currently estimate 700 new case every year . There cure IBD patient experience episodes flareups period wellbeing . Traditionally , child IBD ask attend regular hospital appointment . This mean , even well , get hospital involve travel long distance . Telephone consultation show beneficial area medicine approach well studied child . The aim study determine whether telephone consultation would improve quality life , patient satisfaction , proportion consultation attend whether would safe reduce cost patient National Health Service ( NHS ) . Investigators plan randomise controlled trial involve 92 participant recruit amongst 250 child adolescent age 8 16 year attend regional paediatric IBD centre Manchester . Half assign telephone consultation , half face face consultation . The study would approval local ethic committee participant would provide write consent . Investigators compare outcomes two group 2 year . If telephone consultation prove effective , NHS could offer child IBD choice either telephone consultation face face consultation outpatient followup .

	<brief_title>Telephone Consultation Substitute Routine Out-patient Face-to-face Consultation Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESIS Telephone consultation effective , safe , cost-effective alternative traditional routine face-to-face consultation child adolescent IBD . AIMS The specific aim study : 1 . To determine telephone consultation , compare face-to-face consultation effective child adolescent IBD . The investigator hypothesise compare face-face-consultations , telephone consultation would : 1. improve patient ' health-related quality life 2. positive impact patient/carer satisfaction consultation 3. reduce out-patient non-attendance rate 2 . To determine adverse event associate routine telephone consultation child adolescent IBD . The investigator hypothesise compare face-to-face consultation , telephone consultation : 1. adversely affect patient ' disease course number relapse , number hospital admission , number time visit paediatrician General Practitioner ( GP ) concern symptom 2. adversely affect child 's growth 3 . To compare NHS resource utilisation , cost NHS cost patient carers two group . The investigator hypothesise telephone consultation , compare face-to-face consultation , : 1. reduce NHS resource use 2. reduce out-patient non-attendance rate 3. cost-effective NHS 4. reduce IBD-related cost patient family . METHODS SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS The study base Royal Manchester Children 's Hospital , regional Paediatric Gastroenterology referral centre . Children adolescents IBD North West England beyond refer centre . Any patient age 8 16 year diagnosis IBD eligible entry trial . Eligible patient identify hospital 's paediatric IBD database . There currently 250 eligible patient attend centre . Inclusion criterion : patient age 8 16 year ; diagnosis IBD establish clinical , endoscopic , histological radiological criterion ; clinical remission define abbreviated Paediatric Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( aPCDAI ) score ≤10 ( 12 ) patient Crohn 's disease Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index ( PUCAI ) score &lt; 10 ( 13 ) ulcerative colitis indeterminate colitis ; parental child 's consent participate study . Exclusion criterion active disease ( aPCDAI &gt; 15 PUCAI ≥15 ) , unwillingness provide inform consent . STUDY DESIGN A randomise control trial compare telephone consultation standard face-to-face out-patient consultation . It accompany economic evaluation . PLAN OF STUDY The investigator send letter invitation participate study research information sheet outline nature importance study eligible patient parent . The invitation letter explicitly state wish take part study , prejudice quality health care provision hospital . Two week later , investigator telephone already respond , offer invitation participate answer query . Those contacted telephone send second letter . Those agree take part interview investigator provide full information trial obtain write informed consent . Prior randomization , follow baseline demographic clinical feature record : patient 's initial , date birth , gender , hospital number , disease activity ( aPCDAI PUCAI score ) . Participants provide contact detail relevant investigator . Randomization By mean computer-generated random number , participant randomly allocate one two group : Intervention Group : telephone consultation Control Group : face-to-face consultation The investigator use stratified block randomization block random size , stratify type disease ( i.e.Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis/indeterminate colitis ) . To ensure allocation concealment , computer-generated assignment schedule hold centrally administer 2 designated administrator involve study . If participant meet inclusion criterion provide informed consent , enter study . Investigators telephone designate administrator , record patient 's identification number , date birth disease activity score , assign next number series determine allocation group . The assigned group record implement . Nobody able alter assignment . Participants telephone group , however , retain option return routine care non-concordance allocate intervention . Procedures Patients group offer out-patient appointment date time . Those randomized face-to-face follow attend appointment hospital usual . Those randomized telephone consultation tell expect call gastroenterology doctor time appointment ( school hour ) . The consult doctor contact patient parent via telephone number ( home mobile ) parent patient previously supply number would like contact . As much possible , parent patient advise together time appointment order allow participate consultation usual practice . Up 3 attempt within 20 minute make contact patient phone . Details consultation include date time , present , duration consultation , fail attempt phone call record . Patients `` DNA '' appointment either group send another appointment accordance normal practice . Apart randomise telephone face-to-face consultation , routine care patient group . For instance , patient treatment azathioprine methotrexate continue relevant test full blood count liver function test monitor regularly accord current guideline . In current practice , routine monitoring usually take place routine out-patient visit rather child 's GP surgery , local hospital result communicate inflammatory bowel disease nurse specialist . This practice remain patient . It also emphasize , normal practice , participant experience symptom cause concern time study , parent/child contact IBD nurse advice appropriate arrangement assessment make . A relapse require withdrawal patient see treat appropriate remain study group . OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome measure The primary outcome measure change paediatric IBD-specific health-related quality life ( QOL ) score . QOL score assess baseline , 6-monthly 2-year follow-up period use validated paediatric IBD QOL IMPACT questionnaire ( Appendix 1 ) . The IMPACT questionnaire originally develop use paediatric IBD Canada ( 14 ) minor adaptation , questionnaire subsequently validate Canada ( ( 15 ) , Netherlands ( 16 ) , UK ( 17 ) . The questionnaire consist 35 question measure six quality life domain ( IBD symptom , systemic symptom , emotional functioning , social functioning , body image , treatment/interventions ) utilize Likert scale report patient 's answer . Responses score ( 0 4 ) sum give total score ( range 0 140 ) . Higher score represent good QOL . Secondary outcome measure 1 . Relapses For participant , number relapse study period record . For patient Crohn 's disease , relapse define aPCDAI &gt; 15 . The PCDAI originally develop validated several centre ( 18 ) use widely paediatric clinical trial . The original PCDAI include three history item ( abdominal pain , number liquid stool , general wellbeing ) , five physical examination item ( abdominal examination , perirectal disease , extraintestinal manifestation , weight , height velocity ) , three laboratory test ( hematocrit , albumin , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ) . Among thing , original PCDAI criticize inclusion blood test . Recent study show abbreviated version PCDAI ( aPCDAI ) omit laboratory item accurate predicted disease activity well original PCDAI ( 12,19 ) . The aPCDAI consist three history item ( abdominal pain , number liquid stool , general well-being ) , three physical examination item ( weight loss , abdominal examination , perirectal disease ) original PCDAI . In order avoid repeat blood sample research purpose , use aPCDAI ( Appendix II ) . Items index score three-point scale ( zero , 5 , 10 point ) score range zero 60 high score indicate active disease . For patient ulcerative colitis indeterminate colitis , PUCAI score &gt; 15 consider relapse . The PUCAI validate instrument include six history item ( abdominal pain , rectal bleeding , stool consistency , nocturnal stool activity level ) ( 13 ) . PUCAI score range zero 85 high score indicate active disease . 2 . Basic anthropometric measure every routine follow visit / consultation Weight height measure baseline routine follow appointment group . For allocated face face consultation , height weight measure out-patients visit . For child allocate telephone consultation , height weight measure local paediatric service , prior telephone appointment . A member study team , prior follow period , contact telephone consultation group remind measurement do . A study team member contact local service parent / patient obtain measurement . Height body mass index ( BMI ) z score calculate base sex- age-related UK centile chart . 3 . Patient satisfaction consultation - complete every Participants carers ask complete Consultation Satisfaction Questionnaire ( CSQ ) end consultation . This CSQ 18 item consultation-specific satisfaction measure develop validate Baker ( 20 , 21 ) . It since use areas/settings include community nursing ( 22 , 23 ) , recently modify test use consultation involve patient age 15 year young ( 24 ) . After discussion originator instrument researcher modify paediatric use , modify version CSQ adapt child age 15 year young ( Appendix IIa ) , original version adapt patient age 16 year old ( Appendix IIb ) { R Baker P Kinnersley , personal communication , July 2008 } . 4 . Number hospital admission IBD 24 month . Data obtain patient 's hospital record . 5 . Proportion out-patient consultation attend For group , proportion outpatient appointment attend 24-month follow-up period calculate divide total number appointment ( telephone face-to-face ) offer number appointment attend . 6 . Duration consultations The duration consultation record patient 's medical note . 7 . Adverse effect immuno-suppressive agent azathioprine methotrexate . Any adverse effect immuno-suppressive agent participant may receive study period record . 8 . Economic evaluation Investigators assess use health care resource , cost NHS cost patient carers two group . Data resource use tertiary , secondary primary care collect . Data resource use outpatient consultation ( telephone face-to-face ) , additional unscheduled hospital visit , test procedure , drug prescription , hospital admission , general practice visit identify every patient . At outpatient consultation ( telephone face-to-face ) , clinician record detail consultation include date visit duration consultation . Abortive telephone call record well face-to-face appointment miss . For telephone consultation , note whether call local , national , make mobile phone . Data inpatient admission , investigation procedure , treatment receive abstracted patient 's hospital record . A patient/carer diary ( Appendix IV ) use collect information drug utilisation ( name , dose , frequency , duration ) , GP visit , care receive hospital . Patients ask complete diary every time visit GP , change regular medication , see hospital . Diary information collate 6-monthly . Resource use clearly unrelated IBD exclude economic evaluation . Note : Routine follow ups / consultation vary patient depend well . Patients may also see routine appointment schedule study follow ups .</detailed_description>
