	<brief_summary>Many Indonesian infant already iron deficient reach age six month , also determine high prevalence anemia among under-five child . Iron deficiency ultimately lead anemia , clear evidence iron deficiency anemia early childhood mark negative effect child development cognitive function ( Lozoff et al.1991 ; Idjradinata &amp; Pollitt , 1993 ) . This negative impact childhood development one main reason iron deficiency infancy prevent treat . Since diet low iron usually also low zinc , zinc deficiency -- negative consequence growth -- common iron deficiency area . In Southeast Asia , condition exacerbate rich phytate content complementary food inhibits absorption iron well zinc ( Gibson , 1994 ) . Thus , combine iron zinc , hence , expect decrease iron zinc deficiency hence improve growth development child . Recently , emerge view look two-way relationship nutrition , health , psychosocial well-being . This concept support study `` positive deviance '' , term use refer child grow develop well impoverished environment child victim malnutrition chronic illness ( Zeitlin et al. , 1990 ) . The mechanism help explain psychosocial factor , affect mother child , associated adequate growth development : 'Psychological stress negative effect use nutrient whereas psychological well-being stimulates secretion growth-promoting hormone . Pleasantly stimulate interaction enhance child 's tendency exercise develop organ system hence utilize nutrient growth development ' . Understanding psychosocial environment promote inhibit benefit supplementation intervention necessary order well way set provide supplement . In fact , many supplementation program incorporate complementary program element would help improve health psychosocial development child time improve nutritional status ' ( Myers , 1995 ) . Looking perspective , supplementation benefit psychosocial development also psychosocial environment promote benefit supplementation nutritional status developmental outcomes infant . The purpose study investigate whether multi-micronutrient supplementation ( zinc+iron , zinc+iron+vit.A ) positive effect infant ' growth developmental outcome , whether effect modify psychosocial care .</brief_summary>
