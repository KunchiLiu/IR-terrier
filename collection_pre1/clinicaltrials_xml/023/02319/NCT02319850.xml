	<brief_summary>Sarcopenia age-related loss muscle mass may affect 25 % individual age 60 result 3 4 time increase likelihood develop disability . Despite observation , sarcopenia rarely subject systematic screening process part customary geriatric care . Furthermore , lean body mass ( LBM ) measure via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) old adult , typically within reactive , hospital-based , model healthcare muscle waste assessed loss functional independence . The investigator propose affordable , portable screen method ultrasound image perform primary care setting . The investigator long term goal identify individual risk , intervene treatment may prevent onset debilitating loss muscle function elderly .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Muscle Ultrasound Sarcopenia Leading Early Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : The overall goal pilot project validate rapid , portable , cost-effective , sarcopenia identification method use diagnostic sonography . This method would use screen aid early detection , diagnosis clinical setting , monitor effect formal intervention . The investigator central hypothesis sonographic muscle characteristic significantly associate estimate lean body mass ( LBM ) functional status . Research Setting : George Washington University , Exercise Science Laboratory . Participants : Subjects include healthy young reference group ( 18 - 29 year age ) old comparison group ( 55 - 75 year age ; n = 15 per group ; approximately 50 % female ) , consecutively recruit George Washington University surround community . Implications/Significance : Diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound portable , inexpensive modality suitable bedside use community health initiative , feature exposure low-dose radiation . It important note DXA consider relatively low cost procedure , DXA-based measure may continue use standard sarcopenia syndrome LBM criterion . Consequently , study examine LBM value obtain ultrasound may serve viable proxy LBM measure obtain DXA . The innovation investigator study reflect proactive approach sarcopenia screen responsive grow shift healthcare hospital alternative , community-based setting .</detailed_description>
