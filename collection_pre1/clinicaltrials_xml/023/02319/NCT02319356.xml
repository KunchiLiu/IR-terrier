	<brief_title>Does Dietary Nitrate Supplementation Improve Aerobic Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dietary nitrate supplementation show enhance exercise tolerance performance professional athlete physically active male . Cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) establish , non invasive safe method assess patient ' cardiopulmonary reserve prior surgery . It show predict complication length stay patient undergo major elective surgery . The anaerobic threshold ( AT ) , oxygen uptake anaerobic ATP synthesis supplement aerobic ATP synthesis maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) point oxygen uptake plateau despite increase work rate ; calculate CPET ; show predict short long term outcome surgery postoperative complication . We aim study effect dietary nitrate supplementation CPET result patient await surgery colorectal cancer . Our primary outcome change AT VO2Max beetroot juice supplementation . Methods : Patients undergo initial CPET randomize receive either beetroot juice ( BRJ , contain NO3- , 6.2 mmol/day , administer 500ml Beet Sport Shots , James White drink , Ipswich uk ) 'placebo ' ( PL , NO3-depleted beetroot juice ) 7 day . A second CPET perform . This pilot study use calculate mean AT VO2Max associate standard deviation population approximate effect BRJ .</detailed_description>
