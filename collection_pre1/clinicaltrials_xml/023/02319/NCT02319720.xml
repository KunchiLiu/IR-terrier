	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Bone Marrow Cells Treatment Chronic Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior randomization subject screen HIV , Hepatitis B Hepatitis C. Women child bear age test pregnancy . As primarily safety study , electrocardiogram do start study baseline order document potential change later date . After initial randomization visit subject return wound examine week 17 week treatment cycle begin wound heals , whichever early . Up 4 treatment cycle allow . As soon wound completely heal , subject return month 6 month certain wound remain heal . The duration subject wound participation study expect maximum 18 month follow start study treatment . The subject study randomize one four arm . Three group receive bone marrow cell one receive bone marrow cell ( control group ) . 1 . Bone Marrow Aspirate ( BMA ) Plus Cultured Cells Group : The subject arm study fresh bone marrow aspirate administer wound time bone marrow take . Part aspirate culture . Once cell culture mature ( within 8 week ) check sterility , frozen apply wound . Up three application culture cell apply wound follow bone marrow biopsy . A single treatment cycle consist one application freshly obtain bone marrow aspirate three application culture cell derive aspirate . If wound heal , three additional treatment cycle may perform . Each bone marrow biopsy follow direct application fresh bone marrow wind three application culture cell ( prepared recent bone marrow biopsy ) . If wound heals point protocol , additional bone marrow biopsy procedure perform additional cell apply . 2 . Cultured Cells Alone Group : In group , bone marrow aspirate send laboratory grown tissue culture . Once cell culture mature ( within 8 week ) check sterility frozen apply subject wound . Up three application culture cell apply wound follow bone marrow biopsy . A single treatment cycle consist three application culture cell derive single bone marrow aspiration . If wound heal , three additional treatment cycle may perform . Each bone marrow biopsy follow three application culture cell ( prepared recent bone marrow biopsy ) . If wound heal point protocol , additional bone marrow biopsy procedure perform additional cell apply . 3 . Bone Marrow Aspirate Alone Group : The subject group fresh bone marrow aspirate administer wound time bone marrow take . A single treatment cycle consist one application freshly obtain bone marrow aspirate . If wound heal , three additional bone marrow biopsy may perform . If wound heals point protocol , additional bone marrow biopsy procedure perform additional cell apply . 4 . Control Group The subject group receive currently approve treatment wound . These treatment include debridement dressing change . Wound dressing allow include gauze , foam dressing , occlusive film , non-stick pad . More advanced dressing material hydrocolloid , alginates , silver contain dressing , biomaterials also use . Compression utilize low extremity wound . VISIT SCHEDULING ; Regardless group subject assign , he/she ask return weekly Standard Of Care ( SOC ) wound evaluation . Subjects miss 4 consecutive weekly visit receive SOC elsewhere , may remove study . After ( wound closure occur early ) subject return month 6 month evaluation . Follow-up study visit arrange 1 4 week interval base clinical evaluation schedule restriction wound heals . Once wound determine heal , subject ask return monthly 6 month certain wound remain heal . Subjects non-healing wound monitor 6 month follow last administration bone marrow cell . Lower extremity wound cover compression bandage . If wound locate low extremity , cover nonstick pad , adsorbent pad , gauze wrap , optionally , light compression bandage . Subjects diabetic wound ask submit record blood sugar monitoring . The blood level Hemoglobin A1c also monitor three-month interval already do routinely . If Hemoglobin A1c level 10 % , physician manage subject diabetes contact discuss change medication control subject diabetes . All study examination include observation healing , wound trace measurement photography wound . All subject skin biopsy take time heal week 17 end treatment cycle visit . Tissues derive debridement procedure also collect .</detailed_description>
