	<brief_summary>This project study impulsive side effect common treatment Parkinson 's Disease . By learn part brain involve Parkinson 's encode information relate reward motivation , investigator better understand reason Parkinson 's patient often suffer compulsive gambling , hypersexuality , repetitive tinkering ( `` punding '' ) . These result may lead design good method deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) minimize behavioral side effect Parkinson 's treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While typical treatment Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , dopaminergic drug deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) , proven effective mitigate motor deficit associate disease , method also give rise behavioral side effect include compulsive gambling , hypersexuality , complex , purposeless stereotype behavior ( `` punding '' ) . And much work investigate underlying pattern neural activity give rise tremor , rigidity , motor effect D , little known neural genesis impulsive side effect human . The investigator propose characterize pattern neural activity underlie failure impulse control actual PD patient population undergo surgery implantation DBS electrodes . Such procedure offer unique opportunity collect data single neuron level human , since surgeon rely intraoperative electrophysiology identify anatomical boundary subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) , typical target DBS PD . Using multi-channel Ad-Tech microwire array , investigator simultaneously record multiple channel single unit activity ( spikes field potential ) STN nearby structure subject perform cognitive task validate link impulsivity human population . In balloon analogue risk task ( BART ) participant must balance risk reward decide stop inflate computerized balloon whose point value risk pop grow size . In stop signal reaction task ( SSRT ) , participant must respond quickly possible `` go '' cue appear , countermand response `` stop '' tone play . At neural level , BART allow u elucidate correlate risk , outcome ( reward aversive ) , anticipation , SSRT , well-studied model impulsivity animal model human strong link computational model , allow u determine single unit network-level pattern activity underlie failure impulse control . Through experiment , well computational modeling , investigator characterize neural correlate impulsivity PD patient allow design DBS protocols mitigate impulsive side effect . The R21 mechanism use develop streamline process multichannel record cognitive test intraoperative set validate hypothesize link single neuron activity model behavior stop signal task .</detailed_description>
