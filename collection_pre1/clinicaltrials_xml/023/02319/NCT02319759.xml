	<detailed_description>This multi-center ( one clinical site work medical research study ) , randomize ( study medication assign participant chance ) , double-blind ( neither investigator participant know treatment participant receives ) , placebo-controlled ( placebo inactive substance compare drug test whether drug real effect clinical trial ) study determine efficacy safety guselkumab participant PsA . The study consist 4 part : Screening period ( 6 week ) , double-blind treatment period ( consist guselkumab placebo treatment 24 week ) , active treatment period ( guselkumab 20 week ) , follow-up period ( 12 week ) . The maximal study duration participant exceed 62 week include Screening period . Eligible participant randomly assign one two group 2:1 ratio either receive Guselkumab 100 milligram ( mg ) Weeks 0 , 4 every 8 week Placebo Weeks 0 , 4 every 8 week Week 24 . At week 24 , participant remain placebo group start receive guselkumab 100 mg Weeks 24 , 28 , 36 44 .
