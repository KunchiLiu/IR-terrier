	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose alisertib give together combination chemotherapy treat patient gastrointestinal tumor . Alisertib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving alisertib one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may better treatment gastrointestinal tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alisertib Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Gastrointestinal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerated dos recommend phase II dose modify fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin ( mFOLFOX ) give combination alisertib ( MLN8237 ) patient gastrointestinal cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe anti-tumor activity associate treatment . II . To assess baseline tumor expression immunohistochemistry aurora kinase A ( AURKA ) , v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( AKT ) , phosphorylated ( phospho ) -AKT ( serine [ Ser ] 473 ) , tumor protein p53 ( p53 ) , tumor protein p73 ( p73 ) , beta ( b ) -catenin , v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog ( avian ) ( c-MYC ) , cleave caspase 3 . III . To assess baseline messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression AURKA , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , c-MYC , human double minute 2 ( HDM2 ) , cyclin D1 ( CCND1 ) , correlate response therapy . IV . To obtain post-treatment biopsy specimen confirm target inhibition assay AURKA , phosphorylated ( p ) AURKA T288 , p53 , p73 , MYC , HDM2 , cleave caspase 3 . V. To perform quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) post-treatment specimen AURKA oncogenic target : p53-regulated apoptosis induce protein 1 ( p53AIP1 ) , VEGF , HDM2 , MYC . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study alisertib . Patients receive alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-3 mFOLFOX regimen comprise oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 2 , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 2 , fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 2-4 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
