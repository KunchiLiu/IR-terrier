	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effect , good bad , add low dose fractionate radiation therapy ( LDFRT ) pelvis , FOLFOX chemotherapy prior surgery . Standard pelvic radiation therapy give day ( Monday Friday ) approximately 5.5 week give study . You receive 6 cycle FOLFOX ( cycle 2 week ) also get LDFRT pelvis give twice day first two day cycle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pelvic Radiotherapy With Concurrent Neoadjuvant FOLFOX Patients With Newly Diagnosed Rectal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current standard care treatment locally advanced rectal cancer consist neoadjuvant whole pelvic RT radiosensitizing single-agent 5-FU follow surgery adjuvant full dose chemotherapy ( typically FOLFOX ) . For clinical T3 , T4 , and/or lymph node positive rectal cancer patient standard neoadjuvant radiation dose per fraction 180 cGy deliver consecutive weekday 5.5 week total 5040 cGy . A potentially paradigm-changing approach currently investigate phase II/III trial neoadjuvant RT omit favor use full dose FOLFOX chemotherapy base provocative data publish Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center . We hypothesize whole pelvic LDFRT use 40 cGy fraction total 960 cGy safely add concurrently neoadjuvant full dose FOLFOX alternative standard neoadjuvant 5-FU chemoradiation . We hypothesize use LDFRT chemopotentiatior significantly increase pCR rate report Memorial Sloan Kettering pilot study 27 % . Lastly , due significantly low radiation dose per fraction lower total radiation dose expect novel strategy cause high rate severe toxicity compare neoadjuvant FOLFOX alone . Specifically , phase II trial intend determine whether 6 cycle neoadjuvant FOLFOX concurrent LDFRT follow comprehensive restaging TME achieve favorable outcome patient T3N0M0 , T3N1M0 , T2N1M0 rectal cancer . As mention , current standard care locally advance rectal cancer patient include radiosensitizing 5-FU concurrent whole pelvic RT 5040 Gy 180 Gy daily fraction . Per propose protocol , T3N0M0 , T3N1M0 , T2N1M0 rectal cancer patient eligible undergo low anterior resection would receive whole pelvic RT 960 cGy 40 cGy fraction deliver twice daily day 1-2 cycle FOLFOX chemotherapy total 6 cycle . Eligible study subject include adult candidate curative intent sphincter-sparing surgery lack high-risk feature , particularly tumor encroach upon mesorectal fascia ( within 3 mm ) determine pre-treatment endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) distal rectal tumor ( &lt; 5 cm anal verge ) .</detailed_description>
