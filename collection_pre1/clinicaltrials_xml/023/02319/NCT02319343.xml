	<brief_summary>This study evaluate pathophysiological effect single dose Methylprednisolone administer prior total knee-arthroplasty ( TKA ) . The investigator examine effect thigh muscle function evaluate efficacy Methylprednisolone knee-extension strength discharge TKA . Half participant receive intravenous Solu-Medrol 125 mg , half receive placebo . The investigator hypothesize group receive Methylprednisolone experience small loss knee-extension strength compare placebo-group , early TKA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Methylprednisolone Quadriceps Muscle Function Patients Undergoing Total Knee-arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The anti-inflammatory effect glucocorticoid well know . The beneficial effect postoperative pain , postoperative nausea vomit well-documented . Knee-arthroplasty surgery inflammatory stress response general affect potential recovery . The quadriceps muscle strength show reduce significantly ( 80 % ) early surgery . The mechanism think related inhibitory reflex pain caused surgical induced inflammation around knee joint . The effect glucocorticoid quadriceps muscle function knee-arthroplasty surgery unknown call investigation . The study consider explorative . The primary analysis primary outcome measure comparison change knee extension strength baseline 48 hour postoperatively two group . For calculation sample size average loss strength baseline ( surgery ) 48 hour TKA-surgery 0.8 Nm/kg body weight ( SD=0.39 , Holm et al . 2010 ) , risk type I errors 5 % risk type II errors 20 % ( 80 % power ) use . The sample size estimate reveal group difference knee extension strength minimum 40 % . The primary analysis carry included patient ( intention-to-treat ) baseline value covariate . Secondary exploratory per-protocol analysis might perform . Missing outcome analyse use multiple imputation due expect strong time trend . The secondary outcome measure ; group difference 6 sec . ( Timed Up &amp; Go ) 2 cm ( knee circumference ) consider clinically relevant . The statistical power base calculation outline use test prerequisite .
