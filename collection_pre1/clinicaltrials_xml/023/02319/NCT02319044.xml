	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , multi-center , global , Phase II study determine efficacy safety MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy , MEDI4736 monotherapy tremelimumab monotherapy treatment patient recurrent metastatic PD-L1-negative squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) progress treatment 1 systemic palliative regimen recurrent metastatic disease , must contain platinum agent . Patients randomize stratified manner accord prognostic factor , include human papillomavirus ( HPV ) status smoke status achieve balance treatment factor . Patients randomize 1:1:2 fashion receive MEDI4736 monotherapy , tremelimumab monotherapy , MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination . All treatment administer begin Day 0 12 month confirm progression disease ; unless , Investigator 's opinion , patient continue receive benefit treatment ) , initiation alternative cancer therapy , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent , another discontinuation criterion meet . Patients confirm progression disease , Investigator 's opinion , continue receive benefit assign investigational product meet criterion treatment set progression disease may continue receive assign investigational product treatment maximum 12 month consultation Sponsor Investigator 's discretion . The monotherapy arm ( tremelimumab MEDI4736 ) discontinue confirm progression disease follow previous response target lesion ( complete response partial response ) . Tumor assessment perform use compute tomography magnetic resonance imaging . Efficacy patient assess objective tumor assessment every 8 week ( q8w ) first 48 week ( relative date first infusion ) q12w patient disease control 12 month confirm objective disease progression . Following completion discontinuation treatment , patient enter follow-up period .</detailed_description>
