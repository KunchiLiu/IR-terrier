	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) currently first cause death patient compensate HCV cirrhosis.Despite progress , exist therapy limit ability prevent recurrence . Even diagnose early stage , long-term prognosis remain poor due high rate recurrence local treatment . Liver transplantation long-term curative treatment limit advanced age , comorbidities shortage graft It concern less 5 % HCC patient . Therefore , best approach reduce mortality remain reduction HCC incidence . Abundant observational study relate relation insulinoresistance occurrence outcome many cancer . The level IR assess HOMA index recognize independent predictive factor HCC occurrence patient compensate viral C cirrhosis . Metformin , Type 2 diabetic treatment drug , inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis increase stimulation glucose uptake muscle . Independently ' anti diabetic effect , Metformin credit anti tumoral , anti oxidant , anti inflammatory , anti angiogenic property . Amount epidemiological experimental data demonstrate anti tumoral chemopreventive effect metformin certain cancer . From cohort patient compensate HCV cirrhosis treat insulin , observe level IR assess HOMA strong independent risk factor HCC occurrence liver relate death . We also observe cohort diabetic patient compensate HCV cirrhosis , treatment Metformin associate decrease risk HCC occurrence liver relate death . HYPOTHESIS Treatment metformin could decrease HCC occurrence liver relate death transplantation . MAIN OBJECTIVE Evaluation impact Metformin treatment HCC occurrence liver relate death patient compensate HCV cirrhosis Insulinoresistance SECONDARY OBJECTIVE - Occurrence decompensation cirrhosis ( ascite , sepsis , encephalopathy , haemorrhage ) - Evaluation treatment tolerance MAIN CRITERION JUDGMENT Rate HCC occurrence liver related-death transplantation . SECONDARY CRITERION JUDGMENT - Occurrence decompensation cirrhosis ( ascite , sepsis , encephalopathy , haemorrhage ) , - Tolerance STUDY ASSESSMENTS The patient CIRVIR cohort meeting inclusion criterion invite participate study . During next visit , hepatologist , give full verbal write information regard objective procedure study possible benefice side effect treatment . A write inform consent obtain patient agree participate study . The treatment period begin follow randomization . On day M0 baseline measurement take record , metformin administration begin . In order optimize treatment tolerance , suggest patient take pill end lunch . During first week , posology placebo metformin 500 mg breakfast . After , posology increase every week follow : 500 mg morning afternoon , 1000 mg morning afternoon ( 2000 mg per day ) . In case intolerance , maximum posology tolerate maintain . In fact regard primary data trial regard effect metformin colonic polyp , seem possible low dose metformin potentially active This treatment continue end study . FOLLOW UP Patients see one month follow every 3 month . Clinical evaluation HCC screening plan In CIRVIR cohort study , Every 6 month . Duration Treatment per patient : • 36 month Duration Trial Recruitment : • 24 month PARTICIPATING CENTERS : 26 NUMBER OF SUBJECT In order demonstrate reduction 40 % ( HR 0.6 ) event metformin vs placebo 80 % power 5 % two-sided alpha risk , 200 patient per arm necessary.A sample size reassessment make 50 % 75 % patient include base predictive power calculation . We estimate 5 % patient tolerate treatment first month , 5 % lose follow compliant treatment follow period . Therefore , number patient include 222 patient per group . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Clinical data patient prospectively collect computerized database Populations analyze The main analysis base intent-to-treat population ( ITT ) randomize patient In addition explanatory analysis ( PP ) patient randomize &amp; treat without major protocol violations/deviations carry . Pre-defined major protocol violations/deviations : 1. miss data primary efficacy endpoint 2. study drug receive 3. violation inclusion criterion 4 . Additional protocol violation possibly define blind data review Statistical test . Main criterion : rate HCC occurrence liver related-death transplantation . The cumulative incidence HCC liver-related death transplantation compare accord metformin treatment inclusion use log-rank test . In addition , univariate Cox regression model use identify predictive factor primary endpoint . For endpoint , variable P value le 0.10 univariate analysis predict outcome enter stepwise Cox regression multivariate model . For sensitivity analysis , incidence HCC also adjust usual risk factor . The model consider compete risk test use Fine Gray test . Secondary criterion : Occurrence decompensation cirrhosis ( ascite , sepsis , encephalopathy , haemorrhage ) . Comparisons group perform first univariate manner use χ2 test Fisher-exact test . Multiple logistic regression model use assess possible difference group adjust parameter know identified study possibly affect outcome .</detailed_description>
