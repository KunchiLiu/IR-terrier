	<brief_summary>Graft-versus-Host Disease ( GVHD ) , frequent severe complication allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . Much knowledge pathophysiology GVHD gain experimental model far less study disease human . Recent development basic biology open new avenue development biomarker set could predict GVHD severity prognosis could test validated well-designed multicenter clinical trial . The main goal project understand pathogenic mechanism human GVHD one hand , functional immune tolerance . Furthermore , study aim set clinically relevant biomarker set human GVHD immune tolerance discovery cohort . The objective project : 1 . To define phenotypic , functional molecular correlate acute GVHD early HSCT/at onset 2 . To study thymic reconstitution T-cell repertoire HSCT period 2 3 . To identify functional molecular correlate immune tolerance long-term survivor HSCT 4 . Preparing biomarker validation clinical trial We propose prospective analysis cohort 680 patient transplant HLA-identical sibling donor Saint Louis hospital . Analyses perform 3 critical , clinically relevant , period . 1 . Period 1 : Analysis onset GVHD , time engraftment 30 day HSCT patient develop GVHD . An additional blood sample also analyze 90 day HSCT . 2 . Period 2 : Thymic function analysis use measurement T-cell receptor excision circle ( TREC ) perform 6 12 month post-transplant patient . T-cell receptor analysis sort T-cell population perform NGS . 3 . Period 3 : In `` tolerant '' patient ( patient 2 year HSCT require immunosuppressive treatment ) , patient still require immunosuppressive therapy 2 year . We also analyze correspond immune parameter donor . The longitudinal design study allow u provide integrated view GVHD pathophysiology mechanism immune tolerance human . Prospectively identified phenotypic , molecular functional biomarkers test , subsequent study , biological material prospectively collect within French wide CryoStem cohort . Thus , final task project , perform statistical analysis take account confound clinical variable influence outcome ( i.e . GVHD-related death tolerance ) . Preparing clinical trial need move classical Bioinformatics analyse clinically relevant statistical analysis include sequential biological measurement discovery set cohort . Main point take account task following ; 1 . Transplant-related mortality ( TRM ) estimate range 20 % ; 2year post-allogeneic HSCT 2 . TRM mostly ( even totally ) due GVHD associate immune deficiency 3 . GVHD cumulative incidence estimate range 40 % 4 . 80 patient prospectively study 30 patient analyze ( cross sectional study ) part 3 . 5 . Since GVHD-related mortality tolerance mutually exclusive situation optimal calculation validation cohort expect 6 . This calculation basis proposal interventional clinical trial .</brief_summary>
