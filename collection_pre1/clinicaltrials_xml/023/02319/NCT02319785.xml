	<brief_title>Effects Robot-Assisted Combined Therapy Upper Limb Rehabilitation Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke remain leading cause permanent disability Taiwan many country . The high incidence stroke decreased mortality stroke imply urgent need effective rehabilitation . Various contemporary rehabilitation intervention focus restore upper limb motor function advocate stroke rehabilitation . Robot-assisted therapy ( RAT ) , one current prominent activity-based approach , emerge incorporates therapeutic element success stroke motor rehabilitation : combine neuromuscular electrical stimulation mirror therapy design . However , scientific evidence effect RAT combined-therapy functional outcome ( e.g. , motor daily function ) stroke patient remain limited . Furthermore , need identify proper protocol intervention type . This research project use randomize controlled trial design address issue . The main purpose study examine treatment effect combined-therapy RAT use two group combined-therapy different sensory feedback one group unilateral RAT trail compare relative treatment effect mirror therapy group , bilateral RAT , conventional rehabilitation ( CR ) consider motor ability , basic daily function , mobility , quality life , kinematic variable . The inclusion criterion subject first-ever unilateral stroke 3 month onset ; ( 2 ) initial UL subsection Fugl-Meyer Assessment score 18 56 indicate moderate severe moderate UL movement impairment ; ( 3 ) excessive spasticity joint affect UL ( shoulder , elbow , wrist , finger ) ; ( 4 ) able follow study instruction perform study task ; ( 5 ) without upper limb fracture within 3 month ; ( 6 ) lack participation experimental rehabilitation drug study study period ; ( 7 ) well provide write informed consent ; ( 8 ) able realize respond oral instruction . Patients neural psychological medical history , recurrent stroke attack epilepsy intervention exclude . Expected sample size 120 . Subjects randomly assign one six group : ( 1 ) robot-assisted therapy combine neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( RAT-NMES ) ; ( 2 ) robot-assisted therapy combine mirror therapy ( RAT-MT ) ; ( 3 ) mirror therapy group ; ( 4 ) unilateral robot-assisted therapy group ; ( 5 ) bilateral robot-assisted therapy ( 6 ) conventional rehabilitation ( CR ) . All subject study receive treatment register occupational therapist 1.5 hour day , five day week four week . Pretest posttest hold intervention check subject improvement . The outcome measure kinematic analysis upper low limb movement variable , Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( FMA ) , Medical Research Council scale ( MRC ) , MYOTON-3 , accelerometer , Functional Ambulation Category ( FAC ) , Ten-meter walk test , Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) , Stroke Impact Scale ( SIS ) , Action Research Arm Test ( ARAT ) , Wolf Motor Function Test ( WMFT ) , ABILHAND , Motor Activity Log ( MAL ) , Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) . All data calculate SPSS 13.0 . Subject 's age , sex , time stroke group compare descriptive statistic . The change outcome measure intervention group calculate ANOVA see combine therapy good effectiveness group .</detailed_description>
