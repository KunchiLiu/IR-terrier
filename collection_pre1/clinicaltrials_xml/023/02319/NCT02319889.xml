	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study stereotactic body radiation therapy follow combination chemotherapy treat patient non-small cell lung cancer . Stereotactic body radiation therapy specialize radiation therapy deliver one five high dos radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue conventional radiation . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy , follow carboplatin , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation may kill tumor cell result well durable response conventional radiation chemotherapy . The purpose study test safety approach prior large study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study SBRT Plus Chemotherapy Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety/feasibility deliver chemotherapy definitive stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) select stage/situations non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 1-year progression free survival sub-population patient stage IB/II NSCLC , i.e . `` curative intent '' subgroup patient . OUTLINE : Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy every day 14 day total 5 fraction . After break period 30 day , patient start chemotherapy . Patients receive carboplatin intravenously ( IV ) 30-40 minute day 1 paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV 30-40 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
