	<brief_summary>This study investigate repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation deliver protocol call 'continuous theta-burst stimulation ( cTBS ) ' alters motor output force control muscle forearm touch perception individual chronic , incomplete spinal cord injury . CTBS non-invasive technique involve repetitive delivery transcranial magnetic stimulation frequency 30 Hz arm representation primary motor sensory cortex . The purpose study determine whether cTBS effective intervention increase motor output muscle increase force control muscle also improve sense touch .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Individuals With Spinal Cord Injury : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experience injury-induced neuroplasticity occur sensory motor pathway cortex . Sensory motor cortex interconnect collectively allow execution fine , skilled hand control . Of particular interest role somatosensory cortex modulate neural activity within primary motor cortex ultimately influence control hand movement . For somatosensory cortex effective guide hand movement must receive uninterrupted stream somatosensory afferent input skin , muscle tendon active hand movement . Damage afferent input pathway compromise integrity necessary somatosensory input contribute impaired motor control hand . Following incomplete spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , damage somatosensory motor pathway widespread thereby compromise integrity afferent input reach somatosensory cortex [ 1,2 ] . Reducing afferent input somatosensory cortex lead local change concentration GABA promotes sensorimotor reorganization [ 3 ] . Transcranial magnetic stimulation use SCI measure residual corticospinal function [ 4 ] , determine change excitability neural circuitry within primary motor cortex [ 5 ] induce short-lasting change excitability spinal motor neuron [ 6 ] . To date , TMS research SCI primarily focus low limb function , likely fuel desire promote functional recovery locomotion balance control . However , one main determinant promote independent living ability feed groom oneself , rely primarily control upper limb dexterous use hand . The propose research investigate ability increase motor output muscle hand upper limb induce short-lasting change within SI investigate whether functional implication force production , motor control touch perception . TMS may deliver single , pair train repetitive pulse particular body representation within primary motor cortex primary somatosensory cortex . One type repetitive TMS call continuous theta-burst stimulation ( cTBS ) . The present study deliver cTBS primary motor primary somatosensory cortex individual chronic SCI . Measurements make follow cTBS protocol . These measure include 1 ) amplitude motor evoke potential ( MEP ) evoke single pulse TMS measure forearm muscle , 2 ) force production whereby participant ask perform grip strength task maximum force production measure ability dynamically control force production assess , 3 ) touch sensation whereby participant partake temporal order judgment psychophysical task must identify fingertip receive tactile stimulus .</detailed_description>
