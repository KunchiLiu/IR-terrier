	<brief_summary>This study aim evaluate consequence 3 week high protein diet large intestine ecosystem ( microbiota , metabolites gene expression rectal mucosa ) . Those parameter analyse technics include OMICs method . After run-in period , 42 volunteer receive either soy milk protein maltodextrin placebo control . This trial double blind randomize placebo-controlled paralleled design ( 3 arm ) . Longitudinal sample allow comparison parameter study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High protein diet widely use slimming effect . Those diet increase quantity undigested protein peptide reach large intestine . Microbiota utilizes protein peptide substrates produce amino-acid derived metabolite short chain fatty acid , branch chain fatty acid , lactate , formate , succinate , ammonium , hydrogen sulfide phenolic compound . Some metabolite show beneficial host whereas could deleterious . High protein diet may different effect whether base animal plant protein since two kind protein different amino acid composition slightly different digestibility . The objective study evaluate overweight volunteer consequence high protein diet ( animal v vegetal ) vs isocaloric-normoproteic diet level large intestine metabolism . Firstly , composition activity microbiota metabolite produce large intestine lumen determine . Then , evaluate consequence test diet mucosal physiology , gene expression analyze rectal biopsy fecal water test colonocytes cell line . Lastly , consequence diet host metabolism evaluate . Dietary intervention Before study , volunteer ( n=42 ) provide 3 day food record utilize dietician calculate usual energy intake . The study start 2 week normalization period volunteer eat accord menu ( Fig . 1 ) . The diet provide volunteer usual individual energy intake ; protein , carbohydrates fat respectively provide 15 , 50 35 % energy intake . At end standardization period , volunteer randomly assign 3 group ( n=14 ) 3 week ( intervention period ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Volunteers 3 group follow diet reduce digestible carbohydrate intake ( 15 % energy intake ) undigestible carbohydrate intake remain unchanged . The volunteer consume 3 time per day dietary supplement powder dissolve water drink . This supplement provide 15 % energy intake . The first group receive casein ( animal protein ) supplement high protein diet ( protein , carbohydrates fat respectively provide 30 , 35 35 % energy intake ) . The second group receive soy protein ( vegetal ) supplement also consume high protein diet ( protein , carbohydrates fat respectively provide 30 , 35 35 % energy intake ) . The third group receive maltodextrin ( digestible carbohydrate , placebo control ) supplement ingest normoproteic diet , similar macronutrient composition standardization diet ( protein , carbohydrates fat respectively provide 15 , 50 35 % energy intake ) . The dietary supplement give double-blinded protocol . There energy restriction standaridization intervention period . Clinical protocol Daily , volunteer measure body weight record food consumption physical activity . Once week , phone call dietician ensure dietary compliance ( Fig . 2 ) . At end normalization period , 13 day begin study ( D13 ) , volunteer collect 24h urine sample . Stool sample collect even D13 morning D14 . A cooler provide volunteer storage transport sample . After one night fasting , morning D14 , volunteer come hospital bring sample immediately condition storage . Blood sample collect . Then , rectal biopsy recover . Every week intervention period , urine stool blood sample ( D21 , D28 , D35 ) . At end intervention period , rectal biopsy recover ( D35 ) . Body weight blood pressure measure visit . Analyses All measured parameter express relatively baseline . Dietary intake evaluate dietician base food record . Stool sample - Microbiota composition function - Luminal metabolites composition - pH , osmolarity , water content - Fecal water test HT-29 cell ( colonocytes ) mitochondrial respiration , proliferation , genotoxicity , cytotoxicity , gene expression Urines - Urea creatinine assay ( protein consumption marker verify dietary compliance ) - Metabolomics Blood - Clinical parameter ( total cholesterol , LDL HDL cholesterol , non-esterified fatty acid , triglyceride , glycemia , insulinemia ) - Metabolomics Rectal biopsy â€¢ Transcriptomic analysis</detailed_description>
