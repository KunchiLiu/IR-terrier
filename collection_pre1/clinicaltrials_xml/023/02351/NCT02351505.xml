	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well selinexor work treat patient small-cell lung cancer return period improvement . One specific way cancer cell continue grow get rid certain protein call `` tumor suppressor protein : would normally cause cancer cell die . Selinexor work trap `` tumor suppressing protein '' within cell may cause cancer cell die stop growing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy single agent selinexor measure progression free survival ( PFS ) patient relapse chemotherapy-sensitive small cell lung cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective tumor response rate disease control rate determine radiographic response . II . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) patient relapse small cell lung cancer . III . To evaluate safety tolerability single agent selinexor patient population . IV . Comparison patient 's time progression ( TTP ) selinexor TTP his/her previous therapy ( y ) . V. To evaluate correlative endpoint include tumor biopsy analysis secrete factor , leukocyte ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) analysis . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Analysis secrete factor ( nerve growth factor [ NGF ] , brain-derived neurotrophic factor [ BDNF ] ) . II . Tumor biopsy ( baseline cycle 2 ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive selinexor orally ( PO ) twice weekly . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 3 month , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
