	<detailed_description>Study Design Population : The propose study use cluster-randomized , 2 period crossover design , clinical trial evaluate promise new intervention , namely 70 % isopropyl alcohol embed protective cap , reduce CLABSIs , 2ndry BSI , SPBC home chronic central line pediatric hematology/oncology patient . The Control Arm involve `` usual care '' ambulatory central line per institutional policy Intervention Arm add use 70 % isopropyl alcohol embed protective cap `` usual care . Each participate institution randomly assign either intervention control phase design first 12 month study . There 3 month wash period , follow institution implement either control intervention phase another 12 month institution complete 12 month intervention arm control arm study . Sixteen pediatric hematology/oncology institution serve core population proposal unit randomization . All ambulatory patient take care pediatric hematology/oncology clinic institution eligible study . The inclusion criterion presence external central line . Given intervention protective cap central line access port , patient totally implanted port central venous access eligible study intervention physically applicable central line . The intervention investigator deploy CUROS® brand 70 % isopropyl alcohol embed protective cap central line . These cap manufacture Ivera Medical Corporation . As kind contribution propose study , Ivera Medical Corporation agree donate distribute need CUROS® cap participate institution duration study . If participate team wish instead use comparable brand 70 % isopropyl alcohol embed protective cap central line permit . Distribution CUROS® cap accomplish within clinic participate institution compliance intervention home monitor clinic staff via track count CUROS® cap dispense family . Children chronic hematologic/oncologic condition see frequently clinic , often every week . Clinic staff distribute track volume CUROS® cap dispense family/patient , family/patient report back visit volume CUROS® cap utilized . This ensure reliable distribution families/patients , provide face face educational opportunity ensure proper application CUROS® cap , provide compliance opportunity via count CUROS® cap utilized . This proposal involve cluster-randomized , 2 period crossover design , clinical trial . Given proposal 's focus reduce central line infection home , main facilitator best practice use cap home family patient . The research team spread need additional education , tool , data , analysis , support proposal . Study Organization Timeline : The work build partnership pediatric quality improvement research group Johns Hopkins University vendor Ivera Medical Corporation , maker CUROS® brand 70 % isopropyl alcohol embed protective cap central line . Dr. Miller Principal Investigator serve Vice Chair Quality Safety , Director Division Quality Safety Johns Hopkins Children 's Center . Dr. Miller lead continue lead effort transform quality safety delivery system Johns Hopkins University formally train Lean Six Sigma quality improvement well Masters Science degree clinical research . In addition , Dr. Aaron Milstone Johns Hopkins University , director pediatric hospital epidemiology infection control accomplish researcher pediatric infection prevention , Co-Investigator proposal . Dr. Milstone lead recently publish clinical trial work Lancet describe impact chlorhexidine bath CLABSI positive blood culture child 10 PICUs . Dr. Elizabeth Colantuoni Biostatistician Assistant Scientist Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health . The work span four year . Year 1 Preparatory work include establish Institutional Review Board approval participate institution , set data collection submission process , set distribution mechanism intervention clinic within clinic home , educate provider , patient , family apply CUROS® cap across participate institution . Years 2 , 3 , 4 include two 12 month trial period 3 month wash period . The last 9 month Year 4 use data analysis manuscript preparation . Methods SPECIFIC AIM 1 SPECIFIC AIM 2 : Specific Aim # 1 : Evaluate whether use 70 % isopropyl alcohol embed protective cap central line reduces rate CLABSI ambulatory pediatric hematology/oncology patient . Hypothesis : Use 70 % isopropyl alcohol embed protective cap central line associate least 25 % reduction ambulatory CLABSI rate pediatric hematology/oncology patient . Specific Aim # 2 : Evaluate whether use 70 % isopropyl alcohol embed protective cap central line reduces rate positive blood culture ambulatory pediatric hematology/oncology patient . Hypothesis : Use 70 % isopropyl alcohol embed protective cap central line associate least 25 % reduction positive blood culture rate home pediatric hematology/oncology patient . Independent variable : The primary independent variable CLABSI rate Specific Aim # 1 positive blood culture rate , define CLABSI rate + 2ndry BSI rate + SPBC rate , Specific Aim # 2 . All participate unit already devote Hospital Infection Control staff identify track 3 type ambulatory central line infection . Dependent variable : The dependent variable Specific Aims dichotomous assignment either control intervention arm unit receive arm . Data collection method : All Hematology/Oncology unit submit monthly aggregate clinic data CLABSI , 2ndry BSI SPBC ( numerator denominator ) via web-based data entry tool . Exploratory analysis : Descriptive statistic unit level calculate summarize rate infection ( CLABSI infection ) time unit receive control treatment arm . Scatterplots line plot use describe trend infection rate course study separately treatment arm . In case miss data occurs analysis explore relationship miss data unit 's observe data month prior analysis method valid assumption miss data generate completely random depend prior observe rate ( miss random ) . Our data integrity effort frequent contact team work minimize instance miss data . Multivariate analysis : Generalized linear mixed Poisson regression model use test treatment effect . Specifically , monthly number CLABSI ( Specific Aim # 1 ) monthly number infection ( Specific Aim # 2 ) model function dichotomous treatment assignment indicator treatment arm receive ( first second 12 month period ) inclusion offset represent monthly number central line day random intercept unit account correlation monthly rate infection time within unit . The model rely two key assumption : ) infection rate follow Poisson distribution mean rate variance rate ii ) correlation rate within unit time exchangeable . These assumption assess via descriptive analysis add robust variance estimate cluster unit . Methods , Specific Aim # 3 : To evaluate whether use 70 % isopropyl alcohol embed protective cap central line change distribution bacteria isolate blood culture ambulatory pediatric hematology/oncology patient . Hypothesis : Use 70 % isopropyl alcohol embed protective cap central line associate altered microbial epidemiology CLABSI , secondary blood steam infection , single positive blood culture home pediatric hematology/oncology patient . Independent variable : Organisms isolate blood culture ( CLABSI + 2ndry BSI + SPBC ) patient involve study collect participate team Control Intervention arm clinical trial sort Gram Positive versus Gram Negative organism . Dependent variable : The dependent variable Specific Aim dichotomous assignment either control intervention arm . Data collection method : All Hematology/Oncology ambulatory care team submit microbial pattern data CLABSI , 2ndry BSI SPBC . Analyses : The analysis would comparison proportion Gram positive organism cause CLABSI , 2ndry BSI SPBC control intervention study arm . Given Gram positive organism common organism cause CLABSI SPBC child , achieve reduction Gram positive organism would important additional finding clinical trial .</detailed_description>
