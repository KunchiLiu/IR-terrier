	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether routine combination optimal thiazide K+-sparing diuretic increase efficacy BP reduction reduce risk glucose intolerance ; whether K+-sparing diuretic alone may neutral even beneficial effect upon glucose tolerance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Single Combination Diuretics Low-Renin Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major attraction K+-sparing diuretic may absence risk new-onset diabetes ( DM ) . Since compare hypertension outcome trial , DM endpoint heart failure study spironolactone eplerenone , know certain whether clean respect . Short-term study suggest are.49 Interestingly INSIGHT excess DM patient receive HCTZ 25mg , combine amiloride 2.5mg , increase 30 % patient HCTZ/amiloride 50/5mg.44 In propose study shall use oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) provide endpoint subject . This strategy recently employ demonstrate difference 12 week dose thiazide diuretic50 . Hyperkalaemia traditional concern K+-sparing diuretic . We expect demonstrate patient eGFR ≥45 , risk hyperkalaemia nullify combination thiazide . Instead amiloride use mainly trace dos balance hypokalaemia thiazide , practice might reverse think thaizides `` partner '' use negate risk hyperkalaemia . The challenge design study compare several option among diuretic achieve clear cut answer : 1. comparison combination single diuretic 2. comparison K+-sparing diuretic thiazide . A study sufficient duration establish efficacy tolerability ( especially upon glucose tolerance ) crossover design therefore require large number subject compare option . In order maximize recruitment whilst also maximize sensitivity detect change OGTT , open trial patient hypertension diuretic reasonable next option , provide one feature metabolic syndrome - additional hypertension .</detailed_description>

Participation clinical study involve investigational drug/device within 4 week screen . 13 . Any concomitant condition may adversely affect safety and/or efficacy study drug severely limit subject 's lifespan ability complete study 14 . Treatment follow prohibited medication : Oral corticosteroid within 3 month Screening prohibit study participation . Chronic stable unstable use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug acetylsalicylic acid prohibit . Chronic use define &gt; 3 consecutive nonconsecutive day treatment per week . intermittent use NSAIDs strongly discourage throughout duration study . If intermittent treatment require , NSAIDs must use total 2 day . For subject require analgesic antipyretic agent , use paracetamol recommend study participation . The use shortacting oral nitrate ( eg , sublingual nitroglycerin ) permit ; however , subject take shortacting oral nitrate within 4 hour Screening subsequent study visit . The use longacting oral nitrate permit ; however , dose must stable least 2 week prior screening/ randomisation . Use sympathomimetic decongestant permit ; , within 1 week prior screen randomisation . within 1 day prior study visit ; The use theophylline permit ; however , dose must stable least 4 week prior Screening throughout study participation . The use phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) type V inhibitor permit ; however , subject must refrain take medication within 1 day Screening subsequent study visit .</criteria>
