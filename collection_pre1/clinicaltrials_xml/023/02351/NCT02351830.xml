	<brief_summary>The EEU proven effective multiple study evaluate various aspect seasonal allergic rhinitis . All previous EEU clinical trial utilize ragweed grass pollen allergen choice dispersal , due local population , many emerge treatment allergic rhinitis allergen specific , thus desirable expand repertoire pollen selection use EEU . Ragweed , grass birch pollen differ appearance size essentially , characteristic promote ability keep pollen grain suspend hence , ability maintain proper concentration within EEU . Preliminary validation study conduct EEU , absent human volunteer , confirm ability release , disperse maintain birch pollen concentration EEU use exist technology . This study aim validate use birch pollen clinical scale . By add non- allergic participant EEU , investigator hope determine non-allergic person exhibit difference baseline `` epigenetic biomarkers '' pre-existing establish allergic airway inflammation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Validation Birch Pollen EEU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Environmental Exposure Unit ( EEU ) control allergen challenge model allergic rhinitis ( 'hayfever ' ) use extensively study various anti-allergic therapy . The EEU unique , internationally recognize research facility allow exposure group 5 many 150 volunteer simultaneously ambient level airborne allergen ragweed pollen provide unique study environment ideally suit evaluate efficacy onset action various anti-allergic medication . This specialized facility , locate within Kingston General Hospital , allow tight regulation environmental variable air quality , temperature , humidity CO2 level well precise maintenance allergen concentration within specialized room . Thus EEU provide close environment participant expose predetermine , control , constant level airborne pollen . All previous study use either ragweed grass pollen , investigator clinically validate use birch pollen EEU . This study confirm birch pollen circulate EEU generate allergic rhinitis symptom similar see 'real world ' , also provide opportunity collect blood participant allergen challenge order well understand allergic inflammation , hopefully someday identify novel therapy allergic disease . This study consist Screening Visit one pollen exposure visit . The duration participant 's participation study Screening End Study ( EOS ) approximately 3 week . The study population consist healthy , ambulatory male female volunteer , 18-65 year age either history seasonal allergic rhinitis history allergic reaction . Approximately 55-75 participant screen ensure 50 eligible participant enrol study ( 40 allergic , 10 non-allergic ) . All participant give write informed consent prior study procedure perform . Participants meet inclusion/exclusion criterion screen process ask return EEU pollen exposure visit . At Screening visit participant provide full medical history undergo physical examination . They height/weight vitals measure skin testing perform confirm allergic response panel common aeroallergens ( lack response non-allergic individual ) . Women child bear potential undergo urine pregnancy test rule pregnancy . Eligible participant ask return research site one 4 hour exposure birch pollen Environmental Exposure Unit ( EEU ) . Peripheral blood sample collect pollen exposure measurement potential biomarkers .</detailed_description>
