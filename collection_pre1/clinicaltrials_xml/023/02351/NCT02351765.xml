	<brief_title>ABC-08 : Phase Ib Trial Acelarin Combination With Cisplatin Locally Advanced/ Metastatic Biliary Tract Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Active chemotherapy drug treatment advance biliary tract cancer ( ABC ) include gemcitabine , fluoropyrimidines platinum agent . The United Kingdom ( UK ) National Cancer Research Network ( NCRN ) ABC-02 study establish cisplatin gemcitabine standard care first-line treatment patient ABC regimen widely adopt UK internationally . However , inherent acquire tumour resistance limit efficacy gemcitabine necessary explore alternative treatment . The study explore combination acelarin , drug design specifically overcome key cancer resistance mechanism associate gemcitabine , cisplatin . As first time combination acelarin cisplatin give patient aim study investigate safety combination establish recommend phase II dose acelarin . This phase Ib , single-arm , multi-centre , open-label trial . The trial design classic 3+3 design patient recruit cohort 3 6 patient different dose level dose level phase II determine . Patients cohort monitor closely safety drug toxicity . Secondary trial objective involve assess activity acelarin combination cisplatin term of; progression-free survival , overall survival response rate , well explore pharmacokinetic profile combination .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically/cytologically verify , nonresectable recurrent/metastatic cholangiocarcinoma , gallbladder ampullary carcinoma . No prior systemic therapy allow advanced biliary cancer . Prior low dose chemotherapy use without radiotherapy adjuvant setting allow complete &gt; 6 month enrolment . Recent palliative radiation ( within 28 day prior consent ) allow candidate measurable disease outside radiation field . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . Age ≥ 18 year life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Adequate renal function serum urea serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine clearance ≥ 30ml/min . Adequate haematological function : Hb ≥ 10g/dl , white blood count ( WBC ) ≥ 3.0 x 10*9/L , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10*9/L , platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3 . Adequate liver function : total bilirubin &lt; 30 μmol/L alkaline phosphatase , along aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and/or alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 5 x ULN . Adequate biliary drainage , evidence ongoing infection . Women child bear age MUST negative pregnancy test prior study entry AND use highly effective contraception method ( combine progestogenonly hormonal contraception , intrauterine device , intrauterine hormonereleasing system , vasectomise partner* ( ) sexual abstinence** ( b ) ) must continue 6 month end study treatment , unless child bear potential terminate surgery/radical radiotherapy infertility due bilateral tubal occlusion . Male subject must either successful vasectomy ( confirm azoospermia ) female partner meet criterion ( childbearing potential practicing adequate contraception [ e.g . combine progestogenonly hormonal contraception , intrauterine device , intrauterine hormonereleasing system , sexual abstinence** ( b ) ] throughout study period 6 month end study treatment ) . Patients must history malignant disease ( within previous 5 year must evidence recurrence ) , adequately treat nonmelanotic skin cancer insitu carcinoma uterine cervix . Patients must give write informed consent . Patients must register within 4 week diagnosis advance disease; patient must start treatment within 6 week diagnosis advance disease . ( ) The vasectomised partner must receive medical assessment confirm surgical success . ( b ) Sexual abstinence line prefer usual lifestyle subject . History allergic reaction attribute previous gemcitabine cisplatin treatment . Previous treatment Acelarin . Incomplete recovery previous therapy ( surgery/adjuvant therapy/radiotherapy ) unresolved biliary tree obstruction . Any evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease , view investigator , make undesirable patient participate trial . Evidence significant clinical disorder laboratory finding , opinion investigator make undesirable patient participate trial . Any patient medical psychiatric condition impairs ability give inform consent . Any serious uncontrolled medical condition . Clinical evidence metastatic disease brain . Any pregnant lactating woman . Preexisting hear impairment .</criteria>
