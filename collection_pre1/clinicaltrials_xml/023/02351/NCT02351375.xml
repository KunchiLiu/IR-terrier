	<brief_summary>This study explore whether IntelliCap® system use study human microbiota composition small intestine . The IntelliCap® system oral drug delivery patient monitoring system consist capsule-shaped device ancillary equipment . The IntelliCap® capsule also able aspirate fluid environment . Here , explore whether capsule able take fluid sample lumen gastrointestinal tract microbiota analysis . To study , control dietary intervention expect induce temporary change microbiota composition perform healthy volunteer . Microbiota composition sample collect small intestine use IntelliCap® system compare fecal sample individual collect time point .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MICRO-study : The IntelliCap® System Gastrointestinal Fluid Sampling Tool</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The gut microbiota involve regulation host metabolic immune pathway , important target dietary intervention . Studies human microbiota mainly base analysis fecal sample . The microbiota small intestine least equally relevant health large intestine , regional composition differs largely . Small intestinal sampling require invasive procedure . Recently , electronic medical device , IntelliCap® system , develop site-specific delivery drug gastrointestinal tract patient monitoring . This capsule adapt used aspirate liquid environment . The IntelliCap® system may offer minimally-invasive tool sample small intestinal fluid human microbiota analysis . Objective : To evaluate IntelliCap® system tool study change small intestinal microbiota composition human vivo safety tolerability . Study design : A randomized cross-over control feeding trial human perform 10 healthy male volunteer ( age 18-30 yr ) . Two diet use : three-day high-protein versus high-carbohydrate diet , precede washout diet . These diet target microbiota fundamentally different fermentation requirement . The IntelliCap® capsule administer intervention period collect fluid sample distal small bowel . In parallel , fecal sample collect . Microbiota composition analyze sequence use Illumina technology follow dedicate bioinformatic analysis . Blood sample collect stored measure metabolic parameter marker satiety potentially correlate microbiota data .</detailed_description>
