	<brief_summary>Patients gallstone disease check whether common bile duct ( CBD ) stone could present . In case certain suspicion CBD stone investigation perform . This either do magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreaticography ( MRCP ) intraoperative cholangiography . The study investigate pathway would favorable regard early hospital demission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiological Investigation Bile Duct Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients gallstone disease suspect bile duct obstruction investigate either magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreaticography ( MRCP ) prior gallbladder removal intraoperative cholangiography cholecystectomy . When detect common bile duct ( CBD ) stone MRCP , normally endoscopic removal perform operation . When CBD stone detect gallbladder removal instead , endoscopic retrograde cannulation pancreatic duct ( ERCP ) follow operation . Investigators hypothesize direct operation shorten length hospital stay . Therefore investigator randomize patient elevate Bilirubin , elevate liver enzyme ( two follow : aspartate transaminase ( ASAT ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALAT ) , gamma-glutamyltransferase ( gGT ) AP ) , suspect CBD stone ultrasound dilate common bile duct either MRCP first operation first pathway . All data ( patient admission discharge , ... ) enter online database</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients present regular admission emergency department ( ED ) cholecystolithiasis suspect CBD stone . The indication CBD investigation require one follow feature : i. Elevated bilirubin ii . ASAT/ALAT gGT aP normal range ( two ) iii . Choledocholithiasis ultrasound iv . Dilated bile duct ultrasound Written inform consent Age 18 year Patients biliary pancreatitis ( due fact conservative treatment initiate gallbladder removal therefore lead prolonged hospital stay ) Septic patient due cholangitis Patients unable consent Patients medical condition prevent surgery Pregnancy Radiologically proven CBD stone</criteria>
