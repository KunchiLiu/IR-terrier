	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) commonly associate behavioural change agitation . Severe agitation important treat increase progression AD physical health problem ( increase fall weight loss ) , also decrease quality life increase caregiver stress . Currently prescribe treatment ( i.e. , antipsychotic ) agitation AD work everybody work effect small increase risk harmful side effect , include death . As result , urgent need safe medication option . The cannabinoid nabilone prescribe capsule form appetite pain kill effect . Nabilone 's calm effect may benefit agitation , help weight loss untreated pain frequently associate agitation . Through clinical trial , investigator hope identify benefit nabilone treatment agitation AD . The investigator objective determine whether nabilone efficacious safe treatment agitation , well benefit pain , weight behavioural symptom . This 14 week clinical trial ( participant take nabilone 6 week , placebo 6 week ( order randomize ) 1 week treatment ) . The investigator assess compare agitation , weight , pain , memory , behaviour safety . Nabilone new class medication may safe effective treatment agitation AD , add benefit appetite pain . Reducing symptom would increase quality-of-life reduce caregiver stress .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The investigator objective provide pilot data address whether ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) analogue nabilone pharmacological option manage agitation , particularly difficult treat neuropsychiatric symptom ( NPS ) , well benefit pain , weight overall NPS , gather double-blind information tolerability safety . This group symptoms particularly prevalent patient moderate severe AD . Rationale : The high prevalence impact agitation patient moderate severe Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) make neuropsychiatric symptom ( NPS ) key determinant decrease quality life . Associated agitation weight loss , pain , lead additional loss quality life . Agitation frequently necessitate use antipsychotic , , well-studied , modest efficacy severe side effect include increased mortality . With development synthetic THC analogue , therapeutic potential cannabinoids evaluate . Cannabinoids prescribe capsule treat anorexia pain certain patient group . In addition potentially beneficial effect appetite pain , recent study suggest positive effect nabilone agitation dementia . Importantly , addition psychotropic effect , emerge evidence suggest neuroprotective ( inhibit Aβ-induced microglial activation excitotoxicity ) anti-inflammatory ability , decrease oxidative stress , stark contrast negative effect antipsychotic . As , system high potential relevance agitate patient AD . Research Plan : This randomize cross-over study compare 6 week nabilone placebo , 1 week placebo washout precede treatment phase Long-term care ( LTC ) patient , outpatient moderate severe AD agitation . Study outcomes measure baseline end treatment treatment phase . The primary outcome measure Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory ( CMAI ) . The secondary outcome weight ( kg ) , overall NPS ( Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) ) , NPI agitation/aggression subscale , nutrition ( Mini Nutritional Assessment - Short Form ( MNA-SF ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , skin fold thickness ) , pain ( The Pain Assessment In Advanced Dementia ( PAINAD ) ) , cognition ( Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) ; Severe Impairment Battery ( SIB ) ) clinical significance ( Alzheimer 's Cooperative Study-Clinician Global Impression change ( ADCS-CGIC ) . Safety ( heart rate , blood pressure , adverse event ) also assess every visit .</detailed_description>
