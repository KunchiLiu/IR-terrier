	<brief_summary>Therefore , purpose study compare effectiveness two exercise training program improve cardiorespiratory fitness : ACE three-zone training model ( i.e. , threshold base training ) versus common ACSM recommend relative percent method ( i.e. , % HRR ) . It hypothesize : 1 . The ACE three-zone training model elicit great mean change cardiorespiratory fitness ( measure VO2max ) compare relative percent method . 2 . Participants ACE three-zone training model group likely favorable VO2max response ; comparatively , participant relative percent method group would likely experience VO2max nonresponse exercise training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Exercise Intensity Prescription</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiorespiratory fitness , typically determine maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) , fundamental measurement exercise physiologist health professional . VO2max refer high rate oxygen take consume body intense exercise . The `` F.I.T.T . '' principle acronym four component exercise prescription : frequency , intensity , time ( length ) , type exercise . Exercise intensity arguably critical component exercise prescription model . Failure meet minimal threshold value may result lack training effect , high exercise intensity could lead over-training negatively impact adherence exercise program . The traditional reference standard prescribe exercise intensity express term percentage heart rate reserve ( % HRR ) oxygen uptake reserve ( % VO2R ) . This consider 'relative percent method ' . The American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) currently recommend exercise intensity 40-59 % HRR/VO2R improve maintain cardiorespiratory fitness . Nevertheless , despite large evidence base support ACSM relative percent concept recommendation prescribe exercise intensity , concern approach consist large range acceptable percentage fails take account individual metabolic response exercise . This study seek compare effectiveness two exercise training program improve cardiorespiratory fitness : ACE three-zone training model ( i.e. , threshold base training ) versus common ACSM recommend relative percent concept ( i.e. , % HRR ) . Apparently healthy , sedentary men woman ( n = 42 ) randomize non-exercise control group one two exercise training group . Exercise training perform 30 min/day 5 days/wk 12wk accord one two exercise intensity regimens : 1 ) relative percent method use intensity prescribe accord percentage heart rate reserve ( HRR group ) , 2 ) threshold base method ( ACE-3ZM ) use intensity prescribed accord first ventilatory threshold ( VT1 ) second ventilatory threshold ( VT2 ) .</detailed_description>
