	<brief_summary>A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled intervention trial involve 100 treated subject undergo endonasal trans-sphenoidal ( ENTS ) resection pituitary lesion . Subjects randomize two group : 50 treat opioid-sparing arm 50 treated standard post-operative medication arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Post-operative pain control common concern patient consider undergoing surgical procedure . Although effective treat acute pain , opioid analgesic also associate dose-dependent adverse effect , include constipation , nausea vomiting , alter mental status , respiratory depression , show increase patient length stay . The use non-opioid analgesic different mechanism action acute pain control via multi-modal approach efficacious reduce opioid consumption , decrease incidence adverse effect , improve patient satisfaction recovery time , decrease hospital costs.Certain minimally invasive procedure may afford many patient opportunity achieve adequate post-operative pain control minimal requirement opioid analgesic , thereby spar patient know adverse effect increase length stay cost . The ENTS approach resection pituitary tumor standard surgical procedure lesion , associate pain easily manage post-operatively , make ideal procedure opioid-sparing post-operative pain regimen . Anecdotally , investigator note investigator 's post-operative pituitary patient population post-operative pain frequently adequately manage schedule non-opioid analgesic , often without require breakthrough opioid dose . Another safe effective non-opioid analgesic widely use multi-modal pain management moderate pain IV Caldolor ( ibuprofen ) . After literature review , investigator unable find study attempt use opioid-sparing analgesic regimen post-operative pain control follow ENTS approach resection pituitary tumor .</detailed_description>
