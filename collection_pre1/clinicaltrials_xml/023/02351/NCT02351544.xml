	<brief_summary>According peripheral trigger theory migraine headache , nociceptive input irritate compressed cranial nerve branch lead neurovascular change brain cause migraine headache . Advanced treatment aim deactivate peripheral trigger point administer patient fail medical management migraine . Those accepted advanced treatment include botulinum toxin A injection order temporarily paralyze muscle cause nerve compression , surgery release compression point permanently . An advantage surgery ability release non-muscular cause nerve compression , fascial band intersect artery . Botulinum toxin A injection trigger sit show multiple study effective reduce frequency severity migraine headache , commonly administer treatment refractory migraine . It approve FDA treatment chronic migraine . Similarly , surgical decompression trigger sit previously show superior clinical outcome medical management , randomize , blind controlled-trial performed Case Western Reserve 2009 . Patients either receive actual decompression trigger site , sham surgery ( exposure visualization trigger site , without decompression ) . At one-year follow-up , group underwent actual surgery demonstrate statistically high proportion significant improvement migraine ( 83.7 % vs. 57.7 % , p=0.014 ) , complete elimination migraine ( 57.1 % vs. 3.8 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) . Several report confirm good clinical outcome surgery demonstrate trial , surgical decompression commonly perform several surgeon around United States . Prognostic factor predict success surgical decompression migraine headache treatment include old age migraine onset , visual symptoms/aura , 4-site decompression . Factors predict failure surgery include excessive operative blood loss , surgery one two trigger site . One criticism study peripheral trigger decompression surgery migraine result originated institution ( Case Western Reserve ) , author ( Guyuron ) . While several study institution demonstrate positive outcome peripheral trigger decompression , include small number patient . In addition , sham surgery randomized-controlled trial criticize clarify prior treatment patient undergone peripheral trigger deactivation , show medication use pattern change surgery . Another criticism study fact patient examine neurologist study study , surgery perform patient episodic migraine , know benefit botulinum toxin . It unclear migraine type likely benefit surgical decompression . The investigator ' goal perform multi-center , prospective trial demonstrate effectiveness peripheral trigger decompression treatment migraine headache , would address criticism mention . The main aim demonstrate positive result demonstrate Guyuron et al reproducible institution surgeon use similar technique different patient population .</brief_summary>
