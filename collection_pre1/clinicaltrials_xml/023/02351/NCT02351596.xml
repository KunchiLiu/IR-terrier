	<detailed_description>Introduction The 'Core Muscles ' define '29 pair muscle support lumbo-pelvic hip complex order stabilize spine , pelvis kinetic chain functional movement ' . Core stability refers control , co-ordination synergism require core muscle maintenance functional stability balance . The role core musculature play movement postural control long establish . The understanding core muscle work feed-forward manner , lay foundation distal limb movement , form basis study use core stability training programme , pilate , core control train spinal stability training , improved postural control balance . Literature replete study investigate use core stability programme vary population adult population chronic back pain elite athlete injury prevention performance . Studies investigate use adult postural control impairment due upper motor neuron lesion ( UMN ) Multiple Sclerosis Stroke show positive effect balance mobility . The randomised controlled trial , Chung et al , look effect 4 week core stability exercise class Dynamic Balance Gait Function 16 stroke patient . It show significant improvement Timed-Up-And-Go ( TUG ) score 33.06 +-18.39sec 27.64+- 13.73 sec ( p=0.057 ) intervention group . Gait velocity ( 44.83+- 18.83 cm/s 58.91 +- 18.21 ; p=0.024 ) cadence ( 74.55+- 13.85 steps/min 84.07 +- 14.00 steps/min ; p=0.041 ) also show significant improvement intervention group . To date study investigate use potential benefit specific core stability intervention Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) population . CP describe group permanent disorder development movement posture , cause activity limitation , attribute non- progressive disturbance occur develop fetal infant brain . It suggest poor postural control may underlie delay deviation motor skill acquisition development observe child CP . Therefore , important treatment child CP try improve postural control evidence suggest postural control mechanisms school-age child CP modifiable signifies goal achievable . Young child CP show use excessive , non-reciprocal trunk hip muscle activation walk . It hypothesize one reason may need compensate poor control core deep stabilising muscle , thus limit ability control change body 's centre mass ( COM ) dynamic movement . To understand must look closer different function core muscle . The core muscle separate large-lever , superficial global muscle , include rectus abdominis psoas major , function primary mover small , deep , local muscle , include Transverse Abdominis Internal oblique , function primary stabiliser . It postulate deep stabiliser adequately function , postural control assist secondary compensatory activation muscle typically function primary mover like hip flexor , knee flexor spinal extensor . When primary mover use compensate deep stabiliser , become less efficient role mobilize posturally adjust . An ineffective deep stabilizing system also limit ability body maintain joint position muscle mechanical advantage . This add 'weakening ' effect muscle essential postural control , like gluteus medius , reduce force-generating capacity . The objective study : 1 . To measure change performance series static , anticipatory reactive balance task use three dimensional motion analysis child participate core stability ( intervention group ) compare child continue usual care ( control group ) . 2 . To compare change functional balance test intervention group control group 3 . To analyse qualitative data post intervention questionnaire determine broad effect 'Core stability ' group intervention child 's real life function , participation quality life . Selection Criteria The study aim investigate effect treatment intervention child Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) . It best research practice choose homogenous group participant meaningful result . It show relation balance ambulatory child spastic CP , functional classification system ( Gross motor Function Classification System-GMFCS level ) use group child homogenously traditional classification diagnosis . On basis , decide include child GMFCS level I II . Ambulatory child GMFCS classification level III exclude study show large gap balance ability level II III . This would lead much great variance participant sample.The Central Remedial Clinic ( CRC ) database client attend Clondalkin Clontarf physiotherapy service use generate list client age 7 17 , spastic CP diplegia hemiplegia GMFCs level I II centre . The study inclusion/exclusion criterion apply list . The client meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion remove . The remain client invite participate study list generate participant agree . The resulting list split 2 separate age group ( Age 7-12 year Age 13-17 year ) unique identify number assign client day initial baseline assessment . The client assess group minimum 6 maximum 12 randomise accord procedure detail . Sample Size The sample size calculate Stata IC 13 ( StataCorp , Texas , USA ) use step length primary outcome measure . A previous study compare gait CP typically develop child level uneven ground find mean difference 9cm ( standard deviation 9cm ) step length group ( Malone et al 2014 , submit publication ) . With power 0.9 significance level 0.05 , sample size 22 group derive , give total 44 . To allow 10 % drop , decide enroll 48 participant study . Randomisation A randomisation procedure carry individual blind treatment assessment procedure . The unique identifying number individual group in-putted electronic randomisation tool . Group assignment know treat therapist assess therapist ensure single-blind design . The participant allocate base randomisation either Intervention ( I ) control ( C ) . Statistical analysis The primary research question whether core stability class improve movement function intervention group ( I ) compare control group ( C ) . Data plot graphically describe first instance use mean , median , standard deviation . Normality assess use Shapiro Wilk test . Groups inspect baseline comparability . Quantitative parametric data movement analysis assessment compare ( I ) ( C ) group use analysis co-variance include baseline level outcome adjust baseline imbalance . Non-normally distributed data , e.g . Functional Walk Test , compare use Poisson regression . Statistical analysis perform Stata IC 13 . Statistical assistance available Department Epidemiology RCSI . Ethical Approval Ethical approval obtain CRC Ethics committee Informed Consent A write explanation study core control group provide parent/guardian participant . The information present manner easy understand outline risk benefit study clearly . Each parent participant give opportunity ask question write verbally parent/guardian sign consent form . Refusal participate study affect client 's general physiotherapy care CRC way . Participants The control group work focus balance specific core stability work physiotherapy four-week control period . They receive usual physiotherapy care period . Participants initially assign control group offer participate Core Stability group control period assessment complete . Therefore , study participant ( intervention Control group ) give opportunity avail 'Core Stability ' physiotherapy group programme . Each group attend number assessment ( 1 pre assessment 1 post assessment ) Data Collection Protection All data collect study restrict circumstance list signed consent form . The procedure place relation data storage processing Gait Laboratory Physiotherapy Department CRC follow . Identifying information store CRC secure server . Potential Risks During Balance assessment gait laboratory , marker place skin adhesive tape . Taking may cause slight discomfort . To alleviate adhesive removal spray use . The gait lab balance assessment design measure dynamic balance . Therefore , participant ask task may challenge . They supervise time carry assessment independent assessor . Stand assistance provide require safety . The 'Core Stability ' physiotherapy group intervention programme may mentally physically challenge participant . It involve concentration repetition activity . The group carry supervision two paediatric senior physiotherapist work regularly CP population . These physiotherapist strong knowledge base population 's physical limitation . They also experience encourage motivate paediatric client carry challenge activity .</detailed_description>
