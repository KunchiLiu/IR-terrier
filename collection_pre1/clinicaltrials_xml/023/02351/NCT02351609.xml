	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoke significant health threat . To eliminate disparity cancer burden , smoke rate must reduce among population smoke disproportionately concentrate : low socioeconomic status ( SES ) . The investigator apply two method use field health disparity challenge promote smoke cessation among low SES smoker . These include : 1 ) Patient navigation ; patient navigator often lay person , work pay employee , guide patient health care system 2 ) Financial incentives ; investigator propose provide monetary incentive : $ 250 smoking cessation within 6 month study enrollment , $ 500 additional 6 month abstinence initial cessation . The investigator recruit/randomize 352 smoker randomize controlled trial compare combination Patient Navigation ( deliver 6 month ) Financial Incentives versus Enhanced Traditional Care control condition ( smoke cessation brochure/list cessation resource ) . The RCT take place among adult daily smoker see past year BMC primary care practice , primary outcome smoking cessation one year . Follow-up telephone , group , occur 6 , 12 , 18 month enrollment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cigarette smoke highly significant health threat , responsible &gt; 480,000 death US year , many due cancer , large cause preventable morbidity mortality US . Primary care setting provide opportunity reach large proportion low-income smoker , 61 % smoker engage medical care . The propose project address under-utilization available smoking cessation service occur despite considerable interest among low-income patient quitting/receiving help quitting . This intervention potential increase reach exist service turn , improve public 's health . Patient financial incentive , yet use standard care health promotion , research stage various type condition . Financial incentives effective promote smoke cessation ; extensively study among low SES smoker . Financial incentives behavioral economic intervention effective promote smoke cessation , increase cessation rate 3-fold compare incentive . The investigator believe financial incentive merit study , particularly low SES population . Incentives complete smoke cessation programs/achieving abstinence may particularly effective among low SES smoker : 1 ) alleviate financial strain prevents low SES smoker quit ( study show stress financial problem prevent patient quit , even though quit smoking could save people large amount money ) ; 2 ) promote short-term abstinence among smoker mental illness substance use , many low SES smoker ; 3 ) provide substitute reinforcer smoking ( e.g. , lieu hobby , physical activity , work satisfaction ) often absent environment low SES smoker 4 ) provide extrinsic motivation patient quit smoking , may particularly effective among low SES smoker , many recent pilot study find low level intrinsic motivation . Our strategy combine financial incentive patient navigation , latter may `` supercharge '' former , two intervention may work complementary way . The investigator posit incentive augment people 's willingness connect navigator , navigator put people touch resources/environments incentives work . Patient navigation hold promise intervention reduce cancer disparity , alone may insufficient promote smoke cessation . Patient navigator often lay person community guide patient health care system receive appropriate service . While patient navigation show effective intervention reduce health care disparity , prior patient navigation study limit realms cancer screen diagnosis . Preliminary finding pilot RCT patient navigation promote smoke cessation among low SES minority primary care patient Boston Medical Center suggest potent intervention may need . While patient navigator able link 37 % patient treatment , unable contact meaningfully connect 53 % patient . Thus , financial incentive may use increase participant motivation connect patient navigator . Combining financial incentive patient navigation may effective approach promote cessation among low SES minority smoker . Multicomponent intervention show promise change health behavior general , reduce health disparity . Barriers behavior change among socially disadvantage person may large single intervention effective . The investigator therefore choose implement two intervention component , financial incentive patient navigation , show promise smoking cessation , currently apply health disparity field health condition . Our objective hypothesis : Specific Aim I : To determine whether patient navigation financial incentives increase rate primary care patient engage smoke cessation treatment . H1 : Compared control patient , assign intervention likely engage smoke cessation treatment six month post-enrollment . Specific Aim II : To determine whether patient navigation financial incentives increase rate primary care patient quit smoking ( primary outcome ) , define biochemically confirm cessation twelve month use salivary cotinine level . H1 : Compared ETC patient , assign patient navigation/financial incentive intervention likely abstinent 12 month post-enrollment .</detailed_description>
