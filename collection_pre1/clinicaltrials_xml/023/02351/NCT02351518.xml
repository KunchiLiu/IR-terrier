	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) affect 1.5 million patient per year United States , result 50,000 death 230,000 hospitalization annually . Approximately 90,000 patient suffer permanent impairment half experience short-term disability . Secondary injury process play critical role development ischemia trauma central nervous system occur hours-to-days primary insult . Ischemia lead cerebral infarction stroke . Ischemia describe single important secondary insult identify histologically approximately 90 % patient die follow close head injury . Several factor result post-traumatic cerebral ischemia identify : increase intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , systemic arterial hypotension , cerebral vasospasm . Cerebral vasospasm describe sustained arterial narrowing . Clinically , onset new worsen neurological symptom reliable indicator cerebral vasospasm follow ruptured cerebral aneurysm . However , cerebral vasospasm often unrecognized patient suffer moderate severe TBI . These patient frequently alter mental status due primary brain injury . In addition , require narcotic pain paralytic and/or sedative mechanical ventilator airway protection . Thus , rely neurological exam observe deteriorate neurological sign consistent post-traumatic vasospasm ( PTV ) reliable . While etiology outcome patient vasospasm secondary rupture aneurysm well document , clinical significance PTV TBI unknown . A good understanding role cerebral autoregulation development cerebral vasospasm could provide answer . This proposal pilot observational study describe association impairment cerebral autoregulation measure near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) development clinically significant vasospasm patient moderate severe TBI . The information serve preliminary data study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : 1 . To determine impaired cerebral autoregulation measure NIRS associate clinically significant vasospasm patient moderate severe TBI ; 2 . To determine sensitivity specificity NIRS detect clinically significant vasospasm Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) ultrasound follow CT brain angiography diffusion-weighted brain MRI gold standard . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine relationship impaired cerebral autoregulation outcome ; 2 . To determine relationship impaired cerebral autoregulation , clinically significant vasospasm outcomes Clinical observation The subject continuously monitor INVOS NIRS system within first 24 hour admission 7 day subject still STC . If decreased cerebral oxygenation detect NIRS , TCDs offer family consider part routine clinical care . If vasospasm detect TCD , CT brain angiography offer family angiographic confirmation consider part routine clinical care . If vasospasm confirm CT brain angiography , diffusion-weighted MRI offer family evaluate cerebral ischemia/infarction consider part routine clinical care . Laboratory evaluation All patient least twice daily measurement serum electrolyte , blood count , arterial blood gas , coagulation profile per standard care . Culture result record . No test procedure order research purpose . Patient Management All enrol patient admit Neurotrauma Critical Care Unit ( NTCC ) jointly manage Trauma , Critical Care Neurosurgical service . All patient manage utilizing STC Institutional Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Management Algorithm base Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines Management Severe Traumatic Brain Injury . Other consults obtain clinically indicate . Questionnaires / Assessment tool Functional outcome use Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale ( GOS-E ) assess STC Outpatient Clinic part standard care . An early functional outcome assessment obtain GOS-E form complete STC Outpatient Clinic within 6 week post hospital discharge day . A mid functional outcome assessment obtain GOS-E form complete STC Outpatient Clinic 6 week 3 month post hospital discharge day . A late functional outcome assessment obtain GOS-E form complete STC Outpatient Clinic 3 month 6 month post hospital discharge day . Finally , late functional outcome assessment obtain GOS-E form complete STC Outpatient Clinic 6 month post-hospital discharge day . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS / ANALYSIS OF DATA The goal pilot study determine impaired cerebral autoregulation measure NIRS associate development clinically significant vasospasm patient moderate severe TBI . By enrol 100 patient study , expect estimate correlation within 0.098 probability least 95 % . In study , primary secondary outcome may classify two category : binary continuous . In first step , quantitative descriptive statistic use initially study characteristic patient association clinical outcome ( e.g . vasospasm ) various demographic clinicopathologic variable age , gender injury severity score . For binary data , chi-square Fisher 's exact test use identify difference . For continuous variable , t-tests analysis variance ( ANOVA ) use determine significant association . These univariate test do significance level 0.05 . In addition construct 95 % confidence interval correlation impair cerebral autoregulation measure NIRS clinically significant vasospasm , investigator also explore potential risk factor associate impaired cerebral autoregulation impair cerebral autoregulation associate vasospasm . To end , correlation analyze use logistic regression model various demographic clinicopathologic variable independent variable . The stepwise regression procedure use identify potential risk factor incidence vasospasm . To evaluate validity NIRs assessment method vasospasm , investigator measure agreement TCD NIRS use kappa statistic .</detailed_description>
