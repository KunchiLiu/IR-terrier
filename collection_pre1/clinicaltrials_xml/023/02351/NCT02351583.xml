	<brief_summary>Preeclampsia disease pregnancy affect 3 % 8 % pregnancy major cause maternal perinatal morbidity mortality . Characterized alter placentation subsequent release inflammatory mediator lead generalized endothelial dysfunction . It accept endothelial dysfunction herald clinical manifestation preeclampsia . The side-stream darkfield ( SDF ) microscopy device emit 550 nm green light depth region interest 500 um . Green light absorb erythrocytes appear black . SDF well-known non-invasive tool study microcirculatory change . It use many situation especially sepsis septic shock patient . Near-infra-red spectroscopy ( NIRS ) device , measure absorbance near-infra-red ( NIR ) light tissue perfuse oxygenated blood , capable measuring change parenchymal volume tissue . It use many situation ( include pregnant patient ) reflect tissue oxygenation . The investigator plan use SDF NIRS tool study microcirculatory change preeclamptic subject normal pregnant subject . If two device able determine change stand baseline future study field .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study procedure : - Consented time enrollment study , hospital admission delivery . - Demographic data , medical history , obstetrical history , prenatal history delivery information obtain medical record subject - Proteinuria , Placental weight , BMI , Birth weight gender , mother smoker , clinical parameter preeclampsia , severity preeclampsia , uterine artery Doppler result collect medical record . - SDF NIRS application do . Measurements : Sidestream dark field ( SDF ) The side-stream darkfield camera ( CytoCam ) put subject tongue 5-10 minute . Multiple picture small blood vessel take . Two field select include least 2 arteriole 2 venule . Arterioles identify high-flow vessel direction flow large diameter vessel small diameter vessel , reverse true venule . Furthermore , arteriole distinguish venule difference erythrocyte flow velocity , substantially high arteriole venule . At least 2 arteriole 2 venule take captured image sequence measure blood vessel diameter . The diameter blood vessel determine use image processing software specifically design analysis microcirculation . The diameter microvessels determine draw perpendicular line one side luminal vessel wall 3 separate location . The functional capillary index ( FCD ) microvascular flow index ( MFI ) calculate well . The FCD define total length perfuse capillary per mm2 . The MFI use describe different flow velocity venules observation field . This reproducible validated index base semi-quantitative scoring ( 0=no flow , 1=intermittent flow , 2=sludging flow , 3=continuous flow 4=high flow ) flow pattern large ( &gt; 50 μm ) , medium ( 25-50 μm ) small ( 10-25 μm , include capillary ) venule . Intermittent flow characterize discontinuous flow pattern erythrocytes systolic heart contraction , halt ( even reverse ) diastolic phase . In sludging flow , individual erythrocyte different low continuous velocity easily distinguish . Continuous flow characterize uninterrupted , uniform laminar flow pattern erythrocyte still distinguish . With high flow , velocity erythrocyte exceed capture rate camera therefore individual erythrocyte trace anymore appear black column cell . CytoCam product register FDA number D186803 Class1 exempt . This product intend used visualization micro-circulation tissue orifice human body may non-invasively accessed cutaneous surface . Near-infra-red spectroscopy ( NIRS ) Artinis PortaLite OxySoft softwear Artinis system develop customizable NIRS device measure tissue oxygenation saturation ( StO2 ) muscle brain tissue . This device customize term emitter wavelength ( 5 available , NIR range ) configuration ( 2 emitter @ 30 , 35 , 40 mm detector ) . Critically , unlike commercially available NIRS device clinical care , Artinis device allow exportation actual absorbance waveform @ 15 Hz sample rate . Thus , Artinis PortaLite OxySoft softwear use research , clinical care . The NIRS probe apply one patient 's thenar muscle patient forehead tissue oxygenation ( TOI ) record 5 minute .</detailed_description>
