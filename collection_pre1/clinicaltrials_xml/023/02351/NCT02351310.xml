	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate effect antenatal corticosteroid administration ( ACS ) vs. placebo patient threaten deliver prematurely well-established gestational age 22 0/7 23 6/7 week time admission . If delivery safely delay least 3 hour contraindication steroid administration , patient eligible randomize . Randomization blind patient staff care patient stratify gestational age : 22 0/7 22 6/7 week 23 0/7 week 23 6/7 week . Randomized patient assignment either active drug placebo dose frequency : - 2 dos Betamethasone , 12 mg intramuscularly ( IM ) , 24 hour apart , hospital occasionally occur betamethasone unavailable - - 4 dos Dexamethasone IM 6 mg , 12 hour apart . Remainder care discretion clinician . Randomized 22 0/7 - 22 6/7 : For patient randomize 22 0/7 22 6/7 week undelivered &gt; 24 0/7 week , decision whether administer additional course course ACS also discretion clinician . Randomized 23 0/7 23 6/7 : For patient randomize 23 0/7 23 6/7 week remain undelivered &gt; 24 0/7 week &lt; 1 week study medication administer , second blind set medications/placebos provide . For patient receive Betamethasone ( dexamethasone ) placebo provide receive placebo Betamethasone provide . ( dose describe 3.4.3 ) . In group , time &gt; 24 0/7 week less one week previous dose , clinician feel patient still risk delivering , second blind set study drug administer . This allow patient receive least one actual course ACS undelivered 24w0d . In group , patient remains undelivered &gt; 25 week , administration open label course ACS discretion MD . Primary Outcome study composite morbidity mortality . The N study 68 ( 34 group )</detailed_description>
