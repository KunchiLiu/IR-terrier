	<brief_summary>This study 7-day randomize , double-blind proof-of-concept pilot study nitrous oxide vs. midazolam 40 adult ( 20-60 year ) bipolar disorder ( BD ) ( type I II ) . Ongoing pharmacological psychosocial treatment may continue , provide initiate significantly modify precede 2 week . Participants ' current treatment prescribe clinical psychiatrist modify interfered study . The study involve 3 visit . During study visit 1 , participant complete screen ensure study eligibility . This do use interview measure . During study visit 2 , participant complete anthropomorphic measurement , measurement endothelial function , screen blood work , ECGs , anaesthesia screener . During study visit 3 , participant receive treatment ( nitrous oxide midazolam ) , complete MRI scan , complete interview measure self-reports . There anthropomorphic measurement take well . The participant require complete phone interview self-reports subsequent 7 day . There 4 main prediction : 1 . Nitrous oxide significantly reduce depression symptom vs. midazolam . 2 . Nitrous oxide significantly increase frontal cortical perfusion vs. midazolam . 3 . Lower perfusion frontal cortical region baseline associate great improvement depression symptom follow nitrous oxide treatment . 4 . Poorer endothelial function associate great improvement depression symptom follow nitrous oxide treatment .</brief_summary>
