	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease common diagnosis elderly population associate significant morbidity health care cost . The prevalence rate increase age 40 % adult age &gt; 65 year . In elderly population ( age 65 ) , CKD associate high burden comorbid condition frailty . The prevalence frailty high CKD patient rat double early stage nearly 6 time higher beyond stage 3b . Previously report frailty mortality rate 18 % 3 year 47 % 7 year compare mortality rate non frail individual 3 % 12 % respectively . In study , investigator investigate effect multidisciplinary intervention upon frail elderly patient CKD yet dialysis . This intervention include best medical care , nutrition , physiotherapy , social , psychological spiritual support .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A multilevel , multidisciplinary intervention require assist frail CKD patient give complexity condition . However , optimal method intervention well defined literature . It previously describe dialysis improve ( often time worsen ) outcome frail patient renal disease ( 41 ) . The nowadays trend try optimise decrease frailty initiation dialysis . If possible , conservative palliative approach envisage . Regardless , combine geriatric nephrological expertise may help identify patient high risk early death approach indicate ( 42 ) . Major medical society regularly review publish guideline medical management chronic kidney disease . Most reputable guideline KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline Evaluation Management Chronic Kidney Disease ( 43 ) The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative ( NKF KDOQI , ( 44 ) ) . In Canada , field expert review current evidence provide similar recommendation ( 45 ) . In summary , guideline provide expert opinion treatment target treatment CKD patient accent control cardiovascular risk factor ( hypertension , diabetes , dyslipidemia ) , lifestyle management , control CKD complication ( proteinuria , anemia , mineral metabolism ) , initiation renal replacement therapy . Lifestyle management probably one important intervention CKD population . First foremost , empower patient take control live become active partner treatment . Smoking cessation , weight reduction , dietary protein control , alcohol intake , exercise , control salt intake prove improve outcome part current guideline . Regular physical exercise improve physical fitness , walk capacity , cardiovascular parameter ( e.g . blood pressure heart rate ) , health-related quality life , nutritional parameter ( 48 ) . Physical activity also protective depression ( 49 ) . In case frail patient , usually sedentary , multiple cardiac risk factor , recommend begin gradual exercise supervision . Nutrition must target frail elderly CKD decrease energy intake associate high stage CKD ( 50 ) . Though CKD non dialysis population , nutrition supplementation formally assess , general population frail elderly evaluate protein supplementation . Tieland et al ( 51 ) randomize 65 frail elderly protein versus placebo supplementation group 24 week . January 11 , 2015 revise The protein supplementation group benefit respect weight gain muscle strength . However , resistive exercise training couple protein supplementation , body weight gain achieve . Furthermore , Tieland et al ( 52 ) randomize 62 frail elderly two group , receive exercise train one group receive protein supplement . A 0.7 kg weight gain record protein supplement none control group . The sustainability benefit survival weight gain determine , especially CKD non dialysis patient . Thus , investigator propose exercise protein supplementation benefit CKD frail old population . Frail patient without CKD risk experience psychological distress . Acknowledging one 's limitation , inability perform certain social standard , lose function compare friend family member within age group , depend 's support envisage high risk factor depression and/or psychological ailment . Psychological distress associate decrease quality life bad outcome . Anxiety depression 2 major compound psychological distress . Patients screen two easy use scale : GAD-7 ( anxiety ) PHQ-9 ( depression ) . Were identify , condition treat Psychiatry Geriatrics service . Disability best assess use standard ten variable address Barthel scale ( 56 ) : presence absence fecal incontinence , presence absence urinary incontinence , help need grooming , help need toilet use , help need feeding , help need transfer ( e.g . chair bed ) , help need walking , help need dressing , help need climb stair , help need bathing .

Severe cognitive impaired patient lack insight capacity limit capacity rehabilitate . MoCA ( 57 ) well validated tool identify cognitive impairment , widely available many language , recommend The Canadian Consensus Guidelines Diagnosis Treatment Dementia detection Mild Cognitive Impairment Alzheimer 's disease . A cut-off &gt; 17 generally use exclude severe dementia . A language specific MoCA instruction administer test available online http : //www.mocatest.org/ . The original English version reproduce Appendix 3 . The primary objective propose study assess effect intensive multidisciplinary intervention survival , hospitalization need start dialysis . Secondary objective include assessment intervention different stage sarcopenia measurement physical function nutritional parameter evaluate effect intervention among frail CKD population .</detailed_description>
