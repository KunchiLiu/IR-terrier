	<brief_title>Inhaled Beclomethasone After Community-Acquired Respiratory Viral Infection Lung Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community-acquired respiratory viral ( CARV ) infection lung transplantation associate increase risk development chronic lung allograft dysfunction ( CLAD ) lung transplantation . The exact mechanism whereby CARV infection increase risk unknown . We propose viral infection result airway epithelial cell injury expression injury-response gene provide signal initiate immunologic non-immunologic pathway result airway remodel characteristic obliterative bronchiolitis , predominant pathology CLAD . Systemic inhale corticosteroid frequently use anti-inflammatory agent treat peribronchiolar inflammation see viral bronchiolitis . Beneficial effect corticosteroid report , demonstrate lung transplant recipient . The aim single center , randomize , double blind , placebo control study evaluate short long term effect 6 month course inhale beclomethasone adult lung transplant recipient CARV infection .</detailed_description>
