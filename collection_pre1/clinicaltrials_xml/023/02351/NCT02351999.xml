	<brief_title>Clinical Study TSP Crosser System Transseptal Access Left Atrial Catheter Navigation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transseptal ( TS ) catheterization critical step leave atrial ( LA ) intervention ( atrial fibrillation ablation , LA appendage closure , mitral valve intervention ) . The availability suitable tool technique essential safely perform TS puncture , effectively deliver radiofrequency lesion , deploy LA device , anticipate difficult procedural situation complication may arise . This study intend assess safety , performance usability TSP Crosser System facilitate access leave atrium catheter navigation pulmonary vein ( PV ) catheter base ablation procedure treatment atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . Moreover , study assess impact TSP Crosser System procedural time , include time achieve leave atrial access , total procedure time , total fluoroscopy time , leave atrial mapping time radiofrequency isolation time . The study prospective , multicenter , non-randomized single arm interventional investigation . Enrolled subject meet study inclusion/exclusion criterion evaluate catheter map ablation procedure follow release hospital post procedure per institutional standard care . After 30 day , patient contact telephone obtain information clinical condition adverse event ; necessary , clinic visit may perform required physician .</detailed_description>
