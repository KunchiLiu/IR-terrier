	<brief_summary>HABIT-II feasibility study aim home monitoring patient heart failure . B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) strong correlation severity heart failure . Lower BNP level closely associate well clinical outcome . The goal HABIT-II demonstrate result daily patient self-testing BNP home provide sufficient information guide physicians modify therapy lower BNP level time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HF Assessment With BNP Home : Part II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm multi-center pilot study . Subjects heart failure ( HF ) discharge follow acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) event subject see outpatient worsen sign symptom HF , meet enrollment criterion , candidate study . Subjects HF reduce leave ventricular ejection fraction ( HFREF ) subject HF preserve ejection fraction ( HFPEF ) eligible . The eventual objective area research demonstrate HF subject assist frequent B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) measurement integrate home health management system improve clinical outcome . The specific objective study demonstrate frequent BNP measurement integrate home health management system use physician modify intensify therapy lead reduce risk ADHF event measure reduction BNP level . Subjects ask test BNP home every day period 180 day use AlereTM HeartCheck System ( Test System ) . In addition BNP , weight sign symptom HF collect day test . The HeartCheck data transmit via secure wireless protocol HealthCOM health monitoring portal available medical staff . Enrollment goal 110 evaluable subject . Potential subject meet study 's inclusion exclusion criterion interview interest participate study . Potential subject show interest study judge willingness , ability reliability perform fingerstick BNP measurement every day 180 day home able report result use HeartCheck system . All qualify subject agree participate provide Informed Consent train use HeartCheck system include daily BNP measurement , daily body weight measurement , daily health survey question . Subjects successfully complete train judged proficiency study activity . If find proficient ; use system home . After short lead-in period , algorithm ( similar concept move average ) apply BNP data result BNP-based parameter alert create parameter rising , period sustain high BNP . The patient 's physician medical staff require evaluate BNP base alert notification determine change HF treatment advisable . All change HF treatment , without BNP-based alert , discretion treat physician medical staff institution . The primary endpoint study significant lower BNP across population . At approximately 1 , 3 6 month enrollment , subject return clinic physical examination , clinical assessment , review interval medical status health care provider . In addition , warrant , home health care professional may visit subject home time study additional counseling training may benefit compliance protocol .</detailed_description>
