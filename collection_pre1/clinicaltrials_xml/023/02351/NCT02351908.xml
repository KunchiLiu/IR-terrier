	<brief_summary>The purpose study observe safety Truvada® ( TDF/FTC ) relation impact kidney function combine different Integrase Inhibitors ( Dolutegravir , Elvitegravir/Cobicistat Raltegravir ) , give patient commence treatment HIV infection first time . All three combination ( Raltegravir + Truvada® , Dolutegravir + Truvada® Stribild® , single pill contain Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Truvada® ) currently recommend national guide-lines use standard clinical practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study monitor kidney function , compare safety effectiveness Truvada® take Dolutegravir , Elvitegravir/Cobicistat Raltegravir , first 48 week treatment HIV-1 antiretrovirals naïve patient . The safety well drug combination tolerate determine base physical examination , laboratory test , question problem participant might experience study . As part trial , level HIV-1 blood urinary marker kidney function inflammatory marker measure various time study . The total duration participant involvement trial 48 week , 45 day screen baseline visit . Participants need visit clinic 6 time within 48 week . Once participant confirm eligible participate study , participant attend baseline visit ( day 1 ) randomly assign receive one three treatment list : - Treatment Arm 1 : Stribild® ( EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF ) 1 tablet day - Treatment Arm 2 : Isentress® ( Raltegravir 400 mg ) 1 tablet twice day + Truvada® 1 tablet day - Treatment Arm 3 : Tivicay® ( Dolutegravir 50 mg ) 1 tablet day + Truvada® 1 tablet day</detailed_description>
