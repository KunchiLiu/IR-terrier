	<brief_summary>The purpose trial evaluate efficacy lanreotide locally evolve and/or metastatic MCC national prospective multicentre phase II study ( centre belong skin cancer task force French Society Dermatology namely `` Groupe de Cancérologie Cutanée de la Société Française de Dermatologie '' ) . This one-arm study , primary endpoint overall response lanreotide , follow A'Hern plan one step ( A'Hern RP . Sample size table exact single-stage phase II design . Stat Med 2001 , 20:859-66 ) main evaluation 12 week population 35 patient . The investigator make assumption 40 % success rate 3 month would desirable , 20 % le treatment would unacceptable . It give trial size 35 patient cut-off 12 patient . Over 12 patient lanreotide consider effective . The lanreotide treatment ( Somatuline LP 120 mg inject subcutaneously every 28 day ) provide IPSEN Pharma laboratory . An ancillary immunohistochemistry study somatostatine receptor 2,3,5 , dopamine receptor 1,2 polyomavirus MCPyV bring new data neuroendocrine tumour potentially provide new therapeutic perspective . The result study may : - determine whether somatostatin analogue may help treat locally advanced and/or metastatic MCC ; - address whether correlation positive SPECT-CT ( octreoscan ) assessment therapeutic response lanreotide ; - evaluate place TEP-CT SPECT-CT MCC evaluation/staging ; - evaluate future study , ancillary data , analogue hybrid molecule ; - consider , positive result obtain study , somatostatin analogue adjuvant treatment surgery primary MCC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The efficacy consider success patient positive response lanreotide . Primary criterion Positive response 3 month define accord RECIST 1.1 criterion ( clinical TDM evaluation do 3 month ) : complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) 3 month . Secondary Objectives : - Assessment primary criterion M6 , M9 , M12 , M18 M24 - Description overall survival time progression - Assessment efficacy follow radiological exam stag disease : SPECT-CT TEP-CT - Description correlation SPECT-CT result ( positivity negativity ) response treatment , correlation TEP-CT result response treatment - Description safety tolerability lanreotide study Population Methods Experimental plan French national prospective multicentre phase II one-arm study . This one-arm study , primary endpoint overall response lanreotide , follow A'Hern plan one step . Population Inclusion criterion - Histologically confirm neuroendocrine carcinoma skin ( Merkel cell carcinoma ) inoperable local-regional disease distant metastatic disease ( stag IIIB IV AJCC 2010 ) , cerebral nervous system metastases allow . - First line treatment - Measurable disease : least 20 mm conventional technique 10 mm spiral CT scan - Age 18 year old ; - WHO performance status ECOG 0-3 - premenopausal patient must use effective contraception - No prior malignancy within 5 year except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell carcinoma situ cancer cervix - No concurrent chemotherapy , immunotherapy hormone therapy . - At least 4 week since adjuvant chemotherapy , 14 day since radiotherapy 2 week since surgery - Biological function : absolute neutrophil count least 1000/mm3 , platelet count least 100000/mm3 , haemoglobin least 9g/dl ( transfusion allow ) , bilirubin great 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , SGOT SGPT great 2.5 time ULN , untreated chronic liver disease , creatinine great 1.5 time ULN , untreated chronic renal disease , untreated diabetes infection - Written inform consent Exclusion criterion - previous hypersensibility lanreotide treatment - complicate untreated cholelithiasis - pregnancy breast-feeding - patient treat cyclosporine Studied treatment Lanreotide 120 mg sub-cutaneously every 28 day 12 week , follow injection every 28 day response positive progression . The expected rate positive response 50 % patient 3 month 25 % patient 1 year . Evaluation Criteria follow-up study The inclusion do 2 year follow-up patient plan 2 year , optimal assessment progression free survival case response treatment , total study duration 4 year . Data collection - inclusion : patient 's demography medical history ; clinical anatomopathological data primary MCC ; blood count , platelet , electrolyte , glucose , creatinine , transaminase , bilirubin , ECG , pregnancy test woman childbearing age ; - Clinical examination measure possible target lesion ( tumor cutaneous metastasis ) use RECIST 1.1 criterion inclusion M1 , M2 M3 every 3 month first year ( M6 , M9 M12 ) every 6 month second year follow-up ( M18 M24 ) ; - Cerebral thoraco-abdominal CTscan result image ( RECIST 1.1 criterion : http : //www.recist.com/recist-in-practice/01.html ) inclusion , 3 month , every 3 month first year , every 6 month 2nd year ; - Octreoscan ( SPECT-CT ) inclusion - PET-CT inclusion</detailed_description>
