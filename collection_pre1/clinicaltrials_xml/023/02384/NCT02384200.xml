	<brief_summary>When patient go surgery remove large kidney stone ( percutaneous nephrolithotomy [ PCNL ] ) , clear whether patient benefit course prophylactic preoperative oral antibiotic ; currently use prophylactic preoperative oral antibiotic prophylactic oral antibiotic consider within standard-of-care . This study randomize patient preoperative prophylactic antibiotic antibiotic determine use preoperative prophylactic antibiotic decrease postoperative risk localize urinary tract infection ( UTI ) and/or systemic infection start urinary tract ( sepsis urosepsis ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Preoperative Prophylactic Antibiotics Prior Kidney Stone Surgery ( Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy PCNL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Study Design Overview This study multi-institutional randomize , control clinical trial course 1 week course preoperative nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystalline capsule 100 milligram twice daily lead PCNL . The control group preoperative oral antibiotic . The participate institution academic medical center United States Canada part EDGE ( Endourologic Disease Group Excellence ) research consortium , research collaborative goal produce high quality , multi-institutional study nephrolithiasis . Separate IRB approval obtain institution . UCSD coordinate institution . Member institution EDGE maintain frequent email contact one another hold monthly teleconference discus safety update , interim result , issue accrual , modification research protocols consent ( necessary ) . Treatment Assignment : Patients assign control intervention arm base predetermined allocation sequence generate computerized random number generator . Patients stratified institution permute block vary size . No clinical staff involve recruit consent patient study UCSD participate institution knowledge allocation sequence institution prior enrollment patient . To aid allocation concealment , block size vary . Standard care procedure : Patients identify base clinic visit hospital admission . All patient counsel standard treatment options— extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( ESWL ) , percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL ) ureteroscopy ( URS ) . The discussion regard treatment option subsequent care deviate routine care . Patients consent PCNL consider enrollment study enrol data collect prospectively . Patients consent prior prescription antibiotic surgery collection demographic , disease , perioperative , postoperative data . Abdominal pelvic compute tomography ( CT ) , already obtain , used delineate pre-operative stone size preoperative planning . If patient consent study use antibiotic base routine clinical practice treat urologist . Both prophylaxis preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis ( i.e . periprocedural ) consider standard care study examine difference two common practice . Investigational portion treatment : Patients randomize intervention arm prescribe nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystalline 100 mg twice daily 7 day prior PCNL final day prophylactic course 1 day prior surgery . Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystalline currently indicate treatment acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection . Antibiotics day surgery dose ampicillin IV ( 2 g ) gentamicin IV ( 5 mg/kg ) within 60 minute surgery start time . Patients penicillin allergy receive vancomycin IV ( 1 g ) instead ampicillin patient gentamicin/aminoglycoside allergy receive ceftriaxone IV ( 2 g ) instead gentamicin . Postoperative antibiotic absence infection &lt; 24 hour IV antibiotic . Control patient receive perioperative ampicillin IV ( 2 g ) gentamicin IV ( 5 mg/kg ) ( vancomycin ( 1 g ) /ceftriaxone ( 2 g ) , indicate ) intervention arm , control patient prescribed course preoperative oral antibiotic . Central randomization take place UCSD lead site . Randomization occur block randomization block size 4 . Standard care procedures Patients PCNL perform standard fashion , without deviation standard care . Per usual practice treat surgeon , percutaneous access kidney obtain either Interventional Radiology operate surgeon . At time surgery , urine renal pelvis , urine bladder , stone send culture . Placement renal drainage device ( ureteral stent , nephrostomy tube , nephroureteral stent ) leave discretion surgeon . Post-operatively , patient admit hospital monitor per usual clinical procedure . Pre-operative CBC , basic metabolic panel ( chem 7 ) well Postoperative day 1 , CBC , basic metabolic panel ( chem 7 ) . laboratory test dictate patient ' clinical status per standard care—i.e . patient exhibit sign sepsis tachycardia ( &gt; 90/min ) , low systolic blood pressure ( &lt; 90 mmHg ) , fever &gt; 38.3C , hypothermia &lt; 36C , alter mental status , respiratory rate &gt; 20 min leukocytosis &gt; 12000 leukopenia ( &lt; 4000 ) , urine culture , blood culture serum lactate obtain ( per standard care ) . The patient discharge hospital per usual clinical protocol . Post-discharge patient see clinic 1-12 week surgery . Patients undergo non-contrast CT abdomen/pelvis , abdominal plain radiograph , and/or renal ultrasound postoperative period . Demographic field obtain preoperatively include age , race , gender , ASA ( American Society Anesthesiologists ) score ( comorbidity assessment ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , prior stone disease . Disease field obtain include stone size ( maximal axial coronal dimension ) , degree hydronephrosis ( mild/moderate/severe ) , history diabetes mellitus , history cardiac disease , hypertension , prior urinary tract infection , history bowel diversion , neurogenic bladder . Perioperative field include OR ( surgical ) time , type anesthesia , number access tract , use internalized ureteral stent , nephrostomy tube , nephroureteral stent , estimate blood loss , intraoperative complication . Postoperative field include postoperative maximum body temperature , heart rate , respiratory rate , urine culture result , stone culture result , stone composition , white blood cell count , serum lactate , postoperative serum creatinine , need admission intensive care unit , hospital length stay ( LOS ) , stone-free status 1-12 week postoperative imaging . Patients follow routine clinical visit part continue care . 2 . Data Collection Data collect participate site enter designate share REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) database . All patient specific information de-identified database password protect access right restrict lead investigator team site . Data collector blind treatment allocation . 3 . Data Handling The electronic data store external REDCap database . This database save separate server allow study staff non-UCSD site contribute database . Study staff create database responsible analyze study data . The coordinator site perform data entry . 4 . Data Analysis The summary statistic use describe data . Mean/95 % confidence interval report continuous variable , frequency/percentage report nominal variable . The primary outcome , rate postoperative sepsis , correspond 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) report , compare intervention control group postoperative period use Chi-squared test . Secondary outcome include rate nonseptic bacteruria , stone-free rate , LOS compare use Chi-squared test t-test indicate . The patient characteristic outcomes one-year follow record also investigate . Using 2-sided P value , statistical significance set p≤0.05 . Sepsis define defined 2012 International Guidelines Management Severe Sepsis Septic Shock 2 follow variable present temporally associate - Temp &gt; 38.3 C &lt; 36 C - Heart Rate &gt; 90/min ( least 12 hrs surgery ) - Respiratory Rate &gt; 20/min ( least 12 hrs surgery ) - Altered mental status : define lack orientation either name , place , time/date . - Systolic Blood Pressure ( SBP ) &lt; 90 mmHg , Mean Arterial Pressure &lt; 70 mmHg , SBP decrease &gt; 40 mmHg adult - WBC &gt; 12000 &lt; 4000 5 . Feasibility Time Frame This study enrollment period 2 year , presume enrollment expect complete prior date . Each site high volume stone center perform 30 PCNLs per year . 6 . Strengths This study unique randomize patient low moderate risk postoperative infection us update definition sepsis primary outcome . The limitation previous study lack randomization , exclusion patient moderate-high risk infection , less contemporary definition sepsis . It aim answer important relevant question pertain surgical management kidney stone disease prophylactic use preoperative antibiotic patient increase risk infection . It also represent broad geographic distribution patient US Canada due location participate site . 7 . Limitations The inclusion placebo pill would strengthen study able include due logistical difficulty obtain placebo identical appearance would adequate blinding . Furthermore , little benefit `` placebo effect '' objective outcome investigator seek study sign symptom sepsis septic shock .</detailed_description>
