	<brief_title>Efficacy Octreotide Blood Iron Requirements Patients With Anaemia Due Angiodysplasias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Gastrointestinal angiodysplasias important cause difficult manage bleeding , especially old patient . Angiodysplasias technical challenging manage endoscopic . Some patient blood transfusion iron infusion dependent due rebleedings despite endoscopic intervention . In clinical practice face difficulty patient know effective alternative treatment . In small cohort study octreotide appear decrease bleed episodes patient , evidence still weak integrate treatment modality daily practice . Objective : To assess efficacy octreotide decrease need blood transfusion iron infusion patient refractory anaemia due gastrointestinal bleeding angiodysplasias despite endoscopic intervention . Study design : Multicenter , randomize , open-label intervention study . Study population : 62 patient , old 45 year , refractory anaemia due bleeding angiodysplasias without possible source bleeding , blood transfusion iron infusion dependent despite endoscopic intervention oral iron supplementation . Intervention : Patients randomize ( 1:1 ) two group . The intervention group receive Octreotide 40 mg ( Sandostatin LAR ) every four week 48 week . The control group receive standard care . The last follow-up visit week 60 . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary outcome percentual decrease blood iron requirement year prior inclusion treatment period one year . The percentual decrease compare intervention control arm . Important secondary outcome percent change number rebleeds baseline endpoint percentage adverse event . An intention-to-treat analysis perform outcome .</detailed_description>
