	<brief_summary>Isometric handgrip exercise use explain effect fatigue strength activation muscle involve . Blood flow available time exercise influence fatigue process , study demonstrate change pattern muscle recruitment strength recovery exercise perform combination external total obstruction ( pressure cuff tourniquet ) blood flow . Low intensity exercise associate external partial obstruction blood flow widely use study , mainly due effect increase strength muscle hypertrophy , often comparable observed conventional exercise ( ie , without external obstruction blood flow ) High intensity . Despite vast literature method , topic need good inform underlying neuromuscular physiology effect ( strength hypertrophy ) process fatigue isometric exercise associate partial obstruction blood flow . The aim study evaluate acute effect neuromuscular response healthy adult undergoing intermittent isometric exercise protocol different level external compression . In study `` crossover '' male volunteer submit three intermittent isometric exercise protocol ( load 45 % maximum voluntary isometric strength ) associate three different level obstruction ( held pressure cuff ) blood flow ( total obstruction , partial obstruction free blood flow ) . The protocol perform three different day ( minimum 48 hour ) . Will consider acute neuromuscular response spend time failure task , electromyographic activity flexor muscle wrist finger , recovery curve maximum voluntary isometric strength exercise . The main hypothesis study exercise perform associate partial obstruction blood flow , time spend fail job similar see exercise perform free blood flow , recovery strength electromyographic activity similar observe exercise associate total obstruction blood flow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Muscle fatigue process widely disbelieve studied literature . Isometric handgrip exercise widely utilized explain effect fatigue strength activation muscle involve certain exercise . Among many factor influence process muscular fatigue , blood flow available time exercise aspect fundamental importance , study demonstrate change pattern muscle recruitment strength recovery exercise perform associated external obstruction blood flow . Resistance exercise associate partial obstruction blood flow ( ischemic exercise ) gain notoriety scientific environment , mainly due strong evidence indicating activity increase strength muscle hypertrophy , even perform low intensity load . The underlie neuromuscular mechanism effect still partially unknown , study show difference recruitment motor unit execution , relationship fatigue-strength ischemic resistance exercise . Nevertheless , still gap literature regard neuromuscular response unilateral intermittent isometric handgrip protocol failure associate task partial obstruction blood flow . Evidence suggest total obstruction blood flow decrease performance accelerates recovery isometric strength fatigue protocol , effect partial obstruction variable remain unknown . In far , seem isometric fatigue protocol associated remote obstruction ( away venue exercise ) blood flow influence acutely strength member distance , know protocol unilateral isometric fatigue associate partial complete obstruction blood flow influence acutely strength contralateral limb ( ie , subject type exercise ) . Thus , realization study justify possibility answer question still little studied , regard neuromuscular factor ischemic resistance training .</detailed_description>
