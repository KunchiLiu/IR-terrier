	<brief_summary>Approximately 70 patient HR+ advance breast cancer enrol . All patient receive either fulvestrant ( 500 mg IM every 2 week x 3 every four week ) tamoxifen ( 20 mg PO daily physician choice ) . Pre-menopausal woman must chemical menopause . Arm 1 receive palbociclib 100 mg qd , day 1-21 every 28 day . Arm 2 receive palbociclib 125 mg qd , day 1-21 every 28 day . Restaging perform every 8 week . Therapy continue PD unacceptable toxicity . Patients randomly allocate 1:1 ratio take either 100 mg 125 mg palbociclib . Randomized treatment assignment make permuted block , generate collaborate statistician Dana-Farber Cancer Institute .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically proven diagnosis breast cancer evidence metastatic locally advanced disease , amenable resection radiation therapy curative intent . Patients 18 year age old , Female patient either : Postmenopausal , define least one follow criterion : Age ≥60 year ; Age &lt; 60 year cessation regular menses least 12 consecutive month alternative pathological physiological cause ; Documented bilateral oophorectomy ; Medically confirm ovarian failure . OR Pre/perimenopausal , ie , meet criterion postmenopausal also receive ongoing treatment LHRH agonist ( goserelin leuprolide ) . The first injection occur least two week study start . Documentation ERpositive and/or PRpositive tumor ( ≥1 % positive stained cell ) base recent tumor biopsy ( unless boneonly disease , discus study PI result discordant ) utilize assay consistent local standard . Documented HER2negative tumor base local test recent tumor biopsy : HER2negative tumor determine immunohistochemistry score 0/1+ negative situ hybridization ( FISH/CISH/SISH ) define HER2/CEP17 ratio &lt; 2 single probe assessment HER2 copy number &lt; 4 . Must receive prior treatment mTOR PI3K inhibitor Up 2 prior line chemotherapy allow metastatic setting . Any number line prior hormone therapy allow Patients clear progression either tamoxifen fulvestrant receive alternate agent . Patients clear progression drug eligible . Ability skin tumor biopsy . Patients without accessible tumor biopsy consider case case basis . Patients biopsied replace ( although 5 ineligible/inevaluable patient replace ) A patient without biopsy amenable tumor must clear PI study ; 10 patient without biopsy amenable tumor allow arm study . Patients without accessible tumor biopsy must provide archived tumor recent biopsy available Bone marrow , hepatic , renal function follow : Adequate bone marrow function : leukocytes &gt; 2500/mL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/mL platelet &gt; 100,000/mL '' Adequate hepatic function : total bilirubin within normal institutional limit ( unless Gilbert 's disease elevate indirect bilirubin ) AST ( SGOT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Adequate renal function : creatinine within normal institutional limit Measurable evaluable disease define RECIST version 1.1 . Tumor lesion previously irradiate subjected locoregional therapy deem measurable progression treat site completion therapy clearly document . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 Resolution acute toxic effect prior therapy surgical procedure National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) CTCAE Grade ≤1 ( except alopecia ) Ability understand write informed consent document , willingness sign Prior treatment CDK inhibitor , and/or fulvestrant tamoxifen metastatic set clear progression . Patients advanced/metastatic , symptomatic , visceral spread , risk lifethreatening complication short term investigator assessment . Known active uncontrolled symptomatic central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases , carcinomatous meningitis , leptomeningeal disease indicate clinical symptom , cerebral edema , and/or progressive growth . Patients history CNS metastases cord compression eligible definitively treat ( eg , radiotherapy , stereotactic surgery ) clinically stable anticonvulsant steroid least 4 week randomization . Current use food drug know potent CYP3A4 inhibitor , drug know potent CYP3A4 inducer ( example , see prohibited medication section ) , drug know prolong QT interval . See prohibited med appendix 5 . Major surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , anticancer therapy within 2 week randomization . Any malignancy within 3 year prior randomization , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , carcinoma situ cervix . QTc interval &gt; 480 msec ( base mean value triplicate ECGs ) , family personal history long short QT syndrome , Brugada syndrome know history QTc prolongation Torsade de Pointes . QTc ( Bazett ) = QT/√RR Any follow within 6 month prior study enrollment : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2 , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident exclude transient ischemic attack . Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption palbociclib , history GI surgery may result intestinal blind loops patient clinically significant gastroparesis , short bowel syndrome , unresolved nausea , vomit , active inflammatory bowel disease diarrhea CTCAE v4.0 Grade &gt; 1 . Prior hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow transplantation . Abnormalities coagulation bleed diathesis , treatment anticoagulant ( safely hold biopsy ) would preclude tumor skin biopsy . For fulvestrant : Ongoing anticoagulation would preclude IM injection For tamoxifen : Documented hypercoagulable state receive anticoagulation Known possible hypersensitivity palbociclib ( CTCAE v4.0 ) . Known human immunodeficiency virus infection . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , include recent active suicidal ideation behavior , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study . Participation study involve investigational drug ( ) ( Phases 14 ) within 2 week randomization current study . Women become pregnant breastfeed whilst study . Birth control method acceptable discuss study participant .</criteria>
