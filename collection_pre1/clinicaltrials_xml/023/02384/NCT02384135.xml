	<brief_title>Age-adjusted D-dimer Cutoff Levels Rule Out Deep Vein Thrombosis : Prospective Outcome Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Suspected deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) frequent clinical problem remain diagnostic challenge . The diagnostic approach DVT rely sequential diagnostic test , assessment clinical probability , plasma D-dimer measurement , compression ultrasonography ( CUS ) . Clinical probability fair predictive accuracy either evaluate implicitly clinical prediction rule useful identify patient low prevalence DVT usually fully investigated non invasive test . The D-dimer test extensively evaluate exclusion DVT , particularly outpatient . ELISA D-dimer second-generation latex agglutination ( immuno-turbidimetric test ) remarkably high sensitivity prove safe first-line test association clinical probability rule DVT outcome study . The clinical usefulness D-dimer define proportion patient DVT may rule normal result determine specificity . However , ELISA second-generation latex agglutination ( immuno-turbidimetric test ) test quite limited overall specificity around 35 % 40 % .3 Therefore , many investigator try increase D-dimer threshold particular elderly patient increase rate patient diagnosis could exclude easy inexpensive test . Several study show D-dimer level increase age , turn decreased specificity D-dimer test usual threshold elderly , thus less useful test exclude DVT pulmonary embolism ( PE ) old patient . For example , ELISA D-dimer able rule PE 60 % patient age less 40 year , 5 % patient age 80 . In study , raise cutoff value various point 600 microg/L 1000 microg/L increase specificity , come cost safety false negative test result . In analysis , however , stratification make clinical probability sample small . Recently , investigator retrospectively assess value progressive cutoff adjust age wide sample 1712 patient suspect PE . This `` new '' cutoff define D-Dimer test positivity patient multiply patient 's age 10 . All patient D-Dimer level 500 microg/L , patient 50 year whose D-Dimer level inferior age multiply 10 consider negative D-Dimer test . Using conventional cutoff , VIDAS® D-Dimer test negative ( 500 microg/L ) 512/1712 patient ( 29.9 % ) none PE initial workup three-month follow-up period . Using cutoff adjust age ( cutoff D-Dimer test positivity equal age multiply ten , microg/L ) , figure follow . D-Dimer level adjust cutoff 615/1712 patient ( 35.9 % , number need test 2.8 ) . This represent statistically significant 20.1 % increase number patient D-Dimer test consider negative , p=0.0002 . Of 615 patient , 5 PE initial workup ( 0.8 % , 95 percent confidence interval 0.4 1.9 % ) . In recently publish prospective outcome validation study age-adjusted cutoff patient clinically suspect PE.13 The study include 3300 patient suspect PE show three-month thromboembolic risk patient nonhigh ( unlikely ) clinical probability D-Dimer level 500 microg/L age-adjusted cutoff 0.3 % ( 95 % CI : 0.1 5 1.7 % ) . These result line one found patient D-dimer level usual cutoff 500 microg/L : 0.1 % ( 95 % CI : 0.0 % 0.7 % ) . Moreover , patient 75 year age-adjusted cutoff allow increase five-fold number patient PE could exclude without image test . As PE DVT often consider similar disease , investigator plan prospective outcome study progressive `` new '' cutoff ( age X 10 µg/L ) use patient suspected DVT . In multicentre study , clinical probability assess Wells score ( Table 1 ) ELISA D-dimer test ( Vidas D-dimer Exclusion® test ( Biomérieux , Marcy l'Etoile , Paris , France ) immuno-turbidimetric test Innovance D-dimer ( Siemens , Munich , Germany ) perform . Patients nonhigh `` unlikely '' clinical probability Wells score normal `` new '' D-dimer cutoff consider DVT , follow three-months ass possible VTE recurrence . The main outcome rate thromboembolic event formal 3-month follow-up patient anticoagulated basis strategy . Patients D-dimer measurement age-adjusted cutoff investigate CUS currently admit .</detailed_description>
