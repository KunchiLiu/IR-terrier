	<brief_summary>Participants study diagnose advanced breast cancer become bad treated fulvestrant . Participants estrogen-receptor positive disease , complete menopause . There information research lab suggest drug work like MLN9708 help kill breast cancer cell treat fulvestrant . The purpose study determine proper dose well good bad effect MLN9708 give combination fulvestrant . The Investigators also want learn drug combination affect tumor cell . The amount MLN9708 participant receive determine enter study . Three different dos give different participant . The Investigators expect enroll total 12-18 people .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Combination MLN9708 Fulvestrant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer disease progression Fulvestrant , continuation endocrine therapy would appropriate treatment , treat combination MLN9708 ( proteasome inhibitor ) Fulvestrant ( anti-estrogen ) . Subjects visceral soft tissue disease tumor biopsy treatment Fulvestrant prior initiation MLN9708 confirm ER/PR/HER2 status , provide baseline specimen molecular analysis . A biopsy tumor obtain 2 day treatment MLN9708 plus Fulvestrant ( i.e . day 3 ) . Patients bone-only disease eligible study , biopsied . The Investigators propose 3x3 dose-escalation trial ass safety efficacy Fulvestrant three dose level MLN9708 ( 2.3 , 3 , 4mg ) Subjects treat Fulvestrant ( 500mg ) every four week day 1 . The dose MLN9708 start 2.3mg , 50 % phase 3 dose another ongoing study . If 2.3mg MLN9708 induce grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity , grade 4 hematologic toxicity CTCAE v4.0 ( Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , version 4.0 ) 3 subject treat 1 cycle , Investigators treat another 3 subject combination Fulvestrant MLN9708 ( 3mg ) ; grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity , grade 4 hematologic toxicity CTCAE v4.0 see first cycle , Investigators treat another 3 subject Fulvestrant MLN9708 ( 4mg , phase 3 dose ) . If dose-limiting toxicity observe 1/3 subject , Investigators treat additional 3 subject dose . If dose-limiting toxicity see 2 6 subject dose level , dose level consider maximum tolerated dose , total 6 subject treat prior dose . Plasma pharmacokinetic profile MLN9708 determine 21 day first dose combination . Pre- post- treatment tumor biopsy formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded . Tissue section analyze H &amp; E ( Hematoxylin eosin ) stain immunohistochemistry use antibody marker proliferation , apoptosis , estrogen receptor alpha activation , endoplasmic reticulum stress , polyubiquitin . Proteasome activity whole blood determine use sample acquire prior treatment initiation , day 3 . Tumor-specific plasma DNA also measure prior treatment initiation first two dos MLN9708 .</detailed_description>
