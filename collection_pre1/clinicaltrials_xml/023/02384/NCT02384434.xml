	<brief_summary>This single-arm phase I/II study establishes safety efficacy low level laser therapy ( LLLT ) order mitigate radiation-induced dermatitis patient underoing radiation therapy head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . Additional objective include assessment patient-reported quality life data , pain parameter dermatologic quality life response . The target population patient histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx larynx candidate either definitive adjuvant therapy consist chemotherapy regimen concurrent radiation therapy . Patients require favorable performance status ( KPS great equal 70 ) , prior head neck radiotherapy least 18 year age able provide consent . While receive radiotherapy concurrent systemic regimen , patient receive LLLT use 69 diode probe dual 660 nm 850 nm wavelength least nine treatment site head neck region duration 60 second site . LLLT give three time week prior , daily first week , least twice weekly thereafter radiotherapy . Information collect include toxicity score quality life survey . A retrospective matched-pair design use assess rate grade III complication compare patient treat previously without LLLT support , anticipate 20 % reduction risk grade III dermatitis .</brief_summary>
