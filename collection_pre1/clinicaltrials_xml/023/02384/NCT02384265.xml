	<detailed_description>Control Condition . Control group participant consist person diabetes ( PWD ) two support team member ( STMs ) . The PWD receive regular medical care usual provider . They also receive introductory educational session write material diabetes , importance control , diabetes self-care strategy , blood glucose physical activity monitoring log . They invite study visit , distinct routine clinic visit , 3 , 6 , 12 month measure cholesterol , A1c ( diabetes ) , blood pressure , height , weight measurement . Participants control condition receive generic health promotion information in-person visit mail . They receive follow-up message text remind study related event . Intervention Group . Participants intervention condition consist PWD two STMs . The PWD receive protocol `` Usual Care '' participant receive , include introductory educational session , write material diabetes , blood glucose log , physical activity monitoring log . The PWDs intervention group receive train action planning link role self-identity . Role identity keep highly salient throughout study use identity prime remind individual process ( diabetes self-care behavior ) goal ( achieve A1c target ) important responsibility associate role . For example , participant may ask keep picture memento reminds role identity ( e.g. , picture child photo place would like visit ) blood sugar physical activity log study provide patient . The STMs intervention group discuss role identity motivator PWD team intake session . They also obtain similar train action planning way support PWD order well control diabetes . Intervention team member remind PWD 's intrinsic motivation ( IM ) , engage regular diabetes self-care improve diabetes control , interaction design boost participant ' confidence accomplish sustain behavior change contribute interim long term goal . These interaction include text message support team study team member support team . The text message include individually- and/or culturally-tailored message , link motivating factor identify questionnaire probe . The text message take vary form : ( ) General diabetes message derive source ADA African American Programs National Diabetes Education Program ; ( b ) Reminders blood glucose monitoring , medication adherence , diet , exercise , behavior contribute maintain role identity ; ( c ) Prompts query home glucose monitor reading frequency allow participant communicate text study staff non-urgent matter ; ( ) Challenges contest receive supportive text message . Face-to-Face Meetings occur baseline month 3 , 6 , 12 gather study data . For intervention group , also include contact study team member help intervention PWD STMs identify agree desire behavior A1c target . The study team member review glucometer reading , medication refill , A1c level ; encourage PWD engage process ( e.g. , self-monitoring adhere medication ) ; encourage STMs supportive role ; congratulate PWDs near reach A1c target ; motivate difficulty reach target . Baseline Protocols Data Collection After randomization , participant ask provide verbal consent survey tailor study arm role PWD STM , administer 35-45 minute baseline in-person survey English phone . There four different version survey : Intervention PWD , Intervention STM , Control PWD , Control STM . Following administration baseline survey , intervention participant allow select message theme would like receive list option base factor identify intrinsic motivator interval would like receive text message ( range 5 per week 2 per day ) . The investigator plan send average three message per day , elicit average 1-2 response per day . Additionally , intervention PWDs tell target A1c goal incentive associate specific drop A1c . At stage , study staff discus PWDs STMs intervention group potential risk harm use inappropriate strategy try attain glycemic target , obtain monetary incentive . All enrol patient participate small group 30 minute session study staff clinic discus diabetes self-care . All participant also invite participate ongoing diabetes class activity , person give list diabetes resource available clinic ( e.g . group individual diabetes education ) calendar local event activity , ADA Project Power diabetes class local church , exercise class , healthy eat group . Follow-up Protocols Data Collection Once month 6 month intervention period , participant intervention group receive phone call study staff reinforce intrinsic motivation improve glycemic control . At month 3 , 6 , 12 , participant ( PWDs ) control intervention group receive reminder A1c test due ( via phone , mail , text message ) . At month 3 6 , intervention team also receive message ( via phone , mail , text ) deadline in-person incentive payment . In addition , intervention participant ( PWDs ) attain target A1c level receive appropriate monetary incentive base new A1c level participation lottery . Compensation incentives delivered time test . At 6 month visit , study subject group administer abbreviated version baseline survey . At point financial incentive withdrawn IM , reminder , generic text message stop intervention arm , , like control arm , receive reminder message clinic visit get A1c test ( A1c test complete PWDs control intervention group ) . At 12 month , PWD STM participant complete final survey . In event investigator unable reach study participant , investigator obtain alternate contact information study enrollment participant use locator form . This form store separate study participant ' data . This help increase retention course study , investigator update contact information regularly via text message . Once 12-month study visit complete , locator form destroy . Assess cost intervention In order determine feasibility import result study public community clinic cost analysis plan end study . Costs fall two main category : program cost cost health service use study participant . Program cost base actual cost incur study , include staff time supply , well opportunity cost time incurred participant attend quarterly study visit participate study phone call . Costs related personnel time measure product personnel time spend unit cost labor fringe benefit study staff . Personnel time spend study condition estimate self-report . Costs related use resource ( equipment supply , overhead ) measure product quantity use unit cost derive accounting data . The program developmental training cost measure , divide equally two intervention arm since identical protocol provider training require arm . Costs solely research purpose , data management analysis , exclude . The investigator derive health service cost survey data collect survey study participant . These data include information number outpatient medical visit , hospital stay , Emergency Department visit . Using data publish literature ( e.g . use Medicare data ) , investigator map cost onto unit utilization , cost one physician office visit one day hospital , thereby allow investigator estimate total cost incur health service .</detailed_description>
