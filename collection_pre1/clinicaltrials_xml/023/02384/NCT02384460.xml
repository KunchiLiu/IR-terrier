	<brief_title>ESSENCE Study : Efficacy Safety SD-101 Cream Patients With Epidermolysis Bullosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidermolysis Bullosa ( EB ) rare group inherit disorder typically manifest birth blister lesion formation skin , case , epithelial lining organ , response little apparent trauma . In consequence , skin extremely fragile result shear skin , cause high risk infection . All form EB debilitate life threaten . In EB subtypes , high mortality occur age 1 ( Junctional Herlitz ) , others adolescence early adulthood , typically due infection failure thrive . In addition , child survive 20 's 30 's also risk development virulent form squamous cell carcinoma , many case fatal . There standard care product available treat dermal manifestation EB , approve drug EB either Europe United States . There numerous study publish potential treatment skin manifestation associate EB , include vitamin E therapy , systemic phenytoin , topical nonsteroidal agent , cyproheptadine , tetracycline , dapsone . No controlled study show clinical benefit therapy . Newer exploratory treatment include skin graft , bioengineered skin product , gene therapy unsuccessful date . This Phase 3 , multi-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , study assess efficacy safety SD-101-6.0 cream vs. placebo ( SD-101-0.0 ) lesions patient Simplex , Recessive Dystrophic , Junctional non-Herlitz Epidermolysis Bullosa . SD-101-6.0 cream placebo ( SD-101-0.0 ) apply topically , day entire body period 90 day . Patients 1 target wound select baseline investigator . Selected target wound must least certain age . Photographic confirmation target wound location collect baseline , picture save first visit use confirm location target wound subsequent visit . The patient return study site Visit 2 ( 14 day ±5 day baseline ) , Visit 3 ( 30 day ±7 day baseline ) , Visit 4 ( 60 day ±7 day baseline ) , Visit 5 ( 90 day ±7 day baseline ) target wound , previously identify baseline , re-assessed level healing . In addition , itching , pain , body surface area ( BSA ) , target wound closure , scar heal target wound also assess visit . The ARANZ SilhouetteStar™ use measure target wound visit .</detailed_description>
