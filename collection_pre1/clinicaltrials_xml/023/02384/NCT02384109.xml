	<brief_title>A Pharmacist-Coordinated Implementation Diabetes Prevention Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The staggering number Americans prediabetes , 1 3 adult , ( 1 , 2 ) reinforces urgency implement effective action prevent incident diabetes . Several randomize control trial ( RCTs ) include Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) demonstrate intensive lifestyle change metformin significantly reduce risk progression diabetes compare placebo . ( 3-5 ) Prior effort disseminate treatment lifestyle practice result variable uptake limited population reach , ( 6 ) minimal virtually uptake metformin treatment prediabetes . Within University California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) Health System , investigator develop program embeds pharmacists ambulatory clinic co-manage patient primary care physician . The program , call Managing Medications Education Daily Support ( MyMEDS ) , enrol treat almost 250 patient diabetes poorly-controlled cardiovascular risk factor 14 primary care clinic last 12-months . Because effectiveness , leadership UCLA Health disseminate program 28 primary care clinic system , cover program-related cost include pharmacist ' salary appointment schedule . The MyMEDS program part routine clinical operation represent promise resource could mobilize improve care patient prediabetes . The investigator propose implement novel pragmatic diabetes prevention intervention leverage extend exist MyMEDS infrastructure . Within 14 28 randomly select intervention clinic , investigator facilitate appointment patient prediabetes MyMEDS pharmacist . The pharmacist educate patient DPP engage share decision-making diabetes prevention , use decision aid develop HealthWiseÂ© . They jointly develop plan care include intensive lifestyle change ( preferred strategy since great probability reduce incident diabetes mellitus ( DM ) ) and/or metformin , take immediate action pharmacist communicate decision primary care physician via electronic health record ( EHR ) . For participant select lifestyle change , investigator partner YMCA ( Young Men 's Christian Association ) Metropolitan Los Angeles , offer DPP multiple location sliding-scale rate . The YMCA track attendance participation 16 weekly lifestyle change session report data pharmacist study team ( see Appendix 1 letter support ) . For patient also select metformin , pharmacist prescribe medication permit California law SB 493 . ( 7 ) Pharmacists see patient prediabetes routine follow-up reinforce care plan . This pragmatic trial , research fund use support delivery intervention . Rather measure impact lifestyle and/or metformin incident diabetes clinical parameter , primary endpoint measure improvement active engagement treatment prediabetes . The Specific Aims follow : 1 . In practice level , cluster-randomized , intention-to-treat trial , test effectiveness use pharmacist implement diabetes prevention strategy among patient prediabetes , compare patient receive usual care , several outcome pre-planned stratification a-e age ( &lt; 60 v &gt; 60 year ) : 1 . Uptake intensive lifestyle change and/or metformin 4 month ( primary outcome ) 2 . Proportion patient achieve &gt; 5 % weight loss 4 12 month 3 . Adjusted mean weight loss 4 12 month , percentage body weight baseline 4 . Adjusted change A1c 12 month 5 . Adjusted change systolic blood pressure 12 month 2 . To evaluate characteristic influence long-term sustainability intervention , among intervention arm investigator measure : 1 . Acceptability patient , physician , pharmacist , clinic staff , community partner include YMCA 2 . Patient-reported psychosocial impact prediabetes , positive negative , stratified treatment select 3 . Uptake intensive lifestyle change and/or metformin 4 month , age ( &lt; 60 vs. 60+ ) , gender , race/ethnicity 4 . The incremental cost program implementation per participant successfully initiate lifestyle change and/or metformin . I</detailed_description>
