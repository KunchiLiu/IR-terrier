	<brief_title>Treatment Fecal Incontinence Using Allogenic-Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells : A Prospective , Dose Escalation , Randomized , Placebo-controlled , Parallel-group , Single-blind , Single-center Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Background : Fecal incontinence distress condition recurrent uncontrolled passage fecal material . Although fecal incontinence develop multifactorial cause , treatment limit medical surgical method . According recent study stem cell regeneration , report human adipose-derived stem cell plentiful capacity muscle regeneration , efficacy treat Crohn 's fistula . Therefore , investigator hypothesize capability muscle regeneration allogenic-adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( ALLO-ASC ) use treat degenerate anal sphincter , lead fecal incontinence . - Purpose : The investigator aim investigate safety efficacy treatment fecal incontinence injection ALLO-ASC anal sphincter . - Method 1 . Safety test allogenic ASCs injection In first year , investigator investigate safety ALLO-ASC injection dose escalation study . Patients sequentially enrol three group , compose three patient . They treat injection ALLO-ASC anal sphincter 3x107 cells/ml ( group 1 ) , 6x107 cells/ml ( group 2 ) , 9x107 cells/ml ( group 3 ) , respectively . After receive ALLO-ASC injection , patient receive physical examination , serologic immunologic response test ( CD4/CD8 ) assessment Wexner score , patient satisfaction survey , WHO toxicity scale , adverse event , anorectal manometry endorectal ultrasound 1 , 4 , 8 week , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 month outpatient clinic . The response ALLO-ASC injection assess 8 week injection effective dose determine among group . 2 . Efficacy test allogenic ASCs injection In second year , investigator assess efficacy ALLO-ASC injection compare ALLO-ASC injection group placebo group ( 0.9 % normal saline injection ) randomize , open-label , single-blind design . Each group compose six patient . Both clinical assessment follow-up period identical first-year protocol .</detailed_description>
