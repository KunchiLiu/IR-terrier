	<detailed_description>The prevalence cost associate Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) project increase exponentially owe unprecedented expansion elderly segment United States ' population . Given loom specter , delay onset AD symptom curb progression underlie disease process become national public health imperative ( U.S. DHHS 2014 ) . Delaying symptom onset little 5 year could reduce prevalence AD half ( U.S. DHHS 2014 , Khachaturian 2009 ) . Unfortunately , currently available drug treatment AD curative . Similarly , clinical trial test novel disease-modifying therapeutic disappointing ( Sperling 2011 ) . The urgency alternative approach halt global crisis pose AD overstate . Animal study demonstrate aerobic exercise ( EXER ) low-cost , low-risk intervention capable alter AD pathological process ( Adlard 2005 , Wu 2008 ) . Randomized controlled trial ( RCTs ) EXER old adult also reveal beneficial effect AD-relevant measure brain glucose metabolism memory/executive function ( Erickson 2011 , Baker 2009 ) . Importantly , recent evidence review find 7 key modifiable risk factor AD , physical activity high impact reduce national prevalence AD ( Barnes 2011 ) . However , presently RCTs examine effect EXER middle-aged , asymptomatic individual increase risk AD . This important knowledge gap several reason . Interventions halt AD pathological cascade likely effective implement prior pervasive neuronal damage ( Sperling 2011 ) . Secondly , person specific risk factor develop AD ( parental family history ( FH ) ) represent choice target population credible attempt reduce grow burden AD ( Jarvik 2008 ) . Lastly , key limitation prior EXER RCTs failure adequately account participant ' physical activity level outside intervention . Accordingly , main objective study pilot 26-week trial EXER among asymptomatic , middle-aged adult without family history ( FH ) AD enrol Wisconsin Registry Alzheimer 's Prevention ( WRAP ) Wisconsin Alzheimer 's Disease Research Center ( WADRC ) . The investigator ' near-term goal ass feasibility acceptability structure intervention preliminarily evaluate ( ) effect AD-relevant outcome glucose metabolism ( ii ) mechanism effect . The investigator ' longer-term goal use data gather via pilot refine intervention , estimate effect size key outcome , seek NIH funding longer definitive assessment whether EXER effectively curtail AD progression midlife . The specific aim : AIM 1 : Determine feasibility acceptability 26-week , 3-4 day per week , structure EXER regimen among middle-aged adult FH AD . Hypothesis : The investigator successfully enroll 30 participant ( 15 EXER usual physical activity group ) target study . At least 90 % participant within EXER group , call enhanced physical activity group , complete â‰¥80 % schedule training session . AIM 2 : Preliminarily characterize effect EXER intervention AD-related brain alteration . Hypothesis : Compared participant randomize usual physical activity group , randomize enhanced physical activity group demonstrate preserve brain glucose metabolism . Similar effect see secondary outcome include cerebral blood flow , hippocampal volume , vascular health , memory/executive function , mood . AIM 3 : Preliminarily evaluate ( ) biological mechanism EXER affect brain health cognition , ( ii ) individual difference factor potentially moderate EXER 's effect . Hypotheses : ( ) Persons enhance physical activity group exhibit significant increase circulate neurotrophins improve cardiorespiratory fitness , ( ii ) beneficial effect EXER pronounce participant decrease sedentary behavior outside intervention ( measure via accelerometry ) . AIM 4 : Preliminarily determine whether EXER improve vascular health . Hypothesis : Individuals enhance physical activity group exhibit comparatively increase cerebral blood flow , improve endothelial function .</detailed_description>
