	<brief_title>Filanesib ( ARRY-520 ) Combination With Pomalidomide Dexamethasone Relapsed/Refractory ( R/R ) Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>National , multicenter , open label single-arm , non-comparative study , evaluate MTD efficacy Kinesin Spindle Protein ( KSP ) inhibitor Filanesib ( ARRY-520 ) combination pomalidomide + dexamethasone relapse refractory MM patient . For purpose , relapse refractory MM patient least two prior line therapy include bortezomib lenalidomide , refractory intolerant lenalidomide refractory last line therapy treat 28-day cycle Filanesib administer iv 1-hour ( ± 10-minute ) infusion escalate dos day 1 , 2 , 15 &amp; 16 , + pomalidomide administer po escalating dose 21 day 7 day rest period + dexamethasone fix dose 40 mg po day 1 , 8 , 15 &amp; 22 . G-CSF prophylaxis mandatory patient Filanesib , start Day 3 Day 17 ( total 7 day ) . Treatment continue progression unacceptable toxicity . Initially , Phase I conduct use modified 3+3 dose-escalating algorithm . The first three patient enrol first dose level ( see Figure 1 dose escalation level ) . If DLT occur among , next cohort three patient continue next high dose level . If DLT occur among first three evaluable patient first cycle , three patient enrol dose level . If one DLT observe among six evaluable patient expand dose group cycle 1 , enrollment continue next high dose level follow scheme . If one DLT occur among three six evaluable patient include 1st cohort , alternative dose escalation start , reduction dose pomalidomide ( see Figure 1 ) . Patients treat follow 3+3 algorithm . If one DLT three six patient occur first dose level alternative escalation , study stop . MTD consider dose level ≤1 DLT observe among 6 evaluable patient , therefore , least six patient must treat give dose dose consider MTD . Once MTD determine Phase I , additional patient treat dose Phase II portion trial order define activity define toxicity combination MTD . Patient participation study comprise several period : The pre-treatment period include screen visit . After provide write Informed Consent form participate study , patient evaluate eligibility screening period 21 day ( Days -21 -1 ) . During treatment period , patient receive Filanesib combination pomalidomide dexamethasone 28-days-cycles progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive combination evaluate efficacy toxicity completion cycle . No intra-patient escalation perform , , patient include give dose level Phase I remain dose level treatment unless dose reduction require toxicity . All patient discontinue treatment cause different disease progression evaluate follow-up period every two month 1 additional year , disease status , survival safety ( include second primary malignancy ) . All patient progressed end treatment follow survival safety ( include second primary malignancy ) , phone contact acceptable . Patients consider on-study signature Informed Consent end follow-up period . Patients consider on-treatment duration treatment first 30 day follow treatment discontinuation . Treatment discontinuation define day last study drug dose administration . Patients receive study combination consider best interest . Specifically , treatment continue one follow event occur : - Disease progression . - Unacceptable toxicity . - Patient refusal . - Intercurrent serious illness . - Protocol deviation effect risk/benefit ratio clinical trial . - Treatment delay &gt; 4 week ( except case clear clinical benefit , sponsor ' approval ) . - Study closure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥18 year . Performance status ( ECOG ) ≤ 2 . Patient , Investigator 's opinion , willing able comply protocol requirement . Patient give voluntary write Informed Consent performance studyrelated procedure part normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw patient time without prejudice future medical care . Patients previously diagnose MM accord IMWG Criteria ( Blood 2011 ) previous treatment least 2 regimen require therapy due relapse/progression disease . Regarding disease history , patient must : Have receive 2 prior line therapy include bortezomib lenalidomide . Be refractory intolerant lenalidomide . Be refractory last line therapy . Refractoriness therapy define either failure achieve minimal response , development progressive disease ( PD ) therapy within 60 day finish . At least two cycle treatment must receive , unless PD document earlier . Only Phase II , patient must measurable disease , define follow : Serum monoclonal protein value ≥ 500 mg/dl . Urine light chain excretion ≥ 200 mg/24 hour . Abnormal serum free light chain ( FLCs ) ratio plus involved FLC level ≥ 10 mg/dl . Prior therapy Filanesib pomalidomide . Nonadequate hematological biochemical parameter specify : Hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dl . Platelets count &lt; 75 x109/L without previous platelet transfusion last 7 day . If high bone marrow infiltration ( &gt; 50 % ) present , ≥ 50 x109/L platelet count require . Neutrophils ( ANC ) &lt; 1.5 × 109/L without growth factor support ( defined growth factor administration least 14 day prior observation ) . If bone marrow contain ≥ 50 % plasma cell , neutrophil count ≥1.0 × 109/L allow . Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) : &gt; 2.5 x upper limit range . Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) : &gt; 2.5 x upper limit range . Total bilirubin : &gt; 2 x upper limit range . Creatinine clearance : &lt; 45 mL/min ( measure calculate Cockcroft Gault formula ) . Absence recovery significant nonhematological toxicity derive previous treatment . The presence alopecia NCICTC grade &lt; 2 symptomatic peripheral neuropathy allow . Concomitant antimyeloma therapy , include corticosteroid dose great 10 mg/d prednisone equivalent , within 14 day prior Day 1 Cycle 1 . Pregnant lactating woman ; men woman reproductive potential use highly effective contraceptive method . Previous history malignancy last five year ( except basal cell carcinoma , skin epithelioma carcinoma situ site ) . Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation six prior month active GVHD past month prior cycle 1 , day 1 . Other relevant disease adverse clinical condition : Congestive heart failure unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within 12 month inclusion study . Uncontrolled arterial hypertension unstable cardiac arrhythmia ( i.e . require change medication within last 3 month hospital admission within past 6 month ) . History significant neurological psychiatric disorder . Active infection . Significant nonneoplastic liver disease ( e.g. , cirrhosis , active chronic hepatitis ) .
