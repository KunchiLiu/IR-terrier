	<brief_title>Incidence Prognostic Factors Associated With Heart Failure Following Myocardial Infarction : CALIBER Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) major medical problem western world . Heart failure associate substantial morbidity mortality contribute significant extent economic loss healthcare system . An increased prevalence HF expect survival increase ischaemic event due primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) due demographic change ( age population ) . At moment , contemporary data large scale electronic health record cohort report regard incidence HF follow myocardial infarction ( MI ) . The aim research investigate incidence HF follow MI across different time period search predictor HF follow MI identify high-risk patient . Using CALIBER ( Cardiovascular disease research use link bespoke study electronic record ) data , patient HF follow MI identify incidence HF MI describe . Prognostic factor associate occurrence HF patient experience MI study . This important future observational research , clinical trial , measure health outcome guideline development . The study two aim . First describe 'real-world ' incidence HF follow MI . Differences clinically relevant group ( e.g . men woman , patient without - ST-elevation MI , ) examine . Second , identify prognostic factor develop HF patient MI . The following panel prognostic factor investigate : sociodemographic ; anthropomorphic haemodynamic ; behavioural ; co-existing condition ( cardiovascular non-cardiovascular ) ; blood biomarkers ; prescribe secondary preventive medication . This study part CALIBER ( Cardiovascular disease research use link bespoke study electronic record ) programme fund 5 year NIHR Wellcome Trust . The central theme CALIBER research linkage Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project ( MINAP ) primary care ( CPRD ) resource . The overarch aim CALIBER good understand aetiology prognosis specific coronary phenotype across range causal domain , particularly electronic record provide contribution beyond traditional study . CALIBER receive Ethics approval ( ref 09/H0810/16 ) ECC approval ( ref ECC 2-06 ( b ) /2009 CALIBER dataset ) .</detailed_description>
