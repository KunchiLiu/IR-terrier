Ultrasonography elastography diagnostic imaging test use sound wave make picture body without use radiation ( x-rays ) . Real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasonography shear wave elastography may help measure patient 's response treatment give surgery patient soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Real-Time Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasonography Shear Wave Elastography Predicting Treatment Response Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate whether two different radiologist reliably interpret follow quantitative criterion regard maximally enhance portion soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) , sequential contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS ) exam perform , , neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) : change peak enhancement ( decibel ) , change slope enhancement curve , change area curve . II . To evaluate CEUS potential early response assessment biomarker compare CEUS rating result compute tomography ( CT ) /magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) rating result . ( Exploratory ) III . To examine agreement CEUS versus CT/MRI determine treatment response within radiologist rater . ( Exploratory ) IV . To examine agreement CEUS versus CT/MRI determine treatment response base consensus rating result two radiologist raters . ( Exploratory ) V. To explore potential quantitative biomarker possible parameter extract CEUS data assess early treatment response neoadjuvant therapy ( NAT ) sarcoma use receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve predict radiologist rat binary outcome : responder versus non-responders . ( Exploratory ) VI . To collect preliminary data shear wave elastography ( SWE ) patient population . ( Exploratory ) OUTLINE : Patients undergo real-time CEUS SWE baseline , 6 week initiation neoadjuvant therapy , 9 week initiation neoadjuvant therapy ( prior surgery ) . After completion study , patient follow 24 hour .</detailed_description>
