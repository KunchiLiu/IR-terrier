Patient significant abnormal hepatic and/or renal function . 11 . Patient 's tumor measurable ; 0.2 - 10 cm size number 1 - 15 . All measurable tumor spread bone , liver , lung , kidney , abdomen include data analysis . Patients follow condition exclude study : 1 . Hemoglobulin le 9 g/dL WBC le 4.0 k/µL . 2 . Platelet count less 100,000/µL . 3 . INR great 1.5 4 . Patient currently take therapeutic dos warfarin anti anti-platelet agent . 5 . Patient history abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , peptic ulcer disease , intra-abdominal abscess within 6 month prior study enrollment . 6 . Patient currently uncontrolled hypertension , diabetes , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia . 7 . Patient major surgery perform within 4 week prior enter study ; patient recover adverse event due surgery perform 4 week earlier . 8 . Patient history allergic reaction Bromelain pineapple-containing product . 9 . Female patient pregnant breastfeeding . 10 . Patient tumor widely spread chest abdomen measure CT scan . Patients eligible study randomly assign either low dose group high dose group coin toss . Each study subject assign patient number purpose study . 2 . Drug Dosage Schedule High Dose Group-The oral dose Bromelain ( 50 mg/kg/day ) extrapolate vivo animal study , determine safe Safety study healthy human subject ( see Section VII-A ) . For clinical investigation , High Dose group give Bromelain 50 mg/kg/day , maximum 2400 mg/day ( divide 2 doses/day 1200 mg/dose ) Low Dose Group - Low Dose group give 10 mg/kg/day , maximum 500 mg/day ( divide 2 doses/day 250 mg/dose ) . The number patient suffer well-documented malignancy assign group least 30 : combination mixed type carcinoma breast , lung , colon , gastro-intestinal , ovarian , cervical , uterine , prostatic , hepatic , bladder , lymphoma , melanoma , forth . These patient give Bromelain 500 mg/day , divide two dos 250 mg/dose take meal . High Dose Group - The dose 50 mg/kg/day , The number patient suffer well-documented malignancy least 60 : combination mixed type carcinoma breast , lung , colon , gastro-intestinal , ovarian , cervical , uterine , prostatic , hepatic , bladder , lymphoma , melanoma , forth . These patient give Bromelain 2400 mg/day , divide two dos 1200 mg/dose take meal . 3 . Duration Route Administration Study subject provide Bromelain oral administration . The container clearly label ( see Section V-E ) . Bromelain take orally twice daily meal . On biweekly visit Doctor 's Office , Study patient provide enough dos two week . The study patient require keep journal daily dos take side effect experience . The study patient evaluate use blood test CT scan six month sign disease progression . If disease progress , treatment continue patient evaluate every six month thereafter investigator determines otherwise . If disease progress , patient take study .</detailed_description>
