	<brief_title>A Pilot RCT PRISM Intervention AYAs With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experience serious illness among adolescent young adult ( AYAs ) unique face distinctive developmental challenge , transition , choice related education , employment , identity , relationship family . Age-specific intervention need promote positive resource outcomes . Resilience , example , construct describe individual 's capacity maintain psychological and/or physical well-being face stress , good candidate buffer negative effect stress . While study describe positive outcome AYA patient chronic disease , few still suggest mechanisms promote resilience , evidence suggest promote `` resilience-resources '' ( e.g. , stress-management goal set skill , meaning-making positive-reframing negative experience ) , mean manage stress may valuable . We previously describe model factor resilience among AYAs cancer well parent child cancer , demonstrate self-perceptions resilience strongly associate outcome . Through iterative pilot testing , successfully develop novel , patient-centered resilience-based intervention , `` Promoting Resilience Stress Management '' ( PRISM ) intervention . The overall goal PRISM intervention improve AYA self-perceived resilience , thereby reduce AYA distress , improve quality life , minimize risky health behavior . The brief format involve 4 , 50-minute , one-on-one session approximately 2 week apart , plus 5th , optional , family-inclusive session 2-4 week follow session # 4 . These compliment age-specific handout describe skill opportunity practice , well monthly `` booster '' session . Specifically , intervention incorporates four primary skill : 1 ) stress management/mindfulness ; 2 ) goal-setting ; 3 ) cognitive restructuring ; , 4 ) meaning-making/benefit finding . Enrolled patient 13 25 years-old least 2 week history new recurrent malignancy . They randomize receive PRISM intervention standard psychosocial supportive care . Patients group invite complete quantitative survey time enrollment 2- , 4- , 6- , 12-months later . Participants compensate time . The primary outcome study self-perceived resilience , measure Connor-Davidson Resilience Score , 6-months post-enrollment . Secondary outcome assess resilience score 4 , 6 , 12 month , well self-efficacy , anxiety , depression , benefit-finding , quality life , goal-setting skill , health behavior 6 12 month . The study anticipate accrue total 100 patient 2 year .</detailed_description>
