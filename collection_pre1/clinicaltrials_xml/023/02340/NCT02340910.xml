	<brief_title>Dose-Response Effects Whole Body Vibration Spasticity Walking SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1 study successfully complete . The result Phase 1 indicate combination high-frequency ( 50Hz ) long duration 6 minute ( deliver eight 45-sec bout ) WBV associate large change spasticity ( measure pendulum test ) . It also seem feasible WBV would serve prim stimulus increase responsiveness training . The goal Phase 2 understand add WBV physical therapy/exercise training result decrease spasticity improve walking ability compare train alone . Two different dos WBV , short dose long dose test .</detailed_description>
