	<detailed_description>The world prevalence diabetes mellitus 2010 estimate 6.4 % adult population , increase 7.7 % expected 2030 . 90-95 % individual diabetes type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . The complication T2D lead substantially increase risk hypertension , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) development heart failure . CVD common cause death European adult diabetes , risk develop CVD double observe individual without diabetes . Lowering HbA1c type 2 diabetes decrease absolute risk develop CVD 5-17 % , well decrease all-cause mortality 6-15 % . Individuals T2D recommend exercise moderately vigorously least 150 minute per week . However , majority adult fail meet guideline even minimum amount physical activity , lack time often cite main reason . This research group previously show 4x4 minute high intensity aerobic interval training ( AIT ) yield significantly great response HbA1c , BMI diastolic dysfunction patient T2D duration &lt; 10years contrast present recommendation . AIT reduce cardiovascular risk factor moderate continuous training patient heart failure metabolic syndrome . In metabolic syndrome , AIT superior enhance endothelial function , insulin signal fat skeletal muscle reduce blood glucose . This show AIT time-efficient highly effective form exercise patient T2D patient group . Recently , even low training volume make use project present , show indication improve glycaemic control T2D . Only two week total six session high intensity training reduces blood glucose significantly individual T2D . Even short interval all-out activity ( 2-7 bout 20-30 second supramaximal ergometer cycle ) show improve aerobic capacity number metabolic cardiovascular risk factor week train . However , low-volume high-intensity exercise study limit T2D . The present study aim compare effect two time save , high intensity exercise protocols cardiovascular risk factor patient type 2 diabetes . The investigator assume glycemic control improve low-volume high intensity interval training extremely low-volume sprint interval training .</detailed_description>
