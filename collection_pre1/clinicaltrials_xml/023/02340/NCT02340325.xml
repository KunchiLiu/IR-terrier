	<brief_summary>Background Scarring typically occur trauma , burn injury surgery . Hypertrophic scar present raise , red itchy lesion variably respond various treatment modality , corticosteroid , pressure garment , laser therapy , use silicone sheet radiotherapy . Kynurenine , `` Fibrostop 1 '' ( FS1 ) , breakdown product , kynurenic acid , `` Fibrostop 2 '' ( FS2 ) , endogenous product find many system show potential reducing scar formation animal study . The aim study evaluate safety tolerability FS2 cream apply skin healthy human subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Scarring typically occur trauma , burn injury surgery . Hypertrophic scar ( scar excessive amount protein call collagen ) keloid ( hypertrophic scar grow beyond boundary original wound ) type abnormal scarring term `` dermal fibroproliferative disorder '' - disorder abnormal growth fibrous tissue dermis , layer normal skin . These disorder present raise , red itchy lesion variably respond various treatment modality , corticosteroid , pressure garment , laser therapy , use silicone sheet radiotherapy . Surgical excision hypertrophic scar keloid often lead recurrence result cosmetic deformity contracture . In previous study involve hypertrophic scar rabbit model , find collagen deposition could reduce increase activity molecule call MMP-1 ( matrix metalloproteinase 1 ) , enzyme inside body cell . The investigator also know investigator previous work molecule call kynurenine , breakdown product amino-acids , reduce collagen deposition possibly stimulate MMP production . Kynurenine breakdown product ( catabolite ) essential amino acid tryptophan use production niacin - organic compound essential human nutrient find food . Kynurenine make enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( IDO ) find many tissue response activation immune systen , also enzyme tryptophan dioxygenase , find liver . Kynurenine convert kynurenic acid , `` Fibrostop 2 '' ( FS2 ) , carry many function body , include dilate blood vessel inflammation regulate immune response . The investigator hypothesize improved healing outcome investigator rabbit model due kynurenine by-product stimulate MMP , turn act cell ( fibroblast ) reduce collagen production . This hypothesis lead study investigate effect topical 0.5 % kynurenine cream treatment MMP-1 MMP-3 expression fibrotic rabbit ear wound model . The result show marked improvement scar formation suggest possible use kynurenine anti-fibrogenic treatment scar . Toxicity , pharmacodynamic , pharmacokinetic data complete , investigator institution prepare conduct first Phase I clinical trial . The investigator objective evaluate safety tolerability topically apply FS2 healthy human subject conduct double-blinded acute chronic sensitivity study involve patch testing .</detailed_description>
