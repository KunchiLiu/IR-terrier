	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Low-Dose Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) Added Extra-Corporeal Photopheresis Steroid-Refractory Chronic Graft-versus-Host-Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve IL-2 treatment chronic GVHD approve metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( MCC ) metastatic melanoma . ECP standard care treatment chronic GVHD respond steroid . Chronic GVHD medical condition may occur receive bone marrow , stem cell cord blood transplant donor . The donor 's immune system may recognize ( host ) foreign attempt 'reject ' . This process know graft-versus-host disease . Traditional standard therapy treat chronic GVHD prednisone ( steroid ) . Participants trial respond steroid therapy . The investigstors look ass whether combination IL-2 ECP therapy help control chronic GVHD stop donor 's immune system 'rejecting ' participant 's body . Participants receive standard-of-care ECP treatment two time week 16 week . Each treatment last approximately 2-3 hour . Starting Week 8 ECP treatment , participant give give IL-2 injection skin . Participants every day 8 week end 16-week ECP treatment . If participant 's GVHD worsen initial 8 week ECP treatment , option start IL-2 early . If participant 's chronic GVHD improve end 16-week study duration , may option continue combination therapy ECP IL-2 . Extended duration therapy twice weekly ECP treatment plus daily IL-2 start end week 16 . Participants may also option continue ECP treatment without IL-2 end Week 16 . If case , participant follow one year start therapy require study visit test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Recipients 78/8 HLA match adult donor allogeneic stem cell transplantation myeloablative nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen . Participants must steroidrefractory cGVHD . Steroidrefractory cGVHD define persistent sign symptom cGVHD ( Appendix D ; section 17.4 ) despite use prednisone ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day ( 0.5 mg/kg every day ) least 4 week ( equivalent dose alternate corticosteroid ) without complete resolution sign symptom . Patients either extensive chronic GVHD limit chronic GVHD require systemic therapy eligible . Stable dose corticosteroid 4 week prior enrollment No addition subtraction immunosuppressive medication ( e.g. , calcineurininhibitors , sirolimus , mycophenolatemofetil ) 4 week prior enrollment . The dose immunosuppressive medicine may adjust base therapeutic range drug Patient age ≥18 year old . Because dose adverse event data currently available use IL2 participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . Estimated life expectancy great 3 month . ECOG performance status 02 ( Appendix A ; section 17.1 ) . Participants must adequate organ function define : Hepatic : Adequate hepatic function ( total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dlexception permit patient Gilbert 's Syndrome ; AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2x ULN ) , unless hepatic dysfunction manifestation presume cGVHD . For patient abnormal LFTs sole manifestation cGVHD , document GVHD liver biopsy require prior enrollment . Abnormal LFTs context active cGVHD involve organ system may also permit treat physician document abnormal LFTs consistent hepatic cGVHD , liver biopsy mandate situation . Renal : Serum creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . Pulmonary : FEV1 ≥ 50 % DLCO ( Hb ) ≥ 40 % predict , unless pulmonary dysfunction deem due chronic GVHD . Adequate bone marrow function indicate ANC &gt; 1000/mm3 platelet &gt; 50,000/mm3 without growth factor transfusion Cardiac : No myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment NYHA Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , ECG abnormality screen must document investigator medically relevant . The effect IL2 develop human fetus unknown . For reason chemotherapeutic agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Ongoing prednisone requirement &gt; 1 mg/kg/day ( equivalent ) . Concurrent use calcineurininhibitors plus sirolimus . Either agent alone acceptable . History thrombotic microangiopathy , hemolyticuremic syndrome thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura . Exposure new immunosuppressive medication 4 week prior enrollment . Extracorporeal Photopheresis ( ECP ) rituximab therapy within 4 week prior enrollment Any contraindication ECP , i.e . contraindication heparin 8MOP . Posttransplant exposure novel immunosuppressive medication ( e.g. , alemtuzumab ) within 100 day prior enrollment . Donor lymphocyte infusion within 100 day prior enrollment . Active malignant relapse . Active uncontrolled infection . Inability comply IL2 treatment regimen . Uncontrolled cardiac angina symptomatic congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class III IV : Appendix C ; section 17.3 ) . Organ transplant ( allograft ) recipient . HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction agent use allogeneic HSCT . In addition , individual increase risk lethal infection . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Individuals active hepatitis B C ineligible high risk lethal treatmentrelated hepatotoxicity HSCT . Other investigational drug within 4 week prior enrollment , unless clear Principal Investigator . Pregnant woman exclude study potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother , breastfeed discontinue .</criteria>
