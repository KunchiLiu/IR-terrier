	<brief_title>Endocuff-assisted vs. Standard Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tandem colonoscopy study result , show novel endoscopic technology detect 20 % adenomas conventional colonoscopy ( missed adenoma ) . Since Endocuff-assisted colonoscopy consider perfect examination , hypothesize conventional colonoscopy detect one third miss adenomas Endocuff-assisted colonoscopy detects similar setting . Therefore sample size 120 adenoma achieves 80 % power detect odds ratio 3.0 use two-sided McNemar test significance level 0.05 . The odds ratio equivalent difference two pair proportion 14 % occur proportion detect missed adenomas Endocuff-assisted colonoscopy 21 % proportion miss adenomas conventional colonoscopy 7 % . During one year period study initiation , colonoscopy performance quality data show detect mean number adenoma per patient equal 0.7 population similar one recruit study . Therefore , 172 patient overall require detect 120 adenoma . Given uncertainty estimation order cope patient exclusion , withdrawal unexpected incomplete colonoscopy , decide recruit 200 patient . A extensive description regard investigator study provide follow field .</detailed_description>
