	<brief_title>Breast Tumor Oxygenation During Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While benefit exercise overall health widely document , little known exercise affect progression treatment malignant neoplasm . Tumors complex vascular network likely affect global change hemodynamics perfusion occur moderate exercise . Increased tumor oxygenation clinically relevant may counteract hypoxic tumor environment know contribute resistance chemo- radiation therapy , angiogenesis , invasiveness metastasis , genomic instability , resistance cell death . The researcher use noninvasive optical imaging technology call diffuse optical spectroscopy safely non-invasively quantify dynamic blood flow metabolism tumor normal tissue subject undergo supervise cycling exercise . The researcher determine exercise measurably increase tumor oxygenation , effect proportional intensity and/or duration exercise perform .</detailed_description>
