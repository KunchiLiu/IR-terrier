	<detailed_description>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) frequent subtype non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) , comprise approximately 30 % new case . Treatment result DLBCL significantly improve introduction rituximab ( R ) CHOP-like , anthracycline-based , treatment schedule , standard care . Nevertheless , even current R-CHOP-like treatment , approximately 30-40 % patient ultimately relapse progress . To date , high-dose therapy ( HDT ) follow autologous stem-cell transplantation ( ASCT ) reference treatment patient relapse primary refractory aggressive B-cell NHL , provide disease sensitive second-line chemotherapy . Among patient chemosensitive disease , remission status transplant significant impact outcome , patient complete remission ( CR ) HDT achieve good long-term progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient undergo transplantation partial remission ( PR ) . Standard salvage chemotherapy aggressive lymphoma exist . Commonly use second-line regimen include dexamethasone , cytarabine , cisplatin ( DHAP ) , ESHAP ( etoposide , methylprednisone , cytarabine , cisplatin ) , mini-BEAM ( carmustine , etoposide , cytarabine , melphalan ) ICE ( ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide ) . These regimen produce overall response rate ( ORR ) around 60 % , CR rate 25 % 35 % . More effective salvage regimen need order maximize number patient CR prior ASCT . Increasing evidence suggest rituximab add salvage chemotherapy improve response rate outcomes relapse DLBCL . In recent randomized phase 3 study , efficacy add rituximab DHAP-VIM-DHAP regimen test 239 rituximab-naïve patient relapse primary refractory aggressive cluster differentiation 20 ( CD20 ) + B-cell NHL . In 225 evaluable patient , addition rituximab second-line chemotherapy result significant improvement ORR ( 75 % versus 54 % , p=.01 ) PFS ( 52 % versus 31 % two year , p &lt; .002 ) . Other small phase II trial ( range 35-55 patient ) investigate rituximab combination ICE , DHAP EPOCH also show encouraging result . However , patient study previously expose rituximab , present , almost patient aggressive B-cell NHL receive rituximab combine first-line chemotherapy . In recent multicenter retrospective study , analyze influence prior exposure rituximab response rate outcomes 163 patient relapsed refractory DLBCL receive Rituximab-ESHAP ( R-ESHAP ) salvage therapy curative purpose . In study , prior exposure rituximab independent effect response rate R-ESHAP . However , high proportion ( 57.4 % ) patient receive prior rituximab treatment experience disease relapse progression , translate significantly bad PFS ( 17 v 57 % 3 year ) OS ( 38 % v 67 % 3 year ) compare rituximab-naïve patient . This observation independent prognostic factor impact upon outcome , disease status R-ESHAP , age-adjusted International Prognostic Index ( IPI ) response R-ESHAP . Results CORAL randomise trial compare R-ICE R-DHAP 396 patient relapsed refractory DLBCL confirm exposure rituximab prior salvage therapy associate bad outcome . Rituximab naïve patient 83 % response rate 47 % 3-year event-free survival ( EFS ) compare 51 % response rate 21 % EFS patient receive prior rituximab treatment . These result suggest use highly effective rituximab-containing primary therapy DLBCL make difficult salvage patient refractory relapse . Thus , prospective study incorporate new agent need patient . Lenalidomide : Lenalidomide , analog thalidomide , promise new therapeutic agent seem cause significant somnolence , constipation , neuropathy , usually dose-limiting thalidomide . It hypothesize mechanism action lenalidomide include immunomodulatory , antineoplastic , anti-angiogenic pro-erythropoietic property . Preclinical well clinical observation demonstrate lenalidomide downregulates production various critical prosurvival cytokine tumour microenvironment concurrently promote activation T- natural killer ( NK ) cell-mediated antitumour response . In aggressive lymphoma , lenalidomide show exert antiproliferative activity enhance expression cell cycle regulator , include p21 SPARC , induce G1 cell cycle arrest , caspase activation , apoptosis . In recent phase II multicenter trial , 49 patient relapsed refractory aggressive NHL ( diffuse large B-cell , follicular center grade 3 , mantle cell , transform lymphoma ) receive oral lenalidomide monotherapy , 25 mg daily day 1 21 , every 28 day , 52 week , disease progression intolerance . The common histology diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . The median age 65 year ( range : 23 86 ) . Patients receive median four prior treatment regimen ; 56 % refractory last therapy 29 % receive prior ASCT . An objective response rate 35 % observe 49 treated patient , include 12 % rate complete response/unconfirmed complete response . Responses observe aggressive histologic subtype test ( 19 % ORR patient DLBCL ) . Of patient stable disease partial response first assessment , 25 % improved continued treatment . Estimated median duration response 6.2 month , median PFS 4.0 month . The common grade 4 adverse event neutropenia ( 8.2 % ) thrombocytopenia ( 8.2 % ) ; common grade 3 adverse event neutropenia ( 24.5 % ) , leukopenia ( 14.3 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 12.2 % ) . The result study show lenalidomide monotherapy active relapse refractory aggressive NHL , manageable side effect . A confirmatory international phase II trial ( NHL-003 ) single-agent lenalidomide perform patient relapsed/refractory aggressive NHL receive least one prior treatment measurable disease . Patients receive 25 mg oral lenalidomide daily day 1-21 every 28-day cycle continue therapy disease progression toxicity . 217 patient enrol received lenalidomide . The ORR 35 % ( 77/217 ) , 13 % ( 29/217 ) CR , 22 % ( 48/217 ) PR , 21 % ( 45/217 ) stable disease . The ORR DLBCL 28 % ( 30/108 ) , 42 % ( 24/57 ) mantel-cell lymphoma , 42 % ( 8/19 ) grade 3 follicular lymphoma , 45 % ( 15/33 ) peripheral T-cell lymphoma . Median progression-free survival 217 patient 3.7 month [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 2.7-5.1 ] . For 77 responder , median response duration last 10.6 month ( 95 % CI 7.0-NR ) . Median response duration reach 29 patient achieve CR respond patient follicular lymphoma ( FL ) -III mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) . The common adverse event myelosuppression grade 4 neutropenia thrombocytopenia 17 % 6 % , respectively.The result international study confirm lenalidomide active heavily pre-treated patient relapse refractory DLBCL manageable side effect . The result phase II study demonstrate activity oral lenalidomide monotherapy patient relapse refractory aggressive NHL warrant investigation lenalidomide therapy , alone combination , treatment patient aggressive NHL . It recently report used combination , lenalidomide ( maximum-tolerated dose [ MTD ] 20 mg/day , 21 28 day ) rituximab produce robust response rate relapse refractory mantle cell lymphoma , favourable toxicity profile . In multiple myeloma ( MM ) patient , several phase 1/2 trial evaluate lenalidomide conjunction chemotherapy , melphalan prednisone ( MTD 10 mg/day , 21 day every 4 6 week ) , doxorubicin dexamethasone ( MTD 25 mg/day G-Colony-stimulating factor ( CSF ) , 21 28 day ) , doxorubicin , vincristine dexamethasone ( MTD 10 mg/day , 21 day every 4 6 week ) . These combination provide considerable proportion high-quality response substantial durability patient MM overcome several well-known adverse prognostic factor . A phase 1 study show lenalidomide safely combine R-CHOP ( R2CHOP ) initial chemotherapy aggressive B-cell lymphoma . Preliminary result ongoing phase 2 suggest addition lenalidomide rituximab , cyclophosphamide , adriamycin , vincristine prednisone ( RCHOP ) could overcome negative prognostic impact non-germinal center B-cell ( GCB ) phenotype outcome . Thus , propose open-label , non-randomized , multicentre , escalating-dose , Phase I trial , investigate safety maximum-tolerated dose combination R-ESHAP lenalidomide salvage therapy patient relapse refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma candidate stem-cell transplantation . We expect haematological toxicity main form toxicity , show previous study . We must also take account possible adverse influence lenalidomide treatment stem cell mobilization . In patient MM , prior lenalidomide therapy associate high rate failure stem cell mobilization filgrastim . Remobilization chemotherapy filgrastim usually successful patient . After selection maximum-tolerated dose combination R-ESHAP lenalidomide phase 2 study perform order evaluate ORR LR-ESHAP . Partial data verification perform . A Clinical Research Organization ( Dynamic Science S.L ) Standard Operating Procedures use manage clinical trial . Categorical variable show absolute relative frequency , include confidence interval 95 % . For description continuous variable use mean , standard deviation , median , mode , minimum maximum , include total number valid value . In case compare subgroup patient , use quantitative variable parametric test nonparametric characteristic variable study . For qualitative variable use Chi-square test .
