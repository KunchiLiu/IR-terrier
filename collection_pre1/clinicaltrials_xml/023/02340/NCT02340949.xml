	<brief_title>Induction FOLFOX With Without Aflibercept Followed Chemoradiation High Risk Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized trial compare induction treatment FOLFOX without aflibercept high risk population select MRI , prior receive standard chemoradiation ( capecitabine combine 50.4 Gy 28 day ) surgery . Once confirmed subject fulfill eligibility criterion ( MRI-defined high risk RC ) , sign informed consent , central review request confirm clinical stage , randomize receive mFOLFOX6 + Aflibercept mFOLFOX6 ( without Aflibercept ) . Random assignment treatment stratify T3 versus T4 stage . All patient enrol study receive one cycle study medication ( mFOLFOX6 without aflibercept ) every 14 day six cycle , unless unacceptable toxicity progression detect . After treatment , patient receive standard chemo-radiotherapy ( CT/RT ) ( capecitabine 825 mg/m2 twice daily combine total dose 50.4 Gy 28 day ) follow surgery , provide progressed . Patients progression disease treatment phase withdrawn study receive treatment accord investigator 's judgment . If patient withdraws consent refuse receive treatment , patient must follow 3 year randomization progression , evaluate disease-free survival . If patient withdraws consent refuse continue study , follow-up evaluation must discontinue .</detailed_description>
