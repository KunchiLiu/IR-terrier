	<detailed_description>Recurrent abdominal pain long acknowledge one common chronic pain entity child . In US , ~13-17 % school-aged child adolescent report abdominal pain occurs least weekly 21 % report pain severe enough interfere daily activity . ( 1 ) For child ( ~90 % ) , specific organic disease find . However , child experience decrease quality life comparable child identifiable organic disease inflammatory bowel disease gastro-esophageal reflux . ( 2 ) In addition , child identifiable organic disease appear get well often continue problem abdominal pain associate symptom adulthood . ( 3,4 ) Over 90 % child chronic abdominal pain fit diagnostic criterion functional gastrointestinal disorder ( FGID ) . ( 5 ) As define Rome criterion , FGIDs set diagnosis specific symptom profile absence structural biochemical abnormality explain symptom . FGIDs relate chronic recurrent abdominal pain include irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , functional dyspepsia ( FD ) , functional abdominal pain ( FAP ) , abdominal migraine . ( 6 ) FGIDs probably best understood utilizing biopsychosocial model state abdominal pain occur result vary contribution , interaction , biological factor , psychological factor , social factor . The biological factor implicate generation abdominal pain include motility disturbance , visceral hypersensitivity , inflammation . Stress/anxiety implicate psychologic factor . Anxiety may interact motility inflammation . For example , investigator demonstrate association anxiety mucosal mast cell child post-prandial distress syndrome , subcategory FD . ( 7 ) The scaffold interaction various factor term brain-gut axis consist neural humoral pathway . There increase evidence investigator need expand paradigm include interaction biopsychosocial model intestinal flora , i.e . brain-gut-microbiota axis ( B-G-M axis ) . It become increasingly clear host anxiety stress effect composition microbiome . ( 8 ) Likewise , microbiome influence neural development , brain chemistry , wide range behavioral phenomenon include emotional behavior , pain perception , stress system respond . ( 9 ) Both immune neural pathway involve intimately visceral pain perception intestinal microbiota modulate communication . ( 8 ) The general scaffold brain-gut-microbiota axis include CNS , neuroendocrine neuroimmune system , autonomic nervous system , enteric nervous system . ( 10 ) Microbiota communicate brain-gut axis different mechanism include direct interaction mucosal cell , via immune cell , via contact neural ending . ( 11 ) The B-G-M axis study primarily four condition : 1. germ free intestine , 2. infection bacterial introduction , 3. antibiotic exposure , 4. probiotic treatment . Germ free mouse exhibit anxiety-like behavior accompany decreased N-metyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit mRNA expression amygdala increase BDNF expression decrease serotonin receptor 1A expression dentate granule layer hippocampus . ( 12 ) The brain aware introduction pathogenic microbe GI tract result brain stem nuclei become activated instance , associate development anxiety-like behavior . ( 8 ) This occur within hour introduction pathogens subclinical threshold . ( 8 ) Even minute dos microbe trigger immune response capable influence neurotransmission paraventricular hypothalamus , central nucleus amygdale , bed nucleus stria terminalis , three region involve process emotion relate anxiety mood . ( 13 ) Citerobacter rodentium ( CR ) bacteria evaluate number study involve mouse . CR-infected mouse demonstrate anxious-like behavior 7-8 hour . ( 14 ) CR demonstrate induce anxiety-like behavior associate change plasma level IFN-γ , TNF-α , IL-12 evidence increase vagal transmission without mucosal inflammation . ( 15 ) Additional work also demonstrate Helicobacter pylorus infect mice exhibit anxiety-like behavior correct treatment probiotic , Bifidobacterium . Oral antibiotic also show induce anxiety-like behavior mouse . ( 8 ) This behavior change transient behavior normalize normal flora restore . This effect see systemic antibiotic administration . Changes behavior accompanied increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) hippocampus amygdala . ( 8 ) Lastly , clinical evidence mount support role probiotic reduce anxiety stress response well improve mood patient IBS chronic fatigue . ( 14 ) Probiotics show reduce anxiety rat beneficial psychological effect decrease serum cortisol human . ( 14 ) Lactobacillus reuteri show decrease anxiety stress-induced increase corticosterone mouse . ( A ) In addition , number study demonstrate effect probiotic anxiety human . ( 8,9,13 ) The DCX-domain family protein demonstrate involved signal transduction cytoskeletal regulation . The investigator demonstrate DCDC3a ( DCLK1/DCAMKL1 ) intestinal epithelial stem cell marker express intestinal mesenchymal stem cell niche play critical role intestinal tissue damage repair . DCDC2 alter mouse model Citrobacter rodentium infection TNBS induce colitis . DCDC2 knockout mice exhibit increase anxiety phenotype . ( 16 ) BDNF find promote neuronal survival differentiation guide axon extension vitro vivo . ( 17 ) Evidence suggest BDNF may act stress-responsive intercellular messenger modify HPA axis activity . ( 17 ) Short-term acute stress induces significant increase BDNF mRNA protein young old group change young group substantially great . ( 18 ) BDNF interaction inflammation pain . BDNF knock mouse show weaker visceral response colorectal distention . ( 19 ) A human study compare 40 adult IBS 21 healthy control . ( 20 ) Biopsies patient IBS reveal significant upregulation BDNF compare control . ( 20 ) The transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 ( TRPV1 ) express throughout gastrointestinal tract myenteric ganglion , muscular layer , mucosa TRPV1 expression report mast cell . ( 21 ) TRPV1 express intestinal sensory nerve activate capsaicin , heat , acid , inflammation . ( 21 ) TRPV1 receptor implicate mechanosensor involve integrate painful stimuli generation neurogenic inflammation hyperalgesia . ( 22 ) In rodent model inflammation , TPRV1 upregulated subsequent visceral hyperalgesia mechanical chemical stimulus attenuate TRPV1 antagonism . ( 22,23 ) In rat model , appear mast cell require upregulation TRPV1 infectious stress condition . ( 24 ) In human IBS , significant increase rectosigmoid TRPV1-immunoreactive fiber TRPV1 mast cell related abdominal pain score . ( 21 ) Likewise , IBS quiescent inflammatory bowel disease associate increase rectosigmoid colon TRPV1-immunoreactive fiber compare asymptomatic quiescent IBD healthy control fiber correlate abdominal pain score . ( 25 ) There evidence significant role TRPV1 visceral sensitivity TRPV1 appear interact inflammation general , mast cell particular , influenced intestinal infection stress . The major initiator body 's physiological stress response release corticotropin release hormone ( CRH ) . CRH , produce within hypothalamus ( well immune cell , include human lymphocyte mast cell ) , principal regulator basal stress-induced pituitary-adrenal axis , turn , activate glucocorticoid ( e.g . cortisol ) adrenal androgen secretion . Though result variable , majority study support enhance HPA axis responsiveness least subset adult IBS . ( 26-30 ) CRH receptor ( CRH-R ) widely express within gastrointestinal tract immune cell , CRH-R activation multiple effect may relevant etiology FGIDs . These effect include alteration autonomic balance , visceral sensitivity , motility disturbance , inflammation . The important mechanism CRH may generate pain interaction inflammatory cell , directly via epithelial cell enteric nerve . CRH mediate visceral hypersensitivity activate mucosal mast cell subsequent mediator sensitization afferent sensory enteric nerve . ( 31,32 ) Gastric mast cell show increased adult dyspepsia may contain pre-formed newly synthesize cytokine ( include IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , TNF-α , among others ) . ( 33-34 ) The investigator demonstrate delayed gastric empty increased gastric dysrhythmia children/adolescents FD elevate antral mast cell density . ( 35 ) The investigator also demonstrate dysrhythmia associate increase post-prandial pain . ( 36 ) Adult human demonstrate selective luminal release tryptase histamine jejunal mast cell cold stress ; magnitude release show similar induced antigen exposure food allergic patient . ( 37 ) This rapid response peak histamine tryptase concentration occur 15 30 minute . Mast cell may also recruit eosinophil secondary effector cell . Eosinophils increase duodenal mucosa 71 % child FD also find increase adult FD . ( 38,39 ) These eosinophil highly activate investigator demonstrate clinical improvement treatment direct mucosal eosinophil . ( 40,41 ) The investigator previously find high correlation anxiety score mucosal eosinophil density , provide preliminary support role CRH downstream eosinophil recruitment activation . ( 42 ) Stress also show shift relative proportion traffic T helper lymphocytes towards Th2 `` allergic '' phenotype . This shift driven catecholamines central CRH well CRH peripheral nerve inflammatory cell . The Th2 phenotype associate release IL 4 , IL 10 , IL 13 , stimulate growth activation mast cell eosinophils . ( 43 ) CRH also associate increased expression TNF-α , MCP1 , IL 8 , , turn , associate hyperalgesia . ( 44-46 ) As described , CRH initiate inflammatory cascade may lead pain directly indirectly cause dysmotility visceral hypersensitivity . The purpose current study describe microbiome child FD explore relationships microbiome postprandial distress syndrome , anxiety score , mucosal biomarkers anxiety . SPECIFIC AIMS 1 . To determine frequency relative proportion specific bacteria bacteria phyla child FD duodenal mucosal specimens stool sample . 2 . To determine frequency proportion specific bacteria bacteria phyla differ child without PDS . 3 . To determine bi-variate correlation bacteria/phyla frequency , bacteria/ phylum proportion , anxiety score , mucosal biomarkers , respectively .</detailed_description>
