	<brief_summary>The primary objective propose study determine use wireless method monitor record core body temperature Whole Body Hyperthermia treatment , compare indwell rectal thermometer . This protocol intend study difference rectal temperature probe approve wireless indigestible thermometer WBH session . The current standard monitoring core body temperature usage indwelling rectal thermometer . Many patient potential study subject , however , decline receive treatment , due discomfort use measure method wireless measure device would open possibility patient receive treatment . The primary endpoint example treatment MDD currently define reach rectal temperature 38.5 C. However , due proximity probe body 's surface , core body temperature vary rectal temperature comparison two method validation wireless device necessary . The investigator monitor subject 's physiological outcome single Whole Body Hyperthermia treatment open fashion ( placebo/control condition ) . This study include safety assessment 7 day several day prior day WBH , include follow-up assessment 1 day 1 week later .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pill Study Hyperthermia Device ( Heckel HT 3000 ) : Monitoring Core Body Temperature Using Wireless Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol allow evaluation wireless measure device core body temperature comparison data take rectal thermometer , Whole Body Hyperthermia ( WBH ) various subject population . The primary objective propose study potential change wire core body temperature measurement rectal thermometer indigestible thermometer wireless technology . The recent standard measure core body temperature WBH procedure use indwell rectal thermometer constantly monitor temperature safety research reason . Experiences different clinic research group , include , show high drop-out rate potential study participant patient , discomfort self-inserting rectal thermometer treatment Whole-Body Hyperthermia . A wireless reliable measuring technology would open treatment participant , decline participation due indwell thermometer . This device exit subject 's body via bowel movement 1-5 day follow ingestion reuse . Due proximity indwell thermometer surface body , temperature reflect real core body temperature preliminary data , take group , suggest significant , stable difference core body temperature measure indigestible device , compare temperature take rectal probe . WBH treatment , currently study group University Arizona , mild nature constant infra-red heating stop , soon patient reach rectal temperature 38.5 C. Due fact , body surface heat infrared exposure , investigator assume , core body temperature lower , compare rectal temperature . A validation study 20 subject therefore necessary determine difference measure method . This especially important , end-point treatment define core body temperature , different endpoint switch one measuring method , without validation , would potentially bias study result . Receiving treatment WBH machine non-significant risk compare e.g . sauna visit intense exercise , term physiological reaction . It currently study group treatment Major Depressive Disorder , PTSD chronic illness . This trial however limited include individual MDD PTSD , allow expand use population ( still exclude subject base safety parameter ) . The investigator monitor subject 's physiological clinical outcome ( applicable ) single Whole Body Hyperthermia treatment open fashion ( placebo/control condition ) . This study include safety assessment several day prior day WBH , include follow-up assessment 1 day 1 week later .</detailed_description>
