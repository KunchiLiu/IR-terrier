	<detailed_description>The overall objective study assess contribution diagnostic device dentist ' decision-making process surround suspicious occlusal carious lesion ( SOCL ) , assessment yet attempt , despite grow popularity device . SOCLs define occlusal surface area visual , tactile , radiographic sign insufficient definitively diagnose caries sign present.This study examines use two diagnostic device dental practitioner ' identification treatment SOCLs . During four-week pre-intervention period , 90 practitioner collect record descriptive treatment information SOCLs identify . Practitioners randomize one 3 study arm : diagnostic device , DIAGNOdent速 , Spectra速 , collect record similar information pre-intervention period another six week , enrol additional 20 SOCLs . They also complete diagnostic vignette begin end study , well post-study questionnaire utility device , assign device arm . Analyses examine difference proportion SOCLs treat surgically group without diagnostic device ; , treat surgically , difference proportion SOCLs extension dentin . Differences pre- post-study response vignettes suggest component decision-making process involve SOCL identification management modify use diagnostic device .</detailed_description>
