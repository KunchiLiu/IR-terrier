	<brief_summary>Toxic Shock Syndrome ( TSS ) severe condition high morbidity mortality result host overwhelm inflammatory response cytokine storm . Staphylococcal superantigen toxin main causative agent . Toxic shock syndrome toxin ( TSST-1 ) responsible almost menstruation associate 50 % case . There specific therapy . The aim study demonstrate safety tolerability BioMed recombinant toxic shock syndrome toxin ( rTSST-1 ) Variant Vaccine healthy adult . The second aim study measure antibodies blood healthy volunteer produce response treatment BioMed rTSST-1 Variant Vaccine . These antibody expect important resistance disease . 46 healthy adult , male female , age 18-64 year assign 6 dose group vaccine Department Clinical Pharmacology Medical University Vienna . The patient monitor vital sign , hematology , clinical chemistry , blood cytokine level antibody TSST-1 . Immunization repeat 4 week first dose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The BioMed rTSST-1 Variant Vaccine develop Biomedizinische ForschungsgmbH one component polyvalent staphylococcal vaccine prevention toxic shock hyperimmunization donor production TSST-1 immunoglobulin . This prospective , partly randomize , parallel control , dose escalation study safety immunogenicity BioMed rTSST1 Variant Vaccine compare adjuvant healthy adult . 28 - 3 day prior entry study , 50 male female subject 18 - 64 year age screen eligibility , screen criterion include physical examination , medical history , pregnancy/ adequate contraception female , HIV Ab , hepatitis C virus antibody ( HCV Ab ) , hepatitis B antigen ( HBs Ag ) TSST-1 Ab . 46 subject enter study . In first step , two subject receive adjuvanted Vaccine contain 100 ng rTSST-1 Ag one subject receive adjuvant contain 0.2 mg Al ( 0H ) 3 ( Group 1 ) . The subject see four time immunization period 14 day ( 6 h , 48 h + 2 hr , 7 + 1 day 14 + 2 day ) .Tests examination include vital sign , hematology clinical chemistry parameter , C-reactive protein , cytokine , TSST-Ab , local reaction adverse event . In absence clinically relevant adverse event , another three subject enter study one week later , two receive adjuvanted Vaccine contain 300 ng rTSST-1 Ag , one receiving adjuvant contain 0.6 mg Al ( 0H ) 3 ( Group 2 ) follow period 14 day describe . In absence clinically relevant adverse event , four subject enter study one week thereafter , three receive adjuvanted Vaccine contain 1 µg rTSST-1 Ag , one receive adjuvant contain 1 mg Al ( 0H ) 3 alone ( Group 3 ) , follow period 14 day manner describe . Immunization repeat dose level group one two month first . Follow-up . If immunogenicity show second administration Vaccine contain 1 µg rTSST-1 Ag , dose sample size increase Vaccine contain 3 µg , 10 µg , 30 µg adjuvant contain 1 mg Al ( 0H ) 3 nine three subject Groups 4 - 6 , respectively . Otherwise , sample size 3 + 1 continue immunogenicity see high dose level . Subjects Groups 4 - 6 receive second immunization respective dose level one two month first , follow-up Groups 1 - 3 . If immune response dose group second immunization , third injection give 4 - 8 week thereafter dose group 1 µg ( Groups 3 - 6 ) . Immunogenicity define seroconversion TSST-1 Ab titer &lt; 20 &gt; 40 4-fold increase TSST-1 Ab titer . Subjects receive vaccine contain 3 µg rTSST-1 Ag randomized .</detailed_description>
