	<brief_title>Effects Fruit Extracts Glycaemia : The GLU-FRU Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Diets high glycaemic load ( measure overall blood glucose-raising effect serve food ) containing high amount non-milk extrinsic sugar may contribute towards increase risk develop type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . Raised blood glucose level lead adverse modification functional protein within body eventually lead development T2D . Large peak blood glucose meal risk factor T2D , therefore desirable consume diet allow gradual rise blood glucose level meal . Fruit polyphenols may help control glycaemia follow carbohydrate meal beverage . Possible mechanisms include inhibition intestinal enzyme inhibition intestinal glucose absorption decrease SGLT1/GLUT2 transport activity . The scientific literature also suggest food rich polyphenols exert beneficial effect risk factor cardiovascular disease hypertension , lipid metabolism vascular function . Study Design : A randomised , control , double-blind , cross-over study conduct . Subjects receive combine blackcurrant apple polyphenols , apple polyphenols placebo random order 3 separate study visit immediately high-carbohydrate meal . Seven day wash-out period require study days.Standardised diet exercise advice give prior visit . Subjects arrive study visit 09.00 10.00 h , 12 h overnight fast . They cannulate forearm vein baseline fast blood sample take duplicate . All test drink blend equal volume , macronutrient energy content . Fruit extract instead whole fruit administer avoid confound effect fruit fibre/viscosity gastric empty rate . Following consumption test drink , high carbohydrate meal ( starch sucrose ) serve ( white bread apricot jam ) . Outcome variable measure postprandially 120 min post-meal .</detailed_description>
