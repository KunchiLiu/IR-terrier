	<brief_summary>This clinical trial open label Phase II study combination intravenously administer SGT-53 gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel patient metastatic pancreatic cancer first-line treatment . The objective study evaluate safety , tolerability , toxicity efficacy ( specifically Progression Free Survival 5.5 month ( PFS5.5mos ) ) combination therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Combined SGT-53 Plus Gemcitabine/Nab-Paclitaxel Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The p53 vital human tumor suppressor gene . Loss p53 suppressor function present majority human cancer . The p53 protein diverse range function include regulation cell cycle checkpoint , cell death ( apoptosis ) , senescence , DNA repair , maintenance genomic integrity , control angiogenesis . Abnormalities p53 gene may impact efficacy standard anticancer treatment radiation chemotherapy . P53 mutation pathway dysfunction associate poor clinical outcome presence p53 mutation correlate resistance chemotherapy radiation . The development somatic gene therapy create potential restore wild type function p53 . SGT-53 complex cationic liposome encapsulate normal human wild type p53 DNA sequence plasmid backbone . This complex show efficiently specifically deliver p53 cDNA tumor cell . Introduction p53 cDNA sequence expect restore wtp53 function apoptotic pathway . P53 restoration show effective enhance cytotoxicity combination agent result DNA damage initiate apoptosis . This Phase II clinical trial SGT-53 plus recently approve chemotherapeutic combination gemcitabine/Abraxane® ( nab-paclitaxel ) first-line therapy patient confirm metastatic pancreatic cancer . In addition determine Progression Free Survival 5.5 month ( PFS5.5mos ) , trial evaluate response rate , overall survival time progression well tolerability safety SGT-53 combination gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel .</detailed_description>
