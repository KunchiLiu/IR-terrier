	<brief_summary>In Israel , special qualification neurogenetics , 30 year career , find , characterize treat least 13 novel neurological disease . The genetic basis elucidate geneticist colleague Israel worldwide . The disease find encompass field pediatric neurology include intellectual disability , epilepsy , muscle-nerve disorder , malformation brain , microcephaly , macrocephaly , cerebellar ataxia , chorea . dystonia , cerebral palsy many symptom sign . We especially interested consanguineous family , parent first second degree cousin . These family often bear autosomal - recessive disease . If family informative - 2 affected child - current genetic technique good chance find causative gene specific disease . This theoretical - academic accomplishment . In practice , discover gene , family give genetic counseling pregnancy geneticists examine either preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) amniocentesis embryo affect . In early stage pregnancy embryo indeed affected disease cause gene find religious official consent , genetic counseling offer termination pregnancy couple . Needless say , know immense burden affect child family , community society . The parent guilt-ridden , affected child draw extensive resource educational , health rehabilitation authority . We contribute well-being family clan ( many time relative affect ) . We perform sophisticated genetic study Whole Genome Sequencing Whole Exome Sequencing.After informative family recruit study , explain aim research . The parent eligible patient sign inform consent form , accord local Helsinki Board . Blood sample take Israel , DNA extract Israeli lab ship coded researcher USA Germany . If researcher find new gene family notify give appropriate genetic counseling . We continue follow treat family onwards .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Finding Genes With NGS Techniques Whom Mutations Cause Neurological Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Israel various sub-populations tendency consanguinity . Among Arab-Muslim , Druze , Bedouin , Sephardi Jews lesser extent Ashkenazi Jews . Consanguinity ( especially 2 first cousin ) expose couple various genetic disease risk 25 % per pregnancy . This phenomenon base Mendelian autosomal-recessive inheritance . When couple family clan , even ethnic origin , probability `` dormant '' abnormal gene pass generation intermarriage , thus render couple `` carrier '' produce risk 25 % offspring affect . Many autosomal-recessive disease neurological feature : developmental delay , intellectual disability , epilepsy motor and/or sensory impairment . These disease carry heavy burden family , community educational , health welfare authority . The disabled child often handicap , go special education program , independent daily living task , often sick need hospitalization . They grow need special housing facility . Their life span usually short normal . These child dependent parent , subdue parent misery , interparental conflict susceptibility divorce . Most neurological disease untreatable nowadays . Most medical effort focus prevention . For example , find gene specific neurological condition , could search gene couple 's next pregnancy . If fetus find affected could offer genetic counseling possibility pregnancy termination family avoids birth affect sibling . When individual neurogenetic disease enrol study careful history take characterize neurological syndrome , see family member affect condition , pedigree drawn . We compare neurological sign symptom information data web like `` PUBMED '' `` Online Mendelian Inheritance Man '' , n't find similar description refer family harbor new disease novel gene . We work neurogenetic colleague abroad like Dr. Andy Singleton National Institute Aging , NIH , U.S.A Dr. Markus Schuelke Charite Hospital , Berlin , Germany . We take search family , explain purpose research consequence . If suspect new gene , ask parent patient sign inform consent form accord approve Helsinki board . We take sample 10 cc blood order extract DNA . The DNA extract genetic lab Israel . A cod DNA send researcher abroad . After 12 year sample return coded lab Israel . The researcher abroad use homozygosity mapping technique well NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING like WHOLE EXOME SEQUENCING WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING . If new gene find arrange proper genetic counseling explain implication genetic data individual family . We provide family symptomatic palliative therapy need .</detailed_description>
