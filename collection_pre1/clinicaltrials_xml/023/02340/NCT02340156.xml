	<brief_title>Phase II Study Combined Temozolomide SGT-53 Treatment Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The p53 vital human tumor suppressor gene . Loss p53 suppressor function present majority human cancer . The p53 protein diverse range function include regulation cell cycle checkpoint , cell death ( apoptosis ) , senescence , DNA repair , maintenance genomic integrity , control angiogenesis . Abnormalities p53 gene may impact efficacy standard anticancer treatment radiation chemotherapy . P53 mutation pathway dysfunction associate poor clinical outcome presence p53 mutation correlate resistance chemotherapy radiation . The development somatic gene therapy create potential restore wild type function p53 . SGT-53 complex cationic liposome encapsulate normal human wild type p53 DNA sequence plasmid backbone . This complex show efficiently specifically deliver p53 cDNA tumor cell cross blood-brain barrier . Introduction p53 cDNA sequence expect restore wtp53 function apoptotic pathway . P53 restoration show effective enhance cytotoxicity combination agent result DNA damage initiate apoptosis . The primary mechanism resistance current standard chemotherapeutic agent Temozolomide ( TMZ ) overexpression O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyl transferase ( MGMT ) , repair TMZ-induced DNA lesion remove o6-guanine adduct . Thus , mean modulate MGMT activity would enhance therapeutic effect TMZ . A number report indicate increase wtp53 expression down-regulate expression DNA repair gene MGMT increase sensitivity tumor cell alkylating agent . This Phase II clinical trial tumor-targeted SGT-53 nanocomplex combination chemotherapeutic agent , temozolomide standard care Glioblastoma Multiforme ( GBM ) brain tumor . We propose test combination SGT-53 standard temozolomide determine efficacy safety patient confirm glioblastoma proven tumor recurrence progression .</detailed_description>
