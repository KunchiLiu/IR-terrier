	<brief_title>A Study Cediranib Olaparib Time Ovarian Cancer Worsens Olaparib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cediranib work block ( inhibit ) several specific protein cancer cell call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptor . These protein important formation blood vessel tumor . It believe many tumor survive blood vessel tumor bring oxygen nutrient cancer cell enable grow . If formation blood vessel block , tumor cell may die . Olaparib work block protein call poly [ adenosine diphosphate-ribose ] polymerase ( PARP ) . PARP important protein try fix damage deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA , molecules contain important instruction development cell ) . Many cancer though develop damage DNA . By block PARP fix damage DNA , tumor cell may die . Adding cediranib olaparib , therefore block several different mechanism cancer growth , may stop tumor growth .</detailed_description>
