	<brief_summary>The primary purpose research study evaluate safe , well tolerate effective range dose L-DOS47 patient non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer give monotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Open-Label , Non-Randomized Dose Escalation Study Immunoconjugate L-DOS47</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients recruit cohort , minimum three maximum six patient per cohort . All patient give dose level must complete Cycle 1 ( 3 week period ) escalation subsequent patient proceed . The decision dose escalation next dose level make safety available pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data review Trial Steering Committee ( TSC ) . Escalation L-DOS47 continue maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) reach . After MTD L-DOS47 determine Phase I , 20 patient enrol ( take forward Phase I ) evaluate preliminary efficacy L-DOS47 ( i.e. , response rate use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours [ RECIST ] version 1.1 criterion , disease progression survival ) ; monitor include radiologic evaluation every second cycle . The safety tolerability L-DOS47 also evaluate . Pharmacokinetic information collect well relevant observation activity L-DOS47 . For patient , treatment L-DOS47 continue either patient experience disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient withdraws consent complete four treatment cycle wish continue additional cycle , whichever occur first . After four cycle , patient may continue receive L-DOS47 long sustain clinical benefit well tolerate , opinion Investigator .</detailed_description>
