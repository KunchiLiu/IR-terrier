	<brief_summary>Clinical trial bite splint use night time tooth grinding perform . Consequently , definitive outcome measure efficacy standard apply large clinical trial . The present preliminary trial determine objective measure use evaluate efficacy . The outcome variables fall four category : ( 1 ) fabrication efficacy , ( 2 ) compliance , ( 3 ) functional efficacy , ( 4 ) user satisfaction . The immediate goal : ( 1 ) focus over-the counter SOVA night guard , ( 2 ) conduct test control clinical condition use 'gold standard ' , acrylic 'bite splint ' 'orthotic ' , hereafter call `` Michigan bite splint '' , compare performance efficacy SOVA night guard . Subsequent study able use outcome variable identify study broader clinical trial . Specific Aim 1 . To compare SOVA night guard custom-acrylic Michigan bite splint clinical laboratory condition . Hypothesis : There significant difference device term fabrication efficacy , functional efficacy user satisfaction . Specific Aim 2 . To compare SOVA night guard custom-acrylic Michigan bite splint ecologically relevant condition , i.e. , home environment . Hypothesis : There significant difference device term compliance functional efficacy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nocturnal Mouth Guards , SOVA vs. Standard Acrylic Orthotic ; Phase IV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects . Sample size estimation base upon recent review randomize clinical trial , acrylic appliance evaluate ( see Appendix 2 ( Huynh et al. , 2007 ) ) . The mean +/- 1 standard deviation ( SD ) number bruxism episodes per hour Michigan bite splint 3.97 + 0.58 , palatal splint , mean +/- 1 SD 4.45 + 0.63 . Using mean high SD ( 0.63 ) , along alpha = 0.05 beta = 0.8 , study would sufficiently power sample size 29 per group . Based Michigan study , wherein recruitment , exclusion attrition rate know , estimate initial screen sample size 120 necessary end 29 per group . There two treatment group : group receive supervise train fabrication SOVA night guard ( SOVA ) group receive Michigan custom-acrylic bite splint ( MI BS ) . Two group time 29 subject per group equal 58 total need analysis . Care take match randomize group age , ethnicity , gender temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) signs/symptoms . Alternatively modeled nuisance variable attrition rate create bias lack sufficiently size screening pool . Screening . Candidates undergo screen assess co-morbidities identify inclusion exclusion criterion . Standard questionnaires screen instrument brief clinical exam perform . Subjects meet acceptance criterion randomly assign one two group use stratified randomization procedure ( Suresh , 2011 ) . Alginate impression take , impression pour stone . The model use either fabricate MI BS ass SOVA appliances fabrication efficacy . Splint delivery . For SOVA group , subject ask fabricate SOVA device clinical laboratory receive feedback train calibrate study 'instructors ' . Fabrication use manufacturer instruction . Calibrated instructor blind study 's objective , subject . A `` Michigan '' acrylic bite splint fabricate use standard clinical practice check fit quality subject assign MI BS group . Subjective fabrication assessment . Standardized questionnaire box scale use assess ease fabrication , ease instruction , relate issue device . Quantitative fabrication assessment . Four aspect fabrication evaluate investigator : ( 1 ) stability—does device move independently maxilla mandible stabilized device , ( 2 ) retention—does device resist displacement , ( 3 ) tissue adaptation—how much spacing exist maxilla device device mandible , ( 4 ) health teeth , gingival , tongue , palate lip . Stability retention quantitatively assess jaw movement ( MaxTraq motion analysis system , Innovision , Columbiaville , MI ) electromyography ( EMG ) ( LabChart , ADInstruments , Colorado Springs , CO ) data force sensor . For position-stability assessment , maxilla , mandible splint simultaneously record least three site capture 6 degree movement freedom . Subjects clench , grind , perform close border movement vacuous chewing ( verified EMG force sensor ) . For retention assessment , subject perform series test design dislodge device , e.g. , tapping , force blowing , cough , chew gum . Stability retention index create base whether device movement vary independently jaw movement apply bite force , force sensor output varies dislodgement exercise . Deviations use form standardized index stability retention , small value represent great stability retention . Note major part study develop appropriate method make measurement , clear do ideally . Tissue adaptation assess 3D laser scanner . The occlusal , facial lingual surface upper arch scan inner surface night guard . An index adaptation develop base volumetric space separate teeth device , use topological software . Smaller volume represent good tissue adaptation . Volumetric index compare device via ANOVA appropriate statistical method . Note major part study develop accurate precise way measure volumetric spacing , method yet develop . Tissue health assess via appropriate , standard method currently use cariology periodontology clinical study ( Monse et al. , 2012 ; Tirapellia et al. , 2010 ) . Baseline measurement compare post-device wear measurement . Between-group difference study repeated measure ANOVA appropriate statistical method . Compliance assessment . Compliance assessment focus : ( 1 ) often device worn , ( 2 ) whether device remove inappropriate time night , ( 3 ) whether alternative device use . Compliance assess via subject self-report , nocturnal EMG record device microwear method . Subjects would blind purpose technological method . Occlusal microwear pattern unique surface occlusion occur , microwear change daily basis ( Ungar et al. , 2003 ) . Hence , microwear assessment provide definitive evidence splint compliance . Microwear analysis method develop part study purpose . Functional efficacy . Two question address functional efficacy : ( 1 ) device alter bruxing activity , ( 2 ) teeth device hold bruxing activity . Some technology use compliance assessment , , use . Gold standard method evaluate bruxing activity rely polysomnography ( PSG ) EMG activity ; therefore , technology use well . To address second question , teeth hold , 3-D laser scan technology develop use measure change macroscopic tooth structure , confocal microscopy scale-sensitive fractal analysis assess utiliity diagnose microwear . User satisfaction . This assessed series standardize questionnaire adopt clinical study , e.g. , Oral Health Impact Profile ( Slade Spencer , 1994 ) , Tampa Scale Kinesiophobia : TMD ( Visscher et al. , 2010 ) , TMD pain screener ( Gonzalez et al. , 2011 ) . Questionnaires use SISU field test ( SISU mouthguards preliminary result ) , well forced choice , box scale statistical method develop another study ( Lin , 2008 ; Lin et al. , 2013 ) also prove useful assessment patient satisfaction . Also question , device hurt pinch anywhere , bite feel 'off ' first remove guard , etc . use ass specific aspect user satisfaction . Repeated measure ( Week 1 check-up 4 Month check-up ) . Compliance , stability , retention , tissue adaptation health , functional efficacy user satisfaction assess two time , viz. , 1 week delivery 4 month delivery . This provide rigorous data set , reduce subject attrition thus allow publication clinical trial pursue .</detailed_description>
