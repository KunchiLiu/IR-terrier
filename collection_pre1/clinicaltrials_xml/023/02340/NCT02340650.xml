	<brief_summary>This pilot study involve 100 subject . The primary aim conduct image analysis use High resolution micro-endoscope profile normal bladder tissue , inflame bladder tissue , suspicious bladder tissue bladder cancer tissue . The secondary aim examine effectiveness new ( HRME ) device early diagnosis bladder cancer less invasive procedure . This pilot study examine image analysis patient normal bladder tissue , inflame bladder tissue , suspicious bladder tissue , bladder cancer schedule cystoscopy . This cross sectional study therefore , patient participate study . The study involve 1 visit : Visit # 1 : schedule cystoscopy biopsy procedure part standard care capture image use HRME device part research procedure . All procedure perform study normally do work-up patient schedule cystoscopy procedure consider routine procedure bladder cancer screening . The procedure/treatment routine use High resolution microendoscope . Biopsy take time cystoscopy involve standard care . Images take HRME device correlate pathology result biopsied tissue . The sample cod de-identified data send Dr. Kortum 's laboratory correlation . The blood urine sample collect screen visit routine test patient bladder cancer handle accord standard practice . The test result include subject 's research medical chart . Additional research related information provide end study . Risks include relate cystoscopy HRME device may include infection , pain , difficulty urination blood urine , perforation . Potential benefit may include subject class early detection bladder cancer minimal invasive technique . Understanding effect HRME device bladder screening may improve screen detection methodology future patient bladder cancer .</brief_summary>
