	<brief_title>Long Duration Therapeutic Ultrasound Tendon Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ability long duration therapeutic ultrasound reduce pain , increase strength , improve quality life patient tendon injury [ e.g . tendinopathy elbow ( medial lateral ] , Achilles tendon , patellar tendon ) assess . During 7-week protocol , participant receive 4 continuous hour therapy daily . For first week , baseline data collect participant report pain score ( VAS ) morning , noon , night . During next 6 week , participant self-apply device day record pain score ( VAS ) treatment ; record pain score ( VAS ) perform specify movement design evaluate tendon rehabilitation . At bi-weekly site visit , strength measurement perform injured uninjured limb . Participants also complete standardized questionnaire ass disability due specific tendon injury baseline study conclusion .</detailed_description>
