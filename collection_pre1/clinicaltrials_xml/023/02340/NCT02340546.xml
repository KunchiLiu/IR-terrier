	<brief_title>Trajectory Changes Coronary Sinus Lead Tip Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) become standard treatment patient symptomatic chronic systolic heart failure , reduce leave ventricular ( LV ) function wide electrocardiographic ventricular ( QRS ) complex , approximately one third patient respond treatment . Current ability predict long-term response CRT implant slight . Investigations focus mostly early prediction reversal LV remodeling mean LV pacing , deliver frequently biventricular pacing , combine conventional right ventricular ( RV ) pacing . LV dyssynchrony area identify suitable target pace , method still evaluate real-time , intra-operative acute effect pace LV mechanic . This issue become even evident subset CS implant quadripolar lead , offer relevant advantage highlight lack method select pace configuration among safe effective one . Since LV pace currently deliver epicardium lead insert coronary sinus ( CS ) branch , interface point pace delivery LV surface underlie LV wall , overall lead movement inside coronary sinus might describe underlie myocardial mechanic . By mean recently publish fluoroscopy-based method , trajectory electrode tip insert CS branch reconstruct three-dimensions ( 3D ) throughout cardiac cycle . A preliminary clinical pilot study ( Heart Rhythm 2013 ; 10:1360 ) demonstrate biventricular pacing acutely induced change trajectory geometry , correlate echocardiographic volumetric response CRT six-month post-implant follow-up . In responder , biventricular pace abruptly determine circular shape . Such result `` hypothesis-generating '' yet test large scale . The study analyze predictive power change pace cathode trajectory metric occur start biventricular pace respect : 1. volumetric response CRT , measure six-month follow-up unique criterion ; 2. clinical response CRT , describe six-month follow-up three clinical index . Secondarily , study evaluate whether trajectory variation would able acutely guide selection definitive LV pace configuration subset implant CS quadripolar lead . The trajectory geometry metric analyze : - trajectory length ; - area surface encompass trajectory 3D space ; - trajectory mean curvature ; - three singular value indicate extent trajectory distribute along three principal direction ( eigenvectors ) ; - ratio two main singular value , indicate extent trajectory distribute along one ( principal ) direction ; - trajectory eccentricity ; - distance trajectory barycenter . Operatively : - patient submit implant CRT device ( pacemaker implantable cardioverter defibrillator ) accord current indication evaluate ; - market-released CRT device implant ; choice CS lead , implantation technique , lead placement leave investigator decision ; - implant procedure , device program sense-only mode ; upgrade , pre-existing pacing program keep unmodified start biventricular stimulation ; - short fluoroscopy recording lead movement inside CS branch take three radiological projection ( posteroanterior , 30° right leave anterior oblique ) , immediately begin biventricular pace prefixed setting , : low rate 60-70 beat per min ; atrioventricular ( AV ) delay 120 m interventricular ( VV ) delay 0 m ; - subset implant quadripolar lead , two fluoroscopic recording acutely acquire short period pace two cathode , predefined 20-35 mm 40-50 mm lead tip ; - 3D trajectory reconstruct lead tip ( distal pole ) , , quadripolar lead implant , also two pace cathode , acutely biventricular pace start ; - acquisition , time pace setting optimize modified investigator choice ; - quadripolar CS lead use , pace configuration discharge preferably choose associate large change cathode trajectory towards circular shape biventricular pace start ; - CRT device check schedule 6-month follow-up ; check leave discretion center ; visit advise 30-60 day discharge ; - center arrange two index echocardiographic evaluation perform schedule expert operator , blind trajectory result , accord recommendation American Society Echocardiography . All examination record external support ( analogic digital ) hand internal Echocardiography Core-Lab , identify among participate institution . The Echo Core-Lab operator ( ) directly involve study keep unaware trajectory result end study ; - fluoroscopic recording store CD analyze off-line Engineering Core Lab , use method previously publish . The following variable collect baseline - age , gender , height weight ; presence diabetes , hypertension , chronic obstructive bronchopneumopathy , previous stroke , previous myocardial infarction ; moderate severe valvular heart disease ; previous myocardial revascularization ; previous heart surgery ; chronic renal failure , define glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 square metre ; current value eGFR ( mL/min/1.73 square metre ) ; current medical treatment beta-blockers , diuretic , ACE inhibitor , angiotensin II antagonist , aldosterone antagonist , antiarrhythmic , oral anticoagulant , anti-platelets . The following variable collect peri-implant six-month follow-up : 1 . Clinical : New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional class ( I IV ) ; distance cover six minute walk test ( metre ) ; total hospital stay due heart failure 6 month 6 month CRT implant ( number day ) . 2 . Echocardiographic : LV ejection fraction ( % ) ; LV end-diastolic end-systolic volume ( ml ) ; presence degree valvular regurgitation ( 1+ 4+ ) valvular stenosis ; Doppler-derived peak pressure pulmonary artery ( mmHg ) ; pulse doppler pattern transmitral flow ( three type ) associate E/A ratio ( ab ) , E wave duration ( msec ) , A wave duration ( msec ) , E+A wave total duration ( msec ) . 3 . Electrocardiographic : P wave , AV interval QRS complex duration ( msec ) ; QRS axis ( degree ) ; QRS morphology ( four type : spontaneous typical atypical leave bundle branch block ; RV pace-induced conduction delay ; non-specific intraventricular delay ) . 4 . Device-related : endocavitary measurement atrial , RV CS lead functioning ( pace sense threshold , impedance ) ; program value sense pacing ; program AV VV interval ; total percent time LV pacing ; burden type supraventricular ventricular tachyarrhythmias . To define sample size , statistical power analysis apply level power equal 80 % , use sample distribution population pilot study ( p &lt; 0.05 ) consider drop-out rate 20 % . Descriptive statistic use present summarize data collect study . For discrete variable , frequency distribution cross tabulation present . For continuous variable , mean , standard deviation , median 25° 75° percentile range use represent data . According type variable , compute trajectory parameter compare use χ2 method , Fisher exact test nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test non-normal distribution ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Differences mean proportion calculate , together 95 % confidence interval . Variations trajectory metric pace start compute correlated variation pre-implant six-month post-implant assessment echocardiographic measure leave ventricular remodel function clinical electrocardiographic variable .
