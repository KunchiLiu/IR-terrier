	<brief_title>Study BMN-673 With Carboplatin Paclitaxel Patients With Advanced BRCA-mutated Solid Tumor Triple Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PARP1/2 inhibitor novel class anticancer agent show activity tumor defect DNA repair may induce synthetic lethality combination agent induce DNA damage prevent DNA repair . The rationale study determine whether DNA damage agent potentiate cell death induce PARP inhibitor individual tumor susceptible chemotherapy . The study evaluate potential benefit BMN 673 combination weekly carboplatin patient metastatic tumor associate BRCA germ line mutation patient triple negative breast cancer know BRCA mutation , subsequently tolerate , additional cohort examine feasibility add paclitaxel combination solid tumor malignancy potential benefit combination . This first study evaluate safety efficacy BMN 673 combination carboplatin patient either BRCA mutation TNBC . If tolerable paclitaxel add combination solid tumor malignancy potential benefit combination .</detailed_description>

Dose Escalation : Patients solid tumor malignancy Does Expansion : Patients advanced malignancy germline and/or somatic BRCA mutation ( cohort gBRCA ) Or Triple negative ( TN ) metastatic breast cancer without know BRCA mutation ( cohort TNBC ) . Tumors consider TN : Estrogen receptor ( ER ) expression &lt; 1 % Progesterone receptor ( PR ) expression &lt; 1 % Her2 negative per ASCO guideline Paclitaxel expansion : solid tumor malignancy potential benefit combination paclitaxel ( ASP ) . Dose expansion cohort : Histological cytological confirmation advance unresectable solid tumor standard therapy available patient know BRCA germline mutation metastatic triple negative breast cancer without know BRCA mutation ( see inclusion criterion one definition triple negative breast cancer ) ..
