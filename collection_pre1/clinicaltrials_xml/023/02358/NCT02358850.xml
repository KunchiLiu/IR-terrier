	<brief_summary>This randomize prospective study determine optimal postoperative pain medication regimen adult ( 18 year old old ) undergo tonsillectomy without adenoidectomy chronic tonsillitis and/or snore and/or obstructive sleep apnea . All participant undergo tonsillectomy surgical technique ( without adenoidectomy ) general anesthesia randomize one three postoperative pain control regimens ( commonly use pain medication post-tonsillectomy pain ) : 1 . Norco ( Hydrocodone Acetaminophen ) 2 . Percocet ( Oxycodone Acetaminophen ) 3 . Dilaudid Tylenol ( Acetaminophen ) Participants discharge home day surgery send home questionnaire assess daily pain level , oral intake , amount nausea/vomiting , amount pain medication take 14 day follow surgery . Data collect analyzed determine difference pain level oral intake nausea/vomiting different pain regimen group . Secondary endpoint include weight change preoperative weight weight 2-3 week surgery addition postoperative complication include visit Emergency Department post-tonsillectomy bleed rate . Participants see 1-2 week follow surgery ENT ( Ear , Nose Throat ) clinic per normal postoperative protocol require specific clinic visit relate study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypotheses - There optimal pain control regimen post-tonsillectomy pain control adults - Post-tonsillectomy pain level adult peak around postoperative day number seven - Post-tonsillectomy adult return slowly normal ( pre-surgery ) oral intake diet Purpose - To assess daily post-tonsillectomy pain level adult two week surgery - To determine optimal post-tonsillectomy pain control regimen adults two week surgery - To determine oral intake level post-tonsillectomy adult two week surgery - To determine daily amount nausea/vomiting post-tonsillectomy adult two week surgery - To determine change weight two three week surgery Study Background Tonsillectomy ( without adenoidectomy ) common procedure child adult . The common indication tonsillectomy include chronic tonsillitis and/or obstructive sleep apnea . While many study examine optimal postoperative pain control regimen child , optimal pain control regimen adult remain poorly study understood . Literature regard post-tonsillectomy pain adult primarily focus specific tonsillectomy surgical technique ( many ) rather exact medication use pain control . Interestingly , aforementioned study include name , type quantity pain medication give patient primary study endpoint pain . Additional study examine role steroid , antibiotic , and/or pain medication give Anesthesia patient anesthetize undergoing tonsillectomy determine reduce postoperative pain . IV steroids give perioperatively adults undergo tonsillectomy less pain , nausea , vomit first day tonsillectomy . IV steroids routinely give tonsillectomy practice Otolaryngologists , include senior author . There limited number study look actual postoperative pain control regimens adult . Most study limit look first 24 hour follow surgery rather trend pain level first week two surgery . Additional study limit observational prospective without comparative pain regimen group ( i.e . give patient medication ask daily pain level ) . Furthermore , majority study involve postoperative pain control use `` cold steel '' technique tonsillectomy , uncommonly practice United States Otolaryngologists , prefer use electrocautery device tonsillectomy . It well know accept cautery cause postoperative pain due thermal tissue injury , however allow straightforward surgery well intraoperative control bleeding . Furthermore , randomize prospective study postoperative pain control follow cautery tonsillectomy lack literature . It well know expect recovery period adult 2-4 week , work strenuous activity . We would argue first 24 hour tonsillectomy actually well tolerate adult receive high potency narcotic ( usually IV ) right surgery . Therefore meaningful time period study would postoperative day number 1 - 14 , patient home pain severe ( patient state pain peak around postoperative number 5-7 ) . Pain control incredibly important issue post-tonsillectomy patient . If much pain , drink eat enough stay hydrate nourished . This lead electrolyte abnormality dehydration require visit Emergency Department without admission hospital . The purpose study evaluate post-tonsillectomy pain control adult use three randomized medication regimen . All patient would undergo surgical technique avoid confound variable . Surgeries would perform Otolaryngology - Head Neck Surgery Residents direct supervision Otolaryngology staff attend surgeon . All propose pain regimens commonly accept regimen use practice Otolaryngologists adult . Patients would ask complete questionnaire numerically evaluate daily : pain level , amount oral intake , amount nausea/vomiting , amount pain medication use . They would ask mail result return clinic . Additional information would collect patient and/or medical record include visit emergency department , readmission hospital , postoperative complication include post-tonsillectomy bleeding . Data would compile analyzed determine typical postoperative pain level , daily oral intake level , compare different pain regimen determine one superior . It important note accept risk general anesthesia undergo tonsillectomy without adenoidectomy . Participation study would change accept risk undergo surgical procedure . The risk commonly discuss patient tonsillectomy without adenoidectomy include failure resolve chronic throat infection , failure resolve obstructive sleep apnea , voice change surgery , damage lips/teeth/tongue , taste change , dehydration , need return emergency department , need admission hospital , 3-5 % risk post-tonsillectomy bleeding may result need additional surgical procedure and/or blood transfusion .</detailed_description>
