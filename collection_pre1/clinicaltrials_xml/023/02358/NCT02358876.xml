	<detailed_description>In Clinic : Participants arrive clinic deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) turn previously prescribe Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) medication . Motion sensor unit place index finger , thumb , wrist participant 's affected hand . The participant perform three repetitive motion task two tremor evaluation task , perform 15 second . The task include repetitive finger-tapping , hand opening-closing , pronation-supination , well arm rest arm extend . The sequence five task repeat ( 10 task performance total ) test-retest reliability examine . The participant 's DBS system turn . The two repetition five motor task repeat 10 minute , 20 minute , 30 minute DBS turn measure after-effects DBS washout . During task performance , motion data stream motion sensor nearby computer storage . The participant 's hand videoed subsequent clinical scoring . After set assessment ( three time point turn DBS ) , participant ask rate his/her `` slowness movement '' 0-4 scale . The participant 's DBS system turn back he/she leave clinic . To examine test-retest reliability , motion sensor-based score compare clinician rating . Videos participant sit randomize , present movement disorder neurologist clinical rating . The clinician blind participant 's identity much possible obscure everything participant 's hand . At Home : Before data collection begin , technician give participant Kinesia One system ( one motion sensor unit , inductive charge-pad , tablet computer ) take home train him/her use . The movement task perform explained detail ensure participant familiar . The participant require perform task use system twice independently leave clinic ensure he/she fully understand use system . The time take participant independently set system record . The system use two week , return clinic either person pre-paid shipping box . During two-week data collection , participant perform motor assessment three day per week ( six day total ) . On assessment day , assessment perform six time per day , space approximately two hour apart . All assessment perform DBS turn ON . To begin assessment , participant sit front tablet computer . The software guide participant data collection procedure . The participant instruct remove motion sensor unit charge pad place appropriately index finger affect hand . Software guide participant assessment , consist three repetitive motion task two tremor evaluation task , perform 15 second . The sequence five task repeat second time ( 10 task performance total ) test-retest reliability examine . All data upload secure server . After assessment , participant enter rating corresponding perceive slowness movement Parkinson 's state . Each week paper diary mail back within three day complete provided , pre-addressed stamp envelope .</detailed_description>
