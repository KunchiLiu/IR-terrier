	<detailed_description>End stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient undergo hemodialysis ( HD ) high level blood marker body make response increase stress injury . An increase marker show related cardiovascular disease death ESRD patient . It believe take antioxidant ( e.g . Vitamin E ) may decrease marker . In previous study ESRD patient HD , consumption Vitamin E tocotrienol-rich fraction ( TRF ) find improve marker . The current study follow large group patient long time period ( 1 year ) document effect additional marker The study document extent supplementation TRF improve marker inflammation , oxidative stress well blood lipid ESRD patient chronic HD compare placebo . Additionally , study aim document improvement Restless Legs Syndrome - tingle sensation leg - ( RLS ) TRF , base standard questionnaire . The study last 15 month . At start study basic patient information evaluate related monthly dialysis lab , inflammation oxidative stress marker well general information patient relation kidney disease . Patients randomize one two group . One group receive TRF , daily , 12 month second group receive placebo , daily , 12 month . Capsules administer dialysis clinic/unit start dialysis session ( thrice weekly ) , patient provide capsule consume home remain four day week . During 12 month treatment period , patient question every three month dialysis unit study staff obtain information dialysis lab , medical condition , hospitalization , check see take study capsule . As part routine standard care , patient continue monthly blood draw . For purpose study , trimonthly blood draw , obtain additional blood examine marker related oxidative stress , inflammation lipid . A blood sample also collect 15 month ( 3 month patient stop take capsule ) . Therefore course entire study , blood obtain baseline 3 , 6 , 9 12 month ( plus 15 month follow-up sample ) . At trimonthly blood draw include follow-up visit 15 month , patient also verbally administer Restless Legs Syndrome Questionnaire . In addition dietitian member research team administer 24 hr diet recall questionnaire Sample size base inflammatory marker ( hsCRp IL-6 ) report early study sample size 175 per group estimate achieve 80 % power p=0.05 significance level . Thus account potential drop-outs 1 year study , target recruitment 400 patient total ( 200 group ) Detroit , MI . ( A similar study , follow similar protocol use study design intervention recruit 400 patient total ( 200 group ) Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia ) .</detailed_description>
