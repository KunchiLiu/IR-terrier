	<brief_summary>With propose project seek advance detection diagnosis breast cancer outpatient breast clinic . Novel sonographic approach scrutinize . The first aim study explore whether advantage ductosonography conventional breast sonography detect localize breast lesion compare diagnostic accuracy ductosonography conventional breast sonography detect suspicious unclear sonographic lesions.In Addition , reliability time requirement ductosonographic examination investigate . The second specific aim investigate potential tissue elasticity diagnostic marker solid breast lesion ( US-BI-RADS 3 , 4 5 ) elastosonography . The study design allow investigate reproducibility method .</brief_summary>
