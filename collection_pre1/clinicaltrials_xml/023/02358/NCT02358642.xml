	<brief_summary>Background : Older people neurological dysphagia risk recurrent aspiration pneumonia . Angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) show improve swallow cough reflex may protect dysphagic patient aspiration pneumonia . Hypotheses : ACEI reduce risk pneumonia old patient nasogastric tube feed dysphagia cerebrovascular disease . Design : Randomized placebo control trial Method : 302 old patient tube feed two week dysphagia secondary cerebrovascular disease randomize take half lisinopril 5 mg placebo tablet daily 26 week . The subject recruit medical ward Prince Wales Shatin Hospitals , outpatient geriatric speech therapy clinic , hospital stay previous three month . The subject follow week 12 26 . The primary outcome incidence rate pneumonia determine pneumonic change X ray clinical criterion . The secondary outcome mortality rate , total episode pneumonia 26 week , swallow ability define Royal Brisbane Hospital Outcome Measure week 12 . Cost effectiveness analysis public health care personal health care cost perform . Intention treat log rank use analyze group difference outcomes . 60 subject ( 30 trial group ) recruit medical inpatient Prince Wales Hospital undergo swallow videofluoscopy baseline week 12 follow-up .</brief_summary>
