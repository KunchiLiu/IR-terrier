	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether intermittent nasogastric enteral feeding , rather conventional continuous enteral feeding , preserve muscle mass critically ill ( Primary end-point ) . Such maintenance may translate improve outcomes include reduce length intensive care unit ( ICU ) and/or hospital stay , well number day ventilator . In addition , long-term improvement health-related quality life physical activity level may result ICU survivor back community . Indeed , benefit could translate reduction primary healthcare usage relate cost ( secondary end-points ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase II pilot single-blinded randomize control trial conduct two adult intensive care unit . Technically , patient blind ( virtue illness ) , case knowledge feed intervention receive would influence outcome . Scans take staff could potentially aware treatment ; keep scanner personnel blind would involve complex logistics separate randomising , scan patient , collect data ; however , investigators n't think individual take scan would introduce material bias . Importantly , scan analyse individual ( base off-site ) blind treatment status . Within 24 hour admission ICU , patient recruit study randomise either intermittent enteral feed continuous enteral feed - regimen deliver nutritional content 24 hour period . The intermittent feed regimen consist six bolus feed ( one bolus every four hour ) continuous feed regimen consist total volume feed administer 24 hour . Feed volume group commence accord standard 'usual practice ' protocol delay feeding , patient individual regimen calculate dietician . Feeding continue either intermittent continuous duration trial period tolerate . Ultrasound thigh ( enable derivation Rectus Femoris cross sectional area ( RFCSA ) ) perform Days 1,7,10 ( discharge , sooner ) , hospital discharge ( Day 10 ) , blood urine sample take daily . The hospital discharge destination note , functional assessment determine prior hospital discharge two validate method previously use patient cohort ( 6-Minute Walk Distance Short Performance Battery Test ) . Patients ' health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) determine pre-morbid period 12 month post ICU-discharge use Short Form-36 health survey ; primary care cost since discharge also ascertain .</detailed_description>
