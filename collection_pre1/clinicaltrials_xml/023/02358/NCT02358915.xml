	<brief_title>A Two-step Training Paradigm Voluntary Control Peri-auricular Muscles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Survivors spinal cord injury ( SCI ) usually severe mobility limitation due paralysis.In order improve independence living patient , scientist engineer invent many different type assistive device , breath control `` sip puff '' device , speech control device , eye movement control device , head movement control device . However , one limitation previous design require usurping intact function functional organ like mouth eye . A recent design Reach Bionic 's company take advantage set ear muscles—the peri-auricular muscles—that present 95 % population , serve physiologic function human . These muscle innervate branch cranial nerve control brain stem , spinal cord . Therefore , unlikely affect even high SCI . The design intention translate ear contraction signal muscle meaningful control signal direct wheelchair operate computer cursor fashion joystick mouse . However , since people ability voluntarily contract ear muscle , question remain best learn contract ear muscle design effective training paradigm . Since norm volunteer voluntary control peri-auricular muscle patient suffer spinal cord injury , thus , investigator go test effectiveness two-step training paradigm among healthy participant explorative stage . In specific , first step training , participant ask voluntarily contract ear muscle facilitation electrical stimulation . At second step training , take part computer game ask move cursor specific target randomly appear computer screen . The cursor control electrical activity produce ear muscle contraction capture surface electromyography ( EMG ) signal . The computer game performance participant second step train surface EMG signal feedback mean surface EMG signal amplitude auricular muscle maximum voluntary contraction baseline , first step training , second step training compare .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>healthy participant ca n't control periauricular muscle begin study ( visible movement ear command ) . Suffering comorbid neuromuscular disease . Having history severe traumatic brain injury . Demonstrating cognitive impairment would prevent provide inform consent follow direction study protocol . Having history migraine headache could exacerbate use electrical stimulation prolong training session . Temporomandibular Joint ( TMJ ) dysfunction could lead unusual discomfort follow training session . Having history prior seizure . Being implanted pacemaker defibrillator .</criteria>
