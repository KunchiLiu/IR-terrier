	<detailed_description>Participants : Participants include 30 adolescent ASD ( 14-18 year age ) . Exclusion criterion consist engage 2 hours/week balance training activity ( i.e. , yoga , tai chi , Wii/Kinect balance game ) study start . Each individual receive pre-training magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Participants randomly assign either treatment group control group . Over next six week , participant treatment group come lab complete 3-5 hours/week video-game motor training . Participants passive control group come lab basic motor measurement sedentary video game without motor training . Participants ask start new exercise-related program 6 week . After sixth week , participant complete post-training MRI scan behavioral assessment . Motor Video Game Training : Participants treatment group come University Wisconsin lab train 3-5 day week research staff supervision . Each training session last 30-60 minute begin end ~5 minute play Ninja Training game Dr. Ellertson 's lab ( Boise State University ) . In game , participant hold position ( i.e. , Karate Kid crane pose ) long , collect time-series data position joint use Kinect camera well time-series data center pressure use Wii balance board . Participants reward hold pose long possible seeing background behind come life . For rest training , participant play balance game Wii Fit . Motor &amp; Symptom Severity Assessments : Pre-post postural stability measure assess group stand posture Wii balance board ( Travers et al. , 2013 ) . Pre-post symptom severity measure include parent-report measure social function , repetitive behaviors/restricted interest , measure daily live skill . Imaging Protocol : Pre- post-training brain imaging complete use 3 Tesla ( ET ) MRI scanner Nova 32-Channel Head Coil . All scan perform &lt; 60 minute . Pulse sequence protocol include advanced diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) NODDI ( Zhang et al. , 2012 ) multicomponent T1 T2 relaxometry use steady state sequence ( mcDESPOT ; Deoni et al. , 2008 ; Alexander et al. , 2011 ) . Structural image anatomical detail morphometric analysis also perform use custom MP2RAGE sequence , inherently remove intensity variation inhomogeneity coil sensitivity .</detailed_description>
