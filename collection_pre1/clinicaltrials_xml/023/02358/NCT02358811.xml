	<brief_summary>Sleep apnea common disease general population particularly elderly subject prevalence reach 30 % 70 year old . In adult ( &lt; 55 year old ) cardiovascular consequence well know make sleep apnea treatment necessary . However elderly ( &gt; 70 year old ) apneic subject less symptomatic term sleepiness , usually present low index respiratory event cardiovascular consequence population still discuss , drive author consider sleep apnea elderly specific disease make need treatment questionable . In study investigator focus comparison adult elderly apneic subject term cognitive cardiovascular consequence . Adult apneic patient suffer decrease cognitive performance well grey matter local atrophy , particularly hippocampus frontal lobe . According few study , white matter also affect demyelinisation process . These structural modification sometimes associate disorder executive memory function . In elderly , clear association drawn cognitive decline sleep apnea . Moreover , knowledge , cerebral state elderly symptomatic apneic subject mostly investigate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Impact Sleep Apnea Cerebral Volumetry According Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal project evaluate impact sleep apnea brain accord age . Our hypothesis adult apneic subject would present local cerebral modification area imply cognition memory , hippocampus frontal area , whereas elderly patient would present focal affect relate deficit ventilatory autonomic control without major cognitive consequence . Understanding consequence sleep apnea accord age could permit refine indication sleep apnea treatment , mainly elderly patient .</detailed_description>
