	<brief_summary>This single-centre , 16-week , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 3-treatment arm pilot study evaluate efficacy safety BTI320 treatment high risk subject pre-diabetes . This pilot study aim test whether take medicine name BTI320 slow carbohydrate absorption gut , low blood sugar . The study aim recruit 60 individual Hong Kong . To take part study , subject must pre-diabetes , , blood sugar level normal reach diabetes range . The medicine BTI320 currently license health supplement Hong Kong know alternatively SUGARDOWN® . The investigator compare effectiveness BTI320 dummy tablet . Both tablet look taste identical study , subject know tablet take . There 4 5 chance receive active medication 1 5 chance receive placebo . Subjects follow closely every 2 4 week period time 22 week . The study visit take 30 minute 3 hour , depend additional check require particular visit include oral glucose tolerance test meal tolerance test . At visit involve meal tolerance test , subject require stay approximately 3 hour . In addition , Visit 2 , Visit 4 3 day Visit 7 , continuous glucose monitor system device instal . Throughout study period , subject return study center check-ups include careful enquiry whether develop side-effects take medication , physical examination , well blood test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BTI320 ( SUGARDOWN® ) Post-Prandial Hyperglycaemia Subjects With Pre-Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent national survey , 11 % adult China diabetes 50 % pre-diabetes define fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) 5.6-6.9 mmol/l and/or 2-hour post glucose ( PG ) 7.8-11.0 mmol/L use 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test ( 75g OGTT ) and/or glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 5.7-6.4 % . Depending presence risk factor , annual conversion rate pre-diabetes average 3-10 % pre-diabetes associate 1.5-2.0 fold increase risk cardiovascular disease . Once diabetes establish , life expectancy reduce 6 year diagnose , treat control , especially young-to-middle aged subject face long disease duration diabetes . In Hong Kong Diabetes Registry , depend control glucose risk factor , 3-10 % Chinese subject diabetes may die develop major event every year include heart disease , stroke , kidney failure /or all-site cancer . Besides glycaemic control define HbA1c , post prandial hyperglycaemia glycaemic variability also show predict cardiovascular renal event pre-diabetic diabetic patient . Genetic variant discover large-scale epidemiological study include China Hong Kong find associate beta cell dysfunction exacerbate glucotoxicity lipotoxicity , often due co-existing obesity give rise early onset diabetes . Several study include Asian population indicate subject pre-diabetes exhibit reduce early phase insulin secretion result postprandial hyperglycaemia impose metabolic stress beta cell lead eventual beta cell failure . BTI320 , also know SUGARDOWN® , derive galactomanan act block key carbohydrate hydrolyze enzyme include amylase , maltose , lactose sucrose gastrointestinal tract . It also act bind ingested polysaccharide slow absorption meal thereby reduce post prandial glucose excursion . The mechanism action BTI320 similar Acarbose® , alpha glucosidase inhibitor , show improve glycaemic control approve prevention diabetes China . 24-hour continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) measure mean blood glucose ( MBG ) , mean area curve blood glucose 10mmol/l ( 180mg/dl ) ( AUC-180 ) , mean postprandial maximum glucose ( MPMG ) , mean amplitude glucose excursion ( MAGE ) 72 hour . These parameter correlate well plasma fructosamine ( FA ) alternatively know glycated albumin , reflect short-term glycaemic control precede 2 week .</detailed_description>
