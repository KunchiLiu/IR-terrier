	<brief_title>The Management Systemic-Pulmonary Collateral Blood Flow Cyanotic Children During Cardiopulmonary Bypass - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A great number study show MAPCAs real issue patient , require far high blood flow previously suggest . However , optimal method CPB still unknown . Recent research Sakamoto et al. , show raise carbon dioxide ( pCO2 ) increase brain blood flow cyanotic patient , suggest noticeable decrease aorto-pulmonary blood shunting . However , mechanism action understand unclear observation associate causative one . Whilst vasoconstrictive ( narrow vessel ) effect hypoxia well document , without high carbon dioxide , report indicate pCO2 alone increase narrow blood vessel lung . We hypothesize rise pCO2 could cause shift blood flow pulmonary systemic circulation , either direct constrict action MAPCA vessel , vasoconstriction blood vessel lung . Furthermore , predict phenomenon could potentially use optimize method treatment , ensure vital organ receive correct amount blood flow surgical correction rare congenital heart disease .</detailed_description>
