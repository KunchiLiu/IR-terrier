	<brief_summary>Patients whose kidney fail generally require dialysis treatment sustain life . The ability patient make major adjustment live dialysis hamper depression affect almost one-quarter individual . There study adequately test whether treatment depression effective dialysis patient difference response two commonly available form treatment , psychotherapy anti-depressant drug therapy . To fill important gap investigator knowledge , investigator propose undertake ( 1 ) randomize control clinical trial 400 patient test whether engagement interview result high proportion dialysis patient accept treatment depression ; ( 2 ) randomize control clinical trial 180 patient determine whether difference likelihood improvement depressive symptom psychotherapy drug therapy among dialysis patient depression . Patients study enrol among individual receive care 50 dialysis facility three metropolitan area - Seattle , Dallas , Albuquerque . The research proposal develop support patient , caregiver , stakeholder ensure finding study relevant readily implement day-to-day clinical practice . Hence , engagement interview psychotherapy deliver dialysis facility ease burden patient , dose study drug change partnership study participant . In addition depressive symptom , effect treatment meaningful outcome fatigue sleep determine . The two form treatment depression test clinical trial different patient differ regard treatment option preferable and/or available . Successful completion clinical trial provide patient , caregiver , stakeholder information would need faced diagnosis depression patient undergoing hemodialysis . This allow patient select evidence-based treatment improve outcome relevant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Sertraline vs. CBT End-stage Renal Disease Patients With Depression { ASCEND }</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Patients end-stage renal disease undergoing maintenance hemodialysis ( HD ) adjust complex treatment regimen , experience frequent care transition . This compound four-fold high prevalence comorbid depression general population , strongly associate poor patient-centered outcome . Yet , depression often diagnosed present , treat identify , many HD patient reluctant accept treatment . This likely result lack high-quality evidence efficacy different treatment option comorbid depression HD patient . OBJECTIVES Conduct open-label , randomize control clinical trial among HD patient comorbid depression ( 1 ) compare efficacy engagement interview usual care increase acceptability treatment ( n=400 ) ; ( 2 ) compare efficacy 12 week cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) anti-depressant drug therapy ( sertraline ) reduce severity depressive symptom , meaningful outcome ( n=180 ) . METHODS HD patient 50 dialysis facility three different region ( Albuquerque , NM ; Dallas , TX ; Seattle , WA ) pre-screened presence clinically significant depressive symptom . Patients confirm diagnosis major depression dysthymia randomly assign engagement interview usual care determine efficacy increase acceptability treatment ( n=400 ) . Individuals agree treatment randomly assign individual CBT drug therapy . CBT administer dialysis facility train therapist . Sertraline titrate maximum tolerate dose use Measurement Based Care , model shared-decision-making . Patient-reported outcome measure single assessor three site , blind treatment assignment . The primary efficacy measure change severity depressive symptom ; secondary outcome measure assess important patient-reported outcome somatic symptom burden , function , adherence dialysis treatment , diet , medication . The longitudinal evolution symptom patient refuse accept treatment either within outside clinical trial also study ( n=90 ) . PATIENT OUTCOMES ( PROJECTED ) This study provide answer three question face HD patient clinically significant depressive symptom : ( 1 ) `` Given preference , I expect happen ? `` ; ( 2 ) `` What option , potential benefit harm option ? `` ; ( 3 ) `` What I improve outcomes important ? '' Oversight study provide separate Patient Council Stakeholder Council align PCORI 's mission generate high-integrity , evidence-based information research guide patient , caregiver , broad health care community .</detailed_description>
