	<brief_summary>The investigator determine efficacy innovative short regimen methenamine hippurate prevention post-operative UTI patient require short-term catheterization pelvic reconstructive surgery single-blind , randomize control trial . Primary outcome rate symptomatic UTI within 3 week catheter removal . The investigator study cost-effectiveness , antibiotic resistance profile , adverse drug effect . Findings may reduce antibiotic use nosocomial UTIs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short-course Methenamine Hippurate Prevention Post-operative UTI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prevention post-operative urinary tract infection ( UTI ) become important individual patient health system . Complications UTI include pyelonephritis bacteremia , require hospitalization parenteral antibiotic . Additionally , recurrent exposure antibiotic commonly give UTIs increase risk antibiotic resistance uropathogens . UTIs also increase economic burden health care system , episode cost nearly 600 dollar . UTIs associated catheterization particularly costly hospital , result decreased hospital quality measure lack compensation . This particularly important pelvic reconstructive surgery , report rate UTI reach 20-25 % . Urinary retention require short-term indwelling catheterization , common woman , contributes risk UTIs increase risk bacteriuria 5-10 % per day dislodge bacterial colony catheter removal . Balancing prevention resistance cost key . A meta-analysis Marschall et al indicated benefit short dose antibiotic prophylaxis catheter removal general post-surgical patient . However , data lack effect daily antibiotic prophylaxis resistance cost . A possible alternative antibiotic present methenamine hippurate , urinary antiseptic form formaldehyde presence acidic urine . It relatively inexpensive , induce resistance vivo . Prior study show daily use methenamine decrease risk post-operative UTI . The purpose study investigate efficacy short course methenamine hippurate catheter removal short course ciprofloxacin prevention UTIs short-term indwelling catheterization . Additionally , investigate factor influence post-operative UTIs , rate culture-proven UTIs prophylaxis , antibiotic resistance profile undergo prophylaxis , cost effectiveness prophylaxis .</detailed_description>
