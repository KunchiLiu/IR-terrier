	<brief_summary>The study assess immunogenicity , safety preliminary clinical efficacy GAA/TT-peptide vaccine poly-ICLC HLA-A2+ child unresectable low-grade glioma receive least two chemotherapy/biologic regimen . Radiation therapy count one biologic regimen , patient may receive radiation index lesion within 1 year enrollment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Vaccine Trial Low Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients treat subcutaneous injection GAA/TT-vaccines start Week 0 every 3 week thereafter 8 cycle Off-treatment criterion meet ( Section 4.6 ) . I.m . poly-ICLC administer ( 30ug/kg i.m . ) immediately follow vaccine . Poly-ICLC administered i.m . within 3 cm peptide-injection site . To allow flexibility scheduling , peptide vaccine Poly-ICLC dose may give within one week date vaccine poly-ICLC administration due . Patients evaluate possible adverse event , regimen limit toxicity ( RLT ) well clinical/radiological response clinical visit MRI scan . Follow-up MRIs perform ( Weeks 6 , 15 24 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Tumor Type Unresectable lowgrade glioma receive least two chemotherapy/biologic regimen . Radiation therapy count biologic regimen . Patients may receive radiation therapy index lesion within 1 year enrollment . Patients may tumor spread within CNS . HLAA2 positive base flow cytometry . Patients must clinically stable lowdose ( 0.1 mg/kg/day , max 4 mg/day Dexamethasone ) corticosteroid least one week prior study registration . Patients must ≥ 12 month &lt; 22 year age time HLAA2 screening . Patients must performance status ≥ 70 ; ( Karnofsky &gt; 16 year Lansky ≤ 16 year age . Documented negative serum betaHCG female patient postmenarchal . Because effect peptidebased vaccine polyICLC fetus sufficiently investigate , pregnant female include study . Patients must free systemic infection require IV antibiotic time registration . Patients must IV antibiotic least 7 day prior registration . Patients adequate organ function measure : Bone marrow : ANC &gt; 1,000/µ ; Platelets &gt; 100,000/µ ( transfusion independent ) ; absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 500/µ ; Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dl ( may transfuse ) . Hepatic : bilirubin &lt; 1.5x institutional normal age ; SGPT ( ALT ) &lt; 3x institutional normal . Renal : Serum creatinine base age Creatinine clearance radioisotope GFR ≥ 70 ml/min/ml/min/1.73 m² Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy grade 1 better . Patients must least 3 week last dose standard cytotoxic chemotherapy myelosuppressive biological therapy least 1 week last dose nonmyelosuppressive biologic therapy . No overt cardiac , gastrointestinal , pulmonary psychiatric disease . Patients live outside North America eligible . Patients may receive radiation index lesion within 1 year enrollment . Concurrent treatment medication ( must least 1 week ) include : Interferon ( e.g . IntronA® ) Allergy desensitization injection Growth factor ( e.g . Procrit® , Aranesp® , Neulasta® ) Interleukins ( e.g . Proleukin® ) Any investigational therapeutic medication Patients must history , currently active autoimmune disorder require cytotoxic immunosuppressive therapy , autoimmune disorder visceral involvement . Use immunosuppressives within four week prior study entry anticipate use immunosuppressive agent . Dexamethasone , corticosteroid medication , use perioperative period must taper 0.1 mg/kg/day , max 4 mg/day dexamethasone least one week study registration . Topical corticosteroid acceptable . Because patient immune deficiency expect respond therapy , HIVpositive patient exclude study . Patients receive prior immunotherapy .</criteria>
