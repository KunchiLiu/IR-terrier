	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Free light chain ( FLC ) removal haemodialysis increase rate renal recovery patient cast nephropathy , severe renal failure de novo multiple myeloma . This study evaluate patient multiple myeloma severe renal failure treat KIDNEY Therapy ( previously call SUPRA HFR ) remove free light chain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Kidney Therapy Free Light Chain Removal Patients With Multiple Myeloma &amp; Cast Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational study perform investigate clinical benefit FLC removal KIDNEY therapy system patient cast nephropathy , dialysis dependent renal failure de novo multiple myeloma . Recruitment commence July 2014 , total 20 patient recruit . Participants treat , KIDNEY therapy system ( Bellco Mirandola , Modena , Italy ) . The KIDNEY system kind haemodiafiltration utilize separate convection , diffusion adsorption . The sorbent cartridge high affinity FLC ( κ λ ) able re-infuse albumin , avoid need albumin perfusion . The KIDNEY therapy undertaken intensive treatment schedule . The primary outcome study independence dialysis 3 month . Secondary outcome : duration dialysis , reduction serum FLC level , myeloma response survival .</detailed_description>
