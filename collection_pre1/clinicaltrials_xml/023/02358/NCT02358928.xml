	<brief_summary>Concurrent rise prevalence childhood obesity , co-morbid condition non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) become leading cause chronic liver disease among child . NAFLD characterize accrual excess triglyceride ( TG ) liver lead inflammation , fibrosis , cirrhosis . One-third pediatric population NAFLD , disease strongly associate insulin-resistance metabolic-syndrome ( Met-S ) . NAFLD predict become leading cause liver transplantation adult 2030 . Current understanding NAFLD indicate presence excess TG liver absolute requirement disease progression . First-line therapy NAFLD focus decrease adiposity improve insulin sensitivity diet exercise . Recent adult data indicate dietary carbohydrate-restriction effective reduce hepatic TG-content traditional calorie-restriction . Few study conduct establish resolution hepatic steatosis intervention . Such study pediatrics primarily limit need liver biopsy . However , hepatic proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( H-MRS ) new innovative tool use quantitatively measure hepatic TG content non-invasive manner . The primary aim compare impact dietary weight loss via carbohydrate-restriction calorie-restriction hepatic TG-content quantified H-MRS obese child biopsy-proven NAFLD Met-S . This IRB approve protocol randomize control study . The investigator recruit subject Center Obesity Consequences Health pediatric gastroenterology clinic age 11-17 year meet criterion NAFLD Met-S. A H-MRS obtain subject prior start dietary intervention . Fifty-four subject randomize either carbohydrate-restricted calorie-restricted diet 6 month change baseline activity . A repeat H-MRS compare baseline determine whether dietary carbohydrate-restriction superior calorie-restriction reduce hepatic TG content . The investigator believe subject carbohydrate-restricted diet marked decrease hepatic TG content compare calorie-restricted diet give degree reduction body mass index .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims Hypothesis : The Primary aim : To compare impact dietary weight loss via carbohydrate-restriction calorie-restriction hepatic TG content quantify H-MRS obese child biopsy-proven NAFLD Met-S. Our Secondary aim : To compare BMI z-score , ALT ( analine transaminase ) cytokeratin 18 obese patient NAFLD Met-S 6 month dietary weight loss via either carbohydrate calorie restriction . Hypothesis : Obese child biopsy-proven NAFLD Met-S experience reduction liver TG content , assess H-MRS , concurrent 6 month dietary weight loss ; however , anticipate subject undergo carbohydrate restriction experience great reduction hepatic fat undergo calorie restriction due limit precursor lipid synthesis inherent diet ( CHO ) expect increase hepatic oxidative metabolism ( TG accrual attenuate disposal enhance ) . Methodology : Design : Our study 6 month prospective randomize control trial outcome assessment monthly first 6 month follow visit 10- 12 month randomization . Setting : Recruitment data collection complete University Texas Southwestern Medical Center Children 's Health , Dallas TX study personnel . All patient agree participate give inform write consent assent . A study staff member explain study review consent HIPAA form patient . A copy sign form keep patient 's study file . Each patient also receive sign copy . Subjects : All patient refer ( male female ) within age range 11 - 17 year obese ( BMI &gt; = 95th percentile ) meet criterion metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) offer participate study . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Age 11 - 17 year 2 . Male Female subject 3 . BMI &gt; = 95th percentile accord CDC body mass index chart age gender 4 . Must willing participate undergo `` willingness change '' evaluation 5 . Metabolic Syndrome ( MetS ) define 3 follow met : 1 . Central adiposity ( waist circumference ≥90th % age sex ) 2 . Hypertriglyceridemia ( triglyceride ≥ 110mg/dl ) 3 . Low HDL cholesterol ≤40mg/dl 4 . Elevated blood pressure systolic diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90th % adjust age , sex height ≥ 130/85 5 . IFG ( Impaired fast glucose ≥ 100mg/dl elevate HOMA‐ IR ≥3.16 ) 6 . ALT great 60 U/L Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease base histologic confirmation liver biopsy ( minimum 5 % hepatocytes macrovesicular fat ) obtain within 6 month randomization Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Those patient history poor compliance adherence energy restriction diet 2 . Patients medication could alter appetite include glucocorticoid , psychostimulants ( Vyvanse , Adderall ) , psychotropic medication ( Zoloft , Risperdal ) , antihyperglycemic medication ( metformin , sulfonylurea ) 3 . Patients follow illness : 1 . Type 2 diabetes 2 . Renal disease 3 . Mental disease ( mood , psychotic anxiety disorder ) 4 . Developmental delay 5 . Autism autism spectrum disorder 6 . Any liver disease except non alcoholic fatty liver ( NAFLD ) 7 . Metabolic disorder ( tyrosinemia , glycogen storage disease , lysosomal disorder ) 8 . Congenital heart disease 9 . Myopathies muscular disorders/disability 4 . Patients follow ( cultural religious ) vegetarian lifestyle would compatible Carbohydrate Restriction ( need high quality protein ) 5 . Prepubertal patient define tan stage 1 6 . Current history significant alcohol consumption Concise Summary Project : This 6-month prospective , randomize control trial enrol patient refer Children 's Medical Center COACH Program . The COACH Program medical weight management clinic , serve obese child order diagnose treat associate co-morbid condition . Subjects meet enrollment criterion randomize either carbohydrate- calorie-restricted diet . They commit fix meal plan 6 month dietary education certify dietician provide . This include allow caloric intake content , calculate bioelectric impedance meter ( GE In Body 520 ) specific patient 's age , gender , weight . The carbohydrate-restricted diet compose 20 % carbohydrate , 35 % protein 45 % fat . The calorie-restricted diet compose 50 % carbohydrate , 15-20 % protein 30-35 % fat . Patients see psychologist help goal setting , self-monitoring problem solving . Dietary compliance follow regularly weekly phone call first 3 month monthly afterwards research personnel . A 72-hour dietary recall conduct dietician every month . Subjects followed COACH clinic monthly . A detailed schedule outline provided family visit . Any missed appointment reschedule within 3 7 day , family contact immediately offer assistance next visit . During study , subject monitor urine test blood test ensure safety undergo prescribed diet . The first proton hepatic magnetic spectroscopy ( H-MRS ) do prior initiate dietary intervention . A second H-MRS obtain 2 month ( visit 3 ) assign dietary therapy . The final H-MRS perform completion 6 month dietary intervention . At 6 month completion , subject see clinic blood work urine test do . Their final visit 4 6 month post dietary intervention ass weight maintenance .</detailed_description>
