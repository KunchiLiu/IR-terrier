	<brief_title>Chronic Urticaria - Long Term Assessment Effects Rupatadine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment CSU nsAHs currently common license therapeutic option reduce patient ' wheal flare type skin reaction pruritus . CSU highly fluctuate disease severity symptom change markedly day day . This one reason , routine daily practice , many patient tend perform demand rather continuous , daily , preventive treatment symptom nsAHs . While field allergic rhinitis several study point towards well efficacy nsAHs continuously give ( 6-8 ) , study CSU compare treatment approach publish Grob colleague ( 9 ) . They able demonstrate continuous daily treatment nsAH desloratadine result significantly good quality life compare demand therapy . While study indicate treatment schedule generally major impact outcome treatment , result efficacy demand nsAHs CSU remain confirm independently . In addition optimal treatment schedule , ongoing discussion regard long-term outcome nsAH treatment . While mode action nsAHs suggest pure symptomatic therapeutic effect , speculation disease modification effect might also occur . Indeed , 2010 , Japanese group ( Kono et al . ) present data EADV meeting Gothenburg demonstrate continuous prophylactic antihistamine therapy CSU patient ebastine ( nsAH ) period three month associate low recurrence rate discontinuation treatment last one month , provide drug effective safe early treatment . As yet , result also confirm independently . Sufficient reduction urticarial symptom require high licensed dose antihistamine many CSU patient ( 10-14 ) . In fact , increase dose nsAHs fourfold show effective compare standard dose different subforms chronic urticaria ( 10 , 11 , 14 ) . However , patient even high dose nsAHs enough effectively suppress disease symptom ( 11-14 ) . The exact reason still unknown . Probably , mediator histamine also involve development urticaria symptom . One candidate mediator platelet activate factor ( PAF ) . PAF potent phospholipid mediator various biological activity , include platelet aggregation , airway constriction , hypotension , vascular permeation . PAF also mediate allergic reaction claim contribute pathogenesis urticaria . Intradermal PAF injection result pruritic wheal flare reaction subject without allergy ( 15 ) . PAF injection follow dose-dependent histamine release vivo ( 16 ) cold contact urticaria , evidence available PAF additional important mediator associate inflammatory reaction skin ( 17 , 18 ) . Notably , Krause et al . could demonstrate intradermal PAF injection result wheal flare type skin reaction without induce mast cell degranulation ( 19 ) . PAF may , therefore , relevant mediator pathogenesis urticaria act downstream mast cell activation independent H1-receptor activation . Rupatadine , drug posse potent antihistamine PAF antagonistic activity , recently , demonstrate safe effective treatment chronic urticaria ( 3 , 4 ) cold contact urticaria ( 5 ) . Notably , also show increase dose 20 mg rupatadine effective treatment CSU symptom compare license 10 mg dose ( 20 ) . In summary , seem reasonable use rupatadine study drug patient CSU order well characterize best nsAH treatment schedule ( continuous vs. on-demand ) , long-term outcome nsAH therapy influence updosing latter .</detailed_description>
