	<criteria>Patients diagnose suspected NET require 111Inpentetreotide image clinical indication . High risk NET familial predisposition clinical finding require radiolabeled somatostatin imaging . Other somatostatin positive tumor 111Inpentetreotide use successfully ( example adult meningioma ) . Ability subject Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) ( patient deem treat physician cognitively impaired questionably impaired way ability patient give inform consent questionable ) understand willingness sign write informed consent . Pregnant lactating woman : Pregnant woman exclude study effect 68GaDOTATOC pregnancy know ; exception may perform expect risk outweigh benefit . Pregnancy test follow MITS procedure diagnostic reagent . Patients self report pregnancy status . If pregnant test perform unless clinical opinion attend physician gain test likely outweigh risk ( rare ) . If unsure whether pregnant urine serum pregnancy perform . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary administration 68GaDOTATOC mother , breastfeed discontinue least one day mother receive 68GaDOTATOC . Patients contraindication 111Inpentetreotide . Known severe allergy hypersensitivity oral contrast preclude administration contrast ( preclude receive oral contrast ) . Patients body weight 400 pound able enter bore PET/CT scanner due BMI , compromise image quality CT , PET/CT MRI result . Any additional medical condition , serious intercurrent illness , extenuate circumstance , opinion Investigator , may significantly interfere study compliance .</criteria>
