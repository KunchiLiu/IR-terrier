	<brief_title>Effect Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Associated With Aerobic Exercise Training Patients With Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The average analyzed value 1.20 , standard deviation 0.84 , take account type I error 5 % , type II error 10 % power 80 % . From sample calculation find n = 10 group . The sample amplify order avoid possible effect dropout end n = 15 group total N = 45 . Randomization perform blinded therapist use sealed envelope individual . The subject divide three intervention group : tDCS ( tDCS - DC stimulator , Neurocom , Germany ) / AE Group , receive active intervention aerobic exercise training active tDCS intervention . AE group , receive active intervention aerobic exercise placebo tDCS . And tDCS group , receive placebo AE active intervention tDCS . Participants blind intervention group well therapist involve evaluation process . The evaluation method carry one week begin intervention ( baseline ) variable . After first week intervention ( neuromodulatory period ) perform rating level cortical excitability ( T1 ) , end one month period intervention variable ( T2 ) . Follow-up evaluation conduct one month ( T3 ) two month ( T4 ) end intervention period . ''</detailed_description>
