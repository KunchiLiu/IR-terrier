	<brief_summary>The 5 year survival patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer le 5 % . Since introduction gemcitabine , advance therapy advanced/metastatic set extremely slow . Numerous phase III study evaluate different gemcitabine-based regimen first-line therapy , case , observe benefit small restrict patient good performance status ( PS ) . Recently two new chemotherapy combination schedule , FOLFIRINOX Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel demonstrate significant survival improvement compare gemcitabine alone . Nab-paclitaxel especially interest able break-down tumor matrix increase concentration cytotoxic drug tumor . Our study explore modification desmoplastic reaction see pancreatic cancer use two approach , target tumor stroma nab-paclitaxel hedgehog inhibitor LDE225 target tumor cell gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study LDE225 With Gemcitabine Nab-paclitaxel Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growing body evidence suggest stroma mechanical barrier may prevent efficient delivery various anticancer therapy tumor , also constitute dynamic compartment pancreatic tumor critically involved tumor formation , progression metastasis . Thus , target tumor stroma cancer cell could lucrative strategy increase efficacy therapeutic approach . In present study want explore safety activity chemotherapy combination : Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel + LDE225 . LDE225 hedgehog inhibitor promise antitumor activity several cancer model , include pancreatic cancer . One main activity also degradation tumor matrix . Patients locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer treat fixed dos gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel , dos use recently present phase III study ( von Hoff American Society Clinical Oncology ASCO 2013 ) . In phase I part study LDE225 add accord standard dose escalation strategy phase I study , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) patient treat phase II part study .</detailed_description>
