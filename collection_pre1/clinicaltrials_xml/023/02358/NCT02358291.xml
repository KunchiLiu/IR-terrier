	<brief_title>Microendoscopic Discectomy Vs Transforaminal Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy Vs Open Discectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lumbar disc herniation ( LDH ) one common diseases department orthopedics , produce medical economic burden family society . In spite , majority patient disc herniation relieve even cured via conservative treatment ; still considerable number invalid patient eventually still need undergoing surgical operation treatment . Three main method intervertebral disc surgery adopt routine work . One procedure Open Discectomy ( OD ) , always gold standard treatment LDH . And two procedure Microendoscopic Discectomy ( MED ) Transforaminal Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy ( TELD ) respectively . MED TELD develop alternative OD . OD compress nerve root spinal cord removal protrusion . However , destroys rear structure spine , cause segmental instability long-term distress . Compared OD , MED TELD procedures small incision less dissection ( ) , low blood loss , less postoperative pain , short hospitalisation earlier return work . However , steep learn curve MID inhibit development surgery specialist ; example , optimal surgical management require many year experience . These deficiency need educational effort high priority accord far . There inconsistent outcome efficacy safety previous study ; recent research yield conclusive result .</detailed_description>
