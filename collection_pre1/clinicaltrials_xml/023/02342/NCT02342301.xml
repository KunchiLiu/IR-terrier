	<brief_title>Cardiometabolic Response Sit-stand Workstations .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study include 24 male female participant 18 year age old work office-based setting . To included participant must abdominally obese , defined waist circumference ≥ 88 cm woman , 102 cm men . All potential participant ask come Human Performance Laboratory University Prince Edward Island give opportunity ask question study , read sign inform consent form . Once take place , participant waist circumference measure order determine whether meet criterion . If , individual thank time tell eligible participate current study . Lab Day 1 ( baseline ) Once screen complete , participant glycosylated hemoglobin check via simple finger prick point-of-care analysis single drop blood . ( Funding dependent , second drop blood may use analyze participant 's blood lipid profile- would do typical doctor 's office visit ) . Next measure participant ' rest metabolic rate , lay hospital bed analyze oxygen carbon dioxide concentration air exhale . This inform u participant 's baseline caloric need . Blood pressure , height , weight , waist circumference body composition determine follow rest metabolic rate , prior determination aerobic fitness use sub-maximal exercise protocol ( see ) . Augmentation Index : Arterial stiffness determine use Sphygmocor pulse wave applanation tonomoter ( Atcor Medical ) . This device measure arterial pulse wave non-invasively skin wrist . We use device analyze shape pulse wave , give u information reflect pulse wave ( thus stiffness arterial tree ) . The measure arterial stiffness non-invasive pain-free take use pen-like tool press participant 's skin detect pulse . Prior depart lab , participant instruct use accelerometer-based activity monitor ( 20 min ) , wear 1 week prior desk intervention . During activity monitor collection week , participant also instruct wear heart rate belt ( non-invasive chest strap ) one day work hour ( least 4 hour data collection ) analyze strap return lab . Participants answer online questionnaire his/her current physical activity sedentary behavior . http : //docs.google.com/forms/d/1fjz5ua47KzcdnhCAN7wCDGNbvy-tKSGgZKGGhIKSqQg/viewform ? usp=mail_form_link . A similar questionnaire use post- intervention follow-up tense change question `` anticipated '' desk use alter report `` actual '' use ( participant control group ask answer `` applicable '' question related stand desk use follow-up questionnaire ) . Total participation Time ( 1.5 hr ) Once baseline test session complete , participant randomly allocate intervention control group ( 12 participant per group ) . Participants intervention group ask complete intervention , control group ask maintain current lifestyle office workstation throughout study . Intervention- participant give stand-up desk ask use place normal desk work . Participants give activity HR monitor wear first last 2 week desk use . Lab day 2 ( post ) - measure lab day 1 repeat described . Aerobic Fitness- Aerobic fitness determine use treadmill-based graded exercise test analysis expire gas . The test consist 2-3 increasingly challenge stage walking/running ( addition speed incline ) submaximal intensity . The heart rate oxygen consumption data collect used extrapolate data estimate maximal value . All aerobic fitness test administer supervision Canadian Society Exercise Physiology Certified Exercise Physiologist . Prior exercise participant require complete Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire ( PAR-Q+ ) safe exercise participation screen form know suspected chronic disease risk factor ( tool use screening purpose ) . Resting metabolic rate determine use electrochemical analyzer ( metabolic cart ) exercise measure , except different flowmeter gas collection system use ( namely , use canopy rather face mask ) . This allow participant relax rest normally without need nose mouth cover rubber mask , entire head shoulder contain within canopy collect gas . This system identical use in-hospital .</detailed_description>
