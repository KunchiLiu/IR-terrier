	<brief_title>F901318 Multiple Ascending Dose Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Double blind , placebo control , ascend single multiple intravenous dose , sequential group study . This study two part . In first part , twenty four subject complete study 3 cohort ( Groups A C ) , group consist 8 subject , six receive active compound two receive placebo eight day . Each subject study approximately 7 week . Each subject participate one treatment cohort , reside Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) Day -1 ( day dose ) Day 13 ( 120 hour post last dose ) . This first part ( Part 1 ) test dos already evaluate previous single ascend dose study ( F901318-01-01-14 , 0.25-4 mg/kg give 4 hour ) . The dose level study expect 1.5 , 3 4 mg/kg/day give four hour infusion daily . In second part study ( Part 2 ) , dose high previously evaluate may study and/or different dose schedule design deliver maximum tolerate dose 24 hour . If dose level higher previously study chosen , optional single dose study initially safety pharmacokinetic profile ( Part 2A ) , follow 14 day later another group subject exposure dose level 8 consecutive day ( Part 2B ) . These high dos may give twice daily dose schedule . Six subject receive active compound two receive placebo single dose multiple dose cohort . The single dose cohort receive study drug sentinel group design two subject receive study drug ( one active one placebo ) first day rest group one day later . There review safety data Principal Investigator Medical Monitor first two subject dose last six subject dose cohort part 2A . In Part 2 , forty-eight subject complete study 6 cohort ( Part 2A , Groups D1 F1 , single day dosing , Part 2B , Groups D2 F2 eight day ' dosing ) . Subjects Parts 1 2B study approximately 7 week Part 2A approximately 8 week . Each subject participate one treatment cohort , reside Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) Day -1 ( day dose ) Day 6 ( 120 hour single dose Parts 1 2A ) Day -1 ( day dose ) Day 13 ( 120 hour first dose Part 2B ) . The proposed total daily dose level Part 2 10 mg/kg/day give either daily two split daily dos . The duration infusion 2 24 hour may include load dose achieve therapeutic plasma concentration quickly possible . All subject return post-study visit 8 10 day last dose study medication .</detailed_description>
