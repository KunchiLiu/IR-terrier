	<brief_title>Evaluation Lung Clearance Index</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It mandatory detect early possible lung CF disease young child CF initiate active therapy limit irreversible lesion . Lung Clearance Index ( LCI ) evaluate gas clearance alveolar volume easy to-do technique pre-school child . Main objective To evaluate correlation LCI thoracic low dose compute tomodensitometry ( CT ) endpoints initial visit Secondary objectives 1 . To evaluate correlation LCI respiratory function measurement visit 2 . To evaluate correlation evolution LCI respiratory function endpoint evolution CT child thoracic low dose CT request referent doctor two year . 3 . To evaluate LCI predictive value respiratory function 2 year later preschool child . This prospective multicenter cohort study . Study visit perform year annual check normal follow child . Initial visit ( Visit 1 ) take place annual check-up low dose CT prescribed . It include follow test : LCI , Lung function test ( LFTs ) perform accord age ( force volume flow , plethysmographic specific airway resistance interrupter resistance ) , low dose CT scan perform accord standardize protocol . Visit 2 perform 12 ± 3 month later include follow test : LCI , LFTs . Visit 3 perform 24 ± 3 month later include follow test : LCI , LFTs , judge necessary child 's referent doctor , low dose CT scan perform accord standardize protocol . Anthropometric data , infection history , treatment collect visit . Recruiting period : 1 year Study period : 2 year per patient , 3 year whole LCI help evaluate early ventilation inhomogeneity due small bronchus abnormality young child CF . Concordance LCI CT endpoints evaluation help define frequency lung CT administration young CF child . Predictive value later abnormal lung function development evaluate . This help detect child risk develop abnormal lung function target require active treatment . Finally endpoint valuable future therapeutic trial CFTR correctors potentiators .</detailed_description>
