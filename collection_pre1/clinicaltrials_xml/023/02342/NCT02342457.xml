	<detailed_description>Hirschsprungs disease find 1:5000 newborn , disease cause aganglionosis colon , lead severe constipation possible bowel obstruction . The diagnosis base leveling biopsy take rectum colon . Treatment supportive complication arise , surgical definitive correction pathophysiological condition cause disease . Currently , clinicians rely histopathology , diagnose disease , plan surgical correction . The main goal Surgical treatment creation continuous patent innervate bowel , effective propulsive peristalsis take place . This achieved resection aganglionic colon , anastomosis normal colon normal ganglion , anus . Today surgeon await histopathology report diagnosis Hirschsprungs disease , frozen section biopsy take surgery ascertain level ganglionated bowel . In study investigator aim correlate electrophysiological reading , colon suspect Hirschsprungs disease . If correlation find , specific pattern diagnostic disease may find , electrophysiological study may offer new way diagnose disease , invasive allows prompt diagnosis contrast histopathology time consume . A reliable electrophysiological study Hirschsprungs disease may helpful early correct diagnosis , noninvasive procedure compare biopsy colonic wall . Children chronic constipation , suspect hirschsprung disease , admit rectal biopsy include study . During procedure , electrophysiological reading site choose biopsy do . Correlation electrophysiological data histopathology analyze . The actual reading carry custom make electrode GAELTEC DEVICES LTD : DUNVEGAN : ISLE OF SKYE : SCOTLAND .</detailed_description>
