One popular nutritional supplement use treat allergy allergic rhinitis , allergic sinusitis , inhalant allergen , environmental allergen Methylsulfonylmethane [ 4 ] . Methylsulfonylmethane ( MSM ) , also know dimethyl sulfone methyl sulfone , organic compound contain sulfur occurs naturally variety fruit , vegetable , grain , animal , include human [ 5 ] . It also use treat arthritis pain , musculoskeletal pain , parasitic infection , rosacea , stretch mark , alopecia among others [ 4 ] . The use MSM find effective reducing symptom seasonal allergic rhinitis ( SAR ) .

MSM rapidly absorb , well distribute , completely dispose body 120 hour initial administration [ 9 ] . This randomized , double-blind , adaptive design study aim prove Methylsulfonylmethane study product improve nasal breathe `` stuffy nose '' symptom exposure environmental allergen . Endpoints include percent change Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow , VAS Nasal Symptom Score , number sneeze number use tissue response allergen exposure .</detailed_description>
