	<detailed_description>The incidence hepatobiliary disease cystic fibrosis first 10 year life 2.5 1.8 / 100 patient-years , significantly decrease second decade ; generally 30-40 % child develop hepatic disease 12 year . However , hepatobiliary damage varies clinical histological expression . The typical histological appearance liver focal biliary cirrhosis ( fibrosis ) characterize heterogeneous distribution portal fibrosis liver . Complications cirrhosis responsible 2.5 % deaths patient cystic fibrosis represent second cause death lung disease exclude death secondary lung transplantation . The diagnosis hepatic disease early stage development assessment progression fibrosis difficult absence sensitive specific non-invasive diagnostic test . Non-invasive assessment hepatic fibrosis important topic study recent year , emergence biological method quantitative elastography method use ultrasound Magnetic Resonance Imagery ( MRI ) allow quantification hepatic elasticity , assume reflection fibrosis . The advantage method numerous : - The assessment wider hepatic parenchyma hepatic biopsy , allow overcome sample bias - Painless non-invasive method patient - Simple make - Do require hospitalization perform outpatient - Immediately know result - Can repeat often necessary patient 's follow-up - Lower cost , morbidity mortality compare hepatic biopsy . Several non-invasive method fibrosis diagnosis study adult primarily viral disease help limit indication hepatic biopsy . However , method validate early diagnosis hepatic disease monitoring child cystic fibrosis . The main objective study assess contribution FibroTest , ultrasound impulse elastography , Fibroscan ( FS ) , ultrasound elastography ShearWave ( SWE ) Magnetic Resonance Elastography ( MRE ) diagnosis hepatic fibrosis cystic fibrosis . The secondary objective follow : - To study correlation fibrosis quantitative result obtain four technique measurement match result four technique use standard available t0 year ( t1 ) . - Study correlation clinical , biological ultrasound endpoint hepatic disease various non-invasive measurement method fibrosis . - Evaluate area ROC curve different test diagnostic performance test use analytical method without gold standard classify child two group : presence advance fibrosis ( stage F2 F4 ) ( F0 F1 stage ) , contract committee accord result biopsy , clinical , laboratory ultrasound endpoint independent test .</detailed_description>
