	<brief_summary>Postoperative Cognitive Disorders ( POCD ) common hospitalize people &gt; 60 year old , especially orthopedic patient . Etiology POCD complex , aspect still remain unclear . The role thromboembolic event etiology POCD discuss . The incidence event patient underwent big joint arthroplasty high 40 60 % , although case subclinical . Thromboembolic material block blood flow vessel brain . As consequence cerebral neuron damage destroyed . After neuronal damage specific substance , S100B protein , glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) neuron-specific enolase ( NSE ) release blood . The serum concentration biomarkers measure . Moreover , block blood flow decrease regional cerebral saturation affect part brain . In project author would like analyze correlation regional cerebral saturation serum concentration S100B protein GFAP orthopedic patient schedule primary hip arthroplasty .</brief_summary>
