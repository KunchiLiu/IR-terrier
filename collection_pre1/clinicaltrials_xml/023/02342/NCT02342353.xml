	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm metastatic unresectable locally advanced NSCLC know sensitive EGFR mutation . Patients mutation T790M eligible progress treatment third generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( osimertinib ) , otherwise patient must EGFR T790M negative unknown status . Patients previously treat third generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor must achieve treatment benefit least 4 month . Disease progression follow therapy erlotinib , afatinib , gefitinib May receive one prior treatment chemotherapy Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 10 mm CT scan , ≥ 20 mm chest xray , ≥ 10 mm caliper clinical exam . At least 18 year age . ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Normal bone marrow organ function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x IULN AST ( SGOT ) / ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 x IULN ; liver metastasis , ≤ 5.0 x IULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Adequate cardiac function demonstrate LVEF ≥ 50 % perform 4 week prior enrollment . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Able swallow pill Able understand willing sign Human Research Protection Office ( HRPO ) approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . Known preexist interstitial lung disease . Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis untreated symptomatic central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis . Patients asymptomatic CNS metastasis , leptomeningeal disease , eligible provide clinically stable without require increase steroid dose least 4 week . A history malignancy ≤ 5 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . Received chemotherapeutic target agent ( approved investigational ) NSCLC within 2 week initiation pacritinib ( exception erlotinib ) . Currently receive investigational agent . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition pacritinib agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding : Patient must negative pregnancy test within 14 day study entry . Known HIVpositivity combination antiretroviral therapy potential pharmacokinetic interaction pacritinib . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Use potent cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) inducer within one week pacritinib initiation Patients CTCAE grade 2 cardiac arrhythmia may consider inclusion arrhythmia stable , asymptomatic , unlikely affect patient safety . Patients exclude ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias CTCAE grade ≥ 3 , correct QT interval ( QTc ) prolongation &gt; 450ms , factor increase risk QT interval prolongation ( eg , heart failure , hypokalemia [ define serum potassium &lt; 3.0mEq/L persistent refractory correction ] , family history long QT interval syndrome ) . Any gastrointestinal ( GI ) metabolic condition could interfere absorption oral medication ongoing grade 3 high diarrhea , constipation , nausea , vomit . Active viral hepatitis .</criteria>
