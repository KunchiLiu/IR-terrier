	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS Kidney transplantation ( KT ) optimal treatment end-stage kidney disease ( ESKD ) . It reduce mortality , improve quality life , less costly dialysis . Further , live donor KT ( LDKT ) well decease donor KT ( DDKT ) : ( ) patient identify live donor get KT much quickly one await DDKT , ( b ) LDKT yield well outcomes DDKT improve cost effectiveness , reduce morbidity , increase long-term survival . The KT evaluation process , occur patient refer KT , lengthy , time consuming , burdensome patient . It require patient complete numerous test ( e.g. , blood work , cardiac check , pap smear , etc . ) order present transplant team accept KT . Although variation center exists , typically patient must complete testing , ensure clinical provider forward result transplant team . This require significant oversight follow-up patient clinical provider . The investigator ' previous ongoing NIDDK-funded research indicate cultural factor ( i.e. , perceive discrimination health care , religious objection LDKT ) , KT knowledge , demographic characteristic ( e.g. , age , education , income ) independently significantly predict time complete KT evaluation . Similarly , investigator ' research find African Americans ( AA ) take significantly long complete evaluation process , factor identify predict long time complete evaluation significantly associate race . Other research show significant disparity ESKD treatment member vulnerable group ( e.g. , Hispanic/Latino , Native Americans , low income ) , African Americans ( AA ) particularly vulnerable group . For example , although ESKD AA four time great white ( WH ) , AA le half likely undergo KT . AA race associate : ( ) long time complete evaluation KT,19 ( b ) low likelihood get KT , ( c ) low rate pre-emptive listing KT , , ( ) low rate LDKT versus DDKT . Therefore , two best way reduce disparity KT may increase ( ) number vulnerable group member complete KT evaluation ( b ) rate LDKT . This study two-pronged approach address two critical area . In December 2012 investigator ' transplant center implement one-day streamlined evaluation process , dub Kidney Transplant Fast Track ( KTFT ) , evaluate efficacy cost effectiveness . Thus , investigator propose quasi-experiment determine efficacy cost-effectiveness vulnerable group KTFT compare historical control recruit previous NIDDK study . This component study allow investigator take advantage unique unusual natural experiment occur due system-level clinical change way patient evaluate KT center . The investigator test KTFT yield faster evaluation completion time , ultimately high KT rate . The second component study conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) target KTFT patient educational component TALK intervention increase LDKT . The KT evaluation period pose excellent opportunity encourage patient pursue LDKT . However , evaluation period compress via program KTFT , become critical maximize patient ' ability pursue LDKT . For quasi-experimental RCT component work , investigator target vulnerable population risk extend evaluation time low rate LDKT two critical factor lead disparity KT . Specifically , investigator intend : SA1 : Test efficacy cost-effectiveness comprehensive , system-level fast-track KT evaluation vulnerable group reduce time complete KT evaluation , increase KT rate . H1a : Compared historical control , evaluation time reduce KTFT evaluation . H1b : Compared historical control , KTFT increase KT rate . H1c : KTFT cost-effective evaluation strategy relative standard evaluation practice . SA2 : Using RCT , test effectiveness TALK intervention increase rate LDKT KTFT . H2a : Compared no-TALK control , rate LDKT high TALK group . H2b : Participants KTFT+TALK high KT rate historical control no-TALK control . H2c : The addition KTFT+TALK cost-effective strategy increase LDKT rate . SA3 : Determine whether engage comprehensive , streamline , coordinated-care evaluation experience within transplant center reduces negative perception healthcare system . H3a : After KTFT , participant report low level medical mistrust KTFT , low historical control . H3b : After KTFT , AA participant report low level perceive discrimination racism KTFT , low historical control . RESEARCH STRATEGY SIGNIFICANCE The incidence prevalence end-stage kidney disease ( ESKD ) case US nearly doubled 1990s . In US population , 590,000 adult currently treat ESKD , another 7.4 million chronic kidney disease , typically advance ESKD . The age baby boomer , change racial distribution , increase prevalence diabetes US indicate prevalence ESKD continue rise . In 2010 , US spend $ 27 billion Medicare fund treat patient ESKD . Medicare cost per person per year range $ 32,914 KT patient , $ 66,751 peritoneal dialysis , $ 87,561 hemodialysis . This amount include money pay private health insurer well source public health coverage VA state fund Medicaid . Although 90 % cost go toward dialysis treatment popular modality ESKD treatment , kidney transplantation ( KT ) optimal treatment end-stage kidney disease ( ESKD ) . It reduce mortality , improve quality life , less costly dialysis . Patients get KT start dialysis , fare well post-transplant transplanted start dialysis . Further , live donor KT ( LDKT ) well decease donor KT ( DDKT ) : ( ) patient identify live donor ( LD ) get KT much quickly one await DDKT7 , , ( b ) LDKT yield well outcomes DDKT improve cost effectiveness , reduce morbidity , increase long-term survival . Research show significant disparity ESKD member vulnerable group ( e.g. , Hispanic/Latino , Native Americans , low income ) , African Americans ( AA ) particularly vulnerable group . The AA population disproportionately represent among patient ESKD . Although AAs represent 13 % US population , represent 30 % ESKD . Since late 1970s incidence ESKD increase fourfold rate among AA compare white ( WH ) . Kidney disease particularly problematic major cause diabetes hypertension , two disease prevalent among AA related combination physiological , lifestyle , behavioral , socioeconomic , healthcare access difference AA WH . AA race associate : ( ) low likelihood referral KT among dialysis patient , ( b ) long time complete evaluation KT , ( c ) low likelihood get KT , ( ) low rate pre-emptive listing KT , ( e ) low rate LDKT versus DDKT . Therefore , two best way reduce disparity KT may increase ( ) number vulnerable group member complete KT evaluation ( b ) rate LDKT . Our study two-pronged approach address two critical area lead disparity .</detailed_description>
