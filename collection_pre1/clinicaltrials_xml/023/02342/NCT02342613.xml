	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 clinical study design examine safety feasibility use anti-CD3/CD28 activated marrow infiltrate lymphocyte ( MILs ) treatment relapse allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( alloHCT ) patient hematologic malignancy bone marrow involvement relapse disease . These MILs derive bone marrow relapse patient previously receive post-transplantation cyclophosphamide ( PTCy ) graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) prophylaxis ( PTCy-MILs ) . A bone marrow aspiration perform patient collect ~200ml marrow ex vivo expansion . During expansion process , T cell activate expanded co-stimulation anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody covalently attach super-paramagnetic microbeads . Patients treated salvage therapy ex vivo expansion ongoing . After simultaneous salvage therapy ex vivo expansion , activate PTCy-MILs reinfused . Patients monitor primary objective feasibility expand target dose level activate PTCy-MILs cause grade III-IV acute GVHD within first 90 day PTCy-MIL infusion .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥18 year old Bone marrow relapse hematologic malignancy ≥6 month alloHCT use PTCy Donor CD3+ chimerism ≥ 30 % measured peripheral blood bone marrow ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Karnofsky performance scale ≥ 70 % . Off immunosuppressive drug 2 week prior PTCyMILs collection . Expectation ability safely undergo salvage treatment appropriate patient 's malignant disease type determine treat hematologist/ oncologist . Most recent alloHCT utilize PTCy . Active GVHD require treatment . Immunosuppression use within 28 day PTCyMIL infusion prior grade IIIV acute GVHD . Creatinine ≥ 2.5 , total bilirubin &gt; 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , AST/ALT &gt; 3 time ULN . HIV1/2 HTLV1/2 positivity . Life expectancy ≤ 90 day even aggressive treatment , determine treat hematologist/oncologist , would preclude assessment toxicity PTCyMILs</criteria>
