	<brief_summary>Periventricular Leukomalacia ( PVL ) white matter lesion surround lateral ventricle brain occur prenatal period , associate disorder movement posture , know bilateral cerebral palsy . Children PVL bilateral cerebral palsy spar verbal ability , measure verbal Intelligence Quotient ( verbal IQ ) test , non-verbal intelligence especially visuo-perceptual visuo-spatial ability impair . In addition study underline impact PVL also executive function , especially term work memory ability inhibit distraction . Working Memory ability retain manipulate information brief period time . It important several complex cognitive function , academic learn plan organize daily life activity . School-based activity , indeed , math read depend student 's ability pay attention several instruction information hold integrate mind . Recent behavioural neurofunctional study describe effect evidence-based computer-based training work memory , Cogmed Working MemoryTraining . Functional MRI show increase parietal prefrontal activity training , behavioural data demonstrate generalization effect also cognitive function directly train , attention , inhibition , learn non-verbal reasoning . Cogmed Working MemoryTraining ( RoboMemo® , CogMed-Cognitive Medical Systems , Stockholm , Sweden ) online treatment comprise number visuo-spatial verbal exercise vary automatically depend individual child 's performance give task . The training period intensive include 25 home session five week , 30-45 minute day . A Cogmed-trained coach monitor train progress participant ' commitment daily . Only one ongoing study use CogMed train child cerebral palsy , without investigate correlation behavioural finding neurofunctional data . The aim study analyze effect work memory training CogMed train directly train cognitive ability change cortical electrophysiological reorganization sleep training . The sleep analysis focus particular slow wave activity [ frequency range 1-4.5 Hz ] sleep spindle [ frequency range 12-14Hz ] , reflect depth sleep related memory process , learn brain plasticity . The result project shed light mechanism neuroplasticity , enhance knowledge neuropsychological effect specific work memory train neurophysiological underpinnings behavioural effect clinical population child congenital brain lesion , PVL .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The procedure implement register patient data include following step : - The quality assurance plan provide : - verify clinical field , necessary include select patient , available registry ( e.g . type cerebral palsy ; MRI documentation , age ) ; - monitor patient ' contact information available well test material software ; - set team meeting uniform recruitment procedure , data collection registration . - Data check conduct two research team ; - Source data verification : paper electronic case report form use mutually check . - Data dictionary : Pre-post measure choose team describe report form together reference normative data . - Procedure Standardization address registry operation : Researches co-work patient recruitment attribute identification number patient enrol accord inclusion exclusion criterion evaluate neuropsychiatric team describe . All researcher train register data internal database note presence adverse event . The researcher provide training assure comprehension subscription write consent . Consent form discuss team order provide explicit clear instruction train protocol parent patient . - Calculation sample size : Sample size , specify number participant necessary demonstrate training effect , calculate training effect size Start index Max index provide CogMed training . Based previous pilot study institute ( effect size =.54 ) finding Lundqvist collaborator ( 2010 ) ( effect size=.95 ) , effect size estimate study .60 sample size 20 child . - Design : A stepped randomized clinical trial design choose split participant two group , match age sex , order control test-retest effect . Both group receive neuropsychological electrophysiological assessment initial time point ( T1 ) . One group ( Cluster B ) start Cogmed training home immediately T1 , second group ( Cluster A ) start train following time point ( T2 ) . When training complete , group retested neuropsychological electrophysiological assessment ( T2 ) . After time point , Cluster A start Cogmed training re-tested neuropsychological electrophysiological assessment finally time point ( T3 ) . - The following time point provide : Initial time point ( T1 ) correspond pre-training assessment Clusters ; Second time point ( T2 ) provide 6 7 week T1 coincide post-training assessment Cluster B pre-training assessment Cluster A ; Finally time point ( T3 ) , 6 7 week T2 , constitute post-training assessment Cluster A . - Intervention program : Cogmed Working MemoryTraining ( RoboMemo® , CogMed-Cognitive Medical Systems , Stockholm , Sweden ) online treatment comprise number visuo-spatial verbal exercise vary automatically depend individual child 's performance give task . The training period intensive include 25 home session five week , 30-45 minute day . A Cogmed-trained coach monitor train progress participant ' commitment daily training period , corresponding time period T1-T2 Cluster B T2-T3 Cluster A . - Plan Missing data : Unavailable interpretable ( significantly range ) pre-post training data ( behavioural neurophysiological ) consider miss . The patient complete training exclude analysis . - Plan Statistical analysis : Univariate Multivariate statistical analysis perform compare neuropsychological performance electrophysiological pattern different time point . Correlational analysis also perform study association neuropsychological electrophysiological data .</detailed_description>
