	<brief_title>A Phase 1 , 2-Part Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetics Multiple Doses ASLAN003 Healthy Elderly Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , randomise , single-blind , placebo-controlled , 2 stage study design 2 multiple dose cohort healthy elderly subject . Randomisation 3:1 ratio ensure 6 subject receive ASLAN003 2 subject receive placebo feed condition . Up maximum 16 subject ( two cohort ) plan study . Subjects randomise receive ASLAN003 100mg match placebo daily 14 consecutive day . After 8 subject complete 14 day dose , Investigator , Sponsor review available safety PK data subject decide proceed stage 2 study . In Stage 2 , 8 subject randomise receive ASLAN003 100mg match placebo daily 14 consecutive day . Following screen visit must fall within 28 day prior first dose Investigational Product ( IP ) part , subject qualify ( accord protocol-defined inclusion exclusion criterion ) admit study centre Day -1 . Dose administration study part commence Day 1 . The subject stay study centre throughout 14 day dose ( D-1 toD15 ) . Full PK blood collection do D1 , D8 D14 , single trough PK blood collection D4 D11 . All subject discharge D15 ask return single PK blood sample D16 , D17 , D18 , D19 ( +5days post-dose ) , full outpatient visit include safety follow lab test Day 19 .</detailed_description>
