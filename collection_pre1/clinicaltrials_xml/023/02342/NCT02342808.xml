	<detailed_description>The term resistant hypertension ( RH ) define clinic blood pressure ( BP ) remain goal ( e.g. , systolic blood pressure [ SBP ] &gt; 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure [ DBP ] &gt; 90 mm Hg ) , despite adherence regimen 3 antihypertensive medication different class , one diuretic . With grow prevalence hypertension ( HTN ) country , RH major public health concern , affect 7.5 million Americans . Patients RH 50 % likely experience CVD event , include stroke , kidney failure , myocardial infarction , death , compare patient control BP . There urgent need develop RH management strategy low BP well reduce high risk CVD-related event . Lifestyle modification , include exercise training dietary modification , proven efficacy lower BP unmedicated patient HTN often recommend first step treat high BP . The Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) diet show low BP HTN patient treat drug . Moreover , DASH diet combine exercise caloric restriction , even great , quite mark , BP reduction achieve . However , efficacy lifestyle modification HTN patient refractory medical therapy unknown . This application aim build upon evidence support value lifestyle modification unmedicated patient HTN propose randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) evaluate whether intensive , medically-supervised lifestyle intervention successfully low BP medicate patient RH .</detailed_description>
