	<brief_title>Iodine Impregnated Incision Drapes Bacterial Recolonization Simulated Knee Surgery . A Controlled Randomized Experimental Trial .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Surgical site infection ( SSI ) serious complication orthopaedic surgery , result re-operation prolonged recovery ( 1 , 2 ) To prevent SSI , prophylactic method introduce part procedure many type surgery . Prophylactic strategy preoperative disinfection use chlorhexidine iodine solution alcohol show decrease number skin bacteria prior surgical incision intravenous catheter insertion . ( 3-7 ) . Creating completely aseptic environment duration surgery however impossible , due inability preoperative disinfection completely sterilize skin , combine re-colonization patient endogenous flora hair follicle , sebaceous gland sweat gland . ( 6 ) ( 8 , 9 ) The use self-adhesive plastic drape introduce prevent contamination surgical site due re-colonizing skin flora , block translocation bacteria skin adjacent surgical site surgical wound . Self-adhesive plastic incision drape way design work barrier , contain skin flora surgery . These type drape however find inferior prevent bacterial SSI , compare new drape type incorporate antiseptic iodine-complex drape adhesive , face skin ( 10 , 11 ) This outcome might explain drape-induced `` greenhouse effect '' support evidence increase bacterial colonization-rate intraoperative use non-iodine self-adhesive plastic drape ( 12 , 13 ) . This effect may result relative occlusion skin lead increase skin hydration . ( 14 ) This increase bacterial growth never demonstrate iodine impregnate self-adhesive incision drape ( IIAD ) contradict study report reduction re-colonization rate skin bacteria abdomen IIAD compare drape non-iodine drape author report decrease surgical wound contamination IIAD use preoperatively abdominal surgery ( 3 , 15 ) Regardless superiority IIAD non-iodine drape , recently conclude meta-analysis , use IIAD reduce SSI incidence compare draping ( 10 ) . This conclusion criticize due type 2 error result relatively low rate SSI clean surgery ( 16 ) The review , however , contain minimal data use IIAD orthopaedic surgery . The transferability conclusion orthopaedic set therefore questionable . Skin flora , predominately staphylococci , primary course SSI orthopaedic surgery ( 17 , 18 ) also show constitute majority recolonizing specie skin ( 8 , 19 ) . IIAD therefore become part standard preoperative procedure many orthopaedic surgical setting hospital Southern Denmark , include Odense University Hospital Svendborg Hospital . This decision may justify in-vitro study conclude mark bactericidal effect IIAD broad range bacterial specie , especially staphylococci . ( 16 ) The bactericidal effect IIAD also evaluate in-vivo hip surgery , bactericidal effect significant reduction wound contamination report IIAD apply 24 hour prior skin sample ( 20 ) . The bactericidal effect however evaluate IIAD apply surgical start prior incision , normal practice orthopaedic surgery . Re-colonization skin bacteria follow disinfection show occur completely partially within 7 day skin disinfect chlorhexidine iodine solution cover polyurethane dressing , contain antimicrobial . ( 21-24 ) Re-colonization may however already detectable within hour follow disinfection . This however associate significant increase SSI rate . ( 3 , 13 ) It worth note evidence suggest skin preparation solution contain chlorhexidine , may reside skin provide residual antiseptic action . ( 25-27 ) IIAD show improve incidence SSI non-orthopaedic surgery retrospective evidence suggest similar finding hip surgery ( 28 ) . It therefore great relevance shine light effect IIAD orthopaedic surgical setting . Motivation Iodine impregnate self-adhesive plastic drape use many type surgery year . Despite , use proven decrease incidence SSI . SSI result intraarticular infection skin bacteria well-known serious complication orthopaedic surgery . The evaluation prophylactic measure IIAD therefore desperately need . In spite , orthopaedic surgery poorly represent current literature subject . It goal study add knowledge effect use IIAD dermal bacterial growth orthopaedic surgical setting . Objectives The objective study evaluate effect intraoperative application iodine impregnate self-adhesive drape bacterial quantity ( colony form unit ) skin patient schedule total knee replacement surgery ( TKA ) . We wish investigate intraoperative draping IIAD increase re-colonization skin microbe compare drape use simulate TKA surgery . Primary outcome microbial quantity , secondary outcome identification viable organisms skin . The hypothesis IIAD increase re-colonization skin microbe compare drape use . Method Study design The study design experimental randomize control trial perform parallel setting . Patients serve control allocation ratio therefore equal . Participants Patients recruit prospective manner outpatient clinic osteoarthritis knee , Odense University Hospital . The attend physician screen patient participation . Patients eligible inclusion schedule total knee replacement surgery Odense University Hospital . Reasons exclusion list . Sample size A difference bacterial quantity factor 10 ( 1.0 log10 ) intervention control group judge clinical significance development SSI . To detect difference 1.0 log bacterial quantity power level 80 % , significance level 5 % standard deviation 1.0 log10 , sample size 16 knee group require , necessitate inclusion 16 patient . To recruit number patient , inclusion period 6 month anticipate . Randomization Knee allocation drape vs. non-draping group randomize . Randomization ensure difference bacterial flora patient knees minimal effect outcome . Potential allocation bias minimize . In study allocation assign use envelope contain numbered paper sheet . The quality envelope assess ensure allocation determine without open envelope . 30 envelope prepare , determine allocation . An external party prepare envelop . Even number allocate participant drape right knee , odd number allocate left-side draping . The envelope contain even quantity even odd number . We suspect knowledge knee allocation important study outcome . It therefore deem necessary blind participant researcher intervention . Intervention The procedure take place surgical section orthopaedic ward Odense University hospital . Patients greet asked change local patient clothing . Patients position supine standard operate theatre , active laminar flow surgical lamp . An operating drape set level patient 's waist ensure minimal contamination patient breathe . Both knee disinfect use curcumin colour solution 0,5 % chlorhexidine 96 % ethanol apply paint motion 2 session 10 second separate 30 second drying period . The disinfected area leave completely dry . Disinfection follow standard cover area adjacent surgical site use surgical drape . One knee subsequently drape iodine plastic adhesive drape ( Ioban 2 ) , knee leave uncovered . Application drape do accordance 3M guideline . ( 11 ) If participant long hair leg , trim use electrical clipper prior intervention . The patient ask remain supine operating table 75 minute . Following disinfection subsequent draping knee , operate table place beach-chair position patient offer pillow support knee . This place surgical drape . The beach-chair position minimize discomfort stay supine elevate patient 's head ensure flexion knee . The patient allow move legs control manner , contaminate contralateral knee . Both knee must move equally ensure equal stress skin sample site intervention . The patient´s torso cover `` Bair Hugger '' blanket prevent hypothermia . The researcher nurse wear hairnet , sterile operation garment , sterile glove facemask disinfection application drape . The project nurse , experience apply draping , conformity standard hospital procedure . Skin sample Many method bacteriological skin sampling use early study . Since outcome study compare mean bacterial quantity , decide use modified version cup-scrub technique/cylinder sample method , standard method test preoperative skin preparation . ( 21 , 29 , 30 ) This method sample skin use cylinder restrict area sample small area cover drape . 1 ml sample solution apply sample cylinder . The sample site rub moderate pressure even grid formation sterile , plastic inoculation loop 1 minute . After rub , sample solution collect sterile test tube use sterile pipette . The sample process repeat , yield another sample , pool former . By use two scrub instead one , percentage organism remove sample site increase , scrub cutaneous surface appear vital part sample process . Even though majority organism locate near surface skin , adherent property , others situate deep part horny layer hair follicle . This might explain wash sample site without scrub inferior scrub-method , yield half organism sample scrubbing ( 30 ) . The efficiency method evaluate author see appropriate approach skin sample goal evaluate superficial resident/ '' hidden '' flora . ( 5 , 6 , 31 ) We acknowledge sample skin bacteria yield fraction total flora due relative inaccessibility deep residing flora . ( 6 ) Skin sample take bilaterally distal anterior thigh prior disinfection ass normal bacterial quantity . Following disinfection complete evaporation alcohol , baseline sample take knee order document equal bacterial quantity prior drape . After duration intervention ( 75 minute ) , post-intervention sample take no-drape knee , follow opening Ioban drape sample area use sterile scissor surgical forceps . The skin sample . Samples take suprapatellar skin area , correspond skin cover border quadriceps femoris muscle tendon infrapatellar area skin cover border patellar ligament . These area correspond skin border incision line medial para-patellar approach commonly use TKA surgery . The precise area sample region choose sampling time enable minimal leakage skin sample cylinder . 3 plate contain 5 % blood agar place table distance maximum 1 knee . These plate uncover open inoculation microorganism air operate theatre start intervention time 75 minute follow draping . The plate cover end intervention , follow final knee sampling . An unused sample sample fluid plat duplicate serve negative control . The researcher perform sampling , thereby ensure consistency sample routine . A nurse aid sample process . The control knee sample first prevent pre-sampling contamination contralateral knee , self-adhesive draping remove . The researcher nurse wear hairnet , sterile operation garment , sterile glove facemask sample . Sample solution neutralizer system The skin sample use sample solution consist phosphate buffer solution ( PBS ) contain 10 % polysorbate 80 ( Tween 80 ) , 1 % lecithin , 0,5 % Sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate 0,1 % Triton-x 100 pH adjust 7,9 . ( 21 , 32-35 ) The neutralizer system validate accordance American Society Testing Materials ( ASTM ) standard E-1054-08 `` Standard test method evaluation in-activators antimicrobial agent '' use Staph . epidermidis challenge organism exposure time 30 minute . Sample handle Following sampling , pool sample immediately plat operating theater . This ensure optimal bacterial viability presence triton-x carry-over contamination skin antiseptic , show inhibit bacterial growth even small concentration ( 33 , 36-38 ) . A validation study property sample fluid show inhibition microorganism growth plat perform within 30 minute sample . Inoculated plate transport microbiological department OUH incubation end intervention . Knee sample serially dilute sterile phosphate buffer ten-fold dilution 10-3 pre-disinfection sample 10-1 post-disinfection sample . Aliquots 100-200 microliters dilute undiluted specimen spread duplicate 5 % blood agar plate . All plat aerobically incubate 36-48 hour 35 degree Celsius . The air-inoculated plate negative control plat incubate along knee sample 36-48 hour 35 degree Celsius . Samples mark accordance cod system describe data management section protocol .
