	<brief_title>Emergency Evaluation Convalescent Plasma Ebola Viral Disease ( EVD ) Guinea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>West-Africa ravage bad outbreak Ebola Viral Disease ( EVD ) ever witness . Nine month onset , outbreak spiral currently appear control . One key factor contribute high mortality lack proven effective EVD specific treatment . The identification effective therapy medical public health priority . Convalescent whole blood ( CWB ) convalescent plasma ( CP ) prioritize World Health Organization ( WHO ) evaluate within short time span , widespread use therapy could implement rapidly proven effective . Both CWB CP contain EBV antibodies either could potentially value EVD therapy , however efficacy Ebola must still demonstrate . . This emergency , phase 2/3 , open-label , non-randomized , clinical trial evaluate CP add standardized supportive care ( SC ) patient confirm EVD . No patient refuse CP compatible product available effort make maximize CP availability study . EVD patient recruit period CP become available compatible CP available give SC follow study outcome . Data SC patient use comparator analysis study . The primary objective study ass CP + SC improve 14 day survival patient , compare SC alone . Secondary objective ; - ass 30 day survival CP + SC - ass relationship EV antibody level donate CP survival patient receive CP - ass relationship EV antibody level donate CP change level viral RNA blood patient receive CP - ass occurrence serious adverse reaction ( SARs ) relate CP transfusion Ebola patient - ass occurrence safety risk related CP transfusion health worker administer treatment - determine risk factor mortality despite administration CP ( identification patient likely benefit ) The Investigators aim enroll total number 130 - 200 patient treat CP assume equal number patient treat SC alone . The number patient treat SC determine time interval CP become available treatment availability CP throughout study . If would insufficient patient treated SC , patient treat research site prior study start may include comparison group . Patients recruit Ebola Treatment centre manage Medecins Sans Frontieres ( MSF ) Conakry . All patient and/or relative present centre inform study , invite provide consent time admission inside treatment centre . Only patient ebola infection confirm via polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) enrol study . After inclusion , eligibility intervention assess time enrollment ( patient move area patient confirm Ebola ) reassess regular interval long patient receive plasma transfusion . The re-assessment eligibility receive CP happen 8h 12h , repeat 48 hour inclusion . If eligibility criterion meet 48 hour inclusion , SC continue . A patient eligible receive CP meet one follow criterion : - History allergic reaction blood plasma product ( judged investigator treat physician ) ; ( first criterion definite re-assessed ) - Medical condition receipt additional fluid relate transfusion ( 250-500 ml case child 10 ml/kg ) may detrimental patient ( e.g . decompensated congestive heart failure renal failure ) . - Patients shock unresponsive fluid challenge - Patients shock sign multi-organ failure , define oliguria/anuria AND impaired consciousness AND/OR jaundice - Condition patient procedure plasma administration carry risk staff In line WHO guidance , two unit CP give . EVD patient transfuse ABO-compatible CP use standard procedure . Details modality transfusion find WHO guidance document MSF guideline blood transfusion . All patient close observation transfusion-related adverse reaction 4 hour transfusion . 24 hour start transfusion , blood sample collect viral load assessment . All aspects patient management accord MSF clinical guideline . The decision discharge patient take clinical ground , support laboratory result . After discharge , patient follow study team day 30 .</detailed_description>
