	<brief_summary>The frequency preoperative cardiac ischemia 30-days postoperative mortality much high previously assume , approximately 10 % patient undergoing non-cardiac surgery suffer postoperative myocardial injury . A recent danish study furthermore show patient treat high inspiratory oxygen fraction surgery high 1 year mortality compare patient treat low inspiratory fraction . This especially significant among patient undergo cancer surgery . A possible explanation , high oxygen fraction result oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction . With randomized cross-over study wish investigate effect high inspiratory oxygen fraction endothelial function among healthy male volunteer . The primary outcome endothelial function assess EndoPat system . Secondary outcome change oxidative biomarkers . Heart rate variability ( HRV ) record serve measure effect oxygen autonomic nervous system .</brief_summary>
