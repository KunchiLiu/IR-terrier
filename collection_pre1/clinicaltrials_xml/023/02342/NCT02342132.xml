	<brief_summary>Children neuromuscular disease ( NMDs ) weak chest muscle suffer frequent chest infection , hospital admission reduce life expectancy . Physiotherapy widely use limited research data support choice therapy . The investigator study clinical value three commonly use chest physiotherapy device child NMD 's measuring lung function test three treatment . This pilot study . The best device select long term study early physiotherapy intervention child NMDs . The treatment develop break cycle decrease lung volume poor secretion clearance , child NMDs , base logical unproved theory treatment : 1 . The loss lung volume reverse apply positive pressure lung via face mask - literally reinflating lung pressure . The three device investigator test provide positive pressure assistance inspiratory phase . 2 . The temporarily increase lung volume allow high expiratory flow rate help clear secretion . The expiratory phase assist manual chest compression , one device , help application negative pressure exhalation . All three device investigator wish compare follow two-step approach . The hypothesis behind study : 1 . Treatments combine positive pressure inhalation assist cough exhalation , produce measurable improvement lung volume expiratory cough flow rate test child NMDs . 2 . One three device test superior others . This provide research-based justification long term study value early intervention child NMDs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Methods Improve Expiratory Cough Flow Lung Volume Children With NMDs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current option respiratory care child NMDs include numerous device treatment propose improve secretion clearance lung function weak patient . Unfortunately treatment decision still base little personal opinion . In particular , almost carefully conducted study best form respiratory therapy child NMDs . Commonly use treatment option best list following heading : 1 . Chest physiotherapy . This broad term cover range therapy include postural drainage , manual percussion chest vibration . These treatment often precede inhaled medication intend mobilize secretion ( humidification , hypertonic saline , Dornase alpha ) . Chest physiotherapy study extensively cystic fibrosis ( 13 ) prospective study use child NMDs . The lack evidence clear long-term benefit combine need train assistant , limited application chest therapy in-patient treatment acute exacerbation . 2 . Breath stack . Inspiratory lung volume increase 'stacking ' repeat inhalation . This allow great cough flow improve secretion clearance . The simple method use bag , face mask one-way valve . Inspiratory volume also augment use mechanical non-invasive ventilator although care must take avoid over-inflation barotrauma ( 14 ) . The cough phase insufflation often augment external compression chest abdomen ( manually assist cough ) . While evidence breath stacking , without manually assist coughing , increase lung volume peak cough flow ( 15 ) , prospective study study long term effect . 3 . Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation . Devices group inflate lung inspiratory positive pressure phase follow rapidly negative pressure exhalation phase ( 16 ) . They widely use recommended prospective research support lack . As breath stacking , evidence short term improvement lung volume cough flow ( 17 ) follow MI-E treatment . There also retrospective review suggest technique effective well tolerate child ( 18 ) . However , prospective control study MI-E either adults child . 4 . Airway oscillation . Various device develop superimpose oscillatory wave flow normal breathing . The oscillating pressure wave intend help mobilise secretion expand atelectatic area lung . This achieve external vibrating vest deliver directly airway face mask . Prospective study vibrate vest show benefit ( 19 ) . However , research exist oscillation via mask beneficial short ( 20 ) long term study ( 21 ) . The newcomer important topic would forgive find lack research evidence difficult believe . Children NMDs complex management problem consume lot hospital resource . The mechanical device pay insurance company , government , cost many thousand dollar - surely money time base form evidence ? Unfortunately case . Two large review management NMDs British ( 2 ) American ( 22 ) thoracic society emphasize lack evidence . Both conclude major requirement management child research . The principal question management child NMDs whether early introduction effective respiratory therapy slow decline lung function help keep child hospital . That require long term study use therapy know effective , least short term . Such evidence - even short term evidence efficacy , available . Our study case compare new treatment establish therapy , case assess current widely use treatment order determine whether measurable benefit . The best three technique study form basis long term early intervention study . OBJECTIVES . The short , medium long term objective study follow : 1 . Short term objective . The principal short term aim answer follow research question : - Do positive pressure reparatory physiotherapy device increase lung volume peak cough flow child neuromuscular disease ? - If measurable effect lung mechanic , three commonly use device produce big benefit ? 2 . Medium term objective . Assuming investigator show one three device significant beneficial short term effect lung mechanic , investigator use device much long term study . This investigate possibility early intervention effective physiotherapy slow decline lung function child NMDs . This one main question management child NMDs never address . 3 . Long term objective . This proposal third series plan study child NMDs . Our long term objective help base management patient group diseases firm research basis . RESEARCH METHOD . Patient recruitment . Patients enrol NMD clinic child 's hospital initially inform study letter sign director NMD clinic , Dr Selby . At next routine clinic visit , approach one two PIs ( Dr Seear Dr Selby ) . They give information study handout cover detail . Once time consider information , invite enroll study . Patient eligibility . The study open child neuro-muscular disease type , enrol NMD clinic child 's hospital . The main end point lung function measurement child need old enough perform test process . For cognitively normal child usually 5 6 yrs age . All three treatment administer face mask , apart lack consent clinical instability , exclusion criterion factor limit use face mask . Those child poor mask seal due facial structural abnormality , tracheostomy ineligible study General study design . After enrolment NMD clinic , child study batch 15 . Each batch study three consecutive weekday receive three treatment . On study day , group fifteen randomize group five receive one three physiotherapy treatment . Each participant receive treatment end study subsequently consider one group . Randomization remove chance see effect may due combination individual treatment . Before treatment , lung function test measure study staff blind type treatment . The respiratory function test make treatment device . By end study period batch , every child complete three treatment . Study treatment protocol . In absence detail research study , widely accept protocol govern three study treatment . After discussion physiotherapy respiratory technician , investigator design three study protocol representative accepted common practice . Each treatment administer qualified physiotherapist familiar clinical use machine . The treatment also monitor physician three treatment room . Each child receive follow study treatment random order three consecutive weekday : Measured end point . The effect three respiratory treatment assess use standard lung function test . A baseline obtain prior treatment . Repeat test perform immediately treatment , Â½ , 1 2 hour later . Comparative predictive lung function value base algorithms rely patient height . In child severe spinal deformity , arm span use surrogate height . All test make qualified respiratory technician use regularly maintain calibrated equipment . The staff measuring , report store result blind child 's therapy . Other test commonly use assessment child NMDs , oximetry capnography , measure since unlikely change short duration study . The following end point measure : lung volume , cough expiratory flow , muscle strength . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS . Measured endpoint . There 4 measure endpoint : vital capacity ( FVC ml ) , peak expiratory flow ( PEF L/min ) , plus maximal inspiratory expiratory pressure ( MIP MEP cm H2O ) . All continuous variable express mean+/- one standard deviation . Apart graphical presentation result , statistical test comparison pre-treatment post treatment value four variable . Sample size . Before undertake long term study early intervention one three device , investigator would like least 80 % sure device able produce significant improvement lung mechanic ( 20 % improvement post treatment mechanic ) . There hundred type NMD child investigator test treatment effect three device . Unfortunately , currently reliable evidence magnitude ( even existence ) treatment effect also standard deviation effect . There also evidence treatment variation use different sub-types NMD . There basic data upon base calculation sample size . The investigator would make many guess calculate number would reliability . Our response try enroll many child possible . There 200 child NMD clinic . The investigator hope able enroll least 100 . Statistical test . Any treatment effect detect compare baseline lung function test post treatment value measure 0 , 1/2 , 1 2 hour end treatment . Each child 's baseline value serve control . Multiple comparison pre post value make use Analysis Variance Tukey post-hoc test .</detailed_description>
