	<brief_summary>The investigator propose prospective blind randomize control trial ( RCT ) ass efficacy safety simple method continuous infusion local anesthetic , ropivacaine , via surgical wound control pain ureteropelvic junction ( UPJ ) stenosis correction child first 48 hr surgery . The investigator hypothesize technique provide great pain relief post-operatively reduce need systemic opioid use along reduction associate side effect analgesic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy Safety Local Anesthetic Infusion With Ropivacaine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize continuous infusion local anesthetic via wound catheter would improve postoperative pain control UPJ correction diminish adverse effect associate current use opioids , administer via epidural systemic route , management postoperative pain . The expected benefit wind catheter infusion reduction postoperative opioids requirement thereby diminish associate side effect sedation , respiratory depression , nausea , vomit , ileus occur average rate 50 % child adolescent base recent meta-analysis . It may also facilitate early oral intake , ambulation early discharge hospital . The current use epidural indwelling catheter analgesia associate 20-25 % technical failure rate catheter misplacement , occlusion , disconnect dislodgement , premature discontinuation analgesia due opioid-related side effect , require bladder catheterization , local anesthetic induce weakness low extremity usually delay ambulation . The dose local anesthetic infuse via epidural route much large propose via wound catheter carry great risk systemic toxicity compare infusion dos anticipate via wound catheter infusion . In addition , use opioids morphine hydromorphone via epidural indwell catheter produce adverse effect similar systemic opioids require electronic close nursing monitoring . Study Design The study include patient , male female , age 3 month 14 year ethnic race group . Patients history clinically significant cardiovascular , pulmonary , hepatic , renal , neurologic , psychiatric metabolic disease exclude . After obtain consent legal guardian , patient randomly assign placebo treatment group . Both group receive rescue opioids postoperative pain management via either patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) nurse-controlled analgesia ( NCA ) administration young patient . The intraoperative anesthetic management standardize patient . The wound catheter ( Soaker multi-orifice catheter approve FDA ) place completion surgery subcutaneous space parallel proximal surgical incision surgeon . The Pain Treatment Service manage postoperative pain standardized protocol include infusion ropivacaine via wound catheter administration rescue opioids via PCA/NCA . Patients randomly assign receive infusion either ropivacaine saline via wound catheter . Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure total amount opioids consume patient treatment group compare consume placebo group , note potential opioid-sparing effect patient treat continuous wound catheter ropivacaine versus saline placebo group . The secondary outcome measure include composite pain assessment scale ( FLACC ) , use self-report observation scale , incidence opioid-related incidence nausea , vomit , sedation respiratory depression , time first feed ( measure return bowel function ) , transition oral analgesic , time first ambulation time discharge hospital . Finally , adverse outcomes related local anesthetic infusion , catheter related infection technical failure catheter occlusion premature dislodgement record . Patient Recruitment Patients identify Urology Clinic schedule office recruit Pre-operative Anesthesia Clinic . Data Collection Outcome measure data record nurse physician unaware randomization 48hrs post-operatively . The following outcome measure record . The total amount opioids consume patient first 48hrs surgery , The daily total amount pattern opioid use via PCA NCA pump record electronic medical record . The pain assessment score adverse effect opioids local anesthetic administration record standardized protocol . Other outcome measure include incidence emesis , time first feed oral intake , pain intensity assessment self-report older child observation young child , time discharge . Statistical Analysis Power analysis indicate 48 patient randomize equally group ( n=24 per group ) provide 80 % ( alpha= 0.05 , beta= 0.20 ) power detect 25 % difference total opioid usage first 48 hour postoperatively . Fisher 's exact test use compare binomial proportion nausea/vomiting , sedation , respiratory depression , ileus , proportion patient require postoperative opioids . In addition , group compare use Kaplan-Meier curve construct model time first oral intake log-rank test compare group 95 % confidence interval derive use Greenwood 's formula . A Uniform ( 0,1 ) random number generator use determine treatment allocation minimize covariate imbalance ropivacaine saline group . Two-tailed value p &lt; 0.05 regard statistically significant . Summary The investigator anticipate simple measure wound catheter infusion ropivacaine demonstrate significant safe effective modality analgesia postoperative period . If result valid , improved pain modulation simple , low-tech modality postoperative pain control ( ) require investigation large patient population include broad category surgical procedure determine limit efficacy technique particular surgical procedure , ( b ) may demonstrate statistically clinically significant decrease pain decrease opioid demand , ( c ) may lessen time recovery side effect secondary opioid use ( ) offer significant cost-benefit in-patient care relative currently use modality epidural analgesia systemic opioids management postoperative pain child undergo UPJ correction ( e ) compare presently use epidural PCA opioid analgesia , wound catheter analgesia expect less demand nurse physician ( i.e . Pain Treatment Service ) , staff time , attention need close monitoring .</detailed_description>
