	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Alemtuzumab Given Combination With CHOP ESHAP Patients Newly Diagnosed With Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma ( PTCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alemtuzumab ( Campath-1H ) humanize monoclonal antibody target CD52 , cell surface protein present high density normal malignant B T lymphocytes . CHOP ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine prednisolone ) currently regard standard chemotherapy regimen patient newly diagnose NHL . ESHAP ( etoposide , methylprednisolone , cisplatin , cytosine arabinoside ) chemotherapy invented 1994 . The regimen aim salvage NHL patient relapse refractory front-line , mostly doxorubicin-based , chemotherapy.Major toxicity myelosuppression ; 30 % patient develop febrile neutropenia admit parenteral antibiotic . Treatment-related death , mostly uncontrolled sepsis , occur 4 % patient . Because efficacy tolerable toxicity , present , ESHAP one salvage chemotherapy regimens frequently administer patient especially prior autologous stem cell transplantation . Recently , unit report efficacy combination standard CHOP chemotherapy ESHAP high-dose therapy autologous stem cell transplantation rituximab give upfront therapy patient newly diagnose poor prognosis aggressive NHL ( high- high-intermediate risk group accord international index ) .15,16 According previous institutional experience well efficacy combination CHOP ESHAP patient high-risk aggressive lymphoma , would like therefore determine outcome alemtuzumab give combination CHOP ESHAP patient newly diagnose PTCL , effectiveness know .</detailed_description>
