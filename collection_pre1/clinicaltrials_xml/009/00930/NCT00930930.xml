	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving chemotherapy together everolimus surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . It yet know whether cisplatin paclitaxel effective give together without everolimus treat patient breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well cisplatin paclitaxel work give together without everolimus treat patient stage II stage III breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin Paclitaxel With Without Everolimus Treating Patients With Stage II Stage III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine pathological complete response patient triple-negative , stage II III breast cancer treat neoadjuvant cisplatin paclitaxel without everolimus . Secondary - To determine safety profile treatment regimen . - To evaluate tumor response treatment regimen measure ultrasound definitive surgery . - To evaluate rate breast conservation surgery treatment regimen . - To determine treatment-mediated change cell cycle position , proliferation , apoptosis well status , level , phosphorylation state S6K , p53 , p73 , p63 select p53 family target gene initiation paclitaxel . - To isolate RNA generate microarray data set pre- post-treatment biopsy material identify pre-treatment gene signature predict response . - To isolate RNA generate microarray data set pre- post-treatment biopsy material identify change gene signature first treatment predict response . - To isolate RNA generate microarray data set pre- post-treatment biopsy material determine previously establish p63 p73 gene signature predict response treatment . - To isolate RNA generate microarray data set pre- post-treatment biopsy material determine change observe p63 p73 gene signature pre- post-treatment biopsy . - To isolate RNA generate microarray data set pre- post-treatment biopsy material determine triple-negative breast cancer cluster different subtypes basis gene expression , give size microarray data set generate clinical trial previous clinical trial ( &gt; 100 tumor ) . - To isolate RNA generate microarray data set pre- post-treatment biopsy material determine p63 p73 gene signature sub-classify triple-negative breast cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord initial lymph node status ( positive v negative involvement ) tumor grade ( low intermediate v high ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive cisplatin IV 1 hour oral everolimus weekly week 1-12 paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly week 4-12 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive cisplatin IV 1 hour oral placebo weekly week 1-12 paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly week 4-12 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Approximately 3-6 week completion neoadjuvant therapy , patient undergo partial total mastectomy lymph node evaluation . Patients may receive additional chemotherapy radiotherapy . Patients undergo ultrasound-guided core biopsy baseline week 1 , 4 , 12 analysis proliferation , apoptosis , pathway activity marker via IHC western blot RNA microarrays . Patients follow within 3 week surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility criterion Maximum number patient include twothirds patient Arm 1 onethird patient Arm 2 ( total 145 patient ) . Estimated time accrual ~ 3 patients/month would ~ 3.5 year . Inclusion criterion : Patients must provide informed write consent . Patient must ≥ 18 year age . ECOG performance status 01 . Clinical stage II stage III triplenegative ( ER and/or PR stain weak stain less equal 10 % cell immunohistochemistry [ IHC ] HER2negative Herceptest [ 0 , 1+ ] FISH ) invasive mammary carcinoma , confirm histological analysis . Patients measurable* residual tumor primary site *Measurable disease : mass reproducibly measure physical examination , mammogram , and/or ultrasound accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) 10 mm ( 1 cm ) , either breast axillary lymph node . Available core biopsy time diagnosis . Fresh tissue must obtainable baseline fresh tissue biopsy prior treatment initiation . Patients undergo surgical treatment either segmental resection total mastectomy . Patients must adequate hematologic , hepatic , renal function . All test must obtain less 4 week study entry . This include : ANC &gt; /=1500/mm3 Platelet count &gt; /=100,000/mm3 Creatinine &lt; /=1.5X upper limit normal Bilirubin , SGOT , SGPT &lt; /=1.5X upper limit normal* * patient Gilbert‟s syndrome , direct bilirubin measure instead total bilirubin . The patient must anyprior chemotherapy primary breast cancer . Patients prior history contralateral breast cancer eligible evidence recurrence initial primary breast cancer within last 5 year . Able swallow retain oral medication . Four day prior biopsy procedure patient must medication could increase risk bleed ( i.e . ASA , NSAIDS , Coumadin , heparin product ) Potential subject must complete screen assessment outline protocol . The premenopausal patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test agree use birth control method participate study . Note : Women childbearing potential male counterpart use barrier method contraception 3 month follow protocol therapy . Ineligibility Criteria Locally recurrent breast cancer . Pregnant lactating woman . Evidence distant metastatic disease ( i.e . lung , liver , bone , brain , etc . ) Use CYP3A4 modifier ( Appendix A ) Serious medical illness judgment treat physician place patient high risk operative mortality . Malabsorption syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel . History malignancy . Subjects diseasefree 5 year , subject history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer successfully treat situ carcinoma eligible . History hepatitis B hepatitis C. If patient judge risk exposure viral B C hepatitis ( i.e . illicit IV drug use , blood transfusion prior 1990 , body piercing , tattoo , etc . ) , appropriate testing perform ( i.e . Hepatitis B surface antigen antibody , Hepatitis C antibody ) Active uncontrolled infection require parenteral antibiotic . Dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent . Symptomatic neuropathy ( ≥ grade 2 ) . Concurrent anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery , immunotherapy , hormonal therapy , biologic therapy ) one specify protocol . Concurrent treatment investigational agent . Used investigational drug within 15 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , precede first dose randomized therapy .</criteria>
