Since people psoriasis significantly high rate metabolic syndrome regard fact NAFLD consider hepatic manifestation MS , purpose study determine prevalence NAFLD subject psoriasis compare non -psoriatic population . We design case control study patient attend dermatologic clinic GWU clinical diagnosis psoriasis . By perform limited RUQ abdominal ultrasonography GWU hospital , able screen patient possible diagnosis NAFLD . Since NAFLD diagnosis exclusion , patient screen positive NAFLD , evaluate ruling etiology fatty liver alcohol abuse hepatitis .</detailed_description>
