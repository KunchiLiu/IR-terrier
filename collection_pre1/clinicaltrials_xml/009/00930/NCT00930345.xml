	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Sunitinib , SUTENT , promise multi-target TKI treatment metastatic renal cell carcinoma cytokine failure . In previous phase II study , ORR 40 % TTP = 8,7 month . A phase III randomize trial Sunitinib versus interferon alpha first-line therapy patient mRCC show significantly longer PFS Sunitinib group ( 11 month ) interferon group ( 5 month ) , hazard ratio 0.42 ( 95 % CI , 0.32 0.54 , p &lt; 0.001 ) . Initial approval second line treatment mRCC extend first line therapy 11-01-2007 . Mechanisms action involve therapeutic effect antiangiogenic compound fully elucidate . As today , validate biomarkers image marker predict monitor activity type compound . Recent finding field cancer biology , tumor angiogenesis , immunology image provide several biomarker candidate assess metastatic renal cell carcinoma . BASIC RESEARCH Biomarkers It seem interesting measure different biological marker could modulate antiangiogenic therapeutic . Some known prognostic factor metastatic renal carcinoma , others directly link mechanism action Sunitinib . Due biopsy prior treatment initiation nephrectomy treatment initiation , possible evaluate biomarkers modification assess potential link tumour response . VHL gene alteration ( mutation , deletion , hypermethylations ) observe high frequency 80 % case clear-cell renal cell carcinoma . The molecular mechanism involve angiogenesis presence genetic alteration yet well know . The function pVHL/aHIF/VEGF/angiogenesis pathway investigated renal cell carcinoma obtain biopsy nephrectomy . Molecular marker define VHL status , expression proteomic profiling may helpful predict responder . Sunitinib potent inhibitor tyrosine kinase activity several receptor : VEGFR-2 , main receptor responsible mediate proangiogenic effect vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , express vascular endothelial cell ; PDGFR , receptor platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , express pericytes serve structural support cell endothelial cell . Consistent biochemical activity , Sunitinib inhibit vitro mitogenic response human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVECs ) stimulate VEGF bFGF ( basic fibrosblast growth factor ) , another proangiogenic factor . VEGF gene polymorphism In physiologic pathologic condition , important variation VEGF blood level report correlate constitutional VEGF-A gene polymorphism locate intronic region . Moreover , VEGF-A polymorphism describe predisposition prognostic factor several human malignancy bladder , breast , melanoma , prostate head neck carcinoma . Hence , interest see whether polymorphism could affect tumor clinical presentation correlate VEGF-levels response antiangiogenic treatment sunitinib . Immunology Tumor angiogenesis impact immune response renal cell carcinoma patient . A naturally occur CD4+ T cell subset , regulatory CD4+CD25+ T cell , emerge dominant T cell population govern peripheral self- tolerance inhibit effector T cell . The ability anti-angiogenic therapy block VEGF may allow good maturation dendritic cell reduction number regulatory CD4+CD25+T cell . The aim project test whether administration Sunitinib modulate concentration regulatory CD4+CD25+T cell , correlation immunology parameter response observe . Imaging Radiological evaluation tumor response also challenge anti-angiogenic drug . Criteria base solely size may inadequate evaluation anti-angiogenic therapy efficacy . The unbridled expansion tumor vessel lead development abnormal vessel , distinct microvascular characteristic : high perfusion ( blood flow ) , porous wall leak molecule interstitium ( permeability ) . New image technique dynamic contrast-enhanced CT develop quantify characterize unique property , may use marker response angiogenesis inhibitor . Imaging assay angiogenic status therefore offer potential clinically measure anti angiogenic effect drug tumor vessel , effect may reflect change tumor dimension . These effect may detectable hour day time treatment initiation , rather week month need typically detect change tumor size . Exploration local tumor vascular architecture help understand mechanism action Sunitinib . This vasculature seem poor functionality tumor vascularization adequately assess global index global tumor blood flow . In addition , exploration renal tumor vascularization contrast-enhanced US perform compare blood flow determine CT US .</detailed_description>
