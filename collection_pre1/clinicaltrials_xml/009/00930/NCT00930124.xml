	<brief_summary>Cleft lip palate patient normally present sunken face due collapse middle part face inability upper low teeth meet chewing . This situation constitute serious aesthetic mastication problem . A single surgical operation know orthognathic surgery traditionally perform move upper jaw forward normal position allow chew function regain . However , due scar tissue original surgical repair cleft palate , procedure know unstable cause bone rapidly go back original position . A new concept move upper jaw bone gradually 1mm per day use special device attach bone call distraction osteogenesis establish 1996 . Animal study show technique produce stable result minimal relapse . The feasibility correct cleft deformity gradual distraction confirm clinical study . The aim study ( first kind ) conduct prospective randomize control study compare treatment outcomes current standard ( orthognathic surgery ) distraction osteogenesis ( gradual bone movement ) . The objective focus four aspect : morbidity , stability , speech function psychological impact . The result study clarify several clinical dilemma decision make choose whether use orthognathic surgery distraction osteogenesis treatment cleft lip palate patient . In addition , also inform multidisciplinary research team improve total care cleft lip palate patient . Gradual bone distraction midface cleft palate patient stable , less detrimental speech , troublesome patient conventional osteotomy bone transposition ( orthognathic surgery ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cleft Orthognathic Surgery Versus Distraction Osteogenesis - Which Better ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Maxillary hypoplasia lead sunken midface common developmental problem CLP patient related combination congenital reduction midfacial growth surgical scar repair cleft palate . Therefore CLP patient commonly present short midface narrow hard palate severe malocclusion . Conventional orthognathic surgery advance , expand lengthen maxilla normal position relation skull occlusion . However , immediate surgical transposition cleave maxilla technically difficult due severe deformity demand large surgical movement tension palatal scar . Studies demonstrate repositioned maxilla rather unstable long term . In addition , velopharyngeal competence could compromise immediate advancement technique result abnormally nasal speech . The feasibility gradual lengthen under-developed mandible syndromal patient distraction osteogenesis proven . The gradual movement maxilla activate implanted distractors theoretically overcome tension palatal scar soft palate musculature . This may reduce long term skeletal relapse cleft maxilla speech distortion . On hand , distraction procedure involve surgical insertion removal operation retention device two month period . This may increase chance infection , social inconvenience ultimately affect patient 's satisfaction .</detailed_description>
