	<brief_title>Effect High Testosterone Sleep-associated Slowing Follicular Luteinizing Hormone ( LH ) Frequency Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During follicular phase normal menstrual cycle , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) pulse frequency decrease sleep . These decrease may important support follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) synthesis secretion . Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) associate persistently rapid gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) pulse frequency , abnormality may account many hormonal manifestation PCOS . Although one prior study suggest nocturnal LH frequency decrease slightly PCOS , methodological issue limit interpretation . Our preliminary data suggest nocturnal LH frequency decrease untreated PCOS , nocturnal decrease LH frequency restore androgen receptor blockade ( flutamide ) woman PCOS . We two hypothesis : ( 1 ) Prior flutamide administration , sleep-associated slow LH pulse frequency less pronounced woman PCOS compare normally-cycling woman late follicular phase menstrual cycle ; ( 2 ) After 4 week flutamide administration , sleep-associated LH frequency reduction woman PCOS similar normally-cycling woman late follicular phase menstrual cycle . Women PCOS normally-cycling woman study . For study participant , LH pulse frequency determine ( 1500 0700 h ) 4 week flutamide 4 week placebo . Flutamide placebo give random order ( i.e. , cross-over study ) . Sleep formally evaluate . Flutamide give 4 week prior reassessment LH pulse frequency . LH pulse frequency analyze way hierarchical mixed effect model . We use statistical analysis determine : ( ) whether wake vs. sleep difference LH frequency PCOS normal control prior flutamide , ( b ) whether mean wake vs. sleep difference LH frequency two group flutamide .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion participant : Subjects 1835 year old ; use cutoff age 35 early menopause age rare . No significant health problem ( PCOS obesity ) . Subjects willing strictly avoid pregnancy ( use nonhormonal method ) time study must willing able provide inform consent . Inclusion criterion normal control : Controls healthy woman regular menstrual cycle evidence hyperandrogenism . Inclusion criterion PCOS : PCOS define accord NIH consensus criterion . As , subject PCOS hyperandrogenism , whether clinical ( e.g. , hirsutism ) biochemical ( i.e. , elevate plasma T ) . Subjects PCOS also oligo amenorrhea ( i.e. , &lt; 7 period per year ) evidence endocrinopathies ( e.g. , hyperprolactinemia , Cushing 's syndrome , etc. ) . Being study GnRH pulse regulation woman without PCOS , men exclude . Obesity associate diagnose ( genetic ) syndrome , obesity relate medication ( e.g. , glucocorticoid ) , etc . Pregnancy lactation . Virilization . A total testosterone &gt; 150 ng/dl woman PCOS ( suggest possibility virilize neoplasm ) ( confirm repeat ) . Elevated DHEAS ( mild elevation may see PCOS , elevation &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal accepted PCOS ) ( confirm repeat ) . Follicular 17hydroxyprogesterone &gt; 300 ng/dl , suggest possibility congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( elevated luteal phase concern possibility congenital adrenal hyperplasia , 17hydroxyprogesterone may collect follicular phase , &gt; 60 oligomenorrheic ) . *NOTE : If 17hydroxyprogesterone &gt; 300 ng/dl confirm repeat testing , ACTH stimulate 17hydroxyprogesterone &lt; 1000 ng/dl require study participation . A previous diagnosis diabetes , fast glucose â‰¥ 126 mg/dl , hemoglobin A1c &gt; 6.5 % Abnormal TSH ( subject adequately treat hypothyroidism , reflect normal TSH value , exclude ; , new diagnosis hypothyroidism , study least delayed pending appropriate treatment ) ( confirm repeat ) . Abnormal prolactin ( mild elevation may see PCOS , elevation &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal accept group ) ( confirm repeat ) . Evidence Cushing 's syndrome history physical exam . Hematocrit &lt; 36 % hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dl ( reversed iron treatment ) . Significant history cardiac pulmonary dysfunction ( e.g. , know suspect congestive heart failure ; asthma require intermittent systemic corticosteroid ; etc . ) Liver test abnormality ( confirm repeat ) , exception mild bilirubin elevation accept set know Gilbert 's syndrome . Abnormal sodium potassium ( confirmed repeat ) ; bicarbonate concentration &lt; 20 &gt; 30 ( confirm repeat ) ; elevate creatinine concentration ( confirmed repeat ) . Due amount blood drawn study , subject body weight &lt; 110 lb exclude study .</criteria>
