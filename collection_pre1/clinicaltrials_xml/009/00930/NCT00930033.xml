	<brief_summary>The study compare standard treatment nephrectomy + sunitinib treatment sunitinib alone without nephrectomy . This study first trial competitive context</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Assess Importance Nephrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 2 previous study impact nephrectomy ( EORTC , SWOG ) metastatic renal cell carcinoma justified recommendation initial nephrectomy patient present metastatic renal cell carcinoma . But study perform time immunotherapy . The objective Evaluation importance nephrectomy patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma treat sunitinib ( AA ) Arm A : Nephrectomy follow Sunitinib Arm B : Sunitinib alone Sunitinib administrate orally daily 4 week follow 2 week rest ( schedule 4/2 ) , 6 week consider cycle The start dose 50 mg daily provision dose reduction base tolerability Patient treat disease progression unacceptable toxicity occurrence withdraw .</detailed_description>
