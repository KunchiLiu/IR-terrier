	<brief_summary>Objective : To examine respiratory/physiological subjective respond well genetic transmission among offspring parent history current panic disorder ( PD ) diagnosis determine whether diagnoses/symptoms , endophenotypes , genetic profile offspring differentially relate parent PD subtypes ( i.e. , respiratory non-respiratory panic ) . Study population : Approximately 400 offspring 200 parent current past PD . Approximately 200 offsping/100 parent PD enrol NIH/NIMH remainder Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond , VA. Design : A high-risk family design use wherein parent either current past diagnosis PD offspring ( ) ( age 9 20 ) recruit . &lt; TAB &gt; Outcome measure : Outcome measure include physiological recording respiratory , cardiac , electrodermal respond 10 minute baseline follow 15 minute 5 % carbon dioxide enrich air ( CO2 ) . Research participant also complete parent child self-report measure provide DNA sample use saliva protocol . A full listing self-reports provide Outcome Measures Section .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective study examine respiratory/physiological subjective respond well genetic transmission among offspring parent history current panic disorder ( PD ) diagnosis . Our goal determine whether diagnoses/symptoms , endophenotypes , genetic profile offspring differentially relate parent PD subtypes ( i.e. , respiratory non-respiratory panic ) . Study population : Approximately 80 offspring age 9 20 year age parent current past history PD recruit . Approximately 40 offspring enrol NIH/NIMH remainder Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond , VA. Design : Offspring ( ) age 9 20 parent history PD recruit . A complete psychiatric history obtain child participant . Child participant also complete questionnaire measure , provide sample DNA , participate carbon dioxide CO ( 2 ) lab challenge . The CO ( 2 ) lab challenge primary outcome measure . Outcome measure : Our primary outcome measure include physiological recording respiratory , cardiac , electrodermal respond 10 minute baseline follow 15 minute 5 % carbon dioxide enrich air ( CO ( 2 ) . Research participant also complete parent child self-report measure provide DNA sample use saliva protocol . A full listing self-reports provide Outcome Measures Section .</detailed_description>
