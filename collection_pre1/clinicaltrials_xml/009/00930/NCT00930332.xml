	<brief_title>Methadone Hydrochloride First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Chronic Neuropathic Cancer Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine optimum start dose ( define dose require modification within first 4 day treatment lack efficacy occurrence adverse event ) methadone hydrochloride first-line opioid treatment patient chronic neuropathic cancer pain . Secondary - To assess number time breakthrough analgesic usage . - To assess number episode breakthrough pain . - To assess total daily dose methadone hydrochloride . - To assess average pain score . - To determine safety adverse event profile methadone hydrochloride first-line opioid treatment chronic neuropathic cancer pain . - To assess frequency severity sleep disturbance associate use methadone hydrochloride . - To determine feasibility recruit patient chronic neuropathic cancer pain reasonable time frame future phase III study methadone hydrochloride v morphine . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients assign group accord average daily dosage morphine-equivalent 3 full day prior study entry ( ≤ 45 mg/day OR &gt; 45 ≤ 75 mg/day ) . Patients receive oral methadone hydrochloride various dos every 8 hour . Patients also may receive breakthrough oral methadone hydrochloride every 2 hour , need , 6 breakthrough analgesic per day . Treatment continue 35 day . Treatment stops patient well-controlled pain experience intolerable side effect . Patients complete Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire baseline . Patients rate pain accord question Brief Pain Inventory scale 0 ( pain ) 10 ( bad pain imaginable ) best describe pain worst last 24 hour , pain least last 24 hour , pain average , pain right ; record number time breakthrough analgesic usage , number episode breakthrough pain , total daily dose methadone hydrochloride ; complete nausea sleep assessment daily day 1-14 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 , 6-7 , 28 day .</detailed_description>
