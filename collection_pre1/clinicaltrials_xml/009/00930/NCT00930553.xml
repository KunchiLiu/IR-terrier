	<brief_summary>This open-label , rater-blinded extension study enroll patient relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) participate one three prior Genzyme-sponsored study alemtuzumab [ CAMMS223 ( NCT00050778 ) , CAMMS323 ( NCT00530348 ) also know CARE-MS I , CAMMS324 ( NCT00548405 ) also know CARE-MS II ] . The purpose study : 1 . To examine long term safety efficacy alemtuzumab treatment patient receive alemtuzumab study treatment one prior study . 2 . To examine safety efficacy initial alemtuzumab treatment study patient receive Rebif速 ( interferon beta-1a ) study treatment one prior study . 3 . To determine alemtuzumab treatment need , safety efficacy `` need '' treatment . This apply patient receive alemtuzumab first time one prior study first time extension study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Extension Protocol Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Participated Genzyme-Sponsored Studies Alemtuzumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alemtuzumab treatment either fix schedule two treatment cycle year apart patient receive Rebif速 one prior Genzyme-sponsored study alemtuzumab need schedule ( e.g . due document evidence resume MS activity ) patient already complete fixed schedule treatment alemtuzumab one prior Genzyme-sponsored study . There comparison treatment study . All patient require return study site every 3 month neurologic assessment . In addition , safety-related laboratory test survey perform least monthly . Participation extension study last 48 month enrollment . Study duration may extend per protocol amendment allow patient remain study time drug approval long term follow study available respective country .</detailed_description>
