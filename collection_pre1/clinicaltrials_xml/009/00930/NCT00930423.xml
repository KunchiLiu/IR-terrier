	<brief_summary>Atypical hemolytic uraemic syndrome cause defect regulate factor alternative pathway complement system . Triggering cause uncontrolled complement activation endothelial damage thrombotic micro-angiopathy , especially kidney . This result endstage renal failure . Complement activation hemodialysis describe result contact blood dialysis membrane . Our hypothesis patient atypical hemolytic uraemic syndrome stronger complement activation hemodialysis patient another underlie kidney disease . This could reason treat patient endstage renal failure due atypical hemolytic uraemic syndrome preferentially peritoneal dialysis instead hemodialysis .</brief_summary>
