	<brief_title>Evaluation Use Cap Improving Performance Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopic examination use clinical practice approximately 40 year . Despite fact colonoscopy widely available perform many experienced colonoscopists concern quality colonoscopy measure several technical endpoint rate fail caecal intubation polyp miss rate . A large population-based study reveal 13.1 % colonoscopy fail reach cecum . In addition , one large review back-to-back colonoscopy show polyp miss rate 24 % adenoma . One potentially promising technique cap-assisted colonoscopy . A transparent cap ( `` hood '' ) simple plastic device attach tip colonoscope perform colonoscopy . Several randomized trial Japan mix result regard improved cecal intubation time polyp detection rate . A recent large study Hong Kong show improved time cecum reduce polyp detection rate . To date large randomize study use cap western population , colorectal cancer ( CRC ) incidence know high . We plan conduct randomize controlled trial investigate usefulness cap-assisted colonoscopy Western population .</detailed_description>
