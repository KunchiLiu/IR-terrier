	<detailed_description>Adult patient psoriasis , especially young severe disease , increase prevalence myocardial infarction metabolic syndrome , increased mortality . Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) inflammatory cytokine felt play important role pathogenesis psoriasis psoriatic arthritis , pathogenesis metabolic syndrome increase cardiovascular mortality morbidity . However , prevalence metabolic syndrome surrogate marker increase cardiovascular risk , low flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) reactive hyperemia , measure high-resolution brachial artery ultrasound , low hyperemia-induced , pulse wave amplitude measure finger plethysmograph peripheral artery tonometry , elevate blood CRP level , child psoriasis , unknown . We use definition metabolic syndrome describe de Ferranti : Participants define metabolic syndrome meet exceed criterion 3 follow 5 variable : 1 ) triglyceride ≥1.1 mmol/L ; 2 ) HDL cholesterol &lt; 1.3 mmol/L ; 3 ) fast blood glucose ≥6.1 mmol/L ; 4 ) waist circumference ( cm ) &gt; 75th percentile age sex ; 5 ) systolic diastolic blood pressure ( mm Hg ) &gt; 90th percentile age , sex , height . The following two noninvasive procedure use assess additional cardiovascular risk : flow mediate dilation ( FMD ) finger plethysmography peripheral artery tonometry ( PAT ) . These procedure use extensively measure adult clinical study purpose many year . As control group , compare child psoriasis age- , race- , gender-matched child wart .</detailed_description>
