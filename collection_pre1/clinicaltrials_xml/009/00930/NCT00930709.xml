	<brief_title>Botulinum Toxin Versus Active Strength Training Treatment Lateral Epicondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Lateral epicondylitis ( tennis elbow ) frequent repetitive stress injury , affect common extensor muscle lateral humeral epicondyle . Lateral epicondylitis well-known spontaneous healing tendency . Still prevalence chronic lateral epicondylitis 1.4 % work population cause significant occupational disability financial burden . Systematic review effectiveness different treatment modality lateral epicondylitis present conflict result . There consistent guideline management prolonged lateral epicondylitis . Progressive strengthen stretching exercise well botulinum toxin type A injection suggest effective treatment chronic case . However , study compare different treatment modality botulinum toxin treatment include . The purpose study compare efficacy , feasibility cost effectiveness botulinum toxin type A injection active nine week strength train stretch program treatment chronic lateral epicondylitis . The main hypothesis botulinum toxin type A injection may enable rapid pain relief strength training may provide good functional result less relapse follow-up . SUBJECTS AND METHODS : A sample size 120 participant equal drop-out rate 15 % per group determine advance detect clinically significant 30 percentage point difference outcome measure treatment group minimum success rate 65 % statistical significance level 0.05 power 80 % . During recruitment process patient newly refer Department PM &amp; R outpatient clinic Sein√§joki Central Hospital due elbow pain evaluate study investigator . Every eligible patient write informed consent recruit . A computerised random number generator use draw allocation schedule . Patients allocate treatment group via opaque seal envelope mark accord random schedule . Measurements train instruction perform five trained physical therapist . In addition detailed personal training instruction give physical therapist , illustrate instruction well instruction video provide patient train group . Physical therapist instruct patient perform measurement enable blinding assessor . Measurement device calibrate regularly accord manufacturer ' recommendation quality assurance measurement test weight perform regular basis . The principal statistical analysis do intention-to-treat basis . Repeated measure ANCOVA Cox Proportional Hazard Regression plan use primary method . If relapse , advance longitudinal model Generalised Estimating Equations Random Coefficient Analysis use .</detailed_description>
