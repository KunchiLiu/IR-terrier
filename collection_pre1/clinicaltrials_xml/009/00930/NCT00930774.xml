	<brief_summary>Many soldier return recent service Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom ( OIF/OEF ) expose blast combat . About 60 % blast-injured soldier diagnose traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , approximately 18 % mild TBI ( mTBI ) . mTBI associate many symptom , include memory problem , headache , difficulty concentrating , increase anxiety , , especially relevant , report difficulty understand speech noisy environment and/or people speak rapidly . While problem understand rapid speech speech noise associate hearing loss , many OIF/OEF veteran complaint clinically normal hearing . Although physical damage ear , veteran ' hearing problem negative impact quality-of-life functioning . Thus incumbent upon VA examine intervention approach veterans normal/near-normal auditory sensitivity significant complaint difficulty hearing . Currently , standard-of-care veteran provide information hearing , hear conservation , use communication strategy . Two form rehabilitation likely effective informational-counseling approach : ( 1 ) use personal miniaturized Frequency modulation ( FM ) system , ( 2 ) provision auditory training Posit Science Brain Fitness Program ( BFP ) . Personal FM system increase loudness speech signal relative unwanted noise , BFP train improves ability listen take advantage brain 's ability change ( i.e. , neural plasticity ) . In study veteran randomly select receive one four treatment : ( 1 ) FM use alone , ( 2 ) BFP train alone , ( 3 ) FM+BFP training combine , ( 4 ) informational-counseling . The effectiveness intervention compare use self-report hearing function standard questionnaire . Results contribute development evidence-based intervention approach blast-exposed veteran report functional hearing difficulty normal/near-normal auditory sensitivity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The long-term goal study develop evidence-based auditory rehabilitation veteran normal/near-normal peripheral auditory function significant complaint difficulty hear . Many veteran OIF/OEF conflict expose blast - common wound etiology conflict . Approximately 18 % blast-injured veteran diagnose mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) . mTBI result post-concussive symptom memory problem , difficulty concentrating , increase anxiety , functional hearing difficulty presence clinically-normal hearing sensitivity . Currently standard-of-care auditory rehabilitation veteran normal/near-normal auditory sensitivity complaint difficulty hearing . At minimum , VA recommend provision information auditory system , hear conservation use communication strategy . Two intervention likely efficacious : ( 1 ) use personal FM ( frequency modulation ) system , and/or ( 2 ) auditory training . FM system effective manage auditory problem child normal/near normal peripheral hearing . FM system substantially improve signal-to-noise ratio speech noisy reverberant environment , theoretically make resource available high level processing . Auditory training take advantage neural plasticity . The Posit Science Brain Fitness Program ( BFP ) auditory train program adult improve temporal processing work memory old adult . Combining use FM system auditory train show improve speech understanding decrease report hearing ability among adults sensorineural hearing loss functional hearing complaint . No study systemically examine relative efficacy FM use and/or auditory training veteran mTBI normal/almost normal hear sensitivity . The effectiveness two intervention strategy examine study between-subjects randomize control clinical trial compare outcome : ( 1 ) FM use alone , ( 2 ) BFP alone , ( 3 ) FM+BFP combine . All group also receive informational-counseling , ( 4 ) control group . Outcomes measure subjectively self-report auditory competence . The result study help determine whether use FM system auditory training , either alone combine , efficacious intervention blast-exposed veteran report functional hearing difficulty normal/near-normal auditory sensitivity . Results contribute development evidence-based auditory rehabilitation veteran , move VA closer fulfil goal provide excellence patient care , veteran ' benefit customer satisfaction .</detailed_description>
