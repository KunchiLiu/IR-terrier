	<brief_title>Omega-3-Fatty Acid Joint Symptoms Inducted Aromatase Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There data regard use supplement type musculoskeletal pain discomfort , namely AI induce joint pain joint stiffness . Given lack effective treatment AI induce joint pain/ stiffness safety efficacy omega 3 fatty acid musculoskeletal pain , therefore reasonable test efficacy dietary supplement population postmenopausal breast cancer patient experience joint pain related aromatase inhibitor . Since woman hormone receptor positive breast cancer require long term hormonal therapy , important objective minimizing long term side effect enhance patient compliance improve quality life .</detailed_description>
