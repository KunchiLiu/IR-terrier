	<brief_title>Safety Study Evaluate KW-2450 Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , sequential , ascend , multi-dose , Phase 1 study enroll 72 subject previously treat advanced solid tumor . Subjects dose level receive KW-2450 orally , daily 28 day follow 1-week observation period . After complete 1 week observation period , subject receive KW-2450 continuous daily schedule . All dose KW-2450 administered subject overnight fast condition . Dose escalation may proceed &gt; = 3 subject complete Day 29 blood sample evaluate glucose . The safety dose level establish prior enrollment subject next dose level . Dose escalation proceed sequentially accelerate titration . Once criteria complete accelerated titration reach , dose escalation follow modify Fibonacci schedule . Up 6 subject enrol dose level . Enrollment proceed maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) establish high dose level ( 800 mg/day ) reach .</detailed_description>
