	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular mortality major cause death end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Therefore , identification coronary artery disease ( CAD ) ESRD important task nephrologists . Coronary angiography gold standard detect extent severity coronary atherosclerosis . It necessary determine whether coronary angiography , invasive contrast use procedure , perform high-risk individual whether noninvasive testing could reliably identify patient critical coronary lesion . The coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) uremic patient undergoing hemodialysis reflect severity atherosclerotic vascular disease predict cardiovascular event . Recent study chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient show significant incidence rapid progression rate CAC . Coronary electron-beam computerized tomography ( EBCT ) could use screen test identify cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) CKD patient . In coronary artery disease , leave ventricular diastolic dysfunction find correlate reduced coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) patient hypertension leave ventricular hypertrophy . This show patient vascular calcification , CFR measurement trans-thoracic Doppler echocardiography ( TTDE ) non-invasive easy test usage advantage risk stratification . CFR represent capacity coronary circulation dilate follow increase myocardial metabolic demand . By use method , impairment CFR assess development angiographically detectable stenosis epicardial coronary artery able investigate early coronary microvasculature pathology . The aim cross-sectional study , determine correlation CAC measure EBCT CFR measure TTDE . We also assess carotid artery parameter measure intima medium thickness accurately describe process arterial wall change due atherosclerosis . Possible association CFR inflammation arterial calcification also evaluate .</detailed_description>
