	<brief_title>Anti-Hormone Therapy ( With Anastrazole Fulvestrant ) Before Surgery Treat Postmenopausal Women With Breast Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hormonal therapy generally prefer treatment breast cancer minimal side effect . Hormone receptor positive breast cancer generally respond well chemotherapy , many side effect . Hormonal therapy single drug Anastrozole main type treatment use reduce risk cancer recurrence . Whether combination Anastrazole nad Fulvestrant effective feasible know . This study do answer question . This phase II single arm study . Patients Oncotype Dx perform recurrence score low intermediate , would eligible . Eligible patient receive Anastrazole Fulvestrant 16 week . Subjects receive Anastrazole 1 mg po q day Fulvestrant 500 mg IM , day 1 , day 14 , day 28 thereafter every 28 day outpatient basis . On day 28 , subject evaluate side effect clinically needle core biopsy ( optional ) obtain . If increase Ki 67 50 % , subject take study . Response evaluation occur every 28 day outpatient clinic visit . All treatment continue 4 month patient undergo surgical intervention . After surgery , patient study receive additional breast cancer therapy discretion treat physician . Patients develop progressive disease protocol remove study treat discretion treat physician . The protocol close last accrued patient surgery .</detailed_description>
