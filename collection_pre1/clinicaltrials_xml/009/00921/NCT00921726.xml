	<detailed_description>It likely influenza pandemic , intravenous zanamivir use combination oseltamivir . Although potential drug interaction two drug low , likelihood coadministration combine common route renal clearance drug current lack information organic anion transporter polypeptide ( OATP ) inhibition potential zanamivir vivo warrant verification lack interaction . This study provide clinical guidance use intravenous zanamivir setting oral oseltamivir commonly use , area human case H5N1 report . The total duration study participation approximately 13 week . Each participant screen visit , four treatment step , follow-up visit . The screen visit determine enrollment eligibility conduct within 45 day prior receive first dose . Participants randomize receive either Regimen A B Step 1 . Participants receive Regimen A receive Regimen B Step 2 vice versa . After complete Step 2 , participant continue Regimens C D , consecutively , Steps 3 4 , least 3 day step . A follow-up visit occur 7-10 day complete last treatment assessment withdraw study . Regimen A consists continuous intravenous zanamivir infusion ( 800 mg ) 16 hour . Regimen B consist 150 mg oral oseltamivir tablet take five time 3 day . Regimen C consist 150 mg oral oseltamivir tablet take five time 3 day plus continuous intravenous zanamivir infusion ( 3600 mg ) 36 hour . Regimen D consist 150 mg oral oseltamivir tablet take five time 3 day plus intermittent intravenous zanamivir infusion receive five 30 minute interval ( 3000 mg total ) . Blood urine collection , vital sign , pharmacokinetic sampling , adverse event assessment , pregnancy test female occur step study . The follow-up visit involve blood urine collection , vital sign , adverse event assessment , pregnancy test female .</detailed_description>
