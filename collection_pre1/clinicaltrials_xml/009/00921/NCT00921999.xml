	<brief_summary>Background : - The common varicella-zoster virus cause chickenpox shingle . Both disease cause rash , also complications bacterial infection skin , pneumonia , eye disease . - By draw study blood sample people infect varicella-zoster virus receive receive varicella vaccine , researcher hope learn immune system response virus . Objectives : - To determine immune system response varicella virus , either exist form give part vaccine . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old receive varicella vaccine . - Individuals 5 year age old currently chickenpox shingle . Design : - Participants visit NIH Clinical Center initial physical examination , provide blood sample evaluation . - Researchers determine number sample take amount blood drawn need base participant medical history exposure varicella-zoster virus . Investigators study give subject either chickenpox shingle vaccine . They look response vaccine person receive receive vaccine health care provider .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) cause chickenpox ( varicella ) shingle ( zoster ) . Antibody important control varicella evidence role varicella immune globulin limit severity disease immunocompromised person . Limited information available regard individual viral protein antibody produce primary infection VZV vaccination . Furthermore , commercially available test determine seropositivity VZV vaccination limit sensitivity , improve assay need . We obtain blood person varicella , zoster , vaccinate varicella ( zoster ) vaccine NIH Clinical Center measure immune response specific viral protein , look virus blood , case measure immune response cellular protein time . Elucidation response might help develop sensitive assay VZV seropositivity vaccination determine varicella vaccine protect varicella .</detailed_description>
