	<brief_title>Long-term Examination Titanium Dental Implants With TPS Surface : A Prospective 20-year Case Series Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The rehabilitation implant-supported restoration successful treatment modality fully partially edentulous patient since early 1980s . Today , partially edentulous individual become main group patient consider implant therapy , several report publish show favorable long-term outcome different dental implant system . In systematic review analyze long-term performance osseointegrated implant , clinical study 5-year observation period frequently include . However , study 10-year observation period sparse . Only three clinical study observation period 20-years edentulous partially edentulous patient find . Objective : The objective evaluate dental implant 20 year function . Methods : Partially edentulous patient provide implant 1986 1989 Department Oral Surgery Stomatology University Bern recruit clinical radiographic evaluation 20 year implant installation . A total 75 patient 102 implant recall clinical radiographic examination . All implant instal hollow screw hollow cylinder implant ( Straumann , Waldenburg , Switzerland ) rough TPS surface . They place accord manufacturer 's guideline . The superstructure consistent single crown fix partial denture , incorporate 4-6 month postsurgically . All patient evaluate use information patient 's chart 20-year examination . Apical radiograph take implant adjacent tooth . The marginal bone level around adjacent tooth also calculate use implant shoulder reference point .</detailed_description>
