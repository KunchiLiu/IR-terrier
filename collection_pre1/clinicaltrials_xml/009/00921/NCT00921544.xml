	<brief_summary>Retinopathy Prematurity ( ROP ) screen one many potentially painful diagnostic therapeutic procedure perform routinely preterm infant Neonatal Intensive Care Unit . Therefore strategy stress reduction pain management essential promote growth development minimize long-term sequela . Procedural analgesia include concept developmental care , non nutritive suck ( NNS ) , pharmacological non-pharmacological agent . Sucrose think stimulate body 's activation lingual sweet taste receptor release endogenous opioids , combine NNS , non-opioid mechanism also activate . The administration sucrose combination sucrose non-nutritive suck one frequently study non-pharmacological intervention relief pain neonates oral sucrose show effective safe therapy common neonatal procedure heal lance , blood-letting venepuncture . There conflict evidence benefit sucrose ROP screening . Therefore purpose study determine efficacy sucrose combine NNS potential regime reduction pain associate retinopathy prematurity screening .</brief_summary>
