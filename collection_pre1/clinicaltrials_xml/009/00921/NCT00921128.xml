	<brief_summary>Background : - Parkinson disease ( PD ) progressive neurodegenerative disorder affect brain cell make chemical dopamine . The primary medical treatment PD use medication replace dopamine miss brain . These medication effective first , many year side effect tolerance develop . - Surgery treat basic PD symptom complication . Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) offer safer alternative therapy adjust reversed minimize side effect optimize beneficial effect . DBS treat symptom PD alter course . - Infusions neurochemical medication another PD treatment method . NIH researcher develop technique convection-enhanced delivery , precisely consistently deliver infusion many type brain . This project allow researcher infuse medication , Muscimol , subthalamic region brain see safe effective DBS . Objectives : - To determine whether infusion Muscimol brain safe relieve symptom Parkinson disease . - To demonstrate infusion monitor magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use gadolinium . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old Parkinson disease prepare bilateral subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) DBS surgery . - Patients divide two group . One group patient partial infusion Muscimol STN , second group patient complete infusion Muscimol STN . Design : - This study begin 5 day patient undergoes bilateral subthalamic DBS surgery . - On Day 1 study , small thin tube ( microcatheters ) insert STN incision burr hole use DBS . Two infusion study Muscimol perform successive day : first without PD medication ( Day 3 study ) second PD medication ( Day 4 study ) . - Each infusion monitor MRI suite , researcher perform clinical examination patient PD symptom . - Following study experiment , second surgery perform remove microcatheters place DBS electrodes standard fashion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective pilot study gain insight safety , feasibility clinical effect infusion temporary act GABAA agonist ( muscimol ) convection-enhanced delivery subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) Parkinson disease ( PD ) patient undergo deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) surgery . Study population : Eight adult male female patient medically-intractable PD prepare undergo DBS surgery meet Inclusion Exclusion Criteria enrol . Six subject treat ( 2 may screen failure ) . Design : We propose single center pilot study infusion muscimol bilateral STN PD patient undergo DBS . Subjects enrol 1 2 cohort . Both cohort contain 3 patient ( total 6 patient ) . Patients cohorts undergo pre- , intra- post-operative PD assessment . The first cohort undergo bilateral perfusion half volume ( infusion 8 microliters ) STN muscimol ( 8.8 mM ) gadolinium-DTPA ( [ 1 mM ] medication state sequential day ) . The second cohort undergo bilateral perfusion entire volume ( infusion 16 microliters ) STN muscimol ( 8.8 mM ) gadolinium-DTPA ( [ 1 mM ] medication state sequential day ) . Distribution muscimol use surrogate image tracer ( gadolinium-DPTA ) track use real-time MR-imaging correlate clinical effect . After infusion complete , catheter remove patient undergo placement bilateral STN DBS . Patients evaluate use standard PD rating scale determine effect STN neuronal suppression compare effect muscimol pharmacologic neuronal suppression DBS effect . Outcome measure : To determine distribution muscimol STN provide anatomic correlate clinical effect neuronal suppression , real-time 3D-volumetric MR-imaging use infusion . To assess safety , tolerability clinical effect muscimol infusion , standard PD rating scale ( motor subsection Unified PD Rating Scale , timed-up-and-go gait assessment peg board bradykinesia test ) perform follow infusion correlate real-time infusion MR-imaging study . To compare effect muscimol infusion STN DBS , assessment obtain infusion compare similar assessment 6 month DBS placement .</detailed_description>
