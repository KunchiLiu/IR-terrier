	<brief_summary>There suggestive evidence vitamin C vitamin D deficiency may increase blood pressure across range blood pressure normal elevate . Information relationship inadequate part rarity individual subclinical vitamin C D deficiency . The investigator observe subnormal deficient plasma vitamin C 25-hydroxyvitamin D level large proportion patient active treatment investigator ' hospital . The clinical implication widespread hypovitaminosis C D unknown . In randomized prospective comparison trial investigator measure vitamin level blood pressure clinically stable acutely hospitalized patient wide range diagnosis , expect remain hospital least 7 day . The investigator examine inverse relationship baseline vitamin level blood pressure across range blood pressure . Consenting patient randomize receive vitamin C ( 500 mg twice daily ) vitamin D ( 1000 IU twice daily ) long 10 day . Blood pressure re-measured every 2 day vitamin level re-measured last study day . Treatment course least 5 day consider sufficient analysis . The hypothesis either treatment reduce blood pressure patient whose baseline systolic blood pressure 110 ; investigator also examine whether reduction blood pressure treatment proportional increase circulate vitamin level treatment .</brief_summary>
