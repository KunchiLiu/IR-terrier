	<brief_summary>This study aim determine infrared spectroscopy compare continuous compartment pressure monitor detection compartment syndrome . Individuals meet study eligibility criterion identify time admission receive Trauma Orthopaedics Registrar train study design protocol . Eligible individual approach participate study either time admission shortly afterwards , either chief investigator another doctor train research protocol . Where individual unconscious otherwise incapacitate , likely many major trauma victim , inclusion study discuss patient 's legal representative and/or family . The consent process study consist study protocol explain either chief investigator , another doctor train study design . Patients allow read participant information sheet , permit much time require decide wish participate study . Verbal write consent take use study specific consent form . In case incapacitated patient , study design explain relative ' legal representative appropriate advice seek whether know reason patient might object participate study . Upon regain capacity consent seek patient storage analysis study data . Once consent , patient undergo monitoring continuous compartment pressure , NIRS measurement . Recordings technique take hour , part patient normal observation , point consent 24 hour first operation . Where patient operation total duration monitor 24 hour . The measurement take nursing staff receive training technique . The procedure technique describe : 1 . Continuous compartment pressure record broken leg , case tibial fracture , patient fit inclusion criterion measurement take leg ( legs risk compartment syndrome ) . Compartment pressure record use slit catheter technique . Insertion slit catheter perform either chief investigator Orthopaedic Registrar train technique . The slit catheter insert use sterile technique - skin front outer part leg clean catheter insert anterior muscle compartment point . The catheter sit approximate midpoint leg , although adjust would lead insertion fracture site . The catheter secure sterile dress connect monitor recording take , catheter leave place duration study need re-site unless stop record accurately . At time compartment pressure measurement take patient 's blood pressure monitor 'Perfusion Pressure ' leg calculate , : Perfusion pressure = diastolic blood pressure - leg compartment pressure 2 . NIRS measurement take INVOS system , produce Somentics . These measurement take leg , affect leg leg use control comparison . Where legs risk measurement take legs midpoint forearm use control . The INVOS probe small adhesive patch stuck skin . The probe sterile attach use sterile technique compartment pressure catheter . Where overlie skin hairy hair overlie area probe clip attach probe , ensure adequate adhesion accurate reading . The probe sit compartment pressure catheter , although underlying haematoma ( blood clot ) , probe position avoid still remain front out part leg . This technique conform manufacturer recommend use equipment similar protocol previous study . At end monitoring period measure device remove . If patient develop compartment syndrome period require operation , NIRS probe compartment pressure catheter replace 12 hour monitor monitor change post-operatively ensure compartment pressure stay low .</brief_summary>
