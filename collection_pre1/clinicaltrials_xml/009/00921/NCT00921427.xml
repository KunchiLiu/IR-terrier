	<brief_title>The Use Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( TDCS ) Enhance Rehabilitative Effect Vision Restoration Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim study improve recovery visual function brain injury . A prominent theme current neuroscience research regard sequelae brain injury posit activity-dependent plasticity underlies neuro-recovery . If case , good reason believe neurological change underling recovery facilitate establish mean enhance cortical activity . Studies suggest alter cortical excitability may prime prepare cortex subsequent training furthermore , may improve overall functional outcome ( Webster et al , 2006 ; Brown &amp; Pilitsis , 2006 ; Khedr et al , 2005 ) . The work hypothesis pilot study computer-based visual rehabilitative training ( use NovaVision 's Vision Restoration TherapyTM ; `` VRT '' software ) enhance visual function ( defined increase functional visual field ) reinforce synaptic connection within sensory network visual cortex associate visual field loss ( Kasten et al. , 1998 ; Sabel , 1999 ) . Potentially , reinforcement enhance concurrent transcranial direct current stimulation ( TDCS ) lead turn , enhance visual performance ( quantified extent visual field measure visual perimetry allow direct statistical comparison visual field change time individual basis ) patient partial complete hemianopic visual field loss cause brain injury . Both computer base visual rehabilitative training TDCS establish technique novel approach aim provide preliminary data regard safety efficacy combine intervention . We expect result study provide objective basis large , formal randomize control study combine two therapy . Our long term goal maximize benefit modern vision rehabilitative therapy , lay groundwork neurophysiological correlate associate recovery visual function follow brain injury propose possible refinement future neurorehabilitation strategy . Data collaborator Columbia University Medical Center well others indicate 6 month course treatment therapy VRT lead dramatic improvement visual function ( quantified increase functional visual field ) ( Kasten et al. , 1998 ; Kasten et al. , 2006 ) . TDCS well known bring transient positive change functional well electrophysiological measure cortical brain function . If overall visual function enhance via combine synergetic effect VRT TDCS , conduct large randomize control study . If enhancement effect combine TDCS VRT , need reconsider factor case . For example , lack enhancement effect could relate patient selection include degree profoundness vision loss prior treatment , age individual duration insult , well level motivation participate computer-based training program . Other consideration include long combined treatment duration . The loss visual function follow brain injury highly debilitate individual . Typically , damage occipital cortex optic radiation follow brain lesion trauma lead loss visual function visuotopically corresponding part visual field spar remain area ( e.g . half visual field case hemianopia ) . This partial blindness loss visual function generally consider untreatable due fact highly specific neuronal organization underlie normal visual function determine early development regenerative particularly `` critical period '' development reach . More recent evidence ( include laboratory ) demonstrate considerable degree plasticity reorganization visual system occur cerebral damage also adulthood , , well critical period development occur . For example , evidence spontaneous post-lesion neuroplasticity demonstrate adult visual system document extensive receptive field reorganization follow lesion retina visual cortex ( e.g . Kass 1990 ) . Computer-based training strategy develop train rehabilitate various cerebral function language learn deficit . Computer-based training also extensively studied treatment partial blindness adult brain-injured patient ( Kasten et al. , 1998 ; Sabel Trauzettel-Klosinksi , 2005 ; Sabel et al. , 2005 ) . However , neurophysiological mechanism underlie report beneficial effect follow VRT remain poorly understood . One important issue restoration visual field function result localize neuroplastic change cortical circuitry within visual cortex , one posit modulation cortical excitability turn influence degree restorative effect . More specifically , increase level overall cortical excitability visual cortex potentiate synaptic neuroplastic interaction thus translate improve visual functional gain . Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( TDCS ) represent noninvasive method brain stimulation could potentially modulate effect . TDCS utilizes low amplitude direct current apply via scalp electrode inject current brain thus modulate level excitability . Direct Current ( DC ) stimulation use various form since inception modern electrophysiology begin nineteenth century . There recent upsurge interest TDCS tool neuroscience research well assessment treatment modality various neurological neuropsychiatric disorder include depression , Parkinsonism , stroke recovery , chronic neuropathic pain . TDCS distinct advantage inexpensive , easy administer , noninvasive painless . We extensive experience TDCS currently run parallel study . We wish extend principle visual rehabilitation domain . VRT : Computer-based training strategy develop train rehabilitate adult brain-injured patient partial visual loss due brain damage ( Kasten et al. , 1998 ; Sabel Trauzettel-Klosinksi , 2005 ; Sabel et al. , 2005 ) . Vision restoration therapy ( VRT ) involve identify stimulate region visual field partly damage brain injury trauma . Patients receive customized program design visual field deficit use home daily . Through specific pattern visual stimulus gauge user 's ability identify react , user gradually expand visual field restore lose vision . The training do home front computer-based device , usually 30-minute session , twice day . During training , hundred visual stimulation present monitor area residual vision . It propose repetitive stimulation damage visual area lead neuroplastic change alter nerve activity relate vision , strengthen synaptic interaction help restore person 's visual function . Work Sabel colleague report finding fifteen patient underwent six 12 month VRT ( Kasten et al. , 2006 ) . Visual field assessment perform VRT repeat average 46 month complete VRT . After six month VRT , sample stimulus detection increase significantly 54 % 63 % . The number undetected stimulus decrease significantly eye . Continuing VRT 12 month improve result achieve six month . The follow-up examination therapy-free interval three year show benefit VRT remain stable , vision loss occur instance . According study , patient vision loss brain injury benefit regardless severity lesion much vision affect . Furthermore , large area residual vision , good outcome VRT . It clear VRT vary result . In study , one-third patient study little effect VRT , one-third moderate noticeable improvement , one-third strong dramatic improvement . Patient compliance VRT report good . NovaVision VRTâ„¢ first FDA-cleared medical device rehabilitative therapy clinically proven improve visual field defect brain injury survivor become leave partially blind due condition . In on-going multi-center trial sponsor NovaVision , 70 % study participant 16 U.S. center underwent six-module ( six month ) course therapy show three percent great improvement stimulus detection visual field test . The average improvement stimulus detection 12 percent . Previous study suggest people regain three percent visual field functional improvement may include enhanced quality life well reading performance , watch television playing sport , although functional outcome measure study . These result present 2007 Academy Neurology meet Boston , MA . TDCS : Transcranial direct current stimulation ( TDCS ) use several decade . Numerous human clinical animal study demonstrate technique able modulate neuronal activity function delivery polarize current apply surface brain . Surface anodal polarization cortex increase spontaneous neuronal activity , whereas cathodal polarization generally depress neuronal activity ( Creutzfeld et al. , 1962 ) . Recent human study demonstrate stimulation TDCS change motor cortex excitability accord stimulation polarity : whereas anodal stimulation increase cortical excitability , cathodal stimulation decrease ( Nitsche et al. , 2003a b ) . Moreover , clinical therapeutic point view , effect TDCS appear long-standing . For example , 13 minute TDCS show modulate cortical excitability last 2 hour follow stimulation period ( Nitsche Paulus , 2001 ) . Two recent study ( include one co-investigator list ) explore effect TDCS motor function stroke patient show modulatory effect TDCS use improve motor function ( Fregni et al. , 2005a ; Hummel et al. , 2005a b ) . Interestingly , similar modulatory effect also describe visual cortex ( Antal et al. , 2001 ; Antal et al. , 2004 ) lead support notion activity within visual cortical area modulate turn lead behavioral change . TDCS modulate excitability target brain region non-invasively alter neuronal membrane potential ( Bindman et al . 1962 ; Purpura &amp; McMurtry , 1965 ) . Thus , technique use increase decrease excitability neuron target brain area establish causal relation give region brain specific sensory , motor cognitive function . Unlike Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) , TDCS depolarize neuron cause fire . TDCS alters likelihood neuron fire depolarize hyperpolarizing brain tissue ( depend stimulation parameter use ) . The neurophysiological basis TDCS attribute mechanism akin long-term potentiation ( LTP ) long-term depression ( LTD ) ( Hattori et al . 1990 ; Moriwaki , 1991 ; Islam et al . 1995 ) . Certain medication dextromethorphan ( NMDA antagonist ) suppress post-TDCS stimulation effect anodal cathodal stimulation strongly suggest involvement NMDA receptor type DC-induced neuroplasticity . In contrast , Carbamazepine selectively eliminate anodal effect . Since Carbamazepine stabilize membrane potential voltage-dependently , result reveal after-effects anodal TDCS require depolarization membrane potential ( Liebetanz et al. , 2002 ) . This study Liebetanz et al. , ( 2002 ) provide pharmacological evidence induction after-effects TDCS require combination glutamatergic ( excitatory ) membrane mechanism , similar induction establish type short- long-term neuroplasticity . In animal , anodal cortical stimulation 5-30 minute show cause excitability increase lasting hour stimulation , primarily modulation rest membrane potential ( Terzuolo &amp; Bullock , 1956 ; Creutzfeldt et al . 1962 ; Eccles et al . 1962 ; Bindman et al . 1964 ; Purpura &amp; McMurtry , 1965 ; Artola et al . 1990 ; Malenka &amp; Nicoll , 1999 ) . In human , 13 min TDCS result increase excitability 150 % last 90 min ( Nitsche &amp; Paulus , 2001 ) . Research TDCS reveal anodal stimulation induce transient ( order 30 minute ) improvement performance cognitive , motor linguistic task . For example , Hummel et al . ( 2005a , b ) find anodal TDCS deliver primary motor area lesion hemisphere elicit significant improvement motor control paretic limb . The effect last 25 minute stimulation . In recent study , Fregni et al ( 2005a ) also verify anodal TDCS affect hemisphere cathodal TDCS contralesional hemisphere improve motor function . Other example highlight efficacy anodal TDCS include Fregni et al . ( 2005b ) - anodal TDCS dorsolateral prefrontal cortex elicit improvement work memory ; Nitsche et al . ( 2003a ) - stimulation primary motor cortex improve motor learning ; Antal et al . ( 2004 ) - TDCS deliver primary motor area visual area V5 induce improvement visuo-motor coordination ; Kincses et al . ( 2004 ) - anodal stimulation fronto-polar region improve probabilistic classification learning ; Lyer et al . ( 2005 ) - leave prefrontal cortical stimulation lead increase verbal fluency . These study attest efficacy safety TDCS brain injury patient , well potential therapeutic application brain lesion recovery . In summary , propose conduct pilot experiment test whether visual function in-patients hemianopic field loss cause brain injury improve combine transcranial direct stimulation computer base vision training . We hypothesize computer base vision train reinforce visual cortical network prim concurrent transcranial direct current stimulation ( TDCS ) lead improve visual performance . The BIDMC investigator responsible TDCS application VRT , well associate data process / interpretation .</detailed_description>
