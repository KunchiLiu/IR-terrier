	<detailed_description>Puberty time foundation lay healthy bone mass . Over course puberty , 26 % bone mass establish 4-year period peak height velocity 60 % adult peak bone mass establish . Factors affect normal bone mineralization include calcium intake , vitamin D status , degree physical weight bearing activity , hormone , genetics , body weight , general health nutrition status . HIV-infected child , youth , adult low bone mineral density ( BMD ) would expect healthy people similar age , weight , race . As majority perinatally HIV-infected U.S. child enter adolescence , potential HIV-related impaired BMD adolescent peak bone mass acquisition particular concern . The purpose study compare change BMD lumbar spine pre-treatment level 24 48 week alendronate treatment placebo HIV-infected child adolescent . Participants randomize equally one three group : Group 1A receive alendronate 96 week ; Group 1B receive alendronate 48 week follow placebo 48 week ; Group 2 receive placebo 48 week follow alendronate 48 week . All three group follow treatment additional 48 week . Participants also receive vitamin D/calcium duration study ask perform 60 minute weight-bearing exercise day . Clinic visit schedule every 12 week entry , telephone contact visit one , four , 28 week entry week 48 visit . A physical exam dental assessment conduct clinic visit , history adverse event collect . Dual Energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) , hematology chemistry panel conduct entry week 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 144 . Lumbar spine whole body ( head ) BMD measure use Hologic DXA scanner ( QDR4500A , QDR4500W Delphi A model ) . The primary analysis compare change entry 24 48 week lumbar spine BMD Groups 1A 1B combine ( alendronate initial 48 week ) vs. Group 2 ( placebo 48 week ) . Study participant unblinded 96 week follow-up ( primary completion date ) remain study , study treatment , additional 48 week . This initial submission result include follow-up 48 week . Results secondary clinical outcome measure 48 week enter late time point . Secondary laboratory outcome list protocol ( bone marker turnover Receptor Activator Nuclear Factor Kappa-B Ligand/Osteoprotegerin ( RANKL/OPG ) Ratio ) central fat content , require application additional funding laboratory testing , perform result available .</detailed_description>
