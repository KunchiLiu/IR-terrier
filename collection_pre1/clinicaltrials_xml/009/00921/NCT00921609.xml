	<brief_summary>Acromegaly rare disorder characterize excessive production growth hormone often pituitary adenoma . A pituitary adenoma tumor , almost always benign non-cancerous , grow pituitary , small gland locate base brain . Treatment acromegaly usually involve surgery , medication , radiation , involve combination three treatment . Subjects study recruit : 1 . Adults , male female , age 18-90 . 2 . Have diagnose acromegaly , base elevated level growth hormone , IGF-I ( hormone make response growth hormone ) , pituitary adenoma visualize MRI . 3 . Patients would already agree acromegaly treat surgery prior study entry . Subjects measurement growth hormone use oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , IGF-I , free IGF-I level IGF bind protein four time point pituitary surgery : Day 1 , Day 42 ( 6 week ) , Day 84 ( 12 week ) , day 365 ( 1 year ) . Subjects also MRI pituitary do 12 week 1 year . OGTT IGF-I routinely measure ass whether person cure acromegaly . An MRI pituitary routinely do 12 week 1 year surgery ass result surgery . Free IGF-I IGF binding protein routinely measure surgery , do see relate strongly disease activity IGF-I growth hormone . OGTT IGF-I binding protein routinely measure day surgery , do examine predictive ability test early time surgery . Data obtain test compare data gather 1 year time point . IGF-I growth hormone measure commercial clinical lab , Quest Diagnostics , clinical decision-making time service . IGF-I growth hormone also measure use method attempt investigate variability hormone different assay use .</brief_summary>
