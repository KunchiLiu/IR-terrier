	<brief_title>Evaluation Radiation Therapy Positioning System ( RTPS ) Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The high precision plan radiotherapy treatment require accurate position prostate order ensure tightly conform dose distribution miss prostate result either significant tumor underdosage , increase dose rectum bladder , . Precise delivery addressed use variety pre-treatment localization system . The direct localization prostate involve use ultrasound , compute tomography ( CT ) , radiography permanently implant fiducial marker . In study safety performance novel investigational tracking system evaluate . The Radiation Therapy Positioning System ( RTPS ) radioactive track system integrated radiotherapy set-up workflow . The System compose Clinical Positioning System ( CPS ) radioactive soft tissue implant fiducial ( Blip ) , permanently implant prostate . By track implanted Blip , CPS monitor positional change prior treatment . The accuracy RTPS localization compare CBCT least 5 radiation therapy session per patient .</detailed_description>
