	<brief_summary>Two common aging-related disease older adult Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) cataract . In elderly adult , two disease frequently occur person . Although cure AD currently unavailable , cataract effectively treat surgery people . The removal cataracts document benefit visual performance reduce accident fall . However , experience ophthalmologist , others field , patient , caregiver , primary care doctor reluctant proceed cataract surgery individual give diagnosis AD . It think cataract surgery improve AD patient 's quality life , vision , cognition . The investigator design study determine whether true .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In project , propose test follow clinical hypothesis , address primary two secondary Specific Aims : Hypothesis : Cataract removal produce measurable benefit vision , perception , independent function , quality life patient co-morbid Alzheimer 's disease . Primary Specific Aim : To determine effect cataract removal visual acuity , spatial contrast sensitivity , vision dependent function , visual information processing , quality life patient Alzheimer 's disease . Secondary Specific Aims . 1 . To delineate baseline characteristic patient benefit surgical intervention . 2 . To assess thickness retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) large sample AD patient classify mild moderate dementia determine thickness RNFL associate dementia severity , visual performance measure , patient characteristic . The study design Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) two cohort AD patient longitudinal investigation . Each person evaluate periodically 6 month period . All participant diagnose visually significant bilateral cataractous lens . The cohort establish randomly assign patient either immediate ( optional ) delay surgery group . Patients stratify AD severity ( CDR mild moderate ) cataract severity prior randomize . Comparisons within group test change time vision , visual information processing , quality life associate without removal cataract . The RNFL thickness person evaluate optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . The thickness RNFL compare across dementia severity level . Each consent participant consenting study partner may refer Research Partner , often participant 's caregiver . The latter help assure protocol adherence AD participant provide information behavioral symptom , activity daily live , amount resource use . The study demonstrate clinical efficacy cataract removal direct intervention potentially improve visual cognitive function , quality life person diagnose AD .</detailed_description>
