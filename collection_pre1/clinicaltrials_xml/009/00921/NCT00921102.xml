	<brief_title>Atropine Prevent Nausea Vomiting After Spinal Anesthesia Caesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrathecal ( IT ) morphine grant effective , durable safe analgesia Caesarean section . The common adverse effect IT morphine widespread pruritus postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) . Postoperative nausea vomit multifactorial origin ; addition general pre-existing risk factor , elevate gonadotropin progesterone serum level , parturients undergo Caesarean section expose drug-induced , hemodynamic surgical ( manipulation uterus ) stimulus . Anticholinergic agent , particularly scopolamine , long know decrease opioid-related nausea vomiting , although narrow therapeutic range inconvenient route administration ( typically transdermal ) limited application . Anticholinergic agent think act via inhibition muscarinic receptor several region medulla oblongata , implicate nausea vomit generation ; addition chemoceptor trigger zone , receptor particularly concentrate , limited nucleus tractus solitarius . Cholinergic receptor typically associate motion sickness , cholinergic agonist neostigmine show increase incidence PONV , especially inject intrathecally . Anticholinergic agent muscarinic selectivity may effective prevent treat PONV . Intravenous ( IV ) administration scopolamine atropine , glycopyrrolate , reduce incidence PONV . Intuitively , glycopyrrolate cross blood-brain barrier , postoperative anti-emetic effect anticholinergic drug mediate central receptor . Few study specifically evaluate antiemetic effect IV atropine balance general opioid-based regional anesthesia , conflict result . Atropine may represent valid alternative scopolamine adverse effect ; however , apparent duration action `` brief '' ( minute 1 hour ) administer IV . After become aware several observation Ramaioli De Amici efficacy small-dose intrathecal ( IT ) atropine treatment PONV IT morphine administration , set investigate use agent prophylaxis PONV high-risk population , patient receive IT morphine postoperative analgesia elective Caesarean section .</detailed_description>
