	<detailed_description>Aging associate progressive development impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) , due increase peripheral tissue resistance action insulin . Insulin resistance , common state obese sedentary individual , eventually lead development glucose intolerance , type 2 diabetes age . Even absence diabetes , insulin resistance key feature various metabolic abnormality increase risk develop cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Previous study demonstrate improvement glucose tolerance glucose utilization follow moderate energy restriction couple moderate intensity AEX . WL , behavioral modification diet aerobic exercise ( AEX ) , perhaps effective way treat well prevent insulin resistance associate metabolic complication IGT type 2 diabetes . Although study demonstrate beneficial effect weight loss ( WL ) AEX glucose tolerance insulin action , much know cellular molecular mechanism nonpharmacologic treatment improve glucose utilization high-risk obese old individual . This study seek determine cellular mechanism aerobic exercise weight loss alter skeletal muscle insulin signal improve insulin action old glucose intolerant individual . A second purpose determine whether certain gene ( hereditary information ) affect way body utilizes glucose response exercise weight loss . In addition , adipose tissue increasingly recognize inert depot serve accept store excess energy form triglyceride , also secrete hormone adipokines substantial effect lipid glucose metabolism . Furthermore , depot difference metabolic function , well adipokine content . However , physiology underlie consequential observation remain unknown . Thus , third aim examine effect obesity regional adipokine secretion expression , relationship adipokines insulin resistance metabolic syndrome .</detailed_description>
