	<brief_summary>Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) involve place electrode brain . Through electrode , artificial electrical signal chronically deliver deep brain region order alter abnormal brain activity . The artificial electrical signal generate battery inserted skin chest . DBS use treat several disorder movement , include dystonia . In dystonia , electrode insert brain region call globus pallidus . Globus pallidus stimulation effective therapy dystonia . However patient equally responsive therapeutic outcome frustratingly variable . The reason variability unclear . Such variability response may need meet tailor stimulation individual patient . Another issue deep brain stimulation battery life . Eventually , battery become depleted need replace . Such battery replacement require operation , hospital stay risk introduce infection . The high electrical energy use treat dystonia mean battery typically replace every year two . The artificial electrical signal deep brain stimulation deliver three parameter ; frequency ( Hertz - Hz ) , voltage ( volt ) pulse width ( microsecond ) . It recently report low frequency stimulation , 60Hz rather 130Hz , use effectively treat dystonia . Such 60Hz stimulation may effective patient others . The low energy demand 60Hz stimulation would also greatly improve battery life ( potentially double battery life ) . The aim study assess 60Hz stimulation effective ameliorate dystonia patient respond poorly 130Hz pallidal stimulation . The current status evidence one clinical equipoise ( uncertainty ) therefore suit double blind randomised trial .</brief_summary>
