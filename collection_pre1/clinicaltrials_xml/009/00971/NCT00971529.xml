	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoke major risk factor series life threaten disease include cancer heart attack , cause million death year worldwide . Many harmful effect cigarette smoke reverse quitting ; however , due addictive nature nicotine , quit smoke extremely difficult . Despite effort , currently available method produce modest smoking cessation rate relapse . Previously , tea component show protect effect cigarette smoke-induced toxicity . Here investigator report unprecedented smoking cessation effect tea . Green tea make cigarette filter test smoke cessation effect double-blind clinical study . The tea filter could effectively achieve abstinence relapse use smoke process quite smoke easy use smoker without side effect psychological obstacle . This work provide new idea innovative method combat tobacco epidemic . Its implementation popularization may make great contribution towards reduce smoking-related disease , relieve public health burden pollution cause cigarette smoking .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation Effect Tea Filter Through Inhibition Nicotine Receptor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cigarette smoking link many life threaten disease include heart disease , cancer chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . There 1.25 billion smoker world . Five million people die every year smoking-related disease . This rate exceed many disease combine . It estimate global cost smoking-related diseases $ 200 billion year , pose one big public human health problem around world . Many method develop smoke cessation scientist doctor worldwide . However , due addictive nature nicotine , quit smoke extremely difficult . Despite effort , currently available smoke cessation method produce modest successful rate relapse . In addition , often convenient lead wide variety side effect . Therefore , need new idea develop new smoke cessation technique well efficacy few side effect urgent . Epidemiological evidence show tea adversely associated cancer , hyperglycemia disease . In addition , show tea component protect cell cigarette smoke-induced toxicity . Recently , develop new cigarette filter contain tea . While test filter detoxification effect , find several subject smoker decrease cigarette consumption subsequently abstain cigarette smoking use tea filter period time . Animal experiment reveal derivative tea component prevent nicotine addiction similar nicotine acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) inhibitor . It significantly inhibit nicotine-induced expression alpha4 , alpha7 Î²2 subunit nAChR tyrosine hydroxylase release dopamine . This find encourage u recruit volunteer test smoke cessation effect tea filter . One hundred healthy male cigarette smoker , age 18 30 year , screen 30 exclude base exclusion/inclusion criterion . 70 volunteer double-blinded , placebo-controlled randomize 2 group ( smoke tea filter regular filter ) . Smoking history , include nicotine dependence , assess screen visit . Exclusion criterion include treatment investigational drug within previous month ; major depression within prior year ; panic disorder , psychosis , bipolar disorder ; use nicotine replacement therapy drug within previous 3 month ; cardiovascular disease ; clinically significant medical disease ; drug alcohol abuse dependence within past year ; use tobacco product cigarette smoke within previous month . Subjects received brief smoke cessation counseling ( 10 minute ) baseline visit visit afterwards . Self-reported smoking status since last visit exhale carbon monoxide measurement assess weekly visit . Vital sign , weight , adverse event information collect visit . A physical examination perform prior randomization final visit . Urine blood collect screening , baseline , week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 biochemical analysis . The average number cigarette consume daily one volunteer smoker clinic trial calculate control . The average number cigarette consume daily one volunteer clinic trial calculate number use calculate average number cigarette consume daily one smoker week compare control . Continuous abstinence define self-report cigarette use specify time period confirm exhaled carbon monoxide measurement 10 ppm low . To consider abstinent smoking treatment period , subject also report use nicotine-containing product . During follow-up period , use nicotine replacement therapy disqualify subject consider abstinent . Subjects withdraw lose follow-up assume smoker remainder study . The exhaled carbon monoxide detect carbon monoxidemeter ( 1209-1 CO , DWYER , USA ) . Nicotine cotinine urine detect use HPLC ( HITACH , Japan ) report literature . 30 volunteer control group 22 volunteer male cigarette smoker consume average approximately cigarettes per day , randomly divide 2 group ( double-blind , placebo-controlled ) ; smoke tea filter regular filter . After use tea filter 1 month , average daily cigarette consumption decrease 43 % tea filter group . In contrast , change average daily cigarette consumption detect control group use regular filter . The trial discontinue control group tea filter group follow another month . After use tea filter 2 month . We recruit 59 volunteer longer smoke history strong desire quit smoke smoke cessation test use tea filter . The subject follow 5 month follow protocol describe earlier .</detailed_description>
