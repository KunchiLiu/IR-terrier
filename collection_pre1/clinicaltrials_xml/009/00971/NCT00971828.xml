	<detailed_description>This study coordinate Dr Hector Chinoy , Dr Robert G Cooper ( Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust / The University Manchester ) Dr Ian N Bruce ( Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust/ The University Manchester ) . An initial pilot study complete , establish proof concept study examine whether trend may observe difference case control . Thirty UK Caucasian adult IIM case , confimed internationally accepted criterion , recruit via Adult Onset Myositis clinic , Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust . Age , gender racematched control recruit 'best friend ' system . STUDY METHODS : In order establish whether CHD risk increase patient myositis , would like perform pilot study , compare cardiovascular risk factor 30 patient 's Salford Royal 's adult myositis clinic , group 30 healthy control . Participant would invite along Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility ( WTCRF ) , necessary test would perform 'one ' study visit . Participants would ask bring along friend gender roughly age , would comprise 'healthy control ' comparison group . The study would involve consultant clinician complete 'heart disease questionnaire ' participant . A single blood sample would take check blood sugar level cholesterol , myositis , disease activity would also assess . The non invasive diagnostic testing would include ultrasound blood vessel neck , check narrow artery , special blood pressure test , look early sign atherosclerosis ( build fat blood vessel ) . An electrocardiogram ( ECG ) would perform , myositis , ultrasound test heart ( echocardiogram ) , would also perform . A gadoliniumenhanced magnetic resonance scan ( GdDTPAMRI ) heart perform examine inflammation heart tissue ( pericardium myocardium ) . The echo MR perform patient , control . If study demonstrate patient myositis chance develop CHD , control group , would implications future clinical care , require close monitoring patient early sign CHD , appropriate intervention necessary . This study fund WTCRF Small Grants Award Scheme.MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF STUDY METHODS : Cases control follow record assessment cardiovascular risk factor : ) Standardised questionnaire ascertain basic detail , e.g . age , ethnicity , medical family history , drug use smoking . ii ) Height weight measurement . iii ) Blood test , include fast blood sugar , lipid profile &amp; Creactive protein . iv ) Lean body mass measurement use body composition analyser . v ) Electrocardiogram . v ) Subclinical atherosclerosis measurement use Bmode ultrasound CIMT . vi ) Endothelial dysfunction measurement use EndoPAT . Cases additionally follow assess disease status : ) Clinical assessment myositis disease activity ( MITAX/MYOACT ) disease damage ( MDI , MYODAM ) . ii ) Assessment muscle strength use manual muscle test . iii ) Further blood include serum creatine kinase , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , serology include antiphospholipid status . iv ) Assessment leave ventricular/septal dysfunction , pericardial abnormality use contrast echocardiography . vi ) Assessment diagnostic utility GdDTPAMRI ass myocardial disease activity presence cardiovascular disease . All procedure conduct technician nurse employ within WTCRF . The clinical muscle strength assessment perform medical practitioner ( appoint ) . At WTCRF , The University Manchester , facility already available Bmode ultrasound CIMT measurement , EndoPAT , lean body mass measurement contrast echocardiography . Cases control cardiovascular risk factor assess use standardised questionnaire blood test . Further test perform include blood pressure , electrocardiogram , lean body mass , Bmode ultrasound carotid artery narrow EndoPAT . IIM case additional blood test clinical assessment ass disease status . As part link study , subject ( control ) also GdDTPAMRI contrast echocardiography heart perform . The primary research end point detection significant patient/control group difference .</detailed_description>
