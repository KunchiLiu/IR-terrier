	<brief_title>Low Vision Study Comparing EV Training vs. CCTV AMD Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration single common cause visual impairment Canada , affect people age 55 year . It cause loss central , detailed vision , result difficulty fine vision task , read writing . At present fully effective prevention treatment condition , people benefit visual rehabilitation . Two common rehabilitation technique eccentric view training electronic magnification system call Closed circuit television ( CCTV ) . In eccentric view train person taught use remain side vision , instead central vision . The CCTV provide high level magnification compensate loss detail vision . The purpose randomized clinical trial compare effectiveness two intervention . In study people randomly assign either receive eccentric view training CCTV . This happen receive basic , optical low vision service train CNIB . We assess performance either CCTV EV train variety reading task questionnaire . The result give evidence beneficial use resource important future plan low vision service . Hypothesis : Eccentric Viewing Training improve read speed CCTV least 10 word per minute patient advance AMD .</detailed_description>
