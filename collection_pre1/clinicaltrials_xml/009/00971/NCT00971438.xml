	<brief_title>Structured Management Patients With Suspicion Appendicitis Using Clinical Score Selective Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suspect appendicitis common . Evidence base efficient guideline management patient lack . Small change management patient may important consequence health system . The diagnosis difficult 25 % operation non-inflamed appendix find . The management patient equivocal diagnosis controversial . Some advocate early surgical exploration avoid increase morbidity follow perforation , associate high frequency negative exploration acceptable trade . Others propose active observation , give improve diagnostic accuracy without increase number perforation . Early detection treatment important advance appendicitis , associate high morbidity mortality , whereas spontaneous resolution possibility phlegmonous appendicitis . The management base disease history , clinical presentation laboratory examination . We show inflammatory variable higher discriminate capacity previously think , especially advanced appendicitis . There also new inflammatory marker unknown diagnostic value . The clinical diagnosis subjective art , make objective use clinical scoring system . This suggest clinical diagnosis improve . Imaging technique , ultrasound ( US ) Computerised Tomography ( CT ) show high sensitivity specificity prospective study specialise centre result everyday use less encouraging . Some result suggests unselective use image lead increase number appendectomy increase detection appendicitis case would otherwise resolve untreated . This result line report show 3 5 time case appendicitis among patient randomise early diagnostic laparoscopy compare traditional management . The impact US diagnosis appendicitis compare traditional management evaluate one randomise trial find benefit US . For CT three randomise small trial conflict result . These technique expensive , limited availability suffer limitation like potentially harmful ionize radiation ( CT ) examiner dependent efficacy ( US ) . The exact role image management patient suspicion appendicitis therefore still remain defined . The clinical diagnosis involve subjective synthesis large amount complex information , rely surgeon 's knowledge previous experience similar case . This process could improve use clinical scoring system , objectively determine prognosis current patient similar patient score construct . This used basis structure algorithm management patient depend probability appendicitis . Previous score system , `` Alvarado '' score well know , gain wide acceptance partly due lack performance validation study . Possible reason weaknesses construction . A scoring system ideally construct diagnostic variable strong independent discriminate capacity group patient similar intend applied , ie patient suspicion appendicitis . Few score system include inflammatory marker , show high discriminate power . All previous score loose discriminate capacity dichotomisation variable . Many score system also fail use appropriate mathematical model construction . Most scoring system define one cut point high sensitivity appendicitis insufficient specificity decide operation . A realistic approach define three diagnostic test zone , one high sensitivity appendicitis identify patient safely discharge outpatient follow within 24 hour , another high specificity appendicitis identify patient operate without examination , indeterminate group patient need additional diagnostic workup . We construct clinical scoring system include mainly objective inflammatory variable . In validation study score correctly classify 63 % patient suspicion appendicitis group high low suspicion appendicitis accuracy 97 % . This leave 37 % indeterminate result select use CT could play role . Aim current study The aim study analyze effect implementation clinical score basis structure management patient suspect appendicitis , especially selection patient may benefit CT examination . The study interventional study Base-line period current management patient suspicion appendicitis register , Intervention-period management base result clinical score system . In Intervention phase study patient indeterminate score result randomise diagnostic imaging repeat examination period observation . Patients All patient age 10 year less 5 day duration symptom suspicion appendicitis emergency department include study . In Baseline phase actual management management patient register ( symptom , laboratory value , admission hospital , use diagnostic imaging , surgical intervention complication ) . The management patient change . During Intervention phase management base result clinical score associate propose algorihtm . For group high low probability appendicitis algorithm recommend surgical exploration observation , respectively . Patients low score unaltered general condition suspicion serious disease recommend observe home follow outpatient within 24 hour . The algorithm advice surgeon liberty manage patient accord choice accord local tradition , ask note reason breach propose algorithm . The outcomes implementation algorithm analyse comparison result Baseline registration . The outcome evaluate : 1 . The incidence patient admit observation discharge diagnosis non-specific abdominal pain , compare Baseline phase . We expect intervention lead few admission . 2 . The incidence operation phlegmonous advance appendicitis negative exploration , compare Baseline phase . We expect decrease incidence phlegmonous appendicitis negative exploration without increase incidence perforation . 3 . The utilisation CT , ultrasound diagnostic laparoscopy group high low scoring , compare Baseline phase . We expect use image decrease group intervention . Part B - Randomised trial Patients indeterminate score result randomise repeat examination in-hospital observation diagnostic imaging . The patient randomise observation reassess score 6 hour observation earlier patient condition deteriorate . At second assessment surgeon free decide management . The following outcome analyse : 1 . The number patient operate non-perforated appendicitis . This may higher image group patient mild appendicitis resolve without treatment may detect . 2 . The number negative appendectomy . This may lower image group . 3 . The number perforation . We expect difference group . 4 . The delay admittance surgery . This may shorter image group . 5 . The number diagnosis need treatment . This may higher image group . 6 . Costs hospital stay . The cost image balance earlier discharge . Power calculation According validation score 37 % admitted patient classified indeterminate score . Of 41 % appendicitis , 15 % negative appendectomy 44 % operate . Diagnostic imaging may decrease number negative appendectomy . A sample size 686 randomise patient arm may detect decrease 15 % 10 % ( alfa error 0.05 , beta error 0.80 ) . Ethical issue The propose algorithm close standard management patient suspect appendicitis . As effect intervention management formalise evidence base current management . The algorithm advice surgeon free diverge advice accord judgment local tradition . This mean risk adverse effect patient small compensate positive effect . The study protocol approve regional ethical committee ( M15-09 ) .</detailed_description>
