	<brief_summary>High blood pressure major risk factor Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . The prevalence hypertension Brazil establish population-based study conduct different city States , vary 22.3 44 % adult . The benefit drug treatment hypertension prevent major cardiovascular event consistently demonstrate large series clinical trial control placebo . Diuretics least efficacious blood pressure-lowering drug , well tolerate , long duration action advantage low cost use population intervention . Chlorthalidone efficacious agent . Its main limitation induce hypokalemia proportion patient , adverse effect antagonize potassium-sparing diuretic , amiloride . A study compare diuretic ARB agent therefore recommendable Brazil , order support decision Health Secretary regard blood pressure agent supply Brazilian population . Such study demand funded Health Technology Ministries Brazil .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) already lead cause death Brazil . The superiority particular agent among group blood pressure-lowering drug investigate various clinical trial . ALLHAT , large well design trial show chlorthalidone similar efficacy prevent fatal non-fatal coronary event ACE inhibitor ( lisinopril ) calcium channel blocker agent ( amlodipine ) . Chlorthalidone superior agent prevention cardiovascular outcome , particularly heart failure . Amlodipine superior valsartan , angiotensin-receptor blocker ( ARB ) agent , prevention CHD stroke . There head-to-head comparison diuretic ARB agent prevention hard cardiovascular outcome , even comparison blood pressure-lowering effect scarcely described literature . Despite , ARB agent lead brand term profit various country world , include Brazil . This leadership base strong commercial strategy , include distortion evidence clinical trial favor drug . The idea blood pressure-independent effect accept , despite evidence well design trial . The option ARB agent instead diuretic first line option public health system Brazil would result large expenditure resource , pressure include list essential drug provide government . This nation-based trial , 24 clinical center distribute 9 States . A Coordinating Committee responsible elaboration proposal main decision trial . The organizational chart study include executive Committee , safety committee , outcome committee , lab EKG center , research unit . Research question 1 . Is losartan efficacious safe association chlorthalidone amiloride first option control blood pressure patient stage I hypertension ? 2 . Is losartan efficacious association chlorthalidone amiloride first option prevent development target-organ damage patient stage I hypertension ? 3 . Is losartan efficacious association chlorthalidone amiloride first option prevent occurrence major cardiovascular event patient stage I hypertension ? Methods Design : randomize , double-blind , clinical trial , control active treatment . Eligible participant : patient older 40 year age Stage I hypertension . Exclusion criterion : low life expectancy , indication use diuretic , cardiovascular disease , intolerance study drug , pregnancy . Random allocation : computer generate list , stratify center . Interventions : Chlorthalidone plus amiloride 25 e 5 mg daily , versus losartan 100 mg daily . Amlodipine 10 mg daily propranolol 160 mg/dia , open fashion , add blood pressure control . Outcomes : Primary : 1 . Blood pressure variation proportion use add-on drug . 2 . Adverse event . 3 . Development worsen microalbuminuria leave ventricular hypertrophy EKG . Secondary : fatal major cardiovascular event : myocardial infarction , stroke , coronary intervention , heart failure , duplication creatinine . Follow-up duration study : consultation evaluation enrollment thereafter consultation 3th. , 6th. , 9th , 12th . 18th . month .</detailed_description>
