	<brief_summary>Cutaneous leiomyoma benign tumor smooth muscle origin . They painful , current treatment tumor associate pain produce satisfactory result . One potential treatment localize severe muscle pain involve injection botulinum toxin A . This study investigate effectiveness , side effect , dosage botulinum toxin A ( BOTOX ) treatment patient pain associate cutaneous leiomyoma . This study include 18 subject , 18 year age old , pain associate cutaneous leiomyoma . For 24-week study , patient randomly assign one two treatment group . Neither study team patient know group patient assign . Before study begin , participant must provide full medical history research evaluation purpose , fill pain quality-of-life questionnaire , undergo ice test researcher apply ice site cutaneous leiomyoma ask participant evaluate level pain ice application . Both group require keep pain diary throughout study record level pain daily basis , ask avoid restrict use specific medication remedy treat pain . At first visit ( Week 0 ) , one group receive prescribe dose botulinum toxin A , administer injection leiomyoma , ( control ) group receive placebo injection saline solution . Patients return 4 week later , time undergo medical examination , ice test , complete questionnaire assess response level pain . Patients return Week 12 , time group assignment reveal ( un-blinded ) investigator patient . Patients receive placebo injection offer opportunity receive injection botulinum toxin A leiomyoma . All patient undergo medical examination , ice test , complete questionnaire , continue complete daily pain diary home . The final visit , Week 24 , follow procedure Week 4 visit . At end study , patient may eligible one painful cutaneous leiomyoma surgically remove researcher believe skin lesion remove reasonable cosmetic result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Pilot Study Treatment Cutaneous Leiomyomas With Botulinum Toxin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Cutaneous leiomyoma smooth muscle tumor may arise sporadically association inherit cancer-related genodermatosis . - Leiomyomas may severely painful , current management generally unsatisfactory . - Studies demonstrate increase nerve density within around leiomyomas well increased acetylcholinesterase stain associated nerve . - Botulinum toxin-A use treatment pain syndrome . - Based known mechanism action botulinum toxin-A , treatment botulinum toxin-A ( BOTOX ; Allergan , Inc. ) , may ameliorate severe paroxysmal pain symptomatic cutaneous leiomyoma . Objectives : - Primary : To assess change bad lesional pain past week base Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) Week 0 Week 4 treat patient versus control . - Primary : To assess improvement pain base Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) application ice Week 4 compare baseline treat patient versus control . - Secondary : To assess change magnitude frequency painful episode base weekly patient diary treat patient versus control . - Secondary : To assess persistence pain control Weeks 12 base BPI VAS . - Secondary : To assess frequency rescue pain medication use treat patient versus control 24 week study period . - Secondary : To determine impact leiomyoma treatment quality life . - Secondary : To assess change patient condition base Patient Global Impression Change . - Secondary : To evaluate immunohistochemical stain nerve fiber muscle cutaneous leiomyoma control treat lesion follow conclusion study . Eligibility : - Subjects great equal to18 year least 1 symptomatic cutaneous leiomyoma . - Pain symptom must occur least week characterize great equal 5 10 . Design : - A 12-week double-blind placebo control pilot study 18 subject symptomatic leiomyoma include initial assessment BPI , photography , skin biopsy , follow treatment subject initially receive placebo . - Cutaneous leiomyoma undergo intralesional injection botulinum toxin-A . - Subjects return Weeks 4 12 repeat assessment use pain quality life questionnaires photography . Skin biopsy perform week 12 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Subjects must age great equal to18 year . 2 . Subjects must prior biopsyproven diagnosis cutaneous leiomyoma . 3 . Subjects must least 1 symptomatic leiomyoma region less equal 60 cm^2 leiomyoma pain characterize great 4 base 10point scale , indicate pain least moderate severity . 4 . Pain episode must occur least week . 5 . Subjects must ability participate fully comply procedure protocol opinion investigator . 6 . Written inform consent obtain include consent tissue sample store , however subject allow refuse sample storage . 7 . Negative urine serum pregnancy test female childbearing potential . 8 . Subjects clinically stable expect complete 24week study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Subjects allergies BTXA . 2 . Females positive pregnancy test , breastfeeding , plan pregnancy study , think may pregnant start study female childbearing potential unable unwilling use reliable form contraception study . 3 . Subjects neuromuscular junction disorder ( ie . myasthenia gravis LambertEaton syndrome ) peripheral motor neuropathic disease ( ie . amyotrophic lateral sclerosis motor neuropathy ) . 4 . Subjects infection intend sit injection . 5 . Subjects prior Botulinum toxin product within past 6 month . 6 . Subjects pain result disease ( ) , specifically : pain require intermittent ongoing treatment narcotic severe , debilitate , acute pain originate source leiomyomas 7 . Subjects take pain medication , neuroactive agent , therapy direct toward treatment cutaneous leiomyoma concurrently within 5 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) BTXA treatment , specify rescue pain medication ) . Patients currently therapy direct toward OTHER mild moderate chronic pain evaluate casebycase basis inclusion . Patients wellcontrolled mild moderate chronic pain associate osteoarthritis , require narcotic therapy , NOT exclude . Aspirin pain relief indication also acceptable . 8 . Subjects latestage cancer unstable disease ( hemodynamic instability , i.e. , systolic diastolic blood pressure fall 20 mm Hg great stable patient baseline measurement ) . 9 . A condition situation , investigator 's opinion , may put subject significant risk interfere significantly subject 's participation study .</criteria>
