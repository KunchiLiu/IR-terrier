	<brief_summary>This randomize controlled trial effect chew gum body weight . The investigator randomly assign 200 overweight mildly obese adult one two group . Participants must otherwise healthy age 19-50 . The control group receive print information optimal diet increase physical activity . The intervention group instruct chew gum follow meal place snack minimum 90 minute per day . The intervention group also receive information optimal diet increase physical activity control group . In 8-week intervention , primary outcome change body weight , secondary outcome change body mass income ( BMI ) , waist circumference , blood pressure . The protocol include 3 clinic visit assess outcome : baseline , 4 week randomization , 8 week randomization . Adherence gum chew protocol assess clinic visit 2 telephone call 2 week 6 week post-randomization . The investigator ' hypothesis gum-chewers lose weight receive information .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In randomize controlled trial effect chew gum body weight , randomly assign 200 overweight mildly obese , otherwise healthy adult ( men woman , age 19 50 ) , one two group : 1 ) control group , receive print information optimal diet increase physical activity , 2 ) intervention group , participant instruct chew gum follow meal place snack minimum 90 minute per day , addition receive information optimal diet increase physical activity control group . In 8-week intervention , primary outcome change body weight , secondary outcome change body mass income ( BMI ) , waist circumference , blood pressure . Outcome measure assess group via clinic visit baseline , 4 week post-randomization , 8 week post-randomization . Adherence gum chew protocol assess clinic visit , well telephone contact 2 week 6 week post-randomization . The effect chew gum intervention assess analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) , wherein treatment assignment independent variable ; outcome measure describe serve dependent variable ; pre-randomization factor age , sex , baseline BMI use covariates . Our hypothesis randomize intervention group lowe weight randomize control group .</detailed_description>
