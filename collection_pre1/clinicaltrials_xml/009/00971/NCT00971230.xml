	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety acceptability intermittent daily PrEP regimen use Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate plus Emtricitabine ( FTC/TDF ) men woman risk HIV , directly compare adherence intracellular drug level daily intermittent PrEP recipient . It also evaluate relationship drug adherence , sexual behavior intracellular drug level intermittent PrEP regimen . In addition evaluate relationship adherence intermittent PrEP regimen time sexual activity relation PrEP dosing . The study use objective medication event monitor medication event monitor ( MEMS ) adherence measurement evaluate feasibility new adherence measurement hair sample plasma drug level . The study also evaluate feasibility use SMS ( text message ) collect sexual activity data African setting . It allow study team community prepare potential subsequent large trial intermittent PrEP . This study size evaluate efficacy . If intermittent PrEP regimen show safe , feasible term adherence , achieve intracellular drug level similar daily PrEP , data could use design large phase 2 study one intermittent PrEP regimens . The goal trial would provide bridge data daily PrEP regimens find effective prepare efficacy non-inferiority trial intermittent versus daily PrEP . Investigation immune response associate FTC/TDF also evaluate pilot study . The proportion volunteer FTC/TDF HIV-specific immune response , due exposure lead establish HIV infection , assess 2-3 time point compare response volunteer assign placebo . Immune response may correlate risk behavior host factor , human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) type . As noted , HIV infection expect occur study , correlation HIV-specific immune response protection infection attenuation disease progression possible large study conduct .</brief_summary>
