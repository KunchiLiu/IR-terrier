	<brief_summary>Chronic stress propose involve development western life-style disease cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) . At time chronic stress also believe cause psychiatric disease melancholic depression ( MD ) anxiety disorder . Accordingly , human bear low birth weight ( LBW ) ( ei . le 5,0 LB ) display increase risk T2DM MD . Studies suggest stress adrenal stress hormone ( glucocorticoid ) ( GCC ) might involve development condition . Recent study animal bear LBW suggest , SSRI-compounds , usually employ treatment MD-related disease , reduces stress-responses level stress hormone adrenal steroid time positive influence glucose metabolism . In present study , investigator aim measure level GCC stress ass glucose metabolism healthy young men ( 20-35 year ) bear LBW ( 40 subject ) . The volume structure certain brain area ( ie . hippocampus ) involve regulation adrenal GCC know malfunction chronically stress individual assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Further metabolic examination accompany MRI spectroscopy liver muscle fat content well total fat content ( Dexa-scanning ) content fat abdomen ( MRI ) . Psychiatric well-ness symptom characterize well-established questionnaire MDI SCL-92 response regard blood pressure , heart rate change basal plasma concentration GCC Epinephrine assess perform Stroop Stress Test . Finally , 24 hour blood pressure profile test include . After extensive examination program , subject randomize 3-4 month treatment either Escitalopram ( SSRI-compound ) Placebo . Subsequently , end treatment , whole examination program repeat detect potential beneficial change . A group young normal birth weight men ( 20 subject ) serve healthy baseline group comparison expose medical treatment . This trial add understanding mechanism underlie development type 2 diabetes depression LBW . Additionally , present trial might capable propose novel treatment strategy prevent development diseases LBW man .</brief_summary>
