	<brief_title>A Study In Patients Who Will Undergo Surgical Removal Of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer To Evaluate Molecular Changes That Occur In Tumor Tissue After Short Term Exposure To PF-00299804</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The A7471031 study terminate May 2 , 2012 . The decision unplanned study termination trigger feasibility conduct trial 22 protocol-specified 75 patient enrol since study initiate February 2010 . Based low accrual rate determine study highly unlikely complete accrual provide meaningful data . The discontinuation study due safety issue .</detailed_description>
