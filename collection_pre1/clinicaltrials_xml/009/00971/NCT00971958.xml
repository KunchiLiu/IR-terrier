	<brief_summary>Background : Novel HIV prevention approach urgently need Botswana elsewhere sub-Saharan Africa . Although adult male circumcision ( MC ) show reduce heterosexual acquisition HIV men 60 % , MC infancy optimal relative ease , low cost low rate complication . We conduct focus group semi-structured interview suggest neonatal MC ( &lt; 28 day life ) would acceptable public HIV prevention strategy Botswana . The government Botswana commit scale MC service immediate future plan include neonate . Understanding decision-making around infant MC essential maximize effectiveness HIV prevention strategy . Specific Aims : The investigator propose : 1 ) determine acceptability actual uptake neonatal MC southeastern Botswana identify barrier uptake ; 2 ) ascertain feasibility safety neonatal MC Botswana ; 3 ) Estimate , , advantage would exist scale Mogen Clamp , Plastibell AccuCirc regard human resource , equipment need , adverse event acceptability health-care provider family Botswana . Study Design Schema : The investigator conduct structure interview early postpartum mother father determine correlate neonatal MC acceptability uptake , define neonatal MC follow informed consent . Male infant circumcise trained doctor hospital / clinic set one three FDA-approved device currently use US hospital : Mogen clamp , Plastibell AccuCirc . Circumcision Mogen Clamp Plastibell do 29 day life . Circumcision AccuCirc do 11 day life ( FDA approval limit device ) . The investigator also administer questionnaire parent regular pediatric follow-up visit ( ) ass impression / satisfaction infant 's procedure outcome time . Provider impression three method also evaluate . Sample size 150 infant per arm total 450 infant male circumcise ( estimate 800 parental questionnaire ) . Public Health Significance : The World Health Organization ( WHO ) UNAIDS state country severe , generalize HIV epidemic low rate MC offer surgery important , evidence-based HIV prevention intervention , include among neonate . These two agency also recommend additional research feasible , safe , sustainable way scale MC intervention perform . This study keep recommendation . Please note Mogen clamp Plastibell study arm begin randomized trial initiation AccuCirc single-arm portion . Although setting three device study similar , AccuCirc trial enrollment begin two site ( Gaborone Molepolole ) completion Mogen clamp Plastibell arm , conduct three site ( Gaborone , Molepolole Mochudi ) . Although Lobatse site first acceptability study mother , procedure perform . Regarding report sample size : total , final sample size include parent newborn boy ( enrol consenting parent complete questionnaire part study ) , boys whose parent consent circumcision . We anticipate parent complete questionnaire would consent circumcise baby ; therefore , plan study necessary estimate number parent would participate survey ( 700 ) , achieve enrollment 300 neonate ( therefore initial estimate 1000 ) . The original study fact enrol 302 infant , 600 mother 19 father ( total study population 921 ) . The addition AccuCirc arm lead revised estimate total number neonate parent ( total=1250 ) . The final enrollment 1,235 participant , include participate neonate parent .</brief_summary>
