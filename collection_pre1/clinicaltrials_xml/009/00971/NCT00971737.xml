	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make gene-modified tumor cell may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Biological therapy , cyclophosphamide trastuzumab , may increase number immune cell make immune response stronger . It yet know whether give cyclophosphamide together vaccine therapy effective without trastuzumab treat patient metastatic breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study side effect give cyclophosphamide together vaccine therapy see well work compare give cyclophosphamide vaccine therapy together trastuzumab treat patient metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide Vaccine Therapy With Without Trastuzumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate safety cyclophosphamide-modulated vaccination v without trastuzumab patient breast cancer overexpress HER-2/neu . - To compare clinical benefit cyclophosphamide-modulated vaccination v without trastuzumab patient . - To measure HER-2/neu-specific CD4+ CD8+ T-cell immunity delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) ELISPOT . - To measure pharmacodynamics CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell flow cytometry . Secondary - To assess impact trastuzumab immune prim vivo immunohistochemistry vaccine-site biopsy day +3 day +7 course 1 3 two study arm , compare cellular infiltrates see previous preclinical clinical model . - To measure hTERT-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity ELISPOT . - To characterize peripheral-memory T-cell pool . Tertiary - To determine baseline change vaccine site-draining lymph node immunohistology gene expression profile . - To develop tandem tetramer/CD107a cytotoxicity assay HER-2/neu-specific CD8+ T cell . - To measure novel T-cell response induce trastuzumab cyclophosphamide-modulated vaccination . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day -1 allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting breast cancer vaccine intradermally day 0 . Courses repeat every 4-6 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive fourth vaccination 6-8 month . - Arm II : Patients receive cyclophosphamide vaccine arm I trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute day -1 . Courses repeat every 4-6 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive fourth vaccination 6-8 month . Skin punch lymph node biopsy collect baseline day +3 +7 course 1 3 biomarker analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
