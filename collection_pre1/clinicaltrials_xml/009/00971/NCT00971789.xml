	<brief_summary>Background : People phosphatase tensin homolog delete chromosome 10 ( PTEN ) hamartomatous tumor syndrome ( PHTS ) mutation one gene call PTEN lead benign tumor call hamartoma throughout body . This put increase risk breast , thyroid endometrial cancer . People PTEN mutation increase activity protein protein kinase B ( AKT ) mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) , may responsible tumor growth increase risk cancer . Experiments show drug call sirolimus , use prevent immune system reject transplanted organ , inhibit cancer cell growth block mTOR protein . Objectives : To test ability sirolimus decrease activity protein regulate mTOR benign cancerous tumor tissue . Eligibility : People 18 year age old Cowden syndrome PHTS . Design : Sirolimus treatment . Patients take sirolimus day 28-day treatment cycle . Patients cancer take drug total two cycle ( 56 day ) unless develop unacceptable side effect . Those cancer may continue sirolimus beyond cycle 2 disease worsens develop unacceptable side effect . Evaluations . Patients come clinic history physical examination day 1 every treatment cycle , every month first two month therapy , 6 12 month . In addition , follow procedure : - Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan neuropsychological test start treatment . - Clinical photography ( photographic documentation skin lesion ) start treatment . Patients cancer repeat photography 2 8 week , lesion shrink go away therapy , every month first 2 month sirolimus , 6 month 1 year . Patients cancer continue treatment beyond 8 week repeat photography every 8 week study . - Digital dermoscopy ( skin lesion examination use high resolution camera ) . This do interval clinical photography . - Multiple biopsy skin low intestine , possibly tumor patient cancer , start treatment , 2 week treatment 8 week treatment . - Blood urine test every week treatment first two cycle , every 4 week patient continue treatment beyond two cycle . - Imaging study , computerize tomography ( CT ) , ultrasound magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) patient cancer start treatment every two cycle monitor tumor size location .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - PTEN ( phosphatase tensin homolog delete chromosome 10 ) tumor suppressor gene whose function frequently lose genetic epigenetic mechanism cancer . Loss PTEN increase activation phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) /Akt/mTOR pathway , increase cellular proliferation survival . - Germline mutation PTEN associate number hamartomatous syndrome , Cowden Syndrome ( CS ) prototype . The set syndrome define germline PTEN mutation label PTEN Hamartomatous Tumor Syndromes PHTS . - Patients PHTS suffer increase morbidity mortality . Benign tumor hamartomas occur virtually every organ , commonly skin gastrointestinal tract , prompts frequent monitoring resection cause psychological physical stressor patient condition . - Cowden syndrome ( CS ) patient develop thyroid , breast , endometrial cancer earlier age general population , overall increase incidence cancer compare general population . These patient increase morbidity heighten surveillance diagnostic procedure . - No medical therapy exist PHTS patient . - Because tumor PHTS patient show increased activation PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway , inhibitor pathway might activity patient PHTS . - Sirolimus ( rapamycin ) specific inhibitor mTOR Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved preferentially effective cell mutant PTEN . - We hypothesize sirolimus activity patient PHTS , measure biochemical technique assess mTOR inhibition clinical test assess growth metabolism benign malignant tumor . Objectives : - The primary endpoint inhibition mTOR pathway tissue obtain therapy , assess use immunohistochemistry benign well malignant tumor . - Secondary endpoint include inhibition mTOR pathway peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) assess immunoblotting , change duration change benign malignant tumor size assess compute tomography ( CT ) , serial digital photography , digital dermoscopy , change tumor metabolism assess positron emission tomography ( PET ) , change lymphocyte count , well change neuropsychological testing . Eligibility : -Adult subject document germline PTEN mutation meet diagnostic criterion Cowden Syndrome international criterion . Design : - Subjects undergo biopsy , imaging , photography , dermoscopy , neuropsychological test prior course therapy sirolimus assess efficacy treatment . - This pilot protocol test sirolimus FDA-approved dose ( 6 mg mouth ( PO ) load dose/ 2mg PO daily ) group twenty patient . - Treatment last 56 day ( plus 2 - 3 day allow flexibility schedule follow-up procedure ) PHTS subject benign hamartomatous tumor . - For PHTS subject establish malignancy , measurement disease perform every cycle treatment continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
