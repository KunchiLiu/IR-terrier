	<brief_summary>This retrospective study urine sample store Beaumont BioBank future research . The urine sample draw urine back patient previously diagnose severe interstitial cystitis ( IC ) , mild IC IC . Interstitial Cystitis ( IC ) also know Painful Bladder Syndrome ( PBS ) chronic inflammatory disease . It unknown etiology , symptoms present vary degree , well uncertain natural history . Diagnosis IC base symptom exclude common dangerous pathology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Urinary Biomarkers Characteristic Interstitial Cystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extensive research do understand multifactorial etiology well help diagnose IC . Infectious , autoimmune anatomic cause look usable result . Inflammatory cell marker productive . Recently show rat model , chemically induced inflammation , yield temporal increase measurable cytokine chemokines urine . Moreover , do Multiplex analysis , use multiple antigen bead assay ( Luminex ) . Cytokines chemokines , part organism proteome , allow look function cell organ time collection United States : Institutional Review Board . Urine obtain non-invasively yield significant information urinary tract organ . The ability find biomarker pattern biomarker urine , diagnostic disease , offer significant advantage serum tissue diagnosis . We hope identify pattern inflammatory marker use proteomic analysis use previously mention multiple antigen cassette ( Luminex ) well identify possible new biomarkers use Protein Chip SELDI -- TOF ( surface enhance laser desorption ionisation-time flight ) mass spectrometer . The detection pattern new biomarkers promise help diagnosis , treatment , ultimately reveal etiology course IC .</detailed_description>
