	<brief_summary>Clofarabine approve FDA treatment pediatric patient ( 1 21 year age ) relapse refractory ALL . Alemtuzumab approve FDA treatment B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B-CLL ) patient age 18 . These drug use treat patient leukemia research study like one . Both drug individually administer adult patient ALL acceptable toxicity profile . This study evaluate combination clofarabine alemtuzumab administer adult patient relapse refractory ALL . Primary objective study determine maximum tolerate dose clofarabine administer alemtuzumab , evaluate safety combination , assess activity combination evaluate response rate , effect ALL progenitor cell population , patient able bridge transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alemtuzumab Clofarabine Relapsed Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The strategy treat relapse refractory adult ALL patient reinduction chemotherapy follow allogeneic stem cell transplantation , provide toxicity salvage regimen acceptable . However , leukemia characterize highly refractory standard chemotherapy therefore novel therapeutic approach desperately need . Clofarabine second generation nucleoside analog FDA approve treatment relapse refractory pediatric ALL . Clofarabine administer adult patient hematologic malignancy acceptable toxicity profile 8 % relapse ALL patient attain complete response ( CR ) . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) clofarabine IV adult patient determine 40 mg/m2/day 5 consecutive day , low tolerable daily dose pediatric patient , 52 mg/m2/day . More recently , Karp colleague report experience clofarabine combination cyclophosphamide 18 patient refractory acute leukemia . Encouraging response see refractory ALL patient 67 % ( 4/6 ) patient experience CR . Toxicity allow dose escalation clofarabine MTD define 10 mg/m2 administer 6 non-consecutive day combine cyclophosphamide 200-400mg/m2 total 7 day per cycle . As , conservatively evaluate clofarabine dose 20mg/m2 five day dose de-escalation step dose limit toxicity . The addition monoclonal antibody therapy attractive approach treatment relapse refractory ALL since target B T progenitor ALL subtypes different mechanism action side effect chemotherapy . Alemtuzumab humanize monoclonal antibody CD52 express majority neoplastic lymphocyte , include 70 % ALL 100 % Philadelphia positive ALL . The CALGB evaluate alemtuzumab consolidation front-line therapy patient ALL demonstrated feasibility find alemtuzumab administration 30mg subcutaneously administer 12 dos safe well tolerated frontline consolidation set ALL . In present protocol target refractory relapse ALL patient , maximal alemtuzumab dose 30 mg Stock 's study , administer intravenously order improve induction chemotherapy pharmacokinetics . Premedication dexamethasone , benadryl , acetaminophen give patient prior alemtuzumab infusion prevent infusional reaction associate intravenous dosing . The combination purine analog alemtuzumab administer simultaneously safely promising additive activity relapse refractory lymphocytic leukemia . A recent case series report patient relapsed and/or refractory ALL fail several induction chemotherapy achieve complete response fludarabine alemtuzumab combination regimen . All patient able proceed allogeneic SCT refractory ALL patient relapse 8 month relapse patient remain remission 6 24 month . Other approach utilize combination chemotherapy fail demonstrate consistent activity would qualify standard care . Therefore standard care patient relapse refractory ALL enrollment clinical trial . All patient receive alemtuzumab dose escalation fashion ( 3 , 10 , 30mg ) . Successive escalating dos administer previous dose tolerate . Previously , Stock et al establish safety 12 dose 30mg alemtuzumab ALL . The treatment regimen design alemtuzumab administer prior administration clofarabine allow dose escalation monoclonal antibody decrease confound acute toxicity infusion reaction cytokine release . Clofarabine dose model previous trial adult pediatric ALL . The start dose clofarabine lower standard phase II dose adult hematologic malignancy conservatively evaluate tolerability toxicity clofarabine combination alemtuzumab . Alemtuzumab dose limited total 12 . However , patient continue additional cycle clofarabine show progressive disease unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
