	<brief_title>The Natural History Infantile Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infantile globoid cell leukodystrophy ( GLD , Krabbe disease ) rare , inherit degenerative disorder central peripheral nervous system . It characterize presence globoid cell ( multinucleated cell ) , breakdown nerve 's protective myelin coating , destruction brain cell . Globoid cell leukodystrophy one group genetic disorder call leukodystrophies . These disorder impair growth development myelin sheath , cause severe degeneration mental motor skill . Myelin , lend color `` white matter '' brain , complex substance make number different glucoproteins glucolipids , important galactocerebroside . Each leukodystrophies affect one substance . Globoid cell leukodystrophy cause deficiency galactocerebroside ß-galactosidase ( GALC ) , essential enzyme myelin metabolism . The disease often affect infant , onset age 6 month , occur adolescence adulthood . Symptoms include irritability , unexplained fever , limb stiffness ( hypertonia ) , seizures , feed difficulty , vomit , slow mental motor development . Other symptom include muscle weakness , spasticity , deafness , blindness . There cure globoid cell leukodystrophy . Generally , treatment disorder symptomatic supportive . Infantile globoid cell leukodystrophy generally fatal age 2 year . Patients juvenile- adult-onset disease generally milder course disease live significantly longer . Globoid cell leukodystrophy autosomal recessive disorder wide geographic distribution . The incidence United States estimate 1 100.000 birth . However , incidence appear high Scandinavian country . 32 Swedish case report period 1953 1967 calculate incidence 1.9 per 100.000 birth . To able compare benefit experience infant globoid cell leukodystrophy , receive possible future treatment , untreated , well understanding natural course infantile GLD necessary . The current literature contain case study individual small group GLD patient . A longitudinal study large population patient infantile GLD yet perform . This protocol 1.5 year longitudinal observational study capture natural history data patient infantile GLD . This data provide information range diversity clinical disease parameter future use evaluate treatment effect .</detailed_description>
