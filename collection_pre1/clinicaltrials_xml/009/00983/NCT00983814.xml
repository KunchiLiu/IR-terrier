ADHD second common neuropsychiatric disorder affect 4.4 % US adult population , 8-9 million individual ( Kessler et al. , 2006 ) . Droxidopa ( L-dihydroxyphenylserine ( L-DOPS ) ) synthetic catecholamine convert norepinephrine ( NE ) via decarboxylation , result increased level NE centrally CNS peripherally . Co-treatment carboxylase inhibitor , carbidopa , give droxidopa , increase CNS level NE great cross blood-brain barrier . Droxidopa receive orphan drug approval FDA treatment symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension individual primary autonomic failure . The half-life droxidopa approximately 2-3 hour , result administration thee time daily . As adult ADHD characterize disorder decrease NE activity pre-frontal cortex , hypothesize treat patient droxidopa ( co-administration carbidopa ) positive effect adult ADHD .</brief_summary>
