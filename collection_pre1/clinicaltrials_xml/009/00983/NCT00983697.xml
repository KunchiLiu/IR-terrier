	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Diagnostic procedure , fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET/CT scan , may help doctor find head neck cancer find far disease spread . It may also help doctor plan best treatment . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET/CT imaging see well work assess tumor planning neck surgery patient newly diagnose head neck cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine negative predictive value PET/CT image base upon pathologic sample neck lymph node patient head neck cancer planning undergo N0 neck surgery . - Determine potential PET/CT image change treatment . Secondary - Estimate sensitivity diagnostic yield PET/CT image detect occult metastasis clinical N0 neck ( neck lymph node region ) local site . - Determine effect factor ( e.g. , tumor size , location , secondary primary tumor , intensity FDG uptake ) lead identification subset patient could potentially forego neck dissection provide preliminary data subsequent study . - Compare cost-effectiveness use PET/CT image stag head neck cancer v current good clinical practice . - Evaluate incidence occult distant body metastasis discover whole-body PET/CT imaging . - Correlate PET/CT imaging finding CT/MRI finding biomarker result . - Evaluate quality life patient , particularly patient whose management could alter image result . - Evaluate PET/CT image biomarker data complementary contribution metastatic disease prediction . - Compare baseline PET/CT image biomarker data 2-year follow adjunct assessment prediction recurrence , disease-free survival , overall survival . - Determine proportion neck dissection extend ( i.e. , additional level clinician intend dissect beyond initial surgery plan ) base local-reader PET/CT imaging finding share surgeon dissection . - Estimate optimum cutoff value standardize uptake value diagnostic accuracy PET/CT imaging . - Evaluate impact PET/CT image N0 neck across different tumor subsites ( define anatomic location ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET/CT imaging . Approximately 14 day later , patient undergo unilateral bilateral neck dissection . Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaire baseline 1 , 12 , 24 month surgery . Patients undergo blood tissue sample collection periodically biomarker analysis . Patients follow periodically 2 year surgery .</detailed_description>

The N0 neck either ipsilateral head neck tumor contralateral N0 neck bilateral neck dissection plan CT scan and/or MRI take within past 4 week confirm SCC head neck Simultaneous diagnostic CT PET scan allow ; however , PET use part criterion define N0 neck disease For CT scan and/or MR image institution , ACRIN recommend reread local neuroradiologist ensure compliance No sinonasal cancer , salivary gland cancer , thyroid cancer , nasopharyngeal cancer , advance skin cancer PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Not pregnant nursing Negative pregnancy test Weight ≤ 350 lb No poorly control diabetes ( define fast glucose level &gt; 200 mg/dL ) despite attempt improve glucose control fast duration adjustment medication ( optimally , patient glucose &lt; 150 mg/dL ) No underlie medical condition would preclude surgery ( neck dissection ) PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : See Disease Characteristics</criteria>
