	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving rituximab together combination chemotherapy may kill cancer cell . It yet know combination chemotherapy regimen effective give rituximab treat large B-cell lymphoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well rituximab combination chemotherapy work give without bleomycin sulfate treat patient primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Combination Chemotherapy With Without Bleomycin Sulfate Treating Patients With Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine complete response rate base PET/CT scan criterion patient primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma ( PMLCL ) treat dose-adjusted rituximab , etoposide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , cyclophosphamide , prednisone without bleomycin sulfate . Secondary - To characterize progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient treat regimen . - To assess toxicity profile associate regimens patient . - To determine prognostic significance mid-therapy PET scan end-of-therapy PET scan achieve complete response predict 2-year PFS patient treat regimen . - To explore effect involved-field radiotherapy 2-year PFS patient PET positive end chemotherapy . - To explore efficacy end-of-therapy PET/CT scan predicting patient avoid radiotherapy . - To characterize overall survival patient treat regimen . - To prospectively validate pattern immunohistochemical staining , include nuclear c-REL , TRAF-1 , c-JUN , Gal1 , accurately distinguish PMLCL lymphoid malignancy . - To determine level soluble CD30 correlate disease activity PMLCL . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( EPOCH-R ) : Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 ; etoposide IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , vincristine sulfate IV continuously 96 hour day 1-4 ; cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 5 ; oral prednisone twice daily day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II ( R-VACOP-B ) : Patients receive rituximab IV doxorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1 week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 ; cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 1 week 1 , 5 , 9 ; etoposide IV 1 hour day 1 orally day 2 3 week 3 , 7 , 11 ; bleomycin sulfate IV vincristine sulfate IV day 1 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 ; oral prednisone day 1-7 week 1 every day week 2-10 . In arm , patient undergo PET/CT scan baseline , mid-therapy , completion chemotherapy . Patients stable progressive disease completion chemotherapy remove study . Patients complete response undergo observation . Patients partial response undergo involved-field radiotherapy area bulky disease diagnosis FDG-avid area PET scan 3-4 week completion chemotherapy . These patient undergo additional PET/CT scan 8-10 week completion radiotherapy . Blood sample collect baseline , mid-therapy restaging , completion chemotherapy analysis soluble CD30 level ELISA . Previously collect tissue sample obtain biomarker analysis IHC . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
