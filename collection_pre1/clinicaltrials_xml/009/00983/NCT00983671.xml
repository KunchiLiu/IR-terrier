	<brief_summary>Background : various pediatric pulmonary disease asthma , cystic fibrosis bronchopulmonary dysplasia increase inflammation present . Measuring inflammation often hardly possible require invasive technique bronchoscopy . With use exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) exhale breath ( EB ) analysis possible measure inflammation non-invasive way . However , great need standardise measurement identify possible confound factor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background study : Measurement inflammatory marker ( IM ) exhale breath exhale breath condensate ( EB ( C ) ) interest useful non-invasive new technique evaluate airway inflammation . This technique helpful diagnostic monitoring purpose child adult chronic lung disease . The hypothesis present study standardisation increase reproducibility measurement also enlarge possibility detect difference healthy diseased subject . Objective study : 1. investigate influence various factor concentration marker EB ( C ) ; parameter subject level ( e.g . breathe pattern , nose clip , inspiratory filter , saliva contamination , physical exertion ) , apparatus level ( clean procedure , temperature condenser tube , environmental condition , buffer bag ) , measurement/analysis level ( sampling time , storage time , storage temperature , protein inhibitor bovine serum albumine ) discriminate . 2. ass whether reproducibility measurement EB ( C ) increase analyse ellipsometry , lyophilization standardise exhaled volume , sample time , dilution factor . 3. investigate whether difference inflammatory marker ( IM ) EBC healthy diseased subject increase specific EB ( C ) sample distal airway . Children asthma , cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) , bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , low respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) include . Study design : Part I : Cross-sectional study assess random influence presence absence various factor concentration IM EB ( C ) ; Part II : A short-term prospective study reproducibility five consecutive day ; Part III : A cross-sectional comparative study several group child ( healthy , asthma , CF , PCD , BPD , LRTI ) ; Study population : Study part I II perform healthy adult volunteer . Study part III perform healthy child child asthma , CF , PCD , BPD , LRTI age 2-16 year . Primary study parameters/outcome study : Study part I : Concentration IM EB ( C ) . Study part II : Reproducibility assess coefficient variation IM EB ( C ) . Study part III : Concentration IM EB ( C ) distal proximal airway .</detailed_description>
