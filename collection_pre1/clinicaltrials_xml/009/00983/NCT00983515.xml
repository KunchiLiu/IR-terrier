	<detailed_description>Ritonavir potent inhibitor CYP3A4 , one enzymes responsible metabolism colchicine . This study evaluate effect multiple dos ritonavir pharmacokinetic profile single 0.6 mg dose colchicine . A secondary objective evaluate safety tolerability regimen healthy volunteer . All study subject monitor adverse event throughout study period . After fast least 10 hour , twenty-four healthy , non-smoking , non-obese , non-pregnant adult volunteer age 18 45 give single oral dose colchicine ( 1 x 0.6 mg tablet ) Day 1 . Fasting continue 4 hour dose . Blood sample draw participant dose twenty-four hour post-dose confined basis time sufficient adequately define pharmacokinetics colchicine . Blood sample continue non-confined basis Days 2-5 . After 14 day washout period , study Days 15-18 , subject return clinic daily non-confined dosing ritonavir ( 1 x 100 mg capsule ) every 12 hour . Administered ritonavir dos day necessarily fast state . On Day 15 , take first dose ritonavir , subject remain clinic observation 1 hour post-dose administration . On day 19 fast least 10 hour , single dose colchicine ( 1 x 0.6 mg tablet ) ritonavir ( 1 x 100 mg capsule ) co-administered study participant . Fasting continue 4 hour follow co-administered dos ritonavir colchicine . All participant confine clinic dose 24-hour blood sample time sufficient adequately determine pharmacokinetics colchicine . Blood sample continue non-confined basis Days 20-23 . The final dose ritonavir ( 1 x 100 mg capsule ) administer subject even Day 19 , non-fasting state . A goal study evaluate safety tolerability regimen healthy volunteer . Subjects monitor throughout participation study adverse reaction study drug and/or procedure . Vital sign ( blood pressure pulse ) measure prior dose 1 , 2 , 3 hour follow drug administration Days 1 , 15 19 coincide peak plasma concentration colchicine ritonavir . All adverse event whether elicited query , spontaneously report , observe clinic staff evaluate Investigator report subject 's case report form .</detailed_description>
