	<detailed_description>Introduction : The use nerve stimulation treat control variety medical , psychiatric , neurological disorder see significant growth last several decade . In particular , vagal nerve stimulation ( VNS ) subject considerable research . The vagus nerve extensively innervate thoracic abdominal viscera ( afferent 80 % fibre ) important route information central nervous system ( efferent 20 % fibre ) . One vagus main function monitor control activity internal organ gland heart , lung , stomach , bladder pancreas . Activation parasympathetic pathway lead negative chronotropic , negative dromotropic , negative inotropic change heart . 11 The postganglionic neuron vagus nerve project sinoatrial ( SA ) atrioventricular ( AV ) node , well atrial ventricular musculature . In adult , right vagus nerve innervate predominantly SA node , atrial muscle , much less degree , AV node . On hand , leave vagus nerve innervates SA node atrial muscle lesser degree innervate AV node . However , significant overlap anatomical distribution . Stimulation right vagus slow rate discharge pacemaker cell SA node thus slow SA node rate thereby reduce HR . Stimulation leave vagus nerve produce slow SA node , prolongation AV conduction partial total AV block . Detailed human data vagus nerve stimulation effect heart rate available . The aim present study find clinically acceptable frequency biphasic VNS , could allow gradual decrease heart rate systemic arterial pressure . Methods : Patients undergo carotid end-arterectomy coronary bay-pass surgery include study . Study approve The National Medical Ethics Committee , Ministry Health , Republic Slovenia ( No . 142/02/07 , 13 February 2007 ) . Before trial activity perform , Informed Consent accordance Informed Consent Procedure properly obtain . Design Multi-electrode Spiral Cuff : The self-sizing spiral design choose cuff . A detailed description 39-electrode cuff , thirteen circumferential group three electrode ( GTE 1-13 ) fabrication find previous report . Anesthesia : One hour surgery , patient premedicated orally diazepam 5 mg pantoprazole 40 mg. For induction anesthesia short-acting intravenous anaesthetic agent propofol use dose 1 - 2 mg/kg body weight ( BW ) administer slow bolus dos ( 20 - 30 ) , remifentanyl ( Ultiva , GlaxoSmithKline , GSK Export VB ) short-acting synthetic μ-opioid agonist use initial load dose 1 - 1.5 µg/kg BW administer 30 60 period.To facilitate endotracheal intubation muscle relaxant vecuronium bromide administer intravenously . For maintenance general anesthesia inhalation anesthetic isoflurane use inspired concentration 1.5 3.0 % analgesia assure continuous infusion 0.3 - 0.5 µg/kg/min remifentanyl . Vecuronium bromide administer muscle relaxation high degree need reason . Low-flow anesthetic technique perform continuously inhale fresh gas flow 1.5 L/min oxygen air mixture reach 40 % FiO2 . Patients mechanically ventilate predetermined tidal volume ( VT ) ( 5 - 7 ml/kg BW ) , positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) 3 - 5 cm H2O respiratory rate ( RR ) 12 15 per minute maintain ETCO2 30 35 mm Hg . During maintenance , excessive decrease systemic blood pressure occur due depth anesthesia , correct lightening anaesthesia . To avoid eventual myocardial ischemia , maintenance normal haemodynamics strictly control . ECG Recording : ECG first bipolar limb lead ( Lead I ) record via self-adhesive , disposable pre-gelled Ag/AgCl Monitoring Electrode . Haemodynamic monitoring : Pressure airway open ( Pao ) monitor use transducer invasive blood pressure monitoring attach cuffed endotracheal tube . Invasive systemic arterial pressure ( SAP ) measure transducer attach intra-arterial line place leave right radial artery . The central venous catheter central venous pressure ( CVP ) Swan-Ganz catheter ( Swan-Ganz CCOmbo Pulmonary Artery Catheter Vigilance II Monitor , Edwards Inc. , USA ) continuous cardiac output pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) measurement insert induction general anesthesia via right jugular internal vein . All signal amplify custom design battery power bridge amplifier adjustable gain . All amplified signal , include amplified ECG , feed high-performance data acquisition A/D converter notebook PC . Data store personal computer hard drive off-line reanalysis . Graphical presentation result perform use AxoScope 10.2 , software develop Axon Instruments , Inc. , 3280 Whipple Road , Union City , CA 94587 USA . Cuff implantation : After internal carotid endarterectomy off-pump coronary artery by-pass surgery cuff around leave vagus nerve implant . The vagus nerve pass vertically neck within carotid sheath , lie internal jugular vein internal carotid artery far upper border thyroid cartilage , vein common carotid artery root neck . The course nerve differs two side body . The vagus nerve identify carotid sheath posterior groove carotid artery jugular vein . Vessel loop use mobilize vagus nerve 2.5 3 cm available attachment spiral cuff . After , nerve segment completely free surround tissue cuff carefully attach expose nerve . Since need `` seal '' cuff nerve suture unnecessary , cuff implantation relatively simple operation . Namely , self-fitting nature spiral design make easy fit snug cuff nerve . Furthermore , spiral cuff design devise induce low pressure instal nerve passively-induced nerve damage eliminate . A special care however , take route lead connector avoid much possible mechanical tension transmit cuff . Special care take surgery also avoid cause mechanical trauma recurrent laryngeal nerve . Vagus nerve stimulation : Stimulus Stimulus combination quasi-trapezoidal cathodic rectangular anodic current pulse . Precisely , result current , biphasic charge balance combination compose quasi-trapezoidal cathodic phase square lead edge different intensity ic , plateau tc 300 μs , exponentially decay phase texp 500 μs , follow wide rectangular anodic phase ta alow current magnitude ia . Anodic phase ia one-tenth magnitude cathodic phase . However , width anodic phase ta dependent upon charge inject cathodic phase : great charge , wide anodic phase . Identification Particular Nerve Compartments group tree electrode ( GTE ) Stimuli intensity ic quasi-trapezoidal cathodic phase 2 mA frequency 20 Hz deliver approximately 10 second quasi-bipolarly 13 GTEs within cuff . Stimulation separate GTE perform 1 minute apart . The GTE elicit large change heart rate , namely GTE1 , consider relevant stimulation . Vagus stimulation different frequency increase current Approximately 10-second long pulse train intensity ic 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 3.0 mA different frequency stimulation ( 10Hz , 20Hz 30Hz ) deliver aforementioned GTE1 absence cardiac contraction occur . VNS terminate instantly absence cardiac contraction notice . The time interval different two simulation least 2 minute last till heart rate SAP reach basal value stimulation train . Stimulation record system ECG , SAP , PAP , CVP PAO . Results : We expect find optimal frequency/current relationship selective VNS could allow clinical useful manipulation heart rate systemic arterial pressure .</detailed_description>
