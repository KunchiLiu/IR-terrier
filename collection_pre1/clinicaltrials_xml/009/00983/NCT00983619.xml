Optional : Willing provide fresh tumor sample sufficient quantity archival tumor sample available ( Arms B , C , D ) . See Section 5.3.9 tumor sample detail . 5 . Evaluable/measurable disease NonCLL Bcell malignancy ( Arms A , C , D ) : Histologically confirm Bcell NHL ( FL DLBCL ) , transform indolent lymphoma , MCL : Measurable disease define ≥ 1 lesion ≥ 20 mm one dimension ≥15 mm 2 dimension measure conventional highresolution ( spiral ) compute tomography ( CT ) . For Arms C D : disease evaluable International Working Group criterion ( Cheson et al , 2007 ) Baseline PET PET/CT scan must show positive lesion compatible CTdefined anatomical tumor site ( applicable FL , DLBCL , MCL , transform indolent lymphoma , FL transform DLBCL ) CLL ( Arms A B ) : Confirmed Bcell CLL/SLL characteristic immunophenotype flow cytometry , symptomatic disease require treatment CT scan show involvement ≥ 1clearly demarcated lesion measure ≥ 1.5 cm 6 . Prior therapy Arm A : Histologically confirm Bcell NHL ( FL DLBCL ) : Relapsed refractory ≥ 1 prior regimen contain rituximab , either alone combination , candidate hematopoietic SCT BM transplant Bcell CLL : Relapsed refractory ≥ 2 prior line treatment , ≥ 1 must contain rituximab Arm B : Relapsed refractory ≥ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens ≥ 1 regimen contain rituximab Arm C : Relapsed refractory ≥ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens ≥ 1 regimen contain rituximab fail 1 prior rituximabcontaining regimen unable tolerate additional multiagent chemotherapy Arm D : Refractory ≥ 1 regimen contain antiCD20based therapy , include salvage regimen maintenance rituximab . Refractory subject define subject less PR prior antiCD20based therapy progress within 6 month complete therapy antiCD20based regimen , include maintenance rituximab . These subject must eligible hematopoietic SCT BM transplant 7 . Prior radiation therapy allow provided exposure exceed area 25 % marrow space occur ≥ 6 week prior first dose MEDI551 ( Arm A ) 8 . Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 9 . Life expectancy ≥ 12 week 10 . Adequate hematologic function Arm A ( except CLL subject significant BM involvement biopsy ) must meet following criterion : Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL , ( ≥ 8 g/dL subject transfusion dependent ) Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3 Arms B , C , D must meet following criterion : Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3 In event significant BM involvement , hematologic criterion require enrollment eligibility 11 . Adequate organ function define follow : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2 × institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN except subject document Gilbert 's disease , ≤ 2.5 × ULN ; Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min determine CockcroftGault equation 12 . Female subject childbearing potential sexually active nonsterilized male partner must use highly effective contraception screening must agree continue use precaution least 180 day last dose investigational product . Depending investigational product receive , period may longer . Cessation birth control point discuss responsible physician Females childbearing potential define surgically sterile ( ie , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , complete hysterectomy ) postmenopausal ( defined 12 month menses without alternative medical cause folliclestimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone level consistent menopausal state ) A highly effective method contraception define one result low failure rate ( ie , le 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly . Acceptable method contraception describe Table 4.2.11 . Sustained abstinence acceptable practice ; however , periodic abstinence , rhythm method , withdrawal method acceptable method contraception 13 . Nonsterilized male sexually active female partner childbearing potential must use highly effective method contraception ( Table 4.2.11 ) least Day 1 90 day last dose investigational product 14 . Negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( βhCG ) test ( woman childbearing potential ) 15 . Females female partner childbearing potential must surgically sterilize postmenopausal ( define inclusion criterion # 12 ) . Sterilized male must least 1 year post vasectomy 1 . Any available standard line therapy know lifeprolonging lifesaving 2 . Any concurrent chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic hormonal therapy treatment cancer 3 . History allergy reaction component MEDI551 formulation 4 . Receipt chemotherapy small molecule target therapy ( imatinib tyrosine kinase inhibitor , include experimental therapy ) radiation therapy within 28 day 5 halflives , whichever short , prior first dose MEDI551 5 . Receipt biological immunologicalbased therapy ( include experimental therapy ) leukemia , lymphoma , myeloma ( include , limited , MAb therapy rituximab , cancer vaccine therapy ) within 28 day 5 halflives , whichever short , prior first dose MEDI551 6 . Previous therapy direct CD19 , MAbs MAb conjugate 7 . Live attenuate vaccine ( experimental cancer vaccine therapy ) within 28 day prior receive first dose MEDI551 8 . Evidence significant active infection require antimicrobial , antifungal , antiparasitic , antiviral therapy supportive care give 9 . Autologous SCT within 12 week prior study entry ( Arms A D ) 10 . Prior allogeneic SCT organ transplant ( Arms A D ) 11 . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive serology AIDS 12 . Active hepatitis B define seropositivity hepatitis B surface antigen positive hepatitis B core antibody . Subjects hepatitis C antibody eligible provide elevate liver transaminase 13 . Ongoing ≥ Grade 2 toxicity previous cancer therapy unless specifically allow Inclusion/Exclusion criterion . Use immunosuppressive medication steroid within 28 day first dose MEDI551 14 .
