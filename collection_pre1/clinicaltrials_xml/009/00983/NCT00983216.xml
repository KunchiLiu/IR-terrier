	<detailed_description>Ketoconazole potent inhibitor cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 enzyme system , one enzyme system responsible metabolism colchicine . This study evaluate effect multiple dos ketoconazole pharmacokinetic profile single 0.6 mg dose colchicine . A secondary objective evaluate safety tolerability regimen healthy volunteer . All study subject monitor adverse event throughout study period . After fast least 10 hour , twenty-four healthy , non-smoking , non-obese , non-pregnant adult volunteer age 18 45 year give one dose colchicine ( 1 x 0.6 mg tablet ) orally Day 1 . Fasting continue 4 hour dose . Blood sample draw participant dose twenty-four hour post-dose confined basis time sufficient adequately define pharmacokinetics colchicine . Blood sample continue non-confined basis Days 2-5 . On Days 15-18 , subject return clinic daily non-confined dosing ketoconazole ( 1 x 200 mg tablet ) twice daily , every 12 hour . Administered ketoconazole dos day necessarily fast state . On Day 15 , take first dose ketoconazole , subject remain clinic observation 1 hour post-dose administration . Then , Day 19 , co-administration single dose colchicine ( 1 x 0.6 mg tablet ) ketoconazole ( 1 x 200 mg tablet ) occur follow fast least 10 hour subject confine clinic dose 24-hour blood sampling perform time sufficient adequately determine pharmacokinetics colchicine . Blood sample continue non-confined basis Days 20-23 . Fasting continue 4 hour follow co-administered dose ketoconazole colchicine . The final dose ketoconazole ( 1 x 200 mg tablet ) administer subject even Day 19 , non-fasting state . A goal study evaluate safety tolerability regimen healthy volunteer . Subjects monitor throughout participation study adverse reaction study drug and/or procedure . Vital sign ( blood pressure pulse ) measure prior dose 1 , 2 , 3 hour follow drug administration Days 1 19 coincide peak plasma concentration colchicine ketoconazole . All adverse event whether elicited query , spontaneously report , observe clinic staff , evaluate Investigator report subject 's case report form .</detailed_description>
