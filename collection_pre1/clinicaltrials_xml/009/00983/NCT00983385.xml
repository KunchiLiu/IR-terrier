	<brief_summary>The main objective study evaluate effectiveness , tolerability , safety tapentadol hydrochloride prolong release subject suffer severe chronic low back pain ( LBP ) take either WHO Step I Step II analgesic regular analgesic . This clinical effectiveness trial design establish link anticipated clinical outcome clinical practice mean select measure clinical subject-reported outcome . The trial compare effectiveness previous analgesic treatment ( either WHO Step I Step II analgesic regular analgesic ) tapentadol hydrochloride prolonged release ( PR ) treatment define period evaluation .</brief_summary>

Participants must appropriately communicative verbalize differentiate regard location intensity pain . Participants must least 18 year age . Participants must diagnosis chronic low back pain ; chronic pain define pain last least 3 month . If participant radicular pain , must present least 3 month stable 4 week enrollment . Participants 's pain must require strong analgesic ( define WHO Step III ) judge Investigator . Participants must report rate satisfaction previous analgesic regimen exceed `` fair '' subject satisfaction treatment scale ( 5point VRS ) . If regular , daily pretreatment : Participants must take WHO Step I Step II analgesic medication daily basis least 2 week prior Screening Visit . The Investigator considers dose increase WHO Step I analgesics ( mono combination therapy ) and/or continuation dose increase WHO Step II analgesic inadequate individual participant , whatever applicable . Participants must average pain intensity score ( NRS 3 ) great 5 point last 3 day prior Screening Visit . If regular analgesic pretreatment report : Participants must average pain intensity score ( NRS3 ) great 6 point last 3 day prior Screening Visit relate low back pain . Presence clinically significant disease laboratory finding Investigator 's opinion may affect efficacy safety assessment . Presence active systemic local infection may , opinion Investigator , affect efficacy , quality life/function safety assessment . History alcohol drug abuse , suspicion Investigator 's judgement . Presence concomitant autoimmune inflammatory condition . Known history laboratory value reflect severe renal impairment . Known history moderately severely impaired hepatic function . History active hepatitis B C within past 3 month history HIV infection History seizure disorder epilepsy . Any follow within 1 year : mild/moderate traumatic brain injury , stroke , transient ischemic attack , brain neoplasm . Severe traumatic brain injury within 15 year ( consist 1 following : brain contusion , intracranial hematoma , either unconsciousness posttraumatic amnesia last 24 h ) residual sequela suggest transient change consciousness .

Participants suspect paralytic ileus . Employees Investigator trial site , direct involvement trial trial direction Investigator trial site , well family member employee Investigator . Participation another trial concurrently within 4 week prior Screening Visit . Known suspect able comply protocol use investigational medicinal product . Use monoamine oxidase inhibitor within 14 day Screening Visit . Nonstable dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor within 30 day Screening Visit ( dose must remain stable trial ) . Presence condition low back pain could confound assessment self evaluation pain , e.g. , anatomical deformity , significant skin condition abscess syndrome widespread pain fibromyalgia . Any concomitant painful condition could interfere subject 's trial assessment ability differentiate low back pain painful condition . Any painful procedure trial ( e.g. , major surgery ) may , opinion Investigator , affect efficacy safety assessment . Pending litigation due chronic pain disability . Intake Step III analgesic within 30 day prior Screening Visit .</criteria>
