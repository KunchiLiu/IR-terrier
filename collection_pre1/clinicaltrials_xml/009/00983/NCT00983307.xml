	<brief_title>A Study Erlotinib Plus Radiotherapy ( RT ) Patients With Advanced Inoperable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis/Rationale : Lung cancer number one cause cancer-related mortality men woman United States , 170,000 case diagnose annually . The overall 5-year survival rate remain 14 % despite decade clinical research . Thoracic RT standard treatment locally advance ( Stage III ) NSCLC , combination chemotherapy favorable patient . Metastatic lung cancer ( Stage IV ) treat systemic chemotherapy , addition RT palliation tumor symptom . Most lung cancer present large tumor , measure 2 7 cm large dimension . It therefore difficult understand 16 % patient experience complete resolution irradiate tumor within 3 month follow course standard fractionate ( 2.0 Gy daily ) RT chemotherapy . From basic principle advocate Fletcher , think standard fractionate RT dose 100.0 Gy may necessary sterilize tumor size frequently encounter clinical practice . Tumor control probability bronchogenic carcinoma estimate 10 % tumor great 4 cm dose 80.0 Gy , assumption , average-size lung cancer may require dos beyond 100.0 Gy standard fractionate 50 % 80 % probability control tumor . This demonstrate `` stereotactic radioablation '' approach patient medically inoperable Stage I NSCLC , 20 Gy per fraction total 60 Gy ( BED equivalent &gt; 100 Gy ) result excellent local control &gt; 90 % ( Timmerman R et al , 2006 ; Onishi H et al , 2007 ) . Hypofractionated RT : It generally accept presence chronically hypoxic cell within tumor may important cause radioresistance resultant local failure radiotherapy , particularly large solid tumor locoregionally advance NSCLC . In-vitro experiment indicate dose need kill severely hypoxic cell order 2 3 time dose need oxic cell . Therefore , deliver high RT dose tumor may result high tumor cell kill improve local control . One approach increase RT dose use hypofractionated RT , increase dose , also reduce overall treatment time . The radiobiological rationale hypofractionated RT describe Mehta et al ( Mehta et al , 2001 ) . Based theoretical assumption , University Wisconsin recently complete dose escalation study progressively increase fraction size thoracic RT lung cancer . Such large RT fraction size may require `` tight '' radiation field ( achieve reliable normal-tissue sparing ) improve precision RT delivery , something afford SBF ( Stereotactic Body Frame ) immobilization daily CT scan base image verification tumor position . More experience report literature hypofractionated regimen lung cancer . Japanese investigator ( Nagata Y et al , 2002 ) treat 40 patient T1-T3N0 tumor lung metastasis 10-12 Gy per fraction total 40-48 Gy . No pulmonary ( ) complication &gt; Grade 2 observe local control 100 % subgroup primary lung tumor . Another group Japan ( Onimaru R et al , 2003 ) report 45 patient primary lung tumor 6cm receive 7.5 Gy per fraction 60 Gy ( lesion &lt; 3cm ) 6 Gy per fraction 48 Gy ( lesion 3-6cm ) . One patient central tumor die radiation-induced ulcer esophagus . One patient peripheral lesion experience Grade 2 chest wall pain . The 3-year local control rate 80 % . No adverse respiratory event note . The `` ultimate '' hypofractionated RT regimen 60 Gy give 3 fraction 20 Gy demonstrate feasible highly effective patient medically inoperable Stage I NSCLC tumor measure 7 cm locate outside central airway ( Timmerman et al , 2006 ) . However , regimen associate high incidence severe toxicity applied central airway . Since tumor patient Stage III IV NSCLC locate centrally , novel hypofractionated regimen need develop specifically . In institution complete Phase I/II investigator-initiated trial dose-escalated hypofractionated RT give concurrently Gefitinib ( Iressa ) Gefitinib continue RT completion progression toxicity . Three RT dose level apply : 4.2 Gy 10 fraction 42 Gy ; 4.2 Gy 12 fraction 50.4 Gy 4.2 Gy 15 fraction 63 Gy . Eligible pt either Stage III IV NSCLC need thoracic RT could receive chemotherapy . No selection EGFR receptor status apply . A total 12 patient enrol . Main toxicity pulmonary ( 1 grade 2 pneumonitis ; 1 grade 3 infectious pneumonia ; 1 grade 4 pneumonitis ) . There 1 grade 3 abdominal pain . One patient ( thoracic tumor control ) die due late radiation-esophageal toxicity ( tracheo-esophageal fistula set pre-existing esophageal diverticulum ) 12 month RT . Only one patient experience local progression irradiate tumor , encourage may support hypothesis radiosensitizing effect EGFR inhibitor . As , median survival time 12 enrol patient 9 month ( range : 1-26 mo ) time initiate Gefitinib , encourage result mostly pretreated patient , many metastatic disease ( Werner-Wasik et al , oral presentation , First ESMO/IASLC European Meeting Lung Cancer , Geneva , Switzerland , April 2008 ) . Since Gefitinib available wider use , propose study erlotinib hypofractionated RT Phase II set main objective assess efficacy combination . There direct evidence patient receive concurrent EGFR inhibitor RT need pre-selected regard EGFR status . In recent study ( Bentzen SM et al , 2005 ) , positive immunohistochemical stain EGFR status associate benefit locoregional control patient head neck cancer receive CHART ( continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy ) , EGFR status effect survival rate distant metastasis . Therefore , propose investigate EGFR status eligible patient , treat without selection EGFR status . Tarceva ( previously know OSI-774 ) orally active , potent , selective inhibitor EGFR tyrosine kinase . Early clinical data Tarceva indicate compound generally safe well tolerated dos provide target effective concentration base nonclinical experiment . A recently complete , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial ( BR.21 ) show Tarceva single agent significantly improve survival patient incurable Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC fail standard therapy advance metastatic disease ( Shepherd F et al , 2000 2005 ) . In Phase II clinical trial ( Jackman D et al , 2007 ) 80 chemotherapy-naive patient &gt; 70 year age advance non-small cell lung cancer receive erlotinib first-line therapy , encourage median survival time ( MST ) 10.9 month report , presence EGFR mutation strongly correlate disease control survival . In summary , combination erlotinib hypofractionated thoracic RT potential significantly improve local tumor control patient non-small-cell lung cancer , base theoretical consideration EGFR inhibition , increase tumor cell kill large RT fraction preclinical evidence synergism RT erlotinib . Our hypothesis addition erlotinib RT result radiosensitization , therefore increase likelihood local tumor control RT alone . Maintenance erlotinib upon RT completion result tumor growth inhibition , systemically locally , lengthen disease-free survival overall survival . All eligible patient enrol , without regard EGFR status . The implication prospectively screen patient EGFR mutation gene copy number patient select subsequent treatment remain define ( Janne P et al , 2005 ; Shepherd f et al , 2005 ) . Therefore , patient exclude trial participation base EGFR test . The EGFR status assess FISH assay biopsy resection tissue sample test perform commercial laboratory .</detailed_description>
