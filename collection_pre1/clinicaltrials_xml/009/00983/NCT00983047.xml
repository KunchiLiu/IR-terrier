	<brief_summary>Nimotuzumab humanize monoclonal anti-body target epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . Clinical trial ongoing globally evaluate nimotuzumab different indication . Nimotuzumab demonstrate unique clinical profile , anti-tumor activity observe absence severe skin , renal , gastrointestinal mucosa toxicity commonly associate EGFR-targeting antibody . Nimotuzumab grant approval use squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) , glioma nasopharyngeal cancer many country . The investigator compare docetaxel plus nimotuzumab docetaxel alone chemotherapy-refractory/resistant patient advance EGFR-positive non-small-cell lung cancer ass efficacy safety .</brief_summary>
