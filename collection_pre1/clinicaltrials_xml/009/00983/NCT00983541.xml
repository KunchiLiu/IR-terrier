	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES : This study propose evaluate feasibility delivery treatment term toxicity . If toxicity acceptable , treatment feasible . Primary Objectives - To establish preliminary assessment whether toxicity rate acceptable patient locally advance intra extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treat regimen gemcitabine every two week continuous fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) give concurrently external beam radiation therapy total dose 45 gray ( Gy ) , follow brachytherapy Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) boost . Secondary Objectives - To evaluate overall survival rate , progression free survival rate , tumor response rate , local control rate rate distant metastasis follow gemcitabine continuous 5-FU concurrent radiation therapy patient locally advance intra extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma . - To evaluate rate patient unresectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma become resectable follow gemcitabine radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cholangiocarcinoma uncommon tumor arise biliary tract . It stratify two category base location , intrahepatic extrahepatic . In United States , approximately 4,000-5,000 case cholangiocarcinoma diagnose year . The common location bifurcation common hepatic duct classify extrahepatic , also know Klatskin tumor . Approximately 60-80 % tumor find perihilar location . A history primary sclerosing cholangitis confers 10 % lifetime risk develop cholangiocarcinoma . Other know risk factor include ulcerative colitis , liver fluke infestation , hepatolithiasis , thorotrast exposure choledochal cyst . Cholecystectomy decrease risk . Most patient lymph node positive diagnosis , approach 55-60 % , less half resectable diagnosis . Because rare nature tumor , limited prospective trial address role surgery , chemotherapy ( CT ) radiation therapy ( RT ) treatment cholangiocarcinoma . Despite advance surgical radiotherapy technique , prognosis cholangiocarcinoma remain dismal . Historically , survival poor 0-10 % 5-year survival . In recent year , median survival 2-15 month expect . Patients able undergo surgical resection diagnosis longer survival approximately 20-24 month . Recent investigation area neoadjuvant chemoradiation follow orthotopic liver transplant select group patient report promise result , 1- , 3- 5-year overall survival 92 % , 82 % 82 % , respectively . Although approach may appropriate select patient , namely young patient small tumor , limited nodal involvement , encasement major vasculature , majority patient present cholangiocarcinoma present unresectable disease initial diagnosis , often due nodal involvement . Chemotherapy The role chemotherapy ( CT ) cholangiocarcinoma establish . Most chemotherapy trial small single institution phase II trial , large prospective randomize trial . Additionally , chemotherapy trial include patient intrahepatic , extrahepatic gallbladder carcinoma , well patient locally advance metastatic disease . Response rate range 0-40 % complete remission . The extensively investigated CT agent 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , disappointing response rate 9 % single agent . Response rate improve addition streptozotocin methyl-CCNU ( Semustine ) 5-FU randomized trial perform Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) .6 Multiple combination CT regimens investigate small clinical trial , none show survival benefit . Gemcitabine show promise potential chemotherapeutic agent treatment cholangiocarcinoma . A multicenter retrospective analysis Japan examine multitude different CT regimens patient intrahepatic , extrahepatic gallbladder carcinoma report gemcitabine effective treatment , reduction mortality 50 % .7 Fifty-eight patient 413 identify study treat gemcitabine , 6.9 % show partial response , 50 % remain stable , 39.7 % progressed despite therapy . Median survival 8.05 month hazard ratio ( HR ) 0.50 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.35-0.72 ) . Sixteen 58 patient treated gemcitabine extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma . In numerous phase II trial gemcitabine single agent , response rate range 6-30 % , great 50 % treated patient either partial response stable disease . 7-12 Median survival ( MS ) range 6.5-14 month trial . In 2008 , guideline CT biliary tract cancer publish Journal Hepatobiliary Pancreatic Surgery.13 Seven trial use gemcitabine single agent identify , response rate range 0-36 % MS range 4.6-14 month . In article use gemcitabine unresectable cancer biliary tract give recommendation level C1 , mean use may consider , although lack high-level evidence.13 The combination 5-FU 's oral analog capecitabine gemcitabine chemotherapy alone ( without radiation ) advance metastatic set improved response rate median overall survival around 10 % 6.1 month 10-36 % 9.7 14 month respectively.13a Based data likely synergy agent give concurrently external beam RT . The combination continuous 5-FU gemcitabine external beam radiation locally advanced pancreatic cancer show safe result complete response 2 patient ( 6.3 % ) , partial response 18 patient ( 56.3 % ) , overall response rate 62.5 % 13b . Based data similar dose external RT therapy seem reasonable safe combine two agent 5-FU gemcitabine RT advance cholangiocarcinoma . We choose use 5-FU rather oral capecitabine due occasional problem obtain prescription coverage expensive alternative prior available safety data institutional experience use 5-FU gemcitabine combination RT pancreatic cancer . Radiation Therapy Data use radiation therapy ( RT ) alone set unresectable disease sparse . In report Johns Hopkins , total 23 patient treated surgical procedure follow RT.14 Complete resection accomplish 14 patient palliative stenting 9 . Postoperative RT dose range 45-63 Gy deliver external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) follow brachytherapy boost EBRT cone boost . RT effect overall survival patient undergone complete resection patient treat palliative intent . Of note , none patient study treated concurrent chemotherapy . The subgroup patient stented treated palliative RT applies current investigational study group , subset patient survival benefit RT alone . Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy Because success combine CT RT gastrointestinal cancer , unsuccessful attempt CT RT alone , multimodality treatment apply cholangiocarcinoma . There limited data use EBRT combination 5-FU specifically extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma . In retrospective review , Kim et al look ≥40 Gy EBRT concomitant bolus 5-FU ( 500mg/m2 ) first 3-days two week radiation , follow monthly maintenance chemo 5-FU one year.15 Eighty four patient include , 72 gross total resection ( 47 negative margin , 25 microscopically positive margin ) remain 12 palliative procedure prior chemoradiation . The 5-year survival 31 % . Although trial specifically look postoperative chemoradiotherapy , subset patient undergo gross total resection would apply study population . The 5-year actuarial survival 14 % overall subgroup .</detailed_description>
