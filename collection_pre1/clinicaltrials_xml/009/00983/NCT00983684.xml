	<brief_title>Comparison Intra-operative Radiotherapy With Post-operative Radiotherapy Women With Early Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TARGIT international randomise clinical trial design test hypothesis strategy deliver single dose target intraoperative radiotherapy ( IORT ) patient eligible breast conserving therapy ( addition whole breast radiotherapy patient high risk recurrence elsewhere breast [ e.g . lobular carcinoma extensive intraductal component ] ) equivalent conventional course post-operative external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) . The primary endpoint local loco-regional recurrence rate . It pragmatic trial participate centre option define restrictive entry criterion core protocol . Only centre access IntrabeamÂ® ( Carl Zeiss ) enter patient trial . Eligible patient tumours good prognosis suitable breast conserving surgery . After give consent patient randomise either IORT EBRT . They may receive adjuvant treatment deem necessary , except neoadjuvant therapy . The protocol require patient follow six monthly interval five year annually .</detailed_description>

Available regular followup least ten year . Note : Individual centre may wish restrict entry exactly define subset patient , case , patient characteristic may enter particular centre . For example , centre may decide outset recruit woman 50 even 65 year age . Such policy must predefined write approved International Steering Committee . Exclusion criteria More one obvious cancer breast diagnose clinical examination , mammography ultrasonography . Bilateral breast cancer time diagnosis . Ipsilateral breast previous cancer and/or irradiation .

Patients present gross nodal disease , consider clinically malignant prove cytologically scan . In general , 4 positive node extranodal spread suitable Targit alone receive EBRT well . However , individual centre may decide anything micrometastasis receive EBRT . Patients severe concomitant disease may limit life expectancy . Previous history malignant disease preclude entry expectation relapsefree survival 10 year 90 % great . Any factor include exclusion criterion local centre 's Treatment Policy .
