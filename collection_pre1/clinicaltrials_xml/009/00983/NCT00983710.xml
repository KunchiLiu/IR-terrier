	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer recently surpass lung cancer become common cancer American men . The estimated number new prostate cancer case 2005 expect 232,090 , 198,000 2002 . Prostate cancer represent 29 % new cancer diagnose men comparable incidence breast cancer woman . Prostate cancer continue disproportionately affect minority men . For patient early , localized prostate cancer , number treatment option , include surgical removal prostate , radiation therapy ( external beam implantation radioactive `` seed '' ) , hormonal therapy , cryoablation , expectant monitoring ( `` watchful waiting '' ) .

The intervention base biopsychosocial model prostate cancer symptom management develop general UCSF Symptom Management Model ( SMM ) Bandura 's Self-Efficacy Theory . The efficacy intervention evaluate 200 men localize prostate cancer randomize receive either new tailor symptom management program usual care . Participants intervention control group receive booklet cop cancer available patient treat UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center . Intervention group participant also receive new symptom management intervention tailor individual symptom profile . Both group follow 6 month enrollment , assessment enrollment 5 additional timepoints . The propose research project include follow specific aim : 1 . Conduct RCT evaluate tailor symptom management intervention target low literacy men localize prostate cancer . The investigator hypothesize men receive tailor symptom management intervention ( N=100 ) report significantly less symptom distress 6-month follow-up men control condition ( N=100 ) . Symptom distress measure Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite ( EPIC ) Urinary Bother Sexual Bother sub-scales . The intervention control group stratify literacy level type prostate cancer treatment . 2 . Complete plan training experience include course responsible conduct research , symptom management , cancer care , cancer prevention , cancer epidemiology , clinical research diverse community , longitudinal analysis method provide knowledge skill necessary successfully conduct RCT . 3 . Assemble group key personnel expertise necessary guide training experience RCT . The primary mentor Leslie Schover , PhD , expert cancer symptom management . Other key personnel include Stephen J. Lepore , PhD , Principal Investigator previous prostate cancer psychosocial intervention study ; Brian J .
