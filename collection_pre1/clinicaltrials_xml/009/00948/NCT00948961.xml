	<brief_title>A Study CDX-1401 Patients With Malignancies Known Express NY-ESO-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NY-ESO-1 protein often make type tumor cell , make type normal cell . Because primarily make cancer cell , NY-ESO-1 protein promise target stimulate immune response may destroy cancer cell . CDX-1401 cancer vaccine specially design create type immune response . To enhance immune response , CDX-1401 give 1 2 immune stimulant call Resiquimod poly-ICLC ( Hiltonol ) . This clinical trial include Phase 1 Phase 2 segment . During Phase 1 segment , six group 6 24 patient treated different dose level CDX-1401 combination either one immune stimulant ( Resiquimod and/or poly-ICLC ) . This phase study test safety profile vaccine treatment , ass dose test future study . During Phase 2 segment , 14 patient whose cancer test positive NY-ESO-1 protein laboratory testing , receive study treatment determine effect cancer . All patient enrol either part study may continue receive study treatment disease progress necessary stop treatment safety reason . In addition , patient `` follow '' 24 month enrollment order collect survival information .</detailed_description>
