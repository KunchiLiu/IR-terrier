	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy CEM-102 Compared Linezolid Acute Bacterial Skin Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ABSSIs common affect age group . In recent year , ABSSIs cause multi-drug resistant pathogen , especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) become common . There urgent need additional antibacterial drug mode action different currently available . CEM-102 one agent excellent activity S. aureus , include MRSA .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis acute bacterial skinstructure infection ( ABSSI ) 7 day duration suspect proven cause , least part , grampositive pathogen . Eligible infection include cellulitis measure least 10 cm length width 100 cm square , without focal abscess , surgical traumatic wound infection Infection opinion investigator require 1014 day antibacterial therapy . Have least 3 follow local and/or systemic symptom and/or sign infection : purulent seropurulent drainage/discharge , erythema , fluctuance , heat/localized warmth , pain/tenderness palpation , swelling/induration , regional lymph node swell tenderness , temperature &gt; =100.4 degree F , increase white blood cell count , bandemia . Must receive treatment another systemic antibiotic current ABSSI . Superficial skin structure infection folliculitis , carbuncle , furunculosis , cutaneous abscess , simple cellulitis . Infections involve burn , human animal bite , chronic diabetic foot ulcer . Suspected polymicrobial infection involve Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anticipated need &gt; 14 day antibiotic therapy . Infections complicate presence prosthetic material remove , permanent cardiac pacemaker battery pack , mesh , joint replacement prosthesis . Known significant renal , hepatic , hematologic impairment . Received prior potentially effective antimicrobial therapy acute bacterial skin skin structure infection , unless fail therapy 48 hour grampositive pathogen nonsusceptible prior therapy identify causative pathogen .</criteria>
