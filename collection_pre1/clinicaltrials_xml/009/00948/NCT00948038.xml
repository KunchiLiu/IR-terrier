	<brief_title>Dairy Modulation Oxidative Inflammatory Stress Overweight Obese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity associate sub-clinical chronic oxidative inflammatory stress , major contributor obesity-associated co-morbidities . Calcitriol ( 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2-D3 ) regulate adipocyte lipid metabolism , dietary calcium inhibits obesity suppression calcitriol . We recently show calcitriol increase oxidative stress stimulate expression release inflammatory cytokine , inhibit expression release anti-inflammatory cytokine . We also show inhibition calcitriol high calcium diet decrease adipose tissue systemic oxidative inflammatory stress mouse model obesity . Moreover , dairy exert great effect oxidative inflammatory stress . These mouse also exhibit significant reduction adiposity , could lead confounding , reduction independently reduce oxidative inflammatory stress . However , support cellular/mechanistic data indicate effect independent adiposity reduction . Consequently , propose low calcium diet exacerbate oxidative inflammatory stress high dairy diet attenuate independently change adiposity , thereby significantly reduce risk obesity-associated co-morbidities . Accordingly , objective study determine acute effect dairy-rich diet oxidative inflammatory stress overweight obese subject absence change adiposity . Twenty subject ( 10 obese 10 overweight ) undergo randomize crossover study low dairy high dairy eucaloric diet . Each dietary period four week , two dietary period separate four-week washout period . Primary outcome circulate index oxidative stress inflammation . Secondary outcome include blood pressure , circulate glucose , insulin , lipid , calcium-regulatory hormone body composition .</detailed_description>
