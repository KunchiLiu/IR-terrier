	<brief_title>Insulin Dose Titration System Using Short Messaging Service ( SMS ) Automatically Produced Knowledge Matrix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most patient type 2 diabetes , time , need insulin therapy . Starting insulin pose considerable challenge . Also , improve glycemic control insulin therapy often require periodic dose adjustment base glycemic response . Therefore , adjust insulin dos important improvement glycemic control . Long act insulin offer benefit consistent pharmacological dynamic less hypoglycemia . Therefore , long act insulin dose adjustment widely use patient base simplified insulin dose algorithm . In management diabetes , important maintain intimate continuous doctor-patient relationship . To achieve optimal glucose level prevent diabetic complication , frequent contact medical doctor recommend , cause increase amount medical expense . In recent year , web phone delivery self-management program emerge popular approach management diabetes . The major focus system support blood glucose monitoring substantive feedback expert help interpret result glucose-level value . Moreover , system patient could advise determine amount insulin require . However , despite use program , take significant amount effort time physician look patient 's data , formulate appropriate message , send patient . Accordingly , computerized , knowledge-based medical treatment advice system provide abundant medical advice , also economic previous system , medical personnel require process . Recently design Internet-based diabetic patient management use short message service ( SMS ) automatically produce knowledge matrix . Moreover , report unique system show great efficacy glucose control . In study , design system patient treat long acting insulin produce automatic adjustment insulin dose base real time glucose level data provide patient need insulin dose use SMS apply clinical practice diabetic patient .</detailed_description>
