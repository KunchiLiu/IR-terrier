	<brief_summary>The durg vorinostat ( Zolinza ) type drug call histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor . It inhibit group enzyme call histone deacetylases . These enzyme help cancer cell survive . By inhibit enzyme , vorinostat help kill cancer cell . In research study vorinostat give along radiation therapy drug 5-FU . This first research study vorinostat give along radiation therapy 5-FU . The purpose research study find high dose vorinostat give safely along radiation therapy 5-FU . The investigator also begin get information whether vorinostat combine radiation 5-FU may help treat pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
