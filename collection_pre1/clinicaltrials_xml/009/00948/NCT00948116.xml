	<brief_title>Development Biomarker Panel Earlier Prediction Acute Kidney Injury Patients With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus important risk factor development contrast induce nephropathy ( CIN ) , act 'risk multiplier ' , amplify risk acute kidney injury patient . There important prognostic implication follow development CIN associate significantly increase mortality 1 year . Diabetes major risk factor coronary disease patient often significant co−morbidities . Currently creatinine use ass risk often lag behind clinical status . There press need development novel , specific biomarkers improve detection treatment CIN improve patient outcome high risk population . This single centre , study diabetic patient already undergo plan procedure , , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . They patient deem enhanced risk contrast induce nephropathy virtue diabetic renal status , latter define reduced eGFR marker renal disease base creatinine characteristic patient . No additional intervention part routine clinical care undertaken patient . We identify natural biomarkers obtain serum urine sample patient . From retrospective audit cardiac catheter lab database review literature estimate sample size approximately 250 patient DM CKD ( eGFR &lt; 60 ml/ml ) need . We envisage encounter least 50 case CIN cohort . ( base expect incidence CIN 15−30 % group ) . Looking study rate difference least 25 % , power 95 % confidence interval 95 % ( Fleiss correction ) need least 204 evaluable patient ( avoid Type 2 error ) . In view potential drop−out 10−15 % therefore intend recruit 250 patient By use C statistic ( Receiver operator curve analysis ) able confirm otherwise either particular biomarker combination several biomarkers within 18 hour procedure increase predictive power CIN develop 72 hour later . As part normal care patient arrive hospital morning plan PCI . They point day undergo PCI . Blood urine take prior procedure 2 hour , 4 hour , 8 12 hour , pre discharge 3 day PCI . We analyse sample use ELISA technique correlate biomarkers creatinine explore biomarkers panel biomarkers may able diagnose contrast induced nephropathy early creatinine currently .</detailed_description>
