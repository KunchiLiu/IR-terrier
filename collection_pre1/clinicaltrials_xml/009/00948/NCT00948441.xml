	<detailed_description>Central venous catheter ( CVCs ) crucial patient require long term vascular access due variety underlying disease . Children intestinal insufficiency disease require vascular access receive total parenteral nutrition , chemotherapy , fluid support convenience avoid peripheral stick multiple blood draw require . While catheter many benefit , also associate complication catheter-related bloodstream infection ( CRBSI ) . These infection major cause morbidity , mortality , increase health care cost . Coagulase-negative staphylococci , Staphylococcus aureus , aerobic gram-negative bacillus , Candida specie ( especially albicans ) common organism responsible infection . These infection traditionally treat systemic antimicrobial therapy . There time catheter must remove adequately treat infection , however , indication catheter removal child controversial . For child history multiple line infection , limited site available place new vascular access CVC need replace . Reducing number infection group child highly desirable . The goal study improve patient outcomes reduce risk infection , thereby decrease waitlist morbidity mortality improve post transplant care . Lock therapy procedure allow medication dwell line extend period time without interruption . Many different agent ethanol , vancomycin gentamicin use successfully mean salvage CVC become infected . There limited information regard use lock therapy prevent CRBSI patient CVCs . However , patient history multiple CRBSI , critical need maintain vascular access , lock therapy solution 25 % ethanol suggest prevent future CRBSI . There sufficient data suggest combination likely effective , unlikely lead development multidrug resistant organism well tolerate . Our hypothesis use ethanol lock therapy reduce number CRBSI pre post transplant patient intestinal insufficiency . Specific Aim : To compare number CRBSI patient receive ethanol lock therapy number infection placebo lock therapy heparin . This accomplish conduct prospective cross-over , double blind , placebo control study child intestinal insufficiency history multiple CRBSIs . Each child receive 3 month study lock therapy ( 25 % ethanol ) 3 month placebo lock therapy ( heparin ) . The investigator , patient family blind treatment . The primary outcome measure number CRBSIs . Patients also observe possible side effect therapy , need line removal . This pilot study provide preliminary data information regard feasibility large , multi-center study ethanol lock therapy prevention CRBSI .</detailed_description>
