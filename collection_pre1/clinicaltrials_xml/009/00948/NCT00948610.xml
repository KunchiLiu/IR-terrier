	<brief_summary>More half rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patient complain sleep disturbance cardinal complaint associate fatigue , pain , depress mood patient chronic inflammatory disorder . Despite frequency complain , limited effort evaluate sleep abnormal increase expression proinflamatory cytokine play key role progression RA , hypothesize cytokine network one physiological system associate sleep disturbance RA patient . Proinflamatory cytokines signal central nervous system associate increase symptom pain , fatigue , depress mood rheumatic patient . Moreover , sleep loss coincident alteration sympathetic tone , think contribute increase proinflammatory cytokine activity . The specific aim study examine contribution cytokine sleep administer TNF antagonist vs. placebo probe action proinflammatory cytokine sleep RA Patients . Examination sleep consequence autonomic function proinflamatory cytokine activity within framework observational experimental research design implication understand psycho-biological mechanism link sleep clinical manifestation RA . Results study guide development intervention target disordered sleep potential effect disability RA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sleep Immunity Rheumatoid Arthritis : Remicade Substudy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abnormal sleep report half rheumatoid arthritis patient , addition traditional symptom associate disease , morning stiffness , pain , functional debility . When record brain activity sleep use electroencephalography EEG . Sleep abnormality find independent pain thus mechanisms account disorder sleep population unknown . The immune system , via pro-inflammatory cytokine , play major role development rheumatoid arthritis . Pro-inflammatory cytokine molecule act signal stimulate activity different arm immune system . New medication remicade ( infliximab ) develop slow disease activity block activity pro-inflammatory cytokine . This do binding cytokine TNF render biologically inactive . Proinflammatory cytokine also appear play role sleep . A number basic human study find cytokine sleep exhibit bi-directional relationship . However , study date explore relationship rheumatoid arthritis population . Thus , research study potential test whether cytokine influence sleep rheumatoid arthritis . We determine single dose pro-inflammatory cytokine block medication ( remicade ) affect sleep rheumatoid arthritis patient . Interested participant undergo eligibility interview review in-depth subject participation , RA diagnosis , write Consent . Following eligibility , patient undergo single overnight sleep assessment last four night General Clinical Research Center . After adaption baseline night , day 3 , patient randomize receive either 10 mg/kg remicade placebo sleep subsequently monitor two additional night ( post-infusion 1 post-infusion 2 ) . Participants follow-up three month either remicade placebo infusion . In way , effect block pro-inflammatory cytokine examine sleep , morning stiffness , pain fatigue .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Rheumatoid arthritis patient meet American College Rheumatology revise criterion ( Arnett , Edworthy et al . 1988 ) . This require least four follow seven criterion : 1 ) morning joint stiffness ; 2 ) arthritis 3 joint area ; 3 ) arthritis hand joint ; 4 ) symmetric arthritis ; 5 ) rheumatoid nodule ; 6 ) presence serum rheumatoid factor 7 ) change posteroanterior hand wrist radiograph . In addition , criterion 14 must present least four week . Subjects must 18 85 year age . 2 . If rheumatoid arthritis patient receive treatment traditional disease modify antirheumatic drug ( DMARD ) , methotrexate , sulfasalazine hydroxychloroquine , must stable regime one month study stable throughout study . 3 . If rheumatoid arthritis patient receive treatment TNF antagonist biologic medication , must drug free great 3 month . 1 . Steroids Individuals currently take great equivalent 10 mg prednisone exclude give potent antiinflammatory effect medication . 2 . Opioids Individuals use multiple daily dosage schedule opioid agent oxycodone ( Percocet ) , hydrocodone ( Vicodin ) , morphine , Dilaudid exclude . 3 . Comorbid medical disorder presence active unstable uncontrolled comorbid medical condition diabetes , cardiovascular disease , cancer exclusionary criterion . In particular , individual comorbid inflammatory disorder Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis autoimmune disorder exclude . Any uncontrolled medical condition deem investigator interfere propose study procedure , put study participant undue risk also consider exclusionary criterion . 4 . Chronic infection individual chronic infection also exclude effect immune marker measure study . 5 . Comorbid pain disorder individual comorbid pain disorder fibromyalgia also exclude . Individuals fibromyalgia find sleep abnormality well daytime fatigue pain ( Drewes 1999 ) thus could confound finding . 6 . Psychiatric disorder current condition major depressive disorder , bipolar disorder risk suicide also consider exclusionary criterion . 7 . Genderbased criterion pregnant breastfeed woman also exclude effect neuroendocrine system sleep</criteria>
