	<brief_summary>Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) common disorder affect 13 % US population . CRS affect numerous Quality Life ( QOL ) factor include smell , sleep communication . The common treatment medically noncompliant CRS Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery ( FESS ) . As disease course generally idle , prolonged medical treatment guideline antibiotic treatment , prescribe accordingly follow appropriately obtain nasal culture , lasting week without additional topical oral steroid treatment . While FESS success rate general notion , failure rate primary FESS high 2-24 % 2 , Cochrane review even suggest FESS though safe procedure benefit medical management . With mind address fail FESS , new bacteria emerge . The new bacteria CRS Coagulase-negative staphylococci common isolates ( 36 % ) , follow Staphylococcus aureus ( 25 % ) , Streptococcus viridans ( 8.3 % ) , Corynebacterium ( 4.6 % ) , anaerobes ( 6.4 % ) . Patients relieve primary FESS demonstrate significant rise Pseudomonas MRSA bacteria positive culture . Moreover surgical success patient Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa positive culture usually reduce . Bacterial killing , usage light-activated agent Indocyanine Green ( ICG ) exposure specific wavelength , eventually produce bacterial killing . Mechanisms primarily involve production reactive oxygen specie ( i.e . singlet oxygen free radical ) kill bacteria . ICG bacterial kill effect . Low level laser therapy ( LLLT ) show effective bactericidal single multiple wave exposure . The study purpose treat CRS alternative antibiotic , thus spar volunteer prolong antibiotic use possible side effect , mention cost growth resistant bacteria . We believe combine ICG light even light alone produce beneficial effect . Although show kill bacteria lab animal study still investigational human . The study two arm : ICG + laser laser arm . ICG apply locally nasal passage ( internally ) follow laser activation power set 6W . The laser activate diffuse mode meaning light specific know wavelength deliver evenly nasal cavity beam . Laser treatment plan without ICG . Volunteers assign one group randomly mean 50 % chance enrol treatment group . Volunteers know group . Weekly visit total three visit follow . With visit Volunteers receive additional treatment initial treatment nasal culture take . Volunteers fill questionnaire visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laser Assisted Treatment Chronic Sinusitis With Without Light Activated Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective randomize trial perform period 1 year 20 patient arm meeting inclusion criterion recruit . One arm treat NIR laser ( ARC Lasers Gmbh , Germany ) alone another arm ICG+ NIR laser treatment . FDA approve NIR laser range 810- 980nm . FDA approve ICG ( Akorn , Buffalo Grove , IL ) apply locally total application exceed 2.5 mg Randomization method : first five volunteer start ICG+ laser follow five laser treatment group . This follow allocate one volunteer study arm alternatively . Data collect : demographical data include age gender , approximate duration symptom , culture result , SNOT 20 ( QOL questionnaire ) score . Urine test do rule pregnancy prior study enrollment . Treatment : ICG arm- define local application pledget soak ICG concentration 200µg , upon removal pledget NIR diode laser set 6W light emittance introduce intranasally 30mm diffuser fiber capable radiate light circumferentially allow light energy reach treatable area . Laser activate 180 second . Assuming approximate radius nasal cavity 3mm , energy density around 200J/cm² . Treatment repeat twice , 5-7 day apart . Cultures collect end treatment . Non-ICG arm : without ICG appliance . Follow consist office visit upon end treatment additional visit schedule two week later Protective equipment : specifically design eye goggles , drape prevent clothes stain dye</detailed_description>
