	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) breast cancer translate well surgical outcome . MRIs may help ensure little healthy tissue remove possible may help prevent need additional surgical procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Importance Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Treating Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose role preoperative staging-MRI breast cancer study follow occurrence negative margin first surgery volume resection randomize prospective study . The need re-excision objective marker satisfactory local surgery available soon final pathology report back . We propose close margin rate re-excision use primary outcome measure evaluate contribution MRI . In addition , since cosmetic preservation one goal breast conservation , propose cosmetic outcome use secondary outcome measure . The visual analogue scale cosmetic outcome varies observer time ; however , volume tissue excise objective surrogate cosmetic outcome.15 Since excise volume dictate tumor volume , variable surgeon 's control volume benign tissue excise order obtain negative margin . Hence , study , propose use volume index excise margin outcome measure cosmesis . The index value calculate subject add two measurement benign margin three dimension measure multiply produce volume index subject .</detailed_description>
