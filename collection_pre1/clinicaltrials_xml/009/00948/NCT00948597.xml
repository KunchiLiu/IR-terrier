	<brief_summary>The U.S. National Health Nutrition Examination Survey 1994 indicate 59 % American men 49 % woman body mass index ( BMIs ) 25 . Extreme obesity , define BMI 40 , find 2 % men 4 % woman [ http : //www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm ] . The new survey 2007 indicate alarm increase BMI ; 63 % Americans overweight , 26 % obese category . With extreme obesity high 26-30 % adult , obesity percentage child also sharply rise . These alarm number pose major clinical problem term safe effective use drug child . Obesity may alter disposition and/or clearance drug body well response , consider use anesthetic patient . Total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) propofol widely use child , adolescent adult undergo surgery , rapid onset action , ease titration rapid offset action . While extensive research optimal propofol dose perform non-obese adult , include critically ill mechanically ventilated adult patient investigator ' collaborator , evidence require dosage morbidly obese adult pediatric patient highly lipophilic agent . As consequence , serious problem arise due under- overdosing , increase risk inadequate effect adverse event , respectively . Crucial additional information need pharmacokinetics drug use morbidly obese child improve safety efficacy . This proposal test novel approach identify pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ( PK/PD ) factor associate response therapy adverse event . If successful , study provide proof concept data PK/PD model-based dosing strategy implement daily clinical care allow tailor dose individual need . Propofol versatile anesthetic agent dose individual need base patient 's characteristic specific PK/PD parameter , allow individualized dosing , thereby greatly reduce related toxicity . The prospective identification predictive factor morbidly obese high-risk patient represent new approach increasingly common clinical problem . The investigator expect study generate PK/PD data necessary continue well power prospective clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES Hypothesis : The inter-patient variability propofol effect relation clinical response adverse event morbidly obese adolescent associate identifiable pharmacokinetic factor . Specific Aim 1 : Determine extent body weight affect propofol pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) morbidly obese adolescent . Specific Aim 2 : Develop PK/PD model-based dosing algorithm individualize propofol dose morbidly obese adolescent . To address hypothesis , conduct clinical study evaluate pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics propofol 20 morbidly obese subject schedule undergo laparoscopic gastric band another elective procedure . Full PK/PD profile obtain surgery Bispectral index monitor use validated approach PD monitoring , measure depth anesthesia ( 5 ) . The population nonlinear mixed effect modeling ( NONMEM ) approach use extensive covariate analysis account observe inter- intraindividual variability ( 6 , 7 ) . The potential covariates affect propofol PK ( PD ) explore include total body weight , lean body mass , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , Body Surface Area ( BSA ) , height , age , gender , type procedure , duration procedure . In addition , exploratory fashion , evaluate propofol pharmacogenetics . CYP2B6 UGT1A9 highly polymorphic enzyme responsible metabolism propofol ( 20 , 21 ) . Novel allelic form CYP2B6 ( 22 ) UGT1A9 ( 23 ) identify recently potentially could explain large patient variability clearance result large difference propofol blood concentration responses standard dos . STUDY DESIGN Description Study Design The study clinical non-intervention study interfere standard anesthetic perioperative care except BIS monitor additional blood sample indwell line follow anesthesia . One blood sample genetic testing ( 3 ml ) 1.0 ml baseline PK/PD model drawn venous line place clinical standard care . The remain 1.0 ml serial blood sample pharmacokinetic model drawn indwell venous line place anesthesia . The rate propofol give standardized minimize variability anesthesiologist . Induction anesthesia do infusion 1000mcg/kg/min propofol . This bolus follow propofol infusion rate 250-350 mcg/kg/min 10 min , titrate clinical need anesthesia team . Propofol Concentration Measurements : Blood sample ( 1.0 ml ) collect indwell line oxalate tube . Samples collect scheduled time point . The number sample subject may vary depend amount time subject surgery . Samples may also draw unscheduled time point propofol dose adjustment make surgical procedure . The total sample volume propofol concentration measurement exceed 22ml . Samples collect follow schedule unscheduled time-points . Times sample collection approximation . Ideally , sample begin 15 minute collection obtain within +/- 5 minute times list , possible : Scheduled time point : Baseline : • within 15 minute prior induction propofol After induction propofol : - 1-3 min - 5 min - 10 min - 15 min - 30 min - 45 min - 60 min - 120 min - 180 min - 240 min - Within 5 min prior stop propofol infusion After end propofol infusion - 5 min - 10 min - 15 min - 30 min - 45 min - 120 min Unscheduled time point : - Within 5 min prior dose adjustment - 60 min dose adjustment NOTE : If schedule sample collection fall within 10 minute unscheduled sample collection , unscheduled sample collect . Whole blood sample store 4°C analysis ( within 1 month ) . BIS Monitoring : An age head size-appropriate disposable BIS sensor ( standard pediatric XP sensor , Aspect Medical Systems , Norwood , MA ) place child 's forehead connect BIS monitor direct manufacturer describe recently u ( 5 ) . The sensor single-use latex/PVC free . Each sensor contain strip electrode . This one-piece unit coat medical grade adhesive establish electrical contact place forehead , design symmetrical placement capture bi-hemispheric data . The sensor attach via cable VISTA stand alone unit module serf interface sensor BIS monitor . This module signal converter , acquire electroencephalogram ( EEG ) signal sensor convert EEG signal digital format . The EEG signal process BIS index play monitor . Data output ( processed raw EEG ) download . The BIS monitor screen cover procedure ensure anesthesia personnel involve care blind BIS score trend screen avoid BIS score influence change propofol dos . At end procedure , BIS data electronically transfer computer along time point study parameter ( 18 ) . Data collect case report form include follow : date time BIS data collection , include start end time ; minimum , average maximum BIS value various time point include propofol bolus dos , rate change discontinuation ; average Signal Quality Index ( SQI ) ; average electromyography ( EMG ) . Demographic Clinical Data : We use analyze patient demographic clinical data combination PK/PD data ( 10 , 11 ) Pharmacokinetic /Pharmacodynamic modeling purpose . Patient data collect include : age , gender , ethnicity , weight , height body mass index . Clinical data collect recorded case report form include : blood pressure , heart rate , temperature end tidal carbon dioxide level ( ETCO2 ) . Other clinical data record case report form include : time need lose consciousness ( loss verbal contact ) , start/stop time propofol dosing , propofol infusion rate , propofol dose adjustment , time eye open verbal command post infusion , sedation score ( Ramsey sedation scale ) post-operatively every 10 minute ( +/- 2 minute ) first 30 minute thereafter every 30 minute ( +/- 5 minute ) Post Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) . Pharmacogenetics : Participation involve collection one blood sample ( 3.0 ml ) EDTA ( lavender top ) tube pharmacogenetic testing . Genomic DNA extract use standard procedure . Questionnaire ( ) : The Structured Awareness Screening Interview shall use detect awareness anesthetic period adverse event relate underdosing/reduced sensitivity propofol effect ( 24 ) . This questionnaire use detect awareness perioperative behavioral study child age 5 older ( 25 ) . The question use child . No incentive give child answer , lead question ask screen interview . For study , questionnaire administer two time , post-operative day ( POD ) 1 3 . The POD1 questionnaire administer study anesthesiologist . If subject answer `` '' question six , anesthesiologist may decide continue interview . For subject discharge prior POD 3 , parent legal representative give write set question leave hospital request ask child question POD 3 , write child 's response , mail question back . To justify repeated questioning , parent tell child 's memory anesthetic might change time . They shall instruct ask question exactly write write child 's reply verbatim . If child answer POD3 question directly instead ask question parent , response evaluate inclusion Principal Investigator . Subjects consent adult may answer question directly . If subject still hospital POD 3 , study anesthesiologist administer questionnaire .</detailed_description>
