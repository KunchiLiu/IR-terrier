If patient able provide write informed consent , write informed consent must obtain legally authorize representative patient 's behalf . Continue reside someone community regular contact primary caregiver ; patient reside assist living facility eligible participate . Continue primary caregiver willing accept responsibility supervise treatment ( eg , application removal patch daily approximately time day ) , assess condition patient throughout extension study . Must medically stable tolerate current dose rivastigmine patch determine investigator . Refer core study protocol full detail exclusion criterion . Patients discontinue core study due reason exclude . No additional exclusion may apply investigator , order ensure study population representative eligible patient .
