	<brief_summary>Young African child live high transmission area suffer great burden malaria . In African country , Uganda , current preventive measure malaria high transmission setting use insecticide treat bednets ( ITNs ) . Preliminary data show even set ITN use , young child live high transmission set suffer almost 4 episode clinical malaria per year , highlight need new preventive strategy . Chemopreventive strategy offer potential mean reduce burden malaria among young child live high transmission set . This study compare efficacy safety 3 promising chemopreventive strategy ( monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine , monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine , daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ) current standard chemoprevention conduct two distinct patient population : 1 ) HIV-unexposed child ( HIV-uninfected child bear HIV-uninfected mother ) 2 ) HIV-exposed child ( HIV-uninfected child bear HIV-infected mother ) . The intervention begin HIV-unexposed child reach 6 month age , time incidence malaria begin increase , continue child reach 24 month age , prior data suggest incidence malaria begin decline due development semi-immunity . In addition , study participant follow one additional year follow chemopreventive therapy examine `` rebound '' incidence malaria follow intervention . HIV-exposed child begin intervention complete breastfeeding confirm remain HIV-uninfected . The intervention continue study participant reach 24 month age study participant follow additional year examine rebound incidence malaria . It anticipate result study provide valuable comparative data effect different chemopreventive strategy malaria incidence two distinct patient population high risk malaria . In addition anticipate result study provide insight development naturally acquire antimalarial immunity set chemopreventive therapy differ term drug regimen , age intervention start , HIV status mother .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Convenience sample use enroll cohort 600 HIV-uninfected infant age 4-5 month age accord follow stratum base mother 's HIV status : 1 ) 200 HIV-exposed infant bear HIV-infected mother , 2 ) 400 HIV-unexposed infant bear HIV-uninfected mother . Potential study participant identify Tororo District Hospital Antenatal Clinic surround clinic provide routine pediatric care . Potential study participant less 6 month age parents/guardians refer study clinic screening . Eligible child enrol reach 4-5 month age follow age 36 month routine medical care designate study clinic . All mother-child pair receive 2 long last ITNs enrollment , available , basic care package include safe water vessel , multivitamins condom . HIV-unexposed child randomize one four chemoprevention arm reach 6 month age . All HIV-exposed child bear HIV-infected mother give TS prophylaxis mother encourage introduce food 6 month life continue breastfeed 1 year life , accordance Ugandan Ministry Health ( MOH ) guideline . HIV-exposed child retested HIV approximately every 60 day breastfeed 6 week follow cessation breastfeed . HIV-exposed child remain HIV-uninfected following cessation breastfeed randomize one four chemoprevention arm . HIV-exposed child test positive HIV course study ( seroconvert breastfeeding ) exclude study refer appropriate care . During follow-up period , patient present clinic new episode fever undergo standard evaluation ( history , physical examination Giemsa-stained blood smear ) diagnosis malaria . Children diagnose uncomplicated malaria treat AL child diagnose complicate malaria treat quinine accordance national guideline . Response antimalarial therapy assess use standardize guideline . All AL treatment failure occur within 14 day diagnosis treat quinine accordance national guideline . In event patient fail quinine therapy , therapy repeat quinine plus clindamycin . Patients complicate malaria contraindication give quinine treat parenteral artesunate . All episode diagnose 14 day previous episode consider new episode treatment purpose . After two year age , patient uncomplicated malaria follow visit day Antimalarial drug administer ( Day 0 , 1 , 2 ) . Routine assessment perform study clinic approximately every 30 day . Routine assessment include review study protocol parents/guardians study participant , assessment outside medical care , assessment adherence assign chemopreventive therapy , focus history physical examination routine blood smear detection asymptomatic parasitemia . Routine phlebotomy perform approximately every 120 day study participant CBC , glucose ALT measurement .</detailed_description>
