	<brief_summary>This study conduct determine percentage patient solid spinal fusion treat Osteocel Plus ALIF procedure . Due unique processing condition , Osteocel Plus retain high concentration stem cell conjunction allograft bone matrix , hypothesize fusion rate Osteocel Plus comparable publish data autograft . The Osteocel product family already use approximately 15,000 case worldwide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OsteocelÂ® Plus Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion ( ALIF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , non-randomized multi-center study compare use Osteocel Plus subject receive ALIF surgery one two level . These subject present degenerative condition lumbar spine amenable surgical treatment screen prior study enrollment . Subjects receive Osteocel Plus ALIF operation . Subjects follow 24-months following surgery determine number study subject solidly fuse 24 month postoperatively , determine mean time fusion . This data compare publish and/or retrospective data autograft , synthetic ceramic BMP .</detailed_description>
