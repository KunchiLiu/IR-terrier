	<brief_summary>Mentor undertake five-year prospective clinical study design collect safety data associate implantation gel-filled mammary prosthesis . This study `` adjunct '' study , encompass clinical review reconstructive case patient meet clinical regulatory criterion breast reconstruction gel-filled mammary prosthesis . This `` adjunct '' study accomplish limited clinical protocol specific parameter require control somewhat less stringent normally require Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE ) Trials .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mentor Adjunct Study Silicone Gel-Filled Mammary Prosthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives study gather safety data regard short term , post-implant event complication need support Premarket Approval ( PMA ) submission Mentor Silicone Gel-Filled Mammary Prostheses maintain comprehensive record patient 's ongoing medical history . The FDA place device regulatory category Class III device , pursuant Medical Device Amendments Federal Food Drug Act go effect May 1976 . For device class , FDA require certain clinical data regard risk associate mammary prosthesis . Due several issue surround possible risk silicone gel-filled breast implant , FDA mandate specific clinical study requirement ass possible risk complication silicone device . Clinical data collect via study supplement data collect extensive `` Core '' study breast reconstruction augmentation procedure . Primary Objective - Safety Assessment Specifically , data collect study provide risk complication data regard short-term use silicone breast implant . This safety assessment include , limited : - Incidence capsular contracture - Occurrence complication infection seroma - Rupture rate implant Secondary Objectives This study intend ass rare , long-term speculative condition prove clinically associate mammary prosthesis , relationship Connective Tissue Disorders , increase risk cancer teratogenic effect among breast implant patient . This study also intend address issue regard effect breast implant mammography interpretation occurrence calcium deposit tissue surround implant . However , data complication note study , occur , record analyze regard objective study .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Must female ( genotypical female ) , 2 . The patient must willing follow study requirement include : 1 . Sign Informed Consent Document surgery performed . ( If patient age consent , parent guardian must sign . It responsibility doctor determine state 's age majority . ) 2 . Agree complete require followup visit . 3 . For patient wish participate Patient Registry : agree condition Implant Registry follow requirement Registry program . 4 . Agree follow Mentor Standard Operating Procedures explant analysis case patient may ask authorize sponsor complete analysis study device ( ) may require removal throughout duration study . 5 . Must determine Investigator medical specialist ( require ) acceptable candidate reconstructive breast surgery . General medical condition history , well psychological appropriateness consider surgical intervention , AND 3 . In medical opinion surgeon condition must saline implant deem unsuitable patient . ( Patient preference gel implant NOT consider medical condition . ) Examples saline unsuitability : 1 . Severe wrinkle exist saline implant extent would consider severe deformity ( implant must place long 6 month ) 2 . Unilateral replacement ( opposite breast gel ) 3 . Tissue skin thin support saline implant 4 . Previously dissect pocket incompatible saline implant , AND 4 . The patient must one follow breast condition : 1 . Postunilateral bilateral mastectomy ( immediate delay ) result cancer disease process . 2 . Require reconstruction due cancer treatment mastectomy . 3 . Require revision due complication undesirable result previous surgery reason . 4 . PostTrauma define total partial removal breast ( ) surgery ( reason ) result trauma . 5 . Congenital deformity define : Pectus Excavatum define congenital concave chest wall deformity abnormality sternum anterior rib . Pectus Carinatum define convex chest wall deformity abnormality sternum anterior rib . Severe asymmetry define congenital acquire substantial discrepancy breast sizes represent significant physical deformity abnormality ( e.g. , Poland 's syndrome ) . 6 . Severe ptosis define require reconstruction procedure mastopexy ( tissue and/or skin must remove breast qualify mastopexy procedure ) . 7 . Patients require revision implant replacement severe deformity cause medical surgical complication , regardless original indication implantation type device originally implant . 8 . Replacement revision patient whose prior surgery result treatment cancer saline implant unsuitable ( e.g. , skin thin , insufficient tissue , etc . ) deem surgeon . 9 . Size change ( large small ) allow Investigator determines revision replacement require medical reason . In case change size indication surgery , medical necessity exists , protocol allow replacement . 10 . Patients require Augmentation mammaplasty unaffected breast result surgery , due one indication , affect breast ( i.e. , unilateral mastectomy augmentation opposite breast provide symmetry ) . 11 . Special circumstance implantation consider case case basis per write FDA authorization . In addition general condition , opinion surgeon and/or consult physician may exclude patient enrollment study subject , patient must exclude meet one follow condition . 1 . Augmentation mammaplasty failure least one diagnose identify inclusion criterion . 2 . Have abscess infection anywhere body time study entry . 3 . Be currently pregnant nursing . 4 . Be diagnose lupus define Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Discoid Lupus , scleroderma define Progressive Systemic Sclerosis . 5 . Currently uncontrolled diabetes disease clinically know impact wound heal ability . 6 . Demonstrate tissue characteristic clinically incompatible mammaplasty ( e.g. , tissue damage result radiation , inadequate tissue , compromise vascularity ulceration ) . 7 . Possess condition currently treatment condition , opinion Investigator and/or consult physician ( ) , may constitute unwarranted surgical risk . 8 . Demonstrate psychological characteristic inappropriate attitude motivation , , opinion Investigator incompatible risk , involved surgical procedure prosthesis . 9 . Unwillingness undergo surgery revision ( require ) .</criteria>
