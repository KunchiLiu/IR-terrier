	<brief_summary>This prospective , non-randomized multi-center study compare use Osteocel速 Plus subject receive XLIF速 ( eXtreme Lateral Interbody Fusion ) surgery one two level . These subject present degenerative condition lumbar spine amenable surgical treatment screen prior study enrollment . Subjects receive Osteocel Plus XLIF operation . Subjects follow 24-months following surgery determine number study subject solidly fuse 24 month postoperatively , determine mean time fusion . This data compare publish and/or retrospective data autograft , synthetic ceramic Bone Morphogenetic Protein ( BMP ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Osteocel速 Plus eXtreme Lateral Interbody Fusion ( XLIF速 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteocel Plus allograft cellular bone matrix contain native mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) intend mimic biologic performance autograft without morbidity associate autograft harvest . Mesenchymal stem cell , like find Osteocel Plus , naturally occur body differentiate variety tissue type , depend local environment . Once implanted , MSCs differentiate osteoblast , produce new bone matrix . MSCs also naturally secrete bone-inducing growth factor signal patient 's endogenous cell migrate participate bone formation process . Osteocel Plus different orthobiologic product DBM allograft cancellous bone contain live stem cell , provide osteogenic potential . The cell include mesenchymal stem cell adult human donor ; embryonic source . This study conduct determine percentage patient solid spinal fusion treat Osteocel XLIF procedure . Due unique processing condition , Osteocel Plus retain high concentration stem cell conjunction allograft bone matrix , hypothesize fusion rate Osteocel Plus comparable publish data autograft . The Osteocel product family already use approximately 15,000 case worldwide .</detailed_description>
