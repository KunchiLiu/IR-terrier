	<detailed_description>The overall goal project : 1. investigate determinant evaluate potential intervention reduce spread methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) infection community setting order reduce burden illness State Pennsylvania . This objective follow specific aim : - identify host , microbiological environmental risk factor prolong MRSA colonization , MRSA transmission clinical MRSA infection among patient MRSA skin soft tissue infection ( SSTIs ) household contact use stochastic agent-based modeling method quantify secondary spread CO-MRSA household . - evaluate impact decolonization intervention MRSA infection household . - identify immunological mechanism underlie ability Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization inhibit MRSA colonization , transmission infection order identify potential future immunological target intervention . 2. foster multi-disciplinary cross-institutional collaboration develop infrastructure Center Excellence focus antimicrobial drug resistance research , capacity activity link basic science , epidemiological clinical intervention study 3. enhance opportunity basic clinical research training undergraduate graduate student , particularly underrepresented minority , order increase pipeline future biomedical scientist clinical investigator</detailed_description>
