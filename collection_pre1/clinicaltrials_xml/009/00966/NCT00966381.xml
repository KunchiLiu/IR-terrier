	<brief_summary>Approximately 8 million American woman suffer osteoporosis , one every two woman age 50 osteoporotic-related fracture lifetime ( 42 ) . While epidemiological study suggest pregnancy lactation associate risk fracture later life , study control site-specific decrement bone mineral density ( BMD ) . In addition , 55 % American woman age 20 39 overweight ( 14 ) . Excess weight retention pregnancy increase woman 's risk develop chronic disease later life ( 44 ) . There paucity research exercise dietary intervention postpartum lactate woman aim promotion bone health weight loss . The goal study promote long-term lifestyle change home base strength training , aerobic , nutrition intervention target overweight lactate woman . The objective attenuate lactation-induced bone loss promote weight loss . We hypothesize intervention group lose great amount fat mass preserve lean mass bone mineral mass increase level anabolic hormone diet exercise compare minimal care group . Additionally , acquisition knowledge unique since study measure growth hormone insulin-like growth factor-1 lactating woman respect bone exercise . This intervention encourage breastfeeding , weight loss increase bone density result healthy infant mother . The propose research first examine effect resistance exercise weight loss intervention attenuation lactation-induced bone loss overweight woman . To knowledge , first study use MyPyramid Menu Planner Moms dietary counseling use total diet approach . The expected outcome intervention group lose weight preserve lean body mass , bone mineral mass increase cardiovascular fitness strength compare minimal care group . Additionally , exercise group improve overall quality diet use internet base technology . An increase activity promotion weight loss modest reduction calorie may lead overall improvement mother 's bone health status later life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants randomize , stratified parity , either intervention minimal care group baseline measurement complete ( 3 +/- 1 wk postpartum ) . The specific aim project evaluate overweight lactate woman 3 20 week postpartum ( PP ) whether exercise weight loss intervention , compare minimal care group , : 1 . Improve body composition . The work hypothesis aim intervention group lose less lean body mass bone mineral mass promote fat loss compare minimal care group 20 week PP . 2 . Promote increase cardiovascular fitness strength . The work hypothesis aim intervention group increase predict maximal oxygen consumption maximal strength compare minimal care group 20 week PP . 3 . Affect bone-related hormone . The work hypothesis aim intervention group increase growth hormone insulin-like growth factor-1 compare minimal care group 20 week PP . 4 . Improve total diet overall pattern food eaten . The work hypothesis aim , base menu model MyPyramid ( 16 ) , intervention group improve quality intake consume recommend amount food group establish MyPyramid compare minimal care group 20 week PP .</detailed_description>
