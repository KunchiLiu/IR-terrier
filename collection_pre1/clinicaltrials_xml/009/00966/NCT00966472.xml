	<brief_title>Phase I Study Statin + Erlotinib Advanced Solid Malignancies With Focus Squamous Cell Carcinomas NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytotoxic chemotherapy remain mainstay anti-cancer medical treatment vast majority patient locally advance metastatic squamous cell cancer . However , curative success remain low patient eventually succumb disease complication . Moreover , cytotoxic chemotherapy frequently associate severe unwanted side effect . Therefore , patient population unmet therapeutic need high new treatment require . Statins drug inhibit cellular mevalonate pathway conventionally use treatment hypercholesterolemia cardiovascular disorder . Increasing evidence suggest statin might use cancer prevention/treatment interaction essential cellular function , cell proliferation differentiation . Recent vitro data indicate statin induce growth arrest apoptosis , inhibit secretion proteolytic enzyme , reduce invasiveness inhibit angiogenesis . These effect contribute reduction tumor growth metastases preclinical vivo model variety tumor suggest statin may useful anticancer therapy . Studies previously perform group demonstrate target mevalonate pathway induce tumor specific cytotoxicity number tumor type include squamous cell carcinoma , myeloid leukemia variety pediatric cancer . Additionally , several clinical trial also assess antitumor activity statin . Pre-clinically , demonstrate additive cytotoxic effect combine lovastatin tyrosine kinase inhibitor Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) HNSCC cell ( AG1478 ) 8 squamous cell carcinoma ( gefitinib ) . Mechanistically , lovastatin treatment inhibit EGF induce EGFR autophosphorylation 24hrs show co-operative target EGFR combination gefitinib . Taken together , result demonstrate target mevalonate pathway inhibit EGFR function suggest potential utility combining class drug ( i.e . EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor statin ) . The use lovastatin optimal due greatly enhanced toxicity drug gefitinib erlotinib simultaneously metabolize enzyme ( cytP450A4 ) . In contrast , rosuvastatin relatively novel potent mevalonate pathway inhibitor metabolize significantly cytP450A4 . Due enhance clinical activity erlotinib comparison EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor , combination erlotinib rosuvastatin appear ideal .</detailed_description>
