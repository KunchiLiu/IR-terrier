	<brief_title>How Fast Are ? Speed General Versus Spinal Anesthesia Emergency Cesarean Delivery : A Simulation Based Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rapid delivery fetus emergency cesarean delivery usually necessary risk mother fetus ( 1 ) . Some maternal indication emergency cesarean delivery include uncontrolled bleeding , high spinal block cardiac arrest . For fetus , minute may count abnormal fetal heart rate pattern accompany uterine rupture umbilical cord prolapse . Under emergency circumstance publish recommendation include delivery occur within 30 minute decision time ( 2 ) . Thus , time take achieve surgical anesthesia important keep short possible minimize risk fetus ( 3 ) . In absence pre-existing labor epidural rapidly extend anesthesia , general ( GA ) spinal ( SA ) anesthesia usually administer facilitate delivery urgent/emergent situation . Each technique risk benefit , choice anesthesia ultimately depend upon circumstance . For example , severe maternal bleeding would favor GA perceived quicker ( although study confirm ) uncontrolled hemorrhage produce hemodynamic instability exacerbate SA . On hand , know reaction anesthetic agent ( malignant hyperthermia ) would make SA favorable . There perception amongst anesthesiologists GA pregnant woman associate increased morbidity mortality . This partly due increase use regional anesthesia since 1960s uncommon occurrence general anesthesia lead increase incidence complication worldwide ( 4 , 5 ) . The reason relate physiological change pregnancy make endotracheal intubation difficult , increase risk pulmonary aspiration stomach content awareness intraoperative event ( 6 , 7 ) . These potential risk mean few general anesthetic cesarean delivery do number central neuraxial block ( spinal , epidural ) increase . This mean anesthesiologists less experienced general anesthesia obstetrics ( 8 , 9 ) . As well , delivery infant likely initially depress require active resuscitation deliver SA ( 10 ) . The depression due GA also reason rapid delivery , example cord prolapse cause fetal distress . Apart avoid risk GA , SA add advantage parturient awake infant bear accompanied partner OR . As morphine give spinal medication woman generally less pain post-operatively well clear mind . However , occasionally SA fail necessitate GA . It unknown technique quicker . Some anesthesiologist believe SA administer quickly GA often persist administer SA fear risk general anesthesia . However , induction general anesthesia endotracheal intubation , surgery start immediately SA surgical anesthesia take time develop anesthetic drug inject . There study examine surgery actually start follow SA GA . Direct comparison two technique emergency situation base randomize control trial impossible due problem obtain consent emergency situation minute count . Marx et al find spinal anesthesia induce quickly GA , spinal needle use big drug use ( amethocaine ) commonly use modern practice ( 11 ) . Simulation emergency scenario allow anesthesiologist practice safe emergency anesthesia ( 12 ) . In pilot simulation study insertion SA find quick GA , time achieve surgical anesthesia longer ( 13 ) . Thus , overall time induce anesthesia time surgery could actually start long SA . We wish undertake simulation base study compare speed GA versus SA emergency cesarean delivery . We also wish observe technique anesthesiologist use expedite readiness surgical anesthesia . At conclusion study , hope help anesthesiologist decide upon optimum technique anesthesia emergency cesarean delivery affect fetal maternal outcome .</detailed_description>
