	<brief_summary>Background : Whether management vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) therapy general practitioner collaboration anticoagulation clinic ( ACC ) provide well clinical outcome accomplish general practitioner alone ( usual care [ UC ] management ) clear . Objectives : To compare ACC-based shared-care management UC management VKA therapy respect clinical event . Patients/Methods : Open , randomize , multicenter study patient start VKA therapy least three month . The primary study outcome composite confirm symptomatic thromboembolic major bleed event . All-cause mortality secondary outcome . All outcomes review central , independent adjudication committee .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design The COMPARE ( Comparison Oral anticoagulation Monitoring Practice : A Randomized Evaluation ) study open , centrally randomize , multicenter , prospective , control study compare two model vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) therapy management . Written inform consent obtain patient general practitioner randomization . Setting participant The study concern patient referred anticoagulation clinic ( ACC ) various University Hospitals France . Eligible patient consecutive patient start course VKA therapy schedule last least three month . Randomization intervention All eligible patient evaluate physician specialized vascular medicine hematology . After demographic characteristic medical history record , randomize one model VKA therapy management , either UC management ACC-based shared-care management . Randomization stratify center ; list randomization computer-generated accord permuted block design block size four , six eight . General practitioner inform outcome randomization standardize letter . In patient randomize UC management group , monitor VKA therapy leave general practitioner 's discretion accord his/her preference habit . Patients randomize ACC-based shared-care management group receive standardize educational package ; moreover , biological laboratory measure INR value patient group contact explain importance rapid restitution result . A computer-generated dose proposal also give , telephone fax , general practitioner follow patient randomize ACC-based shared-care management group ; however , free accept ignore proposal . All patient receive logbook record INR result . Study outcomes The primary study outcome composite symptomatic objectively confirm thromboembolic major bleed event 18 month . Thromboembolic event acute myocardial infarction , stroke , peripheral arterial occlusion , deep-vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism . Major bleed event fatal bleeding , bleed lead functional impairment require hospitalization . All-cause mortality secondary outcome measure . All outcomes review central , independent adjudication committee , member unaware patient ' study group . The quality anticoagulation control evaluate randomized patient least two INR measurement . This parameter assess determine ( 1 ) percentage INR within target range , ( 2 ) percentage time INR within target range relation total length observation period , accord linear interpolation method , ( 3 ) variability index ( Ïƒ2 ) . Statistical analysis This superiority study hypothesize ACC-based shared-care management would reduce cumulative incidence primary study outcome 50 % compare UC management . On basis previous non-controlled study , assume cumulative incidence primary study outcome would 10 % patient assign UC management group . Given assumption , calculate recruitment 600 patient per group would allow confirmation statistical hypothesis 90 % power two-sided , type I error 0.05 . The statistical analysis perform randomized patient intention-to-treat basis .</detailed_description>
