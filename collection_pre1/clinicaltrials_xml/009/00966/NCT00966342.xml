Standardized manufacturing process favour consistent vaccine safety immunogenicity profile year year unanticipated difference occur . As consequence unusual occurrence `` oculorespiratory syndrome '' recipient Canadian-made TIV 2000-2001 , Canadian regulatory agency require pre-approval clinical test seasonal vaccine adult . This small scale testing ( 120 subject ) exclude occurrence infrequent , troublesome adverse effect . Expanded test desirable would best do soon vaccine approve distribution result could inform public vaccination program follow . Having establish capacity rapid evaluation new influenza vaccine invaluable event pandemic , vaccine less thoroughly test make available protect public . The objective study two-fold : 1 . To assess safety immunogenicity seasonal TIV influenza vaccine quickly enough inform subsequent public delivery program . 2 . To use opportunity refine preparedness rapid evaluation pandemic influenza vaccine .</detailed_description>
