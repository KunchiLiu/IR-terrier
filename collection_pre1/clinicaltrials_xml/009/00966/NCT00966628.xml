	<brief_summary>Dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DHF ) dengue shock syndrome ( DSS ) among lead cause pediatric hospitalization Asia.Mortality rate range 1 % centre experience fluid resuscitation , upto 44 % establish shock.The mainstay DSS treatment prompt , vigorous fluid resuscitation isotonic crystalloid solution , follow plasma colloid solution profound continue shock . However , administration often associate fluid overload induces edema patient . Hence , plan parallel , randomize control trial compare efficacy safety solution contain half molar sodium lactate ( Totilac™ ) standard treatment ( isotonic crystalloid Ringer 's Lactate ) pediatric Dengue Shock Syndrome patient , use plasma soluble Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule ( sVCAM-1 ) level indicator . Hypertonic solution restore hemodynamic status rapidly increase cardiac performance improve tissue perfusion . This obtain much small volumes.We plan assess efficacy safety hypertonic sodium lactate resuscitation DHF/DSS patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dengue affect estimate 100 million people worldwide annually endemic part Asia Americas , increase incidence report many tropical country recently.Dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DHF ) dengue shock syndrome ( DSS ) among lead cause pediatric hospitalization Asia.Mortality rate range 1 % centre experience fluid resuscitation , upto 44 % establish shock . The mainstay DSS treatment prompt , vigorous fluid resuscitation isotonic crystalloid solution , follow plasma colloid solution profound continue shock . If appropriate volume resuscitation start early stage , DSS usually reversible . Patients receive proper treatment usually die within 12-24 hour shock ensues . However , administration often associate fluid overload induces edema patient . During hypovolemia DHF/DSS , systemic hemodynamics microcirculation impair , subsequently trigger vicious cycle progressive tissue damage finally may lead development multiple organ failure . By adequately restore intravascular volume , organ perfusion may guarantee , nutritive microcirculatory flow may improve , activation complex series damage cascade may avoided.A solution rapidly restore systemic hemodynamic improve microcirculation may beneficial DHF/DSS patient . Hypertonic solution restore hemodynamic status rapidly increase cardiac performance improve tissue perfusion indicate good urine output tissue oxygenation . This obtain much small volumes.High lactate contain hypertonic sodium lactate also function alternate energy substrate . However , effect hypertonic solution resuscitate DHF/DSS patient yet investigated.Hence , plan parallel , randomize control trial compare efficacy safety solution contain half molar sodium lactate ( Totilac™ ) standard treatment ( isotonic crystalloid Ringer 's Lactate ) resuscitate pediatric Dengue Shock Syndrome patient , use plasma soluble Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule ( sVCAM-1 ) level indicator capillary endothelial leakage , frequently occur DHF/DSS .</detailed_description>
