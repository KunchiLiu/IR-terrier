	<brief_title>Lenalidomide , Thalidomide Dexamethasone Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Lenalidomide thalidomide drug alter immune system may also interfere development blood vessel help support tumor growth . This may reduce prevent growth cancer cell . Dexamethasone corticosteroid similar natural hormone make body . Dexamethasone often give MM patient combination chemotherapy treat cancer . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 4 group 3-6 patient participant enrol Phase I portion study , 46 participant enrol Phase II . If enrolled Phase I portion , dose lenalidomide thalidomide receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level combination . Each new group receive high dose combination group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose combination lenalidomide thalidomide find . If enrol Phase II portion , receive combination lenalidomide thalidomide high dose tolerate Phase I portion . All participant receive dose level dexamethasone . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . On Days 1-21 Cycles 1-8 , take lenalidomide mouth time every day , You take glass water either full empty stomach . Do break , chew , open capsule . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day ( NOT take double regular dose make miss dose ) . On Days 1-28 Cycles 1-8 , take thalidomide mouth . You take thalidomide evening full glass ( 8 ounce ) water . On Days 1-4 , 9-12 , 17-20 Cycles 1-2 , take dexamethasone mouth meal one time day . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycles 3-8 , take dexamethasone mouth one time day . You give diary record take study drug problem illness experience . You also write diary drug take study . You bring diary visit . Maintenance Therapy Study Drug Administration : If Phase 1 2 , complete 8 cycle , stable respond disease study drug experience intolerable side effect , able continue take study drug maintenance schedule . You stay schedule long benefitting . - On Days 1-21 cycle maintenance therapy , take lenalidomide mouth . - On Days 1-28 cycle maintenance therapy , take thalidomide mouth . - If doctor feel need , may continue take dexamethasone maintenance period . The dose level lenalidomide dose take Cycle 8 . The dose level thalidomide low dose study ( may lower dose receive Cycles 1-8 ) If doctor think need , dos may also lower depend well tolerate drug . Study Visits : On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You ask question feel . On Day 1 Cycles 2-8 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - You ask list drug take felt since last visit . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine blood test . - Urine collect check status disease . This urine collect 24-hour period , provide container urine collection . - You neurologic exam . - You ECG . - You complete questionnaire symptom - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure proteins blood . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure cytokine level every even cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 ) . - If disease completely respond drug , bone marrow biopsy confirm complete response . To collect bone marrow biopsy , area hip numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . - If doctor think need , x-rays bone check status bone lesion . - If doctor think need , MRI scan bone check number bone lesion . If doctor feel need , visit may take place often . You may extra visit time study doctor feel need care . Maintenance Therapy Study Visits : Once month Maintenance Therapy , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure proteins blood . - Urine collect check status disease . This urine collect 24-hour period , provide container urine collection . - If disease completely respond drug , bone marrow biopsy confirm complete response . Length Study : You receive 8 cycle study drug . If doctor think best interest , continue receive study drug Maintenance Therapy long benefit . You take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . End-of-Study Visit : If go study reason , end-of-study visit . This usually do 30 day last dose study drug . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) urine ( 24 hour ) collect check status disease . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Urine collect check status disease . This urine collect 24-hour period , provide container urine collection . - If disease completely respond drug , bone marrow biopsy confirm complete response . This investigational study . Lenalidomide FDA approve commercially available treatment type myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Dexamethasone FDA approve commercially available use combination lenalidomide treatment patient MM receive least 1 prior therapy . Thalidomide FDA approve commercially available treatment newly diagnose myeloma . The use drug combination give patient relapse refractory MM investigational . Up 64 patient take part clinical research study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
