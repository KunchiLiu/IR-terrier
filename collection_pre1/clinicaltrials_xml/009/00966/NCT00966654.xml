	<brief_summary>This research do see give hormone call GLP-1 improve heart function reduce length stay Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit ( CSICU ) people non-emergent coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect GLP - 1 ( 7-36 Amide ) Myocardial Function Following Coronary Artery Bypass ( CABG ) Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After CABG surgery , condition know hyperglycemia high blood sugar often occur even patient never diagnose diabetes . This high blood sugar lead complication surgery infection site incision . Additionally , cardiac muscle injury either prior surgery , injured cardiac muscle use glucose ( body 's fuel energy source ) well prior injury . This reduced ability use glucose slows cardiac muscle ability repair provide normal pump force function need circulate blood throughout body . This inability repair and/or provide normal pump force function make difficult patient well increase length stay require CSICU . GLP-1 ability lower blood sugar help cell use glucose fuel energy blood sugar become low glucose lower ability decrease . In study , want see want see GLP-1 may help keep blood sugar within normal limit reduce eliminate need insulin . We also see whether help heart recover quickly .</detailed_description>
