	<brief_summary>The AIMM Young study collaboration Children 's National Medical Center ( CNMC ) colleges/universities nationwide -- currently include Howard University ( HU ) , East Carolina University ( ECU ) , University Massachusetts , Amherst ( U Mass ) . This study obtain variety baseline measure ( serum biomarkers related metabolic syndrome , anthropometrics , muscle strength , fitness test ) along genetic information healthy college-age ( 18-35 year ) young adult effort identify phenotype-genotype association may predispose individual develop metabolic syndrome , type 2 diabetes , and/or related disease obesity . We hypothesize certain genetic variation protective metabolic syndrome , others show strong correlation specific component metabolic syndrome disease . We expect study `` pre-symptomatic , '' young individual facilitate identification genetic risk locus metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes . Younger population typically less confounding variable , facilitates normalize metabolic syndrome feature environment/lifestyle . Additionally , young subject provide robust longitudinal data , recruit subsequent intervention reverse trend towards metabolic syndrome , rather difficult task reverse type 2 diabetes old population . The data collect stratified accord gender , age , ethnicity , genotype , phenotypic measure determine factor influence disease risk .</brief_summary>
