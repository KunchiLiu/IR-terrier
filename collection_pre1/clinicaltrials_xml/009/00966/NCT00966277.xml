	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn dalteparin low risk VTE occur legs lung . This tested patient pancreatic cancer go receive chemotherapy . Some patient receive dalteparin receive study drug . The safety dalteparin also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dalteparin Primary Venous Thromboembolism ( VTE ) Prophylaxis Pancreatic Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug : Dalteparin design thin blood block blood clotting . This may lower risk VTE . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . There equal chance assign either group . Group 1 receive dalteparin . Group 2 receive study drug . During study , study participant routinely check VTE ultrasound CT scan . You may also receive standard therapy prevent VTE . This may include blood-thinning drug hospital , get move around least 5 time per day , and/or wear special stocking boot-like device design put pressure foot . Genetic Research Testing : Before start therapy ( baseline ) , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn store genetic testing . Researchers want use DNA ( genetic material cell ) look marker may relate high risk develop blood clot . The sample process stored MD Anderson . Once study end , DNA test Dr. Futreal 's laboratory and/or may ship outside Illumina Sequencing Services ( San Diego , CA ) genetic research . The sample deidentified ship . Before sample send outside laboratory banking , name personal identifying information cod protect privacy . The outside researcher access code link sample identity . Study Drug Administration : If Group 1 , receive dalteparin injection skin , day 16 week . You and/or caregiver taught perform injection . Study Visits : At every study visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature breathe rate ) . - Your medical history record . About every 2 week chemotherapy start Week 16 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This test may repeat often doctor decides need . Before new cycle chemotherapy Weeks 1-16 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test check function liver kidney . At Weeks 8 16 ( +/- 7 day ) , follow procedure perform : - You ultrasound legs check blood clot . - If doctor decides need , CT scan check status cancer . Researchers also check chest CT scan look blood clot lung . Length Study Participation : You may remain study 16 week . You take study early blood clot occur experience intolerable side effect . Follow-Up Phone Calls : This study 3-year follow-up period . In Year 1 , receive follow-up phone call study staff first month Months 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 . In Years 2 3 , call every 6 month . The study staff ask overall health . In first phone call , also ask side effect may occur . This investigational study . Dalteparin commercially available FDA approve use prevent VTE may occur reason . Those reason include abdominal surgery ; surgery hip fracture , hip replacement , knee replacement ; illness cause patient unable move around . Dalteparin also commercially available FDA approve treat VTE cancer patient . However , investigational use dalteparin prevent VTE cancer patient receive chemotherapy . Up 87 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Patients must sign Informed Consent . 8 . Patient must agree transfusion blood product , indicate . 9 . Ability administer subcutaneous injection study drug patient and/or care giver . 1 . Patients evidence venous thrombosis initial low extremity screen ultrasound incidental VTE site ( e.g . PE , Abdominal/pelvic vein thrombosis , etc. ) . 2 . Patients already take prophylactic full dose anticoagulation ( eg . heparin , lowmolecular weight heparin , fondaparinux , coumadin ) . 3 . Patients currently active bleeding . 4 . The presence condition high risk bleeding , include limited active peptic ulcer , recent neurosurgery , cirrhosis esophageal varix . 5 . Patients know brain metastasis . 6 . Patients know bleeding diathesis . 7 . Patients platelet count &lt; 50,000 . 8 . Patients know hypersensitivity dalteparin . 9 . Patients regularly use medication know increase risk bleed &gt; /= 325 mg aspirin daily , daily clopidogrel , daily nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication ( eg. , ibuprofen , naproxen ) .</criteria>
