	<brief_summary>Before transplant , patient pre-transplant evaluation . This help find whether health problem prevent transplant . It also provide `` baseline '' test use later see whether organ get good bad transplant . Prior stem cell collection , patient get chemotherapy help try put him/her remission push stem cell peripheral blood ( mobilization ) . The study doctor decide chemotherapy use part study . Once mobilization complete , peripheral blood stem cell collection ( apheresis ) do clinic . The apheresis machine draw blood central line . The blood pass apheresis machine stem cell separate . The remain blood send back central line . If investigator unable collect enough peripheral blood stem cell , bone marrow harvest may necessary collect stem cell . The patient admit hospital first transplant . He/she get Thiotepa Cyclophosphamide . Then patient give back cell collect . The cell give manner blood transfusion . The patient keep hospital he/she stable blood count increase . Approximately 6 8 week Day 0 1st transplant , patient admit second transplant . At time , he/she get Busulfan Melphalan collect cell give back . The patient keep hospital he/she stable blood count increase . Frequent clinic follow-up require . This study open patient le 21 year age refractory relapse high-risk , solid tumor , exclude neuroblastoma ( cooperative group trial patient ) . Patients identify Transplant team eligibility verify member clinical research team . Patients care member Transplant team various subspecialty physician .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant ( PBSCT ) Children With High Risk Recurrent Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimal treatment refractory ( disease wo n't go away standard treatment ) relapse ( disease come back go away ) solid tumor unknown . Recent study show benefit tandem peripheral blood stem cell transplantation ( PBSCT ) . In tandem transplant , two transplant do , one . To PBSCT , stem cell ( `` mother cell '' become type cell ) first collect patient 's circulating blood . The patient undergoes high-dose chemotherapy call preparative regimen . The preparative regimen destroy tumor cell , also destroy normal blood making cell . The collected cell give back patient `` rescue '' patient devastate effect preparative regimen . By use stem cell rescue able give much high dos chemotherapy would able give without stem cell rescue . To make sure tumor cell destroy , patient study undergo two separate transplant use two different preparative regimen . The preparative regimen use best agent find work recurrent refractory solid tumor : Busulfan , Thiotepa , Cyclophosphamide Melphalan .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients diagnose high risk recurrent refractory solid tumor follow initial chemotherapy 2 . Tumor must sensitive chemotherapy ( maximum 8 cycle ) and/or radiation define great 50 % reduction size primary and/or metastatic site . 3 . Patients 35 year age . 4 . Patients life expectancy least 8 week performance status ( Karnofsky Lansky score ) least 70 % . 5 . Patients acceptable candidate peripheral blood stem cell transplantation base pretransplant evaluation . 1 . Patients exclude base sex , race . 2 . Patients central nervous system tumor eligible protocol . 3 . Patients significant functional deficit major organ would interfere successful outcome follow PBSCT . 4 . Patients treated infection must appropriate response document negative culture and/or normal radiographic examination . 5 . Patients may active CNS disease marrow involvement tumor time transplant . 6 . Patients disease progression tandem PBSC # 1 eligible tandem PBSC # 2 . 7 . Patients exclude woman childbearing potential currently pregnant ( HCG+ ) practice adequate contraception . 8 . Patients previous stem cell transplant .</criteria>
