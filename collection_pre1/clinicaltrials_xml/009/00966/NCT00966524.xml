	<brief_title>Learning Retention Tracheal Intubation Medical Students : Comparison Standard Intubation Teaching Against Video-guided Intubation Teaching .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Competency laryngoscopic tracheal intubation key skill develop train medical student . Teaching technical skill remain challenge due fact laryngeal view limit one person time . Therefore , feedback give procedure instructor student becomes limited , delayed thus less efficient . This lack efficiency could explain poor success rate tracheal intubation perform medical student initial learning phase . Over last ten year , new intubation device incorporate optic fiber commercialize . These new technology combine video system increasingly use teaching purpose . Recent literature tend show new approach could ease learn process increase medical student 's satisfaction towards teach tracheal intubation . Maintaining knowledge clinical skill also challenge especially physician exposed intubation technique regular basis . Since tracheal intubation potentially lifesaving procedure , retention competency crucial . This study design assess impact teach tracheal intubation use video-guided feedback short mid-term retention competency population pregraduate medical student ( clinical year 3 4 ) . Methods : -Initial phase : Medical student enrol study initially receive standardised training use short video explain tracheal intubation technique . Then , ask intubate mannequin short period time ( 15 minute ) . A total 18 medical student randomly assign follow group : - Group V : perform video-guided intubation six patient supervision anaesthesiologist . - Group S : perform tracheal intubation six patient supervision anaesthesiologist use standard teaching technique ( direct visualization ) . Patients schedule elective surgery general anaesthesia include neuromuscular blockade part anaesthetic management consider study . Standard monitor general anaesthesia use . Immediately induction general anaesthesia , anaesthesiologist confirm patient 's intubation grade . Patients intubation grade high 2 Cormack-Lehane scale , exclude . -Short-term phase ( within week initial phase ) : Novices ask perform ten tracheal intubation supervision anaesthesiologist without specific feedback . -Mid-term phase ( 6 week initial/short-term phase ) : Novices ask perform ten tracheal intubation six week initial/short term phase supervision anaesthesiologist without specific feedback . If medical student fail intubate patient , anaesthesiologist perform technique . Images intubation capture videotape subsequent review . These image use detect mucosa laceration , oesophageal intubation , number attempt total time require perform tracheal intubation . Lastly , questionnaire complete medical student assess satisfaction towards teach technique ability perform tracheal intubation .</detailed_description>
