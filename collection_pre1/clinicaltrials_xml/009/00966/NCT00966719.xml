	<detailed_description>1.1 Overview This study ass effectiveness breastfeed support intervention infant admit hospital jaundice . It evaluate effect intervention duration breastfeed health care utilization . 1.2 Study Objectives : Primary : To determine effect breastfeed support intervention breastfeed duration breastfeed infant admit hospital jaundice . Secondary : - To determine rate breastfeeding failure , define breastfeed cessation infant turn 6 month , mother jaundice infant randomize control group , compare rate breastfeeding failure general population . - To compare subsequent healthcare utilization group first six month life , determine number re-hospitalizations jaundice , hospitalization non-jaundice related cause , well physician encounter . - To determine number mother seek breastfeeding help discharge hospital compare group . - To determine kind perceived effectiveness breastfeed support advice give infant 's primary physician throughout child 's first six month life . 2.1 Summary : Breastfeeding confers many advantage infant , mother , family , society general . There strong evidence human milk feeding decrease incidence many infectious disease enhance immunologic status newborn . It associate enhanced performance neurocognitive development test , also show provide important health benefit mother , include decrease risk breast ovarian cancer . It strongly encourage first six month life , continue 2 year beyond , recommend World Health Organization 's Innocent Declaration . Neonatal jaundice common problem full-term infant immediate post-natal period . There controversy whether breastfeed increase incidence jaundice first day life . In study conduct Italy , neonatal jaundice associate breastfeed per se , rather increase weight loss birth subsequent fasting , see inadequate lactation . When infant hospitalize , previously establish pattern breastfeed difficult maintain . There evidence suggest mother young infant admit hospital hyperbilirubinemia commonly experience guilt feel breastfeed cause jaundice . Many woman struggle feeling failure inadequacy . A study recently conduct principal investigator current study ( CP ) suggest infant admit hospital hyperbilirubinemia may higher rate breastfeed discontinuation baby general population . Previous study show breastfeed support offer various group mother-infant pair significantly increase rate breastfeed 2 6 month age . Given clear health , social economic advantage breastfeed confers mother , infant , society general , need assess effectiveness breastfeed support intervention infant admit hospital jaundice . 2.2 Benefits breastfeed Breastfeeding preferred infant , exclusive breastfeeding infant recommend first 6 month birth . Research show human milk feeding decrease incidence multiple illness include bacterial meningitis , bacteremia , diarrhea , respiratory tract infection , otitis medium , urinary tract infection . A recent study conduct Spain show exclusive breastfeeding lower risk hospitalization result infectious disease first year life . In study , additional month exclusive breastfeeding would avoid 30 % hospital admission . A meta-analysis 33 study examine healthy infant develop nation show similar result , formula-fed infant experience triple severe respiratory illness compare exclusively breastfed 4 month . Based result , breastfeed promotion lead important economical gain societal perspective . According recent Ottawa Public Health Survey , breastfeed rate general population follow : 91 % woman initiate breastfeeding , 56 % practice exclusive breastfeeding ( fluids breast milk ) . At 3 month , 71 % woman continue breastfeed , 50 % exclusive breastfeeding . This number drop 60 % breastfeed 6 month , 39 % woman exclusively breastfeed . 2.3 Breastfeeding hospitalize child Published report show previously establish pattern breastfeed hard maintain infant hospitalize . Moreover , mention , evidence suggest mother infant admit hospital jaundice experience guilt , well feeling failure inadequacy often feel responsible child 's admission hospital . Maternal confidence show strong predictor breastfeed duration , lack confidence breastfeeding skill lead high likelihood wean first six week post-partum . There one study literature examine rate breastfeed jaundiced population , do PI current study . Surveys send mother eligible infant admit jaundice Children 's Hospital Eastern Ontario ( CHEO ) 2.5 year period . One hundred twenty-eight ( 64 % ) 200 eligible mother return complete survey . Of , 92 % post-secondary education . Information collect , retrospectively , length breastfeed discharge hospital . Length breastfeed hospitalized infant compare Ottawa population , report City Ottawa Public Health survey 2005 . Although number jaundiced group City Ottawa group , likely high education level study participant falsely elevated rate breastfeeding jaundice infant . As mention , 92 % study participant complete post-secondary education , compare 53 % woman involve population-based survey . Given previous report show woman low level education likely discontinue breastfeed early , reasonable postulate comparable level education , mother infant admit hospital jaundice discontinue breastfeed early woman general population . 2.4 Breastfeeding support intervention There study quantify effect breastfeed promotion intervention . A recent Cochrane review find professional lay support effective prolonging breastfeeding .

Short-term breastfeeding study describe anywhere 2 6 month . The education intervention primarily conduct lactation specialist nurse antepartum session , support intervention vary telephone in-person conversation , hospital home visit lactation consultant , nurse peer counselor , combine prearrange appointment unscheduled visit telephone call problem . Breastfeeding education support big effect initiation maintenance breastfeed . Many study however lack scientific rigor . Most study make difference exclusive partial breastfeeding . Details regard description length intervention well train individual deliver educational session often lack . A recent randomized control trial evaluate effectiveness breastfeed promotion intervention Republic Belarus19 find absolute increase almost 37 % prevalence exclusive breastfeed 3 month intervention group . The chief obstetrician intervention maternity hospital , chief pediatrician intervention polyclinic , receive 18-hour course emphasize method maintain lactation , promote exclusive prolonged breastfeeding , resolve common problem . All midwife , nurse physicians provide care study mother infant , well pediatricians nurse work polyclinics trained period 12 16 month . Such program offer advantage provide reliable consistent support , goal widely available . This study publish Cochrane review thus include review . Although study publish date determine aspect breastfeed support intervention yield positive result , likely result combination factor . Breastfeeding support result increase confidence , maternal confidence know strong predictor breastfeed outcome , lack confidence breastfeeding skill lead high likelihood wean first six week post-partum . 2.5 Availability breastfeed support In recent CHEO study , 57 % participate mother need seek breastfeed support discharge hospital , suggest receive adequate help hospitalize . Half woman receive help private lactation consultant . These lactation consultant variable training may may hold recognize certification credential . Their fee also vary 10 $ 90 $ hour , therefore may suitable alternative family financial difficulty . This indicate need standardize breastfeed support intervention accessible . 2.6 Breastfeeding health care professional Many study show physician physician train lack necessary skill offer proper guidance lactate mother . Freed et al survey pediatric resident practitioner breastfeed knowledge find group considerable knowledge deficit , ill-prepared counseling mother lactation difficulty . Many resident survey study perform Hillenbrand et al believe early supplementation cause breast-feeding failure , although previous study clearly demonstrate relationship . In Ottawa study , 3.9 % woman report receive breastfeed help treat physician admit hospital , suggest possibility physician adequate knowledge ass proper breastfeed method counsel appropriately . In summary , need comprehensive study examine impact breastfeed support intervention mother infant admit hospital jaundice . This study clarify rate early breastfeed discontinuation jaundice population help determine whether physician Ottawa population knowledge deficit come breastfeed , may role incorporate teach breastfeed skill physician physician train .</detailed_description>
