	<brief_summary>The investigator aim learn respiratory infection young child community . To prepare large project , investigator conduct study get information best way collect transport respiratory specimens young child . The investigator would like test whether parent likely collect simple respiratory specimen child 's illness , compare likelihood specimen collection home visit make health care worker . Further , investigator want compare likelihood virus identify group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Respiratory Sample Collection Parent Healthcare Worker</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior study , one small study conduct Netherlands compare parent-collected specimen home collection health care worker ( HCW ) arrange home visit . This study suggest despite approximately number illness identify group , parent collection group high proportion ARIs specimen collect ( 43 % vs 24 % , parent v HCW home visit ) , high proportion specimen test positive virus ( 80 % vs 67 % ) , although neither finding statistically significant . In order prepare large , community base study , would like test finding environment . Community-based respiratory infection research traditionally conduct home visit health care worker illness collect sample , nasopharyngeal aspirate . This method potential result non-reporting illness failure collect specimen due invasive nature specimen collection difficulty arrange home visit time convenient parent staff . This may bias finding interfere generalisability . Home collection simple respiratory sample recently demonstrate easy acceptable method conduct community-based respiratory research . Members group involve large , community-based study Melbourne involve 234 child family 12-month period . On study parent successfully keep daily respiratory symptom diary collect combined nose-throat swab child illness meet definition acute respiratory illness ( ARI ) interest . These study method acceptable 87 % parent reporting , end study , would willing continue study least another year . Since study , parent collection simple respiratory specimen validate hospital setting use home set . We previously show swab combine viral transport medium-soaked sponge secure transport tube efficient safe way transport respiratory swab . The method complies guideline transport clinical specimen . As part study , use system allow transport respiratory specimen Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases ( Qpid ) Laboratory normal surface mail , thereby allow study family manage specimen collection return without intervention study staff member . Flocked swabs combination specific viral transport medium recently add specimen collection option , allow simple sensitive specimen collection whilst avoid invasive nasopharyngeal aspirate wash . With study , plan compare parent health care worker collection use flocked swab , specimen return laboratory normal surface mail .</detailed_description>
