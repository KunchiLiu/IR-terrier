	<brief_summary>The project examine mobility performance real life task environment impact use specific type wheel mobility device ( wheeled walker , manual wheelchair , power wheelchair/scooter ) . Specifically , project : 1 ) randomly recruit person prescribe mobility aid within precede 1 year currently use mobility aid , 2 ) define key mobility task within public environment , 3 ) measure mobility performance subject perform mobility task four device , 4 ) synthesize disseminate result . Study result use establish baseline performance data researcher clinician identify design improvement wheelchairs use community dwell elder . All study participant require complete study relate questionnaire family environment familiarity various type mobility aid . In addition , physical ability measure start study , include measure arm leg strength , ability walk push wheelchair . This take 30 minute . A total 150 subject recruit among Veterans prescribe mobility aid precede 3-12 month identify administrative data source . The mobility aid study standard type mobility aid use people limited mobility ( e.g. , wheeled walker , manual wheelchair , power wheelchair/scooter ) . Analyses proceed stepwise fashion . The first step examine primary study question relate device type dependent variable , velocity primary outcome . The next step analysis determine interaction medical condition , mobility device , dependent variable . Finally , exploratory analysis carry examine relationship baseline measure physical function mobility performance device . Study related risk minimal .</brief_summary>
