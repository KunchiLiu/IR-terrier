	<brief_summary>The primary aim study evaluate feasibility deliver 42.5 Gy breast concomitant 10 Gy boost tumour bed 16 fraction total duration 3.5 week use intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) . The primary end-point proportion patient treat without major treatment deviation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concurrent Boost Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rather sequential boost , propose deliver concomitant boost use intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) . IMRT sophisticate technique deliberately use multiple non-uniform beam , result complex , conformal dose distribution . This technique offer several advantage . A concomitant IMRT boost potentially offer improved dose distribution allow conformal dos around boost volume increase spar remain breast adjacent organ risk . Several study show well target dose homogeneity result less toxicity adjuvant breast IMRT . One study find significant reduction rate moist desquamation IMRT compare wedge tangential field ( 31 % vs. 48 % , P=0.0014 ) . Longer treatment duration increase inconvenience decrease patient compliance . Furthermore , place extra financial emotional hardship patient family , particularly must travel long distance home treatment centre . Studies find 10-30 % patient receive adjuvant radiotherapy lumpectomy , place patient high risk local recurrence death disease . Radiobiologically , boost increase risk late normal tissue effect . In EORTC study , find significantly high limited rate severe fibrosis 10 year 4.4 % vs. 1.6 % ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) boost . No age effect note incidence fibrosis . One study compare shorter hypofractionated schedule 42.5 Gy/16 fraction 3.5 week standard schedule 50 Gy/25 fraction 5 week observe comparable 5 year local recurrence rate cosmetic outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Female patient new histological diagnosis invasive carcinoma OR ductal carcinomainsitu ( DCIS ) breast evidence metastatic disease . 2 . Any following indication boost radiotherapy tumour bed : 1 . Age ≤ 60 year 2 . Positive close resection margin ( ≤ 2 mm ) 3 . Lymphovascular space invasion 4 . Extensive intraductal component ( DCIS &gt; 25 % tumour volume ) 3 . Three few axillary node involve determine either : 1 . Sentinel node biopsy OR 2 . Axillary node dissection OR 3 . Clinical exam patient DCIS age great 70 year age . 4 . Informed consent . 1 . Age &lt; 18 year . 2 . Seroma surgical cavity CT estimate &gt; 30 % breast volume . 3 . More one primary tumour different quadrant breast . 4 . Previous irradiation ipsilateral breast would preclude whole breast irradiation . 5 . Presence ipsilateral breast implant pacemaker . 6 . Serious nonmalignant disease ( e.g . cardiovascular , pulmonary , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , scleroderma ) would preclude definitive radiation treatment . 7 . For patient treat adjuvant chemotherapy : unable commence radiation therapy within 12 week last surgical procedure breast . 8 . For patient treat adjuvant chemotherapy : unable commence within 8 week last dose chemotherapy . 9 . Previous concomitant malignancy except patient nonmelanoma skin cancer , contralateral noninvasive breast cancer carcinoma situ site . In addition , patient invasive cancer treat 5 year previously without evidence recurrence eligible . 10 . Currently pregnant lactating . 11 . Psychiatric addictive disorder would preclude obtain informed consent adherence protocol . 12 . Geographic inaccessibility followup . 13 . Regional lymphatic irradiation plan .</criteria>
