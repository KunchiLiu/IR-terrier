	<brief_title>Stress Management Biomarkers Risk Cardiac Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) lead cause death United States roughly half case first clinical manifestation , myocardial infarction ( MI ) sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) , fatal . There considerable evidence `` stress '' play significant independent role occurrence CHD complication . This evidence provide rationale develop interventional strategy reduce stress susceptible individual order modify natural history clinical event . There promise data suggest stress management training ( SMT ) one approach , SMT beneficial effect psychosocial medical outcome . However , many randomize clinical trial ( RCTs ) employ stress management approach CHD patient important methodological limitation several large RCTs fail demonstrate benefit SMT usual care , raise question value SMT patient CHD . Reliance `` hard '' clinical endpoint problematic study require large sample size logistically difficult conduct prohibitively expensive . The use intermediate pathophysiologic endpoint show independently associate increase risk represent novel excite opportunity examine add value SMT exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) compare CR without SMT key biomarkers risk vulnerable CHD patient . This 12-week study enroll adult stable CHD eligible CR . Participants randomly assign either standard cardiac rehabilitation standard cardiac rehabilitation enhance weekly SMT . Prior randomization , medical screening , standardize psychosocial questionnaire , mental stress testing , assessment diet physical activity , exercise testing conduct . Additional biomarkers risk assessed measure flow-mediated vasodilation , inflammation , platelet function , stress hormone , baroreflex , heart rate variability . Participants assign CR alone engage supervised exercise routines 3 time per week . Participants encourage maintain consistent exercise duration effort throughout session . Participants assign CR enhance SMT engage standard exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation also receive weekly group SMT . At conclusion 12-week intervention , participant return repeat assessment stress biomarker measure . At 6 month , 12 month , annually 4 year participant contact information regard major adverse cardiovascular event , medical event medication use . Additionally group age , gender , disease match cardiac patient refer CR , time interval , elect participate CR form non-randomized comparison group cardiac event . Overall , 164 participant consent study participation Duke University Medical Center . Of , 151 participant randomize either Standard Cardiac Rehabilitation Enhanced Cardiac Rehabilitation . Post-intervention assessment complete 145 participant .</detailed_description>
