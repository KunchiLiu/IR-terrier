	<brief_summary>Depressive disorder common patient Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) , occur 47 % patient . Left untreated , symptom strong negative impact quality-of-life , also increase risk future cardiac event death . Unfortunately , 64 % CAD patient respond current antidepressant treatment . Eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) two omega-3 ( ω-3 ) fatty acid find fatty fish important brain function . Recent evidence show depressed CAD patient low level EPA DHA non-depressed CAD patient . This information , take together known role ω-3 fatty acid brain function , suggest deficiency may contribute depression . However , unknown increase consumption ω-3 fatty acid would alleviate depression improve quality life . While intake adequate level ω-3 fatty acid difficult obtain diet , concentrated supplement contain EPA DHA safe , readily available , inexpensive obtainable Canada . CAROTID ( CAD Randomized Omega-3 Trial In Depression ) randomize patient CAD , without depressive symptom , 6 month cardiac rehabilitation usual care receive either ω-3 fatty acid supplement placebo daily final 6 month cardiac rehabilitation . The investigator hypothesize CAD patient randomize receive ω-3 fatty acid supplement show great improvement depressive symptom quality-of-life time . The investigator also evaluate possible improvement important determinant quality life : memory cognitive ability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) pose serious risk health well-being elderly . Depression common among CAD patient major negative impact treatment outcomes life expectancy . Late-life depression also associate symptom cognitive impairment subsequent nonresponse medication . Coronary artery disease depression together detrimentally affect autonomous senior , result increase caregiver dependence health care resource use . Forty-seven percent patient CAD depressive disorder . About 64 % respond antidepressant treatment . Recent evidence show depress CAD patient low level omega-3 fatty acid non-depressed CAD patient . Along known role omega-3 fatty acid brain health , suggest deficiency may affect depression . Our study , CAROTID ( CAD Randomized Omega-3 Trial In Depression ) , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled parallel group trial person CAD attend cardiac rehabilitation program . Patients receive either omega-3 fatty acid supplement placebo daily three month cardiac rehab . We hypothesize patient receive omega-3 fatty acid show great improvement depressive symptom quality life . This research determine whether antidepressant effect omega-3 fatty acid CAD patient undergo cardiac rehabilitation . If successful , CAROTID provide evidence guide health care provider recommendation use supplement .</detailed_description>
