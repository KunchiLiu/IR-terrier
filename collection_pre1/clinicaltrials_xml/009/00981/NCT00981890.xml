	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine maximum dose sunitinib tolerate treatment combine radiotherapy . Patients decide take part study start take sunitinib alone 7 day . On seventh day take sunitinib , patient give stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) . The dose radiation patient receive give SRS standard dose use help shrink brain metastasis . The dose radiation way deliver experimental . Patients continue take sunitinib seven day per week SRS , depend far along study join , may continue take drug 13 week SRS . Patients undergo weekly assessment study treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Brain metastasis occur 20 % 40 % patient cancer , incidence 10 time higher primary malignant brain tumour . The reported median survival patient brain metastases 1-2 month corticosteroid 5-7 month whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) . But improvement neuroimaging , brain metastasis diagnose frequently low burden disease , approximately 50-60 % patient 1 4 brain metastasis diagnosis . In patient , stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) , single high dose radiation deliver high precision target lesion , use increasingly alternative surgical resection adjunct WBRT . The addition SRS WBRT provide improvement local control functional autonomy patient oligometastatic brain disease , support hypothesis SRS increase efficacy tumour resistant significantly low dos use WBRT . SRS accomplish destruction define intracranial target precise target high dose radiation sharp dose fall target boundary minimal damage surround tissue . Brain metastasis well suit SRS often small , radiographically well-circumscribed , pseudo-spherical tumor non-infiltrative , often locate gray-white junction , toxicity critical structure minimal . SRS toxicity low ( &lt; 5 % ) .</detailed_description>
