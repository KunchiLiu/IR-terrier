	<brief_title>Tinzaparin Primary Treatment Extended Secondary Prophylaxis Venous Thromboembolism Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study use long-term administration low molecular weight heparin ( tinzaparin ) primary treatment secondary prophylaxis venous thromboembolism patient cancer . We determine efficacy ( recurrent VTE ) safety ( major hemorrhage ) approach . Secondarily , analyze outcome patient term survival response therapy versus match control . We also determine baseline level marker hemostasis , fibrinolysis , angiogenesis follow change treatment well correlate level plasma marker outcome , include recurrent venous thromboembolism , major hemorrhage , survival .</detailed_description>
