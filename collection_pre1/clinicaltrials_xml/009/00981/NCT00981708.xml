	<brief_title>Lenalidomide , Dexamethasone Cyclophosphamide Amyloidosis ( AL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary systemic amyloidosis ( AL ) plasma cell dyscrasia amyloid fibril form monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain deposit various organ cause tissue damage dysfunction . It rare disease incidence 8 patient per million per year . Virtually patient die disease median survival 12-18 month less approximately 5 % survive 10 year . The current therapeutic approach systemic amyloidosis base observation amyloid deposit reabsorb organ function restore concentration amyloidogenic precursor reduce . The recognized standard treatment patient amyloidosis alkylating agent-based chemotherapy - select patient treated high dose melphalan autologous stem cell transplantation . Recent study lead improved understanding biology plasma cell . Interactions bone marrow microenvironment plasma cell critical growth regulate influence myeloma cell . Thalidomide show significant activity multiple myeloma patient relapse refractory disease even newly diagnose patient . However , thalidomide cause somnolence , fatigue , constipation , peripheral neuropathy well tolerated patient AL amyloidosis . Lenalidomide small molecule structurally related thalidomide potent immunomodulatory effect . Lenalidomide find significantly active relapse multiple myeloma vitro Phase I , II III clinical trial , include patient previously fail thalidomide . Unlike thalidomide , lenalidomide cause significant sedation , constipation , neuropathy , rash . Deep vein thrombosis , especially combination dexamethasone , report . Combination thalidomide alkylating agent ( melphalan cyclophosphamide ) active patient myeloma superior activity combination alkylating agent steroids alone . However , toxicity profile thalidomide problematic combination patient AL . combination lenalidomide alkylating agent ( Melphalan + prednisone +Lenalidomide ) feasible active patient multiple myeloma . Cyclophosphamide favorable toxicity profile melphalan use oral combination dexamethasone thalidomide . However , give remarkable antimyeloma activity lenalidomide , overall improve toxicity profile lenalidomide compare thalidomide need improved treatment incurable malignancy , combination lenalidomide worthy study . Preliminary data Mayo clinic use CC-5013 dexamethasone demonstrate lenalidomide tolerable activity patient AL amyloidosis may useful patient AL amyloidosis either candidate high dose chemotherapy peripheral blood stem cell transplantation fail prior therapy . Efficacy tolerability oral cyclophosphamide , combine dexamethasone thalidomide , well documented patient refractory relapse multiple myeloma combination use patient AL amyloidosis . Intermediate dose dexamethasone tolerable without significant toxicity patient AL amyloidosis . The combination alkylating agent thalidomide dexamethasone effective patient AL amyloidosis . The combination alkylating agent Lenalidomide intermediate dose dexamethasone may lead rapid hematologic response either agent alone , subsequently may lead increase organ response rate . Therefore , phase I/II trial explore safety efficacy combination alkylating agent cyclophosphamide lenalidomide intermediate dose dexamethasone patient candidate high dose melphalan chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation .</detailed_description>
