	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : The investigator suspect significant degree iron overload subject SCD result decrease red cell survival , abnormal endothelial function markedly dysregulated autonomic function . Furthermore , investigator anticipate magnitude effect proportional magnitude total body iron store also duration exposure high iron level tissue . Primary objective To determine red cell survival assess 51Cr red cell survival analysis , hemoglobin level , reticulocyte count , lactic acid dehydrogenase , plasma hemoglobin sickle cell patient related degree iron overload . Secondary objective ( ) 1 . Determine magnitude endothelial-dependant vasodilation relate The degree iron overload . 2 . Determine degree change cardiac beat beat variability response hypoxic exposure cold exposure ( `` cold-face-test '' ) relate magnitude iron overload . The primary measure iron overload MRI determination liver iron concentration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Importance Treating Iron Overload Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients sickle cell anemia often require blood transfusion part treatment disease . Since teaspoon pack red blood cell contain 5 mg iron human way get rid excess iron , level iron sickle cell patient increase rapidly transfusion . Too much iron extremely dangerous cause damage blood vessel , red blood cell , liver , hormone produce gland heart . It difficult know damage due iron overload sickle cell patient sickle cell disease cause organ damage organ affect iron . The purpose project demonstrate iron overload significantly increase morbidity sickle cell disease treatment iron overload ExjadeÂ® prevent attenuate iron-related morbidity . To accomplish screen sickle cell patient history many blood transfusion see high iron level . Then treat patient high iron level drug remove iron . Only patient high iron level eligible treatment . These patient transfuse many time currently blood transfusion . Before start treatment test level anemia , fast red cell destroy , well blood vessel work well heart work . When treatment , repeat test see improvement . To qualify study , must carry diagnosis sickle cell anemia must receive 10 blood transfusion life . You also currently regular transfusion program get blood transfusion regularly plan three time year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient sickle cell anemia ( SS SB thalassemia ) transfusional iron overload . Currently chronic frequent transfusion Age equal great 14 year Patients iron overload repeat blood transfusion , define one following : 1 . For patient great 16 year old receive simple transfusion : estimate lifetime history receipt least 100 ml/kg 15 adult unit pack red blood cell , OR 2 . For patient equal less 16 year old receive simple transfusion : estimate lifetime history receipt least 100 ml/kg pack red blood cell , OR 3 . For patient : liver iron content equal/greater 3 mg Fe/g dw measure biopsy magnetic resonance image adequately chelate since measurement , OR 4. serum ferritin equal/greater 1000 ng/mL least two occasion , least two week apart , prior year . Samples must obtain absence concomitant infection Life expectancy equal/greater 12 month Sexually active woman must use effective method contraception , must undergo clinically document total hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy , tubal ligation postmenopausal ( define amenorrhea least 12 month ) Inclusion criterion treatment pilot study Meets inclusion criterion screen LIC MRI great equal 8 mg/g . Blood transfusion within 12 week day 0 hemolysis lab Currently require blood transfusion three time year . Contraindication MRI , include cardiac pacemaker , brain aneurysm clip , implanted neurostimulator , insulin pump , cochlear implant , metal sliver eye , intrauterine device MRI incompatible metal implant intractable claustrophobia . Serum creatinine upper limit normal Concomitant treatment erythropoietin analog . AST ALT great 250 U/L screening ( patient may rescreened later date cause elevation know due transient process ) . Patients receive currently chelation ask stop one week start restart Exjade .
