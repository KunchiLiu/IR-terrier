	<brief_title>Cerebral Autoregulation Monitoring During Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain injury cardiac surgery result primarily cerebral embolism and/or reduce cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) . The latter particular concern grow number surgical patient age and/or cerebral vascular disease . Normally , CBF physiologically autoregulated ( keep constant ) within range blood pressure allow stable cerebral O2 supply commensurate metabolic demand . Cerebral autoregulation impair patient undergo cardiac surgery cerebral vascular disease many others due condition . This could lead brain injury since current practice target low mean arterial blood pressure empirically ( usually 50-70 mmHg ) cardiopulmonary bypass may expose patient impaired cerebral autoregulation cerebral hypoperfusion . The hypothesis proposal target mean arterial pressure cardiopulmonary bypass level individual 's low autoregulatory threshold reduces risk brain injury patient undergoing cardiac surgery . Monitoring cerebral autoregulation perform real time use software continuously compare relation arterial blood pressure CBF velocity middle cerebral artery measure transcranial Doppler cerebral oximetry measure near infrared spectroscopy . The primary end-point study comprehensive composite outcome clinical stroke , cognitive decline , and/or new ischemic brain lesion detect diffusion weight magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging . Autoregulation mediate reactivity cerebral resistance vessel . A secondary aim proposal evaluate whether near infrared reflectance spectroscopy use trend change cerebral blood volume provide reliable monitor vascular reactivity ( hemoglobin volume index ) . Assessments extra-cranial intra-cranial arterial stenosis perform use MR angiography control potential confounding variable analysis . Finally , additional aim study ass whether preoperative transcranial Doppler examination major cerebral artery identify patient prone composite neurological end-point . Near infrared oximetry non-invasive , continuous , require little care-giver intervention , thus , could widely use individualize patient blood pressure management surgery . Brain injury cardiac surgery important source operative mortality , prolonged hospitalization , increase health care expenditure , impaired quality life . Developing strategy reduce burden complication wide public health implication .</detailed_description>
