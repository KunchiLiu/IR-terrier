	<brief_summary>Background . Patients , especially child , steroid-dependent multirelapsing nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) secondary minimal change disease ( MCD ) idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) continuous treatment steroid and/or immunosuppressive agent limit prevent recurrence increase risk severe drug-related adverse event . Case report suggest Rituximab , B cell deplete monoclonal antibody , could safe effective alternative steroid immunosuppressant achieve maintain remission population . Objectives . The study primarily aim evaluate whether Rituximab may maintain stable NS remission taper withdrawal steroid immunosuppressive therapy patient MCD FSGS steroid-dependent multirelapsing NS . Secondarily , study ass whether Rituximab allow reduce maintenance dos steroids immunosuppressant ( relapse ) , thus limit treatment related side effect cost . Methods . This prospective , sequential , open , study include 20 patient histology evidence MCD FSGS steroid-dependant multirelapsing NS , stable complete partial remission since least 1 month , base previous history , expect invariably relapse steroid/immunosuppression withdrawal . After baseline evaluation clinical , laboratory kidney function parameter [ include glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , renal plasma flow ( RPF ) , albumin sodium fractional clearance glomerular albumin permeability assay ( Palb ) ] , patient receive one Rituximab infusion repeat 1 week later CD20 cell fully deplete circulation . Then ongoing immunosuppression progressively taper complete withdrawal 6 9 month . 24h proteinuria monitor monthly spot urine test daily albustix early detect disease relapse . Baseline evaluation repeat study end ( 1 year ) . Relapses treat high-dose steroid per center practice last immunosuppressive therapy effective preventing disease reactivation reintroduce . Expected result . Rituximab expect prevent NS recurrence follow taper discontinuation steroid immunosuppressant . Maintaining remission without chronic immunosuppression expect minimize risk cost therapy remarkably improve patient outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Multirelapsing Minimal Change Disease ( MCD ) Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) affect 2 every 100,000 child young 16 year . Minimal change disease ( MCD ) account around 90 percent case remain one associate focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) . Patients NS increase risk life-threatening infection thromboembolic episode , often affect dyslipidemia osteoporosis . Glucocorticoids first-line treatment may achieve remission 90 % patient MCD 20 60 % FSGS . In 20 % 60 % achieve remission , however , steroid withdrawal follow recurrence disease . These patient require chronic steroid therapy ( steroid-dependent case ) : prevents relapse case invariably associate severe adverse effect include growth retardation , infection , malignancy , hypertension , impair glucose tolerance , weight gain somatic change . In small proportion patient , recurrence occur even chronic steroid therapy ( multirelapsing case ) . In case , several approach use control disease activity include plasmapheresis add-on therapy cyclophosphamide , cyclosporine , mycophenolate mofetil immunosuppressant . Chronic immunosuppression , however , seldom achieves persistent remission invariably burden serious adverse effect include gonadotoxicity sterility , opportunistic infection , malignancy , bone marrow depression renal toxicity . Thus , safer effective treatment urgently need patient . Rituximab , chimeric monoclonal antibody target CD20 antigen B cell able induce antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis cell , report effective child NS secondary MCD FSGS unresponsive immunosuppressive treatment . Rituximab achieve persistent NS remission patient MCD diagnose age 30 yrs history frequent relapse refractory treatment immunosuppressant . Thus , chronic MCD persist adult-years may respond rituximab sustain remission possible despite long-term disease treatment fail . Along line , rituximab achieve prompt persistent remission adult steroid mycophenolate mofetil-resistant MCD two patient FSGS steroid-resistant NS . The finding suggest rituximab may role treatment patient require chronic exposure steroid and/or immunosuppressant prevent limit disease reactivation . Thus , main goal present study ass whether rituximab administration may allow taper withdraw ongoing treatment without expose patient risk disease recurrence . AIMS Primary - To evaluate whether Rituximab therapy able prevent NS recurrence complete withdrawal steroid immunosuppressive treatment patient steroid-dependant multirelapsing NS sustain remission least 1 month . Secondary - To assess whether Rituximab therapy may reduce need steroid immunosuppressive agent prevent treat disease relapse ; - To evaluate whether taper withdrawal immunosuppressant therapy associate regression relate toxicity , growth retardation , hypertension , impair glucose tolerance dyslipidemia ; - To assess whether persistent NS remission associate improvement kidney function renal hemodynamics ; - To study whether proteinuria remission associate disappearance albumin permeability factor ( ) patient 's serum ; - To assess safety profile rituximab treatment ; - To evaluate cost/effectiveness study treatment .</detailed_description>
