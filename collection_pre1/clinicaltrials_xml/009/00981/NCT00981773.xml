	<brief_summary>The aim study determine whether switch antiretroviral regimen contain abacavir and/or didanosine one contain maraviroc lead reduction platelet reactivity inflammatory marker week 12 24 thereby confer reduction cardiac risk . In addition study ass efficacy maraviroc contain regimen combination boost protease inhibitor term tolerability achieve long term viral suppression assess week 48 . The investigator hypothesize rapid reduction platelet reactivity switch maraviroc boost protease inhibitor combination maraviroc provide safe efficacious antiretroviral regimen enable reduction cardiac risk whilst maintain virological suppression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To assess safety , change platelet reactivity , plasma cardiac biomarkers metabolic parameter HIV 1 infected subject undergo switch ART nucleoside contain regimen include abacavir / didanosine maraviroc contain regimen . 40 HIV-1 infected subject currently receive stable antiretroviral therapy consist boost protease inhibitor two NRTIs include abacavir / didanosine recruit . Subjects randomize 1:1 basis one two arm : Arm 1 ( immediate switch antiretroviral therapy ) - Continue current boost protease inhibitor - Switch NRTI backbone maraviroc 150 mg bid Arm 2 ( continue current antiretroviral therapy ) - No change current antiretroviral therapy twelve week - After twelve week switch therapy per Arm 1 Subjects follow 48 week attend clinic visit screen , baseline , week 4 , 12 , 16 , 24 , 36 48 . Platelet reactivity , inflammatory cardiac biomarkers marker T cell activation assess baseline , week 12 week 24 . Following completion study subject may continue study antiretroviral regimen switch alternative regimen clinician 's discretion . Inclusion Criteria - HIV-1 infected male females - Between 18 65 year age - Signed informed consent - Currently receive stable antiretroviral regimen comprise : - two license NRTIs include abacavir and/or didanosine - license boosted protease inhibitor dose ( exclude tipranavir* ) - Undetectable plasma HIV RNA le 50 copies/mL least 24 week prior screen - Availability store plasma perform tropism assay - CCR5 tropic HIV virus base tropism assay store plasma sample - Willing continue unchanged , modify antiretroviral therapy , accordance randomisation assignment - No documented viral resistance currently license HIV-1 protease inhibitor base either previous HIV-1 genotypic resistance test judgement study investigator - No previous exposure maraviroc CCR5 receptor antagonists - Subjects good health upon medical history , physical exam , laboratory test opinion investigator - Female subject heterosexually active childbearing potential ( i.e. , surgically sterile least two year post menopausal ) must avoid become pregnancy follow screen completion study use one follow method : - barrier contraceptive ( condom , diaphragm spermicide ) - IUD PLUS barrier contraceptive - Female subject childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test . Exclusion criterion - failure current antiretroviral regimen due virological failure - active opportunistic infection , malignancy significant co-morbidities opinion investigator - pregnancy - current prohibit concomitant medication ( list section 4.1.4 ) - available stored plasma sample predate current antiretroviral regimen upon tropism assay perform - active HBV infection evidence positive hepatitis B surface antigen - active hepatitis C virus infection evidence positive HCV PCR HCV antibody</detailed_description>
