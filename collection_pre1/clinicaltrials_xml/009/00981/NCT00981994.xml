	<brief_title>Evaluation Algorithm Reduce Antibiotic Prescribing Acute Bronchitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rapid rise antibiotic resistance among common bacteria adversely affect clinical course health care cost community-acquired infection . Because antibiotic resistance pattern strongly correlate antibiotic use pattern , multiple organization declare reduction unnecessary antibiotic use critical component effort combat antibiotic resistance . Among human , vast majority unnecessary antibiotic prescription use treat acute respiratory tract infection ( ARIs ) viral etiology . In particular , despite fact numerous control trial demonstrate benefit antibiotic therapy patient acute bronchitis , majority patient diagnose acute bronchitis continue receive antibiotic therapy across diverse treatment setting . Recently , National Committee Quality Assurance adopt proportion adult visit diagnose acute bronchitis antibiotic NOT prescribe quality measure within HEDIS data set . Recent result HEDIS dataset emphasize continue high rate antibiotic prescribing patient acute bronchitis . One key factor drive overuse antibiotic management patient low respiratory tract infections—such acute bronchitis—is diagnostic uncertainty inaccurate risk estimation underlie pneumonia patient . Recently , study team observe substantial reduction antibiotic prescribe follow incorporation diagnostic treatment algorithm acute care set . This acute cough management algorithm incorporate data vital sign symptom distinguish patient community-acquired pneumonia patient acute cough illness , specifically acute bronchitis . The acute cough management algorithm become even valuable recent year due introduction quality measure emphasize timely administration antibiotic patient community-acquired pneumonia . Thus , strong empirical evidence effectiveness algorithm could lead wide adoption algorithm substantial improvement antibiotic prescribing . The investigative team proposing unique partnership Geisinger Health System , large integrate health network , implement evaluate algorithm . Utilizing cluster-randomized trial design across 33 practice site , address follow aim : 1 ) To measure reduction antibiotic prescribing result incorporation algorithm compare usual care sit utilize two different implementation strategy , one poster-based one electronic health record-based , 2 ) To measure revisits , delayed hospitalization net economic cost associate algorithm implementation , 3 ) To evaluate local practice characteristic influence level implementation ultimate performance success intervention site . In final component study , investigator partner NCQA disseminate study result national network participate plan stimulate wide spread adoption algorithm quality improvement method .</detailed_description>
