	<detailed_description>The study sample consist evaluable participant , child young 7 year age . Participants receive EUR-1008 ( APT-1008 ) Microtabs formulation . The study design involve 4-day screening period , 7-day dose stabilization period , 7-day treatment period ( exclude end-of-study evaluation ) . The optimal dose EUR-1008 ( APT-1008 ) Microtabs , determine dose stabilization period , use treatment period . Participants instructed consume predefined diet .</detailed_description>
