	<brief_summary>The final purpose study determine whether bronchodilation cigarette smoke Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) patient interact , result increase cardiovascular disease . The aim part study demonstrate basic mechanism : Does increase respiratory function administration bronchodilator patient COPD lead elevate pulmonary retention harmful compound inhale cigarette smoke short-term biological effect associate cardiovascular disease ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interaction Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Experiment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD currently one frequent disease . In 80 % COPD patient , disease cause smoking . About half COPD patient active smoker , although smoking also important prognostic factor . Also , smoke important cause well important prognostic factor cardiovascular disease . The corner stone medical treatment COPD bronchodilation ; half patient use long-acting bronchodilator . An increase pathogenic effect smoking increase lung function bronchodilation likely though , since pathogenic particle would penetrate lung . We hypothesize bronchodilator increase cardiovascular disease COPD patient smoke . In order demonstrate basic mechanism hypothesis , COPD patient receive bronchodilator one time placebo another time , precede follow cigarette smoke one hour strict time schedule . Smoke retention , lung function blood biomarkers repeatedly measure .</detailed_description>
