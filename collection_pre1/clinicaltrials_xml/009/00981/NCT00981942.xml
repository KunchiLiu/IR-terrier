	<brief_summary>The investigator study effect imatinib mesylate ( Glivec ) treatment moderate severe nephrogenic systemic fibrosis ( NSF ) . So far evidence adequately effective treatment option NSF . Various treatment try stop progressing disease . Corticosteroids , suppress early inflammatory stage disease , fail halt disease progression . Other immunosuppressive agent , photopheresis , kidney transplantation report partly beneficial patient . It possible confirm finding study photopheresis , kidney transplantation , effect generally unreproducible .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>NSF relatively newly define fibrosing disease describe 1997 Gadolinium-based contrast agent ( GBCAs ) introduce patient kidney disease . The association NSF GBCA many study show strong . Until recently , radiologists believe commercially available GBCAs safe use whether renal function normal . Since 1980s , &gt; 200 million patient give agent . Lately , occurrence NSF , relatively new chronic disorder , give serious speculation safety drug question future use . First identified 1997 , describe 2000 , NSF report patient acute chronic severe renal insufficiency ( glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) . Fibrosis subcutis mean skin hardens lose flexibility . Hard dermal plaque change often appear leg , arm abdomen together dyspigmentation . As lesion involve deep part subcutis muscle often affect . Involvement joint lead contracture narrow movement . Patients massive affection joint often end zimmer frame wheelchair . The connect tissue inner vital organ may also affect NSF accelerate death patient . The retained gadolinium lesion NSF find year administration . Interestingly , case report suggest beneficial effect imatinib mesylate two patient . Two independent case report also show promising result . Imatinib mesylate inhibits several tyrosine kinase involve fibrotic reaction , one main pathogenetic component NSF .</detailed_description>
