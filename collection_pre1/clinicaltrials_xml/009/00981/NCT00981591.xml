	<brief_title>Inhaled Iloprost Adjunct Inhaled Nitric Oxide Pediatric Critical Care Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inhaled nitric oxide ( NO ) use management cause pediatric pulmonary hypertension . Despite widespread use nitric oxide treat critically ill mechanically-ventilated pediatric patient pulmonary hypertension , response therapy universal . Nitric oxide fails improve oxygenation approximately 30 % patient . Nonresponders nitric oxide treatment option . Iloprost medication approve inhalational delivery treatment pulmonary hypertension . Inhalation therapy pulmonary vasodilatation critically ill child inherently attractive oral intravenous therapy due ability deliver medication directly lung decrease systemic effect . The use inhale iloprost report decrease pulmonary vascular resistance many pediatric pathologic setting , include combination therapy nitric oxide .</detailed_description>
