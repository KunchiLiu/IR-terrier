	<brief_summary>The research study test investigational drug necitumumab ( IMC-11F8 ) treatment advance non-small cell lung cancer . The aim study determine necitumumab , give together standard chemotherapy combination consist cisplatin gemcitabine effective improving participant disease standard chemotherapy combination alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First-line Treatment Participants With Stage IV Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With Necitumumab Gemcitabine-Cisplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multinational , randomize , multicenter , open-label , Phase III study 1093 participant ( age ≥ 18 year ) histologically- cytologically-confirmed , stage IV squamous-cell NSCLC , receive prior therapy metastatic disease , randomize 1:1 basis receive first-line necitumumab plus chemotherapy consist gemcitabine cisplatin study Arm A , gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy alone study Arm B. Baseline radiographic assessment disease perform within 21 day prior randomization ( first treatment administer within 7 day follow randomization ) . Participants undergo radiographic assessment disease status ( compute tomography magnetic resonance imaging ) every 6 week ( ± 3 day ) , radiographic documentation progressive disease ( PD ) . Chemotherapy continue maximum six cycle arm ( radiographic documentation PD , toxicity require cessation , protocol noncompliance withdrawal consent ) ; participant Arm A continue receive necitumumab radiographic documentation PD , toxicity require cessation , protocol noncompliance , withdrawal consent . After end-of-study-visit ( follow PD ) , follow-up information regard anticancer treatment survival collect every 2 month ( ± 7 day ) . For participant discontinue study reason PD ( eg , symptomatic deterioration ) , information disease progression also collect PD document . Follow-up continue long participant alive , end trial .</detailed_description>
