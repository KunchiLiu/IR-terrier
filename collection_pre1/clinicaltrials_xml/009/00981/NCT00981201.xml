	<brief_title>Celecoxib Chemopreventive Agent Current Former Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COX-2 enzyme think involve development cancer . Celecoxib COX-2 inhibitor . Before treatment begin , participant bronchoscopy ( tissue sample lung ) . This take see different element ( biomarkers ) tissue predict individual high risk develop cancer . In bronchoscopy tube place nose lung ( sedation ) remove tissue sample laboratory analysis ( biopsy ) . Cells also collect bronchoscopy spray lung small amount water remove water ( bronchial lavage , bronchial washing ) . In addition , sputum sample take inside cheek scrap ( buccal sample ) . A complete physical exam perform begin treatment 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 month . During visit , participant ask question tobacco/alcohol exposure . Participants blood take begin treatment 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 month . Urine sample take begin treatment 3 6 month . The research nurse also ask participant adverse sign symptom experience . Participants smoke encouraged stop smoking . Sources assistance stop smoking provide study participant continue smoke . In study , participant randomly pick ( toss coin ) one four treatment group . Treatment study last 6 month . Participants first group receive placebo 6 month . A placebo substance look like study drug inactive . Participants second group receive placebo Months 1-3 Celecoxib Months 4-6 . Participants third group receive Celecoxib Months 1-3 placebo Months 4-6 . Participants fourth group receive Celecoxib 6 month . Neither participant participant 's doctor know treatment group participant assign . Participants equal chance assign group . Participants take 2 capsule twice day 6-month treatment period . The capsule could either placebo study drug . At 3 6 month , participant physical exam , blood test , bronchoscopy . Participants take study medication sip water 2 hour bronchoscopy sip water . Sputum buccal sample also take time . The research nurse ask participant question change and/or addition medication . This investigational study . The use Celecoxib prevention lung cancer investigational . Up 250 individual take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
