	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , mitomycin C , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving radiation therapy together cisplatin may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well radiation therapy give together chemotherapy work treat patient stage I bladder cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate rate freedom radical cystectomy 3 year . Secondary - To evaluate rate freedom radical cystectomy 5 year . - To evaluate rate freedom development distant disease progression 3 5 year . - To evaluate rate freedom progression bladder tumor stage T2 great 3 5 year . - To evaluate disease-specific survival overall survival . - To evaluate incidence acute late pelvic toxicity . - To evaluate efficacy treatment approach prevent recurrence local bladder tumor . - To evaluate potential value tumor histopathology plus molecular genetic , DNA content , urine proteomics parameter possible significant prognostic factor tumor control treatment approach . - To collect American Urological Association symptom score baseline 3 year . OUTLINE : Beginning within 10 week transurethral resection bladder tumor , patient undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy daily 5 day per week week 1-7 ( 34 fraction ) . Patients also receive 1 2 radiosensitizing chemotherapy regimen concurrently radiotherapy . - Regimen I : Patients receive cisplatin IV day 1-3 week 1 , 3 , 5 . - Regimen II : Patients receive mitomycin C IV day 1 radiotherapy fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-5 week 1 4 . Patients persistent tumor re-evaluation may undergo radical cystectomy . Tissue , blood , urine sample may collect periodically biomarker analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>

Patients operable tumor primary high grade urothelial carcinoma bladder exhibit histologic evidence invasion lamina propria ( disease clinical stage T1 ) high grade stage Ta urothelial carcinoma without hydronephrosis . Patients disease involvement prostatic urethra urothelial carcinoma evidence stromal invasion prostate . If patient 's initial tumor high grade Ta urothelial carcinoma his/her recurrent tumor must high grade stage T1 urothelial carcinoma eligible . Patients must high grade urothelial carcinoma stage Ta T1 recur within 540 day completion initial treatment ( transurethral resection bladder tumor [ TURBT ] intravesical bacillus CalmetteGuerin [ BCG ] immunotherapy ) present participate urologist judged BCG therapy contraindicate patient may immunocompromised patient refuse BCG therapy No confirm tumorrelated hydronephrosis No pN+ &gt; T1 disease No histologically cytologically confirm node metastasis If radiologic evaluation lymph node interpret `` positive '' , must evaluate either lymphadenectomy percutaneous needle biopsy No evidence distant metastases Patients radical cystectomy standard next therapy per urologic guideline , judgement participate urologist , eligible Must adequately function bladder judge participate urologist radiation oncologist undergone visibly complete restaging TURBT participate urologist show ( present outside pathology specimen ) T1G2 T1G3 tumor uninvolved muscularis propria specimen , prostatic urethral biopsy mucosal carcinoma present , evidence biopsy prostatic stroma tumor invasion PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Zubrod performance status 01 White blood cell count ( WBC ) ≥ 4,000/mm^3 Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,800/mm^3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm^3 Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL ( transfusion intervention allow ) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL Serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &gt; 25 mL/min ( patient receive cisplatin , GFR &gt; 60 mL/min ) Not pregnant Negative pregnancy test Fertile patient must use effective contraception Able tolerate systemic chemotherapy combine radiotherapy radical cystectomy ( necessary ) , opinion urologist , radiation oncologist , medical oncologist No prior concurrent malignancy site histology ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer , T1a prostate cancer , carcinoma situ uterine cervix ) unless patient diseasefree ≥ 5 year No severe , active comorbidity include follow : Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within past 6 month Transmural myocardial infarction occur within past 6 month Acute bacterial fungal infection require IV antibiotic time registration Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation respiratory illness require hospitalization preclude study therapy time registration Hepatic insufficiency result clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defect AIDS base upon current Centers Disease Control definition ( HIV test require ) No prior allergic reaction cisplatin , mitomycin , 5fluorouracil PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : No prior systemic chemotherapy bladder cancer Prior chemotherapy different cancer allow No prior radiotherapy region cancer would result overlap radiotherapy field No concurrent drug potential nephrotoxicity ototoxicity ( e.g. , aminoglycoside )</criteria>
