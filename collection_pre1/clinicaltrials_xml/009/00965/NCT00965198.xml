	<brief_summary>Intravenous catheter place nearly every hospitalized patient . These catheter , since break skin integrity , potential source infection occur bloodstream . Bloodstream infection result high rate death lengths hospital stay , well increase healthcare cost . Blood drawn medication deliver catheter access device attach catheter . In look new way decrease infection associate healthcare , investigator plan test whether use silver-coated catheter access device ( VLINK ) compare standard , non-coated device ( CLEARLINK ) reduce infection rate . These device identical design silver coating VLINK , impart brown color device . Silver prevent growth bacteria inside device ( biofilm formation ) laboratory , never prove patient . The investigator propose crossover study two Emory-owned hospital ( Emory University Hospital Emory University Hospital Midtown ) , anticipate last 10 month . Currently , type device , ( standard silver-coated ) FDA approve clinical use use hospital . The investigator plan hospital use one type catheter access device period time ( approximately 5 month ) , switch ( `` crossover '' ) type device rest study . All patient admit either hospital ( exclude newborn patient infection attribute hemodialysis catheter ) enrol since device meet standard care . During study , infection prevention department , continue part regular duty measure infection rate . A small subset catheter remove routine clinical care ( none take solely study ) send CDC determine amount bacteria inside catheter catheter access device ( look biofilm ) . Finally , microbiology lab , part routine function determine rate blood culture falsely positive . All measure compare use statistical method see difference standard silver-coated catheter access device . In undertake study , investigator use type vascular access device ( valve , positive pressure ) already use hospital change delivery care patient , rigorous , systematic manner , obtain sample data analysis .</brief_summary>
