	<brief_summary>Diabetic patient excess risk mortality due cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) compare non-diabetics . Cardiovascular disease mortality rate reportedly rise several country region , include urban China , Malaysia , Korea Taiwan . Cardiovascular diseases stroke always number 2 3 killer Taiwanese population recent year , really cost much medical resource . For treat dyslipidemia , one major risk factor CVD , statins well document reduce CV death primary secondary prevention several large-scale trial . It report clinical benefit treat dyslipidemia patient diabetes mellitus least equivalent benefit observe among cardiovascular disease . A meta-analysis seven trial statins find treatment 5 year result 25 % reduction combine outcome coronary heart disease death non-fatal myocardial infarction . Fibrates another group hypolipidemic drug regulate lipid metabolism use quite often daily practice diabetic dyslipidemia , beneficial effect reduce high TG increase low HDL-C , characteristic lipid abnormality commonly see patient diabetes metabolic syndrome . However , recently publish FIELD study , fenofibrate significantly reduce risk primary outcome coronary event 9,795 participant type 2 diabetes mellitus . The high rate start statin therapy patient allocate placebo might mask moderately large treatment benefit . Furthermore , treatment trial back lipid treatment guideline conduct Caucasians data combination therapy fibrate statin publish .</brief_summary>
