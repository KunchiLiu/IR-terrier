	<brief_summary>The investigator study good understand role central nervous system process painful stimuli patient fibromyalgia . Specifically , investigator would like know whether central nervous system process painful stimulus change time talk therapy . In addition , investigator investigate change fibromyalgia symptom may affect certain marker protein blood .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Use Nociceptive Flexion Reflex Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall Design Female patient FM enrol 12-week prospective cohort study . To effect change patient 's symptom , subject ( n=30 ) randomize receive six session phone-based cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) 'usual ' care . CBT provide week 1 ( baseline ) week 6 . Outcome assessment ( i.e. , self-report symptom questionnaire , plasma neuropeptide level NFR ) perform baseline , week 6 week 12 . Subjects complete three test phase study report withdraws , replace need total 30 volunteer complete study : Volunteers ask visit Fibromyalgia Clinical Research Center 3 different occasion : baseline ( Screening ) , week 6 , week 12 . During first visit subject randomly assign one two group . Similar flip coin , 50 % chance assign either one two group : ) telephone-based educational instruction group b ) usual care group . Subjects randomly assign educational instruction group receive one phone call per week first six week study . During phone conversation , receive instruction manage pain . If subject assign educational instruction group , subject must agree allow u audiotape telephone conversation . Audio-taping telephone conversation help u give high quality instruction . On hand , subject assign usual care group receive telephone call research team . During visit subject ask follow : 1 . Complete comprehensive questionnaire ( computer-based traditional paper pen format ) regard fibromyalgia affect daily live . Risks : You may feel uncomfortable care answer particular question . To minimize risk , tell researcher feel uncomfortable wish answer question . 2 . Provide blood sample ( 10 ml ) .The purpose blood test examine change certain blood marker relation change symptom Risks : The physical risk associate participation study blood draw . The process draw blood may cause bleeding , bruising , pain , lightheadedness , minor swell around area needle stick . Occasionally infection bleeding may develop needle place vein . To minimize risk , blood specimen obtain experienced technician . 3 . Undergo nociceptive flexion reflex ( NFR ) test . This test examine body respond painful stimulus . To begin test session , electrode use measure nociceptive flexion reflex attach left leg . To measure reflex , administer series electrical stimulus ankle left foot . After stimulus asked rate stimulus intensity use scale anchor 0 ( sensation ) , 50 ( pain threshold ) , 100 ( maximum tolerable ) . This procedure use determine intensity stimulus require elicit nociceptive flexion reflex response leave hamstring muscle . This reflex small may even notice activity leg muscle . The intensity electrical stimulus increase slowly reflex response show , intensity NEVER exceed rate `` 100 '' ( maximum tolerable ) . At high intensity , electrical stimulus describe others feel like `` brief pinprick '' `` carpet shock '' . We use procedure ass pain tolerance threshold electrical stimulation ankle . Stimulus intensity increase slowly ask rate stimulus 0-100 scale . The procedure end soon provide stimulus intensity rating `` 100 '' ( maximum tolerable ) . Risks : The nociceptive flexion reflex procedure likely elicit temporary discomfort , increase heart rate blood pressure well sensation discomfort pain . Further , preparation skin require apply electrode may mildly irritate uncomfortable , may leave behind redness skin could require day heal . To minimize risk , well trained technician conduct test . It important note test similar EMG ( electromyogram ) study - test commonly do routine medical care .</detailed_description>
