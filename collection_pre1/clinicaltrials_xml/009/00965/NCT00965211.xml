	<detailed_description>Tourette 's syndrome developmental neuropsychiatric disorder characterize stereotypical motor verbal burst call Tics . There small number treatment available disorder , pharmacological agent serious side effect efficient treat . In current study attempt find good solution treatment tourette syndrome use deep Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( dTMS ) technology.our region interest stimulation supplementary motor cortex ( SMA ) . earlier superficial TMS study focus SMA show promising result . In thesis study clinical improvement evident two week treatment , subject even maintain period 3 months.we use similar protocol TMS stimulation use study Mantovani et al ( 2006 ) .The protocol include bilateral stimulation SMA 110 % motor threshold Abductor Policies Brevis frequency 1 Hz . session comprise four cycle 5 minute stimulation 2 minute recess.approximately 20 patient diagnosed tourette syndrome pharmAcological psychotherapy treatment participate . patient recruit Shnider hospital extension subject would undergo rTMS session five day week , four week , use HBDL dTMS coil . coil capable produce magnetic field deeper part cerebral cortex , reason believe produce well clinical outcome superficial TMS coil ( figure 8 ) use past study . Clinical evaluation include Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Scale ( YBOCS ) , Yale Global Tic Severity rating Scale ( YGTSS ) , Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) , Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , Symptoms Check List ( SCL-90 ) , Social Adaptation Self evaluation Scale ( SASS ) , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS-24 ) , Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HARS-14 ) , Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) .These evaluation conduct study entry , 2 week study entry , end treatment phase 2 week follow visit ( total four time ) . Further , clinical evaluation administrate Schneider hospital , treatment conduct cognitive lab Shalvata hospital . Our main objective observe reduction severity symptoms post treatment comparison pre treatment , use YGTSS main outcome measure .</detailed_description>
