	<brief_summary>Background : - Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) developmental disability characterize impaired social interaction repetitive and/or stereotypical behavior . Research study suggest individual ASD low blood cholesterol level . This low cholesterol level abnormal sterol level may important marker subtypes ASD . Providing additional cholesterol diet child ASD may help improve behavior . - These finding guide medical community identify individual test sterol disorder . This study also help researcher learn whether add extra cholesterol diet improve behavioral autism spectrum characteristic see individual ASD low cholesterol . Objectives : - To determine cholesterol level child autism spectrum disorder . - To compare behavioral characteristic among child autism spectrum disorder high , low , normal cholesterol level . - To determine whether add cholesterol diet improve behavioral characteristic individual ASD low cholesterol . Eligibility : - Children age 4 12 diagnosed autism spectrum disorder . Design : - Initial screening study involve collection blood sample ( study purpose cholesterol test ) . - Children low cholesterol level take part study receive either cholesterol supplementation placebo , detailed physical psychological examination measure possible improvement behavioral characteristic . - Children high normal cholesterol level blood sample take , undergo additional set examination comparison purpose . - Researchers may request blood DNA sample family member ( parent sibling ) , collect blood draw cheek swab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pilot work suggest individual autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) low blood cholesterol level . This low cholesterol level abnormal sterol level may important marker subtypes ASD . The propose trial aim characterize clinical difference low-cholesterol ASD normal-or-high-cholesterol ASD test response individual ASD low cholesterol increase cholesterol diet . Evidence role low cholesterol cause ASD subgroup individual come five source . First , half individual Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome ( SLOS ) meet behavioral criterion autistic disorder ( Tierney et al , 2001 ) , three quarter type ASD ( Sikora et al , 2006 ) . Second , individual SLOS , low cholesterol blood cerebrospinal fluid , severe autism IQ adaptive function deficit . Third , SLOS , improvement find social communication ability add dietary cholesterol . Fourth , cholesterol low pilot study 100 child autism unknown cause ( Tierney et al , 2006 ) . Fifth , become increasingly clear cholesterol play pivotal role several aspect brain development . This proposal design 1 ) determine prevalence hypocholesterolemia ASD individual ( ASD+Hypo ) ; 2 ) determine prevalence hypercholesterolemia ( ASD individual ( ASD+Hyper ) ; 3 ) determine rate SLOS ASD subject ; 4 ) determine phenotype ( physical , behavioral , developmental ) less 5th centile ( ASD+Hypo ) great 95th centile ( ASD+Hyper ) individual normal cholesterol ( ASD+Normal ) ASD subject ; 5 ) test efficacy dietary cholesterol supplementation ASD individual hypocholesterolemia ; 6 ) determine whether raise dose cholesterol supplementation effective low dose ; 7 ) create repository biomaterial sample individual ASD biological family member . Three site ( Kennedy Krieger Institute [ KKI ] , Ohio State University [ OSU ] , National Institutes Health [ NIH ] ) collaborate accomplish objective study . In addition defining frequency alter cholesterol homeostasis ASD , 60 youth ( 20 site ) ASD plus hypocholesterolemia enter 12-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial immediately follow 12-week open-label cholesterol trial test efficacy dietary cholesterol supplementation . Outcome measure include standard test behavior , communication , autism feature . These finding guide medical community identify individual test sterol disorder . This study also help researcher learn whether add extra cholesterol diet improve behavioral autism spectrum characteristic see individual ASD low cholesterol . The result study may help individual hypocholesterolemic ASD knowledge therapeutic value safety use cholesterol supplementation biochemically behaviorally . If improvement demonstrate , open new window understand neurologic mechanism ASD . This knowledge may also helpful hypocholesterolemic individual ASD newly identify population benefit supplementation . Even cholesterol supplementation find effective , important behavioral phenotype developmental information obtain might useful identify subject ASD plus cholesterol abnormality .</detailed_description>
