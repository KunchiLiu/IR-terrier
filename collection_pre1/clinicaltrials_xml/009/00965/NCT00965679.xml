	<brief_summary>Background : - Computed tomography ( CT ) create three-dimensional image base X-ray imaging . CT useful determine treatment approach certain disease , calcific aortic stenosis ( narrow aorta calcium deposit ) . - Comparing data receive CT scan data receive heart catheterization ( assess heart 's condition function ) use improve treatment patient certain heart condition . Researchers interested look effectiveness procedure assess possible surgical treatment patient calcific aortic stenosis . Objectives : - To analyze cardiac CT scan conjunction exist heart scan result improve treatment future minimally invasive aortic valve replacement . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old diagnose aortic valve stenosis may treat surgically , undergo recently undergone heart catheterization . Design : - Participants CT scan within 90 day medically necessary heart catheterization , surgical catheter treatment . - During CT scan , patient ask hold breath intermittently 5 20 second . Patients inside scanner less 30 minute . - Patients ask return 3 7 day blood test check kidney function . - Researchers analyze result CT scan conjunction previous result catheterization determine possible improve treatment option .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We collect cardiac compute tomography ( CT ) data patient aortic valve stenosis consider surgical catheter treatment . These data analyze along medically-necessary fluoroscopy cardiac catheterization learn whether combined enhance future minimally invasive valve treatment .</detailed_description>
