	<brief_title>Pilot Study Etanercept ( Enbrel ) Children With Fanconi Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients FA treat blood product ( transfusion ) , injection stimulate white blood cell production , and/or androgen therapy reach advance stage bone marrow failure . Although therapy lead temporary improvement blood count , associate potential serious side effect . Currently , know potential cure bone marrow failure Fanconi Anemia stem cell transplant , usually do late stage bone marrow failure associate significant toxicity . Studies show patient FA sensitive produce unusually high level protein call tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) cause bone marrow cell die . We study whether drug call Etanercept reduces level TNF-α delay prevent progressive bone marrow failure associate FA . Etanercept successfully use child arthritis . Primary Objectives : 1 . To assess toxicity Etanercept ( Enbrel ) child Fanconi Anemia ( FA ) early marrow failure . 2 . To assess efficacy Etanercept ( Enbrel ) improve hematopoiesis ( i.e . peripheral count ) patient FA . Secondary Objectives : 1 ) Correlation biological study measure impact Etanercept ( Enbrel ) Tumor Necrosis Factor - α ( TNF-α ) production . Fanconi anemia ( FA ) autosomal recessive disease characterize progressive bone marrow failure , variable congenital abnormality predisposition malignancy , particularly acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) 1 . Cells FA patient exhibit hypersensitivity alkylating agent mitomycin C diepoxybutane ( DEB ) . Currently , FA diagnose test chromosome breakage lymphocyte stimulation exposure mitomycin C ( MMC ) diepoxybutane ( DEB ) 2 . Chromosome fragility , define increase percentage chromosome break , diagnostic FA3 . Although common form constitutional aplastic anemia uncommon true incidence FA know . A total 754 patient North America DEB confirm diagnosis FA register International Fanconi Anemia registry ( IFAR ) 2001 . The major cause morbidity mortality child FA bone marrow failure occur majority child first second decade life . Attempts culture bone marrow progenitor vitro FA patient demonstrate decreased number myeloid erythroid colony , consistent clinical bone marrow failure . Current treatment FA rely upon hematological support form transfusion advance marrow failure occur . Patients FA respond anti-thymocyte globulin cyclosporine ( typical treatment acquire aplastic anemia ) , 50 % improve androgen preparation , median prolongation life 2 year responder ( 16 year 18 year age death ) although relapse inevitable . Androgen therapy cause significant liver toxicity , virilization risk hepatic adenoma carcinoma . Patients respond modality treat stem cell transplantation , associate toxicity transplant condition regimen , graft-versus-host disease increase risk post transplant malignancy compare patient without FA . Five-year survival match sibling transplant approximately 65 % . After unrelated donor transplant , five-year survival 30 % . The natural history disease one eventual death age 10 20 year progressive marrow failure conversion AML ( approximately 10 % patient ) . Thus clearly need effective early therapy well toxicity profile . Studies animal human subject indicate high level systemic TNF-α increase sensitivity hematopoietic progenitor TNF-α play key role pathogenesis bone marrow failure patient FA . This suggest possible benefit support hematopoiesis anti-TNF-α receptor Fc fusion protein ( Etanercept ; Enbrel ) child FA . This study propose treat patient FA early marrow failure Etanercept ( Enbrel ) , medication use treat rheumatoid arthritis . The result propose project use important preclinical data ( see ) support development novel therapeutic approach treatment marrow failure FA . Etanercept ( Enbrel ) prevent progressive marrow failure associate complication without need transplant find effective , treatment include standard clinical care FA patient , potentially many year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must diagnosis FA proven DEB test conduct cytogenetics lab Dr. Arleen Auerbach , Rockefeller University Hospital . 2 . Patients must evidence early marrow failure i.e . reduction least one cell line two separate occasion least one month apart e.g . platelet count &lt; 100,000 per cubic millimeter , hemoglobin &lt; 9 gm/dl and/or absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 1000 3 . Negative pregnancy test ( conduct via serum βHCG screen ) do first dose study drug woman ( except surgically sterile , least 5 year postmenopausal , age 10 year ) 4 . Sexually active patient childbearing potential must agree use medically acceptable form contraception screen throughout study 5 . Patients designees must ability selfinject investigational product care giver home administer subcutaneous injection 6 . Patients designees must able willing give write informed consent comply requirement study protocol must authorize release use protect health information 7 . Patients must negative TB skin test entry study 1 . Patients &lt; 4 yrs age 2 . Patients advance marrow failure i.e . transfusion dependent , eligible anticipate stem cell depletion already advanced stage . 3 . Patients currently enrol another investigational device drug trial ( ) ( define drug approve FDA ) , receive investigational agent ( ) within 28 day baseline visit exception CCHMC IRB protocol # 03911 , `` Thyroid Hormone Children Fanconi Anemia '' 4 . Patients androgen therapy 5 . Patients receive immunosuppressive agent within last 3 month prior enrollment 6 . Patients grade 3 4 adverse event laboratory toxicity Blood Bone Marrow ( per NCI CTC criterion ) time screen visit time study , opinion Investigator would preclude participation study 7 . Patients active infection within 4 week screening/baseline visit 8 . Patients untreated Lyme disease 9 . Patients recent past history fungal infection 10 . Patients history TB TB exposure , chronic hepatitis B hepatitis C , SLE , history multiple sclerosis , transverse myelitis , optic neuritis epilepsy 11 . Patients know hypersensitivity Etanercept ( Enbrel ) component know antibody Etanercept ( Enbrel ) . 12 . Patients receive hematopoietic growth factor great 3 consecutive day 6 month study enrollment ( i.e. , erythropoietin , filgrastim , neupogen , sargramostin ) clinical purpose improve bone marrow function . Patients receive hematopoietic growth factor stem cell mobilization collection exclude study . 13 . Patients available match sibling donor clinically indicate need bone marrow transplant 14 . Patients renal failure require dialysis 15 . Patients total bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dl and/or SGPT &gt; 200 time enrollment 16 . Patients pregnant breastfeed female risk pregnancy unable practice safe sex length study 17 . Patients HIV positive 18 . Patients severe comorbidities ( diabetes mellitus require insulin , CHF severity , MI , CVA TIA within 3 month screen visit , unstable angina pectoris , uncontrolled hypertension , oxygendependent severe pulmonary disease , history cancer within 5 year ( resect cutaneous basal squamous cell carcinoma situ cervical cancer ) 19 . Patients mycobacterial disease know history immunosuppressing disease 20 . Patients history recent alcohol substance abuse ( &lt; 1 year ) 21 . Patients history noncompliance therapy 22 . Patients condition judge patient 's physician cause clinical trial detrimental patient</criteria>
