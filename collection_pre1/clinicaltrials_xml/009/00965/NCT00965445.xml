	<brief_summary>Oxidative stress unavoidable event cardiac surgery . Isoprostanes demonstrate reliable biomarker evaluation oxidative stress vivo.The aim study ( 1 ) develop accurate liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method detection urinary isoprostane isomer sample collect healthy volunteer ( method quality control ) patient receive cardiac surgery ( 2 ) investigate change isoprostanes cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) ( 3 ) investigate effect different anesthetic isoprostanes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enhanced production oxygen free radical lead generation oxidative stress , harmful human tissue organ . Reactive oxygen specie release abruptly surgical procedure , major cause ischemia-reperfusion injuries.Isoprostanes demonstrate reliable biomarker evaluation oxidative stress vivo . Therefore , accurately monitor avoid occurrence oxidative stress surgery important clinical issue . Isoprostanes series prostaglandin-like compound produce non-enzymatic peroxidation arachidonic acid.The aim study ( 1 ) develop accurate liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method detection urinary isoprostane isomer sample collect patient receive cardiac surgery ( 2 ) investigate change isoprostanes cardiopulmonary bypass ( 3 ) investigate effect different anesthetic isoprostanes surgery .</detailed_description>
