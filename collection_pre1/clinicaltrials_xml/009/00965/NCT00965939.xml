	<brief_summary>CYPTAM-BRUT 2 prospective , multicentric study include postmenopausal woman receive tamoxifen metastatic , locally advanced ( stage IIIB/C ) neoadjuvant set measurable estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer . The primary endpoint difference efficacy tamoxifen , define objective response rate use RECIST criterion , woman normal versus low Tamoxifen Activity Score ( TAS ) 3-6 month tamoxifen use . The TAS score base presence genetic variation drug interaction . Secondary endpoint time progression , clinical benefit , serum metabolite concentration , endometrial change menopausal symptom . Patients use tamoxifen neoadjuvant set need operate 4-6 month follow start tamoxifen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multi-centre open label single arm non randomize observational study compare efficacy term overall response rate progression free survival tamoxifen first line therapy 3 group postmenopausal woman measurable hormone dependent large , locally advanced metastatic breast cancer . The 3 group woman normal low 'tamoxifen activity score ' base genetic polymorphism CYP2D6 gene important metabolism tamoxifen use SEQUENOM 's MassARRAY technology . The study subject Ethical Commission approval patient consent . The study necessitate collection blood genetic analysis . We investigate relation study genotype , use drug interfere tamoxifen tamoxifen-related endpoint like regression metastatic locally advanced large oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer tamoxifen user . The 'tamoxifen activity score ' use group US show link tamoxifen compliance . The score adapt Belgian situation base prevalence polymorphism Belgian population . The efficacy tamoxifen correlate predefined 'tamoxifen activity score ' base presence single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) relevant gene combine effect well know drug interfere metabolism tamoxifen . The study conduct several clinical site Belgium . All patient receive tamoxifen 20mg daily . Patients large operable inoperable non-metastatic breast cancer consider surgery 4 month tamoxifen . If operable , postoperatively receive appropriate adjuvant therapy hormone therapy either continue tamoxifen receive oral aromatase inhibitor decide clinician . If woman locally advance inoperable breast cancer operable 4 month neo-adjuvant therapy , another appropriate salvage therapy propose . Women metastatic breast cancer continue treatment clinical imaging progression unacceptable toxicity development . Patients experience progression disease define RECIST criterion receive salvage therapy oral aromatase inhibitor tamoxifen give first line patient may require another therapy like chemotherapy . The study require approximately 14 month recruit another 7 month events/data analysis estimate time progression set 9-12 month tamoxifen give first line endocrine therapy metastatic setting</detailed_description>
