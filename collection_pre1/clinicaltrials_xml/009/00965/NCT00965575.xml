	<brief_summary>The prevalence epilepsy 1 % USA . About 30 % epilepsy patient eventually become refractory medical treatment . Co morbid condition become important seizure control affect overall wellbeing . Sleep related complaint frequent include , frequent arousal , difficulty fall asleep excessive daytime sleepiness . Polysomnography show increase arousal index , sleep onset latency , stage shift fragment REM sleep . Poor sleep efficiency cause daytime fatigue , poor cognition behavior worsen seizure control . Stabilizing sleep may improve seizure control . Melatonin naturally occur hormone body involve regulation circadian rhythm exogenously give , show decrease sleep onset latency , arousal , there-by increase sleep efficiency healthy pediatric patient . Similar data exist patient epilepsy . As sleep important impact epilepsy overall functioning , important study effect melatonin child epilepsy . We propose randomize double blind placebo control trial cross-over design . Our hypothesis , patient epilepsy , administration melatonin 30 minute bedtime four week may : - Improve quality sleep ; - Improve daytime functioning term cognition , behavior quality life ; - Decrease epileptic potential . We use polysomnography , electroencephalogram , psychomotor vigilance task , seizure diary , questionnaires assess effect melatonin domains . This study may help improve care child epilepsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Melatonin Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis 1 : Melatonin treatment improve quality sleep patient epilepsy . Various study evaluate sleep problem patient epilepsy use questionnaire show 34-45 % patient sleep related problem [ 1-3 ] . Cortesi et al report child seizures high sleep difficulty sibling control [ 4 ] . Bedtime difficulty , sleep fragmentation , daytime sleepiness , snore parasomnia report sleep problem population [ 2 , 4 ] . Patients refractory seizure use multiple antiepileptic drug ( AED ) show bad problem [ 5 ] . On polysomnography ( PSG ) patient show increase arousal index , increase sleep onset latency , fragment reduce REM sleep , increased stage shift increase Stage 1 sleep decrease stage 2 slow wave sleep . [ 6-9 ] Melatonin show decrease sleep onset latency increase total sleep time subjectively improve sleep healthy individuals. [ 10-15 ] . Various study use fast release sustain release formulation suggest improvement sleep efficiency decrease arousal well . [ 16-18 ] In randomized placebo control study Gupta et al [ 19 ] , Melatonin show subjectively improve sleep patient epilepsy . Studies child neurodevelopmental delay autism along epilepsy also report similar finding . [ 17 , 20-23 ] Rationale : There significant sleep disturbance child epilepsy . Melatonin show improve sleep group patient . However , study report improvement base parent report one study placebo-controlled . Our study assess randomize placebo control fashion provide subjective objective improvement sleep primary outcome improve sleep efficiency PSG . Hypothesis 2 : Melatonin improve daytime functioning term cognition , behavior quality life patient epilepsy . Poor sleep epilepsy detrimental effect cognition . [ 24-27 ] Melatonin improve sleep may improve cognitive functioning patient . Some patient epilepsy poor behavior psychiatric function . [ 28-30 ] Severity problem related worsen sleep problem . [ 2 , 4 ] Melatonin improve sleep may improve behavior patient . Epilepsy negative effect various aspect patient ' life include social , behavioral , academic [ 31 , 32 ] . Questionnaires developed assess impact overall quality life patient [ 33 , 34 ] . These tool helpful quickly subjectively assess quality life . Based study , show patient refractory seizure poor quality life [ 33-37 ] improvement see seizure frequency decrease . [ 38-41 ] There one study reporting quality life ( QOL ) use melatonin patient epilepsy . In randomized placebo control study , significant improvement see cognitive , anxiety behavior subscales QOLCE use melatonin . [ 42 ] To date , study report effect melatonin cognition behavior epilepsy patient . Rationale : Poor behavior , cognition quality life report child epilepsy sleep disturbance . By improve quality sleep , melatonin improve domain . QOLCE validate used epilepsy patient assess QOL patient . Vigilance component cognition consistently drastically affected sleep deprivation . PVT measure `` vigilant attention '' use widely adult patient assess effect sleep deprivation cognition . It describe sensitive measure see acute chronic effect sleep deprivation . BASC-PRS use assess behavior child find equally useful epilepsy patient child behavior check list ( CBCL ) . It sensitive tool compare change short time span . Hypothesis 3 : Melatonin treatment decrease epileptic potential . Sleep deprivation know induce seizure epileptic discharge EEG [ 43 ] . Seizures also know occur change depth rhythmicity sleep . [ 43 ] Patients epilepsy report sleep deprivation significant seizure precipitate factor [ 44 , 45 ] . In recent study , Haut et al report one hour additional sleep precede night decrease relative odds seizure subsequent day 0.91 [ 46 ] . In study Oliveira report treatment obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) decrease interictal epileptiform discharge . [ 47 ] The belief few epileptiform discharge represent good seizure control controversial . But study suggest decrease epileptiform discharge EEG improve behavior . [ 48 ] Studies investigate obstructive sleep apnea patient epilepsy report improvement seizure control treatment OSA [ 49-54 ] . These suggest stabilize sleep beneficial effect seizure control . Many study evaluate melatonin epilepsy patient report overall improvement seizure control [ 17 , 21 ] , others report worsen seizure control use melatonin [ 20 , 22 , 23 ] . Coppola et al report inconclusive result regard seizure control melatonin use [ 55 ] . However , study power account variability seizure occurrence report epilepsy patient . Rationale : There randomize control study available evaluate effect melatonin seizure control child epilepsy . This study identify effect short term use melatonin compare placebo provide pilot data evaluate effect large trial future .</detailed_description>
