	<brief_summary>Background : - Cisplatin-containing chemotherapy standard care advance thymoma thymic carcinoma treat surgery . New option treatment necessary patient advance thymoma thymic carcinoma progress cisplatin-containing therapy . - IMC-A12 new ( experimental ) agent yet approve Food Drug Administration . IMC-A12 block Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) . IGF-1R find many type cancer cell , include cancer thymus , think play important role help cell grow divide . Objectives : - To determine IMC-A12 effect tumor growth patient cancer thymus . - To evaluate safety tolerability IMC-A12 treatment cancer thymus . Eligibility : - Individuals older 18 year age cancer thymus ( thymoma , thymic carcinoma , thymic carcinoid tumor ) progress spite standard treatment . Design : - Treatment take place 21-day cycle . Patients receive one dose IMC-A12 intravenously every 3 week Clinical Center . During Clinical Center visit , researcher perform study test procedure see study drug affect body . - Patients undergo number test procedures treatment cycle , include physical examination , blood urine sample standard test , image study ( ultrasound , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan ) evaluate tumor growth , blood urine sample evaluate amount IMC-A12 body . - Patients may continue take drug long adverse side effect long tumor grow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Cisplatin-containing chemotherapy standard care advance unresectable thymoma thymic carcinoma . New option treatment necessary patient advance thymoma thymic carcinoma progress cisplatin-containing therapy . The insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) pathway study various malignancy include thymoma thymic carcinoma . IMCA12 anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody show activity patient thymic malignancy . Objectives : - To determine objective response rate ( partial response ( PR ) +complete response ( CR ) ) IMC-A12 monotherapy patient advance recurrent thymoma thymic carcinoma . - To evaluate time response , duration response , progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) - To assess safety IMC-A12 - To perform immunohistochemistry IGF1R expression tumor sample thymoma thymic carcinoma ( exploratory ) - To correlate response therapy change fludeoxyglucose 18F-positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) image baseline first restaging - To perform pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analysis IMC-A12 - To perform pharmacodynamic ( PD ) analysis blood detection IGF1R , AKT pAKT peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC 's ) ( exploratory ) . - To assess circulate endothelial cell , circulate endothelial progenitor cell , immune subset analysis glucose transport peripheral blood monocyte lymphocyte ( exploratory ) . - To evaluate anti-cytokine antibody peripheral blood ( exploratory ) . Eligibility : - Patients histologically confirm thymic carcinoma thymoma previously treat least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen - Measurable disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria - Adequate renal , hepatic hematopoietic function - No major surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy biologic therapy within 28 day IMC-A12 therapy Design : - Patients receive IMC-A12 dose 20 mg/kg intravenously every three week - Treatment IMC-A12 alone continue disease progression - Toxicity assess every cycle Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) Version 3.0 December 31 , 2010 , CTCAE Version 4.0 begin January 1 , 2011 - Tumor response assessment RECIST 1.0 criterion perform every 2 cycle - Correlative study include tissue immunohistochemistry study do exist tumor block - Blood sample collect PK 's , PD 's , circulate endothelial cell ( CEC 's ) , circulate endothelial precursor cell ( CEPC 's ) , immune subset , glucose transport cytokine antibody .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Histologically confirmation invasive recurrent metastatic thymoma thymic carcinoma pathology department / Center Cancer Research ( CCR ) / National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , pathology department participate institution . Patients must least one prior platinumcontaining chemotherapy regimen . There limit number prior chemotherapy regimens receive . Progressive disease document entry study . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) great 20 mm conventional technique great 10 mm spiral CT scan . See section 11 evaluation measurable disease . Target lesion select within previously irradiate area , newly arise clearly progress irradiation proven repeat scan . Patients must recover toxicity relate prior therapy least grade 1 ( define CTCAE 3.0 December 31 , 2010 , CTCAE 4.0 begin January 1 , 2011 ) must major surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy , biologic therapy ( include investigational agent ) , hormonal therapy ( replacement ) , within 4 week prior enter study . Concurrent corticosteroid myasthenia gravis , paraneoplastic syndrome often accompany thymic malignancy allow . Inhaled steroid also allow . However since steroid might occasionally induce response thymic malignancy patient stable dose steroid great equal 8 week enrollment order confound efficacy assessment . Age great 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use IMCA12 patient less 16 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric phase 1 singleagent trial . Life expectancy great 3 month . Performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) less equal 2 . Patients must adequate organ marrow function ( define ) . Patients must return baseline grade 1 acute toxicity relate prior therapy : leukocyte great equal 3,000/mm^3 absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mm^3 hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL platelet great equal 100,000/mm^3 total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ( SGOT ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ( SGPT ) less equal 3 time institutional ULN ( 5x LFT elevation due liver metastasis ) creatinine less equal 1.5 time institutional ULN OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Patients may transfuse obtain hemoglobin 9.0 . The patient must fast serum glucose le 120 mg/dL institutional ULN The effect IMCA12 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study therapy 3 month last dose IMCA12 . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability comply intravenous administration schedule , ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES : Both men woman member race ethnic group eligible trial . Every effort make recruit woman minority study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients symptomatic brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . However , patient treatment brain metastasis whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable least 3 month without steroid may enrol discretion principal investigator . Patients poorly control diabetes mellitus . Patients history diabetes mellitus allow participate , provide blood glucose within normal range ( fast less 120 mg/dL institutional upper limit normal ) stable dietary therapeutic regimen condition . Uncontrolled medical illness include , limited , ongoing uncontrolled , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( American Heart Association ( AHA ) Class II worse ) , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Human Immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient poorly control viral load ( viral load great 50 copy HIV/ml ) , and/or AIDSdefining illness exclude due possibility IMCA12 may worsen condition likelihood underlying condition may obscure attribution adverse event respect IMCA12 . HIV positive patient thymic malignancy meet criterion consider inclusion study . Patients may receive investigational agent . History another invasive malignancy last five year . Adequately treated noninvasive , nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ carcinoma cervix , surgicallyremoved papillary thyroid cancer allow . Prior treatment drug IGF1R inhibitor class . Patients tumor amenable potentially curative therapy assess investigator . Pregnant woman exclude study IMCA12 monoclonal antibody IGF1R potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . IgG antibody may also potentially secrete milk therefore breastfeeding woman exclude . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition IMCA12 .</criteria>
