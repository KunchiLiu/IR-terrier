	<brief_summary>An increase number Veterans anticipate develop chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) require hemodialysis ( HD ) treatment Veteran population age . In 2003 , approximately 290,000 US citizen receive HD estimate 19 million affected CKD . The annual growth rate predict 7 % per year 500,000 Americans receive HD treatment 2010 . In 2005 , approximately 2500 Veterans receive HD growth expect parallel see general population . Whereas Alzheimer 's disease lead cause dementia general population , grow evidence suggest patient advanced CKD experience cognitive deficit relate accelerate cerebrovascular disease . Patients advance CKD show high prevalence sub-clinical cerebrovascular damage image study heavy burden vascular risk factor diabetes , elevate cholesterol , hypertension . Many cognitive deficit relate cerebrovascular disease may go unrecognized routine measure cognition . HD patient increase number hospitalization , several compliance issue range congestive heart failure dangerous electrolyte imbalance . Impaired cognition population likely significant impact self-care compliance complex medical regimen . Currently , severity scope cognitive impairment relate vascular disease well know patient advance kidney disease . Additionally , relationship cognitive impairment measure self-care independence well know . Loss independence function secondary impair cognitive function likely significant problem patient advance kidney disease . Early identification functional impairment , particularly instrumental activity daily live ( IADL ) , allow rehabilitation intervention . Maintaining improve functional independence intensive rehabilitation could translate good compliance low hospitalization rate among HD patient . Information obtain study likely heighten awareness cognitive impairment functional consequence Veterans advance kidney disease . Primary objective determine : 1 . The range cognitive deficit emphasis domain affect vascular disease patient advance CKD receive hemodialysis . 2 . The association severity cognitive impairment severity kidney disease . 3 . The prevalence impair IADLs level health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) patient advance CKD require hemodialysis . 4 . The relationship association cognitive impairment IADL HRQOL . Secondary objective determine : 1 . The relationship among cerebral carotid blood flow , carotid artery stiffness , renal specific metabolic abnormality cognitive impairment .</brief_summary>
