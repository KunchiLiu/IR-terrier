	<detailed_description>3-Hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl ( HMG ) coenzyme A-reductase inhibitor ( statin ) establish role treatment hypercholesterolemia . Their efficacy reduce cardiovascular morbidity mortality secondary primary prevention demonstrate large prospective trial . HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor inhibit competitively rate-limiting enzyme endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis . As consequence , intracellular pool free cholesterol decrease low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptors up-regulated , lead increase receptor-mediated clearance LDL plasma . This mechanism responsible large proportion cholesterol-lowering effect . However , statin-induced decrease lipoprotein production also propose mechanism lipid-lowering effect . The underlying mechanism vivo , however , would mediate effect , fully understood . Except pronounced cholesterol-lowering property , statin also modest effect ( 15 20 % ) decrease triglyceride concentration . In subject high intra-abdominal fat store , increase flux free fatty acid liver produce increase rate hepatic triglyceride synthesis , turn lead increase low-density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) production , since latter partly determine intracellular availability triglyceride . This also find subject type 2 diabetes mellitus number study show pathophysiologic state statin able decrease lipoprotein production . Interestingly , obese individual show statin increase catabolism apoB-100-containing lipoproteins alter rate production secretion . In present study focus subject near normal body weight ( mean body mass index 25 +- 3 kg/m2 ) normal serum triglyceride concentration investigate , fast state , whether statin influence hepatic lipoprotein production . Since recent evidence suggest supply cholesterol available incorporation nascent lipoprotein particle also exert regulatory influence apoB secretion liver , investigate addition acute inhibitory effect high bolus dose simvastatin order stimulate LDL receptor expression maximum degree . The main goal present study determine influence simvastatin apoB-100 appearance rate lipoprotein kinetics fast non-obese subject moderate hypercholesterolemia . For purpose , subject investigate three turnover protocol : without treatment , chronic simvastatin treatment standard dosage , chronic simvastatin treatment additional acute-on-chronic high bolus dose simvastatin .</detailed_description>
