	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) age-related degenerative disorder brain , characterize progressive decline cognitive function ability perform activity daily live , ultimately lead death due complication disease . AD think cause excess A-Beta amyloid , sticky protein brain form amyloid plaque . Treatments slow synthesis deposition A-Beta amyloid , increase clearance , might expect slow progression AD . LY2062430 ( solanezumab ) humanize anti-A Beta peptide immunoglobulin G-1 ( IgG1 ) monoclonal antibody develop treatment AD . The primary hypothesis test LY2062430 slow cognitive functional decline AD compare placebo . Each patient 's participation last approximately 19 month . Patients take approved AD medication may participate study continue take medication study .</brief_summary>
