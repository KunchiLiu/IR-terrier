Dilating lesion involve branch vessel associate risk closure side branch . Plaque redistribution 'plaque shift ' across carina bifurcation regard responsible mechanism side branch stenosis occlusion angioplasty stenting . Modern technique side branch protection require position second wire side branch start treatment main branch . Placing additional wire side branch laborious complex wiring main branch , associate additional use contrast medium radiation , may associate additional risk complication . Being able determine side branch require wire protection treat main vessel stenosis may make procedure simpler safer . Lipid core plaque ( LCP ) coronary artery common acute coronary syndrome , often find also patient stable angina . Lipid core plaque detect angiography intra-vascular ultrasound . Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) ability identify chemical mixture . LipiScan , catheter base NIRS coronary imaging system detect intra-vascular LCP . This catheter show able identify LCP blood prospective autopsy study , LCP detection algorithm develop validated ex vivo data applicable vivo . The image generate system call 'chemogram ' . The catheter also test successfully clinical study United States Canada . Based study FDA approve use LipiScan coronary imaging system . In CUMC , start use catheter identify LCP , gain experience simple use . This study intend pilot study identify angioplasty relate redistribution shift lipid core plaque ( LCP ) lesion locate site artery bifurcation . We hypothesize angioplasty stenting , soft plaque contains lipid core may prone shift ( hard ) fibrotic calcified lesion . This pilot study may help good characterize lesion likely shift provide imaging-based information like NIRS improve interventional treatment bifurcation lesion . A total 20 patient significant coronary artery disease bifurcation lesion suitable angioplasty stenting study . The lesion study contain significant stenosis ( ≥50 % stenosis ) locate proximity ( le 2 mm ) side branch . Prior angioplasty , main vessel involve bifurcation image use LipiScan Coronary Imaging System . Angioplasty stenting perform usual conventional way , re-imaged LipiScan system . Intravascular ultrasound do standard interventional imaging procedure , direct treat interventional cardiologist . Angiographic Chemographic data qualitatively quantitatively analyzed ass LCP plaque shift side branch . Subjects intravascular ultrasound part routine care , data analyze compare chemogram data . Improved understanding plaque lipid core redistribute condition redistribution occurs could assist interventional cardiologist well plan perform complex procedure involve bifurcation plaque . Improved procedural planning prediction shift reduce instance difficult side branch rescue reduce occurrence peri-procedural event , myocardial infarction . This may turn lead reduction overall complexity treatment procedure , complication , procedure recovery time . The catheter-based interventional treatment branch point block heart blood vessel complex prone high rate complication . This study intend well understand condition coronary blockage move balloon angioplasty stenting . The movement coronary artery blockages standard treatment coronary disease often lead block small artery branch near treatment site . The block small branch occur time , occur often result small myocardial infarction residual chest pain . All patient study undergo standard cardiac catheterization intervention direct treat physician . In research , researcher analyze image data collect procedure . This include angiography ( patient ) , intravascular ultrasound ( patient operator determines need use part procedure ) , image LipiScan catheter ( patient ) . The LipiScan catheter approve FDA intravascular detection fat blood vessel , use detect fat composition blockage . This catheter , detect whether blockage compose fat soft , fibrous hard . In study go try identify type blockage associate branch point , learn whether soft fat contain blockage associate shift movement blockage material side branch . The information learn study may help interventional cardiologist future good plan interventional technique strategy perform safe successful procedure . Coronary artery bifurcation ( branch area ) predispose atherosclerosis turbulent flow increase shear stress . Lesions situate bifurcation segment account 16 % interventional procedure ( 1 ) . Stenoses bifurcation remain one technically challenge lesion subset treat coronary angioplasty stenting ( 2- 5 ) . Dilating lesion involve branch vessel associate risk stenosis complete closure side branch . In past , bifurcation lesion consider contraindication PTCA due significantly increase risk side-branch occlusion . In various series , rate side branch stenosis occlusion post angioplasty stenting range 9-67 % ( 6-11 ) threaten side branch . Salvage occlude side-branch may difficult , unsuccessful around 50 % rescue , especially ostium side branch contain stenosis prior occlusion ( 12 , 13 ) . In case , side branch occlude , may severely narrow , mainly plaque shift . Over year , improve experience , technique , technology , common practice treat bifurcation lesion percutaneously , high success acceptable complication rate . Nevertheless bifurcation lesion pose high technical demand use interventional device . Using IVUS imaging , plaque redistribution describe stenting ( 14 , 15 ) . Plaque redistribution 'plaque shift ' across carina bifurcation regard responsible mechanism compromise side branch lumen . Other predictor side branch occlusion include significant branch-ostial stenosis , main vessel dissection , acute coronary syndrome include acute MI ( 16 ) . The later important situation may combination thrombus top lipid contain plaque . Modern technique side branch protection entail position second wire side branch start treatment main branch ( 1,16 , 17 ) . The decision protect side branch depend estimate risk closure treat main branch . Unfortunately , impossible predict whether specific side branch compromise . Advancing additional wire side branch laborious complex wiring main branch , mandate use large caliber guide catheter , prolongs overall procedure time , associate large volume contrast medium x-ray radiation , may associate increase risk complication like coronary dissection , perforation , bleed contrast induce nephropathy ( 1 ) . The ability identify side branch need wire protected work main vessel make procedure simpler safer .</detailed_description>
