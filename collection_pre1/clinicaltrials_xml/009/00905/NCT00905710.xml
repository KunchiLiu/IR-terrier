	<detailed_description>Lynch syndrome ( LS ) , hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC ) , autosomally dominantly inherit disorder account 1-2 % colorectal cancer case . LS cause germline genomic alteration one mismatch repair ( MMR ) gene hMLH1 , hMSH2 , hMSH6 hPMS2 . The lifetime incidence colorectal cancer 20-75 % mutation carrier . Individuals LS-associated colorectal cancer differ sporadic disease several way : tumour diagnose earlier age ; majority tumour locate proximal colon ; increase risk develop synchronous metachronous colorectal cancer prognosis relatively favourable compare sporadic case . It generally accept LS associate colorectal cancer develop along adenoma-carcinoma sequence sporadic case . There evidence suggest adenoma-carcinoma sequence accelerate LS patient compare general population . Colonoscopic screen subsequent removal polyp 3-year interval asymptomatic at-risk member LS family show reduce incidence colorectal cancer improve overall survival . However , within interval surveillance program , interval cancer observe . It therefore currently recommend MMR gene mutation carrier keep surveillance regular colonoscopy every 1-2 year begin age 20-25 5-10 year young early affected family member . LS adenomas predominantly locate proximal colon frequently carry villous architecture high-grade dysplasia , marker associate increase risk develop colorectal cancer . Even LS adenomas small 5-7 mm size , high-grade dysplasia encounter . Therefore , identification high-risk precursor lesion LS consider paramount importance . It known conventional colonoscopy certain miss rate colorectal neoplasm , especially small adenoma . A year ago , technique chromoendoscopy introduce . Chromoendoscopy , one various dye spray onto colonic mucosa via spray catheter pass work channel endoscope , offer detailed evaluation mucosal surface . Indigo carmine contrast stain absorb react surface mucosa . In 2 large randomise controlled trial chromoendoscopy significantly increase detection small adenomas proximal colon compare conventional colonoscopy . Recently , 2 trial LS patient reveal chromoscopic endoscopy improve detection adenoma , particularly flat lesion , compare conventional colonoscopy . Together , data suggest chromoendoscopy may improve detection rate significant neoplastic colonic lesion LS patient . However , true value chromoendoscopy management LS patient remain demonstrated . The aim study determine whether chromoendoscopy , include polypectomy detect lesion , reduces development colorectal neoplasia need colectomy LS patient follow-up endoscopy . The result study indicate value chromoendoscopy management LS patient whether technique implement current surveillance procedure .</detailed_description>
