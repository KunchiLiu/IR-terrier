	<detailed_description>General description : The overall study procedure require assessment eligibility safety inclusion study ( `` screen questionnaire '' `` health screen visit '' ) eligible , one day study visit ( `` Study visit '' ) . Screening questionnaire All subject , whether interview clinic visit call response flier , give pre-screening questionnaire . This give people voluntarily express interest study . Participants disclose condition would exclude participate invited health screen visit . Health screen visit The purpose pre-study health screen perform detail assessment provide screening questionnaire determine potential subject eligible participate study . A member research team first read consent form subject , describe health screen study visit , answer question subject regard nature study and/or study procedure . The screen visit consist follow : - Reading sign study consent . The subject give copy consent . - Collection information demographic current past health history . - Ascertain participant medical history participant interview review his/her medical record - A physical exam , include measure record vital sign ( temperature , blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate ) , height , weight ( documented medical record past 3 month ) . - Collection blood sample laboratory test , require , describe Table 4 . - Pre-menopausal woman child-bearing potential undergo serum pregnancy test , use small amount blood sample collect . - Ascertainment current recent past medication . If subject patient Tufts Medical Center , research team member may access potential participant 's medical record subject sign consent form screen potential exclusion criterion , ascertain laboratory test result necessary determine eligibility , confirm medical history provide potential participant medication list . If participant patient Tufts Medical Center , research team member obtain permission obtain participant 's medical record his/her physician . For non-pregnant woman childbearing age ( pre-menopausal ) sexually active , use acceptable birth control method require participation . They request sign statement compliance prior participate study state employ one below-listed form contraception screen study visit . - condom spermicide - diaphragm spermicide - injectable contraceptive ( Depoprovera ) - transdermal contraceptive ( Ortho-Evra Nuvaring ) - intrauterine device ( IUD ) - permanent sterilization ( i.e . tubal ligation , vasectomy , Essure ) - abstinence sexual activity - hysterectomy - oral contraceptive If study visit occur 1 week health screening , female subject undergo second , urine-based pregnancy test morning study visit . Given small dose iohexol administer study visit , rapidly filter kidney , continue use birth control follow completion study visit require . If potential subject take trimethoprim contain medication cimetidine. , study physician discus attend physician whether safe person stop medication one week prior study . If , person exclude participation . If potential subject take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent medication block renin-angiotension system , study physician discus potential participant attend physician whether maintenance stable dose medication possible . If change subject 's medication regimen require immediately prior study visit , subject reschedule later date . Eligibility determine principal investigator physician co-investigators base medical history obtain participant , medical record result laboratory test include medical record obtain health screen visit ) . Eligible subject contact see remain interested participate study . A study visit date schedule . All subject receive stipend health screening ( see Section G.8 ) . Preparation study visit : A urine jug detail set instruction complete 24 hour urine collection mail subject . Subjects take medication interfere creatinine whose physician approve temporary discontinuation medication remind phone call study coordinator stop medication 1 week prior study visit time . Subjects also ask take multivitamin calcium supplement day study undigested tablet may interfere quality DEXA scan . A research team member contact subject telephone 2-3 day visit ensure subject fully understands instruction complete urine collection cease take medication interfere creatinine . The research team member request subject diabetes bring medication , administration device ( e.g . insulin syrinx control delivery device ) , personal blood sugar monitoring device ( i.e . glucometers ) day study visit . A research team member order iohexol pharmacy . Study visit : Non-diabetic subject request fast overnight avoid change non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent medication block renin-angiotension system . Subjects diabetes ask eat light breakfast morning study visit . Subjects ask maintain adequate oral hydration ingest two three glass non-caffeinated beverage prior arrival morning study visit facilitate time urine collection study visit . If subject feel he/she unable void upon arrival , he/she give 2 3 additional non-caffeinated beverage give approximately 1 beverage every hour remainder study visit . The 24 hour urine collect previous day participant give research team member upon arrival study . If participant forgets collect 24 h urine midst collection , intra-study time urine collection utilized analysis . If participant forgotten container home , arrangement make collect container within next 2 day . The nursing staff measure record subject 's height , weight , blood pressure , temperature , pulse rate , respiration rate , confirm subject experience change physical/psychological health since screening . The timed urine collection begin participant first urge void . The nursing staff record time first void participant ask collect urine void remainder study visit collection container . To facilitate complete bladder emptying , participant give glass ( approximately 6 ounce ) non-caffeinated beverage every hour end study visit . As outline , three week elapse since health screening , woman childbearing age administer urine pregnancy test use aliquot intra-study time urine collection . Subjects diabetes ask check blood sugar equipment nurse staff CTRC use CTRC 's equipment . The study physician inform low high blood sugar . A saline lock and/or intravenous line insert two different site baseline blood separate sample tissue banking ( 10 mL , optional ) collect . After take baseline blood , 5 mL iohexol ( Omnipaque 300 ; 300 mg/mL organic iodine ) administer nurse Clinical Translational Research Center ( CTRC ) period approximately 15 second IV port , follow flush approximately 10 mL 0.9 % normal saline solution . This intravenous line iohexol administer remove . The syringe weight near tenth gram scale injection . Blood sample plasma clearance measurement obtain second IV line , remain place throughout course study visit . To maintain patency IV access , normal saline administer rate approximately 20-30 c.c . per hour 500 c.c . bag normal saline . The administration iohexol consider time 0 . Following iohexol administration , blood sample take approximately 10 , 30 , 120 , 240 minute second intravenous line . For participant estimate GFR le 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 , determine screen visit subject 's medical record , sample drawn 360 minute . The exact time sample record . After 30 minute blood sample , participant feed breakfast consist standardized protein content . They also receive lunch similar protein content . Subjects diabetes give meal consistent treatment regimen . Subjects ask administer medication check blood sugar level course study visit would normally , manner prescribe treat physician . If subject CTRC past 6 PM , he/she also receive dinner . The Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan may schedule prior start GFR measurement follow entire GFR visit time best participant DEXA scan . It may perform separate day . Prior scan , subject ask remove metal object ( e.g . belt , earring , jewelry , etc ) . Subjects may request void prior initiating scan . During scan , subject ask lie flat table approximately 5-10 minute scan take place . Participants free move around GFR test . At conclusion GFR test , second intravenous line remove . Subjects remain CTRC least 30 minute follow removal IV line . During time , nursing staff re-measure record subject 's vital sign ( height , weight , blood pressure , temperature , pulse rate , respiration rate ) . The participant ask void prior leave CTRC ensure complete urine collection study visit . The nurse record stop time urine collection . Upon successful completion study visit , subject receive stipend .</detailed_description>
