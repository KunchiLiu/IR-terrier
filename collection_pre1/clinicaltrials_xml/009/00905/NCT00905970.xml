	<brief_summary>It traditionally consider development Latent Tuberculosis Infection ( LTBI ) due M. tuberculosis ability develop dormancy state within well-structured lesion ( granuloma ) , remain lung host even life . A new original hypothesis develop Experimental Tuberculosis Unit base scientific evidence take account idea lesion hold forever , host tends remove lesion order rebuild original parenchyma , heal process . Even M. tuberculosis remain dormant/non-replicating state long period , important sufficient factor explain LTBI . The Dynamic Hypothesis try explain existence LTBI spite heal process could remove constant reinfection host 's tissue . While `` Static '' view defend induction active TB reactivation bacillus old lesion ; `` Dynamic '' view want demonstrate constant induction new granuloma . In case one new lesion take place upper lobe privilege zone , possibility induce cavity would appear , develop active Tuberculosis ( TB ) .</brief_summary>
