	<brief_title>Impact Myfortic Gastrointestinal ( GI ) Prophylaxis Maintenance Renal Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GI prophylaxis common post kidney transplant routinely use patient receive variety different immunosuppressive regimen . Cellcept prednisone often big concern GI distress GI ulcer . Routine use GI prophylaxis medication post-transplant potentially one mental obstacle transplant clinician fully persuade GI neutral effect myfortic immunosuppressive regimen . Patients receive myfortic ( part conversion US02 study ) theoretically reduce risk GI upset development GI ulcer . These patient ideal candidate discontinue GI prophylaxis medication take myfortic .</detailed_description>
