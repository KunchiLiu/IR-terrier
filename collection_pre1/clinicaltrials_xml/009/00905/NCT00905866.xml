	<detailed_description>Either primary secondary hyperparathyroidism may necessitate parathyroidectomy patient improve related biochemical abnormality symptom , .

The well-known pentad symptom - painful bone , kidney stone , abdominal groan , psychic moan , fatigue overtone - common , although patient dramatic symptom . The multifactorial cause many symptom patient make difficult know extent surgical intervention alleviate symptom . Several endocrine surgeon western country use standardized health status assessment tool SF-36 ( Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey ) ass symptom health state patient hyperparathyroidism . Results study confirm patient indeed impaired several domain even seemingly `` asymptomatic '' patient benefit parathyroidectomy . More recently , Canadian surgeon Pasieka design validate disease-specific surgical outcome tool , parathyroidectomy assessment symptom ( PAS ) score , patient hyperparathyroidism . Using tool , several study different country show study group patient hyperparathyroidism significantly symptoms control , symptom remarkably ameliorate surgery . In Taiwan , small number study evaluate neuropsychiatric function neuromuscular abnormality patient . None study use patient-based measure health status quality life intend capture patient-reported perception health function .</detailed_description>
