	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vitamin E may help prevent development cancer . Studying sample tissue patient colorectal cancer receive Vitamin E undergo surgery laboratory may help doctor learn Vitamin E change biomarkers related colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomize early phase I trial study give vitamin E supplement see affect biomarkers patient undergo surgery colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine effect high γ-tocopherol vitamin E mixture supplementation plasma level α- , γ- , δ-tocopherols , prostaglandin E_2 patient plan undergo surgery colorectal cancer compare blood sample collect supplementation group analyze level tocopherol metabolite urine sample . - Test hypothesis supplementation reduces oxidative nitrosative stress measure plasma level F_2-isoprostane , C-reactive protein , 3-nitrotyrosine well urinary level 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) . - Determine level α- , γ- , δ-tocopherols colon tissue analyze immunohistochemically cell proliferation , apoptosis , β-catenin localization , RXR expression , cyclooxygenase-2 , 8-OHdG , 3-nitrotyrosine level colon cancer tissue slide . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . The first 5 patient receive supplement ( establish laboratory standard ) , patient randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive intervention undergoing plan surgery . - Arm II : Patients receive oral high γ-tocopherol vitamin E mixture supplementation daily 1 week undergoing plan surgery . - Arm III : Patients receive oral high γ-tocopherol vitamin E mixture supplementation daily 2 week undergo plan surgery . Blood urine sample collect baseline day surgery tocopherol biomarker analysis . A sample colon tissue remove standard surgical resection chemical analysis . Plasma , tumor tissue , nontumorous tissue analyze level F_2-isoprostane , 8-OHdG , 3-nitrotyrosine , prostaglandin E_2 via enzyme immunoassay level α- , γ- , δ-tocopherols via HPLC .</detailed_description>
