	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn safety Haemophilus ( H. ) influenzae , ability produce adverse reaction live nose throat . The nose throat healthy adult populate specific type H. influenzae Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHi ) 2019 Streptomycin Resistant ( StrR ) number 1 . Researchers study whether germ settle nose throat , whether cause symptom place nose , long germ last nose throat , whether body try produce permanent defense germ . Volunteers receive low dose ( 3,200 germ ) high dose ( 32,000 germ ) . Active participation last 28 day , include 3 night hospital stay , additional follow-up visit , follow 6 month follow-up phone call . Study procedure include blood sample , saliva sample , several nose wash throat swab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Haemophilus ( H. ) influenzae continue major human pathogen cause upper low respiratory tract diseases range otitis medium sinusitis invasive pneumonia . The inoculation nasal droplet propose trial introduce organism nasal mucosa , natural host tissue H. influenzae colonization . It hypothesize inoculum elicit typical nasal colonization see healthy individual . To develop colonization model , healthy adult devoid chronic medical condition might predispose subject invasive disease , enrol . This study link Division Microbiology Infectious Diseases ( DMID ) protocol 04-022 . Final safety reactogenicity data DMID 04-022 , collate . This nasal colonization model evaluate 15 volunteer determine model safe individual identify human colonize dose ( HCD ) 50 HCD 90 . However , confidence interval HCD dose broad . The goal study characterize safety trial refine HCD 50 90 dos . This study single-site , randomize blind study design develop colonization model Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHi ) . Ten healthy young adult age 18-54 enrol inoculate either 3,200 colony form unit ( CFU ) 32,000 CFU NTHi strain 2019 Streptomycin Resistant ( StrR ) number 1 follow nasal wash throat swab determine whether colonization NTHi 2019 StrR number 1 develops . Subjects meet enrollment criterion admit inpatient clinical research unit private room stay day 0 thru morning day 3 ( visit 2-5 ) evaluate reactogenicity nasal inoculation . During hospital stay , subject remain respiratory isolation . On day 0 , five volunteer inoculate low dose , 3,200 CFU , five inoculate high dose , 32,000 CFU . After inoculation , primary volunteer follow daily 6 day ( visits 2-8 , day 0-6 ) clinical assessment culture . Days 4-6 , inoculated volunteer return daily basis review reactogenicity parameter , solicitation adverse event ( AEs ) , target physical exam pharyngeal swab nasal wash specimen obtain . On day 6 , visit 8 , pharyngeal swab nasal wash sample collect woman child bear potential urine pregnancy test perform , inoculated volunteer receive 3 day levofloxacin eradicate potential colonizing study organism . Participants return day 14 28 ass AEs , target physical exam perform pharyngeal swab , nasal wash , blood saliva collect . A telephone visit perform 6 month inoculation . A substudy perform evaluate whether casual contact serve mechanism transmission NTHi 2019 StrR number 1 colonize individual casual contact . Three 10 subject recruit substudy . They spend 3-5 hour per day 6 day subject nonintimate contact follow nasal wash throat swab determine whether colonization NTHi 2019 StrR develop . The primary objective study evaluate safety reactogenicity NTHi Strain 2019 StrR number 1 administer nasal drop inoculation . The secondary objective : evaluate frequency duration colonization NTHi strain 2019 StrR number 1 establish human colonize dose 5</detailed_description>
