	<brief_title>Exemestane With Sunitinib ( SUTENT® ) Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design phase II design . Eligible patient undergo stag work start treatment . Every 28-day period ( 4 week ) count cycle . Medical evaluation perform every 4 week stag work repeat every 12 week . The primary objective study assess progression free survival ( PFS ) treatment exemestane sunitinib post¬menopausal subject hormone receptor positive ( ER-positive and/or PR-positive ) unresectable locally advanced metastatic breast cancer subject progress prior hormonal treatment . In addition want : 1 . Obtain assessment overall response rate ( ORR ) , clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) , overall survival ( OS ) . 2 . Determine safety tolerability combination regimen . 3 . Study molecular change tissue biopsy , circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) , circulate endothelial cell ( CECs ) , explore association treatment response resistance . 1 . Blood sample draw enumeration profile circulate tumor cell circulate endothelial cell study entry ( prior start study medication ) , four week start study medication , twelve week start study medication disease progression . These sample strongly encourage patient may decline without impact eligibility continuation study . 2 . If patient participate study easily accessible breast mass metastatic lesion ( e.g . lymphadenopathy , skin metastasis , chest wall metastasis ) , core needle punch biopsy obtain study entry ( prior start study medication ) , four week start study medication , disease progression . These biopsy strongly encourage patient may decline without impact eligibility continuation study .</detailed_description>
