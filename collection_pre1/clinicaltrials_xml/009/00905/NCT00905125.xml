Subjects encouraged take temperature around time day . Subjects phone call Day 2 review memory aid , concomitant medication assessment , assessment AEs . Subjects phone call Day 8 AE assessment , concomitant medication assessment review memory aid . At approximately Day 28 vaccination , subject return clinic immunogenicity blood sample collection , concomitant medication assessment , assessment AEs . A targeted physical exam conduct , indicate . At approximately Day 180 6 month vaccination , subject phone call assessment serious adverse event ( SAEs ) . Unsolicited non-serious AE data capture Day 0 Day 28 .
