	<brief_title>A Study Treat Patients With Edentulous Mandibles With Two Straumann 3.3mm Diameter Bone Level Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial compare crestal bone level change , soft tissue parameter , implant success survival small diameter implant edentulous mandible restore removable overdentures . An initial patient evaluation conduct determine wether patient meet study inclusion exclusion criterion . The edentulous subject undergo surgery placement two dental implant , test control implant . The implant place intraforaminal region . A gingival former insert implant implant placement ensure transmucosal heal . After 6 8 week heal abutment retrieve locator abutment connect implant . The removable prosthesis prepare connected implant two week later . The study blind 12 month post surgery complete unblinded follow period 3 year . Straumann deliver randomization envelop site create independent Clinical Research Organization ( CRO ) . The randomization envelop mark sequential number . The master randomization list keep Straumann . The success survival implant , soft tissue condition , success prosthesis part product safety assess 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 month surgery . Source data verification perform qualified study monitor assess accuracy , completeness , representativeness registry data compare data external data source . Data record standardized Case Report Forms study subject inform consent obtain . The investigator responsible accuracy data enter Case Report Forms . All source document pertain study maintain investigator make available inspection authorize person . Sample size calculation proceed give range clinical relevant difference test control implant give range standard deviation two side pair t-test significance level 0.05 power 80 percent . To robust deviation assumption normality take account possible dropout good clinical practice increase calculate sample size 10 20 percent . To detect clinical relevant difference 0.1 standard deviation 0.3 , one need 73 plus 15 ( 88 ) patient study . Management dropouts miss data depend frequency particular outcome measure . Any adjustment describe completely . All data include analysis . If outlier determine exist , additional analysis exclude outlier may perform rationale exclusion describe completely . A first data analysis include data 12 month surgery plan patient complete respective study period . Inferential statistical analysis stage restrict primary efficacy parameter . The final data analysis perform patient complete study . Categorical data describe contingency table frequency percentage , whereby dominator percentage define number patient respective analysis set . Continuous data summarise mean , standard deviation , minimum , 1st quartile , median , 3rd quartile maximum . Also number miss nonmissing value give . Tables present device type total , appropriate . Preabutment connection value serve baseline value . Hypothesis test carry two side significance level 5 percent , except primary efficacy analysis . The confirmatory noninferiority test perform one side 2.5 percent significance level . As usual secondary , adjustment o significance level multiple testing perform . In case unacceptable deviation statistical model assumption , transformation data , use different distributional model nonparametric approach consider . All statistical calculation analysis perform use Statistical Analysis System ( SAS ) version 9.1.13 high .</detailed_description>
