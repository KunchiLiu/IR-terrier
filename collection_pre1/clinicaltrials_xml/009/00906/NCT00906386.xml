	<detailed_description>1 . PURPOSE : The purpose placebo control study determine efficacy , safety , gender difference use varenicline smoking cessation population stable methadone maintenance patient treat Opioid Dependence . 2 . HYPOTHESIS : 1.Stable methadone maintenance patient receive varenicline likely maintain abstinence patient receive placebo 2.There difference type number symptom report stable methadone maintenance patient receive varenicline placebo 3.There change methadone dosage abstinent non-abstinent smoker 4.There difference efficacy , withdrawal symptom , safety varenicline male female participant 3 . JUSTIFICATION : Patients methadone maintenance treatment smoke prevalence rate 80-90 % consequently disproportionately high mortality compare general population . A majority patient express desire quit generally heavily dependent nicotine . Randomized controlled trial non-drug use population show varenicline efficacious smoke cessation placebo smoke cessation medication . This placebo control research protocol examine varenicline 's effect smoking cessation/reduction potential sex gender difference population methadone maintain patient . 4 . OBJECTIVES : Primary outcome : - Continuous abstinence smoking last 4 week treatment ( week 9-12 ) . Secondary outcome : - 7-day point prevalence abstinence - Continuous abstinence Weeks 9-26 - Sex gender difference - Psychological assessment ( Beck Depression Inventory ) - Adverse effect ( Nausea , Dry mouth , Flatulence , Constipation , Insomnia , -Abnormal dream , Irritability , Sleep disorder , Headaches , Dizziness e.t.c . ) 5 .

The intervention include use Varenicline titrate 1 mg twice daily placebo 12 week , plus weekly brief smoke cessation counseling . 6 . All significance test 2-tailed overall level significance = 0.05 . The primary outcome analysis continuous abstinence use logistic regression model . The secondary outcome : 1. analysis 7-day abstinence 9-26 week continuous abstinence use logistic regression analysis . 2 . Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale , Beck 's Depression Inventory , change methadone dose outcome use repeat measure analysis , 3 . Chi-square test t-tests ( Mann-Whitney U ) determine sex gender difference ( male v female ) well difference adverse effect treatment ( varenicline v placebo )</detailed_description>
