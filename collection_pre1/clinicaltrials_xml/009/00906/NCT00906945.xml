	<brief_summary>This study design test combination Plerixafor G-CSF chemosensitization patient relapse refractory AML .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemosensitization With Plerixafor Plus G-CSF Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , seek target leukemia microenvironment overcome disease resistance . We hypothesize disrupt interaction leukemic blast bone marrow microenvironment , may sensitize leukemic blast effect cytotoxic chemotherapy . In study , seek maximize blockage SDF-1/CXCR4 axis follow : 1 . Addition G-CSF , regulate SDF-1 expression act synergistically plerixafor stem cell mobilization 2 . Intravenous instead subcutaneous dose plerixafor improve kinetics administration . 3 . Dose escalation plerixafor twice daily dose maintain maximum CXCR4 blockade .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Acute myeloid leukemia diagnose WHO criteria one following : Primary refractory disease follow 2 cycle induction chemotherapy First relapse prior unsuccessful salvage chemotherapy 2 . Age 18 70 year old 3 . ECOG performance status ≤ 3 4 . Adequate organ function define : Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min AST , ALT , total bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN except opinion treat physician due direct involvement leukemia ( eg . hepatic infiltration biliary obstruction due leukemia ) Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40 % MUGA scan echocardiogram 5 . Are surgically biologically sterile willing practice acceptable birth control , follow : Females child bear potential must agree abstain sexual activity use medically approve contraceptive measure/regimen 3 month treatment period . Women child bear potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test time enrollment . Acceptable method birth control include oral contraceptive , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , transdermal/implanted injected contraceptive abstinence . Males must agree abstain sexual activity agree utilize medically approve contraception method 3 month treatment period 6 . Able provide sign informed consent prior registration study 1 . Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( AML ( 15 ; 17 ) ( q22 ; q11 ) variant ) 2 . Peripheral blood blast count ≥ 20 x 103 /mm3 3 . Active CNS involvement leukemia 4 . Previous treatment MEC regimen contain mitoxantrone etoposide 5 . Pregnant nursing 6 . Received investigational agent cytotoxic chemotherapy ( exclude hydroxyurea ) within precede 2 week 7 . Received colony stimulate factor filgrastim sargramostim within 1 week pegfilgrastim within 2 week study 8 . Severe concurrent illness would limit compliance study requirement</criteria>
