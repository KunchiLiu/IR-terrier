	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate performance safety intravenous blood glucose ( IVBG ) System relative point care ( POC ) meter performance method compare Yellow Springs Instrument ( YSI ) various condition operate room ( OR ) , ICU general ward ( GW ) subject undergoing elective non-emergent surgery well subject admitted medical/surgical ICU . POC meter system currently use hospital environment measure blood glucose value . The YSI accept reference standard assess POC meter accuracy . The secondary objective study evaluate performance IVBG System compare YSI various condition operate room ( OR ) , intensive care unit ( ICU ) general ward ( GW ) subject undergoing elective non-emergent surgery well subject admitted medical/surgical ICU .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects glucose value collect IVBG System compare pair plasma glucose measurement obtain use theYSI comparative blood sample collect CVC , arterial line peripheral vein . - Blood sample collect per time point : approximately 2ml waste and1mL glucose measurement . In event close blood drawing system utilized , waste would reduce eliminate . - The comparative blood sample draw manually maximum frequency every four hour . - Sample draw exceed 23 per subject duration study . This include 18 comparative blood sample 5 calibration sample draw need ( e.g . recalibration ) . Including partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) draw described section 3.1.2 , would approximately 100 mL 6.8 tablespoon draw per subject . In case close blood drawing system use consistently , would approximately 50 mL 3.4 tablespoon per subject . POC meter blood glucose measurement perform time blood sample draw describe .</detailed_description>
