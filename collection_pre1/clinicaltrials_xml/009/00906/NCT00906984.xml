	<brief_summary>The purpose protocol provide TheraSphere treatment patient liver cancer treat surgery . The effect tumor side effect TheraSphere treatment examine . This study provide supervise limited access TheraSphere treatment University California Irvine Medical Center . TheraSphere medical device contain yttrium-90 ( Y-90 ) , radioactive material use previously treatment liver tumor . When Y-90 incorporate tiny glass bead ( TheraSphere ) , inject liver blood vessel supply liver . This allow large dose radiation deliver tumor less risk toxic effect radiation part body healthy liver tissue . The radiation TheraSphere contain within body become minimally active within 7 day treatment due physical decay . The glass bead remain body , cause health problem . TheraSphere approve use treatment liver cancer United States Food Drug Administration limit basis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TheraSphere® Treatment Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol provide TheraSphere treatment patient liver cancer treat surgery . Patients hepatocellular carcinoma evaluate eligibility treatment follow : physical examination , medical history , blood test require approximately 2 tablespoon blood , EKG , CT MR chest examine lung , CT magnetic resonance ( MR ) abdomen evaluate liver , stomach intestine , bone scan rule spread disease bone . If eligible initial screening , patient proceed second stage screening , include hepatic angiogram confirm treatment provide safely highlight blood vessel supply liver , nuclear medicine study ( Tc-99m MAA scan ) display blood flow lung , stomach intestine . When determined treatment deliver safely , patient receive TheraSphere via hepatic artery blood vessel supply liver outpatient basis .</detailed_description>

The cancer must unresectable . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status Score 0 2 Age ≥ 18 year . Able comprehend read study information sheet accordance institutional federal guideline . Any pretreatment laboratory finding within 15 day treatment demonstrating : Absolute granulocyte count ≤ 1,500/ul Platelet count ≤ 75,000/μl Serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dl Serum bilirubin ≥ 2.0 mg/dl Any follow contraindication angiography selective visceral catheterization : History severe allergy intolerance contrast medium , narcotic , sedative , atropine Bleeding diathesis , correctable usual form therapy Severe peripheral vascular disease would preclude catheterization . Portal hypertension portal venous shunt away liver . Evidence potential delivery great 16.5 millicurie ( mCi ) ( 30 Gy absorb dose ) radiation lung either : 1 ) first TheraSphere administration ; 2 ) cumulative delivery radiation lung &gt; 30 Gy multiple treatment . Evidence detectable Tc99m MAA flow stomach duodenum , application establish angiographic technique stop flow . Significant extrahepatic disease represent imminent lifethreatening outcome . Severe liver dysfunction pulmonary insufficiency . Active uncontrolled infection . Significant underlying medical psychiatric illness . Pregnant woman may participate .</criteria>
