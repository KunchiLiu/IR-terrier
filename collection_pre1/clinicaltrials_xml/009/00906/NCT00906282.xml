	<brief_summary>The purpose multi-center Phase II trial examine impact pemetrexed/carboplatin preoperative treatment patient select stage IB , II , III non-squamous NSCLC . Because patient non-squamous type NSCLC show well survival rate patient squamous tumor give pemetrexed platinum agent , patient non-squamous NSCLC ( adenocarcinoma , large cell , undifferentiated ) , include squamous histology , allow participate study . If novel regimen prove safe active setting , provide rationale investigation large , prospective , randomized trial .</brief_summary>
