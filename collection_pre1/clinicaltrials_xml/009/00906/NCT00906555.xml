	<brief_summary>Adequacy solute clearance make profound impact clinical outcome maintenance hemodialysis patient . Thus far , guideline target solute clearance ( Kt/V URR ) base patient three dialysis session per week . However , quite patient dialysis session twice per week China . The dialysis target solute clearance population remain elucidate . The aim study explore optimum target solute clearance ( Kt/V URR ) maintenance hemodialysis patient two dialysis session per week . Two group hemodialysis patient different Kt/V ( 1.2 ≤ Kt/V ＜ 1.7 versus Kt/V ≥ 1.7 ) follow 96 week prospective , randomize , multi-center , interventional study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Different Dosages Solute Clearance Outcome Twice Weekly Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , multi-center intervention study . 400 maintenance hemodialysis patient twice dialysis session per week enrol study . All patient baseline Kt/V 1.2 1.7 ( 1.2 ≤ Kt/V ＜ 1.7 ) . After treatment intervention , patient randomize two group accord different Kt/V ( 1.2 ≤ Kt/V ＜ 1.7 vs. Kt/V ≥ 1.7 ) , patient regularly follow baseline , 12 week , 24 week , 48 week , 72 week 96 week . Clinical outcome mortality , complication life quality two group investigate .</detailed_description>
