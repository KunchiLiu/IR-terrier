	<brief_title>Clinical Pharmacology Study AZD7295 Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine pharmacokinetic profile oral dos AZD7295 capsule administer healthy subject - To study effect food pharmacokinetic profile oral dos AZD7295 capsule healthy subject - To assess safety tolerability profile oral daily dos AZD7295 capsule healthy subject TYPE AND DESIGN : Part A A phase I , single-centre , double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled , crossover , food effect study healthy subject Part B A phase I , single-centre , double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled , ascend dose study healthy subject NUMBER OF SUBJECTS : 16 subject take part total 4 treatment period . SUBJECT CHARACTERISTICS : Healthy male females non-child bear potential age 18 65 year . Recruitment balance gender variable . TREATMENT : Part A Subjects randomise receive AZD7295 placebo ( 14 active ; 2 placebo ) either feed fast state accord treatment allocation : Treatment A : 260 mg ( 4 x 65 mg ) AZD7295 capsule placebo dose fed state Treatment B : 260 mg ( 4 x 65 mg ) AZD7295 capsule placebo dose fasted state Following dose first two period period interim analysis , pharmacokinetic data review order determine whether remain treatment dose either feed fasted state . Subjects Part A continue Part B study . Part B Subjects allocate two group n=8 ( Group 1 Group 2 ) randomise receive AZD7295 placebo ( 6 active ; 2 placebo ) . Subjects receive two ascend dose treatment follow order accord group allocation : Group 1 : Treatment C : 455 mg ( 7 x 65 mg ) AZD7295 placebo dose either feed fasted state ; Group 2 : Treatment D : 650 mg ( 10 x 65 mg ) AZD7295 placebo dose either feed fasted state ; Group 1 : Treatment E : 650 mg ( 10 x 65 mg ) AZD7295 placebo , twice day ( q12h ) dose either feed fast state ( total administer dose : 1300 mg ) ; Group 2 : Treatment F : 650 mg ( 10 x 65 mg ) AZD7295 placebo , three time day ( q8h ) dose either feed fast state ( total administer dose : 1950 mg ) . Safety data limit PK data review data review group prior proceed next dose level . During dose escalation phase maximum 4 subject dose per day . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome determine pharmacokinetic profile AZD7295 dose fed fast state ass safety tolerability high daily dos AZD7295 . GENERAL SCHEDULE : Screening plan start April 2009 , clinical phase due complete end July 2009</detailed_description>
