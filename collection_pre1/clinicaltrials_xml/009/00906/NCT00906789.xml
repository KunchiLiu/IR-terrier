	<detailed_description>In 2000 , data present FDA demonstrate new system computer analysis could assist radiologist detection small lung cancer chest radiograph . Radiologists use system show statistically significant improvement lung cancer detection rate use system , compare interpretation chest radiograph use computer system . This study , along support data , result FDA give Pre-Market Approval system . The system undergone several improvement software hardware , intend test two different software system determine whether radiologist use system improve detection lung cancer chest radiograph . One system process chest radiograph decrease emphasis give shadow rib thereby enhance ability radiologist detect disease lung . The second system performs series evaluation chest radiograph , base complex system analysis , point location chest radiograph contain solitary pulmonary nodule characteristic primary lung cancer solitary metastasis cancer lung . This test radiologists determine degree improvement , , result interpret chest radiograph may may cancer , first interpret without computer , second , image output software .</detailed_description>
