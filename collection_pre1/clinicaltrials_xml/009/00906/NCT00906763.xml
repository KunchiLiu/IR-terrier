	<brief_summary>Chocolate consumption long associate enjoyment pleasure . Popular claim confer chocolate property stimulant , relaxant , euphoriant antidepressant . These possible pharmacological action might relate various biogenic amine , serotonin , dopamine , tyramine , histamine , phenylethylamine cannabinoid-like substance . Most amine metabolize monoamineoxidase-A ( MAO-A ) therefore unable pas blood-brain-barrier . In contrast , phenylethylamine direct dopamine release ingredient substrate MAO-B due lipophilic structure even capable pas blood-brain-barrier . Within line , clinical observation suggest increased chocolate consumption patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) compare healthy subject pre-disease state . In previous study , assess consumption chocolate non-chocolate sweet PD patient partner ( household control ) use self-questionnaire . Consumption chocolate significantly high PD patient compare control , consumption non-chocolate sweet similar group . Our study suggest chocolate consumption increase PD independent concomitant depressive symptom measure BDI-1 . Although reason increase chocolate consumption PD remain elusive , may hypothetically consequence high content various biogenic amine content cocoa influence dopamine metabolism . Therefore , present study aim study effect dark chocolate high cocoa content ( 85 % ) compare chocolate without cocoa ( white chocolate ) motor symptom PD patient measure UPDRS part III ( motor score ) . The principle design intervention similar standard pharmacological challenge test study effect motor symptom PD ( e.g . levodopa challenge test ) .</brief_summary>
