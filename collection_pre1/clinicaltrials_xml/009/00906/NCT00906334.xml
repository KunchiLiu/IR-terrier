	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety ON 01910.Na Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) Patients With Trisomy 8 Classified Intermediate-1 , -2 High Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2 , study 14 MDS patient Trisomy 8 classify Intermediate-1 , -2 High risk meet inclusion/exclusion criterion receive ON 01910.Na 800 mg/m^2/24h continuous intravenous infusion ( CIV ) 48 hour week 3 week 4-week cycle . As Amendment 3 Protocol , regimen change 1800 mg/24h 72 hour every week first four 2-week cycle every 4 week afterwards . The total study duration 31 week , include 2-week screening phase , 27-week dosing phase , 4-week follow-up phase begin last dose ON 01910.Na . Beginning week 4 , every 2 week thereafter , patient assess response . Patients drop reason replace . Patients achieve week 29 complete partial response stabilization disease eligible receive additional 24 week ON 01910.Na 1800 mg/24 h 72 hour per week 4-week cycle .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis MDS confirm within 2 week prior study entry accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) Criteria FrenchAmericanBritish ( FAB ) Classification . Trisomy 8 cytogenetics ( simple combine karyotype ) patient classify Intermediate1 bone marrow blast equal great 5 % , Intermediate2 High Risk MDS accord IPSS score , Patients peripheral blood blast equal great 5 % . At least one cytopenia ( Absolute Neutrophil Count &lt; 1800/µl Platelet Count &lt; 100,000/µl Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL ) . Failure , insufficient response Azacytidine Decitabine administer 4 6 cycle patient classify Intermediate2 High risk Erythrocyte stimulating agent ( failure insufficient response define transfusion dependence Hemoglobin remain 10 g/dl ) Low Intermediate1 Risk Trisomy 8 patient . Failed respond , relapse following , opted participate bone marrow transplantation . Off treatment MDS ( include filgrastim ( GCSF ) erythropoietin ) least four week . As exception , filgrastim ( GCSF ) use , protocol treatment patient document febrile neutropenia ( &lt; 500/µl ) . ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 2 . Willing adhere prohibition restriction specify protocol . Patient ( his/her legally authorize representative ) must sign informed consent document indicate he/she understands purpose procedure require study willing participate study . Anemia due factor MDS ( include hemolysis gastrointestinal bleeding ) . Hypoplastic MDS ( cellularity &lt; 10 % ) . Any active malignancy within past year except basal cell squamous cell skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix breast . History HIV1 seropositivity . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris cardiac arrhythmia . Active infection adequately respond appropriate therapy . Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 mg/dL relate hemolysis Gilbert 's disease , ALT AST &gt; 2 X ULN . Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2 . Ascites require active medical management include paracentesis , hyponatremia ( define serum sodium value &lt; 134 Meq/L ) . Women patient pregnant lactating ; Male patient female sexual partner unwilling follow strict contraception requirement describe protocol ; Patients agree use adequate contraceptive [ include prescription oral contraceptive ( birth control pill ) , contraceptive injection , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , doublebarrier method ( spermicidal jelly foam condom diaphragm ) , contraceptive patch , surgical sterilization ] entry throughout study ; Female patient reproductive potential negative serum betaHCG pregnancy test screening . Major surgery without full recovery major surgery within 3 week ON 01910.Na treatment start . Uncontrolled hypertension ( define systolic pressure equal great 160 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure equal great 110 mmHg ) . New onset seizure ( within 3 month prior first dose ON 01910.Na ) poorly control seizures Any concurrent investigational agent chemotherapy , radiotherapy immunotherapy . Treatment standard MDS therapy investigational therapy within 4 week start ON 01910.Na . Psychiatric illness/social situation would limit patient 's ability tolerate and/or comply study requirement .</criteria>
