	<brief_summary>Bradmer Pharmaceuticals , Inc. ( Bradmer ) request approval study safety Neuradiab® combine Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) therapy give minimum 30 day Neuradiab administration patient first second recurrence glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , attempt manage life threaten recurrence Grade IV malignant glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuradiab® Combined With Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) Therapy Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present satisfactory therapy patient recurrent GBM practitioner leave best effort combination therapy disease . At present number chemotherapeutic agent , include nitrosoureas , carboplatin , bevacizumab , etoposide , irinotecan , imatinib , use salvage therapy either alone combination . Additional trial variety agent underway , preliminary result single-agent study disappoint . Currently , nitrosoureas ( lomustine carmustine ) , include Gliadel® Wafer ( carmustine ) adjunct surgery , approve use previously treat GBM . At present treatment recurrent disease available agent result median survival range 22-44 week . The historical data previous human exposure Neuradiab highly suggestive benefit patient survival . Since Neuradiab® show promising efficacy patient recurrent disease acceptable risk-benefit ratio , since substantial survival benefit currently available agent use treat patient population , Neuradiab® propose experimental alternative recurrent GBM patient Single-Center Phase II Trial . Recurrent GBM serious immediately life-threatening disease , comparable satisfactory alternative drug therapy available treat stage disease . Overall , survival data indicate need effective treatment recurrent GBM .</detailed_description>
