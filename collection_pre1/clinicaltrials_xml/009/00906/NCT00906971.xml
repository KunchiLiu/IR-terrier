	<brief_title>Physiotherapeutic Intervention Children With Chronic Functional Constipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 ) INTRODUCTION Chronic functional constipation ( CFC ) common problem pediatric population , affect approximately 25 % seek specialized medical care . The complaint multifactorial , involve environmental , psychological physiological factor , interact brain-gut axis , retention stool secondary pain-restraint cycle , associate fear anxiety result bowel movement , important development management CFC . Difficulties involve management CFC common . Conventional treatment include educational measure , disimpaction , laxative increase fiber intake . However , measure necessarily beneficial case , cure ratio 50 60 % , around one third patient become long-term sufferer constipation . The muscle intestine contribute atonic constipation - sluggish flaccid muscle bowel rectum , spasticity - increased muscle tone due emotional stress . These two factor present patient CFC . Bowel movement depend interlinked function abdominal muscle , pelvic floor diaphragmatic breathing : contraction diaphragm , abdominal distention result voluntary relaxation abdominal wall pelvic floor lead increase intra-abdominal peristaltic pressure relaxation external anal sphincter ( EAS ) , thus culminate bowel movement . Added , activity parasympathetic autonomic nervous system cause increase gastrointestinal motility relaxation sphincter . The superficial deep abdominal muscle , addition diaphragm muscle pelvic floor , form single muscle unit assist regular bowel movement , work together order stimulate peristalsis . Therefore , combination exercise stimulate relax abdominal muscle , indirectly act pelvic floor , coordinate diaphragmatic breathing , may trigger contraction intestinal rectal muscle , therefore bring relief patient CFC . Multidisciplinary treatment complement conventional treatment CFC . Physiotherapy exercise abdominal muscle diaphragm plus abdominal massage may reverse change bring CFC . Retraining intestinal function bring due two main effect : 1. mechanical - stimulate colonic movement , improve coordination muscle involve bowel movement , thus encouraging fecal propulsion increase abdominal muscle tone ; 2. neurological - parasympathetic stimulation increase muscle motility , sympathetic stimulation reduces anxiety , promote relaxation increase endogenous serotonin , thus reduce discomfort increase sense well-being . However , little evidence physiotherapy exercise apply patient CFC available literature , randomize , control clinical trial need . The aim present study assess effect muscular training , abdominal massage diaphragmatic breathing patient CFC . The hypothesis exercise train abdominal muscle , diaphragmatic breathing pattern abdominal massage increase frequency bowel movement reduce episode fecal incontinence patient CFC . 2 ) METHODS Design overview A randomized , control trial conduct two parallel group . In physiotherapy group , physiotherapy exercise employ ( isometric training abdominal muscle , diaphragmatic breathing exercise abdominal massage ) together conventional treatment ( disimpaction , necessary , high-fiber diet , laxatives toilet training ) . Patients medication group submit conventional treatment . Disimpaction conduct phosphate saline solution ( day , one five day , accord patient need ) . During toilet training , patient instruct sit toilet least five minute , support foot , three main meal day . Setting participant The trial carry Pediatric Unit Hospital das Clínicas Federal University Pernambuco ( UFPE ) , provide patient tertiary health care . Children adolescent age 4 18 year take part study . For inclusion study , patient consider CFC present two follow parameter basal period , least week , previous two-month period , accord Rome III criterion : two less bowel movement per week , least one episode fecal incontinence per week , report retentive behavior , episodes hard stool pain bowel movement , presence large quantity stool rectum large diameter stool , could obstruct toilet . Exclusion criteria patient take medication cause constipation , patient organic cause child cognitive problem perform protocol . Children age four six year assessed ability complete physiotherapy exercise . This assessment consist repetition protocol conduct shorter complete form , difficulty complete protocol exercise consider non-inclusion criterion , interfere result . Parents guardians sign term inform consent receive information aim procedure study . A specially structure form apply regard sign symptom CFC . The study approve Ethics Committee Research involve human being Centro Integrado de Saúde Amaury de Medeiros ( Registration 085/08 ) . Randomization interventions A table random number create computer someone involve study , determine random distribution sequence patient . This information remain exclusive knowledge one research assistant , use number allocate patient order study entry , immediately give consent take part . This make known researcher statistical analysis . - Physiotherapy + medication group ( Intervention ) Physiotherapy exercise conduct one single generalist physiotherapist , specially trained perform exercise three month prior study . Twelve individual session hold twice week , last forty minute , adherence confirm patient attend twelve session . A one-minute rest period observe series exercise . - Isometric training abdominal muscle The aim training increase intra-abdominal pressure ( compress intestine ) colonic propulsive force voluntary effort . Considering indirect synergic activation pelvic floor muscle lower abdominal muscle , operation voluntary isometric contraction upper abdomen simultaneous relaxation lower abdomen improve muscle coordination , relaxation pelvic floor relaxation external anal sphincter , thus optimize bowel movement . This consist contraction upper abdomen muscle diaphragm simultaneous relaxation lower abdomen , supervision physiotherapist . Training carry two manner : patient lie leave lateral decubitus position hip knee flexed 90º sit . In lie method , train begin two series eight contraction relaxation , third week , increase two series twelve contraction relaxation , remain sixth week . In sit method , train begin one series three contraction relaxation last ten second , increase five repetition third week , remain sixth week . The exercise consider successfully carry protrusion lower abdomen visible , indicate simultaneous relaxation lower abdomen pelvic floor , point series initiate . - Breathing exercise The aim achieve regular pattern abdominal breathing strengthen abdominal muscle , improve coordination breathing , abdominal anal muscle colonic propulsion . Standard diaphragmatic breathing achieve modify exercise , supervision physiotherapist , patient seat position , one hand place abdomen thorax , instruct breath slowly , deeply progressively 6 8 second , retain air 10 second exhale slowly 6 8 second . Two series complete , ten repetition , exercise consider successfully perform great mobility hand place abdomen achieves , compare minimal mobility hand thorax , point series initiate . - Abdominal massage The aim perform propulsive abdominal massage promote colonic rectal motility , train intestinal function bowel movement . The physiotherapist perform slow circular clockwise movement , along line colon , apply constant moderate pressure abdomen regular tennis ball , remain point one minute , begin ascend colon move direction sigmoid colon . - Medication guidance Patients use laxative ( magnesium hydroxide ) , dosage vary accord individual need ( minimum 2 ml/kg ) , receive guidance regard fiber-rich food , water toilet training . Patients attend weekly consultation pediatric gastroenterologist , unaware patient belong treatment group , since patient receive clinical follow-up . - Medication Group ( Control ) Patients group monitor weekly basis pediatric gastroenterologist , unaware patient belong treatment group , since patient receive clinical follow-up . All patient prescribe laxative ( magnesium hydroxide ) , dosage vary accord individual need ( minimum 2 ml/kg ) , receive guidance regard fiber-rich food , water toilet training , condition patient intervention group . Sample size Since similar study , sample calculate study instruct child achieve bowel movement sit toilet . A reduction encounter 80 % fecal incontinence intervention group 55 % control group . The effect reduction fecal incontinence ( &lt; one/week ) estimate 25 % favor intervention . Epi-Info 6.04 employ , use p=5 % power=80 % , result 72 participant . Outcomes follow-up The frequency bowel movement retentive fecal incontinence primary outcome measure . Pain increase effort bowel movement , consistency stool retentive behavior secondary outcome measure . During follow-up , parent guardian keep diary describe intestinal habit child . These data check handed weekly research assistant . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis compare two group end follow-up period regard primary secondary outcome measure blind , intention-to-treat , consider loss follow-up treatment failure . In case , end follow-up period , frequency bowel movement fecal incontinence record , well response variable , report begin study . The chi-squared test use proportion Student t-test numerical variation normal distribution ( Bartlett test use verify homogeneity variance ) . The Mann-Whitney test use numerical variable non-normal distribution . Statistical significance set p &lt; 0,05 . All analysis perform use Epi-Info™ , version 6.04d ( CDC - Center Disease Control Prevention , Atlanta , USA WHO World Health Organization , Geneva , swirtzerland ) . An intragroup treatment additional exploratory analysis also conduct assess function retentive behaviour fear bowel movement frequency bowel movement end treatment .</detailed_description>
