	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomise , control , single blind , single center study . The total study duration patient 24 month . Straumann Bone Level Ø 4.1 mm SLActive implant place single tooth replacement , follow either immediate provisional prosthetic loading provisionalised . The final prosthetic loading make 16 week implant loading . The implant length select accord clinical indication site base previous radiographic evaluation . In total 11 visit per patient schedule study . Bone level change , implant success survival rate , soft tissue change , aesthetic outcome adverse event ( AEs ) assess . The study device CE- ( Conformité Européenne , mean European Conformity ) mark product . One center United Kingdom participate .</detailed_description>
