	<brief_summary>The purpose study characterize blood flow plastic tube heart-lung bypass machine heart surgery . Technical specification provide manufacturer consider vary hemodynamic condition temperature hemoglobin level affect blood viscosity ultimately blood flow patient heart-lung bypass . The investigator wish perform prospective study heart-lung bypass tube child require heart-lung bypass heart surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Venous Cannulae Flow Ratings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During bypass , venous drainage essential maintain proper perfusion pediatric patient . The quality venous drainage large impact level care patient provide . This study investigate blood flow velocity right angle venous cannulae utilized bypass . The flow cannulae analyze use doppler flow probe employ Transit Time Technology . This type technology crystal within flow probe send magnetic signal tube purpose determine accurate flow blood . There little evidence identifies actual amount blood flow generate venous cannulae clinical setting . Manufacturers venous cannulae CPB publish flow rating different size cannulae available . These flow rating gather data produce non-clinical lab often inaccurate . Because inaccuracy , selection base experience rather publish clinical data . This study would instrumental determine potential risk benefit patient result amount drainage provide venous cannulae bypass . A sample size 50 patient ( n=50 ) one day old utilized study . The specific venous cannulae size analyze 12Fr , 14Fr , 16Fr , 18Fr , 20Fr , 24Fr , &amp; 28Fr DLP ( DLP Fr type size cannulae , respectively ) right angle cannulae . The doppler flow probe utilized study reusable , non-invasive , clamp-on device measure blood flow CPB tubing . Each patient one flow probe place venous cannulae prior start CPB . Bypass alter anyway . Hemoglobin blood level , blood temperature , pressure venous line record throughout CPB digitally sample via CPB machine ( e.g . blood draw require ) . To examine quality venous drainage , pressure transducer attach venous line measure amount negative pressure generate venous cannulae . The negative pressure line attach venous line stopcock already present CPB circuit . Each cannulae size analyze three time acquire proper amount data need fulfill statistical practical need study . A descriptive analysis continuous categorical data perform use mean , standard deviation , confidence interval , proportion , frequency distribution . Statistical test include parametric non-parametric bi-variate multi-variate technique appropriate variable ' level measurement distribution .</detailed_description>
