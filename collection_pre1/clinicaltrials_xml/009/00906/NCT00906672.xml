	<brief_title>Medico Economic Evaluation Dermal Substitute Integra® Coverage Inferior Limb Traumatic Skin Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic skin loss bone tendon exposure essentially affect inferior limb . There consider serious often lead functional esthetical consequence , generally affect young people . Flap surgery treatment reference skin loss . This technique require expensive material lot medical staff . The intervention duration hospitalisation often long heavy medication . Post surgery complication disable sequelea involve surgical re-interventions increase duration hospital stay medical staff availability . The dermal substitute Integra® ( Integra LifeSciences Corporation ) advance wound care device comprise porous matrix cross-linked bovine tendon collagen glycosaminoglycan semi-permeable polysiloxane ( silicone layer ) . This medical device allow formation neoderm . The silicon layer temporary layer remove neoderm totally build . This surgery fast , non-invasive , short hospital stay limited complication treat easily . Objective study : assess medico-economic interest innovative surgery use dermal substitute Integra® compare reference use flap surgery treatment traumatic skin loss inferior limb . Assessment base re-interventions incidence , long-term functional esthetical scar result total cost technique . Study design : multicenter , randomize , open label , parallel design , clinical trial 12 French plastic surgery / burn care centre . Planned number enrol patient : 120 ( 80 patient receive Integra® 40 patient receive flap surgery ) . Patients randomize 1 2 group , imbalance favour innovative technique . Duration enrollment : 24 month Duration patient follow : 18 month</detailed_description>
