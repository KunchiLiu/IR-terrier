	<brief_title>Self-Guided Depression Treatment Long-Duration Spaceflights : A Continuation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective Depression present significant threat long-duration space mission , crew need ability recognize treat effectively . We develop prototype computer-based system include module recognition treatment depression . Before used astronaut , system need develop test efficacy analog population . The countermeasure develop intend use pre-flight training International Space Station . The program substantial Earth benefit . Aims 1 . Complete development module recognize prevent depression . We complete module , move prototype stage complete computer-based tool . We modify design base data usability acceptability study astronauts NASA Johnson Space Center . We pilot-test module five participant make revision base input . 2 . Develop module implement computer-based Problem-Solving Treatment ( PST ) . Currently , problem-solving treatment do use practitioner guide patient structured therapy follow progress . These practitioner train administer therapy formalized training program incorporate workbook instructional video . These material well suit presentation via multimedia computer make treatment self-guided . The PST intervention modify current video/workbook form computer-based form use astronauts professional suffer depression . 3 . Evaluate efficacy computer-delivered PST module depression randomize , control trial . Hypotheses related aim , compare waiting-list control : - Individuals receive computer-delivered PST show great reduction depression symptom , rat clinician . - Individuals receive computer-delivered PST show great reduction depression , rat self-report . - A great proportion individual receive computer-delivered PST remit post-treatment . Earth-based Applications Research Project Depression widespread , effective treatment available person . This computer-based depression treatment , simple modification revision , could adapt use isolated , operational environment , polar research station , submarine , commercial ship , oil rig underwater research facility . Furthermore , even great value could derive make similar psychosocial support system available public setting primary care practice , public mental health center , school , social service office , place worship , military base , prison , eventually home location , broadband Internet .</detailed_description>
