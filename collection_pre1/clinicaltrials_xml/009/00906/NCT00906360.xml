	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose sunitinib give together cetuximab radiation therapy treat patient locally advanced recurrent squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Sunitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving sunitinib together cetuximab radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety , maximum tolerate dose , dose limit toxicity sunitinib malate administer combination cetuximab radiotherapy patient locally advance , recurrent , second primary poor prognosis , high-risk squamous cell carcinoma head neck . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe toxicity profile regimen . II . To explore tolerability feasibility sunitinib malate administer combination cetuximab radiotherapy patient . III . To assess best overall response rate ( complete partial response ) completion treatment . IV . To assess locoregional control rate . V. To assess distant control rate . VI . To assess pharmacokinetics sunitinib malate deliver percutaneous gastrostomy tube . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study sunitinib malate . Patients receive sunitinib malate orally percutaneous gastrostomy tube daily , cetuximab IV 60-120 minute weekly , undergo concurrent radiotherapy twice daily , 5 day week , 7-9 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients persistent disease undergo surgical resection . *NOTE : *Patients may resection prior enrollment protocol provide high-risk feature recurrence . Some patient undergo blood sample collection baseline periodically study pharmacokinetic analysis sunitinib malate metabolite . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 6 year .</detailed_description>
