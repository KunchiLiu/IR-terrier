	<brief_title>Safety Trial Single Versus Multiple Dose Thymoglobulin Induction Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design confirm one-year safety single-dose rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin induction kidney transplantation , compare conventional administration overall dose divide four small dos across four day . Two randomized group kidney transplant recipient administer drug Thymoglobulin accord different dose regimen . The control group receive usual traditional regimen total 6 mg/Kg divide 4 dos , 1 day transplantation 1 day next 3 day . The experimental group receive total Thymoglobulin dose , 6 mg/Kg , entirely day transplantation . The study double-blinded , placebo dos Thymoglobulin administer need enrollee experimental group . Enrollment target 165 , 150 subject need complete study adequate evaluation .</detailed_description>
