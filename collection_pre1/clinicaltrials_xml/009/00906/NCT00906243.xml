	<brief_summary>This Phase I/IIa open , uncontrolled , prospective study , conduct out-patient setting . The present study one two clinical trial RNActive®-derived vaccine CV9103 conduct concurrently US Europe , represent first clinical trial conduct novel vaccine . The Phase I part study consist stagger inclusion subject two cohort 3 , confirm safety intend dose ( 320 µg RNA per antigen ) , low dose consider case dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) report great equal 2 3-6 subject ; way , recommend dose ( RD ) Phase IIa part study establish . In Phase IIa part study , additional subject include RD , confirm safety explore activity dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RNActive®-Derived Therapeutic Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical Need : At present , curative therapy available subject advance metastatic prostate cancer . Approximately 1 every 3 men present advance metastatic disease ; therefore , current standard therapy ineffective new therapeutic approach warrant . There ample evidence active immunotherapy cancer safe capable stimulate potentially therapeutic immune response cancer patient . Moreover , several Phase II immunotherapy trial suggest clinical benefit reduce tumor mass prolonging time progression subject advanced prostate cancer . Potential Benefits : CV9103 mRNA-based vaccine treatment human prostate cancer base CureVac 's RNActive® technology . CV9103 encode 4 prostate specific antigen . Because antigens present prostate cancer cell , appropriate target intervention . These antigen show correlate frequently progression prostate cancer , know immunogenic human , induce antigen specific T-cell B cell expansion . As RNA-based vaccine , CV9103 feature several advantage approach : highly specific , restriction patient 's MHC genotype , need cross nuclear membrane active . Finally , absence reverse transcriptase , RNA integrate genome . CV9103 administer 5 dos .</detailed_description>
