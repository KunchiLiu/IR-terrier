	<brief_title>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) Ventilation Using Novel Full-Face Mask Versus Conventional Helmet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) delivery ventilatory support without need invasive artificial airway . The use noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation ( NPPV ) acute respiratory failure steadily increase intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient . Noninvasive ventilation often eliminate need intubation tracheostomy preserve normal swallowing , speech , cough mechanism . Discomfort device one reason failure NIV ( 30-40 % case ) . The Novastar oro-nasal mask ( Dräger Medical , Lubeck , Germany ) flexible , transparent mask shell fine silicone gel cushion adapt wearer 's face . The pliable ring embed inside flexible clear shell allow mask bent adjusted fit patient 's face ( customized fit ) , minimize leakage . The mask magnetic , self align clip capture secure fasten mask headgear . The magnetic clip self-aligning . The transparent flexible helmet NIV ( Rüsch 4-Vent , Teleflex Medical Europe , Athlone , Ireland ) fix two strap pass armpit . The brace protect hydrocolloid strip prevent axillary decubitus . It important choose right size helmet avoid air leakages neck region . Two filter in- expiratory way necessary reduce noise . Different device may lead vary degree discomfort , thus , improve compliance . Better tolerability NIV may improve efficacy . Therefore , plan randomize control trial investigate whether different modality NIV delivery may affect therapeutical efficacy . No randomized trial compare helmet NOVASTAR full-face mask . This randomize , control study aim ass whether new full face mask improve gas exchange patient admit ICU acute postoperative respiratory failure . METHODS Patients meet criterion NIV cycle enrol trial . Informed write consent requirement waive Internal Review Board since enrollment criterion meet common clinical guideline two device widely available ( approved indication ) . Enrollment criterion : - Ongoing recent history respiratory failure ( either primary secondary ) - PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg breathing room air PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 300 mmHg receive supplemental oxygen - Acute dyspnea respiratory rate &gt; 25 bpm accessory muscle recruitment and/or paradoxical abdominal breathing Patients exclude : - Refusing NIV - Comatose ( Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 8 ) unable maintain patent airway - Hemodynamically unstable ( systolic blood pressure &lt; 80 mmHg recruitment , receive vasopressors/inotropes ; ongoing angina/myocardial infarction ; newly-developed arrhythmia hemodynamic impact ) - Having recently ( ≤2 week ) undergo oesophageal upper respiratory tract surgery Upon enrolment , patient randomize receive NIV via one two available interface . In group H ( `` helmet '' ) , continuous positive pressure obtain high influx fresh gas ( air + oxygen ) flow high-compliance reservoir , positive end-expiratory pressure valve limit outflow . In M ( `` oral-nasal mask '' ) group flow scheme obtain use T-tube attached mask . Patients ' head elevate 45° group . In group continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) institute 5 cmH2O . Pressure increase increment 2-3 cmH2O maximum 10 cmH2O order reach peripheral blood oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) ≥ 90 % low FiO2 possible . Noninvasive ventilation ideally maintain 24 h. Patients ask wear helmet/mask long possible . During ventilation-free period , maintain short possible , patient receive 50 % oxygen supplementation . The criterion success therapy discontinuation NIV reversal criterion list enrollment . Criteria NIV failure subsequent intubation mechanical ventilation : - Coma ( Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 8 ) inability maintain patent airway - Hemodynamic instability ( systolic blood pressure &lt; 80 mmHg recruitment , receive vasopressors/inotropes ; ongoing angina/myocardial infarction ; newly-developed arrhythmia hemodynamic impact ) - Intolerance interface - Patient 's inability mobilize secretion - PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt; 140 mmHg ≥1 h ventilation MAIN ENDPOINT AND SAMPLE SIZE Arterial blood gas analysis perform upon enrollment , 1 h , 24 h enrollment . The null hypothesis study difference mean PaO2/FiO2 value two group 24 h. We consider clinically statistically significant difference ≥50±60 mmHg group . A total 50 patient enrol . Sample size calculation base assumption 5 % risk type I error 20 % risk type II error , account 10-15 % attrition rate .</detailed_description>
