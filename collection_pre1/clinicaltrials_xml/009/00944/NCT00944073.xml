	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety body 's immune response ( body 's defense disease ) experimental H1N1 influenza vaccine . Up 650 healthy volunteer three age group ( great equal 6 month le 36 month , great equal 36 month 9 year , 10 - 17 year ) history influenza H1N1 2009 influenza infection influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination participate . Participants randomly ( chance ) assign 1 2 possible H1N1 vaccine group . Group 1 receive 15 mcg vaccine ; Group 2 receive 30 mcg vaccine . Participants receive vaccine injection Days 0 21 arm thigh muscle . Study procedures include : medical history , physical exam , maintain memory aid , blood sample collection .

	<detailed_description>Recently , novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus identify significant cause febrile respiratory illness Mexico United States . It rapidly spread many country around world , prompt World Health Organization declare pandemic June 11 , 2009 . Data several cohort different age group receive licensed trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine suggest vaccine unlikely provide protection new virus . Adults likely measurable level serum hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HAI ) neutralize antibody child . These data indicate need develop vaccine new H1N1 strain suggest different vaccine strategy ( e.g. , number dos , need adjuvant ) may appropriate person different age group . Based clinical data novel influenza A virus , high dose , multiple dos unadjuvanted , inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccine may necessary confer protection maximal number vaccine recipient . This protocol explore antibody response follow vaccination 2 different dosage level ( 15 mcg 30 mcg ) 650 child age 6 month 17 year , inclusive . This study assess immune response follow single dose vaccine , ass whether individual pre-existing 'prime ' immunity , initial H1N1 vaccination serve boost , thus confer rapid time protection need few dos . Antibody response assess second dose . This randomized , double-blinded , Phase II study healthy infant , toddler , child , adolescent design investigate safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity inactivate influenza H1N1 virus vaccine . The primary objective safety , assess safety unadjuvanted , inactivate influenza H1N1 vaccine administer 15 mcg 30 mcg dose ; immunogenicity , ass antibody response follow single dose unadjuvanted , inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccine , stratify age recipient , administer 15 mcg 30 mcg dose . The secondary immunogenicity objective ass antibody response follow two dos unadjuvanted , inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccine , stratify age recipient , administer 15 mcg 30 mcg dose . There 3 age stratum , contain 200 subject : great equal 6 month le 36 month , great equal 36 month 9 year , 10 - 17 year . Subjects randomize 2 group , 300 subject per group ( 100 per stratum ) , receive intramuscular inactivate influenza H1N1 vaccine 15 mcg ( Group 1 ) 30 mcg ( Group 2 ) . The vaccine administer Days 0 21 . Following immunization , safety measure assessment adverse event ( AEs ) 21 day follow last vaccination ( Day 42 receive dos Day 21 receive second dose ) ; serious adverse event ( SAEs ) new-onset chronic medical condition 7 month post first vaccination ( Day 201 ) ; reactogenicity vaccines 8 day follow vaccination ( Day 0-7 ) . Immunogenicity test include HAI neutralize antibody test serum obtain day vaccination ( prior vaccination ) 21 day follow second vaccination ( Day 42 ) . For subject age 10-17 year , serum antibody assay also obtain Day 8-10 follow vaccination . However , great equal 6 month - less 36 month great</detailed_description>
