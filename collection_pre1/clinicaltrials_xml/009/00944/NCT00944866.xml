	<brief_summary>The selective cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitor associate increase cardiovascular risk . The goal present study investigate impact COX-2 inhibitor biochemical index cardiovascular disease . As reviewer suggest , investigator propose study effect Cox-II inhibitor use experimentally induce hyperlipidemic rat . Plasma total cholesterol , LDL triglyceride concentration determine animal treat cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitor . Biochemical marker related cardiovascular event include prostaglandin I2 , thromboxaneA2 others also investigate . The investigator also investigate biochemical marker patient take Celecoxib NSAIDs . The investigator hope study reveal clinically useful biochemical marker cardiovascular event patient take Cox-II inhibitor .</brief_summary>
