	<brief_title>Closing Loop Adults With Type 1 Diabetes - Alcohol Consumption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People type 1 diabetes need regular insulin injection continuous delivery insulin use insulin pump . Keeping blood sugar normal range know reduce risk long term complication involve eye , kidney heart . However , achieve treatment goal difficult tight try control blood glucose level , great risk person develop episode low glucose level ( hypoglycaemia ) . One solution use system amount insulin inject closely matches blood sugar level continuous basis . This achieve know `` close loop system '' small glucose sensor place skin communicates computer contain algorithm drive subcutaneous insulin pump . This system develop Cambridge undergo trial child adult type 1 diabetes . Results thus far show system effective prevent hypoglycaemia maintain blood glucose level target range . We plan test close loop various challenge condition face patient daily life . One consumption alcohol , give rise delay hypoglycaemia patient diabetes . The study do clinical research facility supervise condition . Subjects attend two study night receive specific volume alcohol even meal . On one night follow closed loop algorithm control insulin overnight . On ( control ) night subject remain usual pump therapy regime overnight .</detailed_description>
