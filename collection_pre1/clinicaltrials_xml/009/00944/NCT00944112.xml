	<detailed_description>Anaemia common complication critical illness 40−50 % patient intensive care unit ( ICUs ) receive blood transfusion . However , despite perceive benefit correct anaemia , numerous non−randomised cohort study system review suggest association blood transfusion adverse patient outcome . The large randomise controlled trial compare restrictive liberal transfusion policy critically ill patient ( `` TRICC study '' ) suggest trend great morality 30 day liberal transfusion group . However TRICC study inform clinical practice regard manage long stay ICU patient . Also , importantly , blood product use TRICC study contain white blood cell ( non−leucodepleted ) , associated adverse event , whereas blood UK white blood cell remove prior blood storage ( leucodepleted ) . Due continue uncertainty many clinician continue use high Hb transfusion trigger longer−term ICU patient confirm recently survey 184 ICU clinician . This uncertainty important patient , clinician blood service . For example , patient require long stay ICU long recovery time , use significant hospital resource , suffer symptom fatigue , breathlessness reduce Health Related Quality Life ( HRQoL ) many month . It possible blood transfusion could alleviate problem . In addition , donate blood short supply increasingly expensive produce . As 40 % ICU patient receive transfusion , use 8 % Scottish blood stock , strong evidence base could optimise use precious resource . A Cochrane systematic review ( co-authored one applicant , BMcL ) note current evidence dominate TRICC trial , conclude `` ... .effects conservative transfusion trigger functional status , morbidity mortality , particularly patient cardiac disease , need test large clinical trial '' 4 . Further study clearly require determine effective transfusion practice critically ill ICU patient . We complete extensive programme work inform study . Based data identify patient population RCT address many area clinical uncertainty . We study longer-term ICU patient ( high illness severity ; high morbidity ; bad long-term functional status ; low long-term HRQoL ; great illness cost ) age ≥55 ( high incidence IHD ; le certainty regard safety restrictive approach TRICC trial ) . The treatment exposure last long TRICC trial , potentially include post-ICU care , anaemia recovers slowly . This study feasibility study compare effectiveness `` restrictive '' blood transfusion policy long−stay ICU patient `` liberal '' transfusion policy inform definitive RCT design . It design answer follow question - What proportion eligible patient recruit study ? - What difference mean Hb concentration RBCs exposure occur protocol ? - How good compliance propose study protocol ? - What factor ( ) limit recruitment result protocol violation ? - How current protocol modify large definitive trial ? - Are strong pro-inflammatory signal patient safety concern associate liberal RBCs use ? - How health economic evaluation undertake full trial ? This feasibility evaluation include three element : 1 . A single blind randomise trial comparing patient manage restrictive versus liberal strategy ( main study ) . 2 . A comparison circulate plasma level inflammatory biomarkers first 24 hour randomisation patient manage liberal restrictive strategy . 3 . An interview-based qualitative study clinician manage patient study unit . 1 . Main Study . The overall hypothesis programme work liberal use RBCs correct anaemia ( HB transfusion trigger ≤90g/L ; target Hb range 91-110 g/L ) improve clinical outcome compare restrictive transfusion trigger ( Hb transfusion trigger ≤70g/L ; target Hb range 71-90 g/L ) anaemic critically ill patient require prolonged ICU stay ( ≥4 day ) . Patients randomise one two transfusion strategy 1:1 basis Group 1 `` Restrictive RBC Transfusion group '' : Patients receive single unit RBC transfusion transfusion trigger ≤70 g/L target Hb concentration 71-90 g/L intervention period . Group 2 `` Liberal RBC transfusion group '' : Patients receive single unit RBC transfusion transfusion trigger ≤90 g/L target 91-110 g/L intervention . These patient receive transfusion day randomisation . The intervention last 14 day time randomisation discharge intensive care unit , whichever longer . The aim survive patient receive randomise intervention least 14 day case . Follow-up Complication rate ascertain case note review 60 day follow randomisation ( hospital stay ) . The length stay ICU hospital ascertain patient record Longer Term follow Patients Patients contact 60 180 day follow randomisation . At time point follow determined measure : - Survival status - Physical disability use Rivermead Mobility Index - HRQoL use SF-12 questionnaire - Health economic questionnaire determine health care resource use ( 180 day ) . 2 . Biomarker Study . The aim part study explore whether pro-inflammatory signal associate RBC transfusion intensive care patient . A range pro- anti-inflammatory marker compare patient enter restrictive group , expect receive RBCs 24 hour follow randomisation , liberal group , receive least one RBC unit 24 hour follow randomisation . Blood sample collect patient follow : Restrictive Group : A blood sample drawn follow randomisation ( time zero ) , time zero plus 6 hour , time zero plus 24 hour . Liberal Group : A blood sample drawn follow randomisation immediately prior RBC transfusion ( time zero ) , time zero plus 6 hour , time zero plus 24 hour Each blood sample 10mL volume ( total 30mL per patient ) . Plasma sample batch analyse end study . 3 . Qualitative Study . The randomised control trial ( RCT ) widely acknowledge `` gold standard '' evaluation clinical intervention . Recruitment , however , often problematic , serious implication detection important treatment difference , generalisability research finding patient population cost . A recent review demonstrate less third UK study recruit required sample size within timeframe originally specify , approximately one third require extended recruitment period . The recruitment retention participant particularly problematic critical care research , rationale currently ill-defined . Review exist literature barrier research participation suggest myriad methodological/study-specific , organisational clinician-specific issue exist . The purpose exploratory qualitative study , undertaken part RELIEVE programme work , identify address perceived barrier recruitment among clinician prior large definitive trial . The aim study - To explore clinician ' experience clinical uncertainty relation exist guidance ( default clinical decision-making ) relation recruitment compliance study protocol . - To explore clinician ' knowledge perspective exist evidence guideline relation blood transfusion practice - To explore clinician ' practice relation exist evidence guideline - To explore clinician ' prior perspective research participation particular reference patient group ( e.g . patient ischaemic heart disease ) clinical scenario ( e.g . bleed event ) might elicit clinical uncertainty relation recruitment , randomisation protocol compliance - To explore clinician ' subsequent experience trial participation reference previously describe concern - To develop potential strategy improve recruitment retention study participant . Methods We conduct qualitative semi-structured interview clinicians 6 participating centre . We invite Principal Investigator site participate , order minimise selection bias , invite second clinician `` non-vested interest '' study participate . Participants interview prior trial commencement follow trial completion . Phase I : Prior study commencement , explore ( ) clinician ' knowledge perspective exist evidence guideline relation blood transfusion practice ( b ) clinician ' practice relation exist evidence guideline ( c ) clinician ' perspective research participation per se ( ) clinician ' perspective study protocol relation patient group clinical scenario likely elicit uncertainty term recruitment , randomisation protocol adherence . Phase II : Following study completion , invite clinician describe experience perception trial participation , particular reference patient group clinical scenario recruitment , randomisation protocol adherence elicit concern uncertainty . Using screen log , Case Report Adverse Event Forms keep site dedicate research nurse , explore , possible , rationale ( ) clinician refusal eligible patient ( b ) non-compliance study protocol ( c ) withdrawal recruit patient . We invite clinician identify potential strategy address issue . Analysis The transcribed interview examine coded relevant issue use Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software ( CAQDAS ) , namely NVIVO8® . Using thematic analysis , therefore identify delineate key issue concern , express clinician , relation ( ) recruitment retention participant critical care research ( b ) recruitment retention eligible patient reference RELIEVE study protocol . Outcomes The identification `` generic '' , protocol-specific organisational barrier recruitment facilitate identification clinically locally relevant strategy address issue prior large definitive study . Using exist literature unique insight provide study , also develop refine screen tool research barrier ( ) use audit recruitment large definitive study ( b ) form basis tool relevant critical care research per se .</detailed_description>
