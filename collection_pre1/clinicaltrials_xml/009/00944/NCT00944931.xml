	<brief_summary>Background : - Direct current ( DC ) brain polarization technique weak electricity apply head . Doctors use DC polarization many year patient healthy people know serious side effect . Earlier , researcher find DC polarization temporarily improve ability healthy people think certain word . - A disadvantage exist method DC polarization use large electrode current spread large area brain . This make difficult target particular brain area . High-density DC polarization use several small electrode focus current small area brain . This study test high-density DC polarization first time human . Objectives : - To see well high-density direct current polarization work brain . - To test new method perform direct current brain polarization . Eligibility : - Healthy , right-handed adult , age 18 older , history neurological psychiatric illness . Design : - After initial screen visit clinical examination , participant may assign one experiment study . - Experiment 1 : Participants electrode place left side head , ask say aloud many word think begin certain letter . After high-density DC polarization current turn run 10 minute , participant say word begin different set letter perform reaction time think speed test . Some participant receive real polarization others , although participant tell receive polarization . - Experiment 2 : Participants DC brain polarization perform transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , use magnetic pulse activate nerve cell brain . We use TMS help u understand far effect DC polarization spread brain . After attach electrode point scalp ear , researcher give 50 TMS pulse five different place near area . These pulse produce painless muscle twitch hand arm . The TMS pulse follow DC brain polarization , another set TMS pulse see difference muscle response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The principal objective : 1 ) explore effectiveness anodal high-density direct current ( HDDC ) stimulation brain ; 2 ) test focality technique . Study Population : Up 81 healthy volunteer age 18 enrol . Design : We perform three study : 1 . A parallel trial anodal sham HDDC deliver lateral prefrontal area , 2 . An exploratory evaluation focality HDDC motor cortex 3 . A study determine whether HDDC well target use finite element model ( FEM ) base individual subject 's MRI scan ( obtain part study ) . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure effect anodal HDDC ( relative sham ) category verbal fluency , decay HDDC-induced change corticospinal output excitability distance active electrode . Performance California Computerized Assessment Package include secondary safety outcome .</detailed_description>
