	<brief_summary>Malaria African country remain important cause mortality morbidity among young child . The global malaria control strategy include prompt treatment effective antimalarial drug , vector control use ITNs curtain , indoor residual spraying ( IRS ) , intermittent preventive treatment . However , individually intervention provide imperfect protection . Thus , need investigate whether additional control measure provide add benefit reduce mortality morbidity . Therefore , 1312 child 5 year age living village hamlets near Farafenni , The Gambia , form part rural Farafenni Demographic Surveillance system ( FDSS ) North Bank Region ( NBR ) randomly allocate receive IPTc placebo village health worker base primary health care village . Treatment single dose sulfadoxine /pyrimethamine plus three dos amodiaquine placebo give study subject monthly interval three occasion month September , October November . In addition , VHWs train administer treatment coartem child develop symptom compatible malaria malaria transmission season . The primary end point incidence clinical attack malaria detect study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intermittent Preventive Treatment ( IPTc ) Home Based Management Malaria ( HMM ) The Gambia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Goals Objectives 1 . The goal project determine degree morbidity malaria prevent child receive intermittent preventive treatment ( IPTc ) SP plus amodiaquine home base management malaria Coartem village health worker 2008 malaria transmission season . 2 . The objective project conduct individually randomize trial IPTc child receive HMM North Bank Region area malaria transmission highly seasonal . This trial determine whether IPTc add significant benefit HMM . The study undertaken group 42 village hamlet near Farafenni . The village range size 46 1250 inhabitant . The total population rural FDSS catchment area 17 000 child 5 year age 3000 . The area one general hospital , three health centre two private healthcare clinic . There 18 rural primary health care ( PHC ) villages study area . PHC village , population 400 , mainly select plus , occasionally , others locate relatively isolated area . In village , village health worker ( VHWs ) traditional birth attendant ( TBAs ) select Village Development Committee ( VDC ) give 6 8 week train standardise curriculum treat common condition uncomplicated malaria , ARI , diarrhoeal disease minor injury . Thus , VHWs function primary health care provider minor illness injury age . In addition , VHW expect work community-based health educator . TBAs function birth attendant , family plan distributor health educator . Both TBAs VHWs expect refer serious case local health facility management . VHWs TBAs supervise Community Health Nurses oversee circuit 4 10 PHC village . All rural settlement also Medical Research Council ( MRC ) Village Reporter carry sensitization MRC activity . The bednet coverage NBR estimate 50 % . However , study , detail bed net usage community assess . Recruitment randomization : The study carry collaboration EPI unit Department State Health , National Malaria Control Programme NBR District Health Team . During preparatory phase study , design objective study discuss extensively NBR District Team health care provider work study area . The study team visit village study area explain objective trial village elder , opinion leader , head woman 's group , village health worker traditional birth attendant . This follow village meeting , entire community invite participate . During meeting , agreement participate study obtain villager . In addition , parent guardian prospective study subject right age group visit home provide flyer English appropriate local language ( Mandinka , Wollof Fula ) . Written inform consent obtain parent ( ) guardian ( ) child enrol study . Enrolled subject provide treatment card stamp label carry name study number facilitate identification contact . Individual randomization carry . Study subject allocate receive IPTc plus HMM HMM alone . IPTc malaria treatment : Study child receive monthly treatment VHW base PHC village . The VWH distribute trial medication central point ( usually health post ) first 10 day month September , October November . Mothers carers ask bring child central point morning VWH available distribute drug . When child present central point medication , VHW identify study subject use treatment card hold mother match information treatment card register . When satisfied correctly identify study subject , correct dosage trial medication give study subject . In non-PHC village , mother ask bring child near PHC village receive IPT transmission season . The first dose treatment take direct supervision VHW remain two dos give mother guardian child clear instruction administer drug . At end malaria transmission season , total number complete treatment dose child trial take record . Compliance check rolling basis throughout study assess number correct dose medication receive . Malaria treatment morbidity surveillance rainy season Passive surveillance malaria maintain throughout transmission season . VHW instruct treat febrile illness suggestive malaria coartem . Parents/guardians encourage take child VHW time child become unwell . One field worker attach 2-3 village health worker surveillance period . The role field worker prepare thick blood film child schedule treatment VHW coartem subsequent confirmation diagnosis . VHWs ask keep record child treat malaria . In addition , ask refer child fail improve treatment danger sign near health centre AFPRC Hospital evaluation management . Any death study child investigate within month death use post-mortem questionnaire technique . Cross-sectional survey : In December , end malaria transmission season , cross-sectional survey child enrol study undertaken village . Information obtain demographic , bed net usage , clinical history obtain physical examination perform , include abdominal palpation splenomegaly measurement height , weight axillary body temperature . A finger-prick blood sample obtain child take part cross-sectional survey preparation blood film , filter paper sample determination haemoglobin level . Definitions The following definition use course study . Clinical malaria . The primary definition malaria require : 1. presence fever ( axillary temperature &gt; 37.5 C ) history fever past 24 hour , 2. absence obvious cause fever , 3. presence P. falciparum asexual parasitemia threshold value 5,000 parasite per ul ( threshold show previously value differentiate symptomatic malaria illness associate co-incidental parasitemia ) . A secondary definition malaria require presence P. falciparum parasitemia density . Severe malaria . Severe malaria define accord WHO criteria Anemia . Anemia define haemoglobin ( Hb ) concentration &lt; 11 g/dl , moderate anemia Hb concentration &lt; 8 g/dL severe anemia Hb concentration &lt; 5 g/dl . End-points : Primary endpoint : Malaria incidence ( number study subject see OPD clinic clinical malaria meet primary case definition indicate surveillance period ) . Secondary endpoint : 1 . Malaria incidence ( number study subject see VHW clinical malaria meet secondary case definition indicate surveillance period ) . 2. incidence severe malaria define , 3. incidence anaemia among child see hospital health centre , 4. prevalence parasitaemia end malaria transmission season cross-sectional survey , 5. prevalence anaemia end malaria transmission season cross-sectional survey , ( ) incidence cause hospital admission , ( e ) incidence hospital admission due malaria , ( f ) Coverage IPTc measure follow indicator : - proportion child receive three IPT course schedule ; - proportion child receive partial off-schedule IPT course - proportion child IPT .</detailed_description>
