	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate effectiveness add plano lens weekend atropine visual acuity stabilize weekend atropine amblyopia still present . Children age 3 &lt; 8 year visual acuity 20/50 20/400 amblyopic eye enrol run-in phase weekend atropine improvement , follow randomization eligible patient weekend atropine treatment plano lens sound eye versus without plano lens sound eye . The primary objective determine add plano lens weekend atropine improve visual acuity patient amblyopia still present visual acuity stabilize initial treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Augmenting Atropine Treatment Amblyopia Children 3 &lt; 8 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amblyopia common cause monocular visual impairment child young middle-aged adult . Both patch atropine accept treatment modality management moderate amblyopia children.1 Many practitioner prescribe weekend atropine initial therapy amblyopia . However , many child fail achieve normal visual acuity amblyopic eye treatment regimen . In randomized trial conduct PEDIG compare atropine regimen , 58 83 patient moderate amblyopia ( 70 % ) amblyopic eye visual acuity 20/32 bad 4 month treatment weekend atropine.2 In another PEDIG randomize trial compare atropine plano lens versus without plano lens initial treatment amblyopia , 60 84 patient moderate amblyopia ( 71 % ) amblyopic eye visual acuity 20/32 bad 16 week treatment weekend atropine.3 When improvement stop initial therapy amblyopia still present , treatment option include increase dosage current treatment , switch another treatment , maintain treatment dosage , combine treatment . Many clinician add plano lens sound eye atropine treatment , part family use atropine become comfortable use . This option limit child hypermetropia sound eye . However , unknown whether add plano lens sound eye improve amblyopic eye visual acuity continue atropine alone patient show improvement initial treatment atropine . In PEDIG randomize trial compare patch atropine initial treatment amblyopia , plano lens prescribe sound eye 55 patient improved 20/30 least 3 line 4 month daily atropine use.1 , 4 Their mean acuity improvement prior use plano lens 1.0 line , compare 1.6 line prescribe plano lens . We unaware report response treatment amblyopia still present initial treatment weekend atropine .</detailed_description>

Hypermetropia spectacle correction sound eye +1.50 D Eligibility Criteria Randomization : Amblyopic eye acuity 20/40 20/160 interocular difference &gt; 2 line , amblyopic eye acuity 20/32 3 line IOD . Compliance weekend atropine treatment base investigator judgment . Currently use vision therapy orthoptics Ocular cause reduce visual acuity ( nystagmus per se exclude patient visual acuity criterion meet ) Prior intraocular refractive surgery Known allergy atropine cycloplegic drug Down Syndrome present</criteria>
