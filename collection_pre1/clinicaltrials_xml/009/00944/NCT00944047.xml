	<brief_title>Evaluate Trastuzumab Plus Standard Chemotherapy Given Before Surgery Breast Cancer Patients With Low HER 2 Expression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neoadjuvant ( primary ) chemotherapy refers chemotherapy give surgery . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy number potential advantage include increase chance breast preservation time surgery well may improve local control cancer . Several national breast cancer study show neoadjuvant chemotherapy equal chemotherapy give follow surgery . A standard treatment stage II Stage III invasive breast cancer low HER2 expression combination chemotherapyAdriamycin , Cytoxan , follow Taxane : give either surgery ) , follow surgery +/- radiation therapy . The main purpose chemotherapy however reduce risk recurrence cancer also make surgery successful . HER2 receptor locate surface cell . This receptor play role regulate growth cell , addition growth tumor . High level HER2 receptor may predict woman benefit treatment agent Herceptin target HER2 . Herceptin ( Trastuzumab ) drug effective alone combination standard chemotherapy . There data suggest patient whose tumor low expression HER2 protein normal FISH may also receive benefit Herceptin .</detailed_description>
