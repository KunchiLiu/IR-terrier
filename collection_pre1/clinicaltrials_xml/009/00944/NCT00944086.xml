	<brief_summary>In This Study , Our Goal Compare Effects Recruitment Manoeuvre Which Applied With Different Oxygen Concentrations Oxygenation Respiratory Mechanics During Pneumoperitoneum</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxygen Concentration Should Kept Lowest Possible Level During Recruitment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description : `` Recruitment manoeuvre '' define become popular recent year nowadays widely accept apply . The positive effect recruitment manoeuvre surgery respiratory mechanic oxygenation report . The duration apply pressure value recruitment manoeuvre define well detail regard definition manoeuvre ( 1-3 ) . Despite definition , detailed information provide effect oxygen oxygen concentration recruitment manoeuvre . Atelectasis develop induction anaesthesia , even healthy subject , associate increase intraoperative shunt lead impairment gas exchange ( 4 ) . It well known patient , undergone mechanical ventilation high oxygen concentration level , oxygen replaces less insoluble nitrogen . Partial oxygen pressure increase implementation oxygen high concentration , oxygen flow blood increase . But gas flow blood inspire , absorption atelectasis develop lung - due appliance high oxygen concentration . Atelectasis may also develop due different reason failure secretion clearance surgery , replacement nitrogen inhalation anaesthetic appliance pneumoperitoneum . In recent year , many study analyze effect recruitment manoeuvre pneumoperitoneum laparoscopic surgery respiratory mechanic oxygenation , report benefit recruitment operation ( 4-6 ) . In study , goal compare effect recruitment manoeuvre apply different oxygen concentration oxygenation respiratory mechanic pneumoperitoneum .</detailed_description>
