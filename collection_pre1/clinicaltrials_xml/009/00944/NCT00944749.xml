	<brief_summary>Background : - Severe plastic anemia lead problem bone marrow platelet production result low blood platelet count , require frequent platelet transfusion improve blood clotting . - A standard treatment SAA involve injection rabbit-antithymocyte globulin ( r-ATG ) . r-ATG develop inject horse type human white blood cell call thymocytes . The horse 's immune system react cell make antibody destroy . These antibody collect purified make r-ATG . Horses also use procedure make horse-antithymocyte globulin ( h-ATG ) . - h-ATG approved Food Drug Administration treatment aplastic anemia . h-ATG standard first-line method treat aplastic anemia , researcher know effective patient first treat unsuccessfully r-ATG . Objectives : - To evaluate effectiveness safety horse-ATG ( cyclosporine ) increase blood count reduce need transfusion aplastic anemia patient fail respond prior immunosuppressive treatment rabbit-ATG cyclosporine . Eligibility : - Patients 2 year age old consistently low blood platelet count relate aplastic anemia respond conventional treatment rabbit-ATG . Design : - After initial screening , medical history , blood test , patient admit inpatient unit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . Researchers perform skin test h-ATG check allergic adverse reaction . - After skin test , h-ATG give vein continuously 4 day . - Cyclosporine also give improve response rate ATG treatment . Treatment cyclosporine start day h-ATG , either liquid capsule form , continue 6 month . The dose cyclosporine monitor adjust base blood level sign side effect kidney liver . - To prevent treat infection may result cyclosporine effect immune system , patient also take inhaled capsule dos pentamidine . - After study complete , patient followup evaluation every 3 month , 6 month , annually 5 year . Evaluations include blood sample periodic bone marrow biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Horse ATG/CsA Aplastic Anemia Patients Unresponsive With Suboptimal Response Rabbit ATG/CsA Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe aplastic anemia ( SAA ) , characterize pancytopenia hypocellular bone marrow , effectively treat immunosuppressive therapy , usually combination antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) cyclosporine ( CsA ) . Survival rate follow regimen equivalent achieve allogeneic stem cell transplantation . However , approximately 1/3 patient show blood count improvement ATG/CsA . General experience small pilot study suggest patient benefit immunosuppression . Furthermore , analysis clinical data suggest patient minimal blood count response single course ATG , even transfusion independence achieve , markedly bad prognosis patient robust hematologic improvement . The majority experience US worldwide horse ATG ( h-ATG ) plus CsA initial therapy SAA . Rabbit ATG ( r-ATG ) plus CsA employ successfully 1/3 case refractory initial h-ATG/CsA ( current NHLBI Protocol 03-H-0249 ) . In recent year , h-ATG r-ATG use interchangeably treatment-naive patient , initial therapy r-ATG/CsA frequent US option Europe Japan , h-ATG longer available . An active NHLBI randomize study compare efficacy h- r-ATG initial therapy SAA , result recently complete interim analysis suggest hematologic response rate ultimately may comparable two agent ( Protocol 06-H-0034 ) . There publish report outcome repeat immunosuppressive therapy patient refractory initial r-ATG/CsA , thus management patient uncertain . We therefore propose study h-ATG/CsA SAA patient refractory suboptimal response r-ATG . The primary endpoint response rate 3 month response define longer meet criterion SAA . The primary objective evaluate effectiveness ( response rate ) 3 month second course immunosuppression h-ATG/CsA subject refractory suboptimal response course r-ATG/CsA cyclophosphamide least 3 month post treatment . Secondary objective include robustness hematologic recovery , relapse , response rate 6 month , clonal evolution overall survival . The primary endpoint change absolute neutrophil count , platelet count , reticulocyte count 3 month . Secondary endpoint include time relapse , change cytogenetics , time death .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient 2 year old SAA fail initial immunosuppression rATG/CsA candidate match sibling marrow transplantation consider enrollment . Patients suitable match sibling donor refer consideration allogeneic bone marrow transplantation . Patients willing undergo transplantation consider enrollment . Eligibility determine another screen Hematology Branch protocol ( 97H0041 ) another active Hematology branch protocol . The time determination eligibility sign consent participate protocol initiate treatment protocol exceed 90 day . INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Diagnosed SAA characterize : 1 . Bone marrow cellularity &lt; 30 % ( exclude lymphocyte ) 2 . At least two follow : . Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500/ microL ii . Platelet count &lt; 20,000/ microL iii . Reticulocyte count &lt; 60,000/ microL 2 . Failure respond initial course rATG/CsA cyclophosphamide least 3 month posttreatment suboptimal response initial therapy define platelet reticulocyte count &lt; 50,000 /microL 3 month posttreatment 3 . Age great equal 2 year age EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Diagnosis Fanconi anemia . Patients severe neutropenia ( ANC &lt; 200 /microL ) exclude initially result Fanconi anemia test available pending . If evidence Fanconi anemia later identify , subject go study . 2 . Evidence clonal disorder cytogenetics . Patients severe neutropenia ( ANC &lt; 200/uL ) exclude initially result cytogenetics available pending . If evidence clonal disorder later identify , subject go study . 3 . Patients receive prior course ( ) alemtuzumab exclude . 4 . Infection adequately respond appropriate therapy 5 . HIV seropositivity 6 . Moribund status concurrent hepatic , renal , cardiac , neurologic , pulmonary , infectious , metabolic disease severity would preclude patient ability tolerate protocol therapy death within 710 day likely . 7 .
