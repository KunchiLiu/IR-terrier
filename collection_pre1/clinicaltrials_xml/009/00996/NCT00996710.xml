	<brief_summary>This study look new type gene change may relate cancer patient . Some gene change ( mutation ) pass parent offspring ( child ) . Other gene change new see first time child . They see parent . Some gene change may cause cancer offspring . We look gene change study patient cancer parent family member without cancer . In study , able find gene change occur cancer patient rest family . Knowing role new gene change play cancer risk may help u find people high risk get cancer .</brief_summary>
