	<criteria>Week 1 ( screen visit ) Patients diagnose symptomatic restless legs syndrome associate Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) manage haemodialysis ( include haemofiltration haemodiafiltration ) . RLS diagnose base International RLS Study Group 's ( IRLSSG ) Diagnostic Criteria . Patients chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) haemodialysis ( include haemofiltration haemodiafiltration ) least 3 month prior screen period receive adequate haemodialysis prescription ( i.e . singlepool Kt/V &gt; 1.0 . Shinzato calculate formula [ Shinzato , 1994 ] use Japanese Society Dialysis Therapy use . ) Patients age ≥18 year &lt; 80 year . Patients RLS symptom 20 day 28 day start screen period . However , patient receive drug therapy RLS start screen period apply criterion meeting condition : The patient 's drug therapy ( exclude Anxiolytics Hypnotics sedative medication ) RLS discontinue time start screening period . For RLS symptom subject consider continue 20 day 28 day start drug treatment RLS . QTc criterion ( QTc [ b f ] , mechanical manual reread , male female ) : Patients QTc &lt; 450 msec &lt; 480 msec patient bundle branch block ( BBB ) value base either single electrocardiogram ( ECG ) value triplicate ECG average QTc value obtain brief recording period . Male female patient . A female subject eligible enter participate study : Is nonchildbearing potential Is childbearing potential , lactate agrees use one GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) specify highly effective method avoid pregnancy : abstinence , oral contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone ( see `` Permitted medication '' ) , injectable progestogen , implant levonorgestrel , estrogenic vaginal ring ( see `` Permitted medication '' ) , percutaneous contraceptive patch ( see `` Permitted medication '' ) , intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) meet SOP effectiveness criterion state product label , male partner sterilization ( vasectomy documentation azoospermia ) prior female subject 's entry study , male sole partner subject , double barrier method ( condom occlusive cap [ diaphragm cervical/vault cap ] plus spermicidal agent [ foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ] ) . Outpatients Patients able give inform write consent person . Legal representative also give inform write consent , patient twenty year old . Week 0 ( start treatment period ) Patients experience RLS symptom least 4 day within 7 day start treatment period . Patients sleep disturbance associate RLS . Patients answer 3 ( severe ) 4 ( severe ) Question 4 ( Sleep disturbance ) IRLS Rating Scale . Patients whose IRLS Rating Scale total score 15 point . Liver function test : Patients aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2 * ULN ( upper limit normal ) ; bilirubin ≤ 1.5 * ULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5 ULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) week 1 ( screen visit ) . ULN ALT ( GTP ) AST ( GOT ) 20 IU/L [ Kurokawa , 2002 ] . A female subject negative pregnancy test week 1 ( screen visit ) . Week 1 ( screen visit ) Patients sign primary RLS ( Patients develop RLS symptom since kidney function normal ) Patients follow sleep disorder associate RLS e.g . narcolepsy , sleep terror disorder , sleepwalk disorder , breathe related sleep disorder Patients complication movement disorder ( e.g . Parkinson 's disease , dyskinesia , dystonia , etc ) Patients severe hepatic/cardiac/pulmonary disorder haematopoietic disorder haemodialysis ( include haemofiltration haemodiafiltration ) . The severity refers Grade 3 accord `` Classification Severity Adverse Experiences '' ( Pharmaceutical affair bureau/Safety division ( PAB/SD ) Notification No . 80 , date 29 June 1992 ) . Patients history malignancy within past 5 year , exception basal cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix . Patients medical history complication substance abuse ( e.g . alcohol drug ) dependency substance last one year . Patients supine systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &lt; 100 mmHg &gt; 190 mmHg supine diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) ≥120 mmHg dialysis conduct long interval , screen visit . Patients intolerant ropinirole hydrochloride ( HCl ) dopamine agonist . Patients ropinirole HCl dopamine agonist consider safety concern investigator/subinvestigator Patients history augmentation Endofdoserebound early morning medication dopamine agonist ( include ropinirole HCl ) and/or LDopa . Augmentation define follow : RLS symptom occur treatment occur ≧ 2 hour earlier . Symptoms severe treat . Symptoms start less time rest treatment . Symptoms involve part body , arm trunk . Patients without night time sleep habit ( e.g . nightshift worker , etc ) must drastically change habitual bedtime study duration . Patients participate another clinical study investigational product medical device within last 12 week prior start screen period . Female patient pregnant lactating , may pregnant , plan pregnancy study . ( Instructions give woman childbearing potential practice adequate contraception even plan pregnancy ) . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) Presence hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , positive Hepatitis C test result within 3 month screen . Patients medical condition , opinion investigator/subinvestigator could affect efficacy safety assessment . This may include follow disorder : fibromyalgia syndrome , rheumatoid arthritis , symptomatic orthostatic hypotension , hepatic failure , pulmonary fibrosis . Subject unable discontinue prohibit medication Screening period . Subjects know imminently receive transplant Patients change dose administration method Anxiolytics Hypnotics sedative within last 4 week prior start screen period Patients use two drug . Others investigator/subinvestigator considers ineligible study . Week 0 ( start treatment period ) Patients supine SBP &lt; 100 mmHg &gt; 190 mmHg supine DBP ≥120 mmHg dialysis conduct long interval , Week 0 ( start treatment period ) . Patients start treatment medication include estrogen drug product , drug know substantially induce inhibit CYP1A2 , antihistamine ( ocular instillation dermal application , preparation contain fexofenadine HCl loratadine ) , Anxiolytics , Hypnotics sedative change dose administration method medication Week 1 ( start screen period ) Week 0 ( start treatment period ) . Patients whose serum ferritin level &lt; 10 μg/L ( ng/mL ) screen visit .</criteria>
