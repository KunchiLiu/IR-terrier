	<brief_summary>Study chemotherapy consist four treatment Velcade ( day 1 , 4 , 15 , 18 ) two treatment Eloxatin ( day 4 18 ) . Patients undergo standard care blood work Quality Life ( QOL ) questionnaires visit repeat CT scan perform assess tumor response every 2 cycle ( 8 week ) . Each patient allow receive maximum 6 cycle therapy . Following discontinuation treatment due disease progression completion therapy , patient 's followed survival , QOL assessment , tumor assessment every 3 month ( clinically indicate ) first year every 3 month thereafter maximum 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Velcade Eloxatin Patients With Malignant Pleural Peritoneal Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine objective tumor response rate VELCADE plus ELOXATIN patient malignant mesothelioma . The aim study : ( ) determine tumor response rate , median survival , time response , duration response time treatment failure progression disease ; ( b ) ascertain vitro assessment gene expression profile via PCR use ascertain patient 's response VELCADE ( bortezomib ) therapy ( c ) characterize quantitative qualitative toxicity VELCADE plus ELOXATIN patient population . Each cycle treatment compose 28 day consist four treatment VELCADE ( 1,4,15 , 18 ) two treatment ELOXATIN ( day 4 , 18 ) . Patients undergo physical examination routine blood work visit . A Quality Life ( QOL ) assessment perform prior initiating cycle therapy CT scan perform baseline every 2 cycle ( 8 week ) assess tumor response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm malignant pleural peritoneal mesothelioma epithelial , sarcomatoid , mixed subtype , amenable curative treatment surgery . Patients pleural mesothelioma clinically stag use IMIG 's stag criterion ( section 17.1 ) . Note stag system peritoneal mesothelioma patient follow survival . Patients may enter base local pathology . Patients must ≤2 prior form systemic chemotherapy . Prior intracavitary chemotherapy consider prior regimen unless give purpose pleurodesis . Immunomodulators regard chemotherapy . Prior systemic treatment pemetrexed plus cisplatin carboplatin contraindication treatment VELCADE/ELOXATIN . Disease status must measurable disease define modify SWOG criterion . Measurable disease : The presence least one measurable lesion . If one lesion present , neoplastic nature disease site confirm histology . Measurable lesion : Lesions accurately measure least one dimension long diameter ≥20 mm use conventional technique ≥10 mm use spiral CT scan . At least one level must one rind measurement ≥15 mm . CT ( specifically spiral CT ) scan MRI preferred method measurement . Clinically detected lesion consider measurable superficial ( e.g. , skin nodule palpable lymph node ) . For case skin lesion , documentation color photography , include ruler estimate size lesion require . NOTE : Neither pleural effusion positive bone scan consider measurable . Patients may undergo pleurodesis . If pleurodesis recently perform , must minimum 2 week delay prior treatment initiation . If CT scan do prior pleurodesis , repeat CT scan baseline evaluation need perform prior study entry . NOTE : For patient clinically significant pleural effusion ascites , consideration give drain fluid prior initiate therapy . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , 2 ( palliative measure include pleural drainage occur ) , see section 14.2 . Patients must estimate life expectancy least 12 week . Patient assurance study compliance geographic proximity allow adequate followup . Patients must adequate organ function screen visit define follow laboratory value : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL . Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL Total Bilirubin ≤2.5 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤3.0 x ULN Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤3.0 x ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN NOTE : total bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase , AST , ALT ≤5 x ULN acceptable liver tumor involvement Voluntary write informed consent performance studyrelated procedure part normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw subject time without prejudice future medical care . Patient must male female least 18 year age . Female subject must either postmenopausal surgically sterilize willing use acceptable method birth control ( i.e. , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide , abstinence ) duration study . Male subject must agree use acceptable method contraception duration study . Has active peripheral neuropathy Grade 2 great intensity , define National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ; Version 3 ) . Has experience myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment New York Hospital Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , ECG abnormality note documented investigator medically relevant . Has treat previously VELCADE ELOXATIN . Has prior radiation therapy target lesion , unless lesion clearly progress interval recent radiation therapy enrollment least 4 week . Has uncontrolled active systemic infection require therapy . Has history allergic reaction attributable compound contain boron mannitol hypersensitivity reaction drug formulate polysorbate 80 . Female subject pregnant breastfeeding . Has serious concomitant systemic disorder ( include oncologic emergency ) incompatible study ( discretion investigator ) . Has `` currently active '' second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix register . Patients consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy consider physician less 30 % risk relapse . Has investigational agent within 4 week prior enrollment study . Is unwilling employ adequate mean contraception ( condom , diaphragm , birth control pill , injection , intrauterine device , abstinence ) . Has disease radiologically image . Has serious medical psychiatric illness likely interfere participation clinical study .</criteria>
