	<brief_summary>Different medication often use combination condition COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) . Some medicine act open airway ( bronchodilator ) act anti-inflammatory ( steroid ) . More recently approach use combination inhaler ( contain steroid long-acting bronchodilator ) time long acting bronchodilator different group medicine ( anti-cholinergics inhaler ) use . This approach sometimes call 'triple therapy ' . Studies look combination usually use standard blowing test ( spirometry ) test medicine focus effect medicine high ( peak ) level . It way relevant study medicine towards end dose period ( trough ) - next dose . This less medicine system , difference drug effect obvious . There also detail breathe test spirometry get detailed picture way lung respond bronchodilator medicine . The investigator study 'triple therapy ' COPD , measure effect end dose interval ( trough ) use range detailed respiratory test .</brief_summary>
