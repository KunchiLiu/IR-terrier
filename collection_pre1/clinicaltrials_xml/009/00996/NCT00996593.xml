	<brief_summary>This single-arm , open-label , multicenter study Iodine I-131 Anti B1 Antibody ( Tositumomab Iodine I 131 Tositumomab ) treatment non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) previously treat rituximab antibody . Patients must treat least 4 dos rituximab progress follow rituximab therapy . Patients undergo two dose phase study . In first phase , term `` dosimetric dose '' , patient receive infusion unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody ( 450 mg ) 70 minute immediately follow 30-minute infusion Anti-B1 Antibody ( 35 mg ) radiolabeled 5 mCi Iodine-131 . Whole body gamma camera scan obtain Day 0 ; Day 2 , 3 , 4 ; Day 6 7 follow dosimetric dose . Using dosimetric data three image timepoints , patient-specific dose Iodine-131 calculate deliver desire total body dose radiotherapy . In second phase , term `` therapeutic dose '' , patient receive 70-minute infusion unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody ( 450 mg ) immediately follow 30-minute infusion 35 mg Anti-B1 Antibody label patient-specific dose Iodine-131 deliver whole body dose 75 cGy patient hematologic risk factor . Patients platelet count 100,001-149,999 cells/mm3 receive 65 cGy patient obese dose base upon 137 % lean body mass . Patients treat either saturate solution potassium iodide ( SSKI ) , Lugol 's solution , potassium iodide tablet start least 24 hour prior first infusion Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody ( i.e. , dosimetric dose ) continue 14 day follow last infusion Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody ( i.e. , therapeutic dose ) . The endpoint study determine response rate , complete response rate , duration response , time progression death , base Masked Independent Randomized Radiographic Oncologic Review ( MIRROR ) panel Investigators , Investigators ' assessment safety survival survival Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody therapy NHL patient previously treat rituximab .</brief_summary>
