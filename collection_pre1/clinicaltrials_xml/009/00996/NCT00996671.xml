	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety new drug look drug handle body . This first time drug give people , drug safely give animal many day higher dos give study . The study do healthy men woman determine effect , good bad , thier health . This study find : If drug side effect one dose drug give ? How much drug get bloodstream , long body take get rid ? If drug cause change substance skin , hair blood .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Evaluate Safety , Pharmacokinetics Pharmacodynamics GSK2256098 Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study represent first administration focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) inhibitor GSK2256098 human evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) , preliminary food effect follow single oral dos adult healthy subject proceed study subject cancer give high dos extend period time . FAK protein body important cancer development . Objectives study characterize safety single dose GSK2256098 ; characterize single dose PK GSK2256098 presence absence food ; examine dose proportionality GSK2256098 PK parameter follow single dose administration ; characterize effect single dos GSK2256098 phospho-FAK ( pFAK ) tyrosine 397 ( Y397 ) level skin hair follicle . Dose- concentration-effect relationship various safety parameter explore appropriate .</detailed_description>
