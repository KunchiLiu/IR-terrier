	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate safety best dose regimen include bevacizumab erlotinib combination docetaxel prednisone . In addition , investigator wish evaluate well drug might work disease . Bevacizumab erlotinib novel drug attack blood vessel supply tumor cell attack receptor tumor cell , respectively . This study two part . In first part study , eighteen patient enrol . Patients receive escalate dos docetaxel combination standard dose bevacizumab erlotinib safe dose determine . An additional 37 patient enter second part study receive safe dose . In part study , effectiveness regimen hormone refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) monitor evaluate prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) objective response tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In Phase I/Phase II study , primary objective establish maximum tolerate dose docetaxel , erlotinib , bevacizumab , prednisone patient metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer determine efficacy regimen treatment metastatic HRPC . In phase I portion study , eligible patient enrol treated use `` 3+3 '' design . Docetaxel start 55 mg/m2 every cycle ( 21 day ) dose escalate 10 mg/m2 cohort level . The dose bevacizumab hold constant 15 mg/kg every 3 week erlotinib provide 200 mg PO daily day 216 describe previous safety study . All patient receive prednisone 5 mg PO bid . Eighteen patient treat phase I portion . The phase II dose combine treatment define either high dosage cohort 6 patient treat less 3 DLTs ; combination docetaxel , erlotinib , bevacizumab cohort 3 dose level , whichever low dose . Another 37 patient enrol phase II study . All patient receive phase II recommend dose determined phase I portion study .</detailed_description>
