	<brief_title>Mycotic Ulcer Treatment Trial I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fungal corneal ulcer tend poor outcome commonly use treatment . There single randomize trial anti-fungal therapy mycotic keratitis , new ocular anti-fungal medication approve FDA since 1960s . The triazole voriconazole recently become treatment choice systemic fungal infection pulmonary aspergillosis . The use topical ophthalmic preparation voriconazole describe numerous case report , however systematic attempt determine whether less clinically effective natamycin . Additionally , many case report use oral voriconazole treatment fungal corneal ulcer , however systematic attempt determine improve outcomes severe ulcer . This study randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled trial determine use natamycin voriconazole result well outcomes fungal corneal ulcer . 368 fungal corneal ulcer baseline visual acuity 6/12 ( 20/40 , logMAR 0.3 ) 6/120 ( 20/400 , logMAR 1.3 ) presenting Aravind Eye Hospitals UCSF Proctor Foundation randomize receive either topical natamycin topical voriconazole . The primary outcome best spectacle-corrected logMAR visual acuity three month enrollment , use best spectacle-corrected enrollment visual acuity co-variate .</detailed_description>
