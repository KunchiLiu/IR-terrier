	<brief_summary>This study assess alternative formulation lapatinib relative bioavailability bioequivalence ( BE ) current commercial formulation ( reference ) . Subjects dose least one week ( 7 day ) formulation PK sample collect lapatinib formulation dose Period Period 1 Day 7 Period 2 Day7 pre-dose 24 hr post dose . The study may evaluate three alternative test formulation . After subject complete PK evaluation End Study Visit , eligible , option enter EGF111767 , open-label , Phase Ib continuation study lapatinib monotherapy lapatinib combination anti-cancer treatment .</brief_summary>
