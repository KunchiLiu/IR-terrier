	<brief_summary>Inhalation treatment mucolytics one cornerstone CF treatment respiratory problem . The efficacy inhalation treatment recombinant DNAse hypertonic saline well establish . The North American CF foundation report insufficient evidence chronic use inhale N-Acetylcysteine ( NAC ) improve lung function reduce exacerbation . In vitro test prove positive effect NAC sputum rheology . Evidence base research however vivo effect NAC visco-elasticity lung function rare . There three randomize control clinical trial nebulised NAC , none show statistically significant clinically relevant beneficial effect . Nevertheless least Europe many year inhalation treatment NAC advise . Because disgust sulphur odour , many patient reluctant use inhalation medication . We intend start open placebo control vivo cross-over study evaluate effect Acetyl cysteine compare normal saline sputum visco-elasticity short term effect lung function . Sputum produce CF-patients , able perform lung function test enrol . Sputum viscoelasticity measure controlled-stress rheometer ( AR 1000-N ; TA-Instruments , Ghent , Belgium ) 20° C , use cone-plate geometry 8 . Lung function measurement ( FVC , FEV1 , FEF 25-75 ) do Masterlab body plethysmograph ( Jaeger® ) Sputum sample collect lung function test regular control visit . Three ml NAC 4 ml normal saline inhale , afterwards second sputum sample collect control lung function test perform . Visco-elasticity measurement do sputum sample inhalation NAC normal saline . Patients continue inhale N-acetylcysteine normal saline two time per day one month . After one month control lung function third sputum sample collect , visco-elasticity lung function measure compare initial value group group . After wash-out period normal saline inhalation 2 week group , patient initial control group ask switch inhalation 3 ml NAC two time per day former NAC group continue inhale two time 4 ml normal saline four week . After one month measurement visco-elasticity lung function test do .</brief_summary>
