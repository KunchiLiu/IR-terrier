	<brief_summary>This single-arm , single-institution , phase II study Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody patient previously untreated , advanced-stage ( stage III IV ) low-grade non-Hodgkin 's B-cell lymphoma . A total 75-80 patient enrol . Patients undergo two phase study . In first phase , term `` dosimetric dose '' , patient receive infusion unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody ( 450 mg ) 70 minute ( include 10-minute flush ) immediately follow 30-minute infusion ( include 10-minute flush ) Anti-B1 Antibody ( 35 mg ) trace-labeled 5 mCi Iodine-131 . Whole body gamma camera scan obtain 5 8 time Days 0 7 follow dosimetric dose . Using dosimetric data 3 imaging timepoints ( image timepoints use decrease order preference depend availability data Days 0 , 3 , 7 ; Days 0 , 4 , 7 ; Days 0 , 3 6 ; Days 0 , 4 , 6 ; Days 0 , 2 , 7 ; Days 0 , 2 , 6 ) , patient-specific dose Iodine- 131 deliver desire total body dose radiotherapy calculate . In second phase , term `` therapeutic dose '' , patient receive 70-minute infusion ( include 10-minute flush ) unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody ( 450 mg ) immediately follow 30-minute infusion ( include 10-minute flush ) Anti-B1 Antibody ( 35 mg ) label patient-specific dose Iodine-131 deliver whole body dose 75 cGy . Patients obese dose base upon 137 % calculated lean body mass . Patients treat either saturate solution potassium iodide ( SSKI ) , Lugol 's solution , potassium iodide tablet start least 24 hour prior first infusion Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody ( i.e. , dosimetric dose ) continue 14 day follow last infusion Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody ( i.e. , therapeutic dose ) . The primary endpoint study determination response rate Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody previously untreated patient low-grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) . The secondary endpoint include duration response , safety , radiation dosimetry , predictive value detection presence absence minimal residual disease molecular technique response duration .</brief_summary>
