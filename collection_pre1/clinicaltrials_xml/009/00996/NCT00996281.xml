	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Azilsartan Medoxomil Plus Chlorthalidone Compared Olmesartan Medoxomil Plus Hydrochlorothiazide Participants With Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High Blood Pressure ( Hypertension ) common cause preventable death develop nation . Uncontrolled hypertension greatly increase risk heart disease , brain disease , kidney failure . As population age , incidence hypertension continue increase effective preventive measure implement . Despite availability antihypertensive agent , hypertension adequately control ; one three patient successfully keep blood pressure normal . Treatment high blood pressure include thiazide thiazide-like diuretic , either alone part combination treatment . Chlorthalidone commercially available , orally administer thiazide-type diuretic agent . TAK-491 ( azilsartan ) angiotensin II receptor blocker evaluate Takeda treat patient high blood pressure ( essential hypertension ) . This study compare safety tolerability azilsartan medoxomil plus chlorthalidone ( TAK-491CLD ) fixed-dose combination olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide fixed-dose combination . Initially patient undergo Screening Visit confirm eligible participate study . All participant receive study drug 52 week . The dose study drug may gradually increase throughout study target blood pressure value reach participant . Throughout treatment period study , participant require visit research site 11 visit . At study visit participant require undergo certain study procedure include physical examination , vital sign measurement ( blood pressure , heart rate , weight height ) , electrocardiogram ( monitor heart ) , blood urine sample take clinical laboratory test .</detailed_description>
