	<detailed_description>The purpose study two-fold . First , determine algorithm develop base pre-implant clinical variable predict response CRT-D therapy . Second , study aim determine patient implanted CRT-D combine use cTnT BNP predict risk-stratify HF improvement all-cause mortality . Additionally , novel biochemical marker define cardiac mortality high risk patient detect plasma proteomic analysis CRT-D patient evaluate . This study represent combination previous CRT study evaluate variable independently . Data study pool data previous study build complete picture CRT therapy .</detailed_description>
