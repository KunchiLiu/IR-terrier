	<brief_title>Intravitreal Ranibizumab Vitreous Hemorrhage Due Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy ( N )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In mild moderate case vitreous hemorrhage , panretinal photocoagulation ( PRP ) perform possible achieve regression new vessel least stabilization neovascularization growth order decrease probability subsequent vitreous hemorrhage spontaneous absorption hemorrhage occur . In case hemorrhage dense apply PRP , vitrectomy consider remove hemorrhage provide clear medium application PRP ( often endolaser photocoagulation ) well eliminate extensive neovascularization relieve traction retinal detachment . Pars plana vitrectomy introduce 1970s surgical intervention diabetes non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage , traction retinal detachment severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) . The goal vitrectomy eye remove hemorrhage provide clear medium application PRP ( often endolaser photocoagulation ) well eliminate extensive neovascularization relieve traction retinal detachment . Many advance instrumentation technique result dramatic reduction complication last decade , surgical complication remain include follow : neovascular glaucoma , retinal detachment , fibrinoid syndrome , endophthalmitis hypotony subsequent phthisis bulbi . Recovery subject take 6 week . Increased vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) level demonstrate retina vitreous human eye diabetic retinopathy , especially PDR . VEGF demonstrate increase vessel permeability increase phosphorylation tight junction protein , show increase retinal vascular permeability vivo model . Anti-VEGF therapy , therefore , may represent useful therapeutic modality target underlie pathogenesis PDR vitreous hemorrhage clear facilitate placement PRP , potentially avoid vitrectomy . This study design determine intravitreal injection ranibizumab facilitate clearing vitreous hemorrhage avoidance vitrectomy potential complication . Compared surgical intervention , use intravitreal agent associate few vitrectomy would preferable reduced cost , reduce time treatment , reduce intervention time , relatively low risk side effect , reduce recovery time . An intravitreal agent also would useful alternative patient unwilling undergo surgery . Furthermore , study determine safety medication set PDR .</detailed_description>

Exclusion A subject eligible follow exclusion criterion present : A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude subject undergo elective vitrectomy surgery indicate study . Participation investigational trial involve treatment drug within 30 day randomization receive regulatory approval time study entry . Known allergy component study drug . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 diastolic 110 ) . Myocardial infarction , cardiac event require hospitalization , stroke , transient ischemic attack , treatment acute congestive heart failure within 4 month prior randomization . Systemic antiVEGF proVEGF treatment within 4 month prior randomization . For woman childbearing potential : pregnant lactate intend become pregnant within next 4 month . Subject expect move area clinical center area cover another clinical center 12 month study . Study Eye Criteria The subject must least one eye meeting inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion list . A subject one study eye . If eye eligible time randomization , study eye select investigator subject randomization . The eligibility criterion study eye follow : Inclusion Vitreous hemorrhage cause vision impairment , presume proliferative diabetic retinopathy , preclude completion panretinal photocoagulation ( preclude assessment completeness prior PRP ) . Immediate vitrectomy require ( investigator subject willing wait least 8 week see hemorrhage clear sufficiently without proceed vitrectomy ) . Visual acuity light perception well . Exclusion Prompt vitrectomy indicate , sign rhegmatogenous retinal detachment traction detachment involve macula present ultrasound . Exam evidence neovascular glaucoma , angle neovascularization , active neovascularization iris ( small iris tuft exclusion ) . History intravitreal antiVEGF treatment vitreous hemorrhage time past indication vitreous hemorrhage past 2 month . History major ocular surgery ( include cataract extraction , scleral buckle , intraocular surgery , etc . ) within prior 4 month major ocular surgery vitrectomy anticipate within next 6 month follow randomization . History vitrectomy . History yttrium aluminum garnet capsulotomy perform within 2 month prior randomization . Aphakia . Uncontrolled glaucoma ( investigator 's judgment ) . Exam evidence severe external ocular infection , include conjunctivitis , chalazion , substantial blepharitis .</criteria>
