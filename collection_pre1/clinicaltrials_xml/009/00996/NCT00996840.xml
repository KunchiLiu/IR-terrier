	<brief_summary>This early phase ( Phase IIa ) , randomize , double-blind , parallel group , multi-centre study subject trauma ( physical injury ) risk develop Acute Lung Injury ( ALI ) Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) . The primary purpose study evaluate safety tolerability SB-681323 , potent , selective inhibitor p38 alpha ( MAPK ) ( prevents inflammation tissue ) , comparison placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SB-681323 IV Subjects Risk Acute Lung Injury ARDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) form severe lung injury ( ALI ) characterize hypoxemic respiratory failure ( lung unable absorb oxygen arterial blood ) non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema ( accumulation fluid lung ) . The syndrome may cause direct indirect injury lung . It associate mortality rate 40-50 % . There market pharmacologic therapy devastate syndrome . This study aim assess safety tolerability SB-681323 , potent , selective inhibitor p38 alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase . The rationale behind development drug elevate level circulate pro-inflammatory agent , cytokine biological agent increase level inflammation lung . These agent part 'inflammatory loop ' may beneficial condition dampen loop . p38 mitogen activate protein kinase ( MAPK ) play major role regulation activation intracellular protein subsequently involve regulation cytokine . The pathway activate 'stress ' , injury , cause inflammation . Therefore , 'dampening ' system reduce level inflammation . This study investigate anti-inflammatory activity , efficacy ( effectiveness achieving desired effect ) safety SB-681323 . To measure efficacy drug , biomarkers measure . Biomarkers biological agent body effect presence specific injury inflammation directly indirectly link regulatory system event body . They use measure presence severity condition question . This study investigate biomarkers link directly indirectly p38 alpha regulatory mechanism/system . We measure biomarkers serum inflammatory biomarkers , coagulation ( blood clot ) system biomarkers , biomarkers endothelial cell / neutrophil interaction biomarkers lung epithelial cell injury .</detailed_description>
