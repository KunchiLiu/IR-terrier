	<brief_title>Immunogenicity Novel H1N1 Vaccination Among HIV-Infected Compared HIV-Uninfected Persons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator study conduct evaluate compare seroresponses novel H1N1 vaccination among HIV positive negative person receive novel H1N1 vaccination part routine clinical care , secondary objective examine impact prior seasonal vaccination subsequent seroresponse novel H1N1 vaccination , determine potential reaction ( local systemic ) new vaccine among patient , assess potential immunologic/virologic change ( CD4/HIV RNA level ) H1N1 vaccination among HIV patient . Finally , investigator collect data influenza-like illness ( ILI ) H1N1 event study follow-up period influenza isolate cause ILI event genetically characterize .</detailed_description>
