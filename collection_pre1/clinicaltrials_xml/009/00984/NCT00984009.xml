	<detailed_description>Grapefruit juice inhibitor cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 enzyme system , one enzyme system responsible metabolism colchicine . This study evaluate effect multiple daily consumption grapefruit juice pharmacokinetic profile single 0.6 mg dose colchicine . On study Day 1 , fast least 10 hour twenty-two healthy , non-smoking , non-obese , non-pregnant adult volunteer age 18 45 give one dose colchicine ( 1 x 0.6 mg tablet ) . Fasting continue 4 hour dose . Blood sample draw participant dose 24 hour post-dose confined basis time sufficient adequately define pharmacokinetics colchicine . Blood sample continue non-confined basis Days 2-5 . After 14 day washout period , start morning Day 15 continue Day 17 , subject return clinic consumption administer dose grapefruit juice ( 1 x 240 ml ) twice daily . On morning Day 18 fast least 10 hour subject receive co-administered single oral dose colchicine ( 1 x 0.6 mg ) grapefruit juice ( 1 x 240 ml ) . Fasting continue 4 hour dose . Blood sample draw participant dose 24 hour post-dose confined basis time sufficient adequately define pharmacokinetics colchicine presence grapefruit juice . Blood sample continue non-confined basis Days 19-22 . Subjects consume final administer dose grapefruit juice ( 1 x 240 ml ) even Day 18 . A goal study evaluate safety tolerability regimen healthy volunteer . Subjects monitor throughout participation study adverse reaction study drug and/or procedure . Seated blood pressure pulse measure prior dose approximately 1 , 2 , 3 hour follow drug administration Days 1 18 coincide peak plasma concentration colchicine . All adverse event whether elicited query , spontaneously report , observe clinic staff evaluate Investigator report subject 's case report form .</detailed_description>
