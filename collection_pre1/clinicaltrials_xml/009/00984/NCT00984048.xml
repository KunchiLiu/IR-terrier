	<brief_summary>This multicenter translational study understand therapeutic resistance patient undergo first-line chemotherapy ( FOLFOX/Avastin , FOLFIRI/Avastin ) metastatic colorectal cancer . Tissue sample liver metastasis collect banked start chemotherapy time progression . Additionally , blood sample draw monthly store tissue biobank .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Identify Mechanisms Resistance Standard Therapy Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The major obstacle cure cancer pharmacological agent resistance agent . Clinical response metastatic cancer advance chemotherapeutic agent usually range 15 40 % , indicate intrinsic resistance , acquire resistance occur almost inevitably tumor respond . In patient metastatic colorectal cancer , clinical resistance particular treatment clear endpoint ( tumor growth ) , usually observe within 6-12 month give therapy . Thus , drug resistance select appropriate therapeutic alternative drug-resistant cancer remain major dilemma oncologist . The current first-line treatment metastatic colorectal cancer Quebec much North America combination call FOLFOX ( fluoro-pyrimidine 5-FU give 46-hour infusion , folinic acid oxaliplatin ) combination bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) . An alternative regimen cytotoxic drug , also use Avastin® , FOLFIRI , simply replace oxaliplatin topoisomerase inhibitor irinotecan . In metastatic setting , study demonstrate significant difference two regimen , decision-making lack definitive tool . The objective study identify , clinical sample , molecular signature clinically resistant colorectal cancer ( CRC ) patient current commonly use therapeutic agent . The goal study two-fold . First , build biobank blood tissue specimen , prior start chemotherapy determine time-point ( progression disease ) , patient undergo standard well establish first-line treatment ( FOLFOX/bevacizumab FOLFIRI/bevacizumab ) metastatic colorectal cancer . Second , use state-of-the-art approach various collaborate laboratory correlate clinical outcome molecular event use predict circumscribe chemoresistance .</detailed_description>
