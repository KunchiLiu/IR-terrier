	<brief_summary>Background : - The influenza A virus cause infection lead fever , cough , muscle ache , diarrhea , headache , even fatal people . Seasonal influenza kill estimate 36,000 people United States year . In addition , 200,000 people hospitalize flu-related complication . Influenza A substantial health effect every age group . - Currently , treatment available influenza A , concern rate complication even death infection still high despite treatment , time virus may become resistant treatment . Researchers interested develop possible new treatment use antibody influenza A virus . Objectives : - To collect plasma ( liquid component blood contain antibody ) people high level antibody influenza A virus either previously infect virus vaccinate infection . Eligibility : - Healthy male volunteer 18 60 year age eligible donate blood . - Individuals must previously either recovered influenza infection vaccinate infection , may subject restriction participate National Institutes Health research study . Design : - Volunteers undergo apheresis , outpatient procedure researcher collect plasma contain antibody influenza virus draw blood special machine separate blood cell liquid portion sterile condition return blood cell donor . - Volunteers screen blood test ensure eligible participate donate blood . - Volunteers ask undergo least 3 session apheresis ; willing , volunteer participate 20 session . - After plasma collect , tested ensure use safely develop treatment patient influenza A infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Collection Anti-Influenza A Immune Plasma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two type influenza A widely circulate human cause seasonal outbreak epidemic - H1N1 ( swine flu ) H3N2 ( subtype abundant seasonal influenza ) . During 2009-2010 influenza season , commonly report virus influenza A ( H1N1 ) . However , 2010-2011 influenza season , commonly report virus influenza A ( H3N2 ) , influenza A ( H1N1 ) viruses influenza B virus circulate well . A certain age group may hit hard one type influenza virus another ( example , 2009 H1N1 virus disproportionately affected people younger 65 year age rather old 65 , whereas H3N2 virus often affect old 65 year ) . However , influenza A substantial health effect every age group . Due limit therapeutic option influenza significant morbidity mortality despite treatment , additional therapeutic warrant . One potential therapeutic fairly rapidly available use anti-influenza A immune plasma immunotherapy . The objective protocol collection anti-influenza A immune plasma male volunteer meet criterion use human plasma therapy study . The use plasma male donor minimize risk transfusion relate acute lung injury ( TRALI ) , associate antibody ( likely generate pregnancy ) find female plasma . For reason , male donor enrol . This protocol administer investigational product , rather collect plasma subject high anti-influenza A antibody titer ( convalescent survivor influenza infection recipient license influenza vaccine ) . Following screen potential subject identify eligible participate plasma donation determine likelihood antibody influenza A ( H1N1 H3N2 ) recent infection immunization , enrol subject receive baseline physical laboratory examination . Eligible subject high influenza A hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) titer schedule least 3 ( 20 ) plasma collection session . Following test collect plasma potential pathogen , may use therapeutic plasma , and/or may use manufacturing high titer anti-influenza A intravenous immune globulin ( IVIG ) . Both option would support clinical trial aim develop additional therapeutic influenza infection .</detailed_description>
