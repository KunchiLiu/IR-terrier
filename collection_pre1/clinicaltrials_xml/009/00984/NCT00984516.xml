	<brief_title>Investigation Into Safety Scar-improvement Efficacy Intradermal Juvidex Dosed Once Three Times</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects randomise three dose group equal size . The three dose group 100mM ( 2.82mg/100μl ) , 200mM ( 5.64mg/100μl ) 400mM ( 11.28mg/100μl ) . Before wounding , three prospective wound sit 1cm long mark upper , inner aspect arm ( anterior , posterior distal ) give three pair wound . Wounds assign Pair 1 ( leave distal right distal ) , Pair 2 ( leave anterior left posterior ) Pair 3 ( right anterior right posterior ) . Sites anaesthetise use 1 % plain lignocaine , prior wound one site pair , randomly assign , receive intradermal injection Juvidex ( 100μl ) opposite site pair receive intradermal injection Placebo ( 100μl ) . Within dose group , subject randomise two subgroup similar size . Subgroup A received one dose wound pair 1 2 ; three dos wind pair 3 . Subgroup B receive three dos wind pair 1 2 ; one dose wound pair 3 . Incision site randomise receive three injection study medication re-dosed 100μl per wound margin ( 200μl per site ) 3 hour receive first dose dosed way Day 5 . Subjects attend follow-up visit Day 14 . Scars assess monthly Month 1 Month 12 . At Month 12 , Investigator excise distal scar subject histological examination . Posttrial follow-up visit schedule Months 18 24 .</detailed_description>
