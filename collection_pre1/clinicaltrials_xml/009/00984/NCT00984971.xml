	<brief_summary>To date , majority microbicide research focus assessment safety effectiveness vaginal microbicides use prevention HIV transmission via vaginal compartment . Receptive anal intercourse ( RAI ) common among men sex men ( MSM ) , increase evidence heterosexual woman develop develop world also practice anal sex . It , therefore , anticipate vaginal microbicides license , use vaginal rectal compartment . As consequence , need evaluate rectal vaginal safety profile candidate microbicides . Therefore , primary objective study evaluate systemic safety 1 % vaginally formulate tenofovir gel apply rectally . In addition , study evaluate immunotoxicity gel evaluate acceptability ; also use oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablet ( TDF ) , rectally-applied tenofovir gel , placebo gel compare systemic compartmental pharmacokinetic ( pK ) profile . This study design address follow hypothesis : - Vaginally-formulated tenofovir 1 % topical gel apply rectally safe use combination clinical laboratory marker include assay specifically design measure mucosal toxicity - Tenofovir detectable different concentration various anatomic compartment sample pharmacokinetics follow single 7-day topical exposure - Exposure tenofovir 1 % gel demonstrate prevention ex vivo HIV-1 challenge use vivo drug-exposed tissue compare baseline tissue sample - Orally deliver , single dose , 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablet similar safety profile use routine blood safety index establish trial show mucosal safety concern - The oral dose different multi-compartment concentration kinetics topical tenofovir also demonstrate preliminary ( ex vivo ) prevention use explant infectivity assay - Vaginally formulate tenofovir 1 % topical gel apply rectally acceptable participant , indicate score upper one third 10-point Likert scale intentionality use product future</brief_summary>
