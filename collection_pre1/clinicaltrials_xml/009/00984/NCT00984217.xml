	<brief_summary>Standard therapy high-risk locally advanced salivary gland malignancy surgery follow postoperative radiation therapy . Retrospective study show superiority combine modality therapy compare surgery alone patient advance T N stage . Despite addition postoperative radiation therapy , five-year survival locally advance salivary gland malignancy poor ( less 60 % ) . In salivary gland malignancy , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) express 25-85 % ; certain histological type , like salivary duct carcinoma , expression high . EGFR promise target anticancer therapy . In squamous cell carcinoma head neck , phase III trial utilize cetuximab add radiation therapy improve locoregional control overall survival compare radiation alone . Panitumumab novel , human , IgG2 EGFR monoclonal antibody may better tolerate efficacious cetuximab . Here , investigator suggest addition panitumumab standard radiotherapy locally-advanced salivary gland malignancy improve recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Pathologically determine salivary gland cancer major minor salivary gland head neck ( histology ) status post potentially curative surgical resection macroscopic residual disease . Patients AJCC 6th edition stage III : 1. extracapsular extension , 2. perineural invasion , 3. positive surgical margin 4. high grade histology ( i.e. , high grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma , adenocarcinoma except basal cell adenocarcinoma , salivary duct carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , adenoid cystic carcinoma ) stage IVA IVB . No distant metastasis . No prior chemotherapy , biologic/targeted therapy ( include prior therapy specifically directly target EGFR pathway ) , radiotherapy head neck cancer . No 10 week ( minimum 3 week ) elapse surgery treatment study . ECOG performance status 02 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count : Greater equal 1500/uL Platelets : Greater equal 100,000/uL Hemoglobin : Greater equal 10g/dL Total bilirubin : &lt; 1.5x normal institutional limit Creatinine clearance : &gt; 45 mL/min Magnesium level : &gt; low limit normal No prior invasive malignancy unless diseasefree survival 3 year . Age great equal 18 year Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude ( see exclusion criterion ) . Informed consent must obtain patient prior begin therapy . Patients ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Significant history uncontrolled cardiac disease ; i.e. , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , recent myocardial infarction ( within prior 6 month ) , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy decrease ejection fraction . All patient baseline EKG . If abnormality consistent active coronary artery disease detect , patient refer cardiologist appropriate evaluation management prior treatment study . Patients may receive investigational agent . No history prior malignancy , exception basal carcinoma skin situ cervical cancer , malignancy treat curative intent 3year diseasefree survival . Pregnant woman exclude study chemotherapy radiation therapy potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother chemotherapy , breastfeed discontinue mother treated chemotherapy . Prior study enrollment , woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must advise importance avoid pregnancy trial participation potential risk factor unintentional pregnancy . In addition , men enrol study understand risk sexual partner childbearing potential practice effective method birth control . All WOCBP MUST negative urine pregnancy test baseline , within 7 day prior receive investigational product . The minimum sensitivity pregnancy test must 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG . If urine pregnancy test positive , serum pregnancy test perform confirm result . In event urine serum pregnancy test positive , subject must receive investigational product must enrol study . In addition , WOCBP instruct contact Investigator immediately suspect might pregnant ( e.g. , miss late menstrual period ) time study participation . The Investigator must immediately notify Amgen event confirm pregnancy patient participate study . Prior severe infusion reaction human monoclonal antibody . Prior radiotherapy , chemotherapy EGFR inhibitor head neck cancer .</criteria>
