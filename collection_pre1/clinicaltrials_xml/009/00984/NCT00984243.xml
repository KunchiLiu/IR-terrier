	<brief_summary>This study do determine whether substance call hematoporphyrin use treat tumor various location body use association laser . Hematoporphyrin substance take cancerous cell . When cell expose energy emit laser source , chemical reaction occur cell cause cell die . It hop treatment method may able selectively destroy malignant cell without damage surround healthy tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung cancer currently lead cause death woman men United States continue major problem several country world . Detection , localization , surgical treatment early stage , provide best opportunity long-term survival patient non-sma11 cell lung cancer time . Studies examine utility screening patient high risk lung cancer sputum cytology chest roentgenogram show , despite high frequency detect resect early cancer screen group , difference screen group control group overall cancer mortality . The purpose study determine photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) alternative surgical resection patient early stage ) roentgenographically occult squamous cell carcinoma lung candidate surgery . If PDT successful , would remove indication surgery eliminate need operation . The specific goal evaluate impact PDT patient determine percentage patient spar surgery wel1 follow : morbidity , overall mortality , lung cancer mortality , rate subsequent lung cancer , relative cost PDT surgery , change pulmonary function time , effect quality life , patient preference PDT surgery .</detailed_description>

Occult lung cancer chest roentgenogram CT scan If CT scan abnormal , mediastinoscopy negative . Cancer bronchoscopically superficial defined section IV , E. Estimated size le 1 cm diameter surface bronchus surface area 0.7 1.0 cm2 . Location trachea , main stem bronChi , lobar bronchus , segmental bronchus , subsegmental bronchus . Medical condition permit surgery : cardiovascular status satisfactory operation postoperative FEVl predict great 0.75 liter . Patients complete quality life questionnaire spirometry include force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEVl ) force vital capacity ( FVC ) . On bronchoscopic biopsy , carcinoma entirely situ show 2 mm microinvasion . The characteristic mucosa . may include paleness , opacity , loss luster , roughness , microgranularity . The mucosal fold may demonstrate lack clarity . thickening , disappearance . There may small nodular protrusion tumor lumen The peripheral extent tumor invasion confirm endoscopically . A medical disease exclude surgery option A postoperative FEVl predict less 0.75 liter A previous carcinoma malignancy curatively treat The presence simultaneous lung cancer CT scan chest show thicken bronchial wall extension beyond bronchial wall area cancer</criteria>
