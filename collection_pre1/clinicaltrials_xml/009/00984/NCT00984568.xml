	<brief_summary>This study perform compare efficacy safety classical `` Step-Up '' approach treatment moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis use oral prednisolone + oral 5-aminosalicylic acid ( 5-ASA ) oral prednisolone + oral azathioprine ( AZA ) intensive early `` Top-Hold '' approach intravenous infliximab ( 5 mg/kg ) administer Weeks 0 , 2 , 6 8 week thereafter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conventional Step-Up Versus Infliximab Monotherapy Patients With Ulcerative Colitis ( P05553 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants randomize receive either intravenous ( IV ) infliximab monotherapy ( Top-Hold approach ) start dose 5 mg/kg Weeks 0 , 2 , 6 thereafter every 8 week Level 1 , classical Step-Up treatment start oral prednisolone ( 40 mg/day least 3 day 2 week follow 1 mg/kg/day minimum 7 day 2 week case participant show improvement clinical symptom 40 mg/day treatment ) + oral 5-aminosalicylic acid ( 5-ASA ) dose 2 g/day Level 1 . Participants receive Step-Up treatment achieve adequate response first 4 week prednisolone treatment directly enter Level 3 treatment endoscopy perform confirm treatment eligibility . Furthermore , participant achieve response Week 4 also directly enter Level 3 switch treatment IV infliximab . If participant experience first flare initial response , participant Step-Up group start prednisolone treatment last effective dose ( i.e. , participant previously respond prednisolone 40 mg/day receive dose 40 mg/day least 3 day 2 week ; participant previously respond prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day receive dose 1 mg/kg/day minimum 7 day 2 week ) . If last effective dose 40 mg/day participant respond within 14 day , dose adjust 1 mg/kg/day minimum 7 day 2 week . In case participant respond prednisolone ( i.e. , return individual baseline partial Mayo score obtain study Week 4 ) , participant enter Level 3 receive treatment IV infliximab . If participant experience second flare initial response Week 4 ( Level 1 ) , participant enter treatment Level 2 . In Level 2 , participant receive prednisolone induction effective dose previously use Level 1 + maintenance treatment oral azathioprine ( AZA ) dose 2.0-2.5 mg/kg/day . Participants respond treatment Level 2 develop flare initial response Level 2 enter Level 3 receive treatment IV infliximab follow endoscopy confirm treatment eligibility . If time treatment , participant become prednisolone dependent ( i.e. , flare taper phase prednisolone ) , participant enter Level 3 treatment IV infliximab . Participants Level 1 Top-Hold treatment group ( IV infliximab Week 0 , 2 , 6 every 8 week thereafter ) achieve response Week 4 receive IV infliximab 5 mg/kg reduce interval 4 week ( Level 2 ) start Week 10 infusion . Participants suffer flare initial response Level 1 switch Level 2 . Participants respond treatment reduce interval 3 infusion ( 12 week ) , develop flare initial response Level 2 , switch treatment oral prednisolone + AZA ( Level 3 ) follow colonoscopy confirm eligibility . When participant responds treatment IV infliximab Level 2 , return treatment IV infliximab every 8 week response achieve 3 consecutive visit .</detailed_description>
