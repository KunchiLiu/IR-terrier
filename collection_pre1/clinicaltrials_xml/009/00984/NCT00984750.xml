	<brief_summary>Decreased insulin sensitivity ( insulin resistance ) major risk factor type 2 diabetes mellitus renal cardiovascular disease . It key component , possibly , pathogenetic factor metabolic syndrome - cluster arterial hypertension , obesity , impair glucose tolerance , dyslipidemia , coagulation abnormality , albuminuria increase cardiovascular risk - may precede accompany type 2 diabetes . Insulin function abnormality associate insulin resistance , may major role prevent type 2 diabetes , long-term , diabetes micro- macrovascular complication . Carnitine involved lipid carbohydrate metabolism acetyl-L-carnitine ( ALC ) , intramitochondrial carrier acylic group , may modulate cell fuel substrate utilization . Studies find carnitine may improve insulin sensitivity glucose disposal healthy subject patient type 2 diabetes . A recent study find prim constant infusion acetyl-L-carnitine ( ALC ) may increase glucose utilization type 2 diabetic patient , possibly restore glycogen synthase activity . In previous pilot study healthy subject decrease insulin sensitivity , investigator find 6-month treatment Acetyl-L-Carnitine - ester l-carnitine - improve glucose disposal rate , take marker insulin sensitivity . Amelioration insulin sensitivity associate significant clinically relevant reduction systolic blood pressure without appreciable change diastolic blood pressure . Whether blood pressure reduction reflect amelioration insulin sensitivity , rather , direct , specific effect Acetyl-L-Carnitine still unknown.The antihypertensive effect ensue progressively slowly wan treatment withdrawal document slow progressive increase blood pressure level toward baseline level recovery period . This finding provide convincing evidence blood pressure reduction throughout observation period explain `` trial effect '' , reflect true treatment effect . Blood pressure secondary efficacy variable study mechanism underlie antihypertensive effect Acetyl-L-Carnitine ( reduce peripheral resistance , decrease cardiac output , increase artery compliance and/or enhance sodium excretion ) , population assess . Acetyl-L-Carnitine well tolerate patient may provide novel therapeutic tool treatment arterial hypertension , dyslipidemia could safely used people type 2 diabetes . Thus , investigator design prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial investigate whether Acetyl-L-Carnitine added-on stable standardize blood pressure lipid lower therapy may help improve control hypertension dyslipidemia , therefore , decrease overall cardiovascular risk hypertensive patient type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Arterial hypertension , particular systolic hypertension , common component metabolic syndrome , syndrome hypertension , abdominal obesity , dyslipidemia , impair glucose tolerance increase urinary albumin excretion sustain decreased tissue sensitivity insulin ( insulin resistance ) . It affect 80 90 % people type 2 diabetes strongest risk factor macrovascular microvascular complication diabetes , myocardial infarction , stroke , peripheral artery disease , nephropathy retinopathy . Despite multi-drug therapy , reduction systolic blood pressure normal range seldom achievable people type 2 diabetes . Moreover , due increase vascular stiffness , reduce systolic blood pressure may decrease diastolic blood pressure extent diastolic myocardial perfusion impair risk ischemic event increase . Thus , availability drug may help control systolic hypertension without appreciably affect diastolic blood pressure would major clinical implication . In addition arterial hypertension , dyslipidemia also component metabolic syndrome almost invariably observed people type 2 diabetes remarkably contribute excess cardiovascular risk population . HMGCoA inhibition statin therapy , significantly ameliorate hypercholesterolemia , marginally affect concomitant hypertriglyceridemia ( probably typical feature increase insulin resistance ) fail significantly reduce circulate level serum lipoprotein ( ) , one strong predictor coronary cerebrovascular event type 2 diabetic . Thus , availability drug may help achieve effective amelioration dyslipidemia population might also important clinical implication . In ongoing study healthy subject decrease insulin sensitivity , find 6-month treatment acetylcarnitine - ester l-carnitine - improve glucose disposal rate , take marker insulin sensitivity . Amelioration insulin sensitivity associate significant clinically relevant reduction systolic blood pressure without appreciable change diastolic blood pressure . Whether blood pressure reduction reflect amelioration insulin sensitivity , rather , direct , specific effect acetylcarnitine still unknown . Previous study also find L-carnitine add background simvastatin therapy , marginally affect serum cholesterol , remarkably reduce serum triglyceride lipoprotein ( ) level . Whether amelioration insulin resistance may explain least part effect unclear . Finally , available clinical study consistently show acetyl carnitine well tolerate drug safely use human . Experimental evidence also available l-carnitine may improve statin-associated myotoxicity . AIMS Primary To asses effect 6-month therapy acetylcarnitine compare placebo systolic blood pressure 228 patient type 2 diabetes , arterial hypertension dyslipidemia stable background antihypertensive , hypoglycemic , lipid lower therapy . Secondary A.To ass effect treatment : - diastolic pulse pressure - serum triglyceride apolipoprotein ( ) - HOMA index ( calculate data analysis ) , serum insulin , leptin , adiponectin ( pending finding efficacy variable ) - blood glucose , serum cholesterol ( total , HDL LDL ) , non-esterified fatty acid ( NEFA ) , lipoproteins A uric acid - 2-hours post oral load blood glucose profile - high density C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) - urinary albumin excretion estimate creatinine clearance ( calculate data analysis ) - cardiac output , peripheral resistance large artery compliance ( assessed echocardiography representative subgroup ) - 24 hour sodium excretion sodium fractional clearance , representative subgroup - need concomitant therapy antihypertensive , hypoglycemic , lipid lower agent B.To ass whether observed change systolic , diastolic pulse pressure lipid metabolic profile correlate concomitant change marker insulin sensitivity . C.To monitor systolic/diastolic blood pressure clinical/laboratory parameter evaluate study two month Acetyl-L-Carnitine therapy Placebo withdrawal patient complete study maintain background medication . DESIGN The study prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter trial .</detailed_description>
