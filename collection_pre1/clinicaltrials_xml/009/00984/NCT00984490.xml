	<brief_title>Metformin Hydrochloride Treating Women With Stage I Stage II Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine situ effect metformin hydrochloride proliferation ( Ki67 ) apoptosis ( caspase-3 ) woman operable stage I II breast cancer . Secondary - To determine situ biologic effect metformin hydrochloride AMP kinase , MTOR/PI3K , IGF pathways breast cancer ( tissue S6K phospho S6K , p53 , p63 , p73 level well p53 [ ( Ser-15 ) , wild-type p53 present ] , p63 [ Ser-66/68 , Ser-301 , Ser-361 ] , p73 [ Y-99 ] phosphorylation , PTEN [ clone 6H2.1 ] , phospho-Akt [ S473 ] , insulin receptor substrate 1 2 [ IRS-1 IRS-2 ] , LKB1 ) . - To determine molecular classification ( basal-type v luminal A vs luminal B ) establish p63 p73 RNA microarray gene signature correlate metformin hydrochloride-induced effect proliferation ( Ki67 ) , apoptosis ( caspase-3 ) select biomarkers ( list ) breast cancer . - To collect analyze pre- post-treatment peripheral blood specimen serum glucose insulin level , well circulate IGF-1 IGF bind protein 3 ( IGFBP3 ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral metformin hydrochloride twice daily 7-21 day . Approximately 24-36 hour last dose metformin hydrochloride , patient undergo surgical resection ( total mastectomy segmental resection lymph node evaluation ) tumor . Patients undergo blood tissue sample collection periodically biomarker analysis .</detailed_description>
