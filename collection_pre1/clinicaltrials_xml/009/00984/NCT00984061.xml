	<detailed_description>Clarithromycin potent inhibitor activity cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) . CYP 3A4 play role metabolism colchicine P-gp responsible efflux colchicine across membrane . This open-label , one sequence , two-period , drug-drug interaction study evaluate effect clarithromycin-related inhibition CYP 3A4 P-gp colchicine pharmacokinetics 24 healthy , non-smoking , non-obese ( within +/- 15 % ideal body weight ) , male female adult volunteer . The safety tolerability concurrent administration clarithromycin single dose colchicine also evaluate . During first period , subject confine study unit begin afternoon day prior schedule dosing ( Day -1 ) . On morning Day 1 , overnight fast least 10 hour , subject administer single dose colchicine 0.6 mg tablet 240 ml room temperature water . Blood drawn time sufficient characterize baseline pharmacokinetics group . Following 20 day washout period Day 22 , subject return clinic receive supply clarithromycin 250 mg tablet , take outpatient basis twice daily ( 8 a.m. 8 p.m. ) without regard meal total 14 dos . Clinic staff make telephone contact daily subject course confirm compliance clarithromycin dose regimen , monitor adverse event use concomitant medication . On day 28 afternoon , subject confine study unit . On morning day 29 , overnight fast least 10 hour subject administer single dose colchicine 0.6 mg final dose clarithromycin 240 ml water . Blood sample draw time sufficient determine pharmacokinetic profile colchicine presence clarithromycin steady state . The pharmacokinetic profile compare determine extent drug-drug interaction .</detailed_description>
