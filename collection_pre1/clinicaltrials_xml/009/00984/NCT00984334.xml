	<detailed_description>Naloxone use many year IV IM injection reversal opioid effect ( follow opioid overdose ) evaluate oral formulation manage opioid-induced constipation . Immediate release oral naloxone preparation however lead reversal opioid effect withdrawal . This initiated development prolong ( slow release ) naloxone preparation prevent systemic level naloxone reach level central opioid effect may reverse . Naloxone high first pas metabolism ( 98 % ) short half life ( ~1hr ) .
