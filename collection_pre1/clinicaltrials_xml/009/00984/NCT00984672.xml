	<brief_summary>Clinician direct use bone morphogenetic protein ( BMPs ) way FDA approve , increase recently due morbidity associate harvest iliac crest bone graft spinal arthrodesis procedure . FDA approve use anterior lumbar fusion LT Cage , clinical application proteins become widely adopt due effectiveness form bone facilitate fusion . Clinicians realized protein potent stimulators bone formation anecdotal report increase rate radicular pain postoperative period use interbody arthrodesis procedure . Speculation mechanism radiculitis postulate due inflammatory effect protein . Excess bone overgrowth around spinal nerve proximity fusion cage report . No prospective study perform assess incidence etiology complication . The investigator propose prospective study evaluate incidence complication well postoperative imaging study help determine whether bony overgrowth indeed occur adjacent effect spinal nerve .</brief_summary>
