	<brief_title>Study REOLYSIN® Combination With Paclitaxel Carboplatin Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cutaneous melanoma one rapidly increase cancer US around world increase incidence 3-7 % per year fair-skinned Caucasian population . An estimated 62,480 case invasive melanoma diagnose US 2008 estimate 8,420 death . An additional 46,170 case melanoma situ predict . Melanoma spread distant site ( stage IV ) rarely curable . This Phase 2 study design characterize efficacy safety REOLYSIN give intravenously combination paclitaxel carboplatin every 3 week patient metastatic melanoma . Response primary endpoint trial . Patients may continue receive chemotherapy combination REOLYSIN 8 cycle may continue indefinitely REOLYSIN monotherapy protocol , provide experience either progressive disease unacceptable drug-related toxicity respond either supportive care dose reduction .</detailed_description>
