	<brief_summary>Background : - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allotransplant ) use treat many kind cancer develop cell blood immune system . After allotransplant , donor cell take production recipient blood immune cell , donor immune cell directly attack control tumor . However , cancer respond allotransplant , proven cure . - A single treatment radiation improve potency immune-cell therapy . This probably tumor tissue damage way new tumor protein expose , attract immune cell tumor . By give single dose radiation , immune cell attract tumor allow survive function usual way , travel throughout body educate immune cell recognize tumor , activate expand order kill tumor cell . Some research show radiation may widespread effect stimulate immune system , educate immune cell recognize control tumor radiate . Objectives : - To determine whether single treatment radiation help donor immune cell control cancer allotransplant without cause excessive side effect . Eligibility : - Recipients : Individuals 18 year age old blood cancer respond allotransplant . - Donors : Healthy individual 18 year age older previous allotransplant donor one study recipient . Design : - Donors provide additional blood immune cell , call lymphocyte , apheresis . Apheresis involve draw blood , separate lymphocyte , return rest blood donor . - Recipients receive single dose radiation great amount tumor irradiate safely . Researchers intentionally leave tumor radiate order evaluate whether widespread response treatment . - There two treatment arm study . - Arm 1 : Study participant donor lymphocytes available major complication allotransplant give dose donor cell receive radiation , provide additional boost donor immune response . - Arm 2 : Study participant receive donor lymphocyte donor available , receive allotransplant partially match relative , significant complication allotransplant - receive radiation without additional donor lymphocyte . - All recipient follow closely side effect tumor response radiation without donor lymphocyte . Additional test perform , include tumor biopsy , bone marrow sample , blood draw , order study immune effect radiation donor lymphocytes . - A separate , control group allotransplant recipient receive radiation . This group include participant whose transplant doctor plan use donor lymphocyte therapy alone control cancer progression . This group donate blood immune cell blood draws apheresis . These cell examine study immune effect receive donor lymphocyte without radiation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Radiation-Enhanced Allogeneic Cell Therapy Progressive Hematologic Malignancy After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - The prognosis patient cancer relapse progressive disease allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allotransplant ) poor . Effective therapy patient fail withdrawal immune suppression administration donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) identify . - Increasing efficacy allotransplant without increase toxicity major goal transplantation research . A major research effort within Experimental Transplantation Immunobiology Branch ( ETIB ) identify way build allogeneic platform treat relapse allotransplant . - We hypothesize single fraction radiation tumor prior administration donor lymphocytes increase potency systemic graft-versus-tumor ( GVT ) effect without increase graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . Objectives : - To determine safety , relation GVHD allograft function , efficacy , term systemic tumor response , administer single-fraction , target radiotherapy without DLI patient persistent tumor allotransplant . Eligibility : - Adults hematologic malignancy progress recur allotransplant , successful donor T cell engraftment , trial withdrawal immune suppression . - Disease amenable radiation well additional measurable disease outside radiation field . - Subjects treatment-refractory acute chronic GVHD eligible . Design : - Subjects receive radiation single , 8-Gy fraction sit disease . At least one site measurable disease remain untreated radiation evaluation systemic response . - There two arm . Arm A include subject available donor lymphocyte GVHD require systemic treatment ; shall receive DLI day completion radiation . Arm B include previously require systemic therapy GVHD , high risk significant GVHD , and/or available donor lymphocyte ; shall receive radiation without DLI . - Additional disease outside field radiation monitor systemic effect therapy . - Subjects monitor outpatient basis development exacerbation GVHD , excessive hematologic toxicity toxicity radiation , tumor response least 60 day . - Enrollment : - Treatment Subjects : The protocol treat 21 subject per arm ( total 42 ) . There stop rule 8 15 patient per arm excessive GVHD radiation toxicity . - DLI Control Subjects ; 15 control subject receive DLI persistent disease part care another National Institutes Health ( NIH ) protocol , include compare immunologic effect radiation follow DLI ( Arm A ) DLI alone . - Donor Subjects : Related donor Arm A Treatment Subjects DLI Control Subjects enrol collection clinical DLI product , portion use research ( 36 Donor Subjects ) .</detailed_description>
