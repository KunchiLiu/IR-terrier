	<detailed_description>Introduction : Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES ) describe new field investigational surgery use endoscope primary operative tool . The insertion sit endoscope include natural orifice mouth , anus , vagina , urethra . Multiple animal study utilize similar technique ongoing several institution , include Baystate Medical Center . These multidisciplinary team consist surgeon gastroenterologist collaborate develop safe effective surgical technique via natural orifice route order avoid surgical incision . The NOTES team Baystate begin animal study May , 2006 . Multiple procedure , include limited uterine horn resection ( simulate appendectomy ) , cholecystectomy , nephrectomy , splenectomy , distal pancreatectomy , small bowel resection , mediastinal exploration , sleeve gastrectomy complete successfully team . This work lead separate , IRB-approved protocol perform NOTES pancreatic pseudocystgastrostomy human patient . To date , 2 patient successfully undergo entirely transluminal , endoscopic cystgastrostomy third case upcoming . The focus much research ( well many investigator ) , develop secure closure method stomach . Unfortunately , key scientific question remain regard technique thus limited human trial date . Given , begin explore access technique . Gynecologists long consider transvaginal access peritoneum safe route entry abdomen . Transvaginal hysterectomy transvaginal tubal ligation indeed become regular part gynecologic armamentarium . NOTES surgeon learn access approach begin employ safe route abdomen . In fact , investigator New York1,2 ; San Diego3 ; Strasbourg , France4 ; Mallorca , Spain5 ; Hamburg , Germany6 , Milan , Italy7 ; Rio de Janeiro8,9 SÃ£o Paulo10 , Brazil announce transvaginal NOTES procedure involve gallbladder . All approach , date , utilized one laparoscopic trocars safety reason . Primary Objective : The primary objective pilot study demonstrate Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES ) transvaginal cholecystectomy technique safe effective standard laparoscopic surgical technique resection gallbladder . Hypothesis : Patients undergo Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery treatment gallbladder disease experience effective treatment less discomfort quicker recovery standard surgical technique . Introduction : The NOTES team ( surgeon gastroenterologist ) Baystate extensive experience animal work develop novel technique commercially available product . Despite perform cholecystectomy porcine model transgastric transvaginal approach , yet perform human case . The surgeon team perform well thousand laparoscopic cholecystectomy ; gastroenterologist recognize advanced therapeutic endoscopist ; gynecologist expert transvaginal surgery . We believe combination human experience animal research lead safe attempt perform procedure describe herein . Methods : There total 3 patient undergoing experimental surgical procedure meeting entry criterion subsequent obtain informed consent These patient recruit Baystate ambulatory surgery clinics.. Preoperative laboratory testing , blood work ( liver function test , amylase lipase , white blood cell count , pregnancy test ) , well ultrasound liver document gallbladder disease perform standard patient undergoing surgical removal gallbladder . In procedure , induction general anesthesia creation culdotomy , sterile endoscope would insert vagina abdomen . Following insertion endoscope , retraction stitch pass abdominal wall gallbladder retract fundus gallbladder cephalad direction . A 5-mm trocar place umbilicus serve two function : one , allow laparoscope case view becomes compromise substandard ; two , allow clip applier place abdomen clip cystic artery cystic duct . Dissection gallbladder commence use endoscopic tool removal specimen directly culdotomy vagina . Utilizing technique , many three surgical incision avoid . Postoperatively , patient keep hospital overnight . After discharge , follow-up examination conduct 3-5 day ( telephone ) , 1 week , 6 week follow procedure determine success procedure . Longer term follow-up determine patient 's overall condition . For least first 3 procedure , laparoscopic camera available sterile field least one laparoscopic trocar employ . As operation , would revert next least invasive modality patient safety and/or degree difficulty dictate . In case , encounter difficulty transvaginal cholecystectomy , would low threshold revert laparoscopic cholecystectomy even open cholecystectomy need . Safety Monitoring : Due novelty procedure , safety information monitor continuous basis . Complications deviate expect outcomes standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy would result , study terminate prematurely temporarily suspend ass event . A member general surgery department appoint safety monitor review case report IRB first third case . Risks Benefits : The anticipated risk associate type surgery include : Bleeding , infection , need open surgery , bile leak , bile duct injury , bowel injury . Risks specific transvaginal NOTES approach include infection vagina , dyspareunia . A vaginal incision know adverse effect either fertility subsequent childbirth , even within week procedure . The anticipated benefit include decrease amount pain experience laparoscopic cholecystectomy , well cosmetically acceptable result . Statistics : As purely descriptive study feasibility new technique , specific statistic monitor . Data Storage : The identifiable data collect keep locked filing cabinet primary investigator 's office . Only PI access file . It anticipate similar `` natural orifice-type '' surgery future variety procedure multitude reason ( incision , less pain , less time hospital ) . These surgery first transvaginal cholecystectomy perform world .</detailed_description>
