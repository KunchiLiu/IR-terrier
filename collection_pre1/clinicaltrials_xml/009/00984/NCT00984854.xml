	<brief_title>Investigation Into Safety Intradermal Juvidex ( M6P ) Administered Wounds Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each subject receive total four wound , two 3mm punch biopsy ( least 5cm apart ) upper , inner aspect arm . Subjects serve control , i.e . one punch biopsy Arm 1 receive Juvidex punch biopsy receive Placebo Standard Care .
