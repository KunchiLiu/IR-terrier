	<brief_title>Trial Concerning Frequency Parastomal Hernia With Without Mesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parastomal hernia relatively common troublesome complication patient stoma . The exact incidence know depend definition bulge hernia , well operation examination perform , incidence varies 0-48 % . A parastomal hernia may give patient difficulty appliance leakage . From economical point view stoma require special kind appliance expensive . Theoretically , strengthen abdominal wall mesh primary operation would reduce risk parastomal hernia . Recently present data suggest mesh primary operation really reduce risk develop parastomal hernia . No negative side effect use mesh report study . All early study involve relatively small number patient short time observation , therefore under-dimensioned concern potential negative late side-effects . Complications see study mesh use surgery bowel include fistulas infection among others . To understand mesh primary operation , safe way , reduces risk develop parastomal hernia compare conventional surgery , important perform new prospective randomise multicenter trial . Specific aim : To compare patient colostomy without mesh primary operation . Primary endpoint incidence parastomal hernia require surgery . All patient participate center schedule permanent colostomy , sign inform consent meeting inclusion criterion , randomise formation stoma without mesh . If inclusion criterion fulfil informed consent sign , patient randomise preoperatively .</detailed_description>
