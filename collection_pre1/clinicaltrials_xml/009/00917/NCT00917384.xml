	<brief_title>Study IMC-1121B ( Ramucirumab ) With Best Supportive Care Participants With Gastric Cancer Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Placebo-controlled , multicenter Phase 3 study participant metastatic gastric cancer [ include adenocarcinomas gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) ] disease progression standard first-line chemotherapeutic regimen . Participants randomize 2:1 basis receive best supportive care plus ramucirumab administer every 2 week best supportive care plus placebo administer every 2 week , respectively . Participants undergo radiographic assessment disease status every 6 week . Participant treat evidence progressive disease , toxicity require cessation , withdrawal consent , withdrawal criterion meet . Approximately 348 participant , histologically- cytologically-confirmed , metastatic gastric GEJ adenocarcinoma , radiographically measurable disease define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors evaluable , nonmeasurable disease , randomize . Participants enrol approximately 250 study center North America , South America , Central America , Asia , Australia , New Zealand , Europe .</detailed_description>
