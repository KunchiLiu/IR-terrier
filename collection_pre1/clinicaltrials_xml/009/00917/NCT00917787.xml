	<detailed_description>This cross-sectional study patient asthma healthy control analyze marker inflammation blood induce sputum purpose identify molecular marker specific asthma phenotype . Our specific interest demonstrate periostin level higher normal blood . We already solid preliminary data support hypothesis , goal replicate preliminary finding extend examine characteristic asthma subgroup elevate periostin level . In regard , propose detailed phenotyping asthmatic subject healthy control , include measure induce sputum , exhale air detailed physiologic measure include measure airflow , lung volume , methacholine responsiveness . In early work find periostin marker Th-2 driven asthma , use data collect explore possibility . The biospecimens collect also allow u expand exist plasma , DNA , RNA , sputum sample UCSF Airway tissue bank , continue build resource future research question .</detailed_description>
