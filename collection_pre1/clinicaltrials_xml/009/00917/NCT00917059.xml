	<brief_title>Personalized Indicators Predicting Response SSRI Treatment Major Depression ( The PRISE-MD Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) common psychiatric illness high cost society individual patient . Initial medication treatment MDD often ineffective , precipitate need try medication . This extend suffering , continue functional disability , increase risk relapse risk people abandon treatment . Having biological marker likely treatment effectiveness predict guide clinician ' decision would reduce likelihood people MDD experience unsuccessful treatment . This study test whether quantitative electroencephalogram ( QEEG ) measure take 1 week medication treatment predict effectiveness full treatment regimen depression medication . Participation study last 8 week . At first study visit , participant undergo baseline assessment . These assessment include interview present condition , medical psychiatric history , past current medication treatment ; urine test ; questionnaires depression symptom possible symptom . The study doctor may ask assessment base participant 's individual profile . Participants complete 1-week treatment escitalopram , type antidepressant medication call selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) . At first visit week-long escitalopram treatment , participant undergo electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , measure brain electrical activity . Based certain measurement obtain EEG , antidepressant treatment response ( ATR ) score calculate . Participants divide two treatment group : continue receive escitalopram begin treatment bupropion XL , non-SSRI antidepressant medication . Treatment group last 8 week , time participant attend seven study visit . At study visit , participant ask feeling , side effect , benefit treatment . Further tests—such physical exam , lab test , EEG—may perform study doctor think necessary .</detailed_description>
