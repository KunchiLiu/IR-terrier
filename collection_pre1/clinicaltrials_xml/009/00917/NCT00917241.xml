	<brief_title>Prevention Relapse Graves ' Disease Intrathyroid Injection Dexamethasone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The morbility GD nearly 0.5 % underlying cause 50 80 % case hyperthyroidism.Recently , anti-thyroid drug still main therapy Graves'hyperthyroidism lot district , relapse rate high ( 51~68 % ) withdrawal anti-thyroid treatment.In order reduce relapse rate , study try prescribe replacement thyroxine , either anti-thyroid drug treatment , complete , clear evidence favour give thyroid hormone supplementation follow initial treatment Graves ' thyrotoxicosis anti-thyroid medication . Therefore , optimal medical therapy Graves ' hyperthyroidism remain subject debate . It well known glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory , immunomodulation immunosuppression effect long use treat GO , one effective medicine , decrease cytokine reduce inflammatory status , improve thyroid specific antibody , like thyrotropin receptor antibody ( TRAb ) , antithyroperoxidase antibody ( TPOAb ) antithyroglobulin antibody ( TGAb ) .These study suggest glucocorticoid might affect autoimmune process benefit effect GD . Moreover glucocorticoid use treat GD several early report , serum free triiodothyronine ( FT3 ) thyroxine ( FT4 ) total T3 ( TT3 ) TT4 level decrease 8 day three week treatment glucocorticoid . But study , number select patient small , duration therapy relatively short , might confirm effect glucocorticoids GD .</detailed_description>
