	<brief_summary>Study feasibility different educational modality improve resident handoff patient information b ) Determine whether different educational modality ( powerpoint vs. simulation workshop ) lead improve educational ( surrogate ) clinical outcome 1 . Educate resident content process quality handoff ( Medical Knowledge ) 2 . Educate resident good communication skill ( Communication competency ) 3 . Improve perceived continuity patient care , decrease adverse event relate transfer care . ( Patient safety competency ) 4 . Increase provider ( night resident ) satisfaction continuity care handoff . ( system-based practice/ Practice-based learning )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Innovative Strategies Which Improve Clinical Handoff ( I-SWITCH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomize intern three group . The control group describe . Two group randomize one two intervention : Intervention Group # 1 : focus , interactive power point lecture background , content guideline good handoff ( focus standardize electronic hand-off tool ) . They exercise complete . Intervention Group # 2 : undergo power point lecture ( Group # 1 ) additional intervention focus hand-off tool , standardize hand-off process use OSCE exercise ( objective structure clinical exam ) . This group train effective implementation hand-off tool . They teach standardize hand-off process give opportunity practice peer HFH simulation center . Up 12 resident take pairs practice write verbal handoff skill simulation center peer observation faculty ( investigator , PI ) . Each intern give simulated patient history physical relevant information relate patient 's hospital course . The intern give five minute create handoff . Each pair go separate room record viewed peer instructor . They observe give handoff receive handoff . When exit room , provide feedback one another regard quality handoff . Then peer give additional feedback . Each intern go process give handoff one accepting handoff . After simulation , complete short survey intervention . At completion educational intervention , throughout year part regular intern evaluation , night resident ask weekly basis evaluate efficacy intern handoff . In addition , de-identified write handoff evaluate investigator score completeness accuracy . The resident cross cover blind intern group . They evaluate handoff process . During process , content omission measure , well time take cross cover patient . All intern participate study self-assessment handoff skill . Interns randomize one three group describe undergo educational intervention ( # 1 # 2 ) standard education ( control ) . Educational intervention complete within 10 day start study ( Specific Aims # 1,2 ) . Following intervention intern assess throughout year use standardized grade form evaluate write verbal handoff skill , perceive effectiveness handofffs pertain patient care intern inpatient rotation month ( Specific Aim # 3,4 ) . This complete weekly basis night resident ( second third year resident involve study , blind intervention group ) . Educational endpoint : perceive improvement handoff skill intern involve study 6 month period time compare among intervention group . ( Surrogate ) Clinical Endpoints : 1 ) Objective handoff skill evaluation intern senior resident use standardized grade form 2 ) Review electronic handoff form investigator , form individual intern blind investigator reduce bias</detailed_description>
