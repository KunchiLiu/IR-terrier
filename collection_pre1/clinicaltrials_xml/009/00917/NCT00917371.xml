	<brief_summary>Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) recognize common ( 5-8 % ) , early-onset , long-term impairing , heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorder high heritability . Pharmacotherapy ( methylphenidate atomoxetine ) prove effective treatment ADHD . Gau ( PI ) do extensive research ADHD publish 7 SCI paper ADHD pharmacotherapy . The PI publish first paper effectiveness atomoxetine improve executive function among 30 boy ADHD world ( International Journal Neuropsychopharmacology , 2009 Oct 23:1-14 . [ Epub ] ) . Due lifelong impairment adulthood , adult ADHD drawn much attention Western study past decade ; however , lack information Asian population except PI 's three SCI paper adult ADHD . Because little known atomoxetine effect adult ADHD except symptom reduction , proposal aim investigate efficacy atomoxetine beyond symptoms improvement . The significance project novelty research clinical relevance lack information regard long-term effect atomoxetine neuropsychological brain imaging function adult ADHD , high-prevalent mental disorder long-term impairment adult .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Atomoxetine Brain Imaging , Neuropsychological , Social Functions Adults With Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : 1 . To examine efficacy atomoxetine improve neuropsychological functioning ( CANTAB , Time Perception Tasks ) structural ( DSI ) functional ( rest fMRI ) brain connectivity primary efficacy endpoint . 2 . To examine efficacy atomoxetine reduce ADHD core symptom improve family/social/academic/occupational adjustment quality life . The study design randomize open-label , methylphenidate control trial . The sample consist 60 adult , age 18-50 , clinical diagnosis DSM-IV . All participant randomly assign atomoxetine ( n= 30 ) , methylphenidate ( n= 15 ) , clinical visit psychological counseling ( n=15 ) 8-week randomized clinical trial 3 treatment arm . The measure include psychiatric interview ( ADHD+SADS ) , CGI-ADHD-S , standardize self-reported questionnaire ( AAQoL , WFIRS-S , WFIRS-P social function ; ASRS ADHD symptom ) , neuropsychological test ( CANTAB include attention task , visual memory , executive functioning , gamble test ; Time Perception Task ) , brain imaging ( DSI rest fMRI ) . They reassess safety , ADHD symptoms social functioning/quality life baseline , week 2 ( ± 5 day ) , week 4 ( ± 5 day ) , week 8 ( ± 5 day ) ; neuropsychological test baseline , week 4 ( ± 5 day ) , week 8 ( ± 5 day ) ; brain imaging study ( DSI resting-fMRI ) baseline week 8 ( ± 5 day ) . Additionally , blood sample collect baseline future pharmacogenomic study . We anticipate study one first investigate efficacy atomoxetine neuropsychological functioning , structural functional brain connectivity world . If research carry , first project use brain image assessment tool clinical trial among psychiatric patient psychiatric field Taiwan .</detailed_description>
