	<brief_summary>IBM common acquire muscle disease occur age 50 . The underlying cause remain unknown currently effective treatment . Pathological study reveal abnormal collection protein muscle cell patient IBM . These include protein call phosphorylated tau ( p-tau ) . A similar process appear occur Alzheimer disease , accumulation p-tau develop brain cell . Lithium decrease activity GSK , enzyme key role development p-tau . Lithium GSK inhibitor show decrease accumulation p-tau nerve cell animal model Alzheimer disease . The propose research pilot study see lithium might effective treatment IBM</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trial Status Open Enrollment What Purpose Study ? There currently effective treatment IBM pathogenesis remain uncertain . This study design test hypothesis treatment patient IBM Lithium improve muscle strength reduce marker disease activity believe important disease pathogenesis . Who Eligible Participate ? Patients diagnose Inclusion Body Myositis age 30 adequate muscle function quantitative muscle test FVC &gt; 50 % . Patients uncontrolled diabetes , renal insufficiency , congestive heart failure , cancer , hypothyroidism , current use immunosuppressive medication , currently warfarin know bleed disorder exclude . What involve Study ? This open label trial look effect Li muscle strength . Procedures consist baseline muscle biopsy , blood work , screen procedure . After muscle biopsy patient start Li 300mg/d . Lithium dose dependent tolerability target lithium level . Monthly visit consist EKGs , Li level lab , questionnaire , muscle strength test . At month 6 , patient receive another muscle biopsy . The muscle biopsy perform analyze p-tau level muscle . How long Study ? It approximately 6 month long ; however patient option stay study additional 6 month .</detailed_description>
