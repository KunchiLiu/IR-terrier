	<brief_summary>Previously show Familial Encephalopathy neuroserpin inclusion body ( FENIB ) patient develop abnormality partially overlap Autism Spectrum disorder ( ASD ) , confound additional feature could explain inclusion body formation expect subject inclusion body form SERPINI1 mutation . There described human neuroserpin deficiency phenotype . The neuroserpin knockout mouse phenotype also suggest possible overlap autism . Neuroserpin could contribute directly synapse alter neuron migration early development lead `` underconnectivity '' underlies autism potentially contribute excess short connection enough long one see autistic brain , possibly due imbalance prune neuron synapsis early life . It thus propose sequence neuroserpin gene initially 20 , subsequently 100 idiopathic autistic patient select language impairment perseveration endophenotypes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Neuroserpin Autism Candidate Gene</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It propose perform pilot study ask whether genetic variation SERPINI1 contribute idiopathic autism . To maximize chance find variant , perseveration language delay endophenotypes ( simpler intermediate trait ) use select twenty autistic multiplex ( necessary singleplex ) family idiopathic autistic patient evaluate Autism Diagnostic Interview-revised ( ADI-R ) nuclear family ( sibling parent ) identify Dr. Liptak Dr. Lebel assistance Ms Klausner recruit . Patients syndromic autism due know cause fragile X syndrome , Tuberous sclerosis , Down syndrome , Neurofibromatosis type I exclude . The entire SERPINI1 coding region ( nine exon ) , one kilobase promoter region ( Chen , 2007 ) least 200 bp intron flank exon sequence index case segregation mutation identify investigate within family . All mutation appear good functional candidate compare frequency amongst autistic control population order determine case make SERPINI1 could contribute autism . In addition , know neuroserpin SNPs identify Hapmap project ( www.hapmap.org ) investigate tested evidence transmission distortion/disequilibrium linkage/association analysis . Depending result initial experiment propose subsequently sequence 80 local autism patient ( maximum 100 patient ) . Additional study would perform follow study similarly sequence gene serpins express brain ; Plasminogen activator 1 , PA1 , SERPINE1 locate MLS linkage peak 7q22.1 see IMGSAC study ( Lamb , 2002 ) Proteinase nexin 1 , PN1 SERPINE2 2q36.1 , close previously identify linkage peak ( Autism Genome Project consortium , 2007 ) potentially putative serine protease target ( tPA 8p11.21 uPA 10q22.2 ) upstream neuroserpin activator ( ALK6 , AMH BMP2 ) ( Lebeurrier , 2008 ) . tPA expression increase event require synaptic plasticity ( Yepes , 2002 ) enhance NMDA receptor signal cleavage NR1 subunit ( Pawlack , 2002 ) . All interesting lead pursue obtain additional sample Autism Genetic Resource Exchange ( AGRE ) ( www.agre.org ) , publically available recourse phenotypic data bio-materials provide diagnostic information DNA 100 's multiplex ASD family .</detailed_description>
