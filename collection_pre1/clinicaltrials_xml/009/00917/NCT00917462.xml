	<brief_summary>Sorafenib drug study treatment cancer . Sorafenib show block certain protein surface cancer cell call `` growth factor receptor . '' Blocking growth factor receptor slow stop cancer cell growth . Sorafenib also know Nexavar® . It study type cancer , include kidney cancer , approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat advanced kidney cancer . Because approved FDA treat esophageal cancer , consider experimental treatment . The purpose study determine effect sorafenib advanced esophageal cancer . These effect include whether sorafenib shrink tumor slow growth side effect sorafenib tumor .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically prove cytologically confirm esophageal cancer ( squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma ) adenocarcinoma gastroesophageal ( GE ) junction document MSKCC . Metastatic disease measurable CT MRI scan . Locally recurrent disease amenable potentially curative surgery radiation therapy also allow . Lesions must ≥ 10 mm size . The primary tumor consider measurable disease . Recurrent metastatic lesion within prior radiation field acceptable long disease progress radiation field RECIST criterion . The image modality perform baseline ( CT MRI ) repeat subsequent imaging . Patients allow maximum two prior chemotherapy regimens metastatic disease . Patients allow maximum three prior regimen also previously receive neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy chemoradiotherapy . The last treatment must administer &gt; 3 week prior initiation therapy sorafenib . Pathologic tissue must available immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) stain phosphorylated extracellular signalregulated kinase ( pERK ) . Both patient without pERK stain eligible treatment . Submission slide IHC test pERK may do course therapy require prior protocol therapy . Age ≥ 18 year . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 % . Patients must ability comprehend willingness sign inform consent document . At baseline , patient must normal organ marrow function define : Adequate bone marrow , liver renal function assess follow : Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time ULN ALT AST ≤ 2.5 time ULN ( &lt; = 5 x ULN patient liver involvement ) Creatinine ≤ 1.5 time ULN Patients recover adverse event related therapy administer &gt; 3 week earlier . This include hemoglobin hematologic laboratory criterion . Patients may receive investigational agent . Prior therapy sorafenibrelated compound compound similar biologic chemical component , include compound target VEGF , VEGFR RAF kinase . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , great New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II congestive heart failure , unstable new onset angina pectoris myocardial infarction within past six month , unstable arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation , e.g. , severe schizophrenia , would limit compliance study requirement . Patients chronic arrhythmia , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia , eligible . Uncontrolled hypertension , define systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg , despite optimal medical management . Thrombotic embolic event , include cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack within past six month . Patients prior deep vein thrombose pulmonary embolus stable anticoagulation regimen eligible enrollment . Any factor would significantly interfere inability consume absorb oral medication , e.g . severe nausea/vomiting controlled aggressive antiemetic regimen , grade 3/4 dysphagia , extensive small bowel resection active inflammatory bowel disease lead chronic malabsorption . Patients enteral feed tube eligible sorafenib crush . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection chronic Hepatitis B C infection . Patients concurrent disease , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate participation study . Patients take St. John 's wort rifampin ( may drugdrug interaction sorafenib . Patients know brain metastasis meningeal carcinomatosis exclude . Patients neurological symptom must undergo CT scan/MRI brain exclude brain metastasis . Pregnant woman exclude sorafenib potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Female patient must either childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ≤ 7 day prior treatment . Female patient consider childbearing potential surgically sterile ( undergone hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Men must use effective birth control partner childbearing potential . No malignancy allow except adequately treat carcinoma insitu cervix , superficial transitional cell carcinoma bladder basal/squamous cell skin cancer . Other cancer permissible patient disease free ≥ 3 year . Pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event ≥ CTCAE Grade 2 within 4 week first dose study drug . Any hemorrhage/bleeding event ≥ CTCAE Grade 3 within 4 week first dose study drug . Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . Evidence history bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Major surgery , open biopsy significant traumatic injury within 4 week first study drug . Known suspected allergy sorafenib agent give course trial .</criteria>
