	<brief_summary>This project consist two part : Robotic Rehabilitation Trials , Study Outcome Predictors Clinimetric Attributes . In first part study , investigator aim ( 1 ) investigate treatment effect robot-assisted therapy ( RAT ) patient stroke various outcome , ( 2 ) test dose-response relation use two different intensity ( high versus lower intensity RAT ) , ( 3 ) investigate effect train intensity biomarker oxidative stress . Treatment outcomes encompass spectrum function include motor ability , motor control strategy , basic/extended daily function , mobility , community reintegration , quality life , biomarker ( 8-OHdG ) . In second part study , purpose define appropriate population RAT examine clinimetric property clinical measure relevant use robotic rehabilitation research . investigator identify clinical predictor potentially influence functional outcome intervention . Finally , investigator examine compare clinimetric property ( e.g. , validity responsiveness ) clinical measure rehabilitation outcome inform selection test instrument may detect clinically meaningful change rehabilitation therapy .</brief_summary>
