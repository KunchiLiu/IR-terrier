	<brief_title>Computerized Cognitive Skills Training Adolescents With Velocardiofacial Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Velocardiofacial syndrome ( VCFS ) genetic condition cause deletion segment 22nd chromosome location 22q11.2 . VCFS characterize combination medical problem relate palate ( velo ) heart ( cardio ) distinct facial appearance . Also common people VCFS , among problem , learn speech difficulty . These difficulty specifically categorize deficit attention , work memory , executive functioning . This study develop test computer-based intervention adolescent VCFS teach cognitive skill lessen deficit . This study three phase . In first phase , intervention pilot test in-person coach . In second phase , intervention pilot test remotely video-conferencing coach . In third phase , intervention deliver remotely , test expand include participant longer assessment period . Information participant drop-out level difficulty gather used refine treatment phase . Participation Phase 1 last 6 month . At study entry , participant complete baseline measure involve structure diagnostic interview assess behavioral emotional difficulty cognitive test ass intellectual functioning . Then meet study train coach three time week home . During session , participant complete exercise Challenging Minds program , computer-based system design improve learning . Exercises develop skill seven domain : attention , decision making , memory , understand relationship object , problem solving , communication , social perception . Participation Phase 2 last 6 9 month . Participants phase complete baseline measure occur study entry complete exercise Challenging Minds three time week . Instead train coach come home , participant Phase 2 work training coach via video-conferencing software . Participation Phase 3 last 2 year . Participants undergo assessment four point : baseline , 9 month , 18 month , 27 month . These assessment include baseline measure previous phase well virtual reality computer task . Between visit 9 18 month , participant work train coach via video conferencing three time week complete Challenging Minds exercise .</detailed_description>
