	<brief_summary>It previously report cerebral oxygen desaturation cardiac surgery associate increase incidence cognitive impairment . The aim study determine whether intraoperative monitoring predetermine intervention protocol improve cerebral oxygenation coronary artery bypass surgery provide benefit neurocognitive function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neurologic complication major cause morbidity follow coronary artery bypass graft surgery . The neurologic injury range severity subclinical cognitive change fatal brain injury death . These complication represent big impact overall morbidity , mortality association increase cost length hospital stay . The social impact also important consequence patient ' quality life . Several study report incidence cognitive decline cardiac surgery range 30 80 % . The common etiology embolization hypoperfusion brain . The In Vivo Optical Spectroscopy ( INVOS ) system use near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) provide noninvasive continuous information change regional oxygen saturation blood brain ( rSO2 ) . When rSO2 decline occur respond simple intervention prevent brain injury . These intervention include : reposition head perfusion cannulae , increase arterial carbon dioxide tension , increase oxygen inspiration concentration , increase arterial blood pressure , adjust pump flow rate , temperature decreasing , increase anesthetic depth blood transfusion . Recent study report intraoperative cerebral oxygen desaturation associate early postoperative neuropsychological dysfunction patient undergoing cardiac surgery . Neurocognitive function assess battery standardized neurocognitive test . Mini Mental State Examination , Color Trail Test , Grooved Pegboard Test easy perform bedside test test orientation , registration , attention , calculation , recall , language complex visual-motor coordination .</detailed_description>
