	<brief_title>The Effect Nasal Carbon Dioxide ( CO2 ) Used As-Needed Symptomatic Treatment Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-center , parallel group , pilot study evaluate efficacy safety as-needed nasal , non-inhaled administration CO2 ( nasal CO2 ) patient SAR . Approximately 50 patient meet eligibility criterion enrol study 4 site ensure approximately 30 patient complete study . Patients randomize one two treatment group provide either active placebo dispenser . All patient administer study drug 10 second nostril Day 0 clinic as-needed 6 time day wake hour ( dos must least 2 hour apart ) 14 day . Patients assess nasal non-nasal symptom patient diary . Each patient 's participation study may last 72 day . There total 5 schedule clinic visit : - Visit 1 Screening - Visit 2 Enrollment ( within 42 day Visit 1 ) - Visit 3 Randomization ( completion 3-7 day run-in period ) - Visit 4 Mid-Treatment ( Day 7 ± 1 day ) - Visit 5 End Treatment ( within 1-3 day last study drug administration ) Sites follow-up randomized patient via telephone 7 ± 1 day last study drug administration .</detailed_description>
