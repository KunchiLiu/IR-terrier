	<brief_summary>Metabolic syndrome define group associate risk factor cardio-vascular disease diabetes . It usually treat association restrictive diet , physical exercise drug . Nevertheless type exercise associate reduction cardio-vascular risk yet fully define . Long term effect hygienic-diet program great importance since well-known compliance treatment short duration , namely subject return routine life . Metabolic syndrome volunteer subject ( n=90 ) , age 50 70 yr randomly assign 3 group investigation.One group perform mostly resistance activity , second mainly endurance activity third one composed subject exercise lot . All subject restrictive diet ( 500-700 kcal/d ) After initial training ( 3 week ) , return home diet physical program advises ( personal compliance ) . They follow one year ( 3 , 6 12 month ) Such design may allow find type activity power best reduce metabolic syndrome parameter cardio-vascular risk factor . The primary outcome variable reduction abdominal circumference , main criterion MS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The protocol design determine type physical activity best reduce metabolic syndrome parameter especially abdominal circumference . 90 Metabolic syndrome ( MS ) Patients recruit advertising check MS criterion . They VO2max test order sure perform physical activity safely . After checked , patient eight day period think participation ask question sign consent . They feel 3 questionnaire , one regular physical activity , one food intake psychology one measure reluctance program . After write informed consent obtain , patient randomly assign one 3 group physical activity Group 1 perform mostly resistance activity , group 2 mostly endurance activity , group 3 perform activity low level , serve control group physical activity also determine importance food reduction food equilibrium treatment . All subject restrictive diet ( 500- 700 kcal/d ) . They follow one year ( 3 , 6 12 month ) , continue home program ( diet exercise training ) . 30 healthy subject recruit cross-sectional comparison ( They follow intervention , investigation , ) . Measured parameter Before 3-week program 3 , 6 12 month , follow measurement make Level physical activity quantify heart rate activity train 3 week estimate thereafter parameter . Physical capacity With 6 minute walk test , Food intake equilibrium measure full week record training , train monthly thereafter . They quantify trained dietician use reference French Cidal table . Metabolic syndrome factor Body composition include weight , height , abdominal circumference , total torcular lean total abdominal fat mass measure DXA Cardiac diastolic systolic function mean standard , Tissue Doppler image 2D-strain echocardiogram Vascular structure function conduit resistance artery microvascular reactivity Biological parameter glycemic control : insulinemia glaced haemoglobin Inflammatory syndrome relate cytokine : CRP , 1GPA , IL-6 , TNF- , Il-12 IL-10 blood protein : Albumine transthyretin Appetite hormone : Leptine , adiponectin , Gremlin CCK osteocalcin , BASP CTx Statical analysis Subject number calculate result pilot . A statistical significance ( p=0,05 ) may reach 22 subject group 1 2 difference 0,6 kg abdominal fat mass . For cross-sectional comparison , healthy MS subject compare unpaired Student test . The 3 group patient compare use repeated measure ANOVA . If positive , post-hoc test mean comparison perform . A correlation matrix analyse relationship study parameter . A principal component analysis allow determine reciprocal weight positive explicating factor . The study do apply French international regulation</detailed_description>
