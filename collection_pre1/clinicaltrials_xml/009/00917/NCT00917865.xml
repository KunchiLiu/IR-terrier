	<brief_summary>The purpose research project test compound ( chemical substance ) natural tendency go prostate cancer . This compound small amount radioactivity attach call radiotracer . The name radiotracer FACBC detect special imaging device call PET scanner ( positron emission tomography ) . The radiotracer treat body much like amino acid nutrient require normal functioning . Tumors also use nutrient . Earlier study show radiotracer may able detect prostate cancer . The investigator perform study 20 patient know prostate cancer biopsy schedule operation prostate remove nearby lymph node examine . This operation call prostatectomy . The investigator think radiotracer help u determine exactly prostate cancer present prostate spread . This information may useful future help non-surgical therapy radiation beam therapy . The investigator compare result FACBC PET scan result pathology analysis remove prostate . In way investigator determine good test FACBC PET find prostate cancer locate prostate nearby lymph node . The investigator also advance analysis biopsy sample see tell FACBC go prostate cancer cell . This radiotracer test 100 human subject without incident . It also choose National Institutes Health ( NIH ) promise radiotracer . The NIH funding study .</brief_summary>
