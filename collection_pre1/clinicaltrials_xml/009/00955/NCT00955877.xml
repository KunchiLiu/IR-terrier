	<brief_summary>The purpose proposal improve investigator ' current Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy ( SDR ) analgesia protocol eliminate minimize use fentanyl post-operative period . Children undergo SDR spastic cerebral palsy significant post-operative pain . The procedure require dissection lumbar back musculature removal L1 lamina ( bony posterior part vertebra ) . The majority operation intradural , water-tight dural closure termination operation critical order prevent leakage cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) wound . In fact , child must remain flat back 48 hour allow dural incision heal prior mobilization . Thus , adequate pain control essential patient comfort , also prevent agitation additional stress dural closure . Currently , investigator ' patient undergo SDR treat 48 hour schedule intravenous ( IV ) narcotic ( continuous fentanyl infusion 0.5-2.0 μg/kg/hour ) addition sedative/muscle relaxant Valium ( 0.2 mg/kg IV every 4 hour 24 hour , every 6 hour 24 hour ) . The IV fentanyl , less degree Valium , carry real risk hypotension respiratory depression require frequent dose adjustment achieve adequate analgesia . By improve current SDR analgesia protocol , investigator hope maximize patient safety comfort maintain effectiveness operation minimize risk CSF leak .</brief_summary>
