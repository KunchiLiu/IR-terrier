PURPOSE : This clinical trial study blood urine sample patient newly diagnose localized prostate cancer treat hormone therapy radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Blood Urine Samples Patients With Newly Diagnosed Localized Prostate Cancer Treated With Hormone Therapy Radiation Therapy . ICORG 06-15</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Detect change serum urine proteomic profile predict outcome patient newly diagnose localized prostate cancer treat hormonal therapy radiotherapy . - Identify prognostic biochemical marker early disease progression patient treat regimen . - Identify unique protein expression temporal alteration , profile , facilitate understanding factor predict relapse toxicity . - Identify molecular signature allow identification target therapeutic intervention . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive induction hormones* ( bicalutimide releasing-hormone agonist ) approximately 4 month prior start radiotherapy . Patients receive radiotherapy consist 74 Gy maximum 81 Gy prostate gland per standard treatment.NOTE : * Patients receive short-term hormonal treatment 4-8 month eligible participate trial . Blood urine sample collect baseline , periodically induction therapy proteomic analysis . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
