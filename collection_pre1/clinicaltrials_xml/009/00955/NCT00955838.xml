	<brief_title>Brain Computer Interface ( BCI ) Based Robotic Rehabilitation Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose rehabilitation device first neuro-rehabilitation system combine non-invasive BCI robotic rehabilitation paralyse stroke upper extremity within 6 month stroke.Spontaneous recovery stroke take place first 6-12 month stroke . The first 3-6 month crucial period period maximal neurological recovery neuroplasticity . Differential rate recovery occur various type impairment post-stroke . In general , motor function ( mobility , walking , upper limb function , activity daily live ( ADL ) ) recover faster cognitive language impairment may recover 12 month . A number approach stroke injury rehabilitation introduce facilitate intrinsic recovery aid adaptive compensation stroke-related impairment . Generally rehabilitative training effective , must commence early possible stroke . Current research prove rehabilitation use traditional neuro-facilitation approach effective improve neurological functional recovery superior treatment nursing care alone . Rehabilitated patient shorter total hospitalization stay , low complication rate , early high rate discharge home patient receive rehabilitation . In addition , rehabilitation involve multidisciplinary team approach lead rehabilitation physician specialist result well functional outcome compare acute general ward-based therapy . In order rehabilitation effective modify cortical neuroplasticity , must target specific stroke impairment , task specific , exercise must repetitive intensive , goal direct command attention stroke patient . Some component rehabilitation include physical therapy , gait balance training , aerobic conditioning , functional Activities Daily Living ( ADL ) training , physical modality treat pain , Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) Neuro-Muscular Electrical Stimulation ( NMES ) . Other method include specific treatment address complication rehabilitation spasticity , ataxia , contractures bladder bowel incontinence . Often , one-to-one highly labour-intensive expensive therapy close hand-over-hand treatment require . Limitations current physiotherapy occupational therapy technique include follow : ( 1 ) Difficulties rehabilitation severely paralysed arm hand often treat passive modality NMES , passive ROMs modality . ( 2 ) Difficulties achieve intensive rehabilitation high repetition moderate severe upper extremity paralysis either due non participation pain commoner severe paralysis . ( 3 ) Problems motivate sustain patient interest repetitive exercise . ( 4 ) Therapy often perceive boring due lack immediate biofeedback . ( I ) Robot Aided Rehabilitation : MIT ( USA ) develop robot , name MIT-MANUS , aid therapy stroke victim . Small clinical trial report robot significantly improve patient ' recovery arm motor movement function sustain gain several month cessation treatment . This system clinically use rehabilitation train tool 20 centre world-wide . Advantages robot aid rehabilitation include ability document store motion force parameter , ability achieve thousand repetition per treatment session ( 100 time conventional treatment FES ) without cause tissue injury pain , high intensity low friction , attention training increase biofeedback incorporation interactive video game , simulate trajectory , maze , ADL task prepare meal spatial task simulation go shopping . In addition , initial training period , supervision patient therapist reduce due sustainability participation patient robot BCI base Robotic Rehabilitation . Hence , productivity human therapist increase robot . The robot thus act high technology aid clinician therapist . The system also portable , give rise possibility tele-rehabilitation option performance progress patient monitor institution remotely . ( II ) BCI-based BCI base Robotic Rehabilitation : This non invasive device aim use novel approach robotic training , employ therapeutic realm before.In MIT-MANUS relate commercially available system , direct communication patient 's mind thinking process motor volitional thinking robotic system . Although sensor use detect patient 's weak movement , never know patient want move . The robot arm patient tether constrained plan trajectory movement patient reduces active role patient recovers voluntary motion . In time , patient passively follow predefined program , may fully explore patient 's motor initiatives potential attention process .</detailed_description>
