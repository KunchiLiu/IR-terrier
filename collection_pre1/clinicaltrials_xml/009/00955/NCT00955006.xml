	<brief_title>Immune Response HIV DNA Plasmid Vaccine Prime Followed Adenovirus Boost HIV-uninfected Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic may control development safe effective vaccine prevent HIV infection . DNA vaccine inexpensive construct , readily produce large quantity , stable long periods time . This study evaluate safety immunogenicity experimental multiclade HIV vaccine , VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP , follow similarly structure adenovirus-vectored vaccine boost , VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP , HIV uninfected adult . The DNA plasmid vaccine code protein HIV subtypes A , B , C , together represent 90 % new HIV infection world . The study 's primary objective investigate ability 6-plasmid DNA prime follow rAd5 boost elicit HIV-specific cellular immune response mucosal surface . This study last 12 month participant visit clinic 15 time . Participants receive three injection VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP vaccine Months 0 , 1 , 2 follow injection VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP Month 6 . All injection give upper arm . At study visit participant physical , medical history take , blood collection , risk reduction counseling . At visit , rectal biopsy ( via anoscopy , optionally , flexible sigmoidoscopy ) , saliva , semen , cervical and/or vaginal fluid sample also collect . Pregnancy test woman do prior vaccination study procedure . Participants contact study staff year 5 year initial study visit follow-up health safety monitoring .</detailed_description>
