	<brief_summary>Background : - The uterine cervix compose muscle collagen , change woman age hormonal influence like puberty , pregnancy , menopause . Yet even though knowledge structure cervix ( especially collagen network ) important detect problem may affect pregnancy woman health issue , noninvasive technique available evaluate change . - A specially design polarize camera attach conventional colposcope use take cervical image . Analyzing image may enable researcher well visualize collagen network cervix . Objectives : - To explore gain experience use polarize image system study cervical structure . - To evaluate usefulness polarize imaging system study cervical structure healthy nonpregnant woman . Eligibility : - Adult female ( least 18 year age ) regular menstrual cycle hormonal medication . Design : - Images take cervix two different phase menstruation cycle time , one follicular phase ( ovulation ) another one luteal phase ( ovulation ) . - The image cervix take vaginal speculum place camera attach colposcope . The colposcope illuminate cervix use polarized light . Three random cervical location photograph</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The uterine cervix compose muscle collagen change woman age hormonal influence like puberty , pregnancy , menopause . It determine pregnancy , prior cervical ripening , cross link collagen fibril organize tight bundle provide tensile strength , rigidity stiffness . As cervix ripen preparation labor , cervical collagen concentration decrease solubility increase . However , noninvasive technique available evaluate structural change especially collagen cervix . Developing non-invasive way evaluate characteristic cervical structure collagen may aid identify woman risk early cervical dilation . A specially design polarize camera attach conventional colposcope use take cervical image . Analyzing image may enable u visualize collagen network cervix . The purpose study explore usefulness polarize camera image evaluate cervical structure healthy woman different age . After evaluate validate approach healthy , nonpregnant woman , plan assess cervical structure pregnant woman , may risk early cervical dilation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age female 18 year great include IUI patient . Healthy woman without significant medical problem uterine cervix . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Those symptom sign infection currently menstruate . Any medical condition , opinion Principal Investigator , would preclude inclusion patient onto research study . Unable unwilling give inform consent .</criteria>
