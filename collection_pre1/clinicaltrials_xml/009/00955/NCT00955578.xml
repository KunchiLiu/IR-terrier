	<brief_summary>The investigator ' goal identify mutation gene responsible development segmental dysplastic nevus . To identify gene investigator may use candidate gene approach ( i.e . sequence specific gene think involve : NRAS , BRAF , etc ) genome-wide approach try implicate region genome ( Loss-of-heterozygosity copy number change comparative genomic hybridization ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Identification ( ID ) Segmental Dysplastic Nevi</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dysplastic ( atypical ) melanocytic ( DMN ) nevi identify potential precursor melanoma marker patient risk develop primary melanoma1 . In addition , increase number nevi associate increased risk1 . DMN present 2-5 % white adult U.S. population international study document 18 % prevalence2 . These lesion may present least 17 % white adult melanoma 20-50 % melanoma may arise nevi atypical nevi2 . The exact gene ( ) involve development nevus yet elucidate . Segmental dysplastic nevus nevi restrict one area body3 . This condition much rarer occurrence dysplastic nevus , nonetheless , may involve genetic mutation . The pattern distribution SDN think result mosaicism , i.e . part body express dysplastic nevi mutation gene , however , rest body contain mutation . Other mosaic disorder study great detail SDN show cause single gene mutation4 . It appear SDN different cause mutation single gene , however , gene yet know . In study perform genetic analysis tissue patient know SDN . With information gather analysis , may able find gene responsible development dysplastic nevus . Primary Research Objective : To investigate genetic mutation involve development dysplastic nevus examine patient SDN .</detailed_description>
