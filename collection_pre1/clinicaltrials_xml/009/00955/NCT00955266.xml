	<brief_summary>Successful heart surgery require resumption strong beating heart prior separation heart lung machine . There different way . At hospital , surgical team usually give calcium people come heart lung machine doctor believe calcium `` jump start '' heart . Not every hospital . Some people think calcium may side effect make heart stiff . Stiff heart beat well receive much blood tissue non-stiff heart . If calcium make heart stiff , doctor may use medicine support heart operate room intensive care unit . This may ultimately lead poor outcome include long stay intensive care unit hospital . This study perform find calcium side effect make heart stiff . This study compare calcium placebo . The placebo look exactly like calcium , contain calcium . During study patient may receive placebo instead calcium . Neither doctor study team know drug subject receive .</brief_summary>
