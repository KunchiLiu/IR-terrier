	<detailed_description>Purpose : A single-site , randomize , blind , prospective clinical trial propose determine significance combine isokinetic strength aerobic exercise training program rehabilitation peripheral nerve function Type 2 diabetic veteran non-veterans neuropathy . Background Significance : Obesity major factor increase rate diabetes related complication . Diabetes affect great 7 % population . Veterans even great risk , approximately 16 % currently receive treatment Department Veterans Affairs Medical Centers diabetes . More half affected veteran experience debilitate complication diabetes , include peripheral neuropathy ( PN ) . Exercise training , combination pharmacologic intervention , recognize cornerstone management diabetes . Therapeutic intervention currently available treatment PN diabetic patient limit , however , pain management stringent glycemic control . Exercise report significantly decrease peripheral nerve microvascular complication common among chronic diabetic . Our preliminary finding demonstrate exercise intervention improve peripheral nerve function diabetic veteran PN . Intervention strategy , propose application , offer unique novel therapeutic option rehabilitation neuro-compromised Type 2 diabetic veteran non-veterans . Methods &amp; Research Plan : One-hundred subject recruit 24-week study . Subjects randomly assign aerobic , isokinetic strength training , combine aerobic strength training , non-exercise ( control ) intervention group . Isokinetic strength training ( Biodex System 3 ) , aerobic exercise training ( treadmill ) , combination strength aerobic training administer 3x per week initial 12 week . Control subject receive 12 clinical visit course initial 12 week . The effect exercise train type , compare control subject , recovery peripheral nerve function rigorously determine baseline , 12- 24-week test use electrodiagnostic primary outcome measure , Quantitative Sensory Testing , battery validate qualitative quantitative secondary outcome measure include incremental symptom-limited treadmill test , peak torque , Total Neuropathy Score , visual analogue pain scale , quality life SF-36V Health Survey . Sustainability effect determine 24-weeks.The individual effect exercise train type , compare control subject , tissue oxygenation determine baseline , 12- 24-week test non-invasive quantitated infrared spectroscopy use InSpectraTM Tissue Spectrometer . Expected Outcomes : This study objectively critically determine type combination exercise need rehabilitate neuro-compromised diabetic Veteran . Guided exercise protocol may prove practical therapeutic option prophylactic management diabetic subject neuropathy .</detailed_description>
