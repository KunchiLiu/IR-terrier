	<detailed_description>Many surgeon pursue volar plating distal radius allow early post-operative wrist motion . Early motion generally prescribe belief result great final motion without compromise fixation . However , study fail demonstrate clinically significant improvement final wrist motion ( &gt; 1 year follow ) compare treatment require long immobilization external fixation bridge plating ( McQueen 1996 , Handoll 2003 , Atroshi 2006 , Krishnan 2003 , Sommerkamp 1994 , Grewal 2005 ) . Only one study date attempt define early effect wrist mobilization follow volar plate fixation distal radius ( Lozano-Calderon 2008 ) . That study prospectively enrol 60 patient randomized begin wrist motion 2 week ( range 7 day - 13 day ) 6 week ( range 42 49 day ) postoperatively . This study find significant difference subjective objective outcome measure 3 6 month follow . However , investigation several weakness . First , attempt confirm adherence immobilization protocol . Those late motion group cast remain orthoplast splint could easily remove . Secondly , investigation collect data 3 6 month prohibit comment rate improvement early week mobilization . The author acknowledge limitation noted evaluation patient cost perform . Finally , radiographic evaluation study include analysis change alignment immediate postoperative film . Thus , literature date suggest early mobilization volarly plat distal radius safe improve final wrist motion . The benefit mobilization early postoperative period though clearly define . This project propose fill void literature determine early mobilization effective measure hasten recovery motion function .</detailed_description>
