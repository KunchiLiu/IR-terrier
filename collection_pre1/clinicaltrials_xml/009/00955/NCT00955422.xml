	<brief_summary>Background : - Individuals demonstrate symptom Alzheimer disease , progressive memory loss , may eligible participate National Institutes Health research study . However , physical psychological condition may produce symptom similar Alzheimer disease . To determine whether patient meet eligibility criterion participate research protocol , researcher must perform series diagnostic test procedure . - These evaluation design evaluate participant general medical condition ( example , blood test neurological exam ) confirm diagnosis rule individual consideration . They maximize safety participant study conduct National Institutes Mental Health . Objective : - To determine eligibility individual active Alzheimer disease protocol . Eligibility : - Individuals 45 year age old memory problem get bad time interfere everyday life .

	<detailed_description>Objective : To provide mechanism recruitment screen AD patient inclusion study conduct National Institutes Health . To provide data MRI [ 18F ] FDG PIB PET image healthy volunteer compare AD patient . To provide longitudinal data MRI [ 18F ] FDG PIB PET image AD patient healthy volunteer . Study population : Patients sign symptom Alzheimer disease . Healthy age-matched volunteer . Design : Patients sign symptom Alzheimer disease recruit community use advertisement communication neurologist , psychiatrist , general practitioner community . Patients come NIH evaluation may include medical neurological evaluation , laboratory testing , brain MRI , neuropsychological evaluation , brain imaging [ 18F ] fluorodeoxyglucose ( [ 18F ] FDG ) carbon-11 label Pittsburgh Compound B ( PIB ) PET . The focus protocol assist diagnosis AD vs. another cause memory impairment . Eligible patient offer participation protocol Molecular Imaging Branch . Eligible patient may also refer study NIH . Patients offer treatment long-term follow-up protocol . Age match healthy volunteer undergo brain imaging MRI [ 18F ] FDG PIB PET . Healthy volunteer patient meet diagnostic criterion AD ask repeat study procedure interval least one year 5 year . Outcome measure : Results medical neurological evaluation , neuropsychological testing , laboratory test , brain MRI use determine patient meet NINDS criterion probable Alzheimer disease . In patient undergo brain image [ 18F ] FDG PIB PET , PET data use investigational purpose subject participate protocol Molecular Imaging Branch . Results brain image healthy volunteer use compare AD patient . [ 18F ] FDG PIB PET may also useful determine patient meet criterion probable Alzheimer disease .</detailed_description>
