	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness ustekinumab golimumab compare placebo ( placebo look like drug study , active ingredient ) . The purpose research study determine ustekinumab golimumab safe determine effect ( good bad ) patient chronic sarcoidosis pulmonary and/or skin involvement . Patients pulmonary involvement constitute primary population analysis , patient skin involvement constitute secondary population ; patient may populations . The study conduct approximately 40 site globally .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Effectiveness Ustekinumab Golimumab Administered Subcutaneously ( SC ) Patients With Sarcoidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ustekinumab approve dose patient psoriasis golimumab approve dose patient rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis ankylose spondylitis . This study use either drug patient chronic sarcoidosis . Ustekinumab golimumab test see may useful treat chronic sarcoidosis . This study compare effect ( good bad ) ustekinumab golimumab placebo . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness ustekinumab golimumab ( administer individual treatment ) patient chronic sarcoidosis lung and/or skin involvement still symptoms even though receive current therapy . About 180 patient take part study . While study , patient may take part medical research study . Ustekinumab golimumab approve national health authority treatment chronic sarcoidosis ; therefore , use research set treat condition . The screen phase study , doctor determine patient eligible study , last 1 4 week . Patients put 1 3 group group get different treatment . The result golimumab group ustekinumab group compare placebo . Patients either receive ustekinumab , golimumab placebo . Placebo look like ustekinumab golimumab give way , injection , contain active drug . Patients receive study agent Week 24 continue follow Week 44 assessment safety effect discontinuation therapy . The patient continue take sarcoidosis medication ( ) current , stable dose first part study . If patient remain stable steroid dose Week 0 Week 16 study , study doctor begin taper ( low ) steroid dose . The steroid taper continue end Week 28 visit . The patient continue take sarcoidosis medication ( ) dose rest study . An independent Data Monitoring Committee responsible review safety data study . Patients study 48 week . The end study define last visit last patient . A site-specific substudy implement collect serum lung sample patient currently enrol study . A separate protocol implement collect lung fluid serum sample normal , healthy subject use comparators similar sample obtain 1275148SCD2001 substudy . Patients randomly assign 1 3 treatment group : ustekinumab ( 180 mg Week 0 , follow 90 mg Weeks 8 , 16 , 24 placebo Weeks 4 , 12 , 20 ) , golimumab ( 200 mg Week 0 , follow 100 mg Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 ) placebo ( Weeks 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 ) administer SC injection .</detailed_description>
