	<brief_summary>The purpose study build efficacy GEMOX regimen add Sorafenib treatment Biliary Tract Cancer . Since data combination three agent , investigator plan evaluate safety run-in phase I portion order define recommend phase II dose ( RPTD ) . The phase II trial enroll 40 patient RPTD level within 2 year order provide preliminary estimate progression-free survival ( primary endpoint trial ) target population .</brief_summary>
