	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well carboplatin , paclitaxel , bevacizumab ( CPB ) work give without cixutumumab treat patient non-small cell lung cancer stage IV come back ( recurrent ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Other type monoclonal antibody , cixutumumab , may find tumor cell help kill . It yet know whether give one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) together bevacizumab effective give without cixutumumab treat patient non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel , Carboplatin , Bevacizumab With Without Cixutumumab Treating Patients With Stage IV Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival combination carboplatin , paclitaxel , bevacizumab , +/- IMC-A12 ( cixutumumab ) patient advance , non-squamous , non-small cell lung cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival response rate combination patient non-squamous , advanced non-small cell lung cancer . II . To evaluate toxicity combination patient non-squamous advanced non-small cell lung cancer . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A ( CPB ) : Patients receive carboplatin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute , paclitaxel IV 3 hour , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . ARM B ( CPB+cixutumumab ) : Patients receive carboplatin , paclitaxel , bevacizumab Arm A . Patients also receive cixutumumab ( IMC-A12 ) IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Treatment bevacizumab cixutumumab may continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
