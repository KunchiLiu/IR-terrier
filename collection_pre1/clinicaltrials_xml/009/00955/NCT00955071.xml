	<brief_summary>The investigator randomize abdominally obese men woman increase health risk one follow 4 condition : 1 ) No-exercise , wait list control ( C ) , 2 ) Low volume , low intensity exercise ( LVLI ) , 3 ) High volume , low intensity exercise ( HVLI ) , 4 ) Low volume , high intensity exercise ( LVHI ) . The primary aim trial determine effect vary exercise dose ( energy expenditure , kcal ) intensity ( relative VO2max ( cardiorespiratory fitness ) ) waist circumference glucose tolerance . The investigator test follow hypothesis : 1 ) That reduction waist circumference improvement glucose tolerance response treatment great control . 2 ) That reduction waist circumference improvement glucose tolerance HVLI LVHI great LVLI . 3 ) That hypotheses 1 2 true independent gender .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men woman 40 60 year age . The low age range men woman select help ensure recruitment sample metabolic syndrome prevalence metabolic syndrome significantly relate age . The selection 60 year upper age range reflect concern randomize old adult high intensity exercise group wherein exercise 7580 % maximum may difficult achieve , likely associated increase orthopaedic injury thus , poor compliance . We also consider lower low age range 40 35 year , decide increase costeffectiveness recruitment ( e.g. , ensure high yield metabolic syndrome ) . Abdominally obese ( waist circumference great 88 102 cm woman men respectively ) NCEPATPIII define Metabolic Syndrome . Abdominal obesity nonCaucasians determine use value suggest International Diabetes Federation . Sedentary lifestyle ( planned physical activity purpose health one day per week le ) . Weight stable ( Â± 2 kg ) 6 month prior begin study . BMI le 40 kg/m2 ( Because lifestylebased intervention alone obesity reduction ideal person BMI le 40 kg/m2 ) . Physical impairment would make intervention difficult , unsafe accord patient 's physician include history myocardial infarction , stroke , coronary bypass surgery angioplasty last 6 month ; peripheral artery disease , unstable angina ischemia . Diabetes . Current smoker . Alcohol consumption &gt; 21 drink per week . Plans move area . Participating another research study . Clinically judge unsuitable participation adherence determine participant physician . Inability unwillingness provide inform consent . For woman , plan pregnancy next year .</criteria>
