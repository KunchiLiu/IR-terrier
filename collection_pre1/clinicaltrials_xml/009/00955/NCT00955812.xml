	<brief_title>STAT3 Inhibitor Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : OPB-31121 design block certain protein cancer cell cause cancer cell reproduce form cancer cell . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level OPB-31121 base join study . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose OPB-31121 found . Study Drug Administration : On Days 1-21 28-day cycle , take study drug mouth 2 time day . You take study drug least 1 full glass room temperature , still ( non-carbonated ) water , within 30 minute eat snack meal . You either remain sitting upright stand least 30 minute take study drug . You give direction study doctor , study nurse , and/or study pharmacist take study drug home . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You 5 ECGs : 1 morning dose study drug 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 hour morning dose . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take experienced side effect . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn morning dose 6 time next 12 hour dose pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) test draw morning dose . PD test use look level study drug body may affect disease . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn pharmacogenomic ( PGx ) test . PGx test look difference people 's gene may affect well study drug may affect disease . - Women able become pregnant urine pregnancy test . On Day 2 Cycle 1 , morning dose study drug , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn troponin test . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw PK PD test . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take experienced side effect . On Days 8 , 15 , 21 , 28 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ECG . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon Days 8 15 ; 1 tablespoon Days 21 28 ) urine collect routine test . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take experienced side effect . On Day 21 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn PK test morning dose 6 time next 12 hour dose . Blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) also draw PD test . On Day 22 Cycle 1 , morning dose study drug , follow test procedure perform : - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PK test morning dose study drug . On Days 1 , 15 , 28 Cycles 2 beyond , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect . - You ECG . - You echocardiogram MUGA scan . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You ask drug may take experienced side effect . - Women able become pregnant urine pregnancy test . About every 8 week , x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan check status disease . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long benefitting . You take study disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , doctor think longer best interest receive study drug . You may choose stop take study drug time . You tell study doctor right away think stop participation study . The study doctor talk safely stop take study drug . End-of-Study Visi : Within 14 day last dose study drug , return final visit . The following test procedure perform final visit : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ECG . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - You either ECHO MUGA scan . - You x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan check status disease . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take experienced side effect . Follow-Up : You call 30 day last dose OPB-31121 ask experienced new ongoing side effect . This investigational study . OPB-31121 FDA approve commercially available . At time , OPB-31121 use research . Up 36 patient take part multicenter study . Up 18 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
