	<brief_title>Naturlose ( D-Tagatose ) Efficacy Evaluation Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter clinical trial evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability D-tagatose ( compare placebo ) . Prior start treatment , subject participate 8-week run-in period diabetes education provide diet exercise treatment stabilize . Efficacy analysis conduct data 4 6 month . Screening Visit Based inclusion exclusion criterion , eligible subject underwent basic physical examination , pregnancy test female , hematology , clinical chemistry , urinalysis test . Basic physical examination include physical measurement , general examination observation , palpation , percussion , auscultation , blood pressure measure , heart rate check . The clinical laboratory test include : 1 ) hematology ( hematocrit , hemoglobin , MCH , MCHC , MCV , total white blood cell , platelet , differential ) ; 2 ) clinical chemistry ( sodium , chloride , potassium , CO2 , BUN , uric acid , albumin , creatinine clearance , SGOT , SGPT , bilirubin ( total direct ) , phosphorus , calcium , alkaline phosphatase , total protein , glucose ( fast ) ; 3 ) HbA1c ; 4 ) serum lipid profile include total cholesterol , HDL , LDL , triglycerides ; 5 ) urinalysis ( appearance , volume , specific gravity , pH , glucose , protein , microscopic evaluation urinary sediment ) . Run-in Period Subjects deem potentially eligible basis medical record continue previously establish diet exercise treatment program physician 's recommendation 8 week . Patients record food intake exercise nutrition diary . Treatment Period The treatment period consist 12 monthly visit , first use gather baseline data efficacy safety parameter also include first distribution test placebo treatment . Subjects receive study drug 6 month evaluate safety efficacy first 6 month safety thereafter . Baseline Distribution Test Placebo Treatments Approximately 550 enrolled subject randomize study . Subjects randomize one two treatment 1:1 ratio . Each eligible subject randomize group assignment basis randomly generate number . Randomization stratify screen HbA1c value ( &lt; 7.5 % ≥7.5 % ) ensure even distribution subject two treatment . Randomization take place Integrated Web-based Randomization System ( IWRS ) sit accessed order make randomize treatment assignment . After 8 week run-in period , subject return ( Visit 2 ) study sit underwent medical history review , examination clinical laboratory test perform screen visit . In addition , subject receive randomized study treatment detailed instruction use . There two treatment group trial : 1 . Drug ( D-tagatose ) , 2 . Placebo ( Splenda ) . The dose tagatose 15 g solution final volume approximately 4 ounce water ( ~250 mL ) take 3 time daily ( tid ) ; dose placebo ( Splenda ) 1.5 g. Treatments dispense unblinded staff member role trial ; clinical center staff blind treatment . If patient outside +/- 7 day window , investigator/site staff would document information subject chart provide Sponsor note file . Procedures Visits Every month Visit 2 subject return study site underwent comprehensive test underwent Visit 2 . Drug dietary compliance verify sachet count visit nutritional diary . DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE A study initiation meeting hold investigative site enrollment first subject review study design , study procedure , data collection , investigator responsibility . During interim field monitor visit , monitor verify CRF entry available source document ensure appropriate data collect documented . Independent GCP audit select study site perform . Prior data entry , CRFs check completeness consistency monitor verify source documentation maintain study site . Data CRF review query study site generate clinical data management staff CRO . Discrepancies reconcile study site respective laboratory . Prior data lock final audit report memo generate summarize audit finding give Data Manager Data analysis perform primarily Statistical Analysis System ( SAS® ) software , version 9.2 . SAS analysis datasets crosschecked locked database and/or CRF . Data summary table crosschecked SAS analysis datasets . All identified inconsistency report lead statistician resolve prior production report . This clinical study report check accuracy consistency sign-off . Statistical Analytical Plans Amarex LLC , Germantown , MD prepare statistical analysis plan ( SAP ) efficacy safety data database lock . Analysis Populations Intent-to-Treat Population The intent-to-treat ( ITT ) population define randomized subject receive least one dose double-blind study medication least one post-treatment visit evaluate efficacy . The ITT population use main efficacy evaluation . Per Protocol Population The per protocol ( PP ) population define subject ITT population 80 % compliance medication 75 % dosing time point major protocol violation eligibility violation . Safety Population The safety population consist randomized subject receive least one dose double-blind study medication least one post treatment visit evaluate safety . This population use safety analysis . Handling Duplicate , Missing Outlier Data For data identify Sponsor 's Medical Monitor clinical outlier , two separate analysis conduct , one include outlier one outlier exclude . The impact possible combination outlier treat context parameter . For ITT population , miss data ( include miss value intermediate visit ) impute schedule visit use last-observation-carried-forward ( LOCF ) method . A blind review data conduct prior statistical analysis determine data accuracy . Safety data compile subject without exclusion , case AEs , relationship study product make . The determination subject exclude analysis population jointly make sponsor investigator blind review meeting . Covariates , Stratification Factors , Subgroups To improve precision analysis , covariate analysis conduct . The respective baseline value use covariates analysis model continuous variable ; along pre-specified stratification factor , screen HbA1c value ( &lt; 7.5 % ≥7.5 % ) . The adjust least square ( LS ) mean time point report . Other clinically meaningful baseline covariates stratification factor examine ; statistically significant , factor include analysis model . Interim Analyses Two blind interim analysis ( IAs ) plan , one approximately 40 % subject randomize complete month 6 , 60 % subject randomize complete month 6 . The ITT population use analysis conduct IA . The IA direct conducted independent statistician , involve trial conduct IA . The main purpose IAs ass assumption make concern standard deviation sample size calculation primary end-point ( mean change HbA1c ) . Two IAs plan trial start earlier USA India , first IA likely reflect result USA population , second IA likely reflect result India population . For IA , independent statistician use blind data , observe pooled standard deviation , original assumption note sample size determination ( e.g . Power , Type I error rate ) recalculate sample size . Based documented sample size re-calculation observe dropout rate , intent independent statistician could recommend new , large sample size sponsor ; however , neither IA necessary . Statistical Methods Subject Characteristics The subject population enrol trial characterize accord - disposition subject within trial ; - demographic , baseline clinical laboratory assessment , previous concomitant medical history ; - concomitant medication ; - treatment duration compliance characteristic . Demographic baseline characteristic summarize also provide data listing . Continuous data variable summarize accord number observation , mean , standard deviation , median , minimum maximum value , categorical data variable summarize accord frequency count percentage . Treatment duration compliance characteristic summarize treatment group analysis population duration dose ( day ) calculate date last dose minus date first dose plus 1 . Percent compliance calculate [ ( total unit drug return minus total unit drug dispense ) divide total dispensed ] time 100 % . Efficacy Analyses Statistical test efficacy analyse two-sided , p-value adjustment , focus response ITT population PP population use supportive analysis . To assess primary end-point change HbA1c level baseline , general linear model ( analysis covariance ) adjust baseline important stratification factor , e.g. , baseline HbA1c site , use . In analysis , order protect statistical degree freedom , site pool accord location factor . The closed test procedure use secondary end-points order protect Type I Error rate α = 0.05 . For procedure , secondary end-points analyze follow order : 1 . Body Mass Index 2 . Triglycerides 3 . LDL 4 . Total cholesterol 5 . Fasting blood glucose 6 . Proportion subject achieve HbA1c &lt; 7 % and/or ≤6.5 % 7 . Insulin 8 . HDL</detailed_description>
