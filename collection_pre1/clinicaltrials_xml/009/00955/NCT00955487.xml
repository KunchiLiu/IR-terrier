	<brief_summary>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) serious lung condition affect premature newborn . The condition involve abnormal development lung tissue characterize inflammation scar lung . Treatment inhale nitric oxide ( iNO ) may reduce incidence BPD another commonly associate condition call pulmonary hypertension , high blood pressure vessel carry blood lungs.. This study determine early treatment low-dose iNO reduces incidence BPD , pulmonary hypertension , death premature newborn .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BPD serious lung condition primarily affect premature newborn newborns low birth weight . iNO proven safe effective treatment pulmonary hypertension hypoxemic respiratory failure—both abnormal lung conditions—in full-term newborn . However , baby bear prematurely , effect iNO lung function well define . Also , previous study mainly examine whether iNO reduces incidence BPD newborns mechanical ventilation . However , intubation mechanical ventilation premature newborns increasingly avoid , non-invasive support , include use nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( NCPAP ) , use . Early treatment low-dose iNO may reduce incidence BPD premature newborn require mechanical ventilation intubation delivery . The purpose study determine low-dose , non-invasive iNO reduces risk BPD , pulmonary hypertension , death premature newborns require mechanical ventilation . This study enroll premature newborn require extra oxygen require intubation mechanical ventilation respiratory failure first 72 hour life . Participants randomly assign receive low-dose , non-invasive iNO nitrogen ( placebo ) hospital stay . While hospitalize , participant ' heart rate , blood oxygen level breathe rate , blood pressure , medication monitor , blood collection occur various time . Monitoring continue participant 30 week correct gestational age least 14 day participant bear 29 week . All participant undergo ultrasound head 7 day , 28 day , 36 week age . They undergo echocardiogram , ultrasound heart , 7 21 day age 4 week original expect due date . A chest x-ray perform hospital discharge , breathe status test perform either 4 week participant ' original expect due date hospital discharge . Follow-up study visit occur Years 1 2 , include physical examination developmental behavioral testing . Another echocardiogram also perform Year 1 visit .</detailed_description>
