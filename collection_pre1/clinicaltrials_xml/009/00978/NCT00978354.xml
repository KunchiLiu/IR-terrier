	<brief_summary>Acute renal failure , refer acute kidney injury , common intensive care unit patient , contributes high morbidity mortality , proven intervention benefit establish . In addition supportive care , patient frequently receive diuretic therapy , commonly furosemide . Prior trial show impact furosemide clinical outcome perhaps harm , however , trial suffer numerous limitation lack applicability modern intensive care unit patient . As result , appear disconnect clinical practice available evidence . Survey data support view clinical equipoise use furosemide intensive care unit patient early acute kidney injury . Moreover , data also confirm urgent need high quality definitive evidence randomize trial furosemide use early acute kidney injury . Accordingly , investigator propose conduct pilot phase II randomize , blind , placebo-controlled trial compare furosemide placebo ICU patient early acute kidney injury . The specific aim study : 1 . To compare efficacy safety continuous infusion furosemide versus placebo titrate physiology parameter urine output early acute kidney injury primary outcome progression severity kidney injury intensive care unit patient early AKI stratify presence sepsis . 2 . To evaluate select secondary endpoint impact furosemide versus placebo , specifically : fluid balance goal ; electrolyte acid-base balance ; need renal replacement therapy ( i.e . dialysis ) ; total duration acute kidney injury ; rate renal recovery ; mortality . 3 . To compare impact furosemide versus placebo trajectory serum urinary biomarkers ( neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [ NGAL ] , interleukin-18 [ IL-18 ] ) evaluate whether biomarkers perform superior conventional measure ( creatinine , urea ) monitoring progression kidney injury prediction outcome . This trial represent part large initiative aim towards expand understand treatment acute kidney injury intensive care unit patient evaluate intervention may potentially reduce kidney injury improve clinical outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design , Setting Patient Population This phase II multi-centre , randomize , blind , placebo-controlled trial ICU patient early AKI randomization stratify sepsis . All critically ill patient admit participate ICUs screen eligibility . Operational Definitions 1 . Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) - The operational definition early AKI define classified accord RIFLE criterion ( modify AKIN ) . The presence early AKI define RIFLE class - RISK : abrupt ( within 48hr ) reduction kidney function characterize relative increase serum creatinine &gt; 50 % ( 1.5 fold ) &gt; 26.5 mcmol/L baseline reduction urine output ≤0.5 mL/kg/hr &gt; 6 hour . Trial Protocol Description Study Flow Patients identify ICU daily surveillance admit patient PI and/or research coordinator identify treat ICU physician . Each patient 's eligibility verify use one-page checklist summarize inclusion exclusion criterion . This checklist include standardized case-report form ( CRF ) . Study Intervention Following obtainment consent , patient commence continuous infusion either intervention ( furosemide ) identical placebo ( 0.9 % NaCl ) . The study protocol administration furosemide continuous infusion adapt phase I study Ostermann et al . The study infusion bag contain 2000mg furosemide 500mL 0.9 % NaCl final concentration 4mg/mL . The continuous infusion titrate achieve target urine output range 1.0-2.0 mL/kg/hr . Each patient administer load dose 0.4 mg/kg separate infusion bag follow continuous infusion commence dose 0.0125 ml/kg/hr . The maximum infusion rate 0.125ml/kg/hr . The urine output assess hourly . If target urine output achieve , current infusion rate continue . If target urine output achieve , dose increase next infusion rate algorithm . If urine output brisk ( &gt; 2mL/kg/hr ) , dose maintain unless follow criterion fulfil : decrease mean arterial pressure &lt; 65 AND/OR addition increase vasoactive requirement ≥20 % achieve goal mean arterial pressure OR central venous pressure &lt; 8 cmH2O OR central venous oxygen saturation &lt; 60 % OR cardiac index &lt; 2.0L/min/1.73m2 ( measure ) . If criterion achieve , dose decrease next low infusion rate algorithm . If aforementioned criterion fulfil AND urine output remain &gt; 2mL/kg/hr 2 consecutive hour despite low infusion rate , treatment discontinue 1 hour resume low infusion rate . The fulfillment criterion bring attention consultant ICU physician review . At time trial , responsible ICU physician believe diuretic urgently indicate ( pulmonary edema ) , diuretic administer event document . All aspects patient management within parameter outline ( method fluid resuscitation , choice fluid , vasoactive therapy , choice vasoactive therapy , adjuvant therapy hrAPC , intensive insulin therapy , discretion consultant ICU physician . The study drug infusion continue one follow event occur : 1. patient initiate RRT ; 2. patient dy ; 3. patient discharge ICU ; 4. patient recovers kidney function ; 5. patient develops recognize adverse reaction potentially relate study infusion . Methods Randomization The randomization sequence create single central location University Alberta Hospital ( EPICORE Centre ) . The sequence stratify presence diagnosis sepsis . Data Collection Detailed clinical , physiologic , laboratory outcome data collect . Data collect day whether primary endpoint ( progression AKI ) occur , evidence secondary endpoint criteria trial discontinuation . Plasma urine collect biomarkers study . Any study protocol violation record . The adjudication protocol violation determine study investigator blind treatment allocation . Proposed Follow-up The investigator plan follow patient determine duration AKI , continue need RRT , renal recovery mortality death discharge hospital 30 , 60 90-days randomization .</detailed_description>
