	<brief_summary>Background : - Patellofemoral pain syndrome one common knee problem . It characterize pain front knee aggravate deep knee flexion , prolong sitting , repetitive movement . The widely accept theory regard source pain force imbalance around knee put extra stress area , lead pain . - Researchers interested learn muscle group around knee good understand cause knee pain . Objectives : - To obtain information muscle , tendon , bone work together cause motion knee , normal state immobilize certain muscle around knee . Eligibility : - Healthy individual age 18 55 , current chronic muscle , bone , joint problem implant problem would prevent receive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Design : - This protocol carry two visit , involve use standard MRI sequence look knee rest motion . - The first part examine knee natural state , standard MRI scan knee rest motion . - The second part involve temporarily reduce force produce capability one extensor muscle knee . To , study doctor inject lidocaine muscle , temporarily ( approximately 2 hour ) block force produce capacity muscle , perform MRI scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patellofemoral pain syndrome one common problem knee . It characterize anterior knee pain aggravate deep knee flexion , prolong sitting , repetitive flexion/extension . The widely accept theory regard source pain force imbalance around knee lead static patellofemoral malalignment dynamic patellofemoral maltracking . In turn , malalignment maltracking lead elevate joint contact stress , ultimately lead patellofemoral pain . Current understanding patellofemroal maltracking typically focus static 2D alignment ( lateral tilt displacement ) . Yet , patellofemoreal pain often exacerbated dynamic event patella complete six degree freedom movement . More recent study able quantify patellofemoral kinematics volitional dynamic task demonstrate maltracking problem complex originally postulate . Specifically , patient patellofemoral pain , alter kinematics limited excessive patellar lateral translation tilt , include excessive patellar superior translation along excessive flexion varus rotation . Although result useful demonstrate specific maltracking pattern could lead patellofemoral pain , present association potentially alter force balance around knee observe maltracking pattern . Therefore , overall goal work determine specific source maltracking pattern patellofemoral pain . As part overall goal , purpose study determine loss force vasti medialis muscle alters dynamic control patellar kinematics .</detailed_description>
