	<detailed_description>The objective double blind randomize control study compare efficacy esomeprazole famotidine control dyspepsia patient aspirin related nonulcer dyspepsia NUD . Method The study shall apply approval Ethic Committee Hong Kong West East Cluster shall register Clinical Trial Governance recruitment first patient . Measuring instrument &amp; Definitions Hong Kong Dyspepsia Index ( HKDI ) The presence absence dyspepsia measure validate Hong Kong index dyspepsia . This questionnaire could use epidemiological study assess frequency severity dyspepsia patient population also interventional study functional dyspepsia.This index consist 12 question severity gastrointestinal symptom , grade accord five-point Likert scale ( 1- 5 , asymptomatic severe symptom ) . A cut-off score equal great 16 determined discriminate control dyspeptic patient . Global Dyspepsia Score The global severity dyspepsia measure Global Dyspepsia Score , four-point scale score 0 indicate pain discomfort , score 1 mild pain discomfort , score 2 moderate ( annoy interfere daily routine ) pain discomfort , score 3 severe ( markedly interfere daily routine ) pain discomfort last 7 day . This scale reliable , valid , responsive provide global assessment symptom western population . Significant dyspepsia define Global Dyspepsia Score equal 2 moderate . Definition significant endoscopic find Significant finding define presence reflux esophagitis , Barrett 's esophagus , gastric duodenal ulceration , duodenal esophageal erosion , cancer five gastric erosion upper endoscopy .
