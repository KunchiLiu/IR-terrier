	<brief_summary>Long-term anticoagulation indicate patient prophylaxis and/or treatment thromboembolic complication associate atrial fibrillation and/or mechanical cardiac valve replacement , prevention treatment venous thromboembolism ( deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism ) , prevent thromboembolic event post-myocardial infarction , patient systemic embolic event . Currently approve oral medication anticoagulation warfarin ( Coumadin , Bristol-Myers Squibb generic warfarin . Dosage control periodic determination prothrombin time ( PT ) /International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) . Under treatment may lead venous arterial thrombotic event stroke , treatment may lead major bleed even death . Patients require frequent INR monitoring maintain therapeutic level anticoagulation . The therapeutic INR range varies clinical indication , commonly INR 2-3 goal , range 1.5-4.0 . Bleeding complication likely occur INR value 4.0 . The vMetrics - Anticoagulation Management System remote patient management solution Oral Anticoagulation Care patient . This system provide confirmation patient question testing protocol well virtual patient management care capability dosage patient scheduling . This trial provide end point ascertain efficiency standard care protocol confirm equivalent care standard .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Remote Home Prothrombin Time ( PT ) /International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Monitoring Patient Management System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The creation optimal device patient self-testing protocol anticoagulation management area active medical research . The current pilot study represent initial step development new customized device purpose , vMetrics - Anticoagulation Monitoring System . The v-Metrics Anticoagulation Monitoring System ( vMetrics AMS ) define : 1 . A PT/INR home monitoring unit interface FDA approve PT/INR home monitor Hemosense INRatio device , 2. anticoagulation clinic patient management application manage patient communication , database prior test result , test schedule , communication EMR . The INR home-monitoring system test study address several limitation currently available technology practice standard home INR self-testing . The propose project develop self-testing device maximizes safety efficiency patient health care provider . The monitoring device ( vMetrics ) allow wireless transmission INR result approve home INR measure monitoring device ( ex : HemoSense - INRatio ) secure database health care provider staff anticoagulation clinic . The device also collect yes/no response set standard question subject assure patient safety determine optimal Coumadin dosing . Upon receipt patient data , Coumadin provider review INR result response question use standard Coumadin dosing protocol clinical judgment transmit dose instruction back patient device . A calendar schedule dose next schedule INR check transmit patient . In certain instance ( i.e. , high INR &gt; 5 ) , device transmit instruction call Coumadin clinic . The subject confirm receipt Coumadin dose send him/her press button device ( transmits confirmation back database ) . This process may reduce inconvenience subject , INR value report directly device reduce possibility error , two-way communication wireless reduce need telephone contact , thus potentially save health care provider patient time . In addition , data encounter available form enter patient 's electronic medical record . The patient enter data device use 4-digit passcode allow security data . In addition coordinate INR transmission home INR device , customized database provide platform anticoagulation clinic patient management application ( Wireless Home Coumadin clinic ) . This platform organize workflow Coumadin provider easily determine patient due ( overdue ) monitoring , patient transmit INR value questionnaire await response .</detailed_description>
