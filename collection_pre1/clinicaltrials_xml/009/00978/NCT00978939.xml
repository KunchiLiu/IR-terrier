	<brief_summary>Purpose Objective : The purpose study determine rate spontaneous pleurodesis use Pleurx® catheter could increase simply increase frequency pleural drainage , , whether catheter-related complication minimize spare patient need long term management Pleurx® catheter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Aggressive Versus Standard Drainage Regimen Using Long Term Indwelling Pleural Catheter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Population : Patients great 18 year age malignant pleural effusion identify approached clinic Principle Co-Investigator . Informed consent obtain qualified interested patient . Study Activities : Patients randomized standard aggressive drainage group complete questionnaire regard health . Patients receive Pleurx® catheter standard treatment malignant pleural effusion , obtain chest-xray , receive educational instruction training catheter drainage tell whether drain everyday use 1-liter bottle every day use 600-cc bottle . Patients complete drainage diary everyday drain fluid provide information drainage volume , fluid color , pain , complication . At 2 week , 6 week , 12 week post catheter placement , patient return clinic follow-up time interval history physical chest xray complete questionnaire regard health satisfaction . Risks/Safety Issues : Risks associate drain catheter include : pneumothorax , re-expansion pulmonary edema , hypotension , circulatory collapse , infection . All serious adverse event report institutional review board : ) death - immediately ; b ) life-threatening within 7 calendar day ; c ) SAEs ( serious adverse event ) within 15 calendar day . Should serious adverse event occur increase risk participant , study stop , investigation conduct , finding report generate study resume . Data Analysis : The principal endpoint incidence successful pleurodesis utilize aggressive drainage protocol compare incidence successful pleurodesis use standard drainage protocol . An interim analysis perform 3 month .</detailed_description>
