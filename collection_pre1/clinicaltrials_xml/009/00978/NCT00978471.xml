	<detailed_description>Despite absence tumor registry , approximately 150 new case osteosarcoma report year France ( 100 case per year child 50 case adult ) , 15 20 % metastatic . The standardized impact rate world population estimate 3 per million inhabitant per year . Further initial standard care , 45 % patient relapse within median interval 20 month ( range 3 month - 10 year ) . Results OS94 study investigation perform within CRLCC indicate 25 30 patient ( child adult ) experience osteosarcoma relapse year FRANCE . Results five major publish series indicate 5-year overall survival rate patient first relapse 23 28 % , median post-relapse survival 10 17 month . Multiple relapse case also report COSS study , median time second relapse 0.8 year . At present , reference treatment standard care osteosarcoma relapse FRANCE . Some recommendation give OS94 protocol , generally follow implement heterogeneous manner . Thiotepa ( N N ' N '' triethylenethiophosphoramide ) , alkylating agent chemical family ethylene-imines , know antitumor effect number malignant tumor . Its efficacy osteosarcoma report literature . A retrospective study SFCE ( French Society Childhood Cancer , result yet publish ) 45 patient present refractory osteosarcoma relapse show radiological reaction rate 30 % . Moreover , preliminary investigation perform CLB 2007 within framework SFCE study explore relapse case diagnose begin 2004 end 2006 . Results show 35 % patient osteosarcoma relapse treat high-dose thiotepa efficacy tolerance therapeutic strategy never assess . Altogether , result lead SFCE osteosarcoma group propose evaluation efficacy tolerance high-dose thiotepa chemotherapy within clinical trial include drug standard care osteosarcoma relapse .</detailed_description>
