	<brief_summary>Background : - Two experimental drug , FdCyd ( also call 5-fluoro-2'-deoxcytidine ) , THU ( also call tetrahydrouridine ) , undergoing trial test effectiveness treat cancer respond standard therapy . FdCyd think work change gene work cancer cell . THU anticancer effect , help keep drug , FdCyd , break body . - These drug test several separate clinical trial . Objectives : - To determine FdCyd THU work together control tumor growth . - To evaluate safety tolerability FdCyd THU give together . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old advance non-small cell lung cancer , breast cancer , bladder cancer , head neck cancer progress receive standard treatment effective therapy exists . Design : - The drug give 28-day period call cycle . FdCyd THU give vein 3 hour day day 1 5 8 12 cycle . - Clinical Center visit : FdCyd THU give vein day day 1 5 8 12 cycle . During Clinical Center visit , researcher perform study test procedure see study drug affect body . - Patients undergo number test procedures treatment cycle , include physical examination , blood urine sample standard test , image study ( ultrasound , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan ) evaluate tumor growth , blood urine sample evaluate amount FdCyd THU body body 's response drug . - Patients may continue receive FdCyd THU cancer grow , many side effect , willing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multi-Histology Phase II Study 5-Fluoro-2-Deoxycytidine With Tetrahydrouridine ( FdCyd + THU )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : 5-Fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine ( FdCyd ) , fluoropyrimidine nucleoside analog , short ( 10-minute ) half-life rapidly degrade vivo cytidine deaminase . However , coadministration tetrahydrouridine ( THU ) , inhibitor cytidine/deoxycytidine deaminase , show increase AUC parent compound 4-fold . Increased FdCyd exposure allow take intracellularly converted triphosphate , incorporate DNA inhibit action enzyme DNA methyltransferase ( DNMT ) . Inhibition DNMT , turn DNA methylation , result re-expression tumor suppressor gene . Objectives : - Determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) and/or response rate ( CR + PR ) FdCyd administer 5 day per week 2 week , 28-day cycle , intravenous infusion 3 hour along THU patient breast cancer , head neck cancer , non-small cell lung cancer , urothelial transitional cell carcinoma . - Evaluate whether treatment FdCyd THU alters DNA methylation pattern tumor biopsy sample treatment LINE-1 analysis . - Evaluate safety tolerability FdCyd ( 100 mg/m ( 2 ) ) + THU ( 350 mg/m ( 2 ) ) administer 5 day per week 2 week , 28-day cycle , intravenous infusion 3 hour . - Measure change number CTCs follow treatment FdCyd plus THU . Eligibility : -Patients histologically document non-small cell lung cancer , head neck cancer , urothelial transitional cell carcinoma , breast carcinoma . Design : - This multicenter trial NCI coordinating center California Cancer Consortium UPMC participate site . - FdCyd administer IV infusion 3 hour 20 % daily dose THU administer IV push remain 80 % co-administered FdCyd 3-hour infusion daily 5 consecutive day treatment per week 2 consecutive week , follow 2 week treatment , 28-day cycle . - Blood optional tumor biopsy pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic study obtain . - The study accrue maximum 165 patient include center .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically document metastatic unresectable nonsmall cell lung cancer , head neck cancer , urothelial transitional cell carcinoma , breast cancer whose disease progress least one line standard therapy . Patients solid tumor ( nonsmall cell lung cancer , head neck cancer , urothelial transitional cell carcinoma , breast cancer ) must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) great equal 20 mm conventional technique great equal 10 mm spiral CT scan . Patients tumor type whose disease limit skin eligible discretion PI must physical exam documentation skin lesion ( ) color photography , include ruler estimate size lesion ( ) . Diagnosis malignancy must confirm department pathology institution patient enrol prior patient enrollment . Any prior therapy must complete great equal 4 week prior enrollment protocol participant must recover eligibility level prior toxicity . Patients least six week nitrosoureas mitomycin C. Prior radiation complete great equal 4 week prior study enrollment associate toxicity resolve eligibility level . Patients must great equal 2 week since investigational agent administer part Phase 0 study ( also refer `` early Phase I study '' `` prePhase I study '' subtherapeutic dose drug administer ) PI 's discretion , recover eligibility level toxicity . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use FdCyd THU patient less 18 year age , child exclude study , may eligible future pediatric Phase I combination trial . Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 % . Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin le 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal creatinine le 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min patient creatinine level 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal . Because FdCyd show teratogenic animal , pregnant woman exclude trial . Nursing woman also exclude , unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother FdCyd . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study participation , 3 month completion study . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , partner inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients receive investigational agent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients clinically significant illness would compromise participation study , include , limited : active uncontrolled infection , immune deficiency confirm diagnosis HIV infection , active infection Hepatitis B Hepatitis C , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within past 6 month , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia ; psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . History allergic reaction attribute fluoropyrimidines ( e.g. , capecitabine , fluorouracil , fluorodeoxyuridine ) tetrahydrouridine .</criteria>
