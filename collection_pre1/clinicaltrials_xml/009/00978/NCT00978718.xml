	<brief_title>Selenium Preventing Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine whether selenium ( Se ) supplementation decrease incidence prostate cancer . - To determine whether Se supplementation inhibits biochemical progression prostate cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral placebo daily . Treatment continue 57 month absence unacceptable toxicity diagnosis prostate cancer . - Arm II : Patients receive 200 μg oral selenium ( Se ) high-Se Baker 's yeast daily . Treatment continue 57 month absence unacceptable toxicity diagnosis prostate cancer . - Arm III : Patients receive 400 μg oral Se high-Se baker 's yeast daily . Treatment continue 57 month absence unacceptable toxicity diagnosis prostate cancer . Blood sample collect baseline , randomization , semi-annually laboratory test . Tissue sample may also collect biomarker analysis . Patients complete initial questionnaire urological-symptoms questionnaire baseline , follow-up questionnaire randomization ( capture new illness , medication , toxicity symptom 30-day run-in period ; urological-symptoms questionnaire ; food-frequency questionnaire ; mood questionnaire ) . Patients undergo questionnaire semi-annually , include vital status , tablet compliance , nutrition , mood , new illness medication , incidence cancer family history cancer ) .</detailed_description>
