	<brief_summary>The Shared Health CHRâ„¢ ( Clinical Health Record ) offer point-of-care clinical reporting decision support base primarily patient claim data aggregate across various health care setting , one example type health information data exchange effort implement across country . This study evaluate CHR use clinical financial impact well understand CHR 's value , identify opportunity enhance system support patient care practice efficiency . In addition , result study help inform national debate effectiveness type tool maximize patient quality care , patient safety , practice efficiency .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Missing information point care frustrate physician patient lead unnecessary test suboptimal even inappropriate potentially harmful treatment . In addition risk poorer quality care , fragmentation incomplete unavailable clinical data may result increased cost healthcare system . Patient health record , electronically share across spectrum patient care setting , offer possibility improve healthcare outcome , include patient safety quality care , increase efficiency , well cost-effectiveness . This overall study consist two analysis . First , conduct before-and-after , pre-post study . The clinical practice consent participate serve control baseline period . During baseline period data retrospectively capture , physician conduct `` business usual '' without use CHR . The intervention consist participant access CHR assist medical decision patient care . Secondly , conduct concurrent match cohort comparison patient within practice . We compare outcomes gap care patient whose care associate frequent CHR use less frequent CHR use match control patient whose care associate CHR use . Safety , quality , cost outcome compare use two described approach . First , compare outcome gap care intervention patient whose care involve active CHR use intervention period care patient receive baseline period ( pre/post analysis ) . Secondly , compare outcomes gap care intervention active patient , super-active less active , match control patient whose care study involve CHR use intervention period ( matched cohort analysis ) . In order study relationship CHR use clinical , financial , office efficiency outcome within study 's timeline , limit study pre-existing patient new patient least one encounter study period . Hospital admission data also analyze part cost outcome analysis . We plan study effect CHR several condition among AHRQ 's Ambulatory Care Sensitive ( ACS ) Conditions . We study condition common , high-risk , resource dependent clinical management may improve access CHR include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma , congestive heart failure , angina/coronary artery disease , diabetes mellitus . In addition , condition determine value evaluate impact CHR may add , may replace exist condition . These condition choose base early work study learn number eligible patient number clinical interaction . The new condition , yet determine , may also include non-chronic , acute , diagnosis .</detailed_description>
