	<brief_title>Acupressure Wristbands Standard Care Controlling Nausea Caused Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess clinical effectiveness self-acupressure use wristband addition standard care management chemotherapy-induced ( acute delay ) nausea compare patient receive standard care sham-acupressure wristband standard care alone . Secondary - To assess cost effectiveness extent use usual care patient use acupressure wristband addition standard care management chemotherapy-induced nausea compare patient receive standard care sham-acupressure wristband standard care alone . - To assess level quality life patient use acupressure standard care alone . - To assess clinical effectiveness self-acupressure use wristband addition standard care management chemotherapy-induced ( acute delay ) vomit compare patient receive standard care sham-acupressure wristband standard care alone . - To ascertain emetogenic level chemotherapy regimen ( i.e. , high , moderate , low emetogenic chemotherapy ) self-acupressure use wristband addition standard care less effective term nausea compare patient receive standard care sham-acupressure wristband standard care alone . - To ascertain whether improvement chemotherapy-induced nausea vomit use acupressure wristband different male female . - To ascertain whether age effect use acupressure wristbands relation chemotherapy-induced nausea vomit . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord gender , age year ( 16 24 v &gt; 24 50 v &gt; 50 ) , level emetogenic chemotherapy ( high v moderate v low ) . Patients randomize 1 3 intervention arm : - Arm I ( acupressure group ) : Patients receive standard antiemetic comprise oral 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ( i.e. , Zofran ) oral IV dexamethasone 3 day post-chemotherapy ( highly emetic chemotherapy ) ; oral 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ( i.e. , Zofran ) dexamethasone IV chemotherapy 5-HT3 receptor antagonist dexamethasone 2 day post-chemotherapy ( moderately emetogenic chemotherapy ) ; oral dexamethasone chemotherapy ( low-emetogenic chemotherapy ) . Beginning morning chemotherapy , patient wear pair SeaBand™ elastic wristband arm 7 day . Each wristband 1-cm protruding round plastic button ( stud ) press P6 acupoint , locate anterior surface forearm , approximately three-finger width crease wrist tendon Palmaris longus flexor carpus radialis . - Arm II ( sham acupressure group ) : Patients receive standard antiemetic arm I . Beginning morning chemotherapy , patient wear pair elastic wristband arm 7 day . Each wristband flat button press P6 acupoint , locate anterior surface forearm , approximately three-finger width crease wrist tendon Palmaris longus flexor carpus radialis . - Arm III ( control group ) : Patients receive standard antiemetic arm I . Patients assess periodically questionnaire .</detailed_description>
