	<brief_title>Large Diameter Advanta™ V12 Covered Stent Trial Coarctation Aorta</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The performance metric comparison base data Congenital Cardiovascular Interventional Study Consortium ( CCISC ) report Golden Hellenbrand [ 1 ] . The CCISC experience 1989 2005 show true procedural success rate 98.6 % . The patient population subject coarctation aorta . A total 70 subject , child , adolescent adult , enrol 15 study site . Baseline clinical angiographic assessment determine subject 's eligibility enrollment study . Subjects continue study long term annual follow-up 3 , 4 , 5 year .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Aortic Coarctation</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients presence native recurrent coarctation aorta confirm blood pressure gradient , 2Dechocardiography Doppler angiography . Subject weigh minimum 30 kg . The peak pressure gradient ≥20 mmHg systolic blood pressure across coarctation site . Vessels access site accept minimum size 9 French 12 mm balloon 11 French 14 16 mm balloon . Coarctation successfully cross guide wire , sheath device . Diameter transverse arch distal leave subclavian artery 9.5 mm 20 mm diameter . Subject able willing adhere require followup visit test . Subject able willing adhere require followup medication regimen . The physician able access coarctation standard technique . Presence thoracic aortic arterial lesion aneurysms require treatment within 30 day implant procedure . Length coarctation great 45 mm length . Connective tissue genetic disorder , include William , Marfan , Turner , Noonan syndrome . The coarctation adjacent , acute thrombus . The coarctation previously treat stent . Proximity coarctation important side branch result cross side branch Large Diameter Advanta™ V12 Covered Stent device ( e.g . `` jailing '' branch vessel ) . Subject tubular graft , interposition graft , stent graft near coarctation site would interfere delivery , positioning , expansion stabilization Large Diameter Advanta™ V12 Covered Stent Subject contrast agent hypersensitivity adequately premedicated , hypersensitivity stainless steel , expand polytetrafluoroethylene ( ePTFE ) intolerance antiplatelet , anticoagulant , thrombolytic medication . Bloodstream infection Subject pregnant breastfeeding . Subject comorbid illness may result life expectancy le 1 year . The investigator deem subject inappropriate candidate study . Subject participate investigational study new drug , biologic device time study screen . NOTE : Subjects participate long term followup phase previously investigational approve product exclude criterion .</criteria>
