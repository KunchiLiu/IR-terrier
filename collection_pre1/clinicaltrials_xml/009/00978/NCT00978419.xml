	<detailed_description>Infection sepsis major cause morbidity mortality burn patient . Several observational study show HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor , know statin , illness injury result decrease mortality incidence sepsis . We perform pilot retrospective chart review 223 patient admit Vanderbilt University Burn Service 2006-2008 â‰¥55 year age . Patients identify use statin drug prior burn , compare . There significant decrease mortality 83 % ( P=.004 ) statin group 50 % reduction septic shock ( p=.155 ) significant likely due low number patient septic shock ( n=30 ) . These effect unchanged control cardiovascular comorbidities . Animal study also show decreased mortality sepsis pre-injury statin administration . Mechanisms statin effect mortality septic shock attribute so-called pleiotropic effect . If use statins potentially expect reduce mortality , even relevant understand long-term cognitive functional outcome survivor . In last year researcher highlight survivor acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) largely experience cognitive functional decline acute illness . More recently Jackson et al . advocate relationship delirium intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient cognitive impairment ; specifically 1 3 survivor critically illness delirium develop cognitive impairment . Though every year several patient admit burn unit United States , date one small report publish address long-term cognitive outcome burn ICU patient . In preliminary data , Varney et al . find eight patient find significant problem evidence neuropsychological test , activity daily live , relative ' report . The cause development de-novo cognitive impairment population probably multifactorial could link development duration delirium exposure large amount sedatives-analgesics use assure comfort patient ventilator control pain secondary burn . ICU delirium common acute brain dysfunction prevalence high 80 % critically ill surgical medical ICU patient depend severity illness instrument use diagnose delirium . Different risk factor call cause delirium include exposure drug . In particular , previous study show exposure benzodiazepine ( i.e . lorazepam midazolam ) opiates associated transition delirium medical surgical ICU patient . If sedative analgesics widely use medical surgical ICUs , even strike burn unit large amount drug infuse patient comfort pain control . Therefore large exposure drug burn patient potential influence prevalence delirium even . Creatine kinase ( CK ) level know increase serum burn patient . C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) hepatically derive acute phase reactant , elevate burn patient within first 3 day , decrease time . Statins know decrease CRP possibly mitigate inflammatory response due CRP . Rosuvastatin ( Crestor ) choose study drug others pharmacokinetic side effect profile . 1 . Rosuvastatin elimination half-life 19 hour , make suitable day dose . 2 . Rosuvastatin excrete 90 % unchanged stool , 10 % liver . ( Rosuvastatin drug information , package insert ) . 3 . Rosuvastatin , hydrophilic statin , seem associate few side effect lipophilic statin few drug-drug interaction . Rosuvastatin dose 40 mg load dose first day , 20mg mouth feed tube daily . Patients thermal burn recruit admission Vanderbilt University Burn Service within 96 hour time burn . The trial accrue 40 patient admitted Burn Service . Sample size calculation : alpha = 0.05 power = .80 delta= 200- ( .64 * 200 ) =72 ( expect difference statin non-statin subject ) sigma = 80 ( 95 % CI CRP burn patient 3 day ) = 1 ( ratio controls/experimental ) Sample size=20 Informed consent obtain patient surrogate prior enrollment trial . No study procedures do without first obtain informed consent . After informed consent obtain , patient assign Rosuvastatin placebo group random 1:1 basis . The study double blind , neither participant , research staff clinical staff knowledge treatment assignment database lock . Assignment make computer-generated randomization . Placebo inactive tablet provide Vanderbilt Investigational Pharmacy distinguishable appearance Rosuvastatin . Patients consider complete administration study drug follow condition meet : 1 . 28 day randomization 2 . Discharge hospital 3 . Death Because CPK routinely elevate burn patient myopathy statin rare delayed side effect , CKs day 7 treatment use trigger rule withholding/discontinuing study drug . Values great 10 time normal obtain day 7 trigger cessation study drug . Study drug also discontinue patient develops ALT &gt; 8 time upper limit normal study day 1 , patient begin treatment niacin , fenofibrate , cyclosporine , gemfibrozil , lopinavir , ritonavir oral contraceptive . Data collection continue though therapy continue study day 90 . 1 . Demographic data ( age , sex , race ) 2 . Medical history , include cardiovascular comorbidities MI , CVA , arrhythmia , PVD , CHF , HTN , DM , COPD 3 . Time burn injury 4 . Time admission Burn Service 5 . Injury type : burn , burn plus smoke inhalation 6 . Mechanism burn 1. structure fire 2. trauma ( i.e. , MVA ) 3. scald/steam 4. grease 5. contact 6. home oxygen 7. flammable liquid 8. cooking fire 9. brush fire 10. ( describe ) 7 . Extent burn ( % BSA involve ) 8 . Physical assessment 9 . Sedative drug admission , data collect daily . 10 . Ventilator day . 11 . Activities Daily Living ( ADLs ) , Instrumental activity daily live ( IADLs ) 12 . Informant Questionnaire Cognitive Decline Elderly ( IQCODE ) Baseline ( Day 0 ) Assessments The follow information record prior dose . If one value available , close value prior time dose record : serum creatinine , bilirubin , glucose , CK , CRP , PT/PTT/INR pre-albumin . 4.14 Follow-up Assessments The follow lab result record follow timepoints : 1 . Serum CK collect day 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 . 2 . Serum ALT collect day 1 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 . 3 . Serum CRP collect day 3 , 7 , 14 . RASS score assess documented 0800 day +/- 8 hour . ( Appendix B ) Delirium evaluate daily Confusion Assessment Method ICU ( CAM- ICU ) 28 day . ( Appendix C ) Type total amount sedative analgesic drug collect daily 28 day . The ADL 41 Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) evaluate hospital discharge . ( Appendix D ) At 3-month follow-up patient evaluate ADL , IADL , MMSE , Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) , EuroQol . ( Appendix E , F , G ) The use analgesic also collect . Data analyze use STATA 9 statistical program . Demographics , characteristic burn , primary secondary endpoint tabulate compare across Rosuvastatin placebo group . CRP level Rosuvastatin use occurrence septic shock analyze use area curve ( AUC ) . Mortality occurrence septic shock adjust cardiovascular co-morbidities examine use multivariate logistic regression . Potential risk study drug include : 1 . Myopathy , define CK &gt; 10 time ULN , report &lt; .01 % patient , usually reversible discontinuation statin . Rhabdomyolysis , severe myopathy , define CK &gt; 40 time ULN , expect third , lead renal failure myoglobin release , require stop study drug , hydration medical treatment . 2 . Increase liver enzyme ( study ALT &gt; 8 time ULN ) day 1 , report .08 % 4 month statin use , drug interaction . Simple discontinuation drug sufficient evidence liver failure ensue.23 3 . Additional uncommon risk study drug include : headache , nausea , myalgia , asthenia , abdominal pain , dizziness , constipation , package insert . We monitor CK ALT level discontinue study drug define toxicity level reach . CK ALT level meet toxicity level report adverse event . Myopathy note adverse event , stop study drug unless associate CK level define . Adverse Event Recording Each adverse event occur subject / patient , either spontaneously reveal patient / subject observe Investigator , whether believe Investigator relate unrelated study drug , must record adverse event information page CRF patient / subject 's hospital/center note . The Investigator also determine relationship adverse event study drug record appropriate section CRF well intensity , time onset , duration , precaution carry . The Investigator must record adverse event , occur study , regardless relationship study drug occur period without administration study medication . Adverse Event Reporting Investigators ass subject medical record determine adverse experience occur 60 day study hospital discharge , whichever occur first . The investigator determine change laboratory value clinical sign expect course patient burn injury . Always report adverse event : CK &gt; 10 time ULN study day 7 ALT &gt; 8 time ULN study day 1 Serious Adverse Events report accord follow special procedure : The Investigator report SAE 's Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board per policy . All serious adverse event occur association study review study personnel report Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) within 10 day Investigator 's awareness event . Any new information come light may affect subject caregiver 's decision continue participate study pass soon possible . This may also result change consent form review IRB . Serious adverse event also report review data safety monitor . 8.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues The Principal investigator collect data enter password protect computer lock office .
