	<brief_title>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) Imaging Study Adolescents With Anorexia Nervosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals anorexia nervosa ( AN ) aberrant feed behavior , disturbance emotionality impulse control , high rate relapse weight restoration ( Carter et al. , 2004 ; Halmi et al. , 2003 ) . There proven treatment reverse symptom . Although image study individual recover AN ( REC AN ) suggest symptom related dysfunction striatal , insular , prefrontal area , less known biology core symptom currently ill individual ( ILL AN ) . This application use blood oxygen level-dependent ( BOLD ) functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) examine neural substrate underlie appetitive , reward , cognitive dysregulation ill AN . We study 22 adolescent woman currently ill AN 22 healthy adolescent control woman ( CW ) , 14 18 year old . The specific aim project : AIM 1 : The anterior insula ( AI ) , orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) , associate region integrate sensory/hedonic aspect taste interoceptive awareness service homeostasis . We hypothesize restricted eating weight loss occur AN palatable food elicits little reward . AIM 2 : Little life reward individual AN aside weight loss , tend overconcerned future consequence . We predict ill AN show inability discriminate positive negative feedback reflect aberrant anterior ventral striatum ( AVS ) limbic function . AIM 3 : AN tend rigid , inflexible behaviorally inhibit . We use stop task ( Band et al. , 2003 ; Logan et al. , 1984 ; Matthews et al. , 2005 ) characterize neural substrate inhibitory motor control . We hypothesize ill AN , relative CW , show demand-specific alteration fronto-subthalamic circuit necessary motor inhibition ( Aron et al. , 2004 ) . AIM 4 : In exploratory aim , propose examine clinical , cognitive , personality/temperament measure might correlate either BOLD response and/or integrity frontostriatal connectivity determine use diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . Taken together , aim enable u good characterize cognitive limbic dysfunction population . Understanding biologic vulnerability AN critical develop effective treatment intervention often chronic deadly disorder . In addition , lack understanding appropriate methodology necessary address unique problem inherent study ill AN . Thus , project also characterize confound factor , brain volume , energy metabolism , development stage , gonadal steroid , intent future project incorporate methodology need rigorously investigate population .</detailed_description>
