	<brief_title>A Head-to-head Comparison Virtual Reality Treatment Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exposure Therapy ( ET ) current gold standard treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) . Although ET best evidence favor , also clear treatment less perfect achieve remission PTSD . Attempts make improve traditional ET augmenting exposure use Virtual Reality ( VR ) . Open label trial VR assist ET ( VRET ) show method safe effective , suggested remission rate higher normally see ET alone . For treatment phobia , head head comparison traditional ET show VRET superior . For PTSD , trial directly pit VRET traditional ET , traditional therapy , ongoing , already clear individual fail respond traditional ET get good VR add . Lost rush develop VRET , however , direct test signature aspect , VR . There theoretical reason believe VR might enhance ET special way . However reason believe form Augmented Exposure Therapy ( AET ) introduce sight sound trauma would well . VR , although exciting , expensive , cumbersome , available treatment facility . If similar effect could achieve use primitive technology , would open possibility enhance ET much wider range patient . Conversely , VRET show superior simplify AET , would argue unique role VR psychotherapy . Not would theoretically important neuroscientist , would indicate VRET `` platinum '' standard treat PTSD . For past four year , program Naval Medical Center San Diego ( NMCSD ) Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton collaborate VR company researcher build test VR system treat PTSD Service Members return Iraq Afghanistan . NMCSD thus experience perform necessary experiment . The exist equipment also mean NMCSD unique ability carry test without additional input company make VR system . We propose perform randomize , head-to-head study compare VRET AET . We propose perform randomize , head-to-head study compare VRET AET . Up 300 patient would recruit goal treat 40 patient VR 40 patient control ( AET ) therapy . The technique , measure , control would use NMCSD already put place develop VRET PTSD . Also , cost-benefit analysis would use determine benefit VRET .</detailed_description>
