	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( DSC-MRI ) administration ferumoxytol dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI ( DCE-MRI ) administration gadolinium-based contrast agent ( GBCA ) view vessel brain young patient brain tumor . Ferumoxytol experimental form small iron particle take blood stream cell adjacent inside tumor . These iron particle may make easy see area brain affect tumor . Ferumoxytol may work well standard GBCA viewing vessel brain brain tumor MRI . Using ferumoxytol GBCA MRI session may provide information tumor blood supply extent tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DSC-MRI With Ferumoxytol DCE-MRI With Gadolinium Imaging Vascular Properties Younger Patients With Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe vascular property pediatric brain tumor use ferumoxytol DSC-MRI GBCA DCE-MRI pediatric brain tumor ( proven presumptive ) patient single MRI session . II . To describe evolve image characteristic tumor vasculature use DSC-MRI ferumoxytol DCE-MRI GBCA pediatric brain tumor patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare evaluate magnetic resonance angiogram ( MRA ) ferumoxytol different time point . II . To describe number size tumor image . III . To assess histology electron microscopy ( EM ) tissue sample . IV . To demonstrate difference patient prior therapy versus ( vs. ) prior therapy ( radiation and/or chemotherapy ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive ferumoxytol gadolinium intravenously ( IV ) undergo DSC-MRI DCE-MRI . An optional MRI without injection contrast agent may obtain 20-24 hour discretion clinician . Patients may receive 3 scan least 3 week apart 2 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow approximately 4-6 week .</detailed_description>
