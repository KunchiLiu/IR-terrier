	<brief_title>Safety Study Repeated , Escalating Doses Intradermal Avotermin ( Juvista )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study split two Cohorts : A B . Volunteers Cohort A assign one four dose group receive 50 , 100 , 500 1000ng/100μl/3mm punch biopsy . Volunteers assign sequentially order ascend dose . Within dose group volunteer randomise subgroup , b c. Each subject set receive four 3mm punch biopsy , two arm , intradermal injection avotermin , placebo nothing ( standard care ) . On day 0 two 3mm punch biopsy administer local anaesthesia inner aspect one arm subject follow intradermal injection avotermin , placebo nothing . The four subject subgroup receive avotermin one punch biopsy placebo . The four subject subgroup b receive avotermin one punch biopsy standard care . The one subject subgroup c administer intradermal placebo one biopsy standard care . 24 h late application intradermal avotermin , placebo nothing apply . While arm 1 use study arm , arm 2 use safety procedure . Subjects randomise return Day 3 7 excision first two punch biopsy . At time two punch biopsy treatment regime carry second arm . These dose 24 h later excise Day 10 . After determine safety toleration dose Cohort A , new subject assign Cohort B . These allocate ascend order group would receive 1 , 10 , 50 100μg/100μl/3mm punch biopsy , follow procedure use Cohort A . Only first three group reach Day 10 safety data analyse would final volunteer recruit 100μg group .</detailed_description>
