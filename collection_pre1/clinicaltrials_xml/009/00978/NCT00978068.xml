	<brief_summary>HIV malaria major cause morbidity mortality Sub-Saharan Africa child bear great brunt disease . No single exist intervention likely control malaria Africa . Rather , improvement malaria prevention likely come strategy employ multiple proven intervention target different population . HIV-infected child represent one vulnerable subpopulation country . It possible use protease inhibitor ( PI ) - base antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) HIV-infected child live area high malaria transmission could prevent malaria vulnerable population . An effective remedy offer possibility reduce malaria risk , PIs , highly desirable . This study determine whether PI base ART regimen reduce malaria among child live malaria endemic area Uganda receive insecticide-treated bed net ( ITN ) TS . This study compare two different ART regimen . Children enrol study start continue receive either standard Ugandan first line treatment ART regimen ( NNRTI+2 NRTIs ) ART regimen contain HIV protease inhibitor ( lopinavir/ritonavir +2 NRTIs ) follow period 24 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open label , single site , randomize clinical trial compare PI-based ART NNRTI-based ART prevention malaria HIV-infected child . The two ART drug regimen use include : Treatment arm 1 . LPV/r + 2 NRTIs Treatment arm 2 . NVP EFV + 2 NRTIs . The study design test hypothesis child receive PI-based ART regimen low incidence malaria compare child receive NNRTI- base ART regimen . The primary study endpoint study malaria incidence . The study site Tororo District Hospital campus situate Eastern Uganda , area high malaria transmission . Using convenience sampling , 300 HIV-infected child identify Tororo community age 2 month &lt; 11 year either eligible ART-initiation already receive first line ART regimen HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/ml evaluate enrollment . Eligible child randomize enrollment receive either PI- base NNRTI-based ART regimen . At enrollment , study participant receive long lasting ITN part basic care package include safe water vessel multivitamin give TS chemoprophylaxis , per current standard care HIV-infected child Uganda . On day ART initiation , patient counsel importance adherence ART possible ART related toxicity . After 2 week , patient see assess adherence toxicity study medication interview clinical examination . Apart visit week 2 , patient see 4 week interval time ART-initiation . Assessment adherence also do TS prophylaxis , ITN use ART . Assessment adherence ART do self report miss dos pill count . Participants receive routine acute medical care designate study clinic open 7 day week 8 a.m. 5 p.m. Parents/guardians ask bring child study clinic medical care . If hour , instruct bring Tororo District Hospital premise ( study clinic locate ) request study physician on-call contact . They follow least 24 month 3 year . They see monthly routine assessment laboratory evaluation do every 3 month . At visit , study protocol reinforce discussion regard need come study clinic promptly upon onset illness avoid use outside medication . Study participant also follow closely adverse event potentially due study drug malaria HIV treatment outcome . During follow-up period , patient present clinic new episode fever undergo standard evaluation ( history , physical examination ) Giemsa-stained blood smear diagnosis malaria .</detailed_description>
