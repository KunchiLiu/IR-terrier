	<brief_summary>The primary objective study adult advance recurrent solid tumor lymphoma evaluate safety tolerability AR-12 describe dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) , thereby establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , absence reach MTD , recommend dose ( RD ) additional study oral AR-12 administer daily cycle 28 day ( 28 consecutive day daily treatment least 7-day break first second treatment cycle recovery toxicity grade 1 less , plan off-treatment day subsequent cycle ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study AR-12 ( 2-Amino-N-4-5- ( 2 Phenanthrenyl ) -3- ( Trifluoromethyl ) -1H-pyrazol-1-yl Phenyl-Acetamide ) Adult Patients With Advanced Recurrent Solid Tumors Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-agent , open-label , Phase 1 , dose-escalation study adult patient advance recurrent solid tumor lymphoma . Patients receive orally administer AR-12 daily 28 consecutive day . The first dosing cycle follow least 7 day off-treatment period ; however , off-treatment period schedule subsequent treatment cycle . If daily dose tolerate study population , alternative dosing schedule may pursue ( eg , 21 consecutive day dose follow 7 day treatment ) , indicate safety , pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic data ; change protocol-specified dosing schedule must agree upon investigator medical monitor . If individual patient respond AR-12 treatment objective response stable disease accord RECIST criterion meet pre-specified retreatment criterion , may continue receive cycle AR-12 absence untoward serious toxicity ; however , patient permit start subsequent cycle bi-monthly disease evaluation confirm disease progression occur .</detailed_description>
