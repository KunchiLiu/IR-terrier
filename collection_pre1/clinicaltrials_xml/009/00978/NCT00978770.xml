	<brief_title>MRI Predicting Early Response Chemotherapy Patients With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine technical feasibility use MRI multicenter set use commonly available magnetic resonance ( MR ) system ( i.e. , trial able scan patient specific protocol , use different type MRI machine ) measure number MRI scan complete technical specification ( i.e. , incorrect sequence incomplete scan ) trial protocol ( i.e. , scan complete complete wrong time ) . - To determine reliably image data analyze centralized , semi-automated manner ( i.e. , MRI data reliably transfer different center analyze use software base center MR investigation University Hull ) measure number case automate data analysis complete MRI scan possible ( i.e. , data could analyze data require manual analysis ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan baseline , 4-7 day begin first course chemotherapy , end second course chemotherapy , end fourth course chemotherapy ( first regimen ) . MRI technique may include dynamic contrast-enhanced , diffusion-weighted , spectroscopic .</detailed_description>
