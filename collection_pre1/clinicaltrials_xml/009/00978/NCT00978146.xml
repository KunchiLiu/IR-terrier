	<brief_title>Effect Hydroxyurea Treatment Primary Desmoid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment desmoid tumor complicate benign histology potentially aggressive recurrent behavior . Invasive intensive treatment surgery radiation therapy lead good tumor control , expense significant side effect along high risk local recurrence surgical excision . Low dose regimen standard chemotherapy drug favor conservative first-line treatment ; however , refractory recurrent tumor uncommon . The purpose study investigate efficacy safety use hydroxyurea , anti-neoplastic agent relatively side-effects , novel treatment primary , unresectable desmoid tumor , desmoid tumor incomplete primary resection , desmoid tumor recur therapy . Patients present oncology center new diagnosis desmoid tumor , recurrent desmoid tumor , eligible study . After informed consent , physical examination , baseline imaging study ( CT/MRI ) , patient receive oral hydroxyurea start dose 20 mg/kg daily . Laboratory test perform set interval maintain appropriate dose monitor cytopenia . Clinical evaluation , physical examination , and/or image study conduct every three month ass change tumor size . Patients remain hydroxyurea long response stability tumor size associate toxicity manageable . Data collect regard response drug , duration response , occurrence adverse event . The goal analysis determine efficacy hydroxyurea treatment modality desmoid tumor .</detailed_description>
