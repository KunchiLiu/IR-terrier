	<brief_summary>The ultimate goal study find association specific polymorphism candidate gene medication response attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) patient . These result lead investigator ' team : ( 1 ) resolve controversy inconsistent finding previous pharmacogenetic study ; ( 2 ) study medication effect neuropsychological function useful candidate endophenotypes ADHD ; ( 3 ) delineate nature effect gene-gene interaction drug response ADHD patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The science pharmacogenetics seek identify pattern genetic variation direct individually tailor treatment regimen enhance long-term adherence . Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , characterize inattention , hyperactivity impulsivity , early onset , highly heritable , clinically heterogeneous , long-term impair disorder tremendous impact individual , family , society . It affect 5-10 % school-aged child worldwide ( 7.5 % Taiwan ) 2-4 % adult . Although efficacy medication ADHD well demonstrate clinical trial , substantial number patient fail remain therapy , tremendous variability tolerability treatment acceptance . An understanding genetic predictor ADHD medication response likely influence future clinical treatment , inform research treatment-resistant ADHD patient , identify patient increase risk significant treatment related adverse event . Although interest ADHD pharmacogenetics encourage , conflict result previous study may reflect genetic heterogeneity difference phenotype , medication response ADHD child likely result combine effect several potential gene . In addition , categorical measure treatment effect retrospective study design may sensitive enough pick statistically significant difference treatment response base genotype . Further prospective study include quantitative measure medication response warrant . Specific Aims : 1. ass specific genetic moderator methylphenidate atomoxetine response use repeat outcome measurement ; 2. examine association genetic polymorphism medication effect neuropsychological function ; 3. identify gene-gene interaction pharmacogenetics ADHD . Subjects Methods : We recruit 160 drug-naïve ADHD patient 80 match normal control , age 7-18 . The patient randomly assign two treatment group , OROS-methylphenidate group ( n=80 ) atomoxetine group ( n=80 ) , respectively . After complete assessment baseline administration either OROs-methylphenidate atomoxetine , patient ADHD reassess Week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 mainly vital sign , behavioral symptom , psychosocial function evaluation use SNAP-IV , YSR , CBCL , CGI-ADHD-S , CGI-ADHD-I , SAICA , Family APGAR-C. Neuropsychological test , include CPT , Time Perception Tasks , CANTAB , perform Week 4 16 . The DNA collect , candidate gene ( DAT1 , DRD4 , DRD5 , SLC6A2 , SLC6A4 ) hypothesize influence medication effect individual risk ADHD genotyped . Anticipated Results : We anticipate study delineate pharmacogenetics ADHD determine association medication response genetic variant Taiwanese sample . The finding different approach identify effect genotype drug response study help u extend understanding genetic basis ADHD . Development individualized medication regimen base patient genetic variability might lead optimized symptom reduction , improve tolerability , concomitant improvement patient adherence . Conversely , patient increase genetic risk treatment failure significant adverse effect could spar exposure certain compound unlikely benefit . Pharmacogenetics also potential role development new compound ADHD therapy . The use genetic screening dose provide model future drug development , outcome variability assess genetic subgroup merely basis treatment assignment .</detailed_description>
