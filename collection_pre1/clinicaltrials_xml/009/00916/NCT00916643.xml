	<brief_summary>The objective post-surveillance study continue evaluate safety effectiveness H.E.L.P . System . The safety effectiveness assess evaluate occurrence death , cardiovascular event intervention , angina , serious unanticipated adverse effect . Laboratory assessment make document low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) reduction effect blood component . Quality life assessment also make . The study also assess modification H.E.L.P . System , include : - use single heparin adsorber , instead two small adsorbers ; - change supplier ultrafilter ( Secon Toray ) ; - reduction number blood line eleven nine ; - change single-layer two-layer precipitate filter . The safety efficacy device specific modification evaluate compare safety efficacy data patient registry data initial clinical study device originally design .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Density Lipoprotein ( LDL ) Apheresis Using H.E.L.P . Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>H.E.L.P . therapy indicate use treat patient familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) undergo six month optimal diet drug therapy whose LDL-C level remain &gt; 300 mg/dl absence CHD &gt; 200 mg/dl document CHD . These patient divide three subgroup interest : - Group A : functional hypercholesterolemic homozygote LDL-C &gt; 500mg/dl ; - Group B : functional hypercholesterolemic heterozygote LDL-C &gt; 300mg/dl ; - Group C : functional hypercholesterolemic heterozygote LDL-C &gt; 200mg/dl documented CHD . Optimal diet therapy define received instruction train dietitian use diet meeting National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) Step 2 criterion ( &lt; 30 % calorie fat , &lt; 7 % calorie saturate fat , &lt; 200 mg dietary cholesterol per day ) . Optimal drug therapy define try least two separate class effective serum LDL-C lowering agent ( &gt; 15 % reduction ) currently available least six month . These drug include hydroxy methyl glutaryl ( HMG ) CoA reductase inhibitor , fibric acid derivative , niacin , anion exchange resin . These agent use combination maximal dos tolerate patient supervision treat physician monitor side effect . Documented coronary heart disease ( CHD ) include documentation coronary heart disease coronary angiography history myocardial infarction ( MI ) , coronary artery bypass surgery ( CABG ) , percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) alternative revascularization procedure ( e.g. , atherectomy stent ) , progressive angina document exercise non-exercise stress test . The primary criterion evaluate safety effectiveness device : - Occurrence Death - cardiovascular death - non-cardiovascular death - Occurrence Cardiovascular Events - MI - stroke - unstable angina - transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) - congestive heart failure - pulmonary embolism - arrhythmia - peripheral vascular disease - hypertension - Occurrence Surgical Non-Surgical Intervention Procedure Treatment Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ( ASCVD ) include : - coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery - peripheral vascular bypass surgery - percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) - percutaneous transluminal coronary artery bypass graft angioplasty - percutaneous transluminal peripheral angioplasty ( PTA ) - coronary atherectomy ( device ) - coronary artery bypass graft atherectomy ( device ) - peripheral atherectomy ( device ) - carotid endarterectomy ( non-device ) - peripheral endarterectomy ( non-device ) - coronary artery laser surgery - coronary artery bypass graft laser surgery - peripheral vascular laser surgery - coronary artery stent placement - coronary artery bypass graft stent placement - peripheral vascular stent placement - repair atherosclerotic aortic arterial aneurysm - limb amputation ASCVD - Frequency severity CHD Symptoms : - chest pain ( angina ) , - shortness breath - claudication - Use CHD Medications treatment : - angina - heart failure - arrhythmia - hypertension - hyperlipidemia - Use Lipid-Lowering Medications Other Cardiovascular Medications Concomitantly - Laboratory Assessments ( lipid , lipoprotein , chemistry , clot factor ) - Quality life assessment ( SF-36 ) - Occurrence Serious and/or Unanticipated Adverse Events Reported During Treatment ( e.g. , hypotension , nausea , vomit , syncope ) - Occurrence serious illness - Acute Reduction LDL-C</detailed_description>
