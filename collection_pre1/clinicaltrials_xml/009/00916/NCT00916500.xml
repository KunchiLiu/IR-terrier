	<brief_summary>Concurrent chemoradiation ( CCRT ) standard therapy locally advanced cervical cancer . However , effective chemotherapy regimen controversial . Weekly cisplatin , hydroxyurea + cisplatin , 5-FU + cisplatin test clinical trial . Weekly cisplatin need frequent hospital visit poor compliance profile korea . Combination chemotherapy regimens adverse effect weekly cisplatin without improve outcome . We conduct retrospective analysis compare weekly cisplatin cisplatin every 3 week observe favorable outcome cisplatin every 3 week regimen ( still publish ) . Therefore , design phase 2 trial evaluate efficacy feasibility CCRT cisplatin every 3 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concurrent Chemoradiation With Cisplatin Every 3 Week Advanced Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical carcinoma one common gynecologic cancer worldwide . The prognosis cervical cancer favorable , approximately 80-90 % 5-year survival rate early-stage disease . However , advanced disease carry poor prognosis . Current standard treatment locally advanced cervical cancer , eligible surgical treatment , cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiation . On basis result five randomized clinical trial , consistently show improved survival patient treat cisplatin-based chemoradiation , U.S. National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) announce 1992 `` Strong consideration give incorporation concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy radiotherapy woman require radiotherapy treatment cervical cancer '' . Although recently report meta-analyses also demonstrate improved local control rate survival cisplatin-based chemotherapy concurrent radiation , optimal cisplatin dose dosing schedule still undetermined . Among previous five randomized clinical trial , two trial perform Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) use weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 three trial use tri-weekly cisplatin dosage range 50 mg/m2 75 mg/m2 combine 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) . Despite diversity cisplatin dose dosing schedule , weekly cisplatin dose 40 mg/m2 concurrent RT widely accept standard regimen CRT convenience , equal effectiveness , favorable toxicity comparison 5-FU combined regimen . However weekly cisplatin regimen need frequent hospital visit poor compliance profile korea . With weekly cisplatin regimen , plan treatment complete 58 % patient adn treatment delay 29 % patient . among patient , 9 % patient relate associated toxicity . To overcome toxicity poor compliance weekly regimen , investigator try evaluate efficacy feasibility CCRT cisplatin 75mg/m2 every 3 week .</detailed_description>
