	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safety study drug pemetrexed , high dose drug give people safely . Another goal research study gain information body handle pemetrexed pemetrexed may work treat participant 's lymphoma nervous system . Pemetrexed ( also know Alimta ) approve FDA treatment lung cancer show effective laboratory study . Information study suggest pemetrexed may help treat patient either primary secondary central nervous system lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Recurrent Primary Secondary Central Nervous System ( CNS ) Lymphoma With ALIMTA ( Pemetrexed )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Since look high dose pemetrexed give people safely , everyone participates study receive amount study drug . The dose participant receive depend upon number people enrol study well tolerate dos study drug . - Pemetrexed give vein ( IV ) 10 20 minute period every 14 day . This 14 day period call cycle study treatment . - Study treatment divide three phase . Induction : Participants give maximum 8 cycle . If participant achieve complete response eight induction cycle , take study . A complete response mean evidence disease MRI CT scan . Consolidation : If participant achieve complete response , two additional cycle . Maintenance : Following completion consolidation cycle , participant receive study drug per month . They continue receive maintenance cycle year start first induction cycle . - Folic acid vitamin B12 two vitamin show help lessen severity side effect pemetrexed . Participants begin take oral folic acid tablet least 5 day first dose pemetrexed daily 3 week last dose . Vitamin B12 give injection muscle . Participants receive first vitamin B12 injection 1-2 week first dose pemetrexed . They receive injection every 9 week . - Corticosteroids dexamethasone show help prevent severe skin rash associate pemetrexed . Participants receive dexamethasone twice daily start day pemetrexed infusion continue day infusion . - On day 1 cycle follow perform : physical examination , blood work , vital sign , assessment well participant functioning , mini-mental examination . On day 8 cycle blood work perform . - Research blood work obtain ( PKs ) first four day cycle 1 2 ( study participation day 1-4 15-18 ) . - Participants come clinic month maintenance cycle physical examination , blood work , assessment well participant functioning , vital sign mini-mental examination . - Tumor assessment MRI do every 2 cycle induction consolidation cycle . During maintenance cycle MRIs repeat every 2 cycle ( every 2 month ) . - Collection cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) research test also likely perform , safe , learn well pemetrexed cross blood-brain barrier . This perform one two method 6 24 hour pemetrexed infuse day 1 2 first two cycle . - After Alimta give also receive , white blood cell recruit material , Neupogen avoid suppress bone marrow .</detailed_description>
