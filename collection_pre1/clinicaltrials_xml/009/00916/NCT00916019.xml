	<brief_summary>The investigator previously show mild exercise training level lactate threshold ( LT ) intensity ( 60 min/day , 5 days/week ) improve peripheral insulin sensitivity insulin-independent glucose disposal glucose effectiveness , without change body weight body fat ( Nishida et al , Diabetes Care , 2001 ; Nishida et al , Diabetes , 2004 ) . Thus beneficial effect likely related number adaptation occur skeletal muscle response exercise . In current study , investigator hypothesise single bout mild exercise perform LT would physiological stimulator skeletal muscle PGC-1alpha gene , repetition exercise stimulate PGC-1alpha gene ( i.e. , train ) 12 week would induce coordinate increase large number metabolic gene , well gene potentially important prevention insulin resistance metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>
