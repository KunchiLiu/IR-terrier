	<brief_summary>Smoking lead cause preventable morbidity mortality US . While approximately 70 % smoker attempt quit year , 5-15 % maintain abstinence 12 month , even effective pharmacological psychological intervention . Novel therapy need smoke cessation relapse prevention . Previous study show early post-cessation crave urge smoke powerful predictor relapse . A current model pathogenesis addiction maintain substance abuse cause marked increase release phasic dopamine release , turn strengthens increase salience memory drug experience , lead powerful persistent memory easily activate , lead drug crave often drug use . This highly salient memory also implicate physiological arousal associate crave response smoke cue . This process think implicate relapse drug use even long period abstinence . Recent animal research indicate retrieval return consolidated memory associate drug craving , labile state must restabilized persist process term reconsolidation . If memory drug-related experience labile reactivate , could represent window opportunity memory drug use underlies drug crave influence pharmacologically . Our hypothesis post-reactivation administration B-adrenergic blocker , propranolol , follow retrieval drug-associated memory reduce strength salience memory influence reconsolidation , process call memory reconsolidation blockade . In study test hypothesis single dose propranolol give one hour prior smoking-related cue exposure ( post-reactivation treatment ) decrease psychophysiological response smoke cue one week later predict clinical response ensue series 6 post-reactivation treatment script-driven imagery propranolol . In order , propose conduct randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial post-reactivation treatment propranolol 50 adult smoker . Outcome measure include physiological response smoking-related cue one six post-reactivation treatment smoke behavior treatment 3-month follow-up period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS 1 . To evaluate , current smoker , efficacy single dose study medication give hour prior smoking-related cue exposure ( post-reactivation treatment ) psychophysiological response smoking cue one week later . 2 . To evaluate , smoke cessation process , clinical effect study medication ensue series 6 post-reactivation treatment psychophysiologic response smoking cue measure one week last post-reactivation treatment . 3 . To evaluate whether medication effect psychophysiologic response single memory reactivation session script-driven imagery predict clinical response ensue series 6 post-reactivation treatment script-driven imagery study medication . 4. . To assess whether single post-reactivation treatment series six post-reactivation treatment associate reduction self-reported craving cigarette assess Tiffany QSU . 5 . To assess whether series six post-reactivation treatment associate reduction smoke assess self-report cigarette smoke per day expire air Carbon monoxide . To achieve aim , conduct double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial convenience sample 50 smoker .</detailed_description>
