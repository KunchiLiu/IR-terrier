	<brief_summary>The purpose research study study effect stop aromatase inhibitory ( AI ) therapy breast cancer progression . Aromatase inhibitor class drug use treat breast cancer postmenopausal woman . They work decrease level estrogen , believe stimulate growth tumor tissue . Breast cancer progress despite therapy AI think resistant AI therapy . There scientific evidence suggest resistant breast cancer cell learn grow low level estrogen present AI therapy increase estrogen level even slightly stop AI therapy inhibit breast cancer cell . An improvement stabilization breast cancer observe stop therapy tamoxifen , different anti-estrogen therapy , report literature stop AI therapy . This research study first study formally test rate disease improvement ( response ) stabilization stop AI therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Drug Withdrawal Women With Progressive Breast Cancer While Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants follow test procedures do 8 week , 16 week , 24 week stop AI therapy : Physical examination ; blood test ; tumor assessment physical exam ( possible ) ; chest x-ray CT scan chest ; CT scan abdomen pelvis ; bone scan . - After week 24 , procedure repeat every 12 week participant study .</detailed_description>
