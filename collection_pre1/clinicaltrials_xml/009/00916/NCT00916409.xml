	<brief_title>Effect NovoTTF-100A Together With Temozolomide Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme ( GBM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PAST CLINICAL EXPERIENCE : The effect electric field generate NovoTTF-100A device ( TTFields , TTF ) test large prospective , randomized trial , recurrent GBM . The outcome subject treat NovoTTF-100A device compare treated effective best standard care chemotherapy ( include bevacizumab ) . NovoTTF-100A subject comparable overall survival subject receive best available chemotherapy US today . Similar result show comparability NovoTTF-100A BSC chemotherapy see secondary endpoint . Recurrent GBM patient treat NovoTTF-100A device trial experience few side effect general , significantly few treatment related side effect , significantly low gastrointestinal , hematological infectious adverse event compare control . The device-related adverse event see mild moderate skin irritation beneath device electrode . Finally , quality life measure well NovoTTF-100A subject group compare subject receive effective best standard care chemotherapy . In small scale pilot trial newly diagnose GBM patient , treatment well tolerate suggest NovoTTF-100A may improve time disease progression overall survival newly diagnose GBM patient . Although number patient pilot trial small , The FDA determine data gather far warrant test NovoTTF-100A treatment possible therapy patient newly diagnose GBM . DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL : All patient include trial newly diagnose GBM patient underwent biopsy surgery ( without Gliadel wafer ) , follow radiation therapy combination Temozolomide chemotherapy . In addition , patient must meet eligibility criterion . Eligible patient randomly assign one two group : 1 . Treatment NovoTTF-100A device combination Temozolomide chemotherapy . 2 . Treatment Temozolomide alone , best know standard care . Patients randomize 2:1 ratio ( 2 every three patient participate trial treat NovoTTF-100A device ) . Baseline test perform patient enrolled arm , include specific genetic test do use tumor sample obtain initial surgery . If assign NovoTTF-100A combination Temozolomide group , patient treat continuously device second progression . They also receive temozolomide possibly second line treatment one following : re-operation , local radiotherapy ( gamma-knife ) , second line chemotherapy combination . NovoTTF-100A treatment consist wear four electrically insulated electrode array head . Electrode array placement require shave scalp frequently treatment . After initial short visit clinic training monitoring , patient release continue treatment home maintain regular daily routine . During trial , regardless treatment group patient assign , need return every month clinic examination physician routine laboratory examination do . These routine visit continue long patient 's disease progress second time study treatment . If occurs , patient need return per month two month clinic similar follow examination . During visit clinic patient examine physically neurologically . Additionally , routine blood test perform . A routine MRI head perform baseline every second month thereafter , second progression . After follow plan , patient contact per month telephone answer basic question health status . SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND : Electric field exert force electric charge similar way magnet exerts force metallic particle within magnetic field . These force cause movement rotation electrically charge biological building block , much like alignment metallic particle see along line force radiate outwards magnet . Electric field also cause muscle twitch strong enough may heat tissue . TTFields alternate electric field low intensity . This mean change direction repetitively many time second . Since change direction rapidly ( 200 thousand time second ) , cause muscle twitch , effect electrically activate tissue body ( brain , nerve heart ) . Since intensity TTFields body low , cause heating . The breakthrough finding make NovoCure finely tune alternate field low intensity , term TTFields ( Tumor Treating Fields ) , cause significant slow growth cancer cell . Due unique geometric shape cancer cell multiply , TTFields cause building block cell move pile way cell physically explode . In addition , cancer cell also contain miniature building block act tiny motor move essential part cell place place . TTFields cause tiny motor fall apart since special type electric charge . As result two effect , cancer tumor growth slow even reverse continuous exposure TTFields . Other cell body ( normal healthy tissue ) affect much less cancer cell since multiply much slow rate . In addition TTFields direct certain part body , leave sensitive area reach . In conclusion , TTField hold promise serve brand new cancer treatment side effect promise affectivity slow reverse disease .</detailed_description>
