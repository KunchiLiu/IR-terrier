	<brief_summary>This study aim compare two different follow regimen different test intensity endometrial cancer treat patient . If eligibility criterion satisfy write informed consensus obtain , patient stratify inside centre accord risk level : - Group 1 : patient low risk recurrence [ stage IA G1 stage IA G2 ] - Group 2 : patient high-risk recurrence [ â‰¥ stage IA G3 ] ( Ethics Committee amendment 14th September 2010 , use new 2010 FIGO classification endometrial cancer ! ) In group patient randomize two regimen follow : 1 . Minimalist ( Arm 1 ) 2 . Intensive ( Arm 2 ) Features arm list `` Arms '' item .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Between Two Follow Regimens With Different Test Intensity Endometrial Cancer Treated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The procedure centralize randomization , block variable length , take place within layer 1:1 ratio implement within centralized database , sequence generate dedicated software . The recruitment randomization register website ( www.epiclin.cpo.it ) later 20 day histological examination receive . If patient need kind adjuvant therapy start follow-up program accord regimen choose randomization , adjuvant therapy need patient first register randomization deferred end treatment . In presence symptom sign detect clinical visit may suppose recurrence presence abnormal test , clinician prescribe medical test examination require . The test carry addition follow-up schedule program must report database . Nevertheless patient continue follow assessment performance status 5 year , follow-up schedule clinician . An interim analysis schedule 3.5 year start begin recruitment ( base approximately 1 / 3 total expect event , 4 / 5 case already enrol ) . Patients stratify recruitment Center , level risk ( calculate accord stage disease , histotype grading ) type treatment perform . The focus study : - Compare effect two FU regimens 5-years OS - Evaluate difference diagnosis anticipation - Evaluate difference term recurrences - Describe compliance QoL patient - Evaluate cost-effectiveness cost-utility</detailed_description>
