	<brief_summary>Aim project customize choice strong opioid treatment cancer chronic pain identification patient clinical history pain characteristic , moreover analysis investigator also correlate clinical efficacy safety opioid treatment pharmacokinetic pharmacogenetic pattern order identify variable able predict efficacy treatment patient susceptibility towards specific treatment . Furthermore study investigator want identify pharmacogenomic characterization responsible pharmacokinetic variability conversion morphine opioids , order validate currently available conversion table pharmacokinetic viewpoint , estimate influence common genetic polymorphism , characterization could useful cost-effective . This study also focus specific clinical-pharmacological response elderly male female interaction opioids anticonvulsant antidepressant drug routinely use pain therapy ( study pharmacovigilance ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study About Clinical Pharmacogenetic Safety Opioid Use Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain continue major problem patient cancer , affect 25 % 30 % patient recently diagnose cancer . The incidence pain advance stage cancer approach 70 % 80 % . There number reason patient cancer experience chronic pain either related disease treatment . Cancer spread metastasis direct invasion , 90 % patient metastasis osseous structure report pain . Patients cancer neuropathic pain due direct compression nerve plexus spinal cord involvement . Inadequate treatment undertreatment associate increase pain score , decrease functional ability , increase depression anxiety . Opioid administration though proven effective still meet resistance healthcare operator , seldom willing prescribe drug , patient , tend take many false belief still related opioids . It well demonstrate literature opioids effective control acute chronic pain nociceptive and/or neuropathic origin . Switching type opioid and/or administration route ( e.g. , oral neuraxial ) also know important factor long-term treatment : appropriate conversion table elucidate drug equipotence different potency base administration route different opioids currently available therefore devise validated clinical setting . There several attempt define guideline treatment protocol even recent meta-analyses indicate morphine remain gold standard . However , general consensus still lack , opioid management depend type cause pain , also patient 's history , pain characteristic genetic pattern . Which , , best opioid , relation previous character , start systemic treatment remain therefore debate . The different effect different opioids spinal cord sensitization result continuous peripheral nociceptive stimulus long term administration also partially investigate . Current pharmacogenetic publication analyze pharmacokinetic behavior opioids short-term administration , study still lack pharmacokinetics analgesic effect vary repeat administration opioids , especially direct comparison clinical response . Genetic study show difference result opioid treatment relate variability gene role pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetics opioids . Regardless study , literature yet investigate quantitative qualitative variability gene product influence efficacy toxicity specific opioid treatment .</detailed_description>
