	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose vorinostat give together fludarabine phosphate , cyclophosphamide , rituximab see well work treat patient previously untreated B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) . Vorinostat may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , fludarabine phosphate cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , may block cancer growth different way target certain cell . Giving vorinostat together fludarabine phosphate , cyclophosphamide , rituximab may better treatment CLL SLL .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) vorinostat combine fludarabine ( fludarabine phosphate ) , cyclophosphamide rituximab ( FCR ) patient previously untreated CLL/SLL . II . To evaluate potential efficacy term 2-year FCR plus vorinostat induction follow rituximab plus vorinostat maintenance therapy previously untreated CLL/SLL patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To eliminate residual disease ( document flow cytometry and/or polymerase chain reaction [ PCR ] ) patient achieve complete response ( CR ) FCR plus vorinostat . II . To estimate rate conversion partial response ( PR ) CR FCR plus vorinostat . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study vorinostat follow phase II study . INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) daily day 1-5 8-12 ; cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute fludarabine phosphate IV 30-60 minute day 1-3 ; rituximab IV day 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4-6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Beginning 3 month completion induction therapy , patient receive vorinostat PO day 1-14 rituximab IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 month 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
