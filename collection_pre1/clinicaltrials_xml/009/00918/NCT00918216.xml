	<brief_title>Spectroscopy Breast Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine whether laser spectroscopy breast tissue perform ex vivo effectively distinguish benign malignant breast tumor woman undergo needle biopsy surgical excision breast lesion identify clinically . OUTLINE : Patients undergo tissue sample collection via needle biopsy surgical excision breast lesion . A radiogram sample may obtain identify target area spectroscopic evaluation . The freshly excise breast tissue sample analyze ex vivo fluorescence , reflectance , and/or Raman spectroscopy . After completion spectroscopic examination , tissue sample submit diagnostic pathologic evaluation . Hematoxylin eosin stain section tissue sample examine light microscopy histopathological analysis . The result pathological examination compare spectroscopic finding radiological finding ( biopsy perform suspect lesion mammography ) determine correlation establish spectroscopic technique provide useful diagnostic information . Additional histochemical , immunohistochemical , fluorescence situ stain may perform support diagnosis well understand spectroscopy result . Patients ' medical chart review obtain clinical information ( e.g. , age , sex , race ; result pathology report report ancillary study , include estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , HER-2 receptor testing , surgical specimen study related surgical specimen ; menstrual status date last menstrual period ; clinical history breast mass abnormal mammogram relate mammography report ; clinical history hormone replacement therapy , birth control pill , oophorectomy ; clinical history chemotherapy adjuvant therapy breast cancer ) .</detailed_description>
