	<brief_summary>Background : Multiple study find Atomoxetine ( Strattera ) efficacious one publish study specifically design evaluate efficacy school setting . In 7 week placebo-controlled study , Atomoxetine ( ATX ) mean dose 1.3 mg/kg , significantly reduce teacher rat ADHD symptom ( Weiss et al. , 2005 ) . However , child typically refer treatment `` real life '' problem function , symptom ( Pelham , Fabiano , &amp; Massetti , 2005 ) . While ATX find produce functional improvement home , Weiss study find limited result area school . Furthermore , almost research examined effect combine ATX behavior therapy ( BT ) . In MTA , add BT stimulant improve teacher rating hyperactivity/impulsivity increase number subject reach optimal response ( Swanson et al. , 2001 ) . Therefore , possible addition BT ATX may improve functional performance classroom . The effect combine therapy may even large ATX monotherapy nonstimulants produce small effect size stimulant . Objective : The primary objective evaluate effect ATX alone combination BT school function 56 child age 6-12 ADHD . Outcomes assess use traditional symptom measure well functional measure academic behavioral improvement classroom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective evaluate 8 week open label trial half participant randomly assign receive ( ATX+BT ) rest receive ATX . An open label design employ efficacy ATX ADHD symptom establish ensure patient receive least one active treatment . Parents ATX+BT group attend eight week parent course use Community Oriented Parent Education ( COPE ) program ( Cunningham , Bremner , &amp; Secord , 1998 ) child participate eight week social skill course . Teachers implement Daily Report Card ( DRC ) track classroom behavior . In BT group , child 's DRC performance communicate daily parent tie consequence home school . In ATX group , parent provide DRCs . The ATX dose protocol follow : .5mg/kg per day day 1-3 , .8mg/kg/day day 4-7 , 1.2mg/kg day 8+ . After 3 week , subject eligible increase 1.8mg/kg/day . ATX dose morning could dose BID address tolerability . The mean final dose 1.4mg/kg/day . To enrol , child must IQ &gt; 75 , fail trial ATX , meet DSM criterion ADHD psychiatric comorbidities except ODD/CD good physical health . Children already take ADHD medication enrol average symptom score ADHD subscale Disruptive Behaviors Disorders ( DBD ) scale &gt; 2 ( moderate impairment ) . ADHD confirm parent report DISC DBD , rate DSM 3R IV symptom ODD , CD ODD 0-3 likert scale . Subjects also require evidence ADHD symptom classroom rat IOWA Conners . Psychiatric comorbidities assess use DISC . Measures treatment response include : 1 . Parents teacher rating IOWA Conners : 10 item Likert rating measure child 's inattention-overactive-impulsive oppositional-defiant behavior ( Milich , Loney , &amp; Landau , 1982 ) 2 . Parent teacher rating Impairment Rating Scale ( IRS ) : 8 item use visual-analogue scale measure child 's functional impairment peer relationship , adult-child relationship , academic performance , classroom behavior , self esteem ( Fabiano et al. , 2006 ) . 3 . Parent teacher side effect rating use structured list common side effect see ATX model Pittsburgh Side Effects Rating Scale ( Pelham , 1993 ) . 4 . Direct observation subject measure rule violation on/off task behavior use modify version COCADD system ( Atkins , Pelham &amp; Licht , 1988 ) train observer watch child classroom 30 minute , record rule violation off-task behavior . 5 . Parent teacher rating Social Skills Rating Scale ( SSRS ) : measure teacher ' parent perception child 's social academic skill overall problem behavior ( Gresham &amp; Elliott , 1990 ) .</detailed_description>

The presence Oppositional Defiant Disorder ( ODD ) , Conduct Disorder ( CD ) learn disability result exclusion study commonly occur comorbidities find moderate response ADHD treatment ( Jensen et al. , 2001 ) . Enrollment special education service also exclusionary criterion work research group find service affect response ADHD treatment ( Niemic , Fabiano , Pelham , &amp; Fuller , 2002 ) .</criteria>
