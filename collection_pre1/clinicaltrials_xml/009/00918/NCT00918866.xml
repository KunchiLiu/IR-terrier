	<brief_title>A Study Commercial DEFINITY® Monitor Effects Heart 's Pulmonary Artery Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase IV safety study provide safety data potential systemic pulmonary hemodynamic effect cause administration DEFINITY® patient undergo right heart cardiac catheterization clinical reason . Using right heart catheter direct measurement pulmonary artery hemodynamics allow accurate assessment potential alteration pulmonary vasculature . This investigated inclusion two patient population , one baseline pulmonary artery pressure &lt; 35 mmHg , one elevate baseline pulmonary artery pressure . The addition immune parameter measurement assess potential link systemic pulmonary alteration potential immune reaction follow DEFINITY® administration . The inclusion patient study base required echocardiogram DEFINITY® administration patient would expose unjustifiable risk invasive right heart catheterization unlikely consent procedure . Therefore , patient undergoing heart catheterization clinical reason , patient undergo pulmonary artery hemodynamic assessment enrol receive DEFINITY® study .</detailed_description>
