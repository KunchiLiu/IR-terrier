	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis bacterium ( TB ) germ infect part human body , especially lung . Vitamin D hormone present human regulate blood electrolyte calcium phosphate . There new information link vitamin D function immune system . The purpose study find vitamin D affect immune system patient TB . We want find correct low vitamin D level , addition get standard therapy TB , help immune system fight TB infection effectively . The study do Georgia National Center Tuberculosis Lung Diseases ( NCTBLD ) Tbilisi , Republic Georgia . 220 patient tuberculosis 80 family member household contact patient tuberculosis participate study . TB patient , already receive standard TB therapy , randomly assign either receive Vitamin D pill placebo total sixteen week .

	<detailed_description>This double-blind , randomize , control clinical trial clinical efficacy antimicrobial mechanism oral high dose vitamin D3 therapy three time weekly give 8 week follow vitamin D dose give every week subsequent 8 week ( n=129 ) versus placebo ( n=129 ) newly diagnose Georgian patient pulmonary TB . The trial also design obtain needed information vitamin D status general nutritional status TB patient Georgia , explore vitamin D regulation endogenous antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin/LL-37 human tissue , obtain hypothesis-generating data potential role cathelicidin/LL-37 mechanism anti-mycobacterial effect vitamin D human . The potential study subject identify clinically monitored clinical study coordinator diagnosis standard method ( compatible sign symptom , positive sputum AFB smear culture , chest X-ray ) . Medical record patient newly diagnose tuberculosis register treatment NCTBLD Tbilisi screen eligibility participation study . Written inform consent obtain patient meet eligibility criterion agree participate study prior subject undergo study-related procedure . Participation study involve total seven study visit ( one baseline six follow visit . TB patient otherwise conventionally treat anti-TB drug regimen use DOTS protocol : initial 2 month in-hospital intensive phase daily treatment oral rifampicin , isoniazid , pyrazinamide ethambutol , follow outpatient continuation phase 4 month rifampicin isoniazid , give 3 time per week . Given data TB disease associate vitamin D depletion also recruit 80 otherwise healthy , adult family member pulmonary TB patient pilot substudy .
