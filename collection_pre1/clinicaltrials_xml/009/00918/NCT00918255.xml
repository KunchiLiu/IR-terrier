	<brief_title>Study Adalimumab Subjects With Moderate Severe Chronic Hidradenitis Suppurativa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled multicenter study consist 2 treatment period : 16-week double-blind , placebo-controlled period ( Period 1 : Weeks 0 end Week 15 ) follow 36-week open-label period ( Period 2 : Weeks 16 52 ) . Participants randomize 1:1:1 ratio base Hurley Stage stratification factor receive adalimumab 40 mg every week ( qwk ) , adalimumab 40 mg every week ( eow ) , match placebo Period 1 . During Period 2 , participant receive open-label adalimumab 40 mg eow option escalate 40 mg weekly dose Week 28 Week 31 participant Physician 's Global Assessment moderate disease worse ( score great equal 3 ) . The primary objective study determine clinical efficacy safety participant moderate severe chronic hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS ) 16 week treatment . The secondary objective evaluate maintenance efficacy continue safety adalimumab additional 36 week treatment . ( Note : Hurley Stage classification system skin involvement largely base presence extent abscess formation accompany scar sinus tract . Hurley Stages I [ abscess formation without scar sinus tract ] , II [ widely separate recurrent abscess scar sinus tract ] , III [ multiple interconnect abscess sinus tract across entire area ] . Randomization study perform use stratification Hurley Stage [ III versus ( I II ) . ) At present time , Period 1 double-blind data provide ; additional information provide analysis open-label Period 2 complete .</detailed_description>
