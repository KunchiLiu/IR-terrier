	<brief_summary>Heat Intolerance ( HI ) life threaten deficiency lead heat exhaustion , heat stroke ( possibly death ) large number military civilian occupational group . We demonstrate malfunction transcriptional pathways heat stress HI phenotype alter gene expression profile compare Heat Tolerant ( HT ) individual . Such difference evident even normothermic basal/comfort condition . Heat exercise challenge heat tolerance test ( HTT ) emphasize difference group , particularly recovery comfort temperature . Our result indicate may possible identify marker heat intolerance . To achieve goal , plan design cellular ( lymphocyte ) HTT experimental model detect gene expression profile use customized DNA microarrays bioinformatic tool ( gene select base previous DNA microarray study ) . Lymphocyte sample collect HT HI individual resting/comfort condition examine . Treatments analysis design reveal HI-associated gene-expression profile ( constitutive inducible ) , thereby find lymphocyte marker identify individual predispose heat injury . The identification subject could prevent unnecessary loss life . Notably , rapidly change climate era increase number occupation/age group manifestation HI appear .</brief_summary>
