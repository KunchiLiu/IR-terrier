	<brief_summary>This phase II multi-center study determine clinical impact use patient-specific genomic expression signature androgen receptor ( AR ) activity determine therapy patient castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . After patient eligibility determine , genomic signature apply fresh frozen tissue harvest metastatic lesion image-guided biopsy . After assess androgen receptor activity , investigator select patient either continued androgen manipulation nilutamide ( high AR activity ) target therapy dasatinib ( low AR activity ) . Once patient develop first progression either arm , patient receive combination therapy dasatinib nilutamide . The primary aim estimate median progression free survival men CRPC treat accord tumor AR activity . The investigator hypothesize treat men base upon AR activity , median progression free survival ( PFS ) improve historical median 3.0 month 6.0 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genomic Guided Therapy With Dasatinib Nilutamide Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer commonly diagnose non-cutaneous malignancy men United States remain second lead cause cancer-related mortality among men . Novel approach necessary personalize improve treatment . The androgen receptor ( AR ) play critical role normal development function prostate promote growth prostate cancer . Most patient advanced prostate cancer cancer initially respond androgen-targeting therapy ( focus decrease circulating level testosterone primary source ligand AR receptor ) . However , castrate resistance usually develop within 18 24 month median survival men castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) range 12 18 month . Current option limit include : secondary hormonal manipulation , radiopharmaceutical , chemotherapy docetaxel , taxane target microtubule , proven prolong survival . Importantly , become clear patient CRPC , prostate tumor remain dependent AR activity . This supported study demonstrate different genetic metabolic mechanism prostate cancer cell maintain AR activity despite low level circulate androgen . An assay detecting AR activity comprehensively reflect variety mechanism AR activity preserve potential accurately differentiate men tumor still dependent AR activity truly independent AR activity . The identification patient continue AR activity potential improve response secondary hormonal manipulation ; men tumor low level AR activity likely require alternative approach . We develop transcriptional `` signature '' AR activity goal identify true status AR tumor men CRPC . After validate AR signature vitro human prostate sample ensure accurately reproducibly detects AR activity , apply AR signature several independent datasets determine distribution CRPC tumor preserve AR activity . Interestingly , consistent heterogeneity respect predict AR activity . While overall AR activity decrease CRPC , subgroup patient persistently elevate AR activity . In tumor low AR activity , observe probability AR activity negatively correlate predicted SRC activity localize prostate cancer CRPC . Patients persistently high AR activity treat nilutamide , approve oral agent use metastatic CRPC target AR . Patients tumor low AR activity treat dasatinib ( oral drug know target SRC family kinase ) . As compel pre-clinical evidence interaction SRC pathway AR signal , patient fail either single agent treatment treat combination nilutamide dasatinib follow progression .</detailed_description>
