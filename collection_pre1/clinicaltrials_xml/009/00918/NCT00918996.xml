	<brief_title>The Bladder Flap Cesarean Section : A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Cesarean section common major surgical procedure woman world wide . In United States almost 25 % delivery cesarean section rate continue rise [ 1 ] . In perform procedure , imperative evidence base technique utilized optimize outcome minimize complication . Recently , case make simplify procedure eliminate unnecessary potentially harmful step [ 2 ] . Rationale Bladder Flap Challenged : While creation bladder flap long integral part standard cesarean section , evidence benefit . Creation bladder flap cesarean section date back pre-antibiotic era 19th century . One rationale enable surgeon gain access low uterine segment minimize injury bladder [ 3 ] . While old case report suggest inadequate bladder flap reflection risk factor bladder injury , collaborate [ 4 ] . On contrary , several study identify difficulty encounter develop bladder flap risk factor bladder injury cesarean section [ 5 , 6 ] . Although uncommon , creation bladder flap may also associate complication bladder flap hematoma dysuria , sometimes require re-operation drain collection release bladder flap [ 7-11 ] . It also suggest disruption autonomic innervation creation bladder flap result increase incidence urinary retention . In long term , creation bladder flap may result thick adhesion low uterine segment may lead difficult subsequent cesarean delivery bladder perforation [ 3 ] . Another rationale creation subsequent closure bladder flap protect peritoneal cavity intrauterine infection . With use antibiotic , closure bladder flap demonstrate unnecessary associate increased morbidity include febrile morbidity , adhesion upward dislocation urinary bladder [ 12 , 13 ] . This evidence result abandonment closure bladder flap cesarean section . Yet creation remain part standard practice . Limited Data Role Bladder Flap : Data role bladder flap cesarean section limit . A simplified method cesarean section ( Pelosi-type ) involve omission bladder among modification show safe cost save [ 2 ] . Only one publish study evaluate omission bladder flap modification [ 14 ] . This single randomize trial compare omission bladder flap 53 patient standard technique cesarean section 49 patient . The result show significant short term benefit omit bladder flap include reduction operating time , blood loss , postoperative pain microhematuria . The value European study limit exclusion repeat cesarean section , lack medium long-term outcome measure adhesion well homogeneity study population . It also argue time save omit bladder flap ( average 5 minute ) clinically significant [ 15 ] . On hand , 5 minute save 1 million cesarean section perform annually United States result 1 million minute ( 16667 hour , 694 day ) operate room time save . Of note , study design evaluate effect omit bladder flap major bladder injury . As author rightly argue , low incidence major bladder injury cesarean section ( 0.14-0.31 % ) mean large sample size ( &gt; 40,000 ) would require demonstrate difference [ 5 , 16 ] . Such study may never do . The study also limit primary cesarean section . The absence data omission bladder flap repeat cesarean section particularly noteworthy . It case adhesion low uterine segment make creation bladder flap difficult time consuming , potential complication . The report effect omit bladder flap cesarean section West African case series 142 patient [ 17 ] . That data little value , give absence comparison group unique study set . Evidence need Practice : From , appear wide spread use bladder flap cesarean section base anecdotal evidence clinical impression scientific evidence [ 3 ] . At present , remain establish advantage dissect bladder low uterine segment cesarean section . The paucity evidence commonly utilized technique cesarean section call well design randomize trial provide much need evidence inform clinic practice . With increase number cesarean delivery , eliminate unnecessary potentially harmful step reduce morbidity , improve outcome save cost . RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The goal study employ well design randomize control clinical trial evaluate effect omit bladder flap creation cesarean section . We hypothesize omission bladder flap primary repeat cesarean section associate short operating time without significant increase intraoperative postoperative complication . Specifically , propose : Aim 1 : To evaluate short term effect omit bladder flap include duration surgery , blood loss , hematuria immediate postoperative pain ; Aim 2 : To evaluate medium term effect omit bladder flap persistent hematuria , dysuria , ongoing requirement pain control Aim 3 : To evaluate long term effect omit bladder flap include adhesion duration subsequent cesarean section . STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Study Design : This randomize controlled trial comparing effect omission bladder flap standard cesarean section technique . Enrolled patient stratify primary repeat cesarean section randomize computer base program 'bladder flap ' 'no bladder flap ' group . Recruitment : All eligible patient schedule cesarean section Barnes Jewish Center Advanced Medicine OB/GYN clinic approach consent participate study . Patients give study information consent form review home . For unscheduled patient , consent seek decision make perform cesarean section . This limited non-emergent indication , consent obtain without interfere patient care . Procedures : Before enter operating room , surgeon open seal envelope contain randomization number patient 's allocation . The technique cesarean section similar group , except omission creation bladder flap . In 'no bladder flap ' group , low-transverse uterine incision perform 1cm vesicouterine peritoneal fold , without dissection formation bladder flap [ 14 ] . Patients undergo procedure base allocation unless intraoperative finding determine surgeon make alternative procedure medically indicate . Demographic ( e.g . age , race , socioeconomic status ) , obstetric ( e.g . parity , gestational age , indication cesarean section , cervical dilation time cesarean section , presence chorioamnionitis , surgical complication ) neonatal ( e.g . birth weight , Apgar score , cord pH ) data abstract patient chart . Follow Study : We plan follow study aim evaluate long term effect omit bladder flap . All enrol patient subsequently undergo repeat cesarean section facility within 5 year assessed duration subsequent surgery amount intraperitoneal adhesion . A previously publish adhesion score system include location degree adhesion use [ 18 ] . The surgeon repeat cesarean section blind initial allocation patient . Data Analysis : Analysis primary outcome analysis perform separately within primary repeat cesarean section group well combine study population . Analyses base intent treat . Surgical time secondary outcome blood loss compare across group use unpaired t-tests . However , blood loss identify skewed variable , possible use Wilcoxon 's test alternatively , use t-test follow log transformation data . If significant variation note individual surgeon ' operating time , analysis adjust use surgeon 's operating time index , define operating time / mean surgeon 's operating time . These analysis supplement multiple regression analyse adjust covariates include age mother , gestational age , indication cesarean section , cervical dilation time surgery identify potential confounding variable . Secondary outcome hematuria whether pain medication still require 2-4 week analyze use chi square test , logistic regression employ assess significance adjust relevant covariates list . A final set linear logistic regression analysis include primary repeat cesarean section evaluate interaction use bladder flap whether surgery type primary repeat see impact bladder flap different one subgroup compare . Analyses perform use Stata version 10 ( Stata Corp. , College Station , TX ) . Sample size consideration : Since goal study evaluate impact bladder flap separately primary repeat cesarean section patient , provide separate power computation two group . Based mean duration 45 minute ( SD 10minutes ) primary cesarean anticipate save 5 minute omit bladder flap , target sample size 64 primary cesarean section per group , yield statistical power 0.8 two-sided test 0.05 level significance . For repeat cesarean section anticipate large time save due impact scar tissue . However , conservative , assume 5 minute time save group well . We incorporate interim efficacy analysis group , use Obrien-Fleming stopping rule adjust type I error , base power computation nominal p-value 0.047 . With nominal pvalue , sample size requirement 65 per group power 0.8 detect 5-minute operative time difference two-sided test 0.05 level significance . Thus , total 258 patient recruit ( 64 x 2 + 65 x 2 ) .</detailed_description>
