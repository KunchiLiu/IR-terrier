This randomize , prospective trial evaluate cellular phone deliver counsel intervention versus standard care smoke cessation . In sub-study , evaluate rate progression atherosclerosis HIV/AIDS patient quit smoke versus continue smoke measure carotid intima-media thickness ( CIMT ) biomarkers atherosclerosis time point baseline , 1 year , 3 year . The biomarkers measure include high-sensitivity Creactive protein , homocysteine , IL-6 . We also evaluate rate progression CIMT quit smoke versus continue smoking , base race , sex , state HIV disease , comorbid disease , lipid profile .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV/AIDS patient may increase risk myocardial infarction . Traditional risk factor coronary artery disease , include cigarette smoking , likely play large role . The prevalence smoking HIV patient population high general population . We conduct sub-study `` An Innovative Telephone Intervention HIV+ Smokers , '' ( NCT00502827 ) conduct Drs . Gritz , Vidrine , others . This randomized prospective trial evaluate cellular phone deliver counsel intervention versus standard care smoke cessation . In sub-study , evaluate rate progression atherosclerosis HIV/AIDS patient quit smoke versus continue smoke measure carotid intima-media thickness ( CIMT ) biomarkers atherosclerosis time point baseline , 1 year , 3 year . The biomarkers measure include high-sensitivity Creactive protein , homocysteine , IL-6 . We also evaluate rate progression CIMT quit smoke versus continue smoke base race , sex , state HIV disease , comorbid disease lipid profile . The central hypothesis smoking cessation win slow atherosclerosis progression HIV patient . A successful behavioral intervention evaluate parent study . The goal sub-study assess effect modifiable coronary artery disease risk factor , smoking , HIV/AIDS patient collaboration cardiovascular expertise metric .</detailed_description>
