	<brief_summary>Summary : Vaginal prolapse well-known disease observe approximately 11 % postmenopausal woman tend increase age . Consequently , many surgical procedure develop order ensure sufficient support bladder , rectum vaginal vault depend site defect . However , many procedure associate high recurrence rate 40 % even within one two year surgical procedure . Due high recurrence rate new method include use mesh , either biologically synthetic . The latter permanent implant therefore theoretically may result long-lasting anatomically correct position prolapse . Although recurrence rate may lower use mesh surgical procedure may associate adverse event erosion vaginal mucosa . Others observe shrinkage vaginal mucosa . However , study large prolene mesh use . In contrast recurrence rate lower 25 % . The above-mentioned advantage synthetic mesh however , mostly base non-randomised study . The investigator therefore find importance evaluate whether surgical procedure use mesh implant superior conventional surgical technique . The present study clinical control study patient anterior vaginal prolapse randomise either mesh technique standard anterior procedure . The present study include two visit outpatient clinic surgical procedure . Furthermore patient fulfil questionnaire regard urinary faecal leakage sexual habit . Any participation study totally voluntary patient may time withdraw . In case patient receive investigator ' standard treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Avaulta Anterior Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RESEARCH PROTOCOL : The use Avaulta anterior repair . A multicenter randomise prospective control study . BACKGROUND : During resent year method pelvic organ prolapse repair change rapidly . The reason several . Firstly , relative high recurrence rate patient anterior vaginal repair . Thus , rate estimate close 40 % even higher often recurrences occurs within first two year . Weber et al Sand et al report various technique anterior colporrhaphy without use mesh successful management cystoceles 42 57 % , respectively . In contrast others show much low 1-year recurrence rate . Shull report safety efficacy paravaginal repair procedure may also vary success 67 - 100 % . Taken together however , interpretation study difficult since patient include undergone least one ( case several ) vaginal surgical procedure time study even include patient recurrence together patient schedule primary vaginal surgery . Secondly , need simple procedure , perform outpatient clinic thirdly , surgery acceptable woman , i.e . without postoperative pain , short recovery period need surgical intervention . In center vaginal surgical repair anterior genital prolapse perform standard manner midline incision follow dissection vaginal mucosa pubocervical fascia . Interrupted suture approximate fascia midline repair cystocele . However , may sufficient case fascia present presence huge defect pubocervical fascia . As consequence use mesh popular . Several study report reduce recurrence rate follow anterior repair use different type mesh biomesh ( 6,7 ) nonabsorbable mesh . The latter show associated vaginal erosion 8 - 2 % % , probably relate strong inflammatory response observe implementation mesh . Another complication shrinkage vaginal mucosa may follow sexual dysfunction dyspareunia . Polypropylene mesh appear induce less inflammatory respons compare type . A specific type mesh Avaulta Biosynthetic Mesh , polypropylene mesh coat collagen . This layer protect inflammatory response slowly resolve . Since study include patient undergo several vaginal surgical procedure time , difficult conclude whether use mesh superior compare conventional technique . Furthermore , sparse information available regard sexual function dyspareunia follow vaginal prolapse surgery . Especially lack information regard new mesh type . The purpose present study therefore test hypothesis Avaulta Biosynthetic Mesh associate low recurrence rate two year follow-up compare conventional anterior repair . Secondly , study plan evaluate frequency sexual dysfunction follow vaginal anterior repair , difference two surgical method .</detailed_description>
