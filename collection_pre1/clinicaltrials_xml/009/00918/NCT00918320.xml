	<brief_title>Studies Temozolomide Combination With Topotecan Refractory Relapsed Paediatric Solid Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment malignant paediatric solid tumor involve combination chemotherapy , surgery , certain case , radiotherapy . This multidisciplinary approach lead overall cure approximately 70 % . Nevertheless , cancer mortality remain leading cause disease-related death child adolescents 1 19 year . This due diseases poor prognosis , metastatic neuroblastoma , sarcoma soft tissue bone brain tumor . New effective treatment must find order continue increase cure rate child adolescent treat cancer , well improve cure patient ' quality life Neuroblastoma ( NB ) malignant paediatric tumour derive primordial neural crest cell . This tumor account 8 % 10 % cancer median age onset 22 month . The primary tumor may locate different anatomic site abdomen ( 65 % ) , thorax ( 19 % ) , pelvis ( 2 % ) , cervix ( 1 % ) . The strong prognostic factor age stage . Localized NB occur infant 90 % survival rate biological profile favorable . Conversely , case Myc-N amplification , survival around 30 % conventional treatment 70 % intensification . More 50 % patient disseminated tumor diagnosis , Stage 4 neuroblastoma patient older 1 year age represent frequent form . Neuroblastoma chemosensitive tumor . Chemotherapy indicate large primary tumour reduce volume attempt safe surgical resection eradicate tumour metastasis disseminate NB . The frequently use drug alkylating platinum agent ( cyclophosphamide , melphalan , cisplatin , carboplatin ) , topoisomerase II inhibitor ( doxorubicin , etoposide ) vinca-alkaloids ( vincristine ) . High-dose chemotherapy ( busulfan , melphalan , carboplatin , etoposide ) autologous bone marrow stem cell support use consolidation treatment patient metastatic disease , well maintenance therapy retinoid acid . Although intensive strategy , probability survival patient 1 year age Stage 4 neuroblastoma less 40 % . New drug urgently need patient recurrent neuroblastoma . Central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor entity represent second frequent malignancy childhood adolescent . The incidence rate childhood primary benign malignant brain tumor 3.9 case per 100,000 person-years , appear increase . Two third new case child le 15 year age . The morbidity associate CNS tumor exceed malignancy undoubtedly result neurological cognitive deficit associate tumor aggressive multimodal therapy . Current treatment involve surgical resection , mostly combine irradiation and/or chemotherapy . This multidisciplinary approach lead cure 55 % brain tumour patient . However , outcome small child certain malignancy , high grade astrocytomas , brain stem glioma atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor metastatic primary neuroectodermal tumor ( PNET ) /medulloblastoma still dismal . In addition , treatment irradiation and/or combination different chemotherapeutic agent limit tolerance induce renal , hepatic , auditory , hematological toxicity . Moreover , irradiation cerebral hemisphere , especially small child , induces devastate sequela . Clinical resistance anticancer agent primary reason treatment failure childhood cancer development new agent new profile anti-tumour activity toxicity highly warrant . Other relapsed/refractory non-CNS solid tumor include nephroblastoma , osteosarcoma , Ewing 's sarcoma , rhabdomyosarcoma soft-tissue sarcoma , rarer tumour , hepatoblastoma , retinoblastoma , nasopharyngeal carcinoma , germ-cell tumour . For tumor , treatment protocol available first-line therapy ; lesser extent , treatment recommendation propose case relapse . Depending disease , type , localization relapse , treatment may include combination salvage chemotherapy , include high-dose chemotherapy stem cell rescue , radiotherapy , surgery . In several disease , temozolomide ( well topoisomerase I inhibitor , irinotecan Topotecan ) show single agent activity may use combination schedule .</detailed_description>
