	<brief_summary>Rationale : High-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , consistently increase moderate alcohol consumption , abundant plasma lipoprotein generally think anti-inflammatory health infectious disease . HDL bind neutralizes bioactivity potent bacterial remnant lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) stimulate host innate immune response . Primary objective : To explore whether prolonged moderate alcohol consumption affect vivo cytokine response low dose LPS young , normal-weight men .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cytokine response human model low-grade systemic inflammation Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) endotoxin constituent Gram-negative bacterial cell wall . It circulate plasma healthy human subject low concentration ( 1 200 pg/mL ) . Furthermore , human gut host ~100 trillion organism , together contribute enteric reservoir ~1 g LPS ( 4 ) . Upon introduction bloodstream endotoxin bind LPS-binding protein ( LBP ) complex bind CD14 monocyte . CD14 intracellular domain signal Toll-like receptor 4 , lead eventually activation transcription factor NF-κB production Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha ( TNF-α , ) interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) systemic inflammatory response . Endotoxin administration human , give low dose , well-established model systemic inflammation ( 5 ) . The low dose endotoxin elicit acute mild systemic inflammation significant reproducible cytokine leucocyte response without increase body temperature ( 2 ; 3 ) . This model thus resemble level report chronic low-grade inflammatory condition type 2 diabetes arthrosclerosis . High-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) group lipoprotein particle high density circulation . HDL several anti-atherogenic effect , include ability transport excess cellular cholesterol liver excretion , protect low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) oxidation inhibit platelet aggregation . Besides pivotal role protect atherosclerosis , accumulate evidence also suggest HDL possess anti-inflammatory effect play important role modulate inflammatory response lipopolysaccharides . Although lipoprotein class demonstrate bind LPS , add whole human normal blood , mainly bind HDL ( 60 % ) , addition LDL ( 25 % ) VLDL ( 12 % ) ( 6 ) . In vitro , LPS bind lipoprotein 20- 1000-fold less active unbound form induce monocyte macrophage release cytokine ( 7 ) . When transgenic mouse 2-fold elevation plasma HDL level inject LPS , LPS bound HDL , low plasma cytokine level , improve survival rate compare control mouse ( 8 ) . In human Ex vivo reconstitute HDL abolish LPS-induced overproduction cytokine patient severe cirrhosis control ( 9 ) intravenous infusion reconstitute HDL protect human toxic effect LPS ( 10 ) . It never study whether alcohol-induced increase HDL could attenuate effect LPS cytokine response ex vivo vivo . Given fact alcohol induces increase HDL ( 1 ) HDL LPS-neutralizing property , hypothesize moderate alcohol consumption attenuate LPS-induced cytokine response TNF-α IL-6 young , normal-weight men . In addition , HDL cause regulation CD14 expression monocyte ( 10 ) CD14 modulate pro-inflammatory response LPS ( 11 ) , effect HDL CD14 expression expression gene relate inflammation determine monocyte time vivo ex vivo LPS administration . Since HDL also affect endothelial function ( 12 ; 13 ) since eicosanoids important messenger systemic inflammatory process ( 14 ) marker also investigate .</detailed_description>
