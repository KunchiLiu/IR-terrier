	<brief_title>Obatoclax Systemic Mastocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Obatoclax mesylate design block growth malignant mast cell . This may cause cancer cell die . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive obatoclax mesylate peripheral intravenous catheter ( needle vein arm ) . The drug give 3 hour day Days 1-3 14-day study cycle . If study doctor think need , might receive study drug though silicone-based central venous catheter ( CVC ) . A central venous catheter sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Some catheter use study drug . If already one catheter body , may need replace begin receive study drug . You sign separate consent describe procedure risk detail . Study Visits : One ( 1 ) time study cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You ask side effect may drug may take . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Every 3 month take study drug , bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . Length Study : You able continue receive study drug long benefitting . You take study intolerable side effect disease get bad . Follow-Up : Three month last dose study drug , doctor call ask feeling . This call take 10 minute . Additional Information : - You must tell doctor drug allergy may . - You must tell doctor much alcohol consume drug may take , include vitamin , herbal remedy , over-the-counter , prescription , and/or illegal drug . Some interact study drug . - You must arrange someone drive home treatment .
