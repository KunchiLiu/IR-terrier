	<brief_title>Laser Spectroscopy Breast Tissue Through Needle Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To prove optical spectrum collect insert optical fiber probe breast tissue biopsy needle adequate quality render spectroscopic diagnosis . OUTLINE : Optical spectrum acquire ex vivo sample normal malignant breast tissue use diffuse reflectance , fluorescence , Raman spectroscopy . Tissue spectrum measure use portable clinical spectroscopy device front- side-viewing optical fiber probe insert breast tissue hollow biopsy needle . After probes withdrawn needle , cut biopsy obtain tissue mark site spectral measurement . The biopsy specimens fix formalin submit histopathologic study use standard light microscopy technique ( i.e. , H &amp; E stain IHC ) . Additional histochemical , immunohistochemical , fluorescent situ stain may perform support diagnosis well understand spectroscopy result . Medical record review obtain information pathology report patient demographic , pathological characteristic surgical specimen , clinical indication surgical procedure .</detailed_description>
