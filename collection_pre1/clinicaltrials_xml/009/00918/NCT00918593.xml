	<brief_summary>By apply short electric pulse cell , cell membrane become permeabilised ( electroporation ) . This used augment effect chemotherapy , provide direct access cell cytosol . For drug bleomycin , enhancement effect several hundred fold , enable once-only treatment . The investigator wish compare electrochemotherapy radiotherapy treat ulcerated cutaneous metastasis 5 cm diameter kind histology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palliative Treatment Ulcerated Cutaneous Metastases : Trial Between Electrochemotherapy Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 5 % cancer patient experience cutaneous metastasis . Ulcerating metastasis great psychological distress patient may also painful . Radiation therapy standard treatment ulcerating metastasis , report response rate . With study wish compare electrochemotherapy radiotherapy treat ulcerated cutaneous metastasis 5 cm diameter kind histology . Patient recruitment : 98 patient recruit , patient randomize electrochemothreapy radiotherapy . 49 patient treated arm . Treatment : Patients treat local general anesthesia ( inhale max . 30 % oxygen ) Bleomycin give either intratumoral intravenous . Electric pulse administer use square wave electroporator ( IGEA , Carpi , Italy ) . Needle plate electrode use order treat affect area efficiently . Eight pulse frequency 5000 Hz 1 Hz use application electrode . In way , large area treat within short time . Post treatment , area cover dry dressing , standardly use . The patient see 8 , 30 , 60 , 90 180 day post treatment . Chest X ray take treatment patient receive electrochemotherapy . Evaluation : Evaluation perform measurement lesion extension digital photography use RECIST criterion . The first 10 patient treatment arm also PET/CT-scanned one week treatment . Safety : Safety report term evaluation adverse event term patient satisfaction determine questionnaire , include 'Derriford Appearance Questionaire ' .</detailed_description>
