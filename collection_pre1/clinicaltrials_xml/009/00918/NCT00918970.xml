	<brief_summary>Context : A major lack organ donor serious public health problem . It determine prolonged delay transplant perform thus significant number death patient wait transplantation . The aim project reduce delay diagnosis brain death , also improve diagnosis Intensive Care Unit . The diagnosis brain death strictly define law relies either two consecutive flat electroencephalogram record interval four hour , lack cerebral circulation brain angiography perform suspect brain death clinical exam . However , usual practice , difficult need clinical argument , interpretation difficult pathological context . This may participate delay lack patient potentially donor . Pre-study : In pilot study , fifty subject severe cerebral lesion , continuous ECG recording . The investigator could find decrease autonomic nervous system activity , measure ECG , correlate transition brain death assess cerebral angiography . The loss cardiac variability always observe two cerebral angiography , one second brain death . This study allow investigator calculate threshold value sympathetic parasympathetic activity confirm brain death .</brief_summary>
