	<brief_summary>The primary objective study define effect Tysabri patient relapsing-remitting ( RR ) multiple sclerosis ( MS ) 2 year . The investigator also explore extent remyelination MS patient treat Tysabri 2 year . A secondary objective study investigate difference capacity remyelination patient respond Tysabri monotherapy 24 month . A tertiary objective study monitor Tysabri effect MS antiphospholipid antibody positive MS antiphospholipid antibody negative patient determine perfusion difference accord antiphospholipid antibody positivity status .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Tysabri Patients With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis : A Follow-up Magnetization Transfer Imaging ( MTI ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetization transfer imaging ( MTI ) widely use tool characterize evolution multiple sclerosis ( MS ) lesion normal appear brain tissue ( NABT ) . As remyelination demyelination heterogeneous lesion NABT , techniques voxel-wise base MTR dynamic mapping may help predict individual 's clinical course , well effect treatment , reveal evidence myelin repair neuroprotection . Natalizumab ( Tysabri ) show robust effect decrease inflammation phase II III clinical trial , evidence decrease Gd enhance T2 lesion decrease clinical activity measure reduction clinical relapse progression disability . The effect Tysabri non-conventional measure partially know .</detailed_description>
