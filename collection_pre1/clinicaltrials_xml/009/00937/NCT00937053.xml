	<brief_title>Maintaining Higher Level Haemoglobin : Effect White Cells After Bone Marrow Transplantation Children .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator know child require bone marrow transplant need first go myeloablative regimen , induces neutropenia . The length neutropenia incidence risk contract bacterial fungal infection could lethal . It important find way accelerate neutrophil recovery , patient survival improve . Studies conduct '70s '80s suggest hemoglobin level could keep high level , neutrophil recovery would accelerate . Other study also support hypothesis stem cell need produce red cell supply transfusion , stem cell would differentiate non-erythroid cell line . As , patient undergo bone marrow transplant , standard practice transfuse red cell base condition patient hemoglobin level fall 70 g/L . Hematopoietic growth factor use increase speed neutrophil recovery , study conduct far demonstrate mortality length hospitalization reduce specific use G-CSF . In recent study , agent show also negative effect , delay platelet recovery impair immune recovery . In addition , prophylactic use G-CSF also associate graft-versus-host disease , treatment-related mortality death . In conclusion , study determine maintain high hemoglobin level effect neutrophil recovery allogenic bone marrow transplantation child .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients 1 year age 18 year age time transplantation ( 18 year upper limit childhood CIBMTR definition ) 2 . Patients plan undergo relate unrelated allogeneic bone marrow transplant malignant benign disease ( except sickle cell disease ) 3 . Conditioning regimen must myeloablative , i.e . include busulfan great equal 12 mg/kg Total Body Irradiation great equal 10 Gy , except patient acquire severe aplastic anemia 4 . Absence psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule ; condition discuss patient enrolment trial 5 . Patient must agree receive blood transfusion 6 . Patient ( legal guardian ) must sign Informed consent Form 1 . Patients receive autologous bone marrow transplant , cord blood transplant peripheral stem cell transplant 2 . Sickle cell disease ( since high hemoglobin level increase blood viscosity put patient risk stroke ) 3 . Hematopoietic growth factor ( GCSF , GMCSF , stem cell factor , erythropoietin ) plan transplantation ( posttransplant decision hematopoietic growth factor administration require patient 's condition accept ) 4 . Presence alloantibody direct red blood cell</criteria>
