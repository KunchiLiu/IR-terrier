	<detailed_description>The management significant duodenal injury combine duodenal-pancreatic injury continue challenge controversial . Several technique advocate year prevent dreaded complication repair breakdown , fistulization , intra-abdominal sepsis . These include duodenal diverticulization , triple tube ostomy , tube duodenostomy , pyloric exclusion . These technique design decompress , heal without undue intraluminal pressure flow . Recently , surgeon question whether aggressive adjunctive diversion truly necessary , especially less severe injury , many note complication associate reconstruction apart injury . An alternative routine diversion/decompression/exclusion damage control/planned reoperation strategy follow laparotomy severe visceral injury become prevalent past two decade . Instead perform primary duodenal repair enteral diversion decompression single operation , many surgeon employ surveillance `` touch-up '' strategy course 2-4 abdominal exploration . The abdominal fascia close heal phase commence surgeon feel confident repair hold . At trauma center , advent damage control plan re-operation strategy result evolution management duodenal laceration combine duodenal-pancreatic injury . The investigator perform noticeably few decompression , diversion , exclusion procedure increasingly rely serial abdominal exploration surveillance repair . In retrospective review , intend quantify change practice report outcome compare previous practice . Using OHSU Trauma Laparotomy Outcomes Database , identify patient receive trauma laparotomy duodenal combine duodenal-pancreatic injury identify 20-year period 1989-2009 . The medical record patient review confirm duodenal injury tabulate factor . The patient categorize base management duodenal injury , e.g . primary repair , decompression , diversion , exclusion . Patients also categorize accord laparotomy strategy , e.g . damage control , plan reoperation , primary fascial closure without plan reoperation . Duodenal-related complication tabulate various group compare . The investigator anticipate include 50 patient .</detailed_description>
