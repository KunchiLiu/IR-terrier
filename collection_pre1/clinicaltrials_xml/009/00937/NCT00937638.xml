	<brief_summary>The propose research provide important information role 2 intervention diet provide different amount lean beef meet current nutrient recommendation treatment Metabolic Syndrome ( MetSyn ) , chronic disease still increase prevalence alarm rate . The experimental diet design enable u evaluate lifestyle intervention MetSyn person maintain weight , lose weight maintain weight loss , currently recommend clinical practice . Importantly , investigator compare diet high lean beef ( 5 oz/day ) compositionally similar ( i.e. , energy nutrient ) modified-DASH diet , low beef diet become Gold Standard management cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor , include MetSyn . In addition , investigator also evaluate moderate-high protein diet ( BOLD+ ) high total protein ( mixed source include lean beef , 7oz/day ) BOLD diet , CVD risk factor person MetSyn . A follow-up study conduct assess dietary compliance sub-sample population 12-months ; participant inform end-point additional consent obtain . Hypotheses : 1 . Healthful isocaloric diet include lean beef primary source protein ( BOLD diet ) average ( 18 % ; BOLD ) moderate-high ( 28 % ; BOLD+ ) total protein intake show similar great reduction CVD risk , respectively compare modified-DASH diet . 2 . A healthful weight-loss diet , include lean beef primary source protein high-moderate protein diet ( BOLD+ diet ) , plus regular exercise ( BOLD+ + ex ) reduce body weight equal BOLD + ex DASH + ex intervention , may improve CV risk factor ( BP TG ) , therefore reduce prevalence MetSyn BOLD + ex DASH + ex intervention . 3 . The BOLD diet effective modified-DASH diet , BOLD+ diet effective BOLD diet maintain CVD benefit attain phase 1 2 . Dietary adherence well BOLD BOLD + diet compare modified DASH diet .</brief_summary>
