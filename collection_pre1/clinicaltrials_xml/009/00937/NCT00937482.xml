	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose cediranib maleate give together whole brain radiation therapy treat patient brain metastases non-small cell lung cancer . Cediranib maleate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray type radiation kill cancer cell shrink tumor . Giving cediranib maleate together radiation therapy may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate Whole Brain Radiation Therapy Patients With Brain Metastases From Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability ( maximum tolerate dose , MTD ) AZD2171 combine WBRT patient brain metastasis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe objective response rate ( ORR ) central nervous system ( CNS ) , neurologic progression-free survival ( N-PFS ) , overall survival , cause death , explore vascular normalization window use serial , noninvasive imaging parameter . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral cediranib maleate day 1 . Patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy 5 day week 3 week begin day 3 . Treatment continue treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
