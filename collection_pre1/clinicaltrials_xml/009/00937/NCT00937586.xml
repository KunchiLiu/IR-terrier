	<detailed_description>DNA isolate person study presence certain gene may increase chance develop prostate cancer . Certain gene also study patient know prostate cancer determine increase chance cancer spread part body decrease one 's chance cure . Small difference gene slightly affect ability function . While difference normal , may influence way cancer respond therapy . An understanding gene increase ( decrease ) chance cure disease , prostate cancer , improve ability take care patient effectively . A second purpose study collect blood cancer tissue future study . While small difference gene may best marker bad cancer , also possible protein blood tumor may better marker .</detailed_description>
