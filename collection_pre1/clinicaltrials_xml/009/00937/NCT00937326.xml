	<brief_title>Clinical Study Assess Safety Pharmacokinetics SRT2104 Type 2 Diabetic Human Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives Primary : 1 . To determine safety tolerability SRT2104 ( 0.25 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 g/day ) type 2 diabetic subject administer daily 28 consecutive day . 2 . To characterize pharmacokinetic profile SRT2104 ( 0.25 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 g/day ) single dose multiple administration type 2 diabetic subject . Secondary : 1 . To determine effect SRT2104 ( 0.25 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 g/day ) administer daily 28 consecutive day fast blood glucose insulin post-prandial blood glucose insulin type 2 diabetic subject . Study Design : Prospective , multi-center , clinical study SRT2104 administer orally daily 28 consecutive day ; randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , multiple-dose , inpatient/outpatient study ass safety pharmacokinetics ( PK ) SRT2104 type 2 diabetic male female subject exist , stable , background metformin therapy . Approximately 225 subject age 30-70 , fulfill inclusion/exclusion criterion , enrol study ensure completion forty ( 40 ) evaluable subject within five dose group . Subjects evenly randomize receive SRT2104 one five dos , placebo ( A ) , 0.25 g/day ( B ) , 0.5 g/day ( C ) , 1.0 g/day ( D ) , 2.0 g/day ( E ) , day 28 consecutive day , approximately 15 minute follow consumption standardize meal . Subjects remain fixed dose test material dosing day study . Subjects sign inform consent form Screening Visit , undergo screen assessment 2-day period verify eligibility study . If eligible willing participate , subject return clinic within 21 day Screening Visit participate dose phase study . Subjects randomize receive SRT2104 placebo , require stay overnight study center Day -1 Day 27 gather require PK sample assess safety Day 1 Day 28 respectively . In addition , subject ask return study center Days 2 29 ; three interim weekly safety assessment ( Days 8 , 15 , 22 ) ; End Study safety assessment 7 day complete 28-day dosing period . A follow-up safety call make subject 30 day follow final dose SRT2104 placebo .</detailed_description>
