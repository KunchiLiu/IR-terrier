	<brief_title>Treatment Response Schizophrenia : Bridging Imaging Postmortem Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our past brain imaging Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) study contribute understand specific brain region related treatment response antipsychotic drug schizophrenia . We find treatment response antipsychotic medication relate blood-flow pattern specific region ( ventral striatum , anterior cingulate cortex , hippocampus ) . In addition , functional change region follow one week antipsychotic drug therapy predictive treatment response . Dr. Roberts , neuroanatomist , study post mortem ( death ) brain patient schizophrenia work association Maryland Brain Collection . Her study indicate increased number dopaminergic synapsis ( , neuron produce neurotransmitter dopamine ) region patient know favorable response antipsychotic drug therapy . In addition , post-mortem work know number glutamate synapsis region significantly different good treatment responder poor responder . From study hypothesize schizophrenia over-abundance dopamine ventral striatum interfere normal function limit transmission glutamate . Putatively , antipsychotic medication may decrease symptom schizophrenia restore glutamatergic activity ventral striatum project area , anterior cingulate cortex hippocampus . We hypothesize individual respond favorably antipsychotic drug therapy display great glutamate activity ventral striatum ( due dopamine blockade ) region receive glutamate projection . This lead restore neuronal functioning good responder compare treatment resistant poor responder antipsychotic drug treatment . We test hypothesis use complementary imaging postmortem study yield data permit formulation comprehensive model antipsychotic drug response subject severe mental illness . Magnetic Resonance technique probe atom molecule base upon interaction external magnetic field . Magnetic Resonance use ionize radiation . The familiar example Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) . Another application Magnetic Resonance call functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) . Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) allow u measure Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent ( BOLD ) response , measure blood flow brain know correlate neuronal activity . Another application Magnetic Resonance Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) , allow measurement specific metabolites N-acetyl aspartate ( NAA ) , measure neuronal integrity , Glutamate , involve neurotransmission metabolism . We seek replicate extend past Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) find functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) use cognitive task know activate hippocampus ( Episodic memory task ) anterior cingulate cortex ( Stroop task ) . This aim seek parse differential contribution hippocampus anterior cingulate cortex treatment response . At time , N-acetylaspartate , marker neuronal integrity , glutamate measurement obtain magnetic resonance spectroscopy anterior cingulate cortex hippocampus directly probe live brain relation neuronal integrity , glutamate function , treatment response . In parallel , postmortem work Dr. Roberts ( UAB IRB exemption : NO70813001 , IRB # F080306003 ) concentrate study anterior cingulate cortex post mortem brain schizophrenic patient . These study allow development hypothesis pathophysiology treatment response provide basis interpretation functional imaging data . The overarch goal identify image marker predict treatment response , confirm validate biomarkers use anatomical study postmortem tissue . Early detection drug response would yield specific treatment strategy tailor individual , thus improve quality life patient drastically reduce cost associate unsuccessful treatment strategy .</detailed_description>
