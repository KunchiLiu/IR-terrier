	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study side effect well give leuprolide acetate goserelin acetate work compare observation treat patient high-risk prostate cancer undergone radical prostatectomy . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , goserelin acetate leuprolide acetate , may lessen amount androgen make body thus control prostate cancer growth . Many time , surgery , tumor may need treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . However , prostate cancer chance tumor re-grow despite surgery base certain high risk feature .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Leuprolide Acetate Goserelin Acetate Compared With Observation Treating Patients With High-Risk Prostate Cancer Who Have Undergone Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare difference biochemical progression-free survival rate ( bPFS ) 2-years immediate androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) nine month high risk prostate cancer patient follow radical prostatectomy similar high risk patient population follow without initiation immediate ADT treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine difference bPFS , prostate cancer specific survival , overall survival immediate ADT nine month observation high risk prostate cancer patient follow radical prostatectomy . II . To evaluate toxicity profile quality life ( QOL ) measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Prostate ( FACT-P ) linear analogue self assessment ( LASA ) two treatment arm . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore serum urine biomarker ( ) level study entry , 9 month , 24 month two treatment arm correlate biochemical progression-free survival rate . II . To explore &gt; 5 circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) circulate endothelial cell ( CECs ) follow study treatment associated biochemical progression-free survival rate . III . To explore prognostic predictive value tissue base biomarkers high risk prostate cancer patient . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive leuprolide acetate intramuscularly ( IM ) day 1 OR goserelin acetate subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 month 9 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients undergo observation every 3 month 9 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow every three month 2 year .</detailed_description>
