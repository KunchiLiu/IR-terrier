	<brief_summary>Diacylglycerol ( DAG ) molecule consist two fatty acid chain bound ester link glycerol molecule , form 1,2 1,3 structural isomer . Approximately 10 % edible oil today 's market comprise DAG . DAG oil similar taste , appearance , fatty acid composition conventional triacylglycerol oil ( TAG ; consist 3 fatty acid chain bound glycerol molecule ) , yet recent study suggest due different chemical structure , DAG oil may induce cardiovascular ( CV ) benefit . Specifically , human study United States ( US ) Japan show long-term consumption diet contain DAG oil enhances loss body weight body fat compare TAG oil similar fatty acid composition . In postprandial study , serum triglyceride ( TG ) remnant like particle cholesterol concentration , show low follow ingestion DAG-enriched oil compare conventional dietary oil ( e.g. , soybean , corn ) , TAG oil . Therefore , DAG oil appear effective prevent postprandial hyperlipidemia , risk factor arteriosclerosis . The hypothesis investigator propose pilot study intake DAG oil , compare TAG oil result low LDL-C , low LDL-C/HDL-C ratio , well reduction TG level . Given significance finding , confirm , investigator evaluate important clinical biomarkers chronic disease ( CV Disease , type 2 diabetes , metabolic syndrome ) , insulin sensitivity inflammation [ determine C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-6 &amp; tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-Î± ) ] , also may beneficially affect consumption palm DAG oil . During pilot study , investigator reserve serum/plasma sample additional assay may run upon approval modification .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Commonly consume vegetable fat oil comprise predominantly TAG , small amount DAG monoacylglycerol . TAG consist 3 fatty acid ester , whereas diacylglycerol oil 2 fatty acid ester link glycerol backbone . Recently , Watanabe et al. , develop process ratio glyceride find plant oil soybean , canola ( rapeseed ) , corn shift TAG DAG , lead formation oil compose largely DAG . Commercially , DAG oil produce esterification fatty acid derive natural edible plant oil presence lipase enzyme . Commercially produce vegetable DAG oil contains &gt; 80 % DAG , &lt; 20 % TAG , &lt; 5 % monoacylglycerols , small amount emulsifier antioxidant maintain quality . The main constituent fatty acid DAG oil oleic ( C18:1 ) , linoleic ( C18:2 ) , linolenic ( C18:3 ) acid , present 1,3- 1,2 ( 2,3 ) -DAGs ratio 7:3 , respectively . These structural difference may responsible purport metabolic effect DAG compare TAG oil , DAG oil few fatty acid TAG , DAG-oil great proportion DAG sn-1,3 versus sn-1,2 form may readily oxidize . Thus , effect DAG oil increase LDL-C would expect less TAG oil .</detailed_description>
