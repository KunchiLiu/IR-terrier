	<brief_title>Postoperative Concurrent Chemoradiation Head Neck Cancer With Multiple Minor Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , postoperative chemoradiation recommend head neck squamous cell carcinoma poor prognostic feature , extracapsular spread metastatic lymph node , positive resection margin . Other patient may receive postoperative radiotherapy , risk factor . In previous study , 3 `` minor '' risk factor , 3-year recurrence rate 55 % . This outcome far inferior patient minor risk factor less 3 . Thus , believe current postoperative radiotherapy insufficient patient multiple minor risk . A clinical trial raise help patient . However , patient number group enough large scale , phase 3 trial . So arranged phase II trial postoperative chemoradiation test prospectively observe treatment outcome .</detailed_description>
