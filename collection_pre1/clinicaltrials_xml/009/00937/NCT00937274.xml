	<brief_title>Antibacterial Treatment Against Diarrhea Oral Rehydration Solution</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized double-blind , placebo control trial ( RCT ) aim evaluate effect oral administer E. coli phage child age 4-60 month age proven ETEC EPEC diarrhea . Children screen exclude V. cholerae infection dark field microscopy , rotavirus stool ELISA , invasive diarrhoea clinically well stool microscopy , identify child possible ETEC EPEC diarrhoea . Enrolled child randomly assign , equal number , receive either : ( ) new T4 phage cocktail ( ii ) Russian anti-E. coli phage cocktail ( Microgen ) dose recommend manufacturer ( iii ) oral rehydration solution ( placebo ) 5 day addition management dehydration continue feed accordance WHO guideline . Duration diarrhea , daily cumulative stool output , volume oral rehydration solution intake , stool frequency , time recovery weight gain main outcome measure . As dose phage intend use therapeutic trial high dose administer young child earlier safety trial , plan initially conduct safety study three study product 45 child non cholera , non rotavirus non invasive diarrhea , randomize equally three intervention group , final study mention . The outcome measure safety part include assessment laboratory parameter include renal liver function test , haematological index , microbiological efficacy phage measure phage E. coli titre daily stool sample . If high dose find safe , tolerable , associated significant adverse event , proceed clinical efficacy trial . We believe T4 coli phage assess effective overall diarrhea management , might lead development affordable sustainable adjunct currently available case management E. coli diarrhea , benefit million child worldwide .</detailed_description>
