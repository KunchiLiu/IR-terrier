	<brief_summary>ICU-acquired weakness represent common often devastating disease process affect great 50 % critically ill patient . This pathogenesis acquire disease multifactorial result variable severity , range mild , transient severe , permanent dysfunction peripheral nerve additional muscle . In affected patient , weakness may persist month year acute phase illness , implicate major contributor decrease functional status quality life . Muscle ultrasound validate assessment muscle size well diagnosis myopathic neuropathic change patient know neuromuscular disease . The use muscle ultrasound image modality diagnosis monitor ICU-acquired weakness study , although single study use muscle ultrasound show significant change muscle size ICU patient receive high dose corticosteroid prolong course paralytic agent . The investigator plan use multiple modality examine skeletal muscle catabolism , function , structure patient critical illness recovery . The investigator combine physical exam , hand grip dynamometry , electrophysiologic study , serum biomarkers , muscle biopsy , muscle ultrasound ass group critically ill patient hospital stay . The investigator obtain additional data , include neuropsychiatric assessment , severity illness score , administration potentially harmful medication , pertinent daily laboratory data . This study last approximately 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients include adult , patient medical and/or surgical ICU receive treatment follow : respiratory failure , cardiogenic septic shock . 1 . Cumulative ICU time &gt; 5 day past 30 day , include current ICU stay , might create state flux regard patient ' cognitive baseline . 2 . Severe cognitive neurodegenerative disease prevent patient living independently baseline , include mental illness require institutionalization , acquire congenital mental retardation , know brain lesion , traumatic brain injury , cerebrovascular accident resultant moderate severe cognitive deficit ADL dependency , Parkinson 's disease , Huntington 's disease , severe Alzheimer 's disease dementia etiology . 3 . ICU admission post cardiopulmonary resuscitation suspect anoxic injury . 4 . An active substance abuse psychotic disorder , recent ( within past 6 month ) serious suicidal gesture necessitate hospitalization . This exclusion enrich followup rate avoid patient particularly challenge maintain longterm contact . 5 . Blind , deaf , unable speak English , condition would preclude ability perform followup evaluation interview . 6 . Overly moribund expect survive additional 24 hour / withdraw life support focus comfort measure . 7 . Prisoners . 8 . Patients live 200 mile Nashville regularly visit Nashville area . 9 . Patients homeless secondary contact person available . This exclusion enrich followup rate avoid patient particularly challenge maintain longterm contact . 10 . The onset current episode respiratory failure , cardiogenic shock , septic shock &gt; 72 hour ago . 11 . Patients cardiac bypass surgery within past 3 month ( include current hospitalization ) . 12 . Patients know Neuromuscular disease prior admission . 13 . BMI &gt; 40 patient size make percutaneous muscle biopsy muscle ultrasound possible . 14 . Patients platelet count less 30,000 .</criteria>
