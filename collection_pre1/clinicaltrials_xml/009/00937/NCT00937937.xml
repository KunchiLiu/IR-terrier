	<brief_title>Dinaciclib Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess 1-year overall survival rate patient stage IV melanoma treat dinaciclib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess 6-month progression-free survival rate patient . II . To evaluate response rate ( confirm unconfirmed complete partial response ) subset patient measurable disease . III . To assess safety tolerability dinaciclib give patient stage IV melanoma . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive dinaciclib IV 2 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
