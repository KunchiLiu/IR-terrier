	<detailed_description>The Objective study introduce practically feasible multifaceted intervention preadmission clinic help reduce smoke preoperative surgical patient . We aim study effectiveness program promoting positive change smoke behavior among patient surgery . The forced abstinence enforce patient hospital stay surgery also use help smoker remain tobacco free long term . The intervention program study primarily base smoke cessation guideline endorse Department Family Community Medicine , University Toronto . The study research staff ( include research coordinator ) train accordance guideline read material provide also base guideline . The counseling skill coordinator review every 3 month ensure minimal variability . The coordinator also involve regular meeting address difficult situation scenario .

Interventions Preadmission : Demographic personal chrematistics patient include age , sex , average number cigarette smoke per day record . Patients receive questionnaire base Prochaska DiClemente 's Stages Change Model determine whether precontemplating , contemplate , prepare actively engage smoking cessation . In order baseline smoking status , urinary cotinine expired-air carbon monoxide ( COE ) measure patient preadmission clinic . All patient receive two 15 minute face face standard counseling session research coordinator . First counsel do preadmission . Counseling include provision advice quit smoke obtain information regard smoke behavior skill build supplement standard print material . The patient inform benefit even short term abstinence surgery . The target quit date ( TQD ) patient set 24 hour surgery surgical patient routinely require abstinent time surgery . The patient instructed initiate medication ( placebo ) exactly one week TQD . The whole treatment period 12 week include 1- week titration follow : Days 1 - 3 : 0.5 mg daily ( 1 table day ) Days 4 - 7 : 0.5 mg twice daily ( 1 morning 1 evening ) Days 8 - 12 week 1.0 mg twice daily ( 1 morning 1 evening ) Patients varenicline group prescribe varenicline 12 week . Patients placebo group prescribe placebo ( lactose , identical medication pill appearance ) period time . The patient preadmission clinic receive two bottle medication ( placebo ) : One contain 17 X 0.5 mg tab ( i.e . 11 tabs plus 6 extra tablet 3-day window period ) first week titration ; one contain 66 X 1.0 mg tab ( 28 day X 2 tablet = 56 tablet plus10 5-day window period ) next 4 week treatment . We call patient one week TQD remind start treatment . In case delay cancel surgery , TQD change patient continue treatment accord mention schedule . The patient ask return first medication bottle remain pill day surgery . There rare post-marketing report serious neuropsychiatric symptom varenicline , include depressed mood , agitation , hostility , change behavior , suicidal ideation suicide , well worsen pre-existing psychiatric illness ( previously diagnose ) . It know whether event occur rate severity different background rate smoking cessation general population , psychiatric population ( treat untreated ) , different rate drug class smoking cessation . All patient and/or family alert need monitor medication side effect include neuropsychiatric symptom . Since begin treatment in-hospital visit follow phone call , patient ask change behavior thought . Patients instructed stop take medication ( placebo ) contact healthcare provider research coordinator immediately family observe depressed mood , agitation , hostility change behavior , typical patient , patient suicidal ideation suicidal behavior . These patient unblinded , withdrawn study , record case serious adverse event ( SAE ) . They follow least 28 day stop treatment monitor complication . Intervention hospital admission : On day surgery , patient take one pill 1.0 mg medication ( match placebo ) surgery . They resume take medication soon possible surgery accord treatment schedule . At 24 hour surgery discharge time ( day-surgery patient ) , i.e . postoperative visit , patient receive rest medication whole treatment period , i.e . two bottle medication ( placebo ) one contain 66 X 1.0 mg tab ( 28 day X 2 tablet = 56 tablet plus10 5-day window ) rest treatment . Any interruption treatment might happen due patient surgical condition ( e.g . patient abdominal surgery , etc . ) record take account final sub-analysis . The second counseling session discharge day-surgery patient 24 hrs surgery . Participants visit study coordinator hospital review smoking status encourage future abstinence . The self-reported preoperative abstinence verify measurement expired carbon monoxide ( COE ) urinary cotinine patient . Patients receive counsel special emphasis skill associate relapse prevention remain abstinent second week research suggest abstinence time period highly predictive success ( Kenford et al 1994 ) promote surgical healing ( Warner et al 2004 ) . Patients also inform benefit long-term cessation encourage continue pharmacotherapy . Long-term follow telephone counsel discharge : Participants group also provide telephone counseling . For first 4 week start treatment , patient receive weekly phone call end 8 week . The purpose call report smoking status help encourage continue long-term abstinence .

The smoking status , stage change . cigarette smoked/ day also report 24- 52- week follow-up phone call . To verify self-reports abstinence , also mail NicAlert urine cotinine strip ( Accutest ) 24 52 week treatment patient along instruction test . Patients ask telephone call test return strip use prepaid return envelops include small plastic pouch . Patients follow 52 week start treatment . Participants group receive follow visit study coordinator research assistant hospital stay i.e. , discharge day surgery patient 24 hrs surgery . Patients group receive weekly follow call first 4 week end 8 week start treatment . At end treatment period , i.e . 12 week patient come visited hospital .
