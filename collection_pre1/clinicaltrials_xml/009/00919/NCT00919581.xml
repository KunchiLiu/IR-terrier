	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate inflammatory substance may elevate blood blood cell follow spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . These substance evaluate sample people spinal cord injury due trauma ( e.g . car accident fall ) within first week ( acute ) least one year ago ( chronic ) . Specifically , study evaluate presence level protein , macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF ) . MIF release cell specific effect way cell behave , communicate work together . In several medical condition , MIF know increase inflammation body . By compare blood sample individual spinal cord injury uninjured ( spinal cord injury ) individual , investigator try find MIF level increase people SCI . Investigators also use sample measure proteins increase inflammation body see biological activity MIF reduce test tube add substance blood sample . It hop study MIF protein related inflammation help improve treatment SCI future . We hope enroll total 312 subject study ( 50 acute spinal cord injury , 125 chronic spinal cord injury , 137 uninjured individual ) .</brief_summary>
