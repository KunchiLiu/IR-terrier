	<brief_summary>The blood vessel carry blood heart rest body normally capable relax constrict need provide less blood body . The inability blood vessel relax widen may increase risk heart disease stroke . One potential cause inability inflammation . Because HIV infection associate inflammation , possible blood vessel people infect HIV may relax properly . The purpose study determine whether people infect HIV bad blood vessel function people without HIV infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Blood Vessel Endothelial Function HIV-Infected People Matched HIV-Uninfected People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Normally inside blood vessel either widen narrow response need less blood flow . This function endothelial cell , cell line inner layer blood vessel . However , people endothelial function impair , may put increase risk heart disease stroke . It widely assume HIV-infected people yet receive antiretroviral medication experience impair endothelial function HIV-uninfected people , possibly link HIV inflammation . However , rigorously control study yet perform verify presumption . It important establish whether HIV infection , use antiretroviral medication , indeed cause impaired endothelial function . This study compare endothelial function people HIV already receive antiretroviral medication people without HIV . Specifically , inflammation , immune activation , endothelial activation , metabolic measure compare . This study involve two group participant . The first group consist people HIV enrol two separate HIV study ( NCT00864916 NCT00796822 ) , one last 8 week last 48 week . The second group consist people without HIV similar first group term age , sex , smoke status , height . All HIV-infected participant undergo assessment study visit whichever HIV study enrol . All HIV-uninfected participant attend main study visit include follow : review medical record family medical history ; measurement blood pressure , heart rate , weight , temperature , waist hip circumference ; blood urine collection ; procedure call brachial artery reactivity testing , noninvasive way measure endothelial function . Some HIV-uninfected participant continue study change endothelial function assess . They attend either two additional study visit Weeks 4 8 , correspond one HIV study , three additional study visit Weeks 8 , 24 , 48 , correspond HIV study . The additional visit include repeat test except blood urine collection .</detailed_description>
