	<brief_title>My Scrivener® - Measuring Effectiveness Dose Response Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study build large body neurological research use robot-guided repetitive motion training induce neuroplasticity improvement upper extremity motor skill adults child . This research study look handwriting , fine-motor task use daily . In study , want see 3-dimensional robotic-assisted repetitive motion training safe effective intervention school-age child fine motor deficit arise several different impairment origin . Our research construct : Legible handwrite = function ( tactile feedback , visual feedback , duration , fine-motor control ) . Independent variable : - Tactile feedback continuous variable force-feedback measure pound force . - Duration continuous variable measure second number repetition . - Visual feedback letter scribe paper . Dependent variable : - Legible handwriting measure score Test Handwriting Skills Print Tool™ evaluation . - Fine motor deficit/control measure directly objectively quantify error desire scribe task actual scribing task . The robotic device affordable ( &lt; $ 200 ) computer haptic ( Falcon ( R ) ) currently approve FCC home office . It *not* approve medical use . This investigational , nonsignificant risk device .</detailed_description>
