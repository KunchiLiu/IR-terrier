	<brief_title>Collecting Storing Tissue , Blood , Bone Marrow Samples From Patients With Rhabdomyosarcoma Other Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Collect human tumor tissue biological specimen ( blood , serum , bone marrow ) patient rhabdomyosarcoma non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma diagnose and/or treated Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) member institution . II . Provide repository storage tissue biological specimen collect COG investigator patient . III . Make specimens available approved project laboratory-based investigator . IV . Collect clinical data patient treat COG therapeutic study . V. Define compare clinical feature patient subgroup alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma whose tumor carry ( 2 ; 13 ) , ( 1 ; 13 ) neither translocation . VI . Investigate relationship evidence submicroscopic disease response rate ( CR/PR ) , failure-free survival , survival patient alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma , determine positive negative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) assay ( 2:13 ) ( 1:13 ) peripheral blood bone marrow specimen obtain diagnosis . VII . Compare clinical , cytogenetic , molecular biologic feature patient subgroup anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes rhabdomyosarcoma . OUTLINE : Surgical tissue , bone marrow , blood specimen collect diagnosis ( initial relapse ) , applicable , development second primary tumor . Specimens use research purpose . A certificate confidentiality protect identity research participant project issue National Cancer Institute . Patients enrol Children 's Oncology Group treatment trial follow every 6 month least 10 year disease progression development second malignancy .</detailed_description>
