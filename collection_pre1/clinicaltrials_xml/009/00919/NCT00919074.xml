	<brief_summary>This research project compare use double wire technique placement pancreatic duct ( PD ) stent achieve deep biliary cannulation without use precut papillotomy . Currently , data support either approach limit referenced case series . More data success complication rate technique need . The investigator believe either approach would prefer less experienced endoscopists precut papillotomy . Consequently , important differentiate technique identify patient may benefit one .</brief_summary>
