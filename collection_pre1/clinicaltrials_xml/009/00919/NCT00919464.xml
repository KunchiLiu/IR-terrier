	<brief_title>Natural History Anterior Compartment Pressures Thigh Following Femur Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compartment syndrome painful condition increase tissue pressure restrict area compromise circulation endangers tissue within area possibly lead surgery , amputation , major loss function rare case , death . Compartment syndrome thigh particularly devastating size muscle large amount blood flow area , however one rare therefore least understood compartment syndrome . The purpose study determine natural history pressure anterior compartment thigh follow femur fracture , could help elucidate diagnostic treatment algorithm thigh compartment syndrome . This small project design non-randomized , investigational prospective trail conduct General Division Charleston Area Medical Center . The target population consist male non-pregnant female age 18 suffer mid-shaft femur fracture .</detailed_description>
