	<brief_summary>This study retrospective electronic medical chart review patient admit adult intensive care medicine unit ( ICU ) The Nebraska Medical Center three-year period January 2006 December 2008 . The study three primary aim : - Aim 1 : Determine correlate ( qualify criterion ) patient initiated enteral versus parenteral PPIs first choice ICU discharge ICU , - Aim 2 : Based correlate determine number patient receive parenteral PPIs could receive enteral therapy first choice ICU discharge ICU , - Aim 3 : Estimate potential saving drug cost associate conversion eligible patient parenteral enteral PPI therapy emphasis lansoprazole solutab ICU conversion eligible patient require continue AST parenteral enteral PPI therapy discharge ICU .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Economic Outcomes Enteral Parenteral Proton Pump Inhibitor ( PPI ) Use Intensive Care Unit ( ICU )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE : Detail : Proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) commonly use intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient various clinical condition , include acute stress relate gastrointestinal bleeding ( ASRGIB ) clinically significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding ( UGIB ) . Although randomized prospective clinical trial limit PPIs agent suppress gastric acid , Joint Commission Accreditation Healthcare Organizations ( JCAHO ) require patient receive acid-suppressive therapy admission ICU . Physicians pharmacist tend choose parenteral route PPI administration rather enteral route despite several potential advantage administration gastrointestinal tract . Factors support enteral PPI administration include : ease PPIs formulate liquid suspension , high bioavailability healthy patient , efficacy show great intravenous histamine-2 receptor antagonist ( H2RA ) therapy , low acquisition cost . In fact , study complete healthy patient demonstrate enterally administer PPIs may lead great acid suppression parenterally administer PPIs mg-for-mg basis . A potential limitation associate use gut administer medication critically ill patient relate whether drug adequately absorb . We repeatedly show institution ( 650 bed teach hospital 54 ICU bed ) seriously ill patient , adequately absorb enterally administer PPIs provide equal superior acid suppression profile compare equivalent dos PPIs administer parenterally . Limited information available utilization trend associate potential cost saving use enteral therapy compare parenteral PPI administration ICU set . Lansoprazole oral solutab use ICU hospital setting may lead cost saving reduce lengthy preparation ease administration compare enterally administer PPIs like omeprazole , pantoprazole esomeprazole . Therefore , inform formulary decision cost-effective quality care , propose real-world retrospective study correlate economic outcome term potential saving drug cost use enteral PPI include lansoprazole solutab compare parenteral PPI use ICU . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Overview : Study Design : This study retrospective electronic medical chart review patient admit adult intensive care medicine unit ( ICU ) The Nebraska Medical Center three-year period January 2006 December 2008 . Following investigational review board ( IRB ) approval , computerized list patient admit ICU designate period generate . Using laboratory personal , patient review data record access data base . Data collect outcomes laboratory 400 square foot room housing 5 computer equip related software connect PHAMIS , hospital electronic medical record institution . Subjects : Inclusion Criteria : All patient great 18 year admit ICU 2006-2008 ( January 2006 December 2008 ; 3-year period ) Exclusion Criteria Patients ineligible receive PPI ( e.g . hypersensitivity PPI ) Sample size : We average 2,500 eligible patient per year admit ICU . So anticipate final sample size nearly 5000 patient would give u meaningful indication real-world use cost estimate . Procedures : Data Collection : All data collect access file database ease analysis . Demographic data collect include : APACHE II score , age , gender , underlie illness , ICU admission diagnosis gut function , enteral parenteral nutrition , include tubes place . In addition length hospital , ICU stay , death hospitalization record . We also record type , route , duration dose acid-suppressive therapy , ICU admission detail medication administer ICU stay.To aid drug cost calculation , PPI associate preparation administration time also record observation 30 ICU admission enteral parenteral PPI group . Drug cost base 2008 Red book average wholesale price drug resource utilization cost base hospital billing data . Data analysis Interpretation : Descriptive Summary : We report descriptive statistic term proportion enteral parenteral PPI use ( dose duration ) ICU discharge ICU . We also report patient , disease , resource utilization ( continuous measure PPI dose duration , PPI associate preparation administration time , length stay ( LOS ) ICU , ICU , hospital ) characteristic two PPI group ( enteral include Lansoprazole solutab versus parenteral ) . Further , use micro-costing procedure estimate economic outcome i.e . cost dollar associated drug resource utilization ( PPI dose duration , PPI associate preparation administration time ) two group . Savings drug cost also compute dollar calculate difference parenteral enteral PPI group . Death hospitalization also report . Analyses primary aim follow - Aim 1 : The proportion PPI patient initiated parenteral PPI enteral PPI compare statistically significant difference ICU patient disease characteristic use suitable ( chi-square Fischer 's exact ) test . The use two PPI group may confound patient disease characteristic . To adjust confound factor , multivariate regression modeling use . We carry multivariate logistic regression model compare odds enteral versus parenteral PPI use . Aim 2 : Number patient ( mean +/- SD ) initiate parenteral PPIs could receive enteral therapy first choice ICU discharge ICU estimate . Aim 3 : Savings drug cost associate conversion eligible patient parenteral enteral PPI therapy ICU conversion eligible patient require continue AST parenteral enteral PPI therapy discharge ICU report mean normal distribution median skew distribution . Analyses secondary aim follow - For secondary aim 1 , compare proportion patient initiated enteral parenteral PPIs use chi-square fisher exact test . For secondary aim 2 , 3 , compare mean median resource economic outcome variable two PPI group use independent sample t-test Wilcoxon rank sum test skew distribution , respectively .</detailed_description>
