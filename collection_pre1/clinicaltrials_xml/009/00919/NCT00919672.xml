	<brief_summary>Sacral nerve stimulation ( SNS ) become well-established treatment patient fecal incontinence since 1995 . The mechanism action SNS still fully understood recent study show motility whole colon modulate stimulation . This modulation colonic motility could potential mechanism action relieve symptom patient IBS . Twenty eight patient IBS enrol study . They meet ROME III criterion , also satisfy criterion implantation neurostimulator . After post implantation period program neurostimulator optimise , patient randomize double blind design receive either ON-OFF OFF-ON stimulation 2-month period . At end period ( ON/OFF ) patient examine Magnet Tracking System ( MTS ) motility impedance planimetry include thermal stimulation ( circulate water ) multimodal sensory test rectum . This base study hypothesis motility small intestine colon change IBS patient accord subtype ( Diarrhoea-IBS , Constipation-IBS Disordered bowel habit-IBS ) compare healthy person . And SNS affect motility small intestine colon IBS patient well SNS affect perception pain/discomfort rectum IBS patient . The effect ON-OFF-sacral nerve stimulation IBS patient thereby IBS symptom also evaluate IBS score ( GSRS-IBS ) quality life IBS Impact Scale ( IBS-IS ) well significance placebo effect treatment patient IBS SNS evaluate .</brief_summary>
