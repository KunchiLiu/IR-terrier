	<brief_summary>The goal study identify non-invasive predictor predictor increase clinician 's ability identify patient preterm labor ( PTL ) risk preterm delivery ( PTD ) . Through study also hope reveal potential therapeutic target prevention prevention preterm birth . The study hypothesis identify non-invasive predictor PTL risk PTD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN This prospective study involve cohort pregnant subject pre-term labor . Maternal blood cervical/vaginal fluid collect consent subject preterm labor . Repeat sample cervical fluid occur often weekly time delivery . Relevant clinical demographic data record . Levels prostaglandins ( PG 's ) , lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase ( L-PGDS ) cytokine determine use ELISA . DNA also extract maternal blood SNP analysis cytokine gene . At time delivery , cord blood placenta sample collect logistically possible ( regular laboratory hour ) . To determine fetal level PG 's , L-PGDS cytokine cord blood analyze use ELISA . Placental sample use vitro study aim investigating placental regulatory pathway cytokine PG production . Placental sample also process embedded paraffin use immunohistochemical study order localize expression PG 's cytokine . Clinical delivery data also record . Gender Subjects . Only female subject include . Age Subjects . The age subject restrict 18-45 year . Inclusion Criteria . Women diagnosis preterm labor include study . Preterm labor diagnose Six contraction per hour associate one following : 1. cervical dilation &gt; = 2 cm 2. cervical effacement &gt; 80 % 3. document change dilation effacement OR Cervical length le 2.5 cm ultrasound without contraction . Exclusion Criteria . Multiple pregnancy , fetal anomaly , abruptio placenta , preeclampsia , cervical dilation great 4 cm , clinical sign infection vaginal bleeding . Subject Capacity . All subject include study capacity give inform consent .</detailed_description>
