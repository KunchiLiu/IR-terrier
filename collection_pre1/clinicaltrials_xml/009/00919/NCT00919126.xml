	<brief_title>General Anesthesia With Xenon Inspiratory Concentrations 50 % 70 % Total I.V . Anaesthesia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The inert `` noble '' gas Xenon anaesthetic property recognize 50 year ago . Several preclinical study investigation use xenon inhalational anaesthetic human perform report gas many property ideal anaesthetic agent . Moreover , know xenon combine volatile anaesthetic opioids , require dos substance reduce , result low incidence side effect . Patients could benefit administration xenon inspired concentration would result reduced dos co-administered drug . This trial allow evaluate propofol consumption require combination xenon administer inspiratory concentration 50 % 70 % maintain comparable depth general anaesthesia total i.v . anaesthesia , ASA III patient present increase risk perioperative cardiac complication undergo laparotomy orthopaedic surgery .</detailed_description>
