	<brief_summary>Infection dengue viruses one leading cause hospitalization death child several tropical Asian county . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate virus responsible 50 million case dengue fever ( DF ) approximately 0.5 million case severe disease , dengue hemorrhagic fever/ shock syndrome ( DHF/DSS ) annually . Because dengue virus endemic tropical subtropical region , keep 2 billion person risk acquire dengue , WHO make development dengue vaccine top priority . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness candidate DEN4 vaccine aim prevent infection dengue virus serotype 4 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dengue virus endemic tropical subtropical region world 2 billion person risk acquire dengue . There four serotypes dengue virus ( DEN 1 , DEN 2 , DEN 3 , DEN 4 ) capable cause dengue illness range mild , self-limited febrile illness life-threatening disease . Because previous infection one dengue serotype increase risk DHF/DSS follow infection different serotype , immunization would ideally provide immunity four dengue viral serotypes . Several live , attenuated dengue vaccine test Phase I and/or Phase II clinical trial . Although appeared promise early trial , none able meet requirement safe effective vaccine . Meeting requirement particularly difficult test vaccine contain four serotypes . The vaccine candidate study live-attenuated rDEN4delta30 , target DEN4 serotype , potential component future tetravalent dengue vaccine . This double-blind , random assignment , placebo-controlled study healthy , adult volunteer . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness single dose DEN4 vaccine . Some participant receive placebo comparative measure , good assess vaccine-associated versus non vaccine-associated adverse event . To qualify participation study , volunteer undergo eligibility screen include medical history , physical exam , hematology testing , liver renal function testing , coagulation study , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) hepatitis B C screening , urinalysis , screen pervious flavivirus infection . Urine pregnancy test also require female volunteer . Duration individual participation study approximately 26 week follow vaccination Study Day 0 . Volunteers randomly assign receive either rDEN4delta30 placebo ; 50 participant receive vaccine , 20 receive placebo . On day vaccination , volunteer reassess study personnel ensure continue eligibility , vital sign take , physical exam perform . Female participant also pregnancy test review acceptable pregnancy prevention method . Eligible participant receive vaccination Study Day 0 , follow 30 minute post vaccination assessment adverse event . After vaccination , volunteer evaluate clinic approximately every day first 16 day study . During course study , volunteer blood draw clinical evaluation perform Study Days 21 , 28 , 42 , 180 post-vaccination . All participant ask record oral temperature 3 time day first 16 day post-vaccination .</detailed_description>
