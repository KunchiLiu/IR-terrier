	<brief_summary>Anecdotal evidence suggest female patient painful bladder disorder interstitial cystitis ( IC ) experience significant attenuation system breastfeed . Since show postpartum lactation time associate decreased level stress , stress show exacerbate IC-related pain , investigator develop interest effect hormone involve postpartum lactation stress pain . Based series pre-clinical experiment , investigator believe hormone oxytoxin analgesic anxiolytic property make potentially useful agent treatment stress-exacerbated chronic pain syndrome IC . Therefore , investigator propose double-blinded , placebo-controlled crossover trial intranasal oxytocin vs. intranasal saline bladder pain cohort patient IC degree continuous , daily pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intranasal Oxytocin Treatment Pain Associated With Interstitial Cystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty patient enrol double-blinded , placebo-controlled single-dose crossover trial compare intranasal oxytocin intranasal saline . At time enrollment , patient complete series standardize questionnaire detail information IC-related symptom baseline well comorbid condition , cop mechanism ( specifically catastrophizing ) , baseline rating overall pain , depression , anxiety , global functioning . Once information obtain , patient receive one-time dose intranasal oxytocin equivalent volume intranasal saline . The patient monitor one hour physician investigator toxicity efficacy contact follow-up information 2 , 4 , 6 , 24 hour . At time point , patient ask report verbal pain report , verbal anxiety report , number void since last contact investigator , use additional medication pain control anxiety . In addition , global response assessment ( GRA ) score obtain 6 24 hour . The patient ask return within one week period time he/she receive alternative intranasal agent . Following second dose , patient monitor one hour contact make 2 , 4 , 6 , 24 hour previously describe . The primary outcome measure GRA score , analyze use Chi-square analysis follow Fischer 's exact test . Secondary outcome measure analyze via ANOVA . If study indicate intranasal oxytocin efficacious pain control , could provide alternative current ineffective invasive treatment IC-related pain . It also possible could eventually utilized form chronic pain well .</detailed_description>
