	<brief_summary>The incorporation continuous glucose sensor ( CGS ) management type 1 diabetes adolescence could improve treatment outcome . But , behavioral barrier may prevent adolescent enjoy optimal benefit new technology . This study randomize adolescent ( 11 yet 17 year old ) type 1 diabetes least 2 year achieve target HbA1c level ( &gt; 7.5 % ) continue standard care ( SC ) , add continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) care appropriate education medical management ( CGS ) add CGM care also receive support assistance behavior therapist assist patient family optimize adolescent ' therapeutic benefit CGS ( CGS+BT ) . A variety outcomes measure , include blood glucose control , quality life , CGS satisfaction impact . An enrollment criterion study adolescent must establish consistent care type 1 diabetes Nemours Children 's Clinic location either Wilmington , DE , Philadelphia , PA , Orlando , FL Pensacola , FL least 12 month prior enrollment study . Adolescents treat elsewhere eligible enroll study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Continuous Glucose Sensors Adolescents With Inadequate Diabetic Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Management type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) adolescents difficult innovative approach need help achieve good glycemic control behavioral outcome . Continuous glucose sensor ( CGS ) refine progressively provide acceptably accurate , nearly continuous estimate glucose level trend . This increased quality quantity glucose data could excellent adjunct conventional self-monitoring blood glucose , permit inform diabetes decision-making . CGS could yield medical , educational psychological benefit adolescent T1DM , extremely variable self-management habit suboptimal glycemic control may realize benefit readily . We hypothesize target , family-focused behavioral intervention could optimize benefit add CGS T1DM therapy youth glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) &gt; 7.5 % . A multi-site sample 150 adolescent T1DM HbA1C 7.5 % 10.0 % randomize either Standard Care T1DM ( SC ) , augmentation SC 9 month ' use CGS device ( CGS ) use CGS device supplement targeted behavior therapy intervention ( CGS+BT ) . Multiple measure glycemic control , glycemic variability health care use obtain study periodic assessment demographic factor , diabetes self-management , family relation psychological adjustment . Three specific aim address : 1 . Evaluate whether CGS+BT yield improvement glycemic outcome CGS SC ; 2 . Evaluate whether CGS+BT yield improvement behavioral outcome CGS SC ; 3 . Identify behavioral variable mediate moderate glycemic benefit use CGS device . The study also compare cost effectiveness CGS CGS+BT relative SC evaluate predictive utility various index glycemic variability youth . We hypothesize , compare SC CGS , CGS+BT yield significantly well biomedical outcome ( HbA1C ; severe hypoglycemia ; glycemic variability ; proportion glucose reading normal range ) behavioral outcome ( treatment adherence ; parent adolescent teamwork ; diabetes-related family conflict ; quality life ; fear hypoglycemia ; treatment satisfaction ) . After 9 month randomize trial , youth allow use CGS device additional 3-month continuation phase . Statistical analysis base individual growth model technique . The application capitalize Principal Investigator 's prior ongoing fund research family management T1DM , include trial family-focused behavioral intervention , intensive therapy regimen , clinical evaluation continuous glucose sensor . The propose study determine whether targeted behavioral intervention improve CGS benefit among adolescent previously inadequate glycemic control . These result could demonstrate adolescent previously suboptimal diabetic control could realize multiple benefit CGS use provide specialized behavioral intervention .</detailed_description>
