	<brief_title>Combination Therapy Treatment Rosacea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rosacea common cutaneous disorder characterize facial erythema , papule pustule telangiectasias . The clinical manifestation disorder distribute along convexity face cheek , chin , nose central aspect forehead . The flushing telangiectasias associate erythematotelangietatic rosacea ( ETR ) notoriously difficult treat standard medication . Patients ETR low threshold irritation topically apply drug substance may even exacerbate symptom . Pulsed dye laser ( PDL ) widely consider treatment choice vascular malformation include telangiectasias , port wine stain hemangioma . Several study show successful treatment rosacea-associated telangiectasia erythema pulse dye laser . Moreover , calcium dobesilate ( 2,5-dihydroxybenzene sulfonate ) drug inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell growth inhibit cellular proliferation . As synthetic inhibitor fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) , calcium dobesilate target angiogenic growth factor lead uncontrolled blood vessel growth . In light fact angiogenesis implicate erythematotelangietatic rosacea , calcium dobesilate useful treatment subtype rosacea . Thus , combination treatment PDL calcium dobsilate act synergistic manner reduce erythema , flush telangectasia associate erythematotelangietatic rosacea . If subject meet inclusion criterion inform consent obtain , subject receive 2.5 % calcium dobesilate get apply half face ( randomize ) . The subject also receive pulse dye laser treatment whole face two week interval maximum 3 treatment . The primary endpoint study severity rosacea end 20 week study .</detailed_description>
