	<detailed_description>Fibroids ( leiomyoma ) benign tumor originate musculature uterus . They common cause removal uterus woman . Surgery final definitive treatment fibroid . However , surgery relatively risky . Hence , medical therapy try woman wish preserve uterus . However , therapy side effect prohibit routine use . Recent report demonstrate role new category drug call aromatase inhibitor ( Femara ) treatment fibroid . To best knowledge , drug study yet management fibroid uterus apart one case report . The objective current study ass effect aromatase inhibitor , specifically Femara ( letrozole ) size fibroid woman around menopause . We hop decrease size , could avoid patient undergo surgery . The data generate invaluable sense .</detailed_description>
