	<brief_title>Does Nasal Instillation Miglustat Normalize Nasal Potential Difference Cystic Fibrosis Patients ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Miglustat inhibitor Î±-glucosidases enzyme . Oral miglustat currently market Europa US treatment Gaucher type 1 patient enzyme replacement treatment option . Gastro-intestinal side effect common formulation . This medication show beneficial effect Cl- Na+ transport cystic fibrosis epithelial cell . In addition , single airway delivery low-dose Miglustat normalizes nasal potential difference ( NPD ) F508del cystic fibrosis mouse . NPD abnormalities specific CF patient consider reflect primary defect CFTR protein curative treatment expect correct least partially . In field respiratory pharmacology , general rule inhale route favour whenever possible : usually effective despite much low dos systemic absorption ( also imply low cost improve tolerance ) . The aim study investigate effect single local administration Miglustat NPD measurement CF patient homozygous F508del mutation .</detailed_description>
