	<brief_title>Pazopanib Second Line Therapy Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer Refractory Total Androgen Blockade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VEGF expression low normal prostate tissue , markedly increase tumor tissue , positive association MVD ( micro vessel density ) tumor stage , grade , disease-specific survival patient prostate cancer . VEGF known influence HIF-1α , also up-regulated majority prostate cancer tissue . It show complete androgen blockade down-regulates VEGF expression via HIF-1α pathway concomitant up-regulation thrombospondin induction endothelial cell apoptosis . The VEGF pathway appear dominant vascular formation pathway prostate cancer bFGF less role . Pazopanib , hydrochloride salt , small molecule inhibitor several tyrosine kinase , ie : VEGF 1 , 2 , 3 , c-KIT platelet-derived growth factor receptor . The broad blockade VEGF receptor interfere VEGF/VEGF-receptor pathway , impact cell growth . According NCCN guideline , first line therapy metastatic prostate cancer consider total androgen blockade , either utilize orchiectomy and/or LH/RH agonist plus Casodex . Second line therapy would depend patient 's response first line therapy , urgency response , location metastatic disease . Pazopanib explore several setting . It recently look Bicalutamide hormone refractory prostate cancer . The second study earlier disease , i.e . D-0 relapse androgen-sensitive patient . The University Chicago study look sub-population prostate cancer patient `` chemical relapse '' patient give one shot Lupron , PSA adequately suppress , patient randomize pazopanib placebo .</detailed_description>
