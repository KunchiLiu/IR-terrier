	<brief_summary>Neurodevelopmental outcome child treat cancer involve central nervous system ( CNS ) provide educator new challenge regard classification , monitoring , intervention regular special education classroom set . Recommendations result serial neurodevelopmental evaluation child often overlap traditional special education recommendation commonly include Individual Education Plans ( IEPs ) child congenital genetic learning problem . The investigator currently know whether school-based treatment learn problem , base child 's IEP , incorporate recommendation make base neurodevelopmental evaluation appropriately . In addition , clear whether recommendation include child 's IEP beneficial outcome child 's learning academic achievement time . The purpose project examine relationship neurodevelopmental outcome , recommendation intervention , special education service accommodation include child 's school IEP , outcome child follow implementation IEP . The study two major specific aim : 1 . To quantify clinical educational contribution recommendation result neurodevelopmental evaluation subsequent development IEPs . Hypothesis 1.1 : Higher concordance recommendation make base neurodevelopmental evaluation criterion write child 's IEPs associate positive academic outcome ( i.e . maintenance improvement academic skill ) . Hypothesis 1.2 : Children high concordance criterion write IEPs academic service actually receive show positive academic outcome child whose IEP criteria academic service less concordant . 2 . To evaluate intervention improve academic outcome child treat cancer . Hypothesis 2.1 : Children whose IEPs monitor frequently show positive academic outcome peer whose IEPs monitor less frequently .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For year , researcher examine effect cancer treatment child 's neurodevelopment . This body research identify number specific threats child 's cognitive functioning academic achievement , due acute effect late effect cancer treatment . These often translate difficulty academic setting . Specifically , area cognitive behavioral development frequently affect , lead concomitant difficulty academic achievement social interaction . Previous research indicate developmental effect concomitant difficulty particularly notable child treat brain tumor leukemias central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement . Neurodevelopmental assessment conduct part clinical evaluation serve identify individual strength weaknesses child treat . Results assessment used formulate recommendation target compensate weakness accentuate strengths child . Child Study Team meeting schedule , parent 's request , child 's school order use recommendation develop Individual Educational Plans ( IEPs ) best meet special need student . At present , formal follow-up procedure exist ensure IEPs implemented appropriately , effective meeting identify special need child . The present study propose 1 ) evaluate IEP implementation process child cancer , 2 ) evaluate effectiveness IEPs help improve academic outcome child cancer , 3 ) evaluate influence academic outcomes high-monitoring follow-up intervention child cancer . To address objective , school-aged child central nervous system tumor , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , lymphoma administer neurodevelopmental assessment measure specific educational need may . The result neurodevelopmental assessment provide parent feedback session question concern regard evaluation address . At time feedback session , parent inform IEP process request contact school request Child Study Team Meeting take place . The study personnel offer attend meeting parent . Results assessment use help guide recommendation make academic placement accommodation per school 's guideline . Children cancer assign either quarterly follow-up annual follow-up group . For child quarterly follow-up group , parent primary teacher ( primary teacher identify parent/guardian teacher contact child and/or know child best ) ask provide information end grading period ( 4 times/year ) regard child 's performance , progress , adherence IEP develop . For child yearly follow-up group , information collect end academic year . Children quarterly annual follow-up group re-assessed annually total 3 year evaluate change neurodevelopmental function academic achievement . Children two experimental group administer neurodevelopmental evaluation , , addition , receive academic follow-up either quarterly annual basis , depend upon group randomize . Enrollment ongoing basis participant follow 3 year enrollment , receive neurodevelopmental evaluation year final endpoint evaluation year 4 ( total 4 neurodevelopmental evaluation ) .</detailed_description>
