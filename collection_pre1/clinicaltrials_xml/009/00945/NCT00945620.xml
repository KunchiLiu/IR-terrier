	<brief_summary>The primary aim study measure magnitude duration trans-abdominis plane ( TAP ) block analgesia parturients undergo elective cesarean section concurrent standard care operative analgesic regimen include intrathecal morphine sulfate ( ITMS ) . A one side block model take advantage bilateral nature pain create bilateral surgical wound allow patient serve control . Reduced variability allow definitive establishment analgesic benefit block . The current report conflict data regard efficacy make uncertain role TAP block post cesarean section pain relief . This model would better potential measuring block 's effectiveness . Quantitative sensory evaluation tool von Frey hair tool provide quantitative reproducible measure skin sensation also allow assessment block regression time . Pressure algometry establish clinical research tool quantitative assessment pain level multiple pain condition . A useful inexpensive reliable pressure algometer recently describe . The assessment serum ropivicaine level block provide useful data regard systemic absorption local anesthetic compare peripheral nerve block establish safety technique . In addition study help establish model study TAP block modification future . If block effectiveness demonstrate , model use examine numerous block parameter include choice local anesthetic dose response analysis optimal volume concentration . Potential future study may do also area adjunct find increased duration effectiveness use peripheral nerve block . Expected duration study 18 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blinded prospective trial . Group A patient randomized receive TAP block local anesthetic right , sham block leave . Group B randomize receive reverse . The study population limit healthy parturients undergo elective caesarian section spinal anesthesia ( SAB ) combine spinal-epidural anesthesia ( CSE ) place operate room time surgery . Patient recruitment : Prior enrollment study inform consent obtain . Consent obtain study investigator blind group patient randomize . After preanesthetic counseling patient agreement SAB CSE cesarean delivery counsel patient regard study participation . Pre-operative instruction VAS scale shall give investigator . Routine pre-operative preparation per current protocol occur . Intra-operative Anesthetic Regimen : Anesthetic technique per current protocol . A single intravenous infusion use intraoperative infusion intravenous fluid anesthetic maintenance infusion blood sample ropivicaine level follow TAP block placement . SAB CSE utilize 12 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine , 0.15mg intrathecal morphine shall use spinal anesthetic study patient . Intra-operative conduct anesthesia leave discretion anesthesiologist care parturient . TAP Block Protocol : At end surgical procedure , new exclusion criterion , subject randomize receive bilateral TAP block use 30 mL contain 300 mg ropivicaine ( 1 % ) addition 1:300,000 epinephrine one side ( Group A right ) , sham needle placement ( Group B right ) . During procedure study subject shall blind group assignment surgical drapes.. The investigator record patient assessment present block placement . The un-blinded anesthesia provider remove open 1 22 opaque envelope contain card identify group patient assign computer generate randomization . The provider prepare injection syrinx , label ropivicaine syringe RIGHT LEFT accord randomization . The envelope seal place patient 's study packet . An unblinded investigator train block technique use ultrasound guidance perform block . The TAP block shall perform fashion describe Carney et . al ( 5 ) . region triangle Petit locate superior aspect iliac crest , use 22g regional block needle , utilize 2 pop technique ( 2 ) needle tip position verify ultrasound imaging . The investigator confirm placement injectate fascial plane initial injection small amount local anesthetic drug follow injection rest dose ultrasound verification anesthetic deposition internal oblique transversus abdominis . The ultrasound image print include study data.. The side receive sham needle placement without medication injection . Because block perform regression spinal anesthesia , cause pain subject . Post-Block Care : Following placement block , parturients receive standard post-operative analgesic regimen represent routine practice : - Toradol 15mg IV upon completion surgery . - Percocet 5/325mg q 4 hr PRN ( pain ) - Motrin 600mg q 6 hour PRN ( pain ) The time first analgesic request administration record . The total amount supplemental analgesic administer record first 48 hour . Following block placement , venous blood shall draw set interval describe indwell venous catheter ass ropivicaine level .</detailed_description>
