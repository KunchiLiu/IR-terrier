	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate effectiveness increase prescribed patch treatment 2 6 daily hour visual acuity stabilize initial treatment amblyopia still present . Children age 3 &lt; 8 year visual acuity 20/50 20/400 amblyopic eye enrol run-in phase 2 hour daily patch improvement , follow randomization eligible patient patch 2 hour daily versus average 6 hour daily ( 42 hour per week ) . The primary objective determine increase patch dosage improve visual acuity patient amblyopia still present visual acuity stabilize initial treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Amblyopia common cause monocular visual impairment child young middle-aged adult . Both patch atropine accept treatment modality management moderate amblyopia children.1 Many practitioner prescribe 2 hour daily patch initial therapy amblyopia . However , many child fail achieve normal visual acuity amblyopic eye regimen . In randomized trial conduct PEDIG compare patch regimen , 71 92 patient moderate amblyopia ( 77 % ) amblyopic eye visual acuity 20/32 bad 4 month patch 2 hour daily.2 In another PEDIG randomize trial compare patch spectacle alone period refractive adaptation , patient treat 2 hour daily patch follow every 5 week improvement amblyopic eye acuity . Fifty-five 70 patient moderate amblyopia ( 79 % ) 14 14 patient severe amblyopia ( 100 % ) best-measured amblyopic eye visual acuity 20/32 bad median treatment period 10 weeks.3 When improvement initial therapy stop amblyopia still present , treatment option include increase dosage current treatment , switch another treatment , maintain treatment dosage additional month , combine treatment . Many clinician choose increase dosage current treatment , part family become comfortable particular mode treatment . However , unknown whether increase occlusion dosage improve amblyopic eye visual acuity patient . We unaware report response intensify treatment amblyopia .</detailed_description>
