	<brief_title>Erythropoietin Infants With Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy ( HIE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During HIE free radical generate within mitochondrion also byproducts synthesis prostaglandins.These free radical ignite secondary phase subsequent damage brain attack membranal fatty acid . Nitric oxide ( NO ) involve cascade metabolic event contribute HIE . It mediate , part , cytotoxic activity macrophage , induces relaxation blood vessel , also act neurotransmitter central peripheral nervous system . Therefore , therapeutic value NO synthase inhibitor , among many agent use ameliorate course HIE , currently investigation experimental animal . Erythropoietin ( EPO ) cytokine originally identify role erythropoiesis recently show produced central nervous system.Relative insufficiency endogenous EPO period ischemic stress may trigger neuronal apoptosis , whereas provision exogenous EPO show inhibit process . The potential immediate protective effect EPO include decreased NO production , activation antioxidant enzyme , reduction glutamate toxicity , inhibition lipid peroxidation , reduction inflammation . Long-term protective effect EPO include generation neuronal anti-apoptotic mechanism , stimulation angiogenesis , modulation neurogenesis . Preliminary data support protective role exogenous EPO neuronal cell . The presence EPO rescue vitro culture neuron NO-induced death . It specifically protect cultured neuron N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor-mediated glutamate toxicity . Intercerebroventricular injection EPO offer significant protection neuronal tissue animal focal cerebral ischemia . EPO able cross blood brain barrier , concentration cerebrospinal fluid normal rat significantly increase within 30 minute follow intravenous administration . EPO also offer neuronal protection administer systemically animal suffer global focal cerebral ischemia . In adult patient stroke , administration EPO ameliorate course disease . Therefore , EPO recently receive much attention speculate role protection HIE infant . However , despite biological plausibility encourage preliminary data animal adult human , surprisingly EPO never try newborn HIE even though already use neonate indication know safe .</detailed_description>
