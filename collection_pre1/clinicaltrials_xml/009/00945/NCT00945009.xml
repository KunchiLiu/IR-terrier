	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To improve 4-year event-free survival ( EFS ) 73 % young patient bilateral Wilms tumor ( BWT ) . II . To prevent complete removal least one kidney 50 % patient BWT use prenephrectomy 3-drug chemotherapy induction vincristine ( vincristine sulfate ) , dactinomycin , doxorubicin ( doxorubicin hydrochloride ) . III . To evaluate efficacy chemotherapy preserve renal unit child diffuse hyperplastic perilobar nephroblastomatosis ( DHPLN ) prevent Wilms tumor development . IV . To facilitate partial nephrectomy lieu nephrectomy 25 % child unilateral tumor aniridia , Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ( BWS ) , hemihypertrophy overgrowth syndrome , use prenephrectomy 2-drug chemotherapy induction vincristine dactinomycin . V. To 75 % patient BWT undergo definitive surgical treatment 12 week initiation chemotherapy . OUTLINE : PREOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive preoperative chemotherapy accord radiographic stage .
