	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine combination botulinum neurotoxin A rehabilitation therapy well botulinum neurotoxin A alone improvement function base Fugl-Meyer validated measure . Hypothesis : The combination botulinum neurotoxin A rehabilitation therapy produce good functional improvement botulinum neurotoxin A alone post-stroke upper limb spasticity measure Fugl-Meyer Assessment Sensorimotor Recovery Stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Botulinum Neurotoxin A With Rehabilitation Versus Botulinum Neurotoxin A Alone Treatment Post-stroke Spasticity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial multi-center , parallel design compare open label BoNT-A pair rehabilitation therapy ( OT ) versus BoNT-A alone patient diagnose post-stroke focal upper limb spasticity . Cohort 1 receive BoNT-A plus rehabilitation therapy duration study ( 2 injection BoNT-A ) Cohort 2 receive BoNT-A alone . The injection protocol closely follow design Allergan 191622-056 study inclusion rehabilitation therapy intervention . Those randomized BoNT-A alone able start new therapy exercise therapy study . Two type patient recruit study , naïve BoNT-A receive BoNT-A treatment spasticity . Given BoNT-A temporary effect , second group patient expect react differently patient naïve intervention . The site contact patient previously enrol 191622-008 , 025 056 protocol determine eligible involvement BoNT-A / rehabilitation study . In addition , sit recruit local community patient receive BoNT-A treatment spasticity place notice stroke club newsletter , contact local physician rehabilitation office , post flier area hospital . Patients screen eligibility interview study team member . Eligible patient complete informed consent process , sign consent form , HIPPA . A blind study physician perform physical examination focal exam affect limb obtain Modified Ashworth Scale score elbow , wrist , finger , thumb . Following baseline visit , appointment schedule next visit ( Study Visit 1 { Week 0 } , injection BoNT-A . Prior injection , , patient evaluate Therapist , blind treatment Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) Fugl-Meyer Assessment Sensorimotor Recovery Stroke ( Upper Extremity subsection ) . Participants receive IM injection BoNT-A 200 400 Units total dose exceed 6 U / kg . The primary target BoNT-A injection wrist finger flexor muscle ( flexor carpus radialis , flexor carpus ulnaris , flexor digitorum profundus , flexor digitorum superficialis ) . Additional target muscle include biceps , brachioradialis , brachialis , pronator quadratus , pronator teres , flexor pollicis brevis / opponens , adductor pollicis , flexor pollicis longus , lumbricales / interossei . The goal injection reduce spasticity cause event flexed elbow , pronate forearm , flexed wrist , thumb palm , clench fist , hand deformity . It necessary administer dose inject muscle injection visit . The treatment guide spasticity measure clinical judgment Investigator . All injection perform assistance EMG guidance muscle localization . Randomization either BoNT-A + rehab BoNT-A alone occur first injection . Randomization schedule determine sequential letter sealed envelope send site , generate independent analyst . Participants assign Cohort 1 ( determine randomization scheme ) also schedule weekly therapy appointment begin within 2 week injection . An attempt make study patient see therapist site effort make standardize therapy much possible . The evaluate therapist blind treatment assignment complete Fugl-Meyer upper extremity subsection every 6 week FIM week 1 final visit . Participants see every 6 week coordinator physician Study Visits 2 , 3/3A , 4 , 5 time follow assessment : Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) , , Patients ' Disability Carer Burden Rating Scale , Visual Analog Scale Disability Assessment Scale . The participant Cohort 2 follow injection assessment schedule ( include Fugl-Meyer upper extremity subsection every 6 week FIM week 1 final visit ) , participate therapy . If , visit 3 , participant ' upper limb spasticity reach MAS score 2 great wrist and/or finger , eligible second injection BoNT-A . Any subject meet re-injection criterion Visit 3 ( week 12 ) re-evaluated another 3 week , Visit 3A . If participant meet re-injection criterion Study Visit 3A ( week 15 ) receive another injection , follow Visit 5 ( final visit ) . If subject inject visit 3A , visit 4 occur 21 week ( 6 week 2nd injection ) . Visit 5 occur week 27 ( 12 week 2nd injection ) . Participants receive injection complete study sooner Study Visit 5 . The expected time recruit patient complete study 18 month . All participant query visit regard occurrence adverse event ( AE ) serious adverse event ( SAE ) . All unexpected AE SAEs review Site Principal Investigator report local IRB report Dr. Glenn Graham report VA Research &amp; Development Committee University New Mexico Health Science Center Human Research Review Committee . ( See Appendix I AE SAE definition ) . Study sit regular contact study participant whether receive weekly therapy .</detailed_description>
