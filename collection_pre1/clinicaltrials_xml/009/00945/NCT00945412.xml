	<brief_summary>The ultimate goal work establish method control bleed tonsillectomy awake child . Treatment post-tonsillectomy bleeding child typically require general anesthesia currently use electrocautery technique . Micropolysaccharide hemosphere technology unique absorbable agent help clot form . These hemospheres consist 100 % purified plant starch enhance natural clot concentrate blood solid platelet , red blood cell , blood protein particle surface form gel matrix . This device provide painless , non-irritating control bleeding , use effectively control nosebleed awake adult patient . This device , however , test tonsillar fossae child ; thus , study perform determine least 50 % child bleed tonsillar fossa spar rescue treatment electrocautery .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eligibility contingent presence follow characteristic : 1 . Children adolescents age 518 year old . The low age range choose order spare young , small child less circulating volume decrease potential unwarranted risk increase bleeding . The upper age range choose ultimate focus determine whether therapy help pediatric population prevent need electrocautery anesthesia tonsilrelated bleeding . 2 . Obstructive sleep disorder symptomatology require surgical intervention . The presence obstructive sleep disorder determine accord practice otolaryngologist investigator , include least two follow : medical history , physical exam finding , nasopharyngoscopy , lateral xray , sleep videotape , polysomnography . In addition , mean survey score OSD6 ( instrument validate child obstructive sleep disorder ( See Figure 2 ) ) least 3 , corresponds moderate degree symptom ( 0 symptom , 6 symptom could worse ) . 3 . Tonsillar adenotonsillar hypertrophy . Tonsillar hypertrophy define least 3+ tonsillar hypertrophy scale 1+ 4+ , follow definition grade obstruction determine visual inspection : 1+ 025 % , 2+ 2650 % , 3+ 5175 % , 4+ 76100 % . 4 . Bilateral microdebrider tonsillotomy . This method surgery chosen ( 1 ) standard technique utilized surgeon involve study treatment obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy ( 2 ) result relatively uniform , reproducible bleed surface require hemostasis follow tonsil removal . Eligibility contingent absence follow characteristic : 1 . Personal family history bleed diathesis easy bruising . The introduction confounder avoid , give primary outcome adequacy hemostasis . Given preoperative laboratory evaluation set suggestive history show low predictive value successful perioperative hemostasis , enrol subject receive preoperative laboratory screening . 2 . Intake nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug within 14 day prior surgery . Although several trial suggest postoperative administration drug may impact hemorrhage , topic remain controversial due large number subject require achieve adequate power study . Thus , introduction potential confounder avoid , give primary outcome adequacy hemostasis . 3 . Liver dysfunction . This disease state may also confound evaluation hemostasis . 4 . Cardiac , renal , blood pressure disorder . These state may make child less tolerant hemorrhage , exclude order minimize risk . 5 . Chronic inflammation state , recurrent pharyngitis , may result increased propensity toward bleed , thus subject potential confounder exclude . Children 3 acute pharyngitis episode within past year exclude . A pharyngitis episode define documentation physician episode &gt; 1 following : oral &gt; 38.3 degree C , lymphadenopathy &gt; 2cm tender lymphadenopathy , tonsil/pharyngeal exudate , group A beta hemolytic streptococcus positive , antibiotic administration proved/suspected streptococcal infection . 6 . Implant contraindication use monopolar electrocautery . Metal implant would preclude safe randomization electrocautery treatment arm . There suspected known contraindication application MPH tonsillar fossa . 7 . Allergic adverse reaction requisite perioperative medication . The current protocol call use antibiotic narcotic pain medication subject , one secondline agent plan alternative . Thus , inability tolerate penicillin macrolide antibiotic , oxycodone codeine narcotic , precludes entry trial . 8 . Children whose caregiver commit 2 week follow schedule . This schedule include daily call evaluate bleed pain control . 9 . Cognitive inability report bleeding , adverse event , pain control . Thus , child mental retardation , communication disorder , developmental delay , chronic pain state also exclude .</criteria>
