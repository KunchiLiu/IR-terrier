	<brief_summary>Breast cancer disease complex origin strong genetic component . The incidence breast cancer high monozygotic twin patient , think high proportion perhaps majority breast cancer arise small number genetically susceptible woman . Recent study human genetics discover several interval human genome contain inherit variant statistically associate propensity develop breast cancer . The investigator plan use knowledge design genetic screening test guide recommendation breast cancer screen mammography . If small group genetically susceptible woman identify , effective breast cancer screen strategy implement . In contrast , large proportion woman undergo yearly mammography exceptionally low risk genetic perspective . Using genomic guidance could eventually reconfigure efficacious strategy screen woman early detection breast cancer . By develop genetic screening panel base genetic marker breast cancer , investigator able accurately determine woman 's individual risk develop breast cancer .</brief_summary>
