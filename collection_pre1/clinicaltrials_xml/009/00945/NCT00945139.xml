	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test safety , tolerability , effectiveness two chemotherapy drug , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( Doxil ) bevacizumab ( Avastin ) . How Doxil metabolize excrete body also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Bevacizumab/Doxil Treatment Platinum-Resistant/Refractory Ovarian Cancer ( CA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Avastin : Avastin humanize monoclonal antibody ( type protein normally make immune system help defend body infection cancer ) . Avastin approve treatment colorectal cancer lung cancer . Avastin investigational treatment ovarian cancer approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use . Avastin think work attach protein call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) block action . VEGF play role formation normal abnormal blood vessel . It present normal tissue , produce excess solid cancer ( tumor ) . In cancer , VEGF help blood vessel bring nutrient tumor cell , allow tumor cell grow . In laboratory study human cancer cell grown animal , Avastin show prevent slow growth different type cancer cell block effect VEGF . Doxorubicin : Doxorubicin type antibiotic use cancer chemotherapy . It slow stops growth cancer . Doxorubicin approve FDA treat cancer head , neck , cervix , vagina , testis , prostate , uterus Ewing 's tumor .</detailed_description>
