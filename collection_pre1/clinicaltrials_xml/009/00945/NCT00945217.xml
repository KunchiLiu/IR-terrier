	<detailed_description>Atherogenic dyslipidemia characterize high level apolipoprotein B ( apoB ) -containing lipoprotein , include very-low-density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) remnants small , dense LDL ( sdLDL ) particle , reduce level high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) . Extensive evidence show atherogenic dyslipidemia contributes residual macrovascular risk also inflammation microvascular complication . The National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) recommend use non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( non-HDL-C ) surrogate atherogenic lipoproteins clinical practice . Elevated non-HDL-C may represent abnormal secretion , abnormal catabolism , and/or abnormal hepatic uptake triglyceride ( TG ) -rich lipoprotein . Recently , do pilot study study association SAH gene variant atherogenic dyslipidemia ( surrogated non-HDL-C ) postmenopausal woman . We find homozygosity SAH haplotype 3 associate increased adiposity , insulin resistance , elevate level non-HDL-C postmenopausal woman . Moreover , researcher identify least four member SAH gene family : SAH , MACS1 , MACS2 , MACS3 . All seem acyl-CoA synthetase activity toward medium-chain fatty acid cluster chromosome 16p12 . In present study , propose two-year study examine association SAH gene family atherogenic dyslipidemia postmenopausal woman . Based finding pilot study , plan expand cohort postmenopausal woman 800 woman , , recruit 660 new subject two year . The association non-HDL-C SAH gene family do 18 month study start . Fasting blood sample buffy coat lipid core test Study 2 . A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) available optional test well phenotyping insulin resistance participant . Detailed lipid profile include measurement VLDL cholesterol , VLDL-TG , remnant lipoprotein , LDL particle size , apoA1 , apoB , apoCIII do second year study significant association gene variant SAH gene family non-HDL-C detect .</detailed_description>
