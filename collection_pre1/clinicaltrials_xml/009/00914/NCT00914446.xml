	<brief_title>Identification Protective Worsening Steatohepatitis ( NASH ) Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent epidemiological study France show strong prevalence obesity ( 12,4 % ) strong increase 20 last year . Among multiple complication related obesity , hepatic complication ( steatosis steatohepatitis ( NASH ) ) among frequent . Our recent work show adipose tissue , follow example hepatic tissue also express CRP , hepcidin IL-6 gene protein level . We also notice 5 % patient spite obesity present normal liver without steatosis . The main aim work identify profile gene expression microarray liver might allow differentiate obese subject normal liver steatohepatitis steatosis . The gene study carry initially morbid obese subject without diabetes ( woman , index body mass &gt; 40 kg/m2 ) . We select sample 10 patient normal liver , 10 patient NASH 10 patient simple steatosis . These gene study carry liver visceral adipose tissue patient make possible evaluate interrelationship liver adipose tissue . We also include 10 patient overweight NASH ( study liver biopsy ) . The liver control ( 10 ) provide department surgery Pr Jean Gugenheim practically available . They `` healthy '' tissue near hepatic benign tumor . Commercial ARN ( Biosciences , Stratagene ) also use . After identification profile gene expression restrict number patient , validate profile gene expression significant number patient ( 30 45 patient NASH compare 30 45 patient simple steatosis ) . The secondary objective : To compare profile gene expression liver adipose visceral subcutaneous tissue morbid obese subject After identification group gene interest whose expression modify small number patient NASH , continue study restrict number gene . - To validate significant number patient modification expression gene approach real-time PCR - To determine site expression factor liver adipose tissue immunohistochemic analysis - To determine rate expression factor liver adipose tissue biochemical analysis ( Western blot ) - A serum dosage could finally carry determine serum protein could constitute predictive index NASH steatosis . We use series obese patient CHU Nice whose surgical approach obesity program . Preoperative exploration include clinico-biological assessment . During intervention , liver adipose tissue biopsy systematically realize research . We also use hepatic biopsy carry among patient overweight NASH . The feasibility work pose problem . The department surgery carry 10 surgery obesity per month . We already series 280 patient . We must include 150 patient order able obtain sufficiently patient normal liver . For patient , use tissue bank already carried patient already give consent . Finally must constitute liver tissue bank patient overweight . All fundamental technique control within team INSERM U 568 Awaited result : We could strategy select protective worsen factor steatohepatitis ( NASH ) able lead identify predictive biological marker lesion steatohepatitis thus identify patient risk hepatic lesion . These factor could also serve future therapeutic target .</detailed_description>
