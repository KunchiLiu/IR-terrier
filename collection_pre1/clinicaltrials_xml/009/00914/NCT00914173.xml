	<brief_title>Pain Monitoring Using Plurality Non-invasive Physiological Measurement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain unpleasant sensation , range slight discomfort intense suffering . However , since great extent pain subjective phenomenon , frequently defy objective , quantitative measurement . Traditionally , physician assess patient 's pain rely patient 's description . Self-description subjective definition ; often inaccurate , part difficult subject precisely articulate pain midst pain experience . Moreover , report might impossible subject communicate Presently , order quantify pain , care provider ask patient rate his/her pain intensity use one-dimensional scale usually score 0 10 . This scale know Numeric Pain Scale . This measure use care provider estimate correct treatment dose track treatment progress . Due impact care provider decision prescribe painkiller mediation , patient also intentionally misrepresent existence extent pain . Yet , without reliable basis deny prescription , physician generally must assume claim truthful , even may suspect lack sincerity . Otherwise , care provider may accuse inhumane treatment . Conversely , patient may underreport pain , variety reason . The presented clinical trial intend implement , validate performance evaluate efficacy pain monitoring device automate assessment patient 's pain level . During trial , 100 healthy young adult voluntarily inflict pain stimulus . The pain stimulus thermal heat pain stimulus cold water pain stimulus apply different intensity . Plurality Non-Invasive Physiological Measurements record volunteer Numeric Pain Scale report monitor , pain induction . Additional information age , gender , ethnicity , etc . collect well . The collected database use implement algorithm applies modern signal processing machine learn method order differentiate different pain level . The algorithm later integrated pain monitoring device . The efficacy algorithm pain monitor test compare result patient pain report towards give pain stimulus .</detailed_description>
