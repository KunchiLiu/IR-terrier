	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn development small gestational age ( SGA ) preterm infant whether focus infant 's behavior positive effect outcome . The study hypotheses state : 1 ) High risk severely SGA preterm infant profit detail neuropsychological assessment , psychoeducational recommendation practical guidance caregiving , well formal educational emotional support family professional care team . 2 ) Neuropsychological education guidance community-based early intervention provider care SGA preterm infant discharge effective promoting improve outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The preterm infant bear early also grow well womb double jeopardy developmental disability . The literature indicate fetus gain weight properly show expect head growth womb [ symmetrical intrauterine growth retardation ( IUGR ) small gestational age ( SGA ) status ] require significantly long stay newborn intensive care unit ( NICU ) grow poorly appropriately grown prematurely born infant , also show significant disability later term fine gross motor skill , cognitive function activity , language ability , abstract reasoning , concentration , attention , mood temperament . IUGR exert independent adverse effect developmental outcome preterm infant . Given importance last 4 month gestation first 2 year post term brain growth development , give relationship cerebral development behavior two-way street dynamic feedback system , particular vulnerability SGA child environmental factor indicate ground hypothesis appropriate support intervention severely SGA preterm infant family might ameliorate dysfunction . The general purpose propose project develop test model ameliorative neuropsychoeducational intervention NICU support developmental outcome severely SGA preterm infant family . The specific hypothesis test follow : 1 . High risk severely SGA preterm infant care NICU support neuropsychoeducational model intervention show : 1 . At 2 week post term , well-regulated autonomic , motor , state organizational attentional functioning 2 . At 9 24 month post term : - More well-regulated autonomic visceral functioning less colic improve eating pattern weight gain - More well-regulated motor system performance - More well-regulated state organization , include sleep awake organization - More well-regulated cognitive attentional functioning various domain , include visual-motor integration , spatial planning , attentional planning , expressive receptive language function , abstract verbal reasoning , short term memory continuous performance regulation - More well-regulated executive function capacities - More well-regulated affective emotional functioning 2 . Parents whose infant receive support neuropsychoeducational model care show : 1 . At 2 week , 9 24 month post term , enhance appreciation infant individual 2 . At 9 24 month post term , sensitively attune input support child 's functioning , competent parenting strategy , great sense effectiveness parent child . The population consist severely small gestational age preterm infant admit NICU randomly assign control experimental group . Effectiveness experimental treatment experimental group test three systematic outcome point various domain . The domain assess include ( 1 ) medical outcome ; ( 2 ) neurobehavioral outcome ; ( 3 ) neuroelectrophysiological outcome ; ( 4 ) family outcome . The outcome point infant family 2 week , 9 24 month expect due date . The study expect demonstrate intervention effectiveness improve IUGR preterm infant ' neurodevelopment . It anticipate result set stage model caregiving intervention life mandate every child entitle environment , care education appropriate specific need . The model use nursery provide improve outcome preterm population .</detailed_description>
