	<brief_summary>There laboratory evidence cholesterol lower medication ( statin ) inhibit growth breast cancer cell . Clinical study controversial show woman take statin less likely get breast cancer . This ongoing randomized trial compare one-year atorvastatin ( Lipitorâ„¢ ) placebo lower mammography-defined breast density surrogate marker associate breast cancer risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Statins Breast Cancer Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project design evaluate effect specific statin ( atorvastatin ) several breast cancer biomarkers . One hundred woman treat one year either 40 mg atorvastatin placebo . The primary aim project determine effect atorvastatin breast density , know risk factor breast cancer . In addition , affect atorvastatin serum biomarkers ( IGF1 ) tissue biomarkers ( atypia Ki67 ) associate risk evaluate . Because tolerability safety , statins great potential breast cancer preventative agent . Should pilot study show significant decrease breast density and/or change serum tissue biomarkers statin treated patient data would use support large randomize trial . This multi-center , prospective , randomized placebo control clinical trial . Target enrollment 100 woman , 50 receive atorvastatin 50 receive similar appear placebo tablet . Eligible woman must least 35 year old regular menstrual cycle Gail Model risk great 1.66 % 5 year .</detailed_description>
