	<detailed_description>The propose research provide important insight two serious problem veteran ' healthcare : 1 ) mixed effectiveness communication improvement intervention VA date , 2 ) persistence racial/ethnic disparity VA healthcare . We identify 4 `` best act '' physician communication patient believe important clinical interaction . We propose develop evaluate physician communication intervention focus specifically act . In addition , abundance pilot study data patient various races/ethnicities enable u create intervention applicable communication span patient race/ethnicity . Evaluating intervention physician patient 2 independent VA primary care setting help determine whether patient-driven communication focus incorporate input patient varied race/ethnicity help `` close gap '' health outcome white minority veteran . We aim ( 1 ) demonstrate efficacy use `` best act '' physician communication content intervention improve physician communication skill overall reduce variation communication white versus racial/ethnic minority patient , ( 2 ) ass impact patient experience `` best act '' patient ' perceptual behavioral outcome . We collect data 200 primary care patient view video physician interact clinic visit . From data , develop educational intervention physician focus specifically 4 `` best act '' identify . Scripts 4 `` best act '' develop , standardized patient Baylor College Medicine perform act , video record . We conduct 2-site longitudinal observational study 16 primary care physician ( 8 site ) 36 patient physician . At first site 3-month interval , physician attend instruction session consist view video one best act participate group discussion , role-playing re-enactment act , formulation bulleted `` take-away '' point facilitate subsequent recall . Once complete , sequence session occur second site . At site , clinical interaction participate physician patient audio record , audio recording analyze frequency occurrence 4 `` best act . '' After study visit , patient complete validate survey measure patient ' perception physician 4 affective dimension know impact patient ' subsequent perceptual behavioral outcome . Efficacy assess across patient demographic .</detailed_description>
