	<brief_title>Lung Function Testing Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To obtain distribution DLCO , FVC , FEV_1 pulmonary function test ( PFT ) patient heavily pretreated locally advanced metastatic solid tumor refer Karmanos Cancer Institute ( KCI ) Phase I Clinical Trials Program . - To estimate mean DLCO within 4 unit ( % predict ) true mean 95 % confidence . Secondary - To estimate percentage patient meet defined eligibility criterion ( include PFT level , especially DLCO ) entire population enrol KCI Phase I Clinical Trials Program . OUTLINE : Patients undergo pulmonary function test comprise spirometry test , lung volume , DLCO measurement utilize single-breath breath-holding technique . Patients proceed treatment phase I clinical trial .</detailed_description>
