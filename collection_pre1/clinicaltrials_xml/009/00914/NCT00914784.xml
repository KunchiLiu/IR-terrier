	<brief_summary>Currently Transfusion-related acute lung injury ( TRALI ) lead cause transfusion-related mortality United States , one major post-transfusion complication . TRALI define new ALI occur within 6 hour onset transfusion . It manifest acute dyspnea , hypoxemia bilateral infiltrates chest radiograph . TRALI may cause blood product dose-dependent . Associated risk factor include prolonged storage blood product underlying condition severe IHD hematologic malignancy active infection . Since TRALI recently define clinical entity , prevalence largely underestimated - epidemiology TRALI well established . Therefore objective work study incidence TRALI patient population receive blood product frequently , namely orthopedic-oncologic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Incidence TRALI Patients Undergoing Orthopedic-Oncology Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The transfusion blood product occasionally complicate acute lung injury ( ALI ) , progress acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . Such transfusion-related acute lung injury , abbreviate TRALI , define National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) work group , Canadian consensus conference ( CCC ) , new ALI occur within six hour transfusion [ 1-2 ] . This definition base entirely clinical radiological criterion include [ 2-4 ] : 1 . ALI , define [ 4 ] : A . The sudden onset respiratory distress symptom ( dyspnea ) . B. Hypoxemia : define ratio partial pressure arterial oxygen fraction inspire oxygen ( PaO2/FiO2 ) 300mmHg , oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) 90 % room air , clinical evidence hypoxemia C. Bilateral infiltrate frontal chest X-ray , without cardiomegaly . D. No clinical evidence leave atrial hypertension ( congestive heart disease ) . 2 . No preexist ALI transfusion . 3 . During within 6 hr transfusion blood product . 4 . No temporal relationship alternative risk factor ALI . All type blood product associate TRALI , however , plasma-rich component , fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) , whole blood , pack red blood cell ( PC ) platelet , frequently implicate [ 3 , 5-10 ] . Prolonged storage transfuse product , use FFP , presence underlying condition recent surgery , cytokine treatment , thrombocytopenia , massive blood transfusion , hematologic malignancy cardiovascular disease require cardiopulmonary bypass ( CABG ) surgery , active infection report risk factor development TRALI [ 11-18 ] . The pathogenesis TRALI involve presence anti-leukocyte antibody and/or biologically active lipid cell membrane fragment ( cytokine ) donor 's blood , trigger inflammatory response within recipient 's pulmonary microvasculature , turn lead lung injury [ 2,13,16,19-27 ] . The incidence TRALI well establish [ 28 ] . Nevertheless , use NHLBI/CCC definition TRALI , several retrospective study report incidence TRALI one case every 1000-2400 unit transfuse [ 29-30 ] . This incidence estimate 0.04 % 0.1 % ( 0.85 % among transfused patient ) comparable estimate earlier study use old case definition [ 6,12,31 ] . The prospective cohort clinical surveillance study use current diagnostic guideline TRALI report 8 % incidence TRALI intensive care unit ( ICU ) [ 32 ] . These data suggest passive reporting system greatly under-estimate number TRALI case . Even though underdiagnosed , TRALI currently lead cause transfusion-related mortality United States [ 1,7,11 ] . The estimated mortality rate recognize TRALI 5 % -8 % [ 20 ] . However , survivor recover completely appropriate supportive care receive additional blood product future [ 11,20 ] . Due lack epidemiology , increase significance TRALI major transfusion-associated complication , stress need additional prospective surveillance study . Taken together , wish conduct prospective observative study order evaluate incidence TRALI among patient undergo elective orthopedic-oncology procedure . This patient ' population receives blood product transfusion frequently , may thus provide adequate cohort study . Study Objectives This work aim study prevalence TRALI-associated morbidity mortality patient undergoing elective orthopedic-oncology procedure , transfuse blood product perioperative period . In addition , wish evaluate whether : A.The incidence TRALI high patient operated malignancy ( versus benign neoplasm ) B.The incidence TRALI high patient treat C.chemotherapy/radiation prior surgery ( versus non-treated ) The incidence TRALI increase old blood product Methods Study design An informed consent obtain orthopedic-oncology patient schedule elective surgery , except require minor procedure ( e.g. , biopsy ) normally require transfusion . Diuretics oral hypoglycemics discontinue day prior surgery , dictate routine patient . Peri-operative management Anesthetic surgical management well blood product transfusion adhere standard practice . Postoperatively , patient transfer post-anaesthesia care unit later orthopedic-oncology department , unless otherwise indicate . In postoperative period , departmental routine guide blood product transfusion , pain management fluid therapy . Monitoring patient receive transfusion Every patient receive blood product include study , whether occurred pre-operatively , intra-operatively post-operatively long hospitalize . For patient document : A.General demographic , include chronic disease , medication treatment ( e.g. , chemotherapy/radiotherapy ) . B.Blood product information , include type , dosage storage age . C.Intra- post-operative data , include operative time , volume crystalloids ( colloid ) give surgery afterwards , urine output , need vasopressor , inotropes diuretic , re-intubations , transfer ICU hospital length stay ( LOS ) . For unit blood product transfuse , commence patient monitor next 6 hour . If several unit give sequel monitor patient since begin first transfusion 6 hour last transfusion . Monitoring include : 1 . Clinical symptom dyspnea . 2 . PaO2/FiO2 , SpO2 room air arterial line obtainable - every 2 hour indicate clinical sign . 2.1 . If PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 300mmHg , SpO2 &lt; 90 % room air , clinical sign lung injury occur - chest X-ray obtain diagnose two radiologist . 3 . Hb ( gr/dl ) assess accord physician 's decision . Study size In orthopedic-oncology department Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center approximately 550 patient operate annually , 20 % receive transfusion . Accordingly , study plan 5 year . Therefore anticipated sample size approximately 550 patient .</detailed_description>
