	<brief_summary>After resolution initial episode hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) , lactulose routinely continue indefinitely maintenance therapy . Although widely use indication , lactulose never show randomize , control trial effective preventing exacerbation HE . Indeed , lactulose find ineffective preventing HE administer prophylactically patient undergo portosystemic shunt insertion . While patient may lactulose dependent follow initial episode HE , likely could lactulose discontinued adverse consequence . This goal worth pursue lactulose innocuous . It unpleasant taste , routinely produce gastrointestinal symptom , include bloating , gas diarrhea . In high dos cause incontinence , dehydration electrolyte derangement . Patients universally dislike take lactulose often noncompliant treatment . A recent trial show patient lactulose substantial risk hospital admission due lactulose-related complication treatment non-compliance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Controlled Lactulose Withdrawal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In pilot study propose perform control lactulose withdrawal select patient HE whose initial presentation follow clearly define , reversible precipitate event stable , chronic HE . We hypothesize majority patient withdraw daily lactulose therapy without deterioration cognitive function , lactulose withdrawal improve symptom quality life individual . We propose carry comprehensive battery clinical , laboratory , microbiological psychometric evaluation lactulose withdrawal . We closely follow change cognitive function re-institute lactulose therapy first sign clinical deterioration . Through multivariate analysis propose develop model discriminate treatment dependent treatment independent patient .</detailed_description>
