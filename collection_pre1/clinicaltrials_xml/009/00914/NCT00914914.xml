	<brief_title>Safety Study Cell Penetrating Peptide ( p28 ) Treat Solid Tumors That Resist Standard Methods Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug use study p28 , cancer cell kill peptide . A peptide compound make amino acid , substance body us make protein . The p28 peptide create protein call azurin . Azurin create common disease-causing bacteria name Pseudomonas Aeruginosa . p28 experimental yet test human approve FDA use cancer subject . Up 30 subject may enrol order find 15 subject qualify study . Subjects enrol group three , start one five progressively high dosage group . The first group three subject receive low dose p28 three time week inject vein four week . They monitor two week . If bad side effect record , initial three subject receive second ( high ) dose level p28 three time week another four week , follow , , two week follow . Additionally , three new subject add study receive p28 schedule , although second group start second dose level . In manner , 3 new subject add every six week start treatment dose level previously enrol group progress . Subjects monitor weekly first six week every two week remainder study . Monitoring include physical exam , blood test , EKG , appropriate radiographic imaging ( CT , MRI , PET scan , and/or chest X-ray ) . The entire study take 32 week subject start dose 1 , 26 week subject start dose 2 , 20 week subject start dose 3 , 14 week subject start dose 4 , 8 week subject start dose 5 ( additional 2 week follow-up period end study subject include figure ) . All survive subject however , follow accord normal follow-up schedule subject UIC Oncology Center .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients must histologically prove solid tumor disease documentation measurable metastatic disease define RECIST . The term refractory solid tumor signifies patient metastatic solid tumor fail standard therapy standard therapy exist . In patient refractory solid tumor , pretreatment biopsy ( either original primary metastatic deposit ) must show p53 ( wildtype extent mutant ) expression mean immunocytochemistry . Patients must distant metastasis unresectable local disease , project life expectancy least 6 month . Patients must sign informed consent . This study confine adult sex , age 18 old . Patients must medical problem would pose undue risk would limit full compliance study . A minimum 4 week must elapse since completion prior therapy , include hormonal therapy , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor monoclonal antibody . Adequate baseline organ function assess follow laboratory value within 30 day prior study entry : Granulocyte count &gt; 1,500/mm3 , hematocrit &gt; 30 % , platelet &gt; 100,000/mm3 . Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 50ml/min . Adequate liver function SGOT , SGPT , LDH , alkaline phosphatase &lt; 3 x upper limit normal ; serum bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl . PT PTT 1.5 time upper limit normal . Adequate cardiac pulmonary function . Patients decrease LVEF PFTs evaluate cardiologist pulmonary physician prior enrollment protocol . Patients undergo chemotherapy immunotherapy , i.e. , cytokine Patients refractory solid tumor whose primary tumor metastatic deposit express p53 ( null ) eligible . Patients serious additional illness , include HIV , hepatitis , untreated active infection . Patients underlying condition would contraindicate therapy study agent . Patients history prior malignancy past five year current problem he/she consider trial ( patient prior history basal cell carcinoma squamous cell skin cancer eligible ) . Patients serious medical , i.e. , cardiovascular , uncontrolled diabetes ( insulin resistant ) , psychiatric illness would prevent informed consent eligible participate study . Patients either pregnant lactating ( patient childbearing potential receive pregnancy test within 2 day study initiation ) . Brain Metastases , current past ( unless treat least one year prior enrollment ) .</criteria>
