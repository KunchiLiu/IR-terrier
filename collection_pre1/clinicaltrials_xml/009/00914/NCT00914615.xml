	<brief_summary>This study design see whether stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) reduce tumour size , slow progression disease , prolong life improve quality life . SBRT concentrate focused radiation therapy deliver precisely liver tumour . Presently , treatment unresectable liver metastasis colorectal cancer often chemotherapy novel targeted therapy . These treatment may improve survival , control metastases permanently ; new treatment need control metastases . It hop knowledge obtain study improve ability treat patient liver tumour treat surgery method , SBRT may prove treatment lead long-term permanent control liver tumours patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>From July 2003 May 2007 , 50 patient liver metastasis participate two study Princess Margaret Hospital ( PMH ) design determine safety treat liver metastasis SBRT . These study show SBRT deliver safely majority patient liver metastasis . The treated tumour control ( shrank remain size ) 74 % patient one year follow treatment . The median survival patient 16 month ( i.e.half patient survive longer half short 16 month ) . This survival rate well expect patient whose tumour grow big even though treated chemotherapy . Supportive care ( treatment care make feel good ) patient associated median survival rate 6-12 month . We expect benefit SBRT study similar observe initial study .</detailed_description>
