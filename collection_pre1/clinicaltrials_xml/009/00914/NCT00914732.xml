	<brief_summary>Due recent concern biowarfare bioterrorism , US government make effort improve ability protect citizen smallpox virus . This study evaluate safety IMVAMUNE® , investigational smallpox vaccine , ability stimulate immune system ( body 's defense system ) . Two vaccine preparation name one liquid one powder liquid add give . The vaccine come liquid injected ( give shot ) skin ( subcutaneously ) inject layer skin ( intradermally ) . The powder formulation inject skin . Approximately 495 adult , age 18 old born 1971 , smallpox vaccine , may participate study 7 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lyophilized IMVAMUNE® ( 1x10^8 TCID50 ) Versus Liquid IMVAMUNE® ( 1x10^8 TCID50 ) Administered Subcutaneously Lower Dose Liquid IMVAMUNE® ( 2x10^7 TCID50 ) Administered Intradermally</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smallpox declare officially eradicate World Health Assembly 1980 . Despite fact World Health Organization ( WHO ) officially declare smallpox eradicate , new threat exists due potential use variola virus agent biological warfare and/or bio-terrorism . Following event September 11 , 2001 Division Microbiology Infectious Diseases/National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases contract advance development IMVAMUNE® . Initially , lyophilized formulation manufacture , reconstitute 'at bedside ' prior administration clinical non-clinical setting . Due part potential requirement mass vaccination couple increased manufacturing time constrains associate lyophilization , decide transition liquid product formulation . Therefore , 2005 , clinical non-clinical effort focus largely liquid formulation , though non-clinical study lyophilize formulation continue . Presently , due potential need able stockpile Modified Vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) extend period time , renew interest lyophilize formulation . The purpose study compare safety immunogenicity lyophilize IMVAMUNE® [ 1x10^8 tissue culture infectious dose 50 ( TCID50 ) ] versus liquid formulation IMVAMUNE® ( 1x10^8 TCID50 ) administer subcutaneous ( SC ) route low dose liquid formulation IMVAMUNE® ( 2x10^7 TCID50 ) administer intradermal ( ID ) route healthy vaccinia-naïve individual . This study design randomize , non-placebo control , partially-blinded study ( liquid versus lyophilize formulation SC route Group B versus A ) . The study staff unblinded Group C. The study contain 3 arm : Group A [ Number ( N ) =165 ] receive 2 dose regimen IMVAMUNE® ( 1x10^8 TCID50/0.5 mL per dose ) lyophilize formulation SC route Day 0 28 . Group B ( N=165 ) receive 2 dose regimen IMVAMUNE® ( 1x10^8 TCID50/0.5 mL per dose ) liquid formulation SC route Day 0 28 . Group C ( N=165 ) receive 2 dose regimen IMVAMUNE® ( 2x10^7 TCID50/0.1 mL per dose ) liquid formulation ID route Day 0 28 . Safety measure assessment solicit local systemic reaction within 15 day vaccination ( Day 0-14 ) , unsolicited adverse event 28 day follow second vaccination ( 56 day follow initial vaccination subject fail receive second vaccination ) , serious adverse event six month post final vaccination . Immunogenicity test include assessment vaccinia-specific plaque reduction neutralize antibody titer ( PRNT ) enzyme link immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) mean geometric titer ( GMT ) base individual peak titer . For subject , peak PRNT ELISA define large titer among available measurement post second vaccination .</detailed_description>
