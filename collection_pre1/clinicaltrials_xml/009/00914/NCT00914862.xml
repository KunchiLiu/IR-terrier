	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Safety Ramelteon Between Adolescents With Insomnia Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ramelteon treatment insomnia approve use United States ( US ) July 2005 Philippines Indonesia 2008 . It currently development European Union ( EU ) Japan . Ramelteon market US ROZEREM® treatment insomnia characterize difficulty sleep onset patient 18 year age . In adolescent , form sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance insomnia , define psychophysiologic insomnia , similar adult , appropriate treatment pharmacological intervention compare insomnia child young 12 year age . In psychophysiologic insomnia , individual develops condition anxiety around difficulty fall stay asleep , lead heighten physiologic emotional arousal compromise ability sleep . In child age 12 , insomnia likely persistent identifiable consequence . In addition , less variability normative sleep data age group young child . Sleep disturbance also common child . Specifically , insomnia associate ADHD child common report prevalence 28 % medication-free child ADHD . This study characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) safety profile 4 8 mg dose ramelteon adolescent 12 17 year age ( prior 18th birthday ) insomnia characterize difficulty sleep initiation , pediatrics 6 11 year age insomnia associate ADHD . These profile compare healthy adult age 18 50 year match race gender receive 8 mg dose ramelteon . This open-label study design accordance recommendation FDA ICH guidances pediatric PK study .</detailed_description>
