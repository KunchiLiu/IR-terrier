	<brief_summary>Background : - HIV-positive men sex men ( MSM ) rate anal cancer approach cervical cancer woman . However , unlike cervical cancer , current recommend method screening could use detect anal precancerous lesion prevention anal cancer HIV-positive MSM . - Infections human papillomavirus ( HPV ) likely cause cervical anal precancer cancer . Detecting presence HPV relate biomarkers help identify woman may increase risk cervical cancer ; researcher believe early detection HPV relate biomarkers MSM may useful anal cancer screening . Objectives : - To evaluate effectiveness various test detect cancer-causing HPV HIV-positive men sex men . Eligibility : - HIV-positive MSM interested receive anal screening precancer Design : - HIV-positive MSM respond self-administered risk factor questionnaire , undergo physical exam high-resolution anoscopy participate clinic . - The clinician collect anal Pap specimen subject research HPV relate biomarkers . - Participants follow annually 2 year collect additional health data research follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive men sex men ( MSM ) risk anal cancer approach risk cervical cancer unscreened woman live develop country . There currently accept method screen HIV positive MSM anal precancer reduce morbidity mortality due anal cancer ; absence standard effective screening modality , clinic often resort anoscopy , diagnostic procedure akin colposcopy , direct biopsy HIV positive MSM . OBJECTIVE : Evaluate clinical performance detect carcinogenic human papillomavirus ( HPV ) DNA RNA , individual carcinogenic HPV genotype , cytogenetic marker , p16 ( INK4a ) Ki-67 immunocytochemistry staining , anal cytology , combination biomarkers identify HIV positive MSM prevalent , 1 year cumulative , 2 year cumulative anal precancer cancer ( histologically-confirmed great equal AIN3 ) use clinician-collected anal specimen baseline . ELIGIBILITY : HIV positive MSM seek anal cancer screening . Inclusion : 1 ) KPNC member ; 2 ) document HIV-positive status ; 3 ) able mentally competent provide write , informed consent . Exclusion : A current diagnosis anal cancer enrollment . DESIGN : To address need improve detection anal precancer cancer , propose screen cohort study 1,000 HIV positive MSM participate Kaiser Permanente Northern California ( KPNC ) health maintenance program . Under write , informed consent , participate KPNC member respond self-administered risk factor questionnaire undergo two anal specimen collection liquid-based cytology ( LBC ) medium prior digital exam high resolution anoscopy . Subjects ask self-collect home LBC buffer return specimen prepare return envelope evaluate utility self-collection anal cancer screen . Subjects follow annually two year collect follow-up clinical data relate outcome . Baseline clinician-collected specimen test masked fashion follow clinical biomarkers : 1 ) carcinogenic HPV DNA aggregate individual carcinogenic HPV genotype ; 2 ) carcinogenetic HPV RNA HPV16/18 RNA ; 3 ) cytogentic change ( 3q , 5p , 20q amplification ) ; 4 ) p16 ( INK4a ) Ki-67 immunocytochemical staining . For reference , clinician-collected specimen use make LBC slide evaluate expert cytopathology laboratory . We estimate clinical performance ( sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value , referral rate ) detection prevalently-detected , one-year cumulative , two-year cumulative histologically-confirmed anal precancer ( anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 ) worse ( great equal AIN3 ) . We test self-collected anal specimen best molecular test ( ) combination test detection prevalently-detected great equal AIN3 determine test clinician-collected specimen . All MSM undergo diagnostic procedure visit independent test result , result unbiased disease ascertainment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>2.1 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : Any male member KPNC 1 ) identify HIV positive Kaiser HIV registry , 2 ) 18 year old , provide write , informed consent , 3 ) currently diagnose anal cancer ( prior enrollment ) . 2.2 INCLUSION CRITERIA : HIVpositive men invite participate , regardless race ethnicity , describe meet eligibility criterion . Other diagnosed anal cancer prior enrollment , diseasebased exclusion . Because high fraction HIVpositive men fact MSM , prescreen men sexual orientation . 2.3 EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The exclusion criterion age less 18 , current diagnosis anal cancer render prior enrollment , unwillingness inability ( evident mental incapacity understand inform consent document ) give inform consent .</criteria>
