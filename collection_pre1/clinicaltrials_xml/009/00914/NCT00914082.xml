We hypothesize observed frequency epidural analgesia would 25 % intervention group , 35 % placebo effect group 40 % placebo group . According power calculation , include 328 participant hypnosis group , 328 participant active comparator group 152 participant control group obtain power 80 % ( α 0.05 ( two side ) ) detect difference 5 percentage point ( relative risk ( RR ) 0.71 ) intervention active comparator group . By include 152 participant control group would large power detect difference 15 percentage point ( RR 0.63 ) use epidural analgesia intervention control group . Because expect participant would develop medical condition require epidural analgesia delivery , give birth prior receive allocate intervention , give birth caesarean section , decide increase sample size 10 % group total 890 participant . In 2010 , study board experience 2009 general frequency epidural analgesia primipara give birth Aarhus University Hospital Skejby decrease 34 % .Therefore decide adjust sample size accord new information . When sample size adjust maintained sample ratio group hypothesize observed frequency epidural analgesia would 22 % intervention group , 30 % placebo effect group 32 % placebo group . To obtain power 80 % ( α 0.05 ( two side ) ) detect difference 8 percentage point ( RR 0.73 ) intervention active comparator group use epidural analgesia difference 10 percentage point ( RR 0.68 ) intervention control group include 446 participant hypnosis group , 446 participant active comparator group 226 participant control group , total 1097 participant . Again , increase sample size extra 10 % account woman would able comply allocate treatment obstetric condition reach sample size total 1208 . Analyses primarily perform `` intended treat '' .
