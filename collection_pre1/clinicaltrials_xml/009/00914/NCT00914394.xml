	<brief_summary>Autoregulation define ability vascular bed adapt vascular resistance change perfusion pressure . In eye , several study report retinal blood flow autoregulated wide range ocular perfusion pressure . Large scale study show reduced ocular perfusion pressure important risk factor prevalence , incidence progression primary open angle glaucoma . Former study investigate ocular blood flow autoregulation focus mainly choroidal blood flow . For optic nerve head data available , although seem likely underlies similar autoregulatory mechanism . A previous study investigate choroidal blood flow show nitric oxide ( NO ) play key role choroidal autoregulation . The present study design test hypothesis NO play role optic nerve head autoregulation increase intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . Therefore , IOP experimentally increase use suction cup device absence presence either nitric oxide synthase inhibitor ( L-NMMA ) , Î±-receptor agonist ( phenylephrine ) placebo . Optic nerve head blood flow continuously measured procedure .</brief_summary>
