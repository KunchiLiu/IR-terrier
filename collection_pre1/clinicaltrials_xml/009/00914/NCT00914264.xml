	<brief_summary>1 . The first objective study determine difference , airway obstruction severity , acute continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) effect chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient overlap syndrome compare COPD patient without term sleep quality , autonomic nerve activity , biologic marker systemic inflammatory , exercise performance . 2 . The second objective study evaluate subacute ( 3 month treatment ) CPAP effect COPD patient overlap syndrome term pulmonary hemodynamic right heart function , We also determine subacute effect CPAP sleep life quality , autonomic nerve activity , biologic marker systemic inflammatory , well exercise performance . 3 . The last objective study evaluate long term ( 12 month treatment ) CPAP effect COPD patient overlap syndrome . The un-scheduled clinic emergency department visiting , hospitalization , mortality record see significant treatment effect term reduce morbidity mortality . The long term CPAP effect sleep life quality , autonomic nerve activity , biologic marker systemic inflammatory , exercise performance , well pulmonary hemodynamic right heart function re-evaluation .</brief_summary>
