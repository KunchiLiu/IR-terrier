These infection may modulate immune system , affect replication HIV virus could result rapid HIV disease progression co-infected individual . Access practical , inexpensive easy use intervention prevent disease may effective delay HIV progression . Current Kenya government World Health Organization guideline recommend use cotrimoxazole ( trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [ TMP/SMX ] ) prevent co-infections , include malaria . Despite provision TMP/SMX HIV-infected adult , infection malaria pathogen cause diarrhea remain common cause morbidity mortality many resource-limited setting . In addition , TMP/SMX may prevent infection malaria pathogen due alternative mechanism action , antimicrobial resistance non-compliance due adverse event reason .

	<detailed_description>Introduction Background : Among estimate 22.5 million HIV infected individual sub-Saharan Africa , malaria diarrheal disease important cause morbidity mortality [ 1 ] . Preventive care package protect co-infections may result decreased HIV associate morbidity may also delay HIV disease progression [ 2 ] . Long lasting insecticidal net ( LLIN ) water purification system may practical effective intervention reduce malaria diarrheal disease incidence delay disease progression HIV infected individual . The World Health Organization currently recommend TMP/SMX prophylaxis immunocompromised HIV infected individual [ 3 ] . TMP/SMX active number pathogen cause morbidity mortality amongst HIV infected individual , include malaria infectious cause diarrhea [ 4 ] . Randomized clinical trial HIV infect child adult demonstrate mark survival benefit use TMP/SMX cotrimoxazole prophylaxis recommend people HIV Kenya Ministry Health guideline [ 5 ] . In addition , observational study suggest benefit marker HIV disease progression [ 5 , 6 ] . HIV infected individual increase risk malaria infection [ 7 ] . LLIN associate 17 % reduction mortality 50 % reduction uncomplicated malaria area stable malaria transmission HIV-uninfected adult cost-effective method malaria prevention [ 8 , 9 ] . In HIV infected individual , TMP/SMX prophylaxis show decrease episode malaria ~50/100 person-years ( p-yrs ) 9 episodes/100 p-yrs [ 10 ] . LLIN may provide additive benefit combine TMP/SMX HIV infected individual . Amongst HIV infect individual receive HAART TMP/SMX , addition LLIN result 42-60 % reduction incidence symptomatic malaria [ 10 ] . In HIV infect child receive TMP/SMX , LLIN associate marked decrease malarial parasitemia [ 11 ] . LLIN simple administer , require single encounter long term provision intervention , , contrast TMP/SMX , pose risk individual drug toxicity development resistant microbial flora . In addition malaria , diarrheal disease remain major cause morbidity mortality amongst HIV infect individual many part sub-Saharan Africa [ 12 , 13 ] . Limited access clean water drink food preparation result exposure numerous bacterial , viral parasitic agent diarrheal disease . Prophylaxis TMP/SMX show reduce diarrheal episode HIV infect adult 204 148 per 100 person-years [ 6 ] . Among HIV-infected adult , provision purify drinking water result 25 % reduction rate diarrhea per person year . The addition TMP-SMX cohort result 67 % reduction diarrheal episode , suggest additive benefit clean water TMP/SMX reduce diarrheal incidence among HIV infect individual [ 14 ] . Similar LLIN , water filtration device provide benefit prevent host ingestion pathogen free concern regard drug resistance toxicity . Water filtration device may require intensive use/training/compliance LLIN compliance daily use device may reduce effectiveness . It important determine provision LLIN simple microbiological water purification system able slow HIV progression reduce incidence malaria diarrheal disease give combination TMP/SMX . If beneficial , combination intervention may represent potentially inexpensive practical intervention include part optimize prevention package HIV-infected individual Africa . Justification Study : Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) dramatically improve life million individual . However , many HIV infect individual yet meet criterion ART initiation limit access HIV care treatment . In addition , ART expensive , difficult tolerate lead development resistant virus . Identifying inexpensive , practical safe intervention delay disease progression may allow HIV infected individual remain healthy long period require ART may reduce morbidity mortality due co-infections . To knowledge , study first look effect non-pharmacological intervention prevent infectious disease specifically mean delay HIV disease progression resource limit setting . Procedures : Adult men woman participate refer HIV Care Treatment Clinics include site offer eligibility screen . HIV seropositive individual document CD4 count ≥350 cells/mm3 consider potentially eligible . Those agree participate , willing able provide inform consent , WHO stage I II base clinical exam history ( Stage III base pulmonary TB complete 2 month first-line TB therapy ) , 18 year age old pregnant ( base urine beta-HCG test female ) offer participate study . Pregnancy test perform study visit ( every three month ) premenopausal woman . Women become pregnant course study continue follow . All invited participant require sign write informed consent prior enrollment . At enrollment , participant complete standardize questionnaire assess medical social history undergo complete physical examination . Blood specimen collect full blood count differential , malaria diagnostics , TMP/SMX drug level , measurement absolute CD4 count HIV RNA level . A detailed questionnaire also administer order ass socio-economic status , live condition , level education complete , sexual behavior occupation . This questionnaire also document potential exposure infectious disease water supply , sanitation facility , exposure mosquito use LLIN . In addition , detailed clinical history also collect document prior illness treatment relevant HIV co-infections . Detailed information regard location participant 's current residence additional residence consider primary dwelling also collect field worker site . Global positioning system ( GPS ) coordinate may collect location participant 's site primary residence facilitate patient trace . This information store well potential contact information available ( cell phone number ) order participant may trace purpose study . All enrol participant schedule three monthly study visit ( enrollment , month 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 24 ) clinic enrol . At follow visit , standardized questionnaire design assess change socio-demographic variable clinical history perform . A physical examination also perform visit . Blood collect visit determination asymptomatic malaria infection well marker infectious non-infectious disease marker . At month 6 , 12 , 18 24 visit , blood also collect measurement full blood count differential CD4 count . Measurement HIV RNA collect enrolment , 12 month visit 24 month visit . All blood separate plasma PBMC 's ( peripheral blood mononuclear cell ) store future study . Any future study utilize store specimen obtain approval Kenya Medical Research Institute University Washington Ethical Review Boards . Individuals evidence clinical malaria parasitemic treat follow standard Kenyan treatment guideline . Treatment provide study fund clinic accord Kenyan standard care . Asymptomatic patient instructed return clinic immediately fever develop repeat test . Study participant also encourage come study clinic sick schedule visit . During unscheduled visit illness , participant clinical feature malaria undergo rapid diagnostic test confirm malaria infection . Participants confirm clinical malaria rapid diagnostic testing refer free treatment recommend Kenya Ministry Health . In addition , blood drawn PCR , malaria thick thin smear unscheduled visit fever . Each participant visit declared residence two randomly determine time point per year course study period . All participant consent visit . Participants may consent participation without consent visit . Participants consent visit undergo random home visitation . For participant consent random visitation , field worker visit participant collect information relate use bednet water filtration device order ass compliance . Information household member recent illness malaria diarrhea obtain visit . During course 24 month follow period , individual expect meet criterion initiate ART base CD4 count clinical staging . All individual enrol study initiate ART provide detail information regard use ART , adherence tolerability . This aid clinical management individual provide additional data regard response ART group .</detailed_description>
