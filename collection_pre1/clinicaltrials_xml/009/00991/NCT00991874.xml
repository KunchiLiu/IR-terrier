	<brief_summary>Five percent child UK prescribe steroid inhaler control asthma symptom test determine whether dose steroid correct . Too much steroid treatment potential side effect little may lead asthma attack . Exhaled nitric oxide ( ENO ) gas present everyone 's breath may useful `` meter '' asthma control . In child , ENO measure easily quickly , result available immediately doctor nurse reason ENO attractive clinical test . Pioneering study use ENO help clinician treat asthmatic adult child result promise . Breathing test improve among asthma treatment guide ENO asthma symptom slightly less frequent . These study use single ENO value increase reduce treatment study author suggest range ENO value treatment neither increase reduce ; know ENO value may . Elevated NO associated number factor asthma , include allergy pollen exposure . What known factor asthma affect ENO measurement time . The propose study answer two important question : What value ENO indicate steroid treatment increase reduce ? And much ENO rise fall normally ? The investigator recruit 200 asthmatic non-asthmatic child . The investigator measure ENO six occasion 12-month period . The investigator measure factor may affect ENO asthma . For asthmatic child , investigator also assess asthma control . The investigator ' methodology base several year experience ENO . The investigator ' result allow ENO use monitor asthma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our hypothesis different ENO value correlate loss of/gain asthma control ENO variability relate environmental exposure include tobacco smoke pollen . Our research question : 1 . Do determine value % change ENO correlate gain loss asthma control 2 . To determine ENO measurement vary within individual 12-month period among child age 6-16 3 . To determine whether ENO measurement vary degree stable asthmatic , non-asthmatic atopic non-asthmatic non-atopic child 4 . To determine whether variability ENO correlate environmental exposure include tobacco smoke , pollen , domestic animal , mould ambient NO2 Background Asthma common chronic condition affect approximately one million child UK 5 % child UK prescribe inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) palliate asthma symptom . The 2008 British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guideline management asthma recommend step-wise approach treatment , i.e . treatment step symptom relapse remit . There definition severity duration symptom prompt step-up treatment . The guideline suggest `` trial error '' approach step treatment symptom-free individual . In 21st century , management asthma remain base highly subjective clinical decision press need biomarker guide asthma treatment . `` Priorities respiratory research UK '' recommend `` Rigorous evaluation need use new technology diagnostic monitoring purpose [ asthma ] , example exhale nitric oxide '' . A small number pioneer study seek use ENO guide asthma treatment , review recently lead applicant . These study find ENO-guided treatment associate improvement bronchial hyperresponsiveness , spirometry ENO . Although study find ENO-guided management associate improved symptom control , achieve significance one four population study . The dose ICS often considerably high individual treatment guide ENO . One possible reason lack improve symptom control despite increase ICS dose study use single cut-off value ENO step step ICS treatment ; situation treatment may step individual minimal/no symptom relatively small increase ENO . Use separate ENO value step step treatment may effective , recent study find change pair ENO measurement -40 % +30 % baseline indicate gain loss asthma control . Additionally , approximately 10 % individual high ENO airway eosinophilia subgroup , minor asthma symptom , ENO reduce ICS treatment . Whilst present literature suggest ENO promise biomarker asthma , finding date conflict question remain . In particular , still understood ( ) value ENO ( change ENO ) correspond loss gain asthma control ? ( ii ) variability ENO time independent asthma . Our study include rigorous clinical evaluation participant good statistical power ( weakness previous study ) . In proposed study take ENO measurement six occasion 12-month period well-phenotyped asthmatic , non-asthmatic atopic non-atopic non-asthmatic child . We describe change ENO context asthma control . We use result produce series cut-offs change ENO measurement child ; analogous traffic light green range ( little change ) , amber range ( slight increase ENO ) , red range ( significant increase ENO ) . This `` traffic light '' approach asthma management analogous current asthma management plan symptoms peak flow measurement use . We also report change ENO context atopy also environmental exposure include tobacco smoke , pollen , domestic animal , mould ambient nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) level . In future , collaboration colleague primary care , use range design clinical trial ENO use safely monitor asthma . Our data also make public could use colleague design study ENO use step-up step-down corticosteroid treatment asthmatic child . c ) Experimental design method Study design Protocol . Two hundred child age 6 10 year enrolment recruit local school . The initial assessment take place hospital remain five take place school . The follow include initial phenotyping assessment : height weight , standard respiratory questionnaire ( ISAAC ) , Child Asthma Control Test ( CACT ) asthmatic , ENO , spirometry , bronchodilator response skin prick reactivity . Longitudinal measurement ENO thereafter take two monthly interval . Asthmatic child complete CACT assessment change asthma medication also record . The defined primary end point change ENO assessment asthma control change . The defined secondary end point variability ENO 12 month . Eligibility . Children attend school Aberdeen city eligible . There long tradition Aberdonian school school child participate asthma study fortunate support Aberdeen City Council , headteachers , class teacher , parent child last 40 year . Our experience blanket distribution letter parent via class teacher result relatively poor enrolment rate . We therefore meet headteachers representative parent-teachers association explain purpose study , gain approval include article school parent bulletin approach parent child . Children age 6 year include since show ENO measurement obtain majority young age-group . Children unable provide ENO measurement initial assessment include future assessment . In event child severe asthma ( defined BTS/SIGN treatment step 3 4 ) recruit school first year study , enrich cohort severe asthmatic enrol hospital clinic . At start study , write consent obtain parent verbal assent obtain assessment child . Categorisation participant . Children asthma define affirmative response question `` you/your child ever asthma ? '' `` you/your child wheeze whistle chest last 12 month ? '' The number non-atopic asthmatic child ( ie asthma negative skin prick reactivity ) anticipate small ; final analysis , number non-atopic asthmatic sufficient , determine whether variability group differs atopic asthmatic . A stable asthmatic define asthmatic child CACT remain ≥19 treatment change one month . Questionnaires . At enrolment validate questionnaire use International Study Allergy Asthma Children complete . Parents primary school child ( aged≤11 year ) complete wheeze , rhinitis eczema module core questionnaire 6-7 year old . Children attend secondary school ( age &gt; 12 year ) complete wheeze , rhinitis eczema module core questionnaire 13-14 year old . Asthmatic child also complete CACT . A CACT score ≥19 define loss asthma control . A CACT score &lt; 16 used define good asthma control 79 % negative predictive value physician-defined uncontrolled asthma . Indoor NO2 exposure ascertain use question relate open gas fire hob home . Current cat dog exposure define affirmative response question `` Do currently cat home ? '' `` Do currently dog home ? '' Mould exposure determine response `` Is visible damp within home ? '' room ? '' Home define residence child spend week . ENO measurement . A portable NO analyser ( MINO® , Aerocrine , Sweden ) use measure ENO accordance manufacturer 's recommendation . The MINO® use school eliminate risk potential variability measurement analyser . Our group already validate use MINO® use child . The child ask inhale analyser exhale slowly , use visual auditory incentive , 50ml/s six second . In keep international guidelines11 , report mean ENO three measurement within 10 % two measurement within 5 % ; approach minimise inherent variability ENO measurement due analyser . Measurements take time day child , possible , eliminate possible diurnal variability ENO measurement . Exhaled measurement take child concurrent cold since may affect ENO result . Spirometry . Spirometry use phenotype study participant . A standard portable pneumotachograph ( ML3500 , MicroLab ) calibrate used accordance manufacturer 's recommendation , international recommendation follow . Each child complete three force expiratory manoeuvre , high FEV1 FVC value identify , FEV1 FEV1/FVC ratio record . Bronchodilator response . We measure FEV1 15 minute 200 micorg salbutaom ( mid/spacer ) . Skin Prick Reactivity . The skin prick test use determine reactivity cat dander , house dust mite , hen 's egg , tree pollen , timothy grass , dog dander , cat dander , Aspergillus Alterneria ( allergen provide ALK , Northampton ) . Positive ( histamine 10mg/ml ) negative control ( 0.9 % saline ) use . Atopy define least one wheal measure 2mm long diameter . Ambient NO2 concentration . Using Aberdeen NO2 diffusion tube network ass likely average weekly NO2 exposure child week measurement make . This supplemented assessment indoor NO2 exposure questionnaire data . Pollen exposure . This do look predictable seasonality pollen production , ie . Tree pollen March/April Grass pollen June/July . Pollen concentration measure Aberdeen concentration Dundee use frame reference provide cost ( £500 ) National Pollen Aerobiology Research Unit . The pollen season difference Aberdeen Dundee likely small insufficient affect time pollen exposure .</detailed_description>
