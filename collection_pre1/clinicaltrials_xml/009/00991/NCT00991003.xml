	<brief_title>A New Method Colorectal Cancer Screening : Colon Capsule Endoscopy Compared Conventional Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design This prospective , single center pilot analysis screen condition . Patient enrollment November 5 , 2007 , May 7 , 2008 . All patient provide write informed consent . Patients underwent CCE day 1 conventional colonoscopy day 2 , examination do different physician . Results blind examination complete interobserver evaluation finish . Patient acceptance assess questionnaire completion examination . This study approve ethic committee . The study partly fund Nycomed Fund University Hospital Basel , Switzerland Given Imaging Ltd. , Yoqneam , Israel ) . The author design study , gather analyzed data ; sponsor role design conduct study review approve data . Patients Men woman age 50 year without symptom ( Indication screen ) low gastrointestinal sign symptom individual young 50 year , minimum 18 year , without symptom positive family history colorectal cancer ( CRC ) ( Indication screen ) consider study . Exclusion criterion CRC patient 's history , cardiac pacemaker , contraindication sodium phosphate solution ( Colophos® ) risk factor capsule retention include surgical intestinal anastomosis , Crohn 's disease , diverticulitis radiologically suspect bowel obstruction . Data collection General characteristic patient assemble , include demographic , family history recent surgery , well bowel habit . Hypothesis , Aim End Points Significance define polyp &gt; 5mm size , hypothesis detection rate CCE correspond colonoscopy . The aim evaluate novel method ( colon capsule endoscopy ) performance screen tool compare conventional colonoscopy asymptomatic patient . The proclaimed benefit would increase acceptance screen colorectal cancer probable good detection rate adenoma resp . carcinoma . The primary endpoint number cancerous lesion polyp detect CCE compare conventional colonoscopy . Secondary endpoint completeness exam completeness , patient acceptance adherence preparation regimen . Colon preparation Propulsion Capsule For colon cleanse apply department 's standard preparation procedure conventional colonoscopy include diet Macrogolum ( PEG , Cololyt® ; Spirig Pharma , Egerkingen , Switzerland ) add oral motility agent , Phospho Soda ( Colophos® ; Spirig Pharma , Egerkingen , Switzerland ) -boosters rectal suppository promotes defecation , Table 1 . Patients start low residual diet three day prior PillCam® Colon examination . The following day require adhere liquid diet one day examination clear liquid diet . The evening examination ingest 2 litre Cololyt® 18:00 19:30 continue another 2 litre next morning 7:00 8:30 . At 11:00 give 2 tablet Domperidon ( Motilium® ; Janssen-Cilag AG , Baar , Switzerland ) 10mg couple minute prior PillCam® Colon capsule . Propulsion stomach small bowel verify use real time view give first Colophos® booster ( 45 ml ) . That later abandon ( remain 49 patient ) due satisfactory propulsion . If capsule excrete 17:00 ( 3 hour first dose ) second dose 30 ml Colophos® add . If still excrete 19:30 , suppository Bisacodylum 10 mg ( Prontolax® ; Streuli Pharma , Uznach , Switzerland ) administer . The patient remove electrode recorder-belt excretion capsule 22:00 , ever come first , continue clear liquid diet conventional colonoscopy perform following day . Pillcam Colon Capsule The PillCam® Colon Capsule 11mm x 31mm size ( Figure 1 ) . It equip two camera acquire picture end capsule rate 4 frame per second ( 2 picture per second camera ) . Compared PillCam® Small Bowel capsule optic optimize double area coverage depth view provide . The PillCam® Colon Capsule automatically activate removed package . It enter sleep mode order save energy approximately 10 minute start transmit 1 h 45 min later . It total operate time 8 - 10 hour . During examination patient wear sensor array attach abdominal skin data recorder storage information generate ingested capsule . After examination data download Given Imaging workstation video generate .</detailed_description>
