	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give irinotecan hydrochloride without alvocidib work treat patient advanced stomach gastroesophageal junction cancer remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Alvocidib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether irinotecan hydrochloride effective without alvocidib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Hydrochloride With Without Alvocidib Treating Patients With Advanced Stomach Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine antitumor efficacy irinotecan ( irinotecan hydrochloride ) follow flavopiridol ( alvocidib ) ( Arm A ) irinotecan alone ( Arm B ) patient advance gastric/ gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) adenocarcinoma wild type p53 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety toxicity study arm patient advance gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma . II . To examine measure antitumor activity study arm , include response rate ( patient measurable disease ) overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pre- post-treatment tumor biopsy p21 RAD51 homolog ( S. cerevisiae ) ( Rad51 ) expression patient agree tumor biopsy ( Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center [ MSKCC ] Weill-Cornell ) . II . To explore response irinotecan flavopiridol irinotecan alone deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) microarray technology pre- post-treatment tumor biopsy ( MSKCC Weill-Cornell ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute alvocidib IV 1 hour day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride Arm A . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
