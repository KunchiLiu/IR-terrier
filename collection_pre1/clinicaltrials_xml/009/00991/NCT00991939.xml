	<brief_summary>This study compare treatment 3 course high-dose dexamethasone versus treatment prednisone , patient recently diagnose immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) .

	<brief_title>Initial Treatment Patients With Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ITP common disorder associate significant morbidity . For 40 year recognize disorder responsive corticosteroid therapy . As corticosteroid easily obtainable inexpensive , become standard first-line therapy adult patient newly-diagnosed ITP . Generally , patient treat prednisone dose approximately 1 mg/kg , 60 mg/day , response obtain daily dosage gradually taper . While approximately 70 % patient treated manner respond initially , relapse corticosteroid dose lower ; ultimately 15-20 % patient achieve complete partial remission ITP `` acceptable '' dose prednisone . Recently , several study suggest use high dose corticosteroid , specifically pulse dexamethasone , may efficacious initial therapy ITP , capable cause high initial response rate significantly long duration remission despite short course initial therapy . This study compare treatment 3 course high-dose dexamethasone versus treatment prednisone , patient recently diagnose immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) . The primary hypothesis patient treat high-dose dexamethasone obtain durable remission patient treated standard oral corticosteroid . This may reflect ability high dose corticosteroid eradicate sensitive pathogenic lymphoid clone may transiently susceptible aggressive immunosuppressive therapy early course disease .</detailed_description>
