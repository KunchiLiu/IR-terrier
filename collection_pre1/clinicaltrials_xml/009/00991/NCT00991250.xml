	<brief_title>SentoClone® Compared Reference Treatment Advanced Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant melanoma one common cancer form worldwide WHO estimate 132,000 new case year . The incidence rate vary 150-fold different region ethnicity , high rate find emigrated Caucasian population ( e.g . Australia New Zealand ) . There therapy alternative advance malignant melanoma . At present , dacarbazine ( Dacarbazine Medac® ) commonly use therapy . Immunotherapy IL-2 IFN alternative , associate multiple side effect . Hence , remain considerable need alternative treatment . By use SentoClone® , autologous tumour-reactive lymphocyte expand infused patient , opportunity seek attack primary tumour metastasis . The first step identify tumour drain lymph node ( ) , do parallel surgical resection primary tumour metastasis . The sentinel and/or metinel node ( ) , initial meeting place tumour antigen immune system , dissect collect surgery . In study SentoClone® compare Dacarbazine Medac® Temodal® currently regard standard first-line therapy advance malignant melanoma .</detailed_description>
