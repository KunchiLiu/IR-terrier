	<brief_summary>Breast cancer common cause cancer death among woman . Yearly around 12,500 Dutch woman diagnose breast cancer 3,500 die disease . One problem lead strike effect refers late tumor detection due inadequate sensitivity current imaging technique . Current screen perform mean mammography , consist traditional film-screen mammogram digital mammogram . These digital mammogram offer digital enhancement aid interpretation , especially helpful woman dense breast tissue . Screening mammography nowadays single effective method early breast cancer detection . For screen high risk individual , increasingly magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technique emerge . However , none mention technique optimal sensitivity specificity , lead instance significant portion false positive result . The clinical consequence error additional test procedure perform woman may cancer . In United States , example , 11 % mammogram require additional evaluation ; lesion turn benign 90 % case [ 1 ] . False-positive reading False positive reading common young woman , test less specific breast cancer less common [ 2,3 ] . As result , follow-up procedure , include invasive procedure biopsy , do young woman even though few cancer find . Furthermore , breast cancer screen occurs repeatedly , risk false-positive study likely rise repeat screen [ 4 ] . Emerging adjunct mammography include ultrasonography , helpful assessment know area interest , magnetic resonance imaging . Image-guided biopsy - direct ultrasonography stereotactic mammography view - play critical role histological confirmation suspect breast cancer .</brief_summary>

Trial Design All patient undergo 89Zr-bevacizumab PET scan preoperatively day 4 follow tracer injection ( see : section 16 timetable ) . The uptake 89Zr-bevacizumab tumor quantify . Results fuse compare standard image technique standard tumor histology well specific tumor staining angiogenesis include VEGF staining . Sensitivity specificity compare conventional imaging . Study assessments 89Zr-bevacizumab PET image Radiolabelling bevacizumab Conjugation radiolabeling monoclonal antibody essentially perform described Verel et al ( 15 ) , minor adjustment regard purification . In short : FTP-N-sucDf-Fe ( kindly provide VU University Medical Center , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) conjugate mAb 10:1 molar ratio . Fe ( III ) subsequently remove excess EDTA ( Calbiochem , San Diego , California , USA ) 30 min 35°C antibody purify ultrafiltration ( Vivaspin-2 Centrifugal Concentrator , filter 30 kDa , Sartorius , Göttingen , Germany ) . This purify antibody either store -80°C immediately use radiolabelling . The conjugated antibody add 89Zr-oxalate ( 100-1000 MBq/mg mAb , kindly provide VU University Medical Center , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) , 0.9 % NaCl ( Braun Melsungen AG , Oss , The Netherlands ) , 2M Na2CO3 ( OPG Farma , Utrecht , The Netherlands ) 0.5M HEPES buffer ( Sigma-Aldrich , Zwijndrecht , The Netherlands ) . After 60 minute , radiolabeled antibody purified ultrafiltration Vivaspin-2 Centrifugal Concentrator , filter 30 kDa , Sartorius , Göttingen , Germany ) dilute 0.9 % NaCl/gentisic acid ( 5 mg/ml , Merck Schuchardt OHG , Hohenbrunn , Germany ) . The 89Zr isotope physical ½ 78 hour . 89Zr-bevacizumab radiochemical purity &gt; 95 % excellent long term stability human serum ( &gt; 1 week ) . Conjugation radiolabeling perform radiopharmacy facility department Nuclear Medicine Molecular Imaging GMP-conditions , responsibility hospital pharmacist . More detailed information regard 89Zr-bevacizumab find investigational medicinal medicinal product dossier ( IMPD ; appendix C ) . PET image Patients inject intravenously 37 MBq 89Zr-bevacizumab ( protein dose 5 mg ) day 0 . Subsequently , image make 4 day injection 89Zr-bevacizumab ( see section 16 timetable ) . For image Siemens PET/CT camera use . Recording perform 3D mode low thorax neck , approximately 2 bedpositions . The Department Nuclear Medicine Molecular Imaging certify accord ISO-NEN-9001 standard . Standard operate procedure dynamic scan use PET scan . Actual operation PET camera scan acquisition perform nuclear medicine technologist . Final image analysis perform nuclear medicine specialist . 89Zr-bevacizumab distribution score visually quantitatively . The majority patient also undergo sentinel node detection stag axilla surgical treatment primary tumor . For sentinel node procedure , 99mTechnetium label nanocolloid use . The anticipated time 89Zr-bevacizumab 99mTc-nanocolloid administration approximately 2 week . By , 7 half-life episode 89Zr radiolabel pass signal negligible . Therefore , interference radiolabel signal expect . Radiation dose/safety Use positron emit isotope mean exposure ionize radiation . Because potential hazard radiation , guideline exposure healthy volunteer specify `` Besluit Stralingsbescherming ( BS 2000 ) , artikel 64 - en Nota van Toelichting ( Staatsblad 2001 , 397 ) '' , refer guideline International Commission Radiological Protection ( ICRP ) . As kinetics antibody bevacizumab almost comparable trastuzumab , radiation dose 89Zr labelled bevacizumab expect range 89Zr-trastuzumab . For estimate radiation dose 'standard female ' 89Zr-trastuzumab scanning , use make available kinetic data previous 111In-trastuzumab planar imaging .
