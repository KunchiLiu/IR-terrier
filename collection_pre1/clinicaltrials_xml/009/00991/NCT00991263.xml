	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine whether subtype-specific treatment effect correlate disease-free survival ( DFS ) , determine significant interaction PAM50-based intrinsic subtypes , ( ) paclitaxel benefit CLB-9344 ( b ) dose density CALGB-9741 . - To determine whether subtype-specific treatment effect correlate DFS HER2-negative subset CALGB-9344 CALGB-9741 , determine analysis tissue microarray ( TMA ) slide . - To determine relationship PAM50-defined risk relapse ( ROR ) score DFS CALGB-9344 CALGB-9741 . - To evaluate relationship PAM50-defined ROR score DFS HER2-negative subset CALGB-9344 CALGB-9741 , determine analysis TMA slide . - To examine relationship PAM50-defined proliferation score DFS CALGB-9344 CALGB-9741 multivariate Cox-proportional hazard model include follow covariates : ( ) number positive lymph node , square root transformation ; ( b ) menopausal status ( pre versus peri/post ) ; CALGB-9344 ; c ) dose doxorubicin hydrochloride ( 60/75/90 mg/m^2 ) ; CALGB-9741 ; ( ) sequence treatment . Secondary - To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) Cox-proportional hazards-regression model test interaction ROR ( ) paclitaxel benefit CALGB-9344 ( b ) dose density CALGB-9741 . - To test significant interaction ROR paclitaxel benefit 5-year 10-year DFS . - To test whether 5-year 10-year DFS rate associate significant interaction proliferation score ( ) paclitaxel benefit CALGB-9344 ( b ) dose density CALGB-9741 . OUTLINE : Tissue block CALGB-9344 CALGB-9741 utilized purify RNA test PAM50 assay ( 50-gene quantitative PCR assay , provide intrinsic breast cancer subtype diagnosis ) generate risk relapse ( ROR ) score . The assay identifies five subtypes follow characteristic : - Luminal A : This subtype express estrogen receptor ( ER ) accompany high level ER-associated gene expression . Genes associate cell cycle activation highly express tumor type rarely HER2+ . This subgroup favorable prognosis enrich endocrine therapy responsive tumor . - Luminal B : This subtype express ER ER-associated gene expression lower extent . Genes associate cell cycle activation highly express tumor type HER2+ ( ~20 % ) HER2- thus , clinical perspective , Luminal B tumor least two subtypes define presence absence HER2-gene amplification . The prognosis unfavorable ( despite ER expression ) endocrine therapy responsiveness generally diminish . - Basal-like : This subtype ER- , almost always clinically HER2- express suite `` basal '' biomarkers . Genes associate cell cycle activation highly express . - HER2-enriched : This subtype ER- HER2+ majority case . Genes associate cell cycle activation highly express tumor poor outcome . Tumors within classification clinically HER2- fall class previously describe double-negative non-basal . - Normal-like : A tumor subtype diagnosis provide sample exhibit normal-like profile . Since profile train sample without cancer , `` normal-like '' implies tumor cell sample make true tumor subtype diagnosis . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 2,245 tissue block CALGB-9544 1,432 tissue block CALGB-9741 accrue study .</detailed_description>
