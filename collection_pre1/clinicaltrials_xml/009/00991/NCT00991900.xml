	<brief_summary>Adequate perfusion oxygenation essential function inner retina . Although well know fact , measurement oxygen saturation eye still delicate fully explore task . However , recently new instrument non-invasive measurement retinal vessel oxygen saturation introduce . Unfortunately , data reproducibility human yet available instrument . Consequently , current study seek evaluate short term day day reproducibility retinal vessel oxygenation healthy volunteer . 20 healthy volunteer include oxygen saturation retinal vessel determine . The reproducibility result test repeated measurement collect data independently analyze two observer .</brief_summary>
