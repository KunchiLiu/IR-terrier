	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate three different approach increase physical activity African American woman currently enough physical activity . One approach teach people physical activity , group , use general principle ( general physical activity program ) . The second approach teach people physical activity , group , use principle bible ( faith-based physical activity program ) . The third approach teach people physical activity give write material create National Institutes Health ( control group ) . Control group use research study see program study really effect physical activity . At end study , people control group also participate either general physical activity program faith-based physical activity program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The intervention conduct 24 church . Participating church recruit list church participate Health Ministry Institute , program include ~40 minority-serving church Forsyth County conduct Dr. Whitt-Glover 2 year ago . We enroll church list participate HMI church two-year period 24 church recruit randomization . If exhaust list HMI 24 church enrol study , place advertisement local newspaper send direct mailing ~210 minority-serving church Forsyth County , NC explain study invite send representative study information session learn . Eligible participant include 480 African American woman &gt; 18 year age report currently meet guideline regular moderate vigorous physical activity . Participants physical limitation disability would limit physical activity participation . In addition , participant contraindication increase daily physical activity , recent myocardial infarction congestive heart failure , willing participate two-year study . Participants active intervention participate 24 group session . Sessions 1 - 16 occur weekly , session 17 - 20 occur bi-weekly , session 21 - 24 occur monthly . Sessions schedule last 90 minute . This include 30-minute physical activity session ( lead train exercise leader ) 60 minute group discussion ( lead Community Health Worker train group facilitation , familiarity theology health ministry education , experience implement group-based activity faith setting ) . Group discussion content standardized ensure consistent delivery . Thirty-Minute Physical Activity Session . At begin weekly meeting immediately prior group discussion , participant engage standard 30-minute physical activity session lead trained exercise leader . The 30-minute physical activity session include warm-up , activity period , cool . Inclusion exercise period weekly session prove motivator on-time arrival weekly session pilot study , well opportunity participant learn method proper warm-up cool-down prior follow physical activity , well time rehearse use physical activity incentive ( e.g. , exercise tape , hand weight ) , understand body 's physiological reaction moderate-intensity physical activity ( i.e. , many participant pilot study exactly sure moderate-intensity physical activity felt like ( e.g. , hard breathing , heart rate ? ) may engage appropriate intensity-level physical activity outside class without opportunity rehearse activity class ) . Group-Based Intervention Sessions . The group discussion session lead Community Health Worker format similar group include five segment : 1 . Prayer/scripture check-in ( 5 minute ) . To ensure cultural appropriateness intervention session active arm intervention begin prayer reading assign scripture , end prayer , church-based activity begin end way . By deliberately write faith-based non-faith-based intervention , control amount spirituality naturally incorporate non-faith-based curriculum , limitation previous study compare faith- non-faith-based curriculum . 2. Review participant progress implement strategy recommend change physical activity previous session ( 10 minute ) . We use five-step approach continuous care problem-solving model segment . The underlying assumption problem normal part behavior change solution must tailor individual . The 5 step include : 1 ) problem orientation , 2 ) problem definition formulation , 3 ) generation alternative , 4 ) systematic decision making , 5 ) implementation verification . The group leader encourage participant openly describe progress achieve , identify problem might encounter . Good progress highlight strong positive feedback . Difficulties deal group support advice . 3 . Skill training ( 30 minute ) relate new content present session cognitive-behavioral self-management skill ( e.g. , goal setting , self-monitoring ) . Content deliver faith-based perspective incorporate biblical principle non-faith-based perspective include biblical principle . 4 . Goal set ( 10 minute ) . Participant ask identify specific behavioral goal next period receive feedback encouragement group . Participants compensate complete three round data collection . Participants miss schedule data collection visit contact two week miss visit attempt collect data . At minimum , participant ask report pedometer step ensure collection data related primary variable interest . Pedometer-Assessed Daily Walking . Daily walk measure use pedometer physical activity log record daily number step take study participant . Studies demonstrate feasibility pedometer objective measure physical activity potential motivator increase physical activity level . All participant receive New Lifestyle Pedometer 2000 ( NL-2000 ) begin study , ask keep record daily walk study log sheet throughout active intervention period . The NL-2000 also store walk data 7 day automatically reset begin day , reduce participant burden remember reset record pedometer data day , also increase likelihood able collect complete data walk participant . Participant log review , feedback provide , begin group session review participant progress . Participants measure walk use NL-2000 daily throughout active intervention phase . Accelerometer-Assessed Daily Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity . Participation daily bout moderate-to-vigorous physical activity assess use Actical Accelerometer ( MiniMitter Company , Inc , Bend , OR ) . Participants wear wrist-mounted accelerometer seven consecutive day ( one week ) baseline , 10 month , 22 month data collection visit . Several continuous variable may calculate accelerometer data , include total daily energy expenditure physical activity , total daily participation inactivity light- , moderate- , vigorous-intensity activity , average length bout activity give intensity level , adherence moderate- vigorous-intensity physical activity recommendation , adherence recommend bout length . Self-efficacy assess self-regulatory efficacy performance efficacy . A barrier self-efficacy scale employ mean evaluate key self-regulation process component social cognitive framework intervention , , problem solve necessary address barrier pursuit change lifestyle behavior . The physical activity measure 14-item scale predictive 6-month 1-year adherence physical activity .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>African American woman &gt; 18 year age report currently meet guideline regular moderate vigorous physical activity . No physical limitation disability would limit physical activity participation . No contraindication increase daily physical activity , recent myocardial infarction congestive heart failure , willing participate twoyear study . Individuals &lt; 18 year age ineligible participation . Those walk aid ( e.g. , walker , cane ) . Those may need additional medical clearance ( e.g. , severe obesity ) ask obtain clearance prior formal enrollment study .</criteria>
