	<brief_summary>Infection hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) cause liver scarring , cirrhosis , usually occur rapidly among people infect HCV human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . People infect HCV HIV poor response current HCV treatment . This phase II pilot study evaluate whether add new HCV medication improve response current standard HCV treatment pegylated interferon ribavirin people HCV HIV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) significant cause liver scarring , cirrhosis , account 30 % liver transplant United States . People infect HIV high risk coinfection HCV , combination two infection appear accelerate progression cirrhosis . Current treatment HCV infection include 48-week course two medication take together , peginterferon alfa-2a ( PEG ) ribavirin ( RBV ) . This combination effective 14 % 29 % people infected HIV HCV genotype 1 ( genotype common United States ) . Further complicate treatment , antiretrovirals ( use treat HIV ) HCV medication often high toxicity take together , limit dosing . Nitazoxanide ( NTZ ) medication currently approve treat intestinal infection investigate use treat HCV . NTZ side effect show increase effectiveness HCV treatment combine PEG RBV among HCV monoinfected people . This study test whether add NTZ PEG+RBV regimen people coinfected HCV HIV improve HCV treatment outcome . Participation study last 76 week . At study entry , participant complete brief physical exam , provide urine sample routine safety test , provide blood sample , complete pregnancy test . Participants initiated NTZ , take twice day food year . After 4 week NTZ , participant complete second study visit , complete assessment study entry ask medication take . At visit , participant initiate two study drug , PEG RBV . PEG deliver via injection weekly RBV take orally twice day dose dependent participant 's weight entry . Participants take NTZ , PEG RBV together 48 week . During time , participant complete study visit every 4 week Week 52 complete follow-up visit Weeks 64 76 . At visit , participant complete assessment previous visit , , certain week , also fast 8 hour blood draw . Additional blood sample collect stored Weeks 4 , 8 , 16 , 52 76 order future test . Participants achieve early virologic response study treatment ( least 2-log10 decrease HCV viral load undetectable HCV viral load Week 16 ) , detectable HCV viral load Week 28 ) , stop study treatment discontinue study early , 20 32 week , respectively .</detailed_description>
