	<brief_summary>The purpose investigation determine clinical outcome surgical reconstruction complete rupture posterior cruciate ligament ( PCL ) posterolateral structure knee joint . The outcome determine validate rigorous knee rating system 2 10 year postoperatively . The result determine analysis subjective functional factor , sport occupational activity level , comprehensive physical examination , radiographic evaluation . We hypothesize appropriately indicated procedure effectively restore normal knee stability function patient isolate combined injury structure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Outcome Posterior Cruciate Ligament ( PCL ) Posterolateral Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because injury PCL posterolateral structure occur less frequency structure knee joint ( anterior cruciate ligament meniscus ) , few study available assist surgeon patient appropriate decision-making regard conservative versus surgical treatment . The majority patient sustain injury structure treat conservatively . Unfortunately , several investigation describe noteworthy symptom functional limitation follow conservative management , high percentage patient develop knee osteoarthritis disable recreational daily activity . The investigator study nearly three decade experience extensively studied effect injury laboratory clinic setting . It opinion surgical reconstruction provide significant benefit appropriately indicate , demonstrate previous study . Especially athletic individual , PCL posterolateral reconstructive procedure advance point predictable result expect restore sufficient knee function . Studies demonstrate , least short-term , majority patient acute ligament rupture treat reconstruction able return various level sport activities.12 Whether procedure decrease risk patient develop future osteoarthritis unknown require study .</detailed_description>
