	<brief_summary>The development pneumonia infection one common complication traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Prior study also find patient suffer TBI also develop immune dysfunction consistent immunosuppressed state shortly traumatic event . Specifically , show patient TBI impair delay type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) , cellular immunity humoral immunity . The humoral arm immune system particularly involved defend host extracellular bacteria primarily compose B-cells , immunoglobulins complement . Surgery trauma impair clonal expansion antibody produce B lymphocytes cause hypogammaglobulinemia , mechanism involve T lymphocyte . In addition , systemic inflammatory process , pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , interleukin 1 ( IL-1beta ) interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) release . Nuclear factor kappa beta ( NF-kB ) transcriptional regulatory protein involve expression proinflammatory cytokine appear act critical step transcription many proinflammatory gene . The hypothesis study hypogammaglobulinemia immune dysfunction induction NF-kB inflammatory process , part , responsible development pneumonia infectious complication identify TBI . This study two specific aim : The primary specific aim study determine association serum immunoglobulin NF-kB level development pneumonia patient suffer traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . The secondary specific aim study determine relative contribution clinical variable APACHE II-III Score Injury Severity Score compare immunological variable ( serum immunoglobulins NF-kB ) development pneumonia patient suffer TBI .</brief_summary>
