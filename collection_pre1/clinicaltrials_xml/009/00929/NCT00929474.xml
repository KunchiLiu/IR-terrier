	<brief_summary>Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) show improvement mortality morbidity patient leave ventricular systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure . Additionally CRT patient demonstrate optimize paced/sensed atrioventricular ( AV ) interventricular ( V-V ) timing lead immediate hemodynamic benefit improve cardiac function . Recent study show optimal paced/sensed AV V-V delay change time , raise question often optimization repeat . Thus , frequent re-optimization delay might beneficial maintain significant improvement cardiac function . However , remain evaluated whether time optimization may beneficial patient receive CRT number year CRT device replace .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BOOST - Benefit Frequent Optimization After Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Device Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This prospective , randomize , multicenter study - Patients receive replacement St. Jude Medical ( SJM ) CRT device , either CRT-P CRT-D , within last two week post CRT replacement consider enrollment study . - Baseline measurement perform time enrollment . - Patients follow 12 month post CRT replacement data collect 3 , 6 , 9 12 month post CRT replacement . - Patients randomize enrollment either Group 1 ( use SJM algorithm optimize programming ) Group 2 ( `` Control '' ) .</detailed_description>
