	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate change insulin sensitivity ß-cell function 24 48 week low-dose growth hormone ( GH ) therapy adult patient severe GH deficiency use highly standardize technique . Insulin sensitivity estimate use euglycemic , hyperinsulinemic clamp , insulin secretion hepatic insulin clearance determine change insulin C-peptide level hyperglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp consecutive intravenous ( i.v . ) L-arginine stimulation test . Moreover , researcher investigate change body composition , lipolysis cardiovascular risk marker . Furthermore , order verify mechanism involve pathogenesis GH-induced insulin resistance GH-induced improvement insulin resistance long term treatment , researcher intend establish change intramyocellular lipid ( IMCL ) patient GH deficiency magnetic resonance ( MR ) -spectroscopy GH-treatment correlate IMCL insulin resistance , insulin secretion insulin clearance . Finally , researcher aim justify effect GH adiponectin secretion well 11-ß hydroxylase activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In adult patient GH deficiency , well document treatment recombinant human GH result reduction visceral fat mass increase muscle mass . During long-term treatment , effect seem beneficial effect glucose metabolism . However , initial phase GH treatment insulin antagonistic effect GH often induce insulin resistant state lead increase insulin secretion even , case preexist ß-cell defect , overt diabetes . Due lipolytic effect GH , impact GH treatment intracellular lipid homeostasis adipose tissue , also skeletal muscle cell liver cell expect . Moreover , since insulin resistance know closely correlated intramyocellular lipid ( IMCL ) content , change IMCL play key role GH-induced change insulin sensitivity . Anyway , mechanisms involved pathogenesis GH-induced insulin resistance GH-induced improvement insulin resistance long term treatment presently fully understood . In order verify mechanism , intend establish change IMCL patient GH deficiency MR-spectroscopy GH-treatment correlate IMCL insulin resistance , insulin secretion insulin clearance . Finally , aim justify effect GH adiponectin secretion well 11-ß hydroxylase activity .</detailed_description>
