	<brief_title>Anti-tuberculosis ( TB ) Drug Levels Hepatotoxicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) major health problem develop developed country resurgence immunosuppressed patient . World Health Organization ( WHO ) 1993 declare tuberculosis 'global emergency ' third world 's population infect . Globally 8.9 million new case tuberculosis occur annually , 1.8 million ( 20 % ) occur India . Short-course chemotherapy contain isoniazid ( INH ) , rifampicin ( RMP ) pyrazinamide ( PZA ) prove highly effective treatment tuberculosis . One adverse effect hepatotoxicity . It common side effect lead interruption therapy . It associate mortality 6-12 % drug continue even onset symptom . Risk hepatotoxicity increase drug combine . The time interval start anti-TB drug appearance hepatotoxicity vary 3 135 day . In case hepatitis evident within three month start antituberculosis treatment ( ATT ) . The pathogenesis drug-induced hepatotoxicity ( DIH ) still entirely clear anti TB drug include rifampicin . Hypersensitivity definite possibility Rifampicin induce hepatitis postulate occur part systemic allergic reaction , due unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia result competition bilirubin uptake hepatocyte plasma membrane . DIH cause rifampicin occur early compare isoniazid . While dose related toxicity may exist , direct correlation serum drug level hepatotoxicity well report . Thus clinical relevance therapeutic monitoring serum rifampicin concentration manage DIH still explore . Present study do observe serum rifampicin , isoniazid , pyrazinamide level patient ATT compare retrospectively patient develop drug induce hepatitis v .</detailed_description>
