	<brief_summary>Main goal clinical investigation investigate different cytokine wound fluid euthyroid vs. hypothyroid patient . As primary endpoint want evaluate different cytokine level euthyroid vs. hypothyroid patient exist extent cytokine differ . Our targeted cytokine : IL6 , IL10 , TNFa MCP-1 . From literature 4 factor seem reasonable measure focus . Additionally focus 4 factor financial reason , technically would n't problem measure , correlate high cost . Besides , 6 factor would mean large amount sample fluid need , would cause technical problem . These factor ` change direction . Secondarily , believe difference cytokine profile hypothyroidism vs. euthyroidism correlate difference duration clinical characteristic wound heal process .</brief_summary>
