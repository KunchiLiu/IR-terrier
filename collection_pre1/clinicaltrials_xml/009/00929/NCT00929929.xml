	<brief_title>Study Assess Effect Leucine Along With Resistance Exercise Muscle Strength Quality Life Elders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physiological age accompanied functional loss change different organ , include skeletal muscle , progressive reduction muscle mass . This call physiological sarcopenia elderly . In population autonomous individual 65 year , proportion 3 % 32 % depend age , meet criteria so-called Frailty Syndrome . Frailty characterize decrease reserve resistance aggression , confer increase vulnerability , disability poor vital prognosis . A feature Frailty Syndrome potential reversibility many element initial stage frailty . Currently , available treatment frailty limit . One tool prevention sarcopenia , nutritional treatment exercise vital role . Protein synthesis age muscle improve increase leucine concentration physiological level higher intake . Regarding exercise , progressive resistance train one intervention show well result increase mass muscle strength elderly people . The hypothesis raise possibility intervention consist leucine supplement along progressive resistance training , superior train program placebo improve muscle strength quality life elderly people .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Over 70 year age . Subjects capable resistance exercise . Hospitalized patient . Disabled patient ( i.e. , able exercise ) . Patients usually train resistance exercise .
