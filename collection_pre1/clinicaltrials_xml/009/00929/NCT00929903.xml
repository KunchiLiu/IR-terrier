	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Young Patients With Solid Tumors That Have Relapsed Not Responded Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate maximum-tolerated dose and/or recommend phase II dose pazopanib hydrochloride pediatric patient relapse refractory solid tumor . II . Define describe toxicity regimen patient . III . Characterize pharmacokinetics pazopanib hydrochloride patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Preliminarily define antitumor activity pazopanib hydrochloride within confines phase I study . II . Evaluate change tumor vascular permeability follow initiation pazopanib hydrochloride correlate change clinical outcome dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI . OUTLINE : This multicenter study dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients accrue maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) pazopanib hydrochloride determine receive pazopanib hydrochloride oral suspension . Some patient undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI baseline periodically study . Blood sample collect baseline periodically study pharmacokinetic study .</detailed_description>
