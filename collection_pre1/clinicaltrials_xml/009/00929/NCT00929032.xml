	<detailed_description>Introduction Liver cell call hepatocytes undertake important metabolic function liver . The liver also contain large number immune cell call Kupffer cell . These cell act filter remove bacteria dangerous substance blood passing liver . Although know understand great deal liver cell behave function transplant idea happen immune cell liver . These immune cell make 85 % total body reserve cell serve important function clear bacteria bacterial product blood . A failure cell associate risk infection . Infections , blood clot disorder many serious medical issue typical patient suffer chronic liver failure . This study use microscopic particle human protein call albumin form microspheres simulate bacteria blood . We detect microspheres attach radioactive label sphere measure emission detector call gamma counter . The level radiation quite small similar bone scan . We previously show healthy liver rapidly clear albumin microspheres blood . We also show previously major liver surgery delay clearance microspheres , believe equate poorly functioning innate immune system . Liver transplantation successful life-extending treatment patient chronic liver failure cirrhosis . During liver transplantation know proportion hepatocytes damage recover follow transplant . We want establish immediate particulate clearance capacity liver follow transplantation pattern recovery one week later . This used surrogate liver clearance bacteria bacterial product . We also intend measure production set protein call acute phase protein , produce liver may important help immune cell recognize bacteria . These protein , also call opsonin , bind wall bacteria make easy immune cell attach bacteria eat . We also want find difference non-marginal marginal liver graft reticuloendothelial clearance capacity . This study may provide important information regard need post-operative antibiotic prevention infection patient group . This research first kind address issue vulnerable group patient study ever look effect transplantation immune cell liver . This study investigate ability liver clear particle ( albumin microspheres ) blood monitor recover improvement function cell period time . Results pilot study A study also eLISTER group ( Edinburgh liver injury surgery transplantation experimental research ) effect major liver resection innate immunity bacterial endotoxin approve Lothian research Ethics Committee LREC/2002/1/31 . This trial perform May 2003 2005 . This study look adaptive response reticuloendothelial system major liver resection . We find strong correlation clearance albumin microspheres ICG ( indocyanine green clearance ) , support assertion hepatocellular function RES phagocytosis relate term liver volume . We also demonstrate marked defect RES phagocytosis patient chronic liver disease normal liver function , undergone major liver resection . Validation technique measurement phagocytic clearance Tc-99m label ( NanocollÂ® ) microaggregated human albumin To determine reticuloendothelial system ( RES ) phagocytosis activity liver phagocytic function respectively measure plasma clearance 99mTc label micro-aggregated human albumin without image study . It show several study reliable method estimate RES phagocytosis activity . By measure plasma radioactivity disappearance rate instead image study radioactivity dose less 15 MBq sufficient determine 99mTc plasma clearance accurately . Disappearance 99mTc blood activity measure serially 3-minutes interval 30 minute , 10-minutes interval 60 minute 20-minutes interval 120 minute . Three half-life time require 99mTc albumin microspheres count rate fall 100 % 50 % , 50 % 25 % 25 % 12.5 % value obtain three minute injection note mean half-life standard deviation , express microspheres blood clearance , calculate . To determine possibly non-linear nature albumin microspheres clearance time area curve calculate observation time use integral function . Mean half-life albumin microspheres blood area curve day 1 day 7 transplantation express percentage preoperative value compare individual patient group . We hypothesize phagocytosis activity marginal compare good liver graft significantly impair liver transplantation due decrease number phagocyte well due decrease synthesis substance usually facilitate phagocytosis . If hypothesis true , RES phagocytosis activity marginal graft significantly increase liver transplantation comparable RES phagocytosis activity non-marginal graft . Aims This project test hypothesis liver transplantation normal marginal graft result significant impairment innate immunity bacterial endotoxin . We intend characterise nature reticuloendothelial clearance impairment follow liver transplantation recovery marginal non-marginal graft . We also wish correlate clearance capacity measure hepatocyte injury ( ALT/AST ) liver dysfunction score establish whether two process independent related . In regard compare marginal non-marginal organ relationship reticuloendothelial cell dysfunction cold ischemic time . Reticuloendothelial clearance capacity also relate evidence clinical infection postoperative course . Research question - Hypotheses I. Liver transplantation result significant impairment innate immunity bacterial endotoxin . II . The degree impairment innate immunity endotoxin directly relate functional status liver graft . ( Patients undergo liver transplantation non-marginal marginal graft compare ) . III . To establish whether correlation liver cell ( hepatocyte ) injury immune cell ( Kupffer cell ) injury transplantation . IV . To establish effect liver transplantation serum expression acute phase protein opsonins .</detailed_description>
