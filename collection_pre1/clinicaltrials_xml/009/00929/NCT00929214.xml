	<brief_title>Aggressive Local Therapy Limited Bone-only Metastasis Improve Progression-Free Survival Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Treatments : Current standard care breast cancer patient whose disease spread bone treat chemotherapy endocrine therapy . However , use radiation surgery well may help get rid cancer cell bone lesion . All participant receive separate consent document sign explain routine surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy . Standard Therapy : If image scan show increase risk bone fracture , receive 3 9 month systemic therapy appropriate decide doctor . You may also place endocrine therapy decide doctor . If receive drug past could cause heart-related side effect and/or history heart disease , may heart function test , cancer doctor decide need . Study Visits : After receive 3-9 month standard therapy , receive MRI scan , PET/CT scan , X-ray , whole-body bone scan make sure still 3 bone metastasis . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine test also collect make sure 3 bone metastasis . Local Therapy : If still 3 bone metastasis , local treatment include high-dose radiation therapy and/or surgery give . The appropriate local therapy chosen treat radiation oncologist , surgeon , medical oncologist . For bone fracture risk fracture , rod device may place bone fix bone . Radiation therapy involve daily treatment weekday may last 5 7 week row . Each daily treatment may last 30 - 40 minute . For special case , shorter course radiation therapy may offer treat lesion spine . Radiation type , photon , electron , proton select doctor . If risk bone fracture due cancer , may treat surgery and/or radiation first , start standard therapy . Again , appropriate local therapy chosen treat radiation oncologist , surgeon , medical oncologist . After complete local therapy , receive MRI scan , PET/CT scan , X-ray , whole-body bone scan make sure still 3 bone metastasis . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine also collect make sure 3 bone metastasis . Then , receive 3 9 month systemic therapy appropriate decide doctor . You may also place endocrine therapy decide doctor . Length Study : The standard systemic therapy treatment may last 3 9 month . The radiation therapy process may last 6 8 week . Surgery , include recovery , may last 4 6 week . You take study early find 3 lesion , disease worsens , intolerable side effect . Long-Term Follow-up : After local standard therapy finish , follow-up visit 3 month every 3 month 1st year therapy , every 6 month 2nd 3rd year therapy . At visit , follow test perform : - You periodic test may include MRI scan , PET/CT scan , X-ray , whole-body bone scan check status disease . Your doctor decide test need . The test do every 3 month first year every 6 month next 2 year . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect check status disease . - You complete QOL questionnaire . After completion 36 month visit , encourage follow-up time last visit 1 year . Your doctor may request MRI scan , PET/CT scan , X-ray , and/or whole-body bone scan check status disease . This investigational study . The use local treatment ( surgery radiation therapy ) treat metastatic lesion bone investigational . The use chemotherapy endocrine therapy standard care breast cancer patient metastasis . Up 75 evaluable patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
