	<brief_title>Efficacy Computer Delivered Community Reinforcement Approach ( CRA ) ( Bup II )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Community Reinforcement Approach ( CRA ) contingency management ( CM ) widely research demonstrably efficacious drug abuse treatment . This treatment derive drug self-administration research behavioral analysis drug dependence , abuse drug think compete successfully delay pro-social reinforcer relatively immediate reinforcing effect . The CRA treatment CM approach take theoretical view account ( 1 ) provide immediate positive reinforcement abstinence via voucher reinforcement procedure , ( 2 ) therapist teach skill encourage behavior help improve employment status , family/social relation increase recreational activity via CRA treatment . The incentive abstinence enhancement non-drug source reinforcement expect successfully compete reinforcement drug use . Adoption CRA CM may facilitate could deliver less costly require less staff time implement . In previous trial , demonstrate among buprenorphine maintain opioid-dependent person , computer-delivered CRA CM ( i.e. , voucher incentive ) effective less costly therapist-delivered CRA CM ( i.e. , voucher incentive ) . However , design study indicate whether computer-delivered CRA produce increase abstinence produce CM ( i.e. , voucher incentive ) procedures alone . Thus , believe contribution computerize treatment therapeutic outcomes isolated . In study , include buprenorphine maintain opioid-dependent participant , plan examine whether computer-delivered CRA produce increase abstinence produce CM ( i.e. , voucher incentive ) procedures alone . Specifically , trial compare computer-delivered CRA voucher ( minimal therapist involvement ) voucher incentives alone randomize parallel group design . Participants assign randomly receive one two treatment : ( 1 ) computer-delivered CRA along voucher incentive ( i.e. , CM ) ; ( 2 ) voucher incentive ( i.e. , CM ) alone . Outcome measure include abstinence , retention , HIV-risk behavior , cost-effectiveness . We hypothesize computer-delivered CRA CM efficacious CM . Importantly , trial , treatment intervention reinforce cocaine opioid abstinence . Many opioid-dependent individual also abuse , dependent upon , cocaine . Additionally , opioid-dependent individual also use cocaine represent population substance abuser particularly high-risk HIV infection high level risky drug-injection sexual risk behavior . Nevertheless , polydrug abuse population rarely address . By target drug , understand effective way address polydrug abuse increase . Overall , research contribute new empirical information regard efficacy provide CRA CM . Such information may result cost-effective treatment facilitate dissemination . This research examine utility computerize substantive portion substance abuse treatment . Computerization treatment novel approach may positively impact future drug abuse treatment .</detailed_description>
