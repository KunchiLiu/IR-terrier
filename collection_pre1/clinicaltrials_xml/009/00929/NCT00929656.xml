	<brief_summary>Stroke lead cause long-term disability country 1 million Americans report difficulty daily activity . Loss independence self-care task primarily due limited recovery arm . This study determine addition Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) excite lesioned hemisphere ( side brain affect stroke ) , progressive functional task exercise either weaken arm alone arm together improve arm recovery great degree one two type arm exercise alone . Individuals post-stroke participate 16 session 1 ) arm rehabilitation alone ( weak arm arm together ) 2 ) arm rehabilitation plus TMS . The investigator assess arm movement ability function immediately follow 4-week intervention 30-day follow-up determine retention immediate gain . The investigator hypothesize receive TMS adjuvant improve arm movement ability exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Limited recovery upper extremity ( UE ) function post-stroke continue one greatest challenge face neurorehabilitation . There urgent unmet need identify effective approach drive UE recovery population . In response challenge , overall purpose propose research plan develop rehabilitation intervention restore UE motor recovery . Contemporary approach motor rehabilitation base evidence behavioral experience drive cortical reorganization follow neural injury . Although rationale drive damage motor cortex focus training paretic UE appear straightforward , historically focus rehabilitation , functional recovery remain limited . There remain gap central neurobiological change meaningful behavioral change . There need , therefore , augment potentiate behavioral experience . This proposal address gap examine two potential driver lesioned hemisphere : 1 ) non-lesioned hemisphere via engagement unaffected UE behavioral training 2 ) stimulation lesioned hemisphere via repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) . This proposal build foundation applicant 's previous work suggest contralesional , intact , hemisphere could use drive lesioned hemisphere bimanual movement . Additionally , possible drive lesioned hemisphere externally use rTMS enhance cortical stimulation . Thus , pair externally-driven enhancement cortical excitability internally-driven activation intact hemisphere bilateral movement could combine increase excitability lesioned hemisphere manifest improved movement capability paretic UE . The fundamental hypothesis guide proposal increase excitability lesioned cortex improve behavioral function paretic UE post-stroke . To investigate overall hypothesis investigator examine driver cortical excitability role UE recovery address follow aim : Specific Aim 1 . Determine magnitude difference central behavioral change individual post-stroke hemiparesis randomize bilateral versus unilateral UE motor train program . Specific Aim 2a . Determine magnitude difference central behavioral change individual post-stroke hemiparesis randomize behavioral UE training compare behavioral UE training + rTMS . Specific Aim 2b . Determine differential effect rTMS bilateral behavioral training compare unilateral behavioral training measure centrally behaviorally individual post-stroke hemiparesis Post-stroke upper limb paresis resultant loss functional ability continue present barrier post-stroke return full societal participation . Interventions directly target mechanism hemiparesis , include decrease excitability lesioned hemisphere , likely promote true recovery oppose oft observe functional compensation individual .</detailed_description>
