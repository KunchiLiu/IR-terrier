	<brief_summary>No randomized clinical trial date demonstrate survival benefit use regular HIV-1 ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) viral load ( VL ) test monitor patient ' response antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) HIV infection . The measurement VL recommend monitor response ART develop country . In resource-constrained setting , World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend routine VL testing , part due cost complex infrastructure need reliable result . In setting , WHO propose use clinical CD4+ lymphocyte-based criterion guide treatment decision . However , multiple study demonstrate poor performance criterion sub-Saharan Africa frequent discordance immunologic virologic response ART . The use routine viral load monitoring evaluate resource-constrained setting . The investigator hypothesize routine viral load test patient ART improve patient survival , decrease disease progression development drug resistance , feasible cost-effective resource-constrained setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study 'Effectiveness HIV Viral Load Monitoring Patient Outcome Resource-Poor Settings , ' dual-arm , cluster randomize trial evaluate use routine plasma HIV-1 VL monitoring improve survival decrease HIV disease progression patient receive ART . The primary objective ass mortality 36 month among ART na√Øve patient initiate therapy receive care facility access routine HIV VL test ( ART initiation , 3 month every 6 month thereafter ) compare initiate first regimen receive care facility accord local standard care ( use immunological [ i.e . CD4+ lymphocyte count-based ] clinical criterion diagnose treatment failure , discretionary VL test two agree ) .</detailed_description>
