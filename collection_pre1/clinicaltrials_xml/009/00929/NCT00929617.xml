	<brief_title>Enhancing Physical Activity Adherence After Breast Cancer Diagnosis ( BEAT Cancer II )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical activity may improve quality life , control comorbid condition , weight management reduce breast cancer recurrence mortality among breast cancer survivor . Unfortunately , breast cancer survivor engage regular physical activity . In fact , breast cancer survivor often less active diagnosis may return pre-diagnosis activity level . Therefore , conduct pilot study , `` BEAT Cancer '' , test specifically defined physical activity behavior change intervention increase physical activity breast cancer survivor . The pilot study show significant improvement physical activity health outcome study participant intervention . Importantly , pilot intervention result change physical activity social cognitive theory construct , participant feel confident ability exercise . The positive result enhance potential test mechanisms encourage physical activity behavior change breast cancer survivor . The current study follow-up confirm program effectiveness 3 month test sustainability result 3-12 month . We propose multi-center , randomize control trial enrol 356 breast cancer survivor follow study aim : 1 . To compare effect 3-month BEAT Cancer physical activity behavior change intervention usual care short long term physical activity adherence among breast cancer survivor . We hypothesize , compare usual care , intervention result significant increase physical activity intervention maintain 12 month baseline . 2 . To good understand reason breast cancer patient change physical activity behavior , compare effect BEAT Cancer physical activity behavior change intervention usual care social cognitive factor see change contribute physical activity behavior change . We hypothesize , compare usual care , intervention result significant improvement social cognitive factor lead change physical activity behavior . 3 . We also aim compare short long term health effect BEAT Cancer physical activity behavior change intervention compare usual care . We hypothesize , compare usual care , intervention result significant improvement fitness , muscle strength , waist-to-hip ratio , quality life , fatigue , sleep quality , reduce joint dysfunction .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female breast cancer patient age 18 70 year age diagnosis ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) Stage I , II , IIIA breast cancer currently receive ( plan receive duration study ) chemotherapy radiation therapy . The participant may take long term therapy aromatase inhibitor , estrogen receptor modulators , etc . The upper age limit 70 year choose reduce likelihood adverse event study dropout due increase comorbidities ( e.g. , cardiovascular disease ) occur age . If patient undergone surgical procedure , enrollment delay ≥ 8 week postprocedure . English speaking . Medical clearance participation provide primary care physician oncologist . Participating , average , 60 minute moderate physical activity 30 minute vigorous activity per week past six month . Diagnosis dementia organic brain syndrome . Medical , psychological , social characteristic would interfere ability fully participate program activity assessment ( e.g. , psychosis , schizophrenia , etc. ) . Contraindication participation regular physical activity program . Metastatic recurrent disease . Inability ambulate . Anticipates undergo elective surgery duration intervention would interfere intervention participation ( e.g. , breast reconstructive surgery ) . Planned travel would interfere schedule study session ( travel 1st 4 month travel ≥ 1 week last 8 week intervention ) .</criteria>
