	<brief_title>Preoperative Chemotherapy Bevacizumab Patients With Stage IB ( &gt; 4 cm ) , II , Select Stage III NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adjuvant chemotherapy patient completely resect stage II select stage III NSCLC consider standard therapy . At least three large , prospective randomize trial proven benefit adjuvant chemotherapy improve survival patient ( magnitude benefit range 4-12 % ) . However , patient consider candidate up-front complete resection , preoperative therapy may indicate . Many patient subsequently eligible resection ( bimodality therapy ) . The rationale multicenter , Phase II trial examine impact carboplatin/paclitaxel bevacizumab preoperative treatment patient stage IB ( &gt; 4.0 cm ) , II , select stage III NSCLC . This trial conduct Sarah Cannon Research Institute Oncology Research Consortium . If novel regimen prove safe active setting , would provide rationale investigation large , prospective , randomized setting .</detailed_description>
