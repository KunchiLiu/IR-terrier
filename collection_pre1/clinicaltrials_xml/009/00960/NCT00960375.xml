	<detailed_description>Smoking lead cause preventable death United States . Smoking contributes increase rate disease lung cancer heart disease , add dangerous complication health problem diabetes obesity . Despite widespread recognition devastate health effect smoking , 70 % people schizophrenia serious persistent mental illness ( SPMI ) smoke cigarette , rate least double general population remain high despite decrease rate smoke general population . These extraordinary smoking rate contribute elevate morbidity mortality , life-threatening health-related consequence , increase health care cost treat smoking related illness population . Treating smoke critical improving health people SPMI . The newly revise VA/Department Defense Clinical Practice Guideline Management Tobacco Use outline VHA 's comprehensive program smoking cessation . Beginning 1997 , VA central office direct Agency Health Care Policy Research ( AHCPR ) smoke cessation guideline ( 5 A 's - Ask , Advise , Assess , Assist , Arrange ) implement health care facility . Reinforcing commitment increase veteran ' access evidence-based smoking cessation intervention , VHA recently release new policy mandate smoke cessation treatment make available without restriction VA sit . Our previous study implement 5A 's community mental health clinic find reduced smoking increase use smoke cessation aid nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) , modest increase abstinence . Implementation 5 A 's limited inability adequately assist patient stop smoking . Consideration best supplement `` Assist '' `` Arrange '' phase reveals trouble observation exist `` best practice '' treatment smoke cessation limit effectiveness person SPMI . The widely test treatment consist generally adaptation American Lung Association ( ALA ) comparable 10-14 session weekly group supplement either nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) Bupropion . Such program produce low abstinence rate ( 0-25 % ) end intervention . Sustained abstinence virtually non-existent . Abstinence 6-month 1-year follow-up point range 0-10 % . We develop intervention treatment cocaine heroin use disorder among person SPMI , call Behavioral Treatment Substance Abuse Serious Persistent Mental Illness ( BTSAS ) . BTSAS develop series National Institute Drug Abuse ( NIDA-funded treatment development grant treatment program substance abuse accommodate cognitive motivational impairment characterize SPMI . The goal incorporate strategy find effective reduce drug use generally , tailor meet need people SPMI . BTSAS provide model application 's test innovative smoking cessation treatment . Our basic premise must first acknowledge nicotine dependence addiction characteristic common substance addiction , specify additional biological , social , cognitive , psychological environmental barrier quit smoke people SPMI . We must fully optimize available technology addiction general smoking cessation particular address deficit . Existing approach smoke cessation person SPMI use full range biological , contingency management , social model behavioral tool show work treat addiction population . Further , research treatment substance use disorder person SPMI suggest , best outcome , intervention may need intensive provide group substance abuser . Applied smoking , suggest people SPMI , smoke cessation may need intensive 9 weekly session typical conventional smoking cessation program . Based work develop BTSAS , feature smoke SPMI , develop intervention call Behavioral Treatment Smoking Cessation SPMI ( BTSCS ) , innovative intervention supplement pharmacotherapy education breath carbon monoxide monitoring multifaceted behavioral group treatment program last three month ( 24 session ) . BTSCS design address cognitive , motivational , social support problem characteristic people SPMI . We propose conduct randomize clinical trial compare BTSCS standard smoke cessation treatment . Specific Aims : To determine BTSCS effective produce abstinence smoking manualized smoking cessation program reflect current best practice ( StSST ) . Hypothesis 1 : BTSCS result great rate abstinence StSST show : 1 . A high percentage negative expire carbon monoxide level biweekly treatment session 2 . Increased day abstinence report biweekly treatment session 3 . A high percentage negative expire carbon monoxide level immediately post-treatment . 4 . A high percentage participant report abstinence 7-day interval precede post-treatment assessment . Secondary Aims : We assess effectiveness BTSCS set intermediate outcome include reduction smoking severity improvement readiness quit smoking among smoker able quit . We also assess increase treatment attendance use NRT 's bupropion moderate hypothesize increase abstinence .</detailed_description>
