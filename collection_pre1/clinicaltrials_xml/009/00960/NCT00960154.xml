	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical study quantify difference thermal injury depth surgical margin breast lumpectomy specimen excise PlasmaBlade ; subjectively ass histopathologic sample quality metric ; examine role electrosurgical artifact may play revision lumpectomy procedure ; compare endpoint standard care ( SOC ) technology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PEAK PlasmaBlade™ 4.0 Versus Traditional Electrosurgery Lumpectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lumpectomy surgical procedure perform remove localized mass breast tissue suspicious malignancy . The purpose lumpectomy minimize amount tissue remove breast retain normal breast architecture simultaneously remove suspect cancerous tissue . Typically , scalpel use skin incision traditional electrosurgical device use cut away cancerous tissue . The PEAK PlasmaBlade™ use pulse radiofrequency ( RF ) energy highly-insulated handpiece design enable precision cut coagulation point application . The PlasmaBlade receive FDA clearance use plastic , general , ear , nose , throat ( ENT ) surgery , demonstrate significantly reduce thermal injury profile incise tissue compare traditional electrosurgical device . It hypothesize benefit may improve pathological analysis excise breast lump . This single site study grant Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval conduct June 2009 January 2011 . Potential subject screen inclusion exclusion criterion study protocol require provide informed consent prior enrollment . Following enrollment , subject prospectively randomize SOC PEAK PlasmaBlade study group schedule lumpectomy .</detailed_description>
