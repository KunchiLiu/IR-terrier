	<brief_summary>The propose research demonstrate alternate day modify fasting ( ADMF ) suitable alternative daily calorie restriction ( CR ) weight loss , weight maintenance , heart disease prevention . Since many overweight obese individual find difficult adhere daily CR , diet option may improve adherence dietary restriction protocol . This , turn , allow great percent overweight obese population lose weight , maintain weight loss , prevent future occurrence coronary heart disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alternate Day Fasting Weight Loss , Weight Maintenance Cardio-protection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overweight obese individual increase risk coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . Losing weight mean dietary restriction greatly reduce vascular disease risk . The majority study examiningmost common dietary restriction protocol implement daily calorie restriction ( CR ) . Another dietary restriction regimen employ , although far less commonly , alternate day modify fasting ( ADMF ) . ADMF involve `` feed day '' food consume ad-libitum , alternate `` fast day '' , food intake partially reduce . Previous report show adherence ADMF exceed CR 8 week treatment . This increase adherence ADMF result great weight loss , produce pronounced improvement CHD risk . What yet determine whether adherence ADMF remain near maximal long treatment duration ( 24 week ) , improve adherence result great reduction body weight CHD risk , versus CR . Once weight loss achieve , weight maintenance extremely important CHD risk increase weight regain . Whether ADMF effective strategy weight maintenance remain unknown . Accordingly , aim proposal : Aim 1 : To establish adherence ADMF great CR 24-week intervention period determine increase adherence ADMF result great weight loss ; Aim 2 : To establish great reduction body weight ADMF 24-week period result great improvement traditional CHD risk parameter ( blood pressure , plasma lipid level , cholesterol synthesis rate , LDL particle size , CRP ) emerge CHD risk parameter ( fat cell-derived hormone , body fat distribution , fat cell size ) comparison CR ; Aim 3 : To establish ADMF effective diet therapy maintain weight loss sustain improvement CHD risk indicator , compare change cognitive behavioral component eat ADMF CR subject . A 52-week randomized , control , parallel-arm feed trial implement test objective . The trial divide 3 consecutive intervention period : ( 1 ) 4-week baseline ; ( 2 ) 24-week weight loss food provide ; ( 3 ) 24-week weight maintenance food provide . Overweight obese subject ( n = 90 ) randomize 1 3 group : ( 1 ) ADMF , 75 % energy restriction `` fast day '' ad libitum feed `` feed day '' ; ( 2 ) CR , 25 % restriction everyday ; 3 ) control , 100 % energy intake everyday . During weight maintenance phase , ADMF subject consume 25 % energy need `` fast day '' 175 % need `` feed day '' , CR control subject consume 100 % need everyday . Our finding show ADMF implement alternative CR help overweight obese individual lose weight , maintain weight loss , sustain reduction CHD risk . This study also generate insight specific behavioral change occur ADMF explain ADMF successful diet strategy weight maintenance .</detailed_description>
