	<detailed_description>The search communicating vein ( CVs ) adjacent hepatic vein ( HVs ) draw rationale need reduce risk incomplete blood outflow medial portion hemiliver without middle hepatic vein ( MHV ) live donor liver transplantation ( LDLT ) . However , 24 % patient seem CVs base finding color-Doppler intraoperative ultrasound ( CD-IOUS ) exploration . On hand safety parenchymal spar procedure despite HV resection let suppose CVs probably frequent expect . Certainly , good vivo knowledge rate CVs direct detection would consolidate probably expand parenchymal spar technique . Taking profit new advancement ultrasound technology carry present study aim well estimate rate CVs consecutive series patient resection one HV caval confluence need .</detailed_description>
