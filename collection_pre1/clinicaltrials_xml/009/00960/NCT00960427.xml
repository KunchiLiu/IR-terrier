	<brief_title>Studying Biomarkers Tumor Tissue Blood Samples From Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy Stage II Stage III Rectal Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To obtain distribution stem cell marker ( CD166 , CD44 , ESA ) tumor tissue sample neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( NCRT ) patient stage II III rectal cancer . Secondary - To correlate disease-free survival NCRT baseline expression change expression stem cell marker ( CD166 , CD44 , ESA ) NCRT . - To correlate baseline post-NCRT expression three stem cell marker ( CD166 , CD44 , ESA ) circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) count stem cell marker expression CTC baseline NCRT . OUTLINE : Patients receive chemotherapy accord treat physician 's choice undergo concurrent radiotherapy approximately 6 week . Between 6-8 week completion neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( NCRT ) , patient undergo low anterior abdominoperineal surgical resection . Some patient may receive additional chemotherapy . Tumor tissue sample obtain via sigmoidoscopy-guided biopsy baseline time surgery . Blood sample also collect baseline completion NCRT . Samples isolate RNA analysis CD44 , CD166 , ESA expression quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR IHC . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
