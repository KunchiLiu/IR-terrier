	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine high safe dose XL184 administer orally combination temozolomide ( TMZ , Temodar® ) radiation therapy ( RT ) . XL184 new chemical entity inhibit VEGFR2 , MET , RET , kinases implicated tumor formation , growth migration . Temozolomide ( TMZ , Temodar® ) orally administer alkylating agent . It approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment newly diagnose glioblastoma ( GB ) patient give combination radiation therapy ( RT ) follow maintenance treatment . First-line treatment patient GB consist concurrent phase ( 6-7 week duration ) TMZ give RT , follow rest phase ( 4 week duration ; allow recovery delay toxicity , present ) , maintenance phase , patient receive TMZ approximately twelve 28-day cycle . To determine high safe dose , subject receive different amount XL184 different time accord phase TMZ radiation therapy . The first group subject receive low dose XL184 . As long medically unacceptable side effect note , dose increased next group . If dose well-tolerated first group subject , dose lower next group .</brief_summary>
