	<detailed_description>Tension free mesh repair common procedure inguinal hernia repair . Conventional heavy weight polypropylene mesh report stimulate inflammatory reaction responsible mesh shrinkage scar tissue form . In addition , mesh require fixation suture postulation fixation technique relate postoperative chronic groin pain . Therefore , author recommend use light-weight mesh limit extent fixation use non-compressive absorbable device . In order reduce complication , new self-gripping semi-resorbable mesh develop anterior tension-free inguinal hernia repair . The aim study compare difference operating time open inguinal hernia repair conventional prolene mesh ProgripTM , light-weight mesh self-adhesive mechanism . Methodology : Patients present first episode inguinal hernia include study . Those sizable defect ( &gt; 3cm defect ) , bilateral , inguino-scrotal hernia , irreducible , recurrence exclude study . Informed consent sign procedure detail randomization explain . Operations perform supervision specialist surgeon . Standardized inguinal dissection perform . Randomization carry immediately placement mesh adequate inguinal dissection . PI / co-investigator phone research assistant ask randomization result generate computer . Total operative time , time mesh placement wound closure , blood loss , intra-operative complication , hospital stay , post-operative pain analgesic use document . Post-operative follow-up : Follow-up day 14 , 3 month , 6 month 1 year post-op . Pain score , paraesthesia , chronic discomfort / pain , recurrence , seroma formation , testicular atrophy document . Thereafter , yearly follow-up perform clinic telephone document recurrence chronic pain . Parietene ProGrip™ ( PP1208DR/ PP1208DL ) Manufacturer : Sofradim Production Material : Monofilaments polypropylene polylactic acid ( PLA ) Color : Clear ( undyed ) Weight : 80g/m2 ( PLA resorbtion ) , 40g/m2 ( PLA resorbtion ) Poresize : 1.7mm x 1mm Material detailed description : Parietene ProGrip™ first bio-component mesh comprise monofilament polyester resorbable polylactic acid ( PLA ) grip system perfect true tension-free repair . The microhools cover entire underside material allow complete anchor mesh tissue . Self-gripping feature also allow strong solid self-anchoring fixation therefore make hernia sac fit perfectly groin anatomy move less underneath prosthesis . Therefore , less suture require operative time save . Also less chance nerve entrapment may cause low postoperative pain . Surgipro Mesh ( SPMM-35 ) Material : Monofilaments polypropylene Color : Clear ( undyed ) Measurement : 15cmx15cm Thickness : 0.57mm Description : SURGIPRO Mesh non-absorbable , inert , sterile , porous surgical mesh knit mono-filament fiber polypropylene polymer . The mesh exhibit high burst strength tensile strength . The mesh knit fashion interconnect mono-filament fiber provide bi-dimensional elasticity allow mesh cut shape without unravel . Actions : SURGIPRO Mesh porous , non-absorbable mesh use repair reinforce fascial defect follow surgery trauma serve provide additional support wound follow wound heal period . Animal study show polypropylene mono-filament fiber SURGIPRO Mesh manufacture elicit minimal acute inflammatory reaction tissue , follow gradual encapsulation fibrous tissue . In-growth fibrous tissue permit porosity knit mesh structure . The mesh remain soft pliable non-absorbable polypropylene fiber comprise mesh resists loss tensile strength vivo .</detailed_description>
