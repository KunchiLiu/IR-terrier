	<brief_summary>Body iron level may important determine blood pressure lung change response low oxygen level . At high altitude , oxygen level low , patient develop elevate lung blood pressure . The investigator hypothesize , high altitude resident elevate lung blood pressure , iron supplementation cause reduction lung blood pressure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pulmonary hypertensive disorder frequently complicate hypoxic lung disease worsen patient survival . Hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension also major cause morbidity high altitude . Hypoxia cause pulmonary hypertension hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction vascular remodelling . These process think regulate least part hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) family transcription factor , coordinate intracellular response hypoxia throughout body . HIF regulate cellular degradation process require iron obligate cofactor . In cultured cell HIF degradation inhibit reduced iron availability ( chelation desferrioxamine ) potentiate iron supplementation . In human , laboratory experiment last eight hour show acute iron supplementation blunts pulmonary vascular response hypoxia , acute iron chelation desferrioxamine enhance response . These finding suggest iron may also affect pulmonary vascular response hypoxia long time period . The purpose study , take place high altitude Kyrgyzstan , investigate whether iron supplementation reduce pulmonary artery pressure patient establish high altitude pulmonary hypertension .</detailed_description>
