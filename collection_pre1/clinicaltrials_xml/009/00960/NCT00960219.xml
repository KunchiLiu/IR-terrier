	<brief_summary>Adjuvant N-methyl-D-aspartic acid ( NMDA ) -enhancing agent , GlyT-1 inhibitor NMDA-glycine site agonist demonstrate beneficial chronic schizophrenia patient . The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety add-on treatment inhibitor D-amino acid oxidase ( DAAOI ) , DAAOI-1 , chronically stable schizophrenia patient stabilized antipsychotic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>D-amino Acid Oxidase Inhibition ( DAAOI-1 ) add-on Treatment Chronic Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The etiology schizophrenia remain unclear . Schizophrenia patient reveal positive symptom , negative symptom , cognitive impairment . In addition dopamine system hyperactivity , hypofunction N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor play role pathophysiology schizophrenia . Consequently , enhance NMDA receptor neurotransmission regard novel treatment approach . To date , several report trial adjuvant NMDA-enhancing agent , include glycine , D-amino acid ( D-serine , D-alanine ) , sarcosine ( glycine transporter I inhibitor ) , reveal beneficial limited efficacy positive negative symptom . DAAOI-1 D-amino acid oxidase ( DAAO ) inhibitor elevate synaptic concentration D-amino acid . The aim project examine efficacy safety add-on treatment DAAOI-1 chronically stable schizophrenia patient stabilized antipsychotic . In study , 60 schizophrenic patient recruit 6-week trial randomly assign two group ( 1 gm/dDAAOI-1 , placebo ) double-blind manner . Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) , Scales Assessment Negative symptom ( SANS ) , Global Assessment Function ( GAF ) , quality life ( QOL ) , Hamilton Depression rating scale 17 ( HAM-D 17 ) , Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) side effect evaluate every two week trial . Cognitive function ( `` 7 domain Measurement Treatment Research Improve Cognition Schizophrenia '' [ MATRICS ] ) assess week 0 6 . The efficacy two group compare .</detailed_description>
