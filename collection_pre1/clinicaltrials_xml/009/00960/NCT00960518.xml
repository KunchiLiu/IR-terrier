	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one prevalent malignancy China , approximately 90 % patient HCC also infect hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . Until , standard therapy establish treatment hepatocellular carcinoma . For patient unresectable disease , goal palliative treatment control symptoms prolong survival . Transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) use iodize oil chemotherapeutic agent combine effect target chemotherapy ischemic necrosis induce arterial embolization . It administer repeatedly prolong survival patient unresectable hypervascular HCC . The long-term prognosis , however , remain guarded frequent development locoregional tumor recurrence , , together concomitant hepatic decompensation , main cause death . Recurrence liver remnant may originate metastasis primary tumor multicentric new primary cirrhotic liver . Adefovir work block reverse transcriptase , enzyme crucial hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) reproduce body . It approve treatment chronic hepatitis B adult evidence active viral replication either evidence persistent elevation serum aminotransferase ( primarily ALT ) histologically active disease . The main benefit adefovir lamivudine ( first NRTI approve treatment hepatitis B ) take much long period time virus develops resistance . Adefovir dipivoxil contain two pivaloyloxymethyl unit , make prodrug form Adefovir . Based result , investigator conduct randomize control trial test hypothesis adefovir treatment would reduce postpone recurrence rate improve overall survival rate patient TACE treatment HBV-related unresectable HCC .</detailed_description>
