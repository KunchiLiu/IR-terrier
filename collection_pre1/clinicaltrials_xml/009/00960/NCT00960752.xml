	<brief_title>Tumor Vaccine Site With Toll Like Receptor ( TLR ) Agonist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug/Vaccines : Resiquimod ( R848 ) design increase production antigen-specific T-cells , activate immune cell , increase T-cells go tumor , may cause tumor cell die . gp100 ( g209-2M ) MAGE-3 vaccine design stimulate immune cell , also call T-cells , may help immune system recognize kill melanoma cell . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , metastatic melanoma , assign Group 3 . If melanoma remove want treated try keep come back , randomly assign ( flip coin ) Group 1 2 . - If Group 1 , receive vaccine gp100 ( g209-2M ) MAGE-3 R848 8 week . After 8 week , melanoma lesion , apply R848 half lesion body 16 week . - If Group 2 , receive vaccine ( gp100 ( g209-2M ) MAGE-3 ) 8 week . After 8 week , melanoma lesion , apply R848 half lesion body 16 week . - If Group 3 , receive vaccine gp100 ( g209-2M ) MAGE-3 R848 8 week . After 8 week , melanoma lesion , apply R848 half lesion body 16 week . After 8 week , long melanoma lesion , complete study treatment . Study Drug/Vaccine Administration : Once week 8 week , receive vaccine , gp100 ( g209-2M ) MAGE-3 , intradermally ( needle skin ) subcutaneously ( needle skin ) 2 separate site separate extremity . Half dose give one way , half give way . These vaccine also give day . You receive total 4 injection week . If Group 1 , every time vaccine injection , R848 apply gel gp100 ( g209-2M ) injection site . The R848 gel allow air dry 30 minute cover gauze dress remain overnight . After 8 week , participant melanoma lesion , 2 time week 16 week , apply R848 gel half lesion body . You give write instruction `` hands-on '' demonstration apply gel . You also give worksheet help apply gel . Study Visits : One day first dose vaccine ( Day 2 ) , punch biopsy vaccine injection site check immune system . A punch biopsy hollow instrument use remove small coin-shaped sample tissue . At Week 2 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) drawn study immune response vaccine combination . - You punch biopsy injection site check immune system day vaccine give . Every 4 week , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) drawn study immune response vaccine combination . Every 8 week , participant metastatic disease , follow test procedure perform : - You CT PET/CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . - The tumor measure photographed . Your private area cover ( much possible ) , picture face take unless tumor face . - If doctor think necessary , tumor measure CT scan . - If doctor think need , MRI/CT brain check status disease . The day first start gel ( Week 8 ) , 2 punch tumor biopsy check immune system . One biopsy lesion R848 one without , available . For participant without disease , study complete follow-up decide doctor . At Week 0 ( vaccine start ) , treatment Week 8 ( +/- 1 week ) . , Week 16 ( +/- 1 week ) , white blood cell collect leukapheresis test antibody . If leukapheresis , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw well . If leukapheresis , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw instead . The leukapheresis procedure research-related would perform standard care study . Blood leukapheresis take needle vein one arm . A solution add keep blood clotting go machine collect remove white blood cell blood . The remain blood return needle vein arm . This may take 3-4 hour . Although several pint blood go machine , 1/2 pint ( 1 cup ) machine time . If needle vein , blood remove thorough central venous catheter ( CVC ) . A CVC sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . You give another informed consent document sign , describes risk CVC care involve . Length Study : You continue receive treatment 4 6 month , long may benefit study respond gel . You take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . If group without disease , receive study treatment . Follow-Up : All three group call 1 time month 12 month come study drug check status disease . This investigational study . The study drugs/vaccines gp100 ( g209-2M ) , MAGE-3 , R848 FDA approve commercially available . At time , use research . Up 71 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
