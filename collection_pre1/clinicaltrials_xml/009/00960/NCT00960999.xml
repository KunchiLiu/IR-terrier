	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . It yet know regimen stereotactic body radiation therapy effective treating patient non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study side effect two radiation therapy regimens see well work treat patient stage I non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine 1-year rate ≥ grade 3 adverse event definitely , probably , possibly relate treatment single fraction v multiple fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy medically inoperable patient stage I peripheral non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary - To estimate 1-year primary tumor control rate patient . - To estimate 1-year overall survival disease-free survival rate patient . - To assess FDG-PET ( fluorodeoxyglucose ) standardize uptake value change measure treatment response outcome . - To determine pulmonary function change treatment arm response . - To determine association biomarkers primary tumor control and/or ≥ grade 2 radiation pneumonitis . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord Zubrod performance status ( 0 vs 1 v 2 ) T stage ( T1 v T2 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( single fraction ) : Patients undergo one stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) treatment target lesion . - Arm II ( multiple fraction ) : Patients undergo SBRT target lesion daily 4 day . Blood tumor tissue sample may collect analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
