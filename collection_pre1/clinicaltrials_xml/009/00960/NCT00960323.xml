	<detailed_description>Colchicine substrate cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) . In-vitro study indicate ortho-and para-hydroxylated metabolite atorvastatin may CYP3A4 /5 competitive mechanism-based inhibitor ( MBI ) . This study evaluate effect multiple dos atorvastatin pharmacokinetic profile single 0.6 mg dose colchicine . Twenty-four healthy , non-smoking , non-obese , non-pregnant adult volunteer age 18 45 give one oral dose colchicine ( 1 x 0.6 mg tablet ) Day 1 overnight fast . Blood sample draw participant dose 24 hour post-dose time sufficient adequately define pharmacokinetics colchicine . After 14 day washout period , start morning Day 15 continue Day 27 , subject return clinic daily administration atorvastatin ( 1 x 40 mg tablet ) overnight fast . After take first dose atorvastatin Day 15 , subject remain clinic 1 hour post-dose administration observation . On morning Day 28 overnight fast , study participant receive co-administered single oral dose colchicine ( 1 x 0.6 mg tablet ) atorvastatin ( 1 x 40 mg tablet ) . Blood sample draw participant dose twenty-four hour post-dose time sufficient adequately define pharmacokinetics colchicine presence atorvastatin steady state . A goal study evaluate safety tolerability regimen healthy volunteer . Subjects monitor throughout participation study adverse reaction study drug and/or procedure . Seated blood pressure pulse , respiratory rate temperature measure screening , baseline upon study discharge . Blood pressure pulse also measure pre-dose 1 2 hour post-dose Days 1 28 coincide peak plasma concentration colchicine atorvastatin . All adverse event whether elicited query , spontaneously report , observe clinic staff evaluate investigator report subject 's case report form .</detailed_description>
