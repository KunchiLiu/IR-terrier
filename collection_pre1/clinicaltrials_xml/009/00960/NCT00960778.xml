	<brief_summary>This study investigate underlying neurobiology difference male female smoker . Research suggest woman less responsive nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) men responsive sensory behavioral aspect smoke . This study propose male smoker great response NRT demonstrate reduce withdrawal symptom , crave , less blood-oxygen-level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging ( BOLD FMRI ) regional brain activation response nicotine-cues compare female smoker treat NRT . Additionally , female smoker great response denicotinized cigarette decrease withdrawal symptom , crave , less BOLD fMRI activation response nicotine-cues compare male smoker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Women smoker less responsive nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) responsive environmental cue associate smoke behavior . This pilot study design increase understand neural circuitry underlie difference . In proposed study , adult male female ( 10 per group ) treatment-seeking nicotine-dependent individual participate functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) presentation smoking-related cue three condition seven day period : baseline , NRT , denicotinized cigarette facilitated-extinction . After baseline scanning , subject receive three day 21 mg nicotine patch . Scanning procedure repeat day 3 . Subjects receive denicotinized cigarette ad lib smoking day three seven . Subjects ask remain abstinent throughout study period assess daily self-report , CO monitor nicotine withdrawal .</detailed_description>
