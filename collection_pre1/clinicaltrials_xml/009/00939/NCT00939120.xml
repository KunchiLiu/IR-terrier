	<brief_title>Dutasteride With Tolterodine ER Placebo Treat Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms ( LUTS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Men treat alpha blocker ( AB ) 5-alpha reductase inhibitor ( 5-ARI ) benign prostatic enlargement ( BPE ) low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) often symptoms include urinary frequency urgency . ABs 5-ARIs may improve obstructive voiding symptom necessarily storage symptom . This study evaluate safety efficacy dutasteride 0.5 mg daily 6 month open label fashion . Those patient continue report storage urinary symptom , randomize receive dutasteride 0.5 mg daily additional one year together double-blind tolterodine ER 4 mg match tolterodine ER placebo daily .</detailed_description>
