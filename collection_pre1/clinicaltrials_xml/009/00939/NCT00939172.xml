	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : TTP607 design work block action certain enzyme ( protein ) blood responsible abnormal growth cancer cell . This may cause cancer cell eventually die . Dose Level Assignment : If find eligible take part study , enrol group 3-6 participant . The dose receive base join study ( many participant enrol , safety data available time ) . The first group participant receive low dose TTP607 . Each new group participant receive next high dose study drug , long intolerable side effect occur . This process continue high tolerable dose TTP607 reach . Once high tolerable dose find , 12 additional participant enrol treat dose , researcher learn effect study drug tumor . Both study doctor know dose study drug receiving . Study Drug Administration : Starting Day 1 Cycle 1 , receive TTP607 central venous catheter ( CVC central venous line ) . There several type central venous catheter . Each type catheter flexible , long , thin tube insert vein , local anesthetic , small cut chest ( near heart ) . Some chemotherapy drug suitable give vein hand arm , drug must give large vein . The CVC may also use draw blood sample need regularly . Using CVC blood draw low need repeat blood draw arm . TTP607 give 1-4 hour depend dose receive , day 5 day row , follow 10-day `` rest period '' ( study drug ) . This 15 day consider 1 cycle . Study Visits : On Day 1 ( All Cycles ) : You tests/procedures study visit : - Your vital sign take . - You blood ( 1-2 tablespoon time ) drawn urine collect routine test . - You ask medication may take side effect may experience since last visit . - You ECG . - You brief physical exam routine eye exam . - You compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan check size tumor . - You complete questionnaire ( 1 question ) rate quality life past week . It take 1 minute complete . - Women able child urine pregnancy test . On Days 2-5 ( All Cycles ) : The following tests/procedures perform start study drug infusion : - You ask side effect may since last visit . - Your weight measure . After infusion , vital sign measure . On Days 2-5 ( Cycle 1 ) : You ECG perform , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon time ) urine collect routine test . On Days 8 , 10 , 12 ( Cycle 1 ) : You tests/procedures study visit : - You complete questionnaire rate quality life past week . - You ask medication may take since last visit side effect . - You ECG ( Day 8 ) . - You blood ( 2-3 teaspoon time ) urine collect routine test . - You brief physical exam routine eye exam . - Your weight measure ( Days 8 12 ) . - Your vital sign measure . On Days 3 5 ( Cycles 2 3 ) : You ECG . On Days 2 , 3 , 5 ( Cycles 2 3 ) : You blood ( 2-3 teaspoon time ) drawn urine collect routine test . On Days 8-12 ( Cycles 2 , 3 , Further Cycles ) : At least time Days 8 12 , return clinic follow tests/procedures : - You complete questionnaire rate quality life past week ( Day 12 even-numbered cycle ) . - You ask medication may take since last visit side effect . - You ECG ( Cycles 2 3 ) . - You blood ( 2-3 teaspoon time ) urine collect routine test . - You brief physical exam routine eye exam . - Your weight vital sign measure . On Day 5 ( Cycle 4 Further Cycles ) : You blood ( 2-3 teaspoon time ) urine collect routine test . PK Testing : You blood ( 2-3 teaspoon time ) urine sample collect different time PK test TTP607 . Cycle 1 : Days 1 5 : Blood drawn immediately infusion , 30 minute infusion , 60 minute immediately infusion , 15 minute , 30 minute , 45 minute , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 hour infusion . On Day 1 , urine collect immediately infusion within 3 hour , 3 7 hour , 7 12 hour , 12 24 hour infusion . On Day 5 , urine collect infusion within 3 hour 3 7 hour infusion . Days 2 , 3 , 4 : Blood drawn immediately infusion 1 hour end infusion . Urine collect immediately infusion within 2 hour end infusion . Day 8 : Blood drawn convenient time , urine collect first arrive clinic . Cycles 2 3 : Days 1 5 : Blood drawn infusion 1 2 hour infusion , urine collect infusion within 2 hour infusion . Days 8-12 : Blood draw convenient time , urine collect first arrive clinic . Cycle 4 Further Cycles : Day 5 : Blood draw 1 hour infusion , urine collect immediately infusion within 2 hour infusion . Length Study : You continue study , long study doctor think safe continue , cancer get bad , intolerable side effect occur . If continue cycle , study drug schedule tests/procedures study visit , though may perform less often . End-of-Study Visit : Once study reason , end-of-study visit 30 day last dose study drug . During visit , follow tests/procedures : - You complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw urine collect routine test . - You ECG . - You complete questionnaire rate quality life past week . - Women able child blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . This investigational study . TTP607 FDA approve commercially available . At time , use research purpose . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
