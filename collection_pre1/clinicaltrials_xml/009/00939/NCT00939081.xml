	<detailed_description>Long-term promotion physical activity necessary achieve obesity prevention . This represent particular challenge intervention design , study demonstrate positive long-term physical activity promotion outcomes among Black woman . We demonstrate utility pedometer among low income , ethnically diverse population . The efficacy pedometer utilization prevention weight gain , however , hinge long-term utilization device . We hypothesize recommendation step count attainment may affect individual 's long-term utilization pedometer , well physical activity level BMI . This study 24-week experimental trial examine whether intervention recommendation promote long-term adherence pedometer-based physical activity regimen . A two-group , block design use propose study . Eligible woman randomly assign one two experimental condition ( n=75 per condition ) : 1 ) receive 10,000 steps/day recommendation 3 health education session 2 ) receive adaptive recommendation obesity prevention intervention . The adaptive step recommendation update participant ' recommended step count , start 7,000 steps/day , 8,000 steps/day , finally 10,000 steps/day . Participants adaptive recommendation group provide 3 educational session ask report daily progress weight maintenance goal via text message . Participants provide pedometer ask wear every day 24-week trial period . Assessments ( include self-report survey anthropometric measurement ) conduct baseline , 12 week 24 week post-baseline .</detailed_description>
