	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , bendamustine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer cell growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cell-killing substance . Giving bendamustine together rituximab may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect give bendamustine together rituximab see well work treat patient B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia respond previous treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0902 Bendamustine Rituximab Treating Patients With B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia That Has Not Responded Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To test whether response rate ( CR , CRi , PR ) patient purine analog-refractory , B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) treatment combination bendamustine hydrochloride rituximab sufficiently high warrant investigation . - To evaluate safety tolerability bendamustine hydrochloride rituximab patient B-cell CLL refractory treatment purine-nucleoside analog-containing regimen . - To investigate , preliminary manner , prognostic effect pre-treatment cytogenetic abnormality identify conventional cytogenetics FISH analyse response treatment patient population . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 bendamustine IV 30 minute day 1-2 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In course 1 , patient also receive rituximab IV day 2 . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
