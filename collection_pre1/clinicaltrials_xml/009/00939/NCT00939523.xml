	<brief_summary>PURPOSE The drug Lapatinib show inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) erbB2 tyrosine kinase result effective slow disease progression breast cancer . It also demonstrate erbB overexpressed human pituitary adenoma . The investigator therefore assess tumor size stabilization pituitary tumor secretory profile course six month therapy lapatinib . The purpose trial estimate activity lapatinib slow growth rate pituitary tumor . Lapatinib FDA approve drug use treat breast cancer . However , study , drug use treat pituitary cancer . STUDY POPULATION This study recruit patient Pituitary Center CSMC age 18 recurrent nonfunctioning adenoma least one surgical resection well patient prolactinomas resistant dopamine agonist therapy patient recurrent Cushing 's disease . PARTICIPANT 'S JOURNEY THROUGH THE RESEARCH The principal investigator ( PI ) co-investigator determine patient ' potential eligibility study base inclusion exclusion criterion . The PI co-investigator approach subject recurrent nonfunctioning adenomas prolactinomas resistant dopamine agonist therapy recurrent Cushing 's disease visit clinic office ask subject would interest participate study . If subject express interest , give consent form review . They encourage review family , friend , and/or physician . The PI , co-investigators , research nurse available question subject might . If subject still interested , ask sign return consent form office study visit schedule . The PI , co-investigator , member study staff may also attempt contact current patient phone assess interest participate study . The purpose overall structure study discuss possible participant . They remind study strictly voluntary involvement disinterest study affect ongoing care . If patient interested mail consent review ask call center schedule appointment discus study decide interested . Each participant undergo 8 visit course study . Each participant baseline visit medical history take , physical , visual field test , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , echocardiogram ( ECHO ) , blood draw perform . At point lapatinib therapy begin patient ask take drug daily next six month . Patients take Lapatinib 1250 mg daily ( orally ) , standardize dose use treat breast cancer patient . Visit 2 1 month participant start lapatinib . At visit 2 participant receive physical exam , history take , ECG perform , blood draw occur . Visit 3 2 month start lapatinib . A physical exam history perform along ECG echocardiogram blood draw . Visit 4 3 month start lapatinib . A physical , history , blood draw , ECG , visual field test , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) pituitary perform . Visit 5 occur 4 month start lapatinib . A physical exam history along blood draw ECG echocardiogram occur . Visit 6 5 month start lapatinib . A physical exam , history , ECG , blood draw occur . Visit 7 occur 6 month start lapatinib . A physical exam , history , blood draw , visual field test , ECG , echocardiogram MRI pituitary occur . At point lapatinib discontinue . Visit 8 occur 1 month visit 7 physical exam , history , blood draw , ECG echocardiogram occur .</brief_summary>
