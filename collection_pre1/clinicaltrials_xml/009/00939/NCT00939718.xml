	<brief_title>Comparison Vitamin B12 Supplementation Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor ( SSRI ) Versus SSRI Antidepressant Treatment Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin B12 play important role DNA synthesis neurological function . Its deficiency associate hematological , neurological psychiatric manifestation latter include irritability , personality change , depression , dementia rarely , psychosis . Recent literature see link vitamin depression . High B12 level serum associate good treatment response , high homocysteine level common folate / B12 deficiency suffer depression . Hyperhomocysteinemia may direct effect neurotransmitter implicate depression . Randomized trial show folate nutritional supplementation strategy atleast significant effect treat treatment-resistant depression . Folate deficiency also link delay treatment response well relapse . To date trial Pakistan compare anti-depressant monotherapy B12 augmentation population show poor partial response first drug trial . The investigator aim compare clinical response SSRI-monotherapy B12-augmentation sample depress patient . Objective To compare reduction depression patient low normal B12 level SSRI monotherapy patient combination SSRI Vitamin B12 supplementation . Hypothesis There high response rate among patient treat combined SSRI therapy B12 supplementation compare treated SSRI alone . Operational Definitions Depression : Patients score ≥ 16 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression-Urdu version ( HAM-D ) 24 , 25 Low B12 level : ( &lt; 300 pg/ml ) Design open label Trial Setting Study Out patient clinic department Psychiatry Aga Khan University Hospital , Karachi Pakistan . Duration 12 month approval protocol Sample Size Calculation A total 232 patient equally divide two group achieve 90 percent power , 5 percent level significance use one sided hypothesis anticipate difference response rate 20 percent two group 30 percent response rate among SSRI group atleast 50 % combination treatment group . Considering 15 percent drop group additional sample 36 patient equally divide two group recruit make total require sample 268 patient . Therefore sample size require arm would 134 . Sampling Technique 268 consecutive patient - fulfill inclusion criterion give - present physician PAMH Clinic recruit informed consent . Consequently , 134 would randomize SSRI-monotherapy group B12 augmentation group Method Patients recruit outpatient clinic AKUH among receive diagnosis major depressive disorder qualify psychiatrist . After explain research study simple language register informed consent . At point unique ID assign form alpha numeric code attach ID computer number obtain number series use similar trial The research officer administer Urdu version HAM-D scale . A blood sample participant drawn phlebotomist Aga Khan University Hospital clinical laboratory . Cold chain maintain throughout . Those fulfil eligibility criterion recruit study . After recruitment number randomize two arm study computer . The procedure perform data entry operator affiliation research team hire per diem basis purpose . Final recruitment may take place next visit B12 level back . The entire process monitor research officer supervise consultant psychiatrist AKUH clinic also principal investigator . The research officer well supervisor blind arm allocation know code Arms A B . Participants monotherapy arm receive SSRI . Those B12 arm concomitantly administer B12 intramuscular injectable 1000 mcg every week 06 week . HAM-D scoring monitor baseline 12 week baseline . The investigator also blind group assignment blind outcome assessment.The injectables pick research officer patient main pharmacy AKUH designate pharmacy outlet within AKUH campus . Any adverse effect oral medication injection ( B12 placebo ) monitor documented progress sheet patient folder treat accord guideline standard care . In case unfortunate rare event anaphylactic shock patient manage accord AKUH protocol . A crash cart available clinic time . The registered nurse always present clinic ACLS certify Instruments Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) 24 , 25 21-item , multiple-choice questionnaire screen severity depression . Available several language , Urdu version translate clinically validated25 . Therefore pilot study conduct 10 % sample size target population compare diagnosis psychiatric interview along DSM-IV criterion depression ( gold standard ) . The item comprise cardinal biological symptom depression first 17 item , 3 question rule paranoia obsession . A score ≥ 16 first 17-items correlate clinical depression .</detailed_description>
