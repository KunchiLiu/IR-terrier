	<brief_summary>Clofarabine drug approve FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) treat child ( age 1-21 ) leukemia . This research study use clofarabine two cancer fight drug . Clofarabine use together etoposide ( VePesid® , VP-16 ) cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan® ) . Clofarabine , etoposide cyclophosphamide use together phase I study find high dos drug safely give child relapse refractory leukemia . This study phase II study use drug study well drug work AML . This study also examine safety drug combination .</brief_summary>
