	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Ateronon , nutritional supplement contain lycopene tomato favorable effect carotid atherosclerosis , lipid level , biomarkers coronary heart disease . The trial stop early due insufficient financial support initial study collaborator , Cambridge Theranostics Ltd . Collected patient data sufficient final trial-based analysis conduct financial support new study collaborator , CamNutra Ltd . The data still analyze accord original study aim .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Lycopene/Ateronon Secondary Prevention Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lycopene , carotenoid mainly find tomato-based food product , strong antioxidant property relative carotenoid postulate play role prevention coronary heart disease variety mechanism . Lycopene cook consume oil medium optimal efficient absorption , also potential clinical effectiveness . Studies also link serum lycopene early stage atherosclerosis , measure carotid artery intima-media thickness ( IMT ) , noninvasive ultrasound examination carotid arteries potential surrogate endpoint subsequent cardiovascular morbidity mortality use previous clinical trial vitamin supplement . Short-term intervention study lycopene supplement limited , explored mechanism lycopene readily absorbable food source may increase plasma lycopene induce change relevant biochemical marker impact subsequent risk coronary heart disease . Ateronon lycopene supplement develop understand potential clinical effectiveness lycopene impact bioavailability . A single daily 7 mg tablet Ateronon provide bioavailable lycopene diet alone , absorb efficiently , completely inhibit atherogenic lipid oxidation process subject . Clinical study suggest short-term treatment Ateronon among coronary heart disease lead favorable reduction lipid level , lipoprotein oxidation , blood pressure , Rose-Blackburn score . Therefore , conduct randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial 7 mg Ateronon take daily 1 year among 200 patient age â‰¥50 year stable coronary heart disease . This clinical trial collaborative effort Division Preventive Medicine Vascular Medicine Program Division Cardiology . Our primary aim whether take Ateronon 1 year associate favorable change carotid IMT . Secondary aim expand whether Ateronon lead favorable 1-year change coronary biomarkers relate oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction ; blood pressure ; plasma carotenoid ; AtheroAbzyme level ; traditional coronary biomarkers . This clinical trial Ateronon seek improve understand various mechanism Ateronon , concentrate highly bioavailable form lycopene , may reduce risk develop coronary heart disease .</detailed_description>
