	<detailed_description>Study set The study conduct 10 district fully implement DOTS program health facility order determine whether good patient quality care convenience use three TB care option could improve treatment outcome . In study district 149 tabias 1163 kushets 1.2 million resident represent 30 % total population region . All public health facility ( 8 hospital , 11 health centre 48 health post ) district include . District hospital health centre provide TB diagnostic service . The study district comprise 2316 volunteer community health worker ( CHWs ) functional accountable public health system . Study population Patients recruit 10 study district public health institution serve urban rural population . New patient diagnose study district ( 8 hospital 10 health centre ) refer treatment include . Patients suspect pulmonary tuberculosis ( PTB ) disease diagnose base follow case definition : 1 . A patient least one follow criterion diagnose smear positive PTB : 1 . Two initial smear examination positive direct microscopy acid-fast bacillus ( AFB ) , 2 . One initial smear examination positive direct microscopy culture positive , 3 . One initial smear examination positive direct microscopy x-ray abnormality suggestive active TB determine physician . 2 . A patient diagnose smear negative PTB three initial smear examination negative direct microscopy AFB , failure respond course broad-spectrum antibiotic follow three negative smear examination x-ray abnormality suggestive active TB determine treat physician . Both smear positive ( PTB+ ) smear negative pulmonary ( PTB- ) patient recruited increase generalizability study . Pre-trial measure Interventions improve quality TB care Baseline study conduct determine quality TB diagnosis , patient care treatment outcome identify alternative option TB care appropriate local condition . Six month prior trial , limitation ongoing DOTS find study communicate district health office head , hospital director district TB expert order strengthen quality TB care management district TB program . Specific tool develop National Tuberculosis Program ( NTC ) ensure consistent application diagnostic criterion , patient counselling/health information , standard supervisory support , drug supply district evaluation prepared consultation district health management expert hospital director . Subsequently , district TB coordinator , health institution-based TB focal person clinician train patient diagnosis , patient care , community-based tuberculosis care study protocol . Based baseline assessment quality care , follow measure improve patient-centred care institute health facility level : 1 . Quality control measure improve quality diagnosis . 2 . Definition health information convey patient , 3 . Patient teach use one one interactive counselling method . 4 . Training health worker TB management ( TB focal person ) particular emphasis patient management , management drug side effect interpretation treatment outcome , report . 5 . Treatment patient ' convenient health facility . 6 . Provision daily patient TB service health facility . 7 . Continuous support health worker CHWs workable referral system . Tuberculosis treatment register translate local language modify fit monitoring interpretation treatment outcomes health facility level patient three treatment group . Volunteer CHWs also train nearby health institution TB focal person patient care , drug handling , indication referral , manage side effect , use patient adherence card . Quarterly supervisory support give regional expert district health office , health institution supervise monthly basis district TB coordinator . The nearby TB focal person provide technical support volunteer CHWs monthly meet respective health facility . Biannual evaluation district health staff HQ staff district health staff TB focal person institute . The implementation measure prior launch trial create 'operational condition ' component strategy recommend NTC International Union Tuberculosis Lung disease ( IUTL ) /WHO ( Wold Health Organisatio ) guideline . Strengthening health system base local condition assume basis determine specific need , create condition development necessary managerial technical skill effective implementation community-based TB care . Selection delivery option TB care Four prominent TB care delivery option identify community base survey : Volunteer CHWs , Public health worker , Self-administered treatment Family member . Further assessment regard reliability implication DOTS strategy make use follow selection criterion : 1 . Uninterrupted supply anti-TB drug patient could ensure , 2 . Quality care comparable prevailing health facility base TB care could institute , 3 . Accountability term guarantee proper use drug monthly reporting treatment outcomes patient public health system , 4 . Feasibility term cost apply large scale , 5 . Level acceptance local community determine cross-sectional study . In addition prevail health facility-based TB care , use volunteer CHWs self-administered treatment find appropriate option pilot test . Based criterion , care family member least operational feasibility cost involve family ( labour cost interruption daily activity transport cost ) health system ( health worker time cost training ) could high . Operational difficulty also anticipate set appropriate system monitor anti-TB drug use , provision health education , referral , monthly reporting treatment outcome particularly among family member could remote part region . The decentralization TB care community level use exist volunteer CHWs program anticipate feasible option institute component WHO-recommended DOTS strategy . Volunteer CHWs train patient care continuous basis . Accountability anti-TB drug use report treatment outcome obtain use exist link CHWs nearby public health facility . The service render appreciate respective community . The self-administered treatment option consider critical examination previous effectiveness study , patient ' convenience tuberculosis care , importantly , take account view express community patient . Operational challenge , health worker could force allow patient take treatment volunteer CHWs could offer TB care remote area also consider . Defining intervention arm The final step optimal quality TB care less inconvenience could reach among two alternative option patient ' perspective order achieve optimum treatment outcome target . These integrate intervention therefore target test treatment outcome institute comparable patient quality care patient convenience TB care among three strategy . In order three factor consider . 1 . Epidemiological factor From baseline study , patient interrupt treatment intensive phase treatment . But , occurrence death high first 2 month treatment . Even though contribution unknown Ethiopia , high HIV-TB co-morbidity mortality anti-TB therapy attribute sub-Saharan country . Thus , proper management health facility first 28 day patient assign volunteer CHW care self-administered group would ensure health care need . 2 . Operational factor The intervention design implemented operational condition district health system ongoing community-based volunteer CHW programme . CHWs get technical material support form nearby health facility . They require submit activity report facility monthly basis . This arrangement find effective maintaining functionality CHWs minimize disruption daily life . Given operational condition , patient manage nearby health facility first four week proper selection introduction respective CHWs make . Other operational factor favour arrangement include feasibility scale intervention , low time cost CHWs health system . This operational set anticipate enable TB focal person organize monthly evaluation session CHWs catchment . 3 . Ethical issue Health intervention safe minimize potential risk lead patient morbidity mortality . In Ethiopia significant proportion tuberculosis patient also infect HIV . The fact assign patient intervention whose effectiveness unknown ( volunteer CHWs ) allow die ( self-administer group ) also regard unethical . Interventions Accordingly , patient receive daily TB care include observe daily dos treatment first 28 day convenient health facility . Patients properly counsel illness manage accordingly TB focal person . Counselling conduct use standard procedure develop baseline study order ensure good quality tuberculosis care . They teach specifically cause prevention TB , side effect drug , treatment adherence schedule follow examination . During time , TB focal person need assist patient select volunteer CHWs village . They explain role create confidence . All eligible patient treat use anti-TB drug recommend national tuberculosis control Ethiopia . PTB+ patient receive weight adjust Ethambutol ( E ) , Rifampicin ( R ) , Isoniazid ( H ) Pyrazinamide ( Z ) first 8 week treatment follow 6 month EH , PTB- treat weight adjust RHZ two month , follow 6 month EH . Patients assign health worker-TB care group ( HW-TC ) follow per national TB guideline , i.e . daily care include observe treatment TB focal person , respective nearby health institution first 8 week follow self-administered treatment remain 6 month . During continuation phase patient expect visit nearby health facility every month follow . Supervisory support give TB focal person respective district TB coordinator monthly basis . Anti-TB drug deliver health institution quarterly basis district TB coordinator supervision . Patients assign volunteer CHW-TB care group ( CHW-TC ) daily TB care CHWs village second month follow monthly visit CHWs ' home remain 6 month self-administered treatment . Patients expect visit health facility end second month end treatment sputum examination . Technical support anti-TB drug give CHWs TB focal person every fortnight . Those assigned self-administered treatment group ( SA-TC ) take medication home seven month . They teach TB focal person collect anti-TB drug fortnightly report miss daily dos . Follow assessment continue support make TB focal person monthly basis nearby health facility . Patients also tell report encounter severe side effect . Procedures A randomized controlled design use compare exist HW-TC CHW-TC self-administered treatment . Eligible PTB+ PTB- patient assign use random number , computer generate statistician regional level . To avoid disproportionate allocation among treatment group two separate random block 3 PTB+ PTB- arrange . Two set sequentially number sealed envelope district prepare . Two separate box contain seal envelope PTB+ PTB- give head district health office . The district recruit officer obtain allocation arm patient district health office head . For district , allocation code use recorded weekly telephone . A statistician monitor quality assignment cross check original list research HQ sequence patient ' attendance recruitment . Recruiting officer train use pre-tested guideline prepare ensure standard procedure apply consistently screen inform patient . Written consent obtain every patient follow proper counselling , particular emphasis tuberculosis treatment alternative option care . Patients refuse randomly assign method TB care allow select either two remain care option . A request haemoglobin test every eligible patient make health facility TB focal person diagnostic health facility ( hospital health centre ) order collect serum anonymous HIV test patient send district recruit officer . Laboratory technician send 5 cc serum label cod system develop Regional Research Laboratory ( RRL ) HQ . HIV test ( Determine® HIV-1/2 , Abboti Laboratories ) result make available research team end trial . Baseline data collect eligible patient he/she refer convenient health facility . Patients identified code number order maintain confidentiality assignment . The code reveal study team preliminary data analysis draft reporting phase complete . Standard treatment outcome indicator develop WHO NTC use compare effectiveness strategy . Treatment outcome data collect team three tuberculosis expert involve study . Treatment outcome PTB+ patient assess sputum microscopy presence acid fast bacilli clinical improvement adherence treatment use assess outcome PTB- patient clinician . Cure treatment completion rate use compare treatment group . A patient declare cure confirmed sputum smear negative end treatment one month prior completion treatment least one previous occasion . A patient record `` treatment complete '' smear result available least two occasion negative pre-treatment result . A patient treatment least 4 week whose treatment interrupt 8 consecutive week cumulative period 12 week classify defaulter patient remain smear-positive 5 month later treatment consider failure . A patient start treatment least 4 week transfer another district record transfer . Statistical analysis The comparative effectiveness health workers-TB care volunteer CHW-TC SA-TC randomize control trial never report far . It hypothesize significant difference cure treatment completion rate among three care group would show , take prevail health facility-based TB care gold standard care . The sample size PTB+ ( 179 patient per arm ) plan detect least 10 % difference treatment success rate care group ( assume 85 % treatment success rate high arm baseline treatment success rate 72 % ) power 80 % significant level 5 % . With assumption ( 85 % treatment completion rate high arm baseline treatment completion rate 69 % ) , eligible PTB- patient ( 131 patient per arm ) also include study period . Separate comparison effectiveness three method TB care carry PTB+ PTB- patient . Comparison effectiveness care group undertake accord principle intention-to-treat . The strength association treatment outcomes care group determine use chi-square test . Adjusted effect patient ' characteristic , area residence , HIV status , time elapsed patient treatment , type health facility method TB care use treatment outcomes compute use logistic regression analysis .</detailed_description>
