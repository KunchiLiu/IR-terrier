	<brief_title>A6 Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess activity A6 , measure 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate objective tumor response ( complete partial ) rate , patient persistent recurrent ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma . II . To determine frequency severity adverse event assess CTCAE v3.0 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize duration PFS overall survival . II . To identify biomarkers drug effect peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore whether gene identify up- down-regulated exposure human PBMCs A6 vitro also up- down-regulated follow treatment patient A6 vivo . II . To explore whether association expression candidate A6 receptor tumor prior treatment A6 ( determine IHC ) response PFS . III . To explore whether association change expression candidate biomarkers PBMCs 0-24 hour follow first dose A6 response PFS . IV . To explore whether association change expression candidate biomarkers PBMCs course first one month cycle ( course 1 ) response PFS . V. To determine whether association plasma A6 level measure day 2 ( 24 hour first dose 4 hour second dose ) 8 ( prior injection A6 ) course 1 level expression candidate biomarkers PBMCs collect day . VI . To explore whether association plasma A6 level measure day 2 ( 24 hour first dose 4 hour second dose ) 8 ( prior injection A6 ) course 1 response PFS . VII . To explore whether association candidate serum biomarkers response PFS course A6 treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive A6 subcutaneously daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
