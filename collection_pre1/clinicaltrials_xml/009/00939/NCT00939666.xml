	<criteria>18 year old Patients primary rectal cancer without distant metastasis underwent CRT show clinical complete response good response : Clinical complete response ( ycT0N0 ) good response ( ycT12N0 ) preoperative chemoradiation determine clinically ( digital rectal examination , endoscopy ) , radiologically ( contrastenhancedMRI ) pathologically ( biopsy ) Informed consent capability give informed consent Comprehension alternative strategy concept unknown risk clear patient ( word patient understand experimental base study ) . Recurrent rectal cancer . Distant metastasis . Unable unwilling comply intensive followup schedule . Contraindications MRI . If MRI possible contraindication ( e.g . pacemaker ) exclude patient . MRI crucial response evaluation followup omit patient follow alternative strategy ( 'waitandsee policy ' TEM ) .</criteria>
