	<brief_summary>The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RNYGB ) weight loss surgery involve creation small gastric pouch rearrangement small intestine . Although RNYGB demonstrate effective bariatric procedure , significant number patient experience weight regain often associate distend gastric anatomy . Open laparoscopic approach revision associate high complication rate de novo procedure . This study evaluate safety effectiveness revisional incisionless natural orifice surgery gastric pouch stoma produce weight loss post-RNYGB patient experience weight regain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>StomaphyX Versus Sham Revisional Surgery Post-Roux-en-Y Patients Reduce Regained Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RNYGB ) commonly perform bariatric procedure treat morbid obesity 1 . Numerous study document effectiveness RNYGB promote excess weight loss ( EWL ) typically 65-80 % range 1.5 2 year 1 . Despite favorable short-term outcome bariatric surgical procedure , approximately 10-40 % patient achieve successful long-term weight loss 2 . The weight regain occur typically within 2 7 year RNYGB surgery associate primarily dilation gastric pouch stoma 3 , 4 . Several open laparoscopic bariatric revision procedure use attempt correct dilation , associate serious complication perforation , obstruction , staple line disruption , blind loop syndrome , stoma ulcer , incisional hernia 2 , 5 , 6 . Because high rate morbidity associate revisional gastric bypass surgery , less invasive endoscopic procedure may become preferred approach weight regain RNYGB 7 , 8 . The StomaphyX delivery system SerosaFuse fastener consist ergonomic , flexible fastener delivery device sterile polypropylene fastener implant . The unit provide sterile single use device . The polypropylene fastener proprietary function StomaphyX device . The device use vacuum invaginate tissue port chamber fasten use H shape polypropylene fastener . The fastener delivery subsystem comprise 3 element : stylet , pusher , internal lumen . They run length device , pusher hollow tube ride length stylet , rid lumen . The stylet sharp distal tip pierce tissue . The fastener load snap onto stylet load port handle . When push operator , stylet carry fastener lumen run proximal handle assembly distal tissue port eventually deploy tissue . Durability SerosaFuse fastener demonstrate several clinical study utilize EsophyX device 9-12 . Reason Conducting Present Study : The goal study investigate safety effectiveness StomaphyX device revisional natural orifice surgery gastric pouch gastrojejunostomy anastomosis ( stoma ) RNYGB patient reduce regain weight .</detailed_description>
