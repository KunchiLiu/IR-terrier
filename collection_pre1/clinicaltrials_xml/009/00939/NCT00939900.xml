	<brief_title>Efficacy Zoledronic Acid Preventing Collapse Osteonecrotic Femoral Head</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Until , best treatment option early ( precollapse ) large osteonecrosis femoral head vascularize fibular graft . However , require high microsurgical technique . Also need long operation time ( 3-6hours ) , morbidity associate surgery low . In early stage osteonecrosis , osteoclast activate resorb necrotic portion bone osteoblasts follow lay new bone . This process weaken bone function support load lead collapse bone . Bisphophonate inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption enhance osteoblastic new bone formation . Recently , everyday oral intake alendronate vitamin D calcium high success rate prevent collapse decrease hip joint pain short-term follow-up . However , compliance adherence everyday oral intake questionable . Moreover , exact comparison base MRI accord various classification available currently . There report effect zoledronic acid prevent early collapse progression joint dome depression ( ≥2 mm X-ray ) early stage large nontraumatic osteonecrosis femoral head effect MRI signal change infusion zoledronic acid noncollapsed case ( estimate 30 % case ) The investigator need control randomized multicenter interventional study efficacy bisphophonates treatment ONFH .</detailed_description>
