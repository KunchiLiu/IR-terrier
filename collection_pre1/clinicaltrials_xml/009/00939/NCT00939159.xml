	<brief_title>Study LBH589 Patients With Low Intermediate-1 Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug : LBH589 drug may slow growth cancer cell kill cancer cell block certain enzyme ( protein produce cell ) . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take LBH589 capsule mouth 3 time week 3 week ( example Days 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10,12 , 15 , 17 , 19 ) 1 week rest 28-day study `` cycle . '' You take LBH589 time morning . Each dose LBH589 take 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You swallow capsule whole chew . You must eat grapefruit Seville ( sour ) oranges drink juice entire participation study . If vomit take LBH589 , wait next schedule dose take another capsule . If forget take capsule morning , take 12 hour usual time take . After 12 hour , take LBH589 day . Instead , wait next schedule dose . Do make missed dos . Call study doctor study staff soon possible unusual symptom . Do wait next visit tell doctor symptom . If side effect assign dose level , dose may lower . You may also stop take LBH589 short period , side effect ( ) watch doctor resolve . Take drug doctor tell . Do miss capsule . You ask return study drug bottle provide , whether take capsule . Empty bottle also bring back clinic . Capsules transfer bottle time . At visit , must tell study staff drug take study . This include prescription drug , over-the-counter drug , vitamin . Your study doctor tell need stop take drug . Study Visits : At least every week Cycle 1 every cycle , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . On Day 21 ( +/- 7 day ) Cycle 1 , bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . On Days 1 5 Cycle 1 , Days 5 22 Cycles 2 beyond , ECGs . If doctor think necessary , may ECGs often . On Day 1 Cycle 2 beyond EKG prior take study medication . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 24 month . You take study intolerable side effect occur disease get bad . End Study Visit : When stop take LBH589 , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test - You bone marrow aspiration biopsy check status disease . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You performance status evaluation . - You ECG . This investigational study . LBH589 FDA approve commercially available . At time , LBH589 use research . Up 40 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
