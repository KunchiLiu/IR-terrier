	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine high-dose cyclophosphamide follow maintenance dose glatiramer acetate safe patient relapse remit multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The investigator hypothesize institution glatiramer acetate treatment follow high-dose cyclophosphamide treatment extend period disease free activity reduce disability patient relapse remit multiple sclerosis . The investigator plan investigate property glatiramer acetate recurrence MS disease activity follow high dose cyclophosphamide induce cessation detectable autoimmunity . The investigator hypothesize glatiramer acetate , give phase immune reconstitution high-dose cyclophosphamide , may bias immune system tolerate state , thus lead stable potentially permanent remission .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) autoimmune disease characterized progressive immune-mediated destruction myelin axon within CNS . Despite development , approval clinical utilization several medicine patient MS , patient continue accrue progressive disability . High-dose cyclophosphamide chemotherapy treatment option severe , refractory , immune-mediated illness MS . There grow evidence high dose cyclophosphamide well tolerate effective MS. Our experience 9 patient underwent treatment Johns Hopkins Hospital yield impressive result significant 40 % reduction baseline disability 81 % reduction MRI gadolinium enhance lesion . Five 9 patient recurrence new brain MRI lesions 24 month follow-up , recur 4 patient first year follow-up . Our finding suggest high-dose cyclophosphamide hold promise inducing remission reduce disability relapse remit MS however recurrence MS disease activity ( evidence worsen disability , clinical exacerbation ongoing MRI evidence new lesion ) suggest high-dose cyclophosphamide give treatment , sufficient induce long-term remission . Glatiramer acetate show general suppressor autoimmune disease , inhibit onset experimental animal model uveoretinitis , rheumatoid arthritis , immune rejection graft host host graft disease , inflammatory bowel disease . Glatiramer acetate originally develop base observation inhibit onset clinical disease animal model multiple sclerosis , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) . Glatiramer acetate suppression EAE find general phenomenon restrict particular specie , disease type encephalitogen use induction EAE . A unique feature glatiramer acetate promiscuous bind high affinity various class II MHC molecule potent induction Th2 regulatory T cell . Moreover glatiramer acetate subsequently show general suppressor autoimmune disease , inhibit onset experimental uveoretinitis , immune rejection graft host host graft disease , experimental inflammatory bowel disease . We plan investigate property glatiramer acetate recurrence MS disease activity follow high dose cyclophosphamide induce cessation detectable autoimmunity . This study prospective , open-label two-year follow-up study 12 patient relapsing-remitting MS unable tolerate fail optimally respond conventional therapy high risk disease progression loss function . Patients elect enter study give single course high-dose , cyclophosphamide regimen without transplantation . Patients receive 20 mg glatiramer acetate subcutaneously 4 6 week last dose high-dose cyclophosphamide , allow immune system time begin reconstitute without glatiramer acetate still provide sufficient time glatiramer acetate vaccinate recurrence MS disease activity . The primary outcome pilot study determine high follow maintenance dose glatiramer acetate safe patient population . We hypothesize institution glatiramer acetate treatment follow high-dose cyclophosphamide treatment extend period disease free activity reduce disability patient relapse remit MS .</detailed_description>
