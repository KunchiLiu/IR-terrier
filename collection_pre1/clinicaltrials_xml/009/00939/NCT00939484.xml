	<brief_title>Vismodegib Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Medulloblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate efficacy GDC-0449 ( vismodegib ) treatment adult patient recurrent refractory medulloblastoma , measure objective response rate patient without ( Stratum A ) ( Stratum B ) evidence activation Sonic Hedgehog ( SHH ) signal pathway tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability GDC-0449 administer daily schedule . II . To estimate duration objective response progression-free survival ( PFS ) . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics ( plasma cerebrospinal fluid ) GDC-0449 adult refractory medulloblastoma . IV . To document pathologic genomic method identify CNS tumor activation PTCH/SHH pathway . V. To describe objective response observe patient whose pathologic assessment tumor result unknown ( Stratum C ) evidence activation Sonic Hedgehog ( SHH ) signal pathway tumor . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord PTCH/Sonic Hedgehog signal pathway activation ( inactivated v activate vs unknown ) . Patients receive vismodegib orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 26 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 12 month .</detailed_description>
