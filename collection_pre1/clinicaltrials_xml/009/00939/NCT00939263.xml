	<brief_summary>Eosinophilic Esophagitis ( EoE ) chronic inflammatory disease esophagus affect child adult . The frequent symptom swallow difficulty thoracic pain . The disease first describe 1980s find rapidly increase frequency mainly industrialized country . The factor lead EoE incompletely understand , importance , disease find frequently men patient suffer allergic disease ( e.g. , Asthma ) . So far exist activity index define severity EoE ; index urgently need future clinical trial determine efficacy current future therapy . The investigator ' 3-year project , carry cooperation international EoE expert , aim development activity index adult pediatric EoE patient used future clinical trial well observational study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development , Validation Evaluation Adult Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis Activity Index</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : 1 . Introduction Coordinated Swiss Eosinophilic Esophagitis Research Group close collaboration The International Gastrointestinal Eosinophil Researchers ( TIGERS ) , plan conduct series relate study order develop Activity Index ( AI ) adult pediatric patient Eosinophilic Esophagitis ( EoE ) . EoE emerge disease , rapidly grow clinical relevance research activity . A validated assessment instrument therefore urgently need . The purpose project develop within representative group pediatric adult EoE-experienced gastroenterologist EoE-experienced pathologist AI chronic inflammatory esophageal disease . The project investigator initiate , fund different source necessary . The project conduct compliance protocol , ICH guideline E6 Good Clinical Practice , FDA perspectives patient-reported outcome support medical product label claim ( 1,2 ) , applicable regulatory requirement . As EoE new disorder include comprehensive description disease . 1.1 . Characterization Eosinophilic Esophagitis Definition : EoE rapidly emerge distinctive disorder pediatric adult gastroenterology . EoE chronic-inflammatory esophageal disease , characterize clinicopathologically presence esophagus-related symptom dense esophageal eosinophilia , persist despite prolonged treatment proton pump inhibitor ( 3 ) . Epidemiology : EoE diagnose 2-3 time frequently males female . The disease find mainly industrialized country United States , Canada , Europe Australia . EoE likely 'young ' disease : see prior early 1980 , strong evidence suggest prevalence increase ( 4 ) ( 5 ) . A population-based study perform Switzerland suggest increase prevalence 2 per 100000 40 per 100000 inhabitant 19-year period ( 6 ) . Clinical Symptoms : As many disease , symptom presentation differs significantly child adult . In infant toddler , food refusal common symptom EoE . Children often suffer GERD-like symptom , vomit abdominal pain . Dysphagia food impaction report increasingly proceeding age . Adolescents adults present mostly dysphagia solid food impaction ( 5-7 ) . Endoscopy/Histology : Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy ( EGD ) first diagnostic step evaluation individual suspect EoE . A broad spectrum endoscopic feature associate EoE describe , endoscopic suspicion need confirmation histology . The key diagnostic criterion diagnose EoE increase number intraepithelial eosinophils patient lack responsiveness high-dose proton pump inhibition normal pH-monitoring distal esophagus . In consensus conference cut-off value =15 Eos/HPF ( peak eosinophilic count 400 fold magnification ) biopsy recommend diagnostic criterion ( 3 ) . Treatment : The optimal treatment EoE yet clear , experience limit largely case series small controlled trial . So far topically systemically administer corticosteroid , several type allergen-reduced diet , immunosuppressant IL-5 block agent show efficacious ( 8-11 ) . 1.2 . Rationale plan Studies In clinical set current status give disease often report `` mild '' , `` moderate '' `` severe '' , course disease time describe term `` stable '' , `` progressive '' , `` remission '' `` flare-up '' . None term far clearly define EoE . However , increase number phase 3 therapeutic multi-center trial natural history study patient EoE perform near future . In order set standardize study protocol compare result different study standardize definition disease activity necessity . Taken together , clinical research purpose indispensable define term mention suitable , reproducible validate score , reflect disease activity precisely possible . The necessity score repeatedly discuss TIGERS underscore several publication ( 12 ) . Objective The planned research program aim develop validate AI EoE ( EEsAI ) adult ( adEEsAI ) pediatric ( pedEEsAI ) patient , use future clinical trial observational study . According characterization EoE , AI likely contain clinical histopathological item . Laboratory endoscopical parameter may part score , subsidiary role . Methods : The development validation disease activity index research program involve several related study . Broadly speak , involve 3 main step : Step I Item Generation Reduction Delphi process international expert group ( Development phase A ) . Step II Item Weighting Activity Index Derivation , use data first cohort adult first cohort pediatric patient ( Development phase B ) . Step III Evaluation Activity Index use data second independent cohort adult pediatric patient respectively . This involve also assessment test-retest reliability responsiveness score , use longitudinal data patient .</detailed_description>
