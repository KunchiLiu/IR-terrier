	<brief_summary>As result previous NCRN study ( ABC-02 ) cisplatin gemcitabine ( CisGem ) likely become international standard care patient advance biliary tract cancer ( submit : ASCO 2009 ) . This study , ABC-03 , determine whether addition cediranib ( oral Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor inhibitor ) CisGem improve time disease progression patient group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cediranib Versus Placebo Plus Cisplatin/Gemcitabine Chemotherapy Patients With Advanced Biliary Tract Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although currently standard chemotherapy patient advance biliary tract cancer ( ABC ) UK ABC-02 study ( large study far patient group , n=410 ) likely define CisGem global standard care disease base significantly improve progression-free survival overall survival compare gemcitabine alone . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) pivotal stimulus physiologic pathologic angiogenesis , include sustain neo-vascularisation required support solid tumour growth . Human biliary tract carcinoma cell high expression VEGF cell line tissue ( detect 75.6 % 33 resected clinical specimen ) associate significantly high level microvessel density presence intrahepatic metastasis . Cediranib highly potent inhibitor VEGF receptor 2 tyrosine kinase VEGF-induced signal endothelial cell . It safely combine CisGem regimen lung cancer patient . Aims This trial aim evaluate effect progression-free survival cediranib combination CisGem chemotherapy compare CisGem placebo . Summary study Consenting patient ABC ( inoperable , locally advanced , recurrent metastatic ) receive CisGem chemotherapy either cediranib ( experimental arm ) placebo ( standard arm ) orally . Treatment continue disease progression ( chemotherapy stop 24 week ) tumour reassessment CT/MRI scan 12-weekly interval . All patient follow survival analysis .</detailed_description>
