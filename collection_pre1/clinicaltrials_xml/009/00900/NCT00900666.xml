	<brief_summary>Stiff knee gait common gait dysfunction follow acquire brain injury . This gait deviation characterize reduced knee flexion swing phase gait cycle adversely impact safe foot clearance . Stiff knee gait inefficient gait pattern slow walk speed , limit one 's ability adapt walk community mobility demand . Fall risk increase gait problem due low ineffective foot clearance . Common compensatory strategy employ , circumduction , hip hike vaulting , ambulation . The purpose study examine immediate ( one month post-injection ) longer-term ( 4 month post-injection ) effect botulinum toxin injection rectus femoris ( RF ) gait function person brain injury . This study clinically important help inform rehabilitation professional regard treatment decision management inefficient often unsafe stiff knee gait problem follow brain injury . Research Questions : - Is statistically significant difference mean peak knee flexion experimental control group ? - Is statistically significant difference mean peak knee velocity preswing initial swing phase gait experimental control group ? - Is statistically significant difference gait function ( base 6-Minute Walk time temporal distance measure ) experimental control group ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pathophysiologic factor may contribute stiff knee gait person brain injury muscle hypertonicity quadriceps muscle , hip flexor weakness , activity gastrocsoleus muscle terminal stance ( 1 ) . Kerrigan et al ( 2 ) report hyperactivity Rectus Femoris ( RF ) swing phase key contributor dynamic swing phase deficit adult spastic paresis . Overactivity RF muscle early swing phase also identify major contributor stiff knee gait dysfunction child cerebral palsy ( 3 ) . Recognition role RF over-activity stiff knee gait cerebral palsy population lead surgical medical intervention aim minimize constraint swing phase mechanic , RF transfer , RF release , Botulinum toxin injection ( BTX-A ) ( 4,5 ) . Research cerebral palsy population support application intervention improve knee flexion swing phase improve overall gait function efficiency ( 6 ) . The applicability direct intervention stiff knee gait , particularly less invasive BTX-A injection RF , well examine adult spastic paresis . Two research group ( 7,8 ) examine immediate effect motor branch block RF person post-stroke stiff knee gait report improved maximum knee flexion mean knee flexion velocity preswing swing phase follow block . Very studies9,10 date examine short-term effect BTX-A injection RF gait function energy cost walk person post-stroke ambulate stiff knee gait . Stoquart colleagues9 find two month follow BTX-A injection , subject improve maximum knee flexion swing phase improve knee flexion velocity toe . Energy cost improve subset subject great 10 degree knee flexion swing phase prior BTX-A injection . The result prospective observational study provide initial support efficacy BTX-A intervention stiff knee gait adult post-stroke , however , author examine short-term effect intervention ( 9 ) . Also , study limitation methodology , gait function pre- post-BOTOX® intervention assess use automate treadmill oppose gait analysis overground walk self select gait speed . Further research need determine longer-term benefit BTX-A injection RF gait function brain injury population . Research Design : - Double-blind randomize control trial - Subjects randomly assign experimental control group - The experimental group receive BTX-A injection rectus femoris ( RF ) follow usual care - The control group receive saline injection RF follow usual care - Subjects researcher blind group assignment - Three-dimensional computerized gait assessment conduct pre-treatment ( within 2 week prior BOTOX®/placebo injection ) , 1 month post 4 month post-injection</detailed_description>
