	<brief_summary>The aim study prospectively document incidence CM adverse reaction time ERCP determine whether various perceive risk factor predictive adverse reaction . Adverse reaction iodine contain contrast medium ( CM ) describe endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography ( ERCP ) difficult study due extremely low incidence . Adverse reaction classify severity ( mild , moderate severe ) underlie mechanism ( idiosyncratic versus nonidiosyncratic ) . Nonidiosyncratic reaction relate dose osmolality CM ; observe ERCP due relative small amount systemic absorption CM . Idiosyncratic reaction hand dose-dependent generally occur shortly administration CM . Premedication corticosteroid , H1/H2 -blockers use low osmolality CM beneficial preventing nonidiosyncratic reaction intravascular administration . However role ERCP unclear CM inject intravascular space . Currently formal recommendation clinical practice varies considerably . The general purpose study determine incidence CM reaction ERCP determine whether various risk factor predictive idiosyncratic reaction . Based result , hope develop guideline use prophylaxis prevent CM reaction ERCP .</brief_summary>
