	<brief_summary>Nasopharyngeal ( NP ) colonization S. pneumoniae infant generally acquire approximately 4-6 month age . Although difference prevalence rank order serotypes obtain NP specimen invasive disease , pneumococcal nasopharyngeal isolates may reflect strain circulate community may use marker predict serotype prevalence invasive disease resistance pattern . The information pneumococcal strain find Jordanian child NP-carriage infant limit include child live rural region . Monitoring serotype distribution essential appropriate application vaccination . Vaccine use infant prove highly efficacious prevention invasive pneumococcal disease well decrease carriage vaccine serotypes nasopharynx infant impact significantly long run otitis medium infection help decrease infection rate among contact infant . The result decrease pneumococcal infection rate among elderly contact infant decrease colonization pneumococcus . In order determine pneumococcal serotypes prevalent among infant attend day care center ( DCCs ) Jordan , study type circulate among infant determine period 15 month 250-300 child attend DCCs Ajlun-City take 3 NP-swabs , first first vaccine injection May 2009 , second third injection 10 month age third swab sample take 1 year age ( 2-3 month last injection 7vPCV . The aim study determine frequency NP-carriage serotype distribution strain isolate infant less 2 year old , get insight coverage available future pneumococcal conjugate vaccine develop infectious agent . Good result study project would make recommendation Ministry Health ( MOH ) include vaccine National Vaccination Program . 15000 dos 7v PCV ( Prevenar ) donate Wyeth Pharmaceutical company MOH Jordan September 2008 . These vaccinated vaccine program ( free ) 15 month period 2009-2010 one city north Jordan call Ajlun . This city 3676 birth per year ( Statistics MOH 2007 ) . The vaccination program start 18th May , 2009 , end August 2010 . The way vaccine give 2 + 1 injection recommend vaccination committee MOH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>S. pneumoniae one major bacterial cause invasive disease , community acquire pneumonia respiratory tract infection worldwide ( Song , Oh et al . 2008 ) . It cause meningitis , bacteraemia , otitis medium , pneumonia infection . The resistance rate bacteria antibiotics world increase mortality rate globally reach 2 million every year report WHO . Risk group mainly young child 5 year age , immune-deficient patient elderly . There 91 different serotypes infectious agent know worldwide . In United States America Europe , research S. pneumonia show 70-85 % S. pneumoniae case cover prevented 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( Prevenar ( 7v-PCV ) ) . This percentage different accord country . In Jordan , vaccine introduce license January 2006 without previous preliminary study serotypes capsular type find . Furthermore , publish data infection cause Streptococcus pneumonia Jordan . The total number Jordanian population estimate 2007 5,744 million inhabitant birth rate 28 per 1000 people concentrated capital Amman ( 1.781 million ) , Irbid ( 629679 ) Zarqa ( 819000 ) . Of Jordanian inhabitant accord WHO recent number 2008 , 37.1 % child 15 year age 3.8 % 65 year age , total child 5 year estimate 2007 917000 . This mean people risk pneumococcal infection 40.9 % total population . Furthermore , statistical data MOH report increase non-meningococcal meningitis case ( without specification exact cause meningitis ) 438 case ( incidence 10.2/ 100,000 population ) 1995 778 case ( incidence 14.5/ 100,000 population ) 2007 . In 2005 , 458 cases/ 747 case ( 61 % ) Irbid city alone -north- ; 460 case 2007 778 case non meningococcal meningitis . The maximum number case non-meningococcal meningitis report year 2000 ( 1108 case incidence rate 22/ 100,000 ) , 2003 ( 1079 case incidence rate 19.7/ 100,000 ) . In 2007 , 778 case report Jordan non-meningococcal meningitis , 140 case Amman 490 Irbid alone rest part Jordan . If consider know 30 % infection ( non-meningococcal meningitis ) due S. pneumonia . This mean 233 case S. pneumonia meningitis report annually 147 Irbid 42 case Amman make 189 case ( 81 % pneumococcal meningitis Jordan occur Irbid Amman ) . Many factor identify promote clonal spread multiresistant strain ; place high density child DCC orphanage . S. pneumonia , resistant many antimicrobial agent . Extensive often excessive use antibiotic promote replacement strain susceptible antimicrobial agent resistant one ( Garcia-Rodriguez Fresnadillo Martinez 2002 ) , ( Pradier , Dunais et al . 1997 ) . Despite adequate antibiotic treatment , morbidity mortality due pneumococcal disease remain high ( Butler , Shapiro et al . 1999 ) . Moreover , increase multidrug resistance among pneumococcal isolates hamper adequate treatment ( Crook Spratt 1998 ) , ( Klugman 1996 ) , ( Tomasz 1997 ) . These strain subsequently disseminate community contact colonize child , e.g. , sibling parent . It possible limit spread serotypes S. pneumoniae vaccination , study impact immunization colonization yield discrepant result ( Dagan , Givon-Lavi et al . 2002 ) , ( Dagan , Melamed et al . 1996 ) , ( Dagan , Muallem et al . 1997 ) , ( Mbelle , Huebner et al . 1999 ) . New pneumococcal conjugate vaccine show effective invasive disease young child ( Black , Shinefield et al . 2000 ) . Furthermore , protective effect respiratory tract infection ( recurrent ) otitis medium observe ( Black , Shinefield et al . 2000 ) , ( Eskola , Kilpi et al . 2001 ) . Thus far , 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Prevenar ( Wyeth ) approve U.S. Food Drug Administration European Committee Proprietary Medicinal Products recommend U.S . Advisory Committee Immunization Practices prevention invasive diseases child 2 year age . Recommendations also make old child increase risk invasive disease , human immunodeficiency virus infection asplenia increase risk pneumococcal mucosal disease , child recurrent acute otitis medium . The effect 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine follow 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine child age 1 7 year history recurrent acute otitis medium study ( Veenhoven , Bogaert et al . 2003 ) . Clinically , protective effect pneumococcal vaccine recurrence acute otitis medium find . At nasopharyngeal level , however , significant reduction colonization vaccine-type pneumococcus find vaccination , whereas simultaneous increase colonization non vaccine serotypes observe ( Veenhoven , Bogaert et al . 2003 ) , ( van der Linden , Al-Lahham et al . 2007 ) . The spread non-vaccine 19A penicillin resistant pneumococcal strain USA serious development indeed , child treat levofloxacin one become partially deaf . With widespread Prevenar use Jordan clone might appear ( Pichichero Casey 2007 ; Pichichero Casey 2007 ) . Recently , Ph D study Jordan show resistance penicillin G S. pneumoniae isolate healthy child kindergarten reach 92 % . The efficacy 7v PCV define disease burden develop country study . SIGNIFICANCE OF WORK This research project many dimension include follow : - The research project would give idea effect vaccine give child , whether would affect incidence IPD indirectly city Ajlun compare others . - As result first point , governmental National program vaccination child take place Jordanian child specific age - In addition , resistance pattern isolate 14 different antibiotic develop . High resistance rate indicate treatment antibiotic efficient must use alternative treatment . A precise result antibiotic resistance pattern could save money prescribe antibiotic safe effective , would educate Jordanian population well use antimicrobial . - Furthermore , Serotyping S. pneumoniae isolate pneumococcal strain isolate study would give idea coverage vaccine available would answer family question shall vaccinate child ! ! Why pay 85 JDs privately vaccine since coverage le 50 % example . Here come question whether use 13 va , lent vaccine type , still development . Carriage S. pneumoniae Jordan pediatrics 5 develop primary result carriage Jordan 57 % . carriage distribution Jordanian population specific serotypes , include 7-vPCV , vaccination would best idea prevent occurrence infection decrease morbidity later mortality rate due infection pathogen . The northern Jordan constitute 50 % non-meningococcal infection . - An appropriate vaccination program specific area and/or specific age group Jordan might decrease distribution disease turn save money . - The result obtain insight effect pneumococcal conjugate vaccine genetic pneumococcal population structure . - The research finding later improve quality different private governmental laboratory Jordan personal contact advise . By apply bioinformatics phylogeny data resistance , serotyping Multilocus Sequence Typing ( MLST ) , global clonal relationship strain obtain data . Study Design : A 15 month surveillance study Nasopharyngeal Carriage Antibiotic Resistance S. pneumoniae Healthy Jordanian Infants launch Jordan ( Ajlun ) time period May 2009 August 2010 . Children give 7vPCV 3rd , 5th 10th month age ( two plus one scheme ) . Nasopharyngeal swab collect DCCs Ajlun . Questionnaires special form take isolate send reference lab German-Jordanian University isolation pneumococcus , identification , serotyping , resistance molecular analysis , statistical analysis coverage . Agreement Ministry Health ( MOH ) , take ethical point regard sample collection consideration guarantee . The sample cultivate microbiology lab German-Jordanian University . Molecular method investigate Germany National Reference Center Streptococci . Phases project implementation collection sample , identification . Culture identification : Samples inoculate Columbia agar plate 5 % sheep blood . The plate incubate 35°C 5 % CO2 overnight . Identification perform conventional microbiological method like colony morphology , susceptibility optochin ( bioMérieux ) , bile solubility . Susceptibility testing : Minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) test perform use broth micro broth dilution method recommend Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI ) ( CLSI 2008 ) . Antibiotics use Penicillin G , Amoxicillin , Cefotaxime , Cefuroxim , Cefpodoxim , Clarithromycin , Clindamycin , Tetracycline , Levofloxacin , Telithromycin , Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole , Chloramphenicole , Vancomycin might include possible new antibiotic upon request Tigecycline . S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 include control strain . Analysis resistance determinant ( Geno- phenotyping ) : PCR macrolide resistance determinant perform describe previously ( Reinert , Lütticken et al . 2003 ; Reinert 2004 ; Reinert , Jacobs et al . 2005 ) . For classical detection erm ( B ) mef ( A ) . Serotyping : Pneumococcal strain serotyped Neufeld 's Quellung reaction use type factor serum provide Statens Serum Institut , Copenhagen , Denmark . Subject Population Included : All November 2008 newborn Ajlun city ( ca 3676/year ) - equal 250-300 child/month include vaccination program time period 1.04.2009 28.04.2009 Nasopharyngeal swab first dose PCV-7 second swab third dose 12th month age , third swab 3 month third dose . Swabs send reference lab German-Jordanian University identification , serotyping , resistance testing . Number Subjects per Study Group ( applicable ) : 250-300 infant . Birth cohort Ajlun 3676/year represent 250-300 child/month . The study conduct newborn Jan 2009 come vaccination third month age . Primary Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : The frequency NP carriage , serotype distribution antimicrobial resistance pattern strain infant less 2 year old attend daily care center , live rural area . As truly efficacy project , determination assessment reduction vaccine type pneumococcal carriage result vaccination , project model impact routine program 7v PCV base serotype coverage country . know documented effectiveness country use schedule , since well know 7v PCV prevent . Rate resistant strain . Statistical Considerations : Statistical analysis do completion project , epidemiological statistic include : Calculate percentage Nasopharyngeal Carriage vaccine type non vaccine type time isolation newborn , resistance antibiotic ( percentage resistance , MIC50 , MIC90 range ) : demographic analysis age , sex , others like presence child within house attend school , socio-economical level , antibiotic use last 30 day , sleep room- alone sibling presence smoker house .
