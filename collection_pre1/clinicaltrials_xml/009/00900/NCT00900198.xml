	<brief_summary>Background : -Patients evaluate research protocol NIH Clinical Center participate site enter onto screen tissue procurement protocol collection tissue specimen . Objectives : -To obtain sample research purpose test perform clinical indication research indication research protocol , obtain sample research purpose non-surgical procedure , perform sole purpose obtain sample protocol . Eligibility : -Patients evaluate and/or treat protocol within NIH Clinical Center participate site . Design : - Specimens research purpose , outline protocol , obtain test procedure do required primary research protocol give patient enrol . - These procedure may include , limited , laboratory test blood , CSF , urine specimen ; needle biopsy . - Given risk associated procedure , procedure discuss detail patient , include side effect , prior obtain separate consent procedure . - Tissues biological fluid procure may include limited blood , serum , urine , tumor tissue , normal tissue , pleural fluid , CSF , saliva , bronchial alveolar lavage ( BAL ) , bone marrow . These specimen store without patient identifier use perform research study outline protocol . Patients opt donate sample create preclinical model study tumor biology genetics , develop new therapy cancer . Once patient take study , may re-consented enrolled late time obtain another research specimen part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : -Patients evaluate and/or treat NIH Clinical Center participate site enter onto tissue procurement protocol collection tissue specimen . Objectives : - To obtain sample research purpose test perform clinical &amp; research indication research protocol . - To obtain sample research purpose non-surgical procedure , percutaneous biopsy , perform sole purpose obtain tissue specimens biological fluid protocol . Eligibility : -Patients evaluate and/or treated cancer NIH Clinical Center participate site . Design : - This multicenter tissue procurement protocol NCI coordinating center . - Specimens research purpose , outline protocol , obtain test procedure do required primary research protocol give patient enrol . - Non-surgical procedure , percutaneous biopsy , may also perform sole purpose obtain tissue specimens biological fluid protocol . - Given risk associate invasive procedure , tumor biopsy , procedure discuss detail patient , include side effect , prior obtain separate consent procedure . A separate consent sign prior obtain sample minimally invasive measure , venipuncture . - Tissues biological fluid procure may include limited blood , serum , urine , tumor tissue , normal tissue , pleural fluid , CSF , saliva , bronchial alveolar lavage ( BAL ) , circulate tumor cell , hair follicle , bone marrow . These specimen store unique identifier use perform research study outline protocol . - This study two separate consent form NIH : patient NIH Clinical Center opt donate sample ongoing research assay development study pathway . In addition , patient opt donate sample create preclinical model study tumor biology genetics , develop new therapy cancer . Patients enrol onto protocol participate site donate specimen ( tumor , blood ) creation preclinical model study tumor biology genetics , develop new therapy cancer . - Patients may remain study duration consent .</detailed_description>
