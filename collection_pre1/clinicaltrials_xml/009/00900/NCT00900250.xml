	<brief_title>Collecting Storing Biological Samples From Young Patients With Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Establish biologic specimen repository ( tumor tissue , tissue array , lymphoblastoid cell line , host DNA , tumor host RNA , serum , plasma ) database link clinical feature outcomes well-characterized cohort child young adult Hodgkin 's lymphoma . II . Provide specimens diagnosis , early response evaluation , completion chemotherapy radiotherapy , long-term follow , relapse study prognostic factor early response , relapse , long-term outcome , identification new biological target therapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients enrol Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HL ) therapeutic clinical trial undergo collection tumor tissue sample baseline relapse disease progression . Serum anticoagulated peripheral blood sample collect baseline , week 1 , day 1 course 2 , completion chemotherapy , completion radiotherapy , 1 year diagnosis , relapse disease progression . Patients relapse progressive disease plan enroll HL relapse/retrieval clinical trial undergo collection tumor tissue , serum , anticoagulated peripheral blood sample relapse disease progression . Patients enrol 1 year completion treatment undergo collection tumor specimen , serum , anticoagulated peripheral blood sample time clinical evaluation .</detailed_description>
