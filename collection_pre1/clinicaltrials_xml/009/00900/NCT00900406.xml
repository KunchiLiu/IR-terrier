	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Collecting store sample blood , urine , tissue patient undergo donor stem cell transplant test laboratory may help study graft-versus-host disease future . PURPOSE : This research study collect store tissue DNA sample patient undergo donor stem cell transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collecting Storing Tissue DNA Samples From Patients Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To establish DNA bank donor recipient ( prior transplant ) peripheral blood SNP study . - To establish tissue bank gene expression study use donor recipient ( post-transplant ) peripheral blood sample . - To establish tissue bank proteomic study use donor recipient blood urine sample . - To establish tissue bank various study use biopsy specimen . - To establish tissue bank flow cytometric study use recipient ( post-transplant ) , sample stem cell product . OUTLINE : Peripheral blood sample collect donor prior stem cell mobilization patient prior start preparative regimen . Samples study single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) analysis , SNP array , proteomic analysis , gene expression , immunological laboratory method . Blood , urine , tissue sample preserve future study . Extra skin biopsy gastrointestinal biopsy perform diagnosis graft-vs-host disease preserve tissue bank flow cytometric study .</detailed_description>
