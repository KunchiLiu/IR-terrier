	<brief_summary>Background &amp; Rationale : About 75 % US population live today die cancer . There recent report colony cancer-resistant mouse develop single male mouse unexpectedly survive challenge lethal cancer cell injection . In so-called spontaneous regression/complete resistant ( SR/CR ) mouse , cancer cell kill rapid infiltration leukocyte , mainly innate immunity . This highly effective natural cancer immunity inherit mediate entirely white blood cell . Moreover , cancer resistance transfer wild type mouse transfer various immune cell type include granulocyte . The infusion white blood cell , particularly cell innate immunity , viable anticancer therapy human well . This propose trial test whether white blood cell infusion healthy unrelated donor use treat cancer . The trial design determine whether response see cancer patient infusion HLA-mismatched white cell healthy donor . It important donor recipient unrelated HLA-mismatched avoid possibility transfusion-related Graft v . Host Disease . The white blood cell healthy donor collect via apheresis follow granulocyte mobilization dexamethasone filgrastim . The investigator refer white blood cell 'granulocytes ' 75-90 % white blood cell collect apheresis consist granulocyte . The dose least 2x10 the11th give 4-5 donor rate one donor per day recipient . There one infusion per day 5 infusion per week . Thus , typical treatment study would span 1-2 week . After infusion , patient monitor carefully possible adverse event . If adverse event occur time point individual infusion , treatment stop adverse event manage . The daily dose infusion frequently use level long safety record . The trial observe subject 's cancer 3 month granulocyte infusion complete . Response 90 day base comparison tumor measurement baseline . The trial 3 major endpoint : dose response tolerance , safety , efficacy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Using White Blood Cells From Healthy Donors To Treat Solid Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 29 Subjects metastatic , non-hematological cancer enter . Potentially hundreds healthy Donor-participants recruit . A Donor Registry build store ABO/Rh-specific donor ; donor test HLA-specific genotyping well fully test infectious disease . Each patient receive granulocyte approximately 4 6 donor . Each donor HLA-mismatched avoid engraftment granulocytes transfusion-related GVHD . These infusion take place 1 2 week period , time dependent subject 's tolerance availability donor . Subject Response Assessment : For patient demonstrate disease progression , response status evaluate Days +90 +100 last infusion . Day+1 first day white cell infusion . All measurable lesion ( lesion accurately measure least one dimension [ long diameter record ] ≥20 mm conventional technique ≥10 mm spiral CT scan ) maximum 10 lesion representative involve organ identify target lesion record measured baseline . Target lesion select basis size ( lesion longest diameter ) suitability accurate repetitive measurement ( either image technique clinically ) . A sum longest diameter ( LD ) target lesion calculate reported baseline sum LD . The baseline sum LD use reference characterize objective tumor response measurable dimension disease . The criterion response , progression , relapse follow . - Complete Response : Disappearance target lesion . - Partial Response ( PR ) : At least 30 % decrease sum long diameter ( LD ) target lesion take reference baseline sum LD . - Progression ( PD ) : At least 20 % increase sum LD target lesion take reference small sum LD record since treatment start appearance one new lesion . - Stable Disease ( SD ) : Neither sufficient shrinkage qualify PR sufficient increase qualify PD take reference small sum LD since treatment start . Patients document response reconfirmation response list stable disease .</detailed_description>
