	<brief_title>Collection Storage Tissue Samples From Patients Undergoing Surgery For Suspected Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To provide tissue cell repository use Wake Forest University Comprehensive Cancer Center ( WFUCCC ) investigator . - To provide specialized research pathology service investigator . OUTLINE : Tumor normal tissue resect specimen ( possible ) harvest collected patient undergo plan surgery biopsy . Additionally , normal tissue and/or fluid remove course operation ( e.g. , cerebrospinal fluid brain tumor resection ) may also store use analyze change normal tissue cancerous tissue . Specimens rapidly frozen liquid nitrogen preserve mRNA , protein , lipid , DNA sample future analysis . Tissue store research project tumor treatment cancer patient . Research may involve analysis genetic makeup tumor tissue . Genes may clone live cell culture stored tissue . Blood also collect surgery . Samples maintain cataloged future retrieval . Information medical history collect patient medical record . This information include following : medical diagnosis ; specific information treatment ; medical condition ; medical data ( i.e. , laboratory test result , tumor measurement , CT scan , MRI scan , x-ray , pathology result ) ; side effect experience treatment side effect ; long-term information general health status status disease ; data may relate tissue and/or blood sample collect ; identify number code ( i.e. , social security number medical record number ) .</detailed_description>
