	<brief_summary>Primary objective : - To investigate whether physical exercise prior pregnancy formerly preeclamptic woman result comparable improvement vascular endothelial function woman uneventful pregnancy . Secondary objective : - Which cardiovascular endothelial parameter involve vascular adaptation train woman history preeclampsia . - To study vascular adaptation ( next ) pregnancy woman history preeclampsia compare woman history uncomplicated pregnancy , improvement physical condition exercise training . This study important order get good understand vascular endothelial factor involve preeclampsia effect train profile . Results study contribute improvement prevent hypertensive complication pregnancy reduction life time risk cardiovascular disease formerly preeclamptic woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Induced Improvement Venous Reserve Capacity Formerly Pre-eclamptic Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Netherlands almost 15.000 woman year develop hypertensive complication like preeclampsia first pregnancy . In western world complication account substantial attribution neonatal maternal morbidity mortality . The exact etiology disease cascade still unknown . There accumulate evidence subclinical abnormality preexistent haemodynamic , haemostatic endothelial factor involve , think negative impact placental endothelial functioning . The factor find risk factor cardiovascular incident therefore surprising remotely woman risk hypertension , cardiovascular disease stroke . Plasma volume possibly central role disease cascade , result decrease cardiovascular reserve capacity . Furthermore low plasma volume find strong predictor recurrence hypertensive complicate pregnancy . Adaptation , like pregnancy , large extent depend function venous compartment . In formerly preeclamptic woman low plasma volume venous compliance capacitance decrease , furthermore sympathic hyperactivity . This combination reflect decrease cardiovascular reserve capacity . These woman low plasma volume show reduced ability adapt cardiovascular system new pregnancy . It known physical exercise increase plasma volume healthy adult , also arterial venous compliance capacitance improve exercise . Since abnormal circulatory function common formerly preeclamptic woman , want study effect exercise specific group , compare result woman uneventful pregnancy . In preventive perspective would beneficial also formerly preeclamptic woman show circulatory adaption aerobic exercise , possibly could improve haemodynamic profile prior pregnancy</detailed_description>
