	<brief_summary>Background : Skin abscess grow problem general pediatric population around world . While standard treatment abscess/boil incision drainage , many physician also prescribe antibiotic , despite lack evidence antibiotic necessary help wind heal . The purpose research study determine whether antibiotic necessary incision drainage skin abscess child . This important question medical evidence show use antibiotic need contributed increase bacterial antibiotic resistance . In fact , several antibiotic successfully kill Staph bacteria several year ago longer effective antibiotic resistance . Now resistant form Staph bacteria , call `` Community-Acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staph Aureus '' ( CA-MRSA ) , account 50-85 % pediatric skin abscess . If antibiotic necessary withhold appropriate may help slow progression antibiotic-resistant Staph infection . Objective ( ) Hypothesis ( e ) : The investigator believe antibiotic well placebo achieve cure drainage abscess child . The objective study answer question : Do antibiotic abscess drainage result well chance cure placebo ? Potential Impact : If abscess drainage alone show effective drainage follow antibiotic , routine use antibiotic problem could avoid . This would help limit increase antibiotic resistance bacteria ( especially CA-MRSA ) communities around world . A well-designed study may provide evidence change way child treat abscess future antibiotic resistant bacteria even public health challenge .</brief_summary>
