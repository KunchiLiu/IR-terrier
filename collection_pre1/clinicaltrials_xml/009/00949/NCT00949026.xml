	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine effective take sample fluid patient 's brain tumor microdialysis catheter Torisel measurement . The investigator also learn safe . The investigator use sample measure much Torisel reach patient 's brain tumor . The use microdialysis catheter collect brain fluid FDA approve method . This catheter already use patient sustain severe brain trauma head injury . The catheter small size standard needle use take patient 's biopsy . To obtain additional information Torisel also measure time patient 's cerebral spinal fluid take catheter place patient 's cerebral spinal fluid produce space brain blood catheter one vessel .</brief_summary>
