	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving chemotherapy together monoclonal antibody therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well give docetaxel carboplatin together trastuzumab bevacizumab work treat patient stage I , stage II , stage III breast cancer bone marrow micrometastases .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine clinical response patient HER2/neu-positive stage I-III breast cancer bone marrow micrometastases treat docetaxel , carboplatin , trastuzumab , bevacizumab . Secondary - Investigate specific contribution VEGF CXCL-12 ( SDF-1 ) signal bone marrow support HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cell . - Evaluate growth factor chemokine expression profile investigate potential correlation expression patient outcome frequency tumor cell cluster ( mammospheres tumor stem cell phenotype ) microenvironment support culture . OUTLINE : Patients receive docetaxel IV , carboplatin IV , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 6 course , treatment modification may apply accord response . Tumor tissue bone marrow sample may collect laboratory analysis . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
