	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease associate high blood pressure , heart disease , stroke . Potassium lower blood pressure may help prevent heart disease stroke general population , well-studied people kidney disease . This study look benefit safety two level potassium intake patient kidney disease . We expect high level potassium intake safely lower blood pressure compare low level potassium intake . We hope research project help u learn guideline create potassium intake patient chronic kidney disease</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Potassium Intake Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In individual without chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , potassium ( K ) lower blood pressure ( BP ) may help prevent cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) stroke . In animal model , K prevent kidney injury decrease kidney inflammation . CKD patient may especially benefit high K intake , due high prevalence hypertension , CVD , stroke , possibility K may retard CKD progression . Despite potential benefit , great uncertainty optimal K intake CKD patient . K often restrict patient due concern elevate serum K. However , renal K excretion appear substantially impaired glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) severely decrease ( &lt; 10-20 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) . In randomized feeding study two-period crossover design , benefit safety 4 week 100 mmol versus 40 mmol K/day 26 non-diabetic adult stage 3 CKD ( estimate GFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) evaluate . After one-week run-in period , participant randomize receive either diet contain either 40 mmol K/day 100 mmol K/day ( within current K/DOQI recommendation K intake stage 3 CKD ) period 1 ( receive period 2 ) . The primary outcome variable 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP . Secondary outcome measure peripheral BP , central BP , inflammatory marker , serum K. We hope study lead large trial sufficient power examine effect increase K intake clinical outcome CKD progression . The ultimate goal effort develop scientific basis guideline K intake CKD .</detailed_description>
