	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Conformal radiation therapy use 3-dimensional ( 3-D ) image tumor help focus thin beam radiation directly tumor . Giving conformal external-beam radiation therapy high dos shorter period time may kill tumor cell few side effect . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Hormone therapy , leuprolide acetate , may lessen amount androgen make body . It yet know whether radiation therapy effective give together without hormone therapy treat patient prostate cancer undergone surgery . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study radiation therapy see well work compare radiation therapy give together hormone therapy treat patient undergone surgery stage I , stage II , stage III prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To investigate potential benefit post-operative radiotherapy v without combined adjuvant treatment consist short-term androgen suppression improve biochemical progression-free survival patient undergone radical prostatectomy stage I-III prostate cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord institution , pathological stage ( pT2R1 v pT3R0 v pT3R1 ) , Gleason sum ( ≤ 3+4 v ≥ 4+3 ) , WHO performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) . Within 3 month radical surgery , patient randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo post-operative conformal external beam irradiation 6.5 week . - Arm II : Beginning day -5 -3 , patient receive antiandrogen 2-4 week . Beginning day 0 , patient receive leuprolide acetate subcutaneously ( 6-month depot ) undergo conformal external beam irradiation 5 time weekly 6.5 week . Patients undergo quality life assessment periodically . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year yearly thereafter .</detailed_description>
