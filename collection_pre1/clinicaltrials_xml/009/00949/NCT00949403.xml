	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate liver receives use fat energy . This help investigator understand physical chemical process responsible Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) overweight female without NAFLD schedule undergo gastric bypass surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liver Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Study Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involve multidisciplinary approach address metabolic mechanism responsible Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) human . Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) become important public health problem many industrialize country high prevalence , potential progression severe liver disease , association cardiometabolic abnormality , include diabetes , metabolic syndrome , dilate cardiomyopathy , coronary heart disease . Although obesity important risk factor NAFLD many obese person minimal steatosis . The mechanism responsible pathogenesis steatosis know , must involve one following : 1 . Increased hepatic fatty acid ( FA ) delivery 2 . Decreased hepatic FA oxidation 3 . Increased de novo lipogenesis ( DNL ) 4 . Inadequate hepatic triglyceride secretion We hypothesize alteration metabolic process involve pathogenesis NAFLD . However , comprehensive evaluation factor individual cohort subject never perform , ability measure hepatic FA oxidation vivo human subject available . The follow Specific Aims evaluate obese woman without NAFLD , schedule bariatric surgery : 1 . Determine hepatic FA uptake oxidation use novel PET technique combination measurement DNL use stable isotope tracer assess liver tissue FA oxidative capacity evaluate gene expression FA oxidative enzyme mitochondrial content . 2 . Determine hepatic fatty acid delivery use stable isotope tracer assess rate free FA ( FFA ) release plasma cellular biology method determine expression protein content major tissue FA transporter ( CD36 ) . 3 . Determine hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein TG ( VLDL-TG ) secretion rate use stable isotope tracer . 4 . Determine liver histology factor involve inflammation fibrosis use routine staining immunohistochemistry .</detailed_description>
