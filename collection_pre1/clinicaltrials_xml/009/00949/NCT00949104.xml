	<brief_title>Role Oral Sucrose Reducing Pain Orogastric Tube Insertion Preterm Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MATERIAL &amp; METHODS PARTICPANTS : INCLUSION CRITERIA : The enrolled participant must fulfill follow inclusion criterion : - All pre-terms ( &lt; 37 week gestational age . ) - Within first 7 day postnatal day ( &lt; /=168 hour ) . - Clinically stable respiratory , hemodynamic metabolic point view . - Who receive painful stimulus least 30 minute prior intervention . - Requiring routine orogastric tube insertion within first 7 day life . - Only first attempt put OGT control NICU environment consider EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The neonate follow characteristic exclude study : - Neonates require ventilatory support . - Neonates require oxygen supplementation . - Having facial congenital anomaly . - Having neurological impairment . - Receiving opiate born mother receive opiate . - New born baby muscle relaxant , sedative analgesic administer . - With grade 3 4 IVH . - With major congenital anomaly - Any history birth trauma especially involve face scalp ( include cephalhematoma/ subgaleal bleed ) . - Face presentation . INTERVENTIONS : There two group study ( group A &amp; group B ) . The enrolled neonate administer either sterile solution 24 % sucrose double distilled water orally . These solution prepare sterile precaution laboratory staff unrelated study , pack 2 ml sterile syrinx cover opaque sealed envelope bear serially number patient code . The composition packet would decide senior consultant department pharmacology would access randomization sequence would uninvolved present study . Fresh solution prepare daily unused solution discard end day replace identically numbered solution laboratory . All study solution store refrigerator 2-8 0C use . The patient enrol study inform write consent obtain either parent/ caregiver . 2 minute prior procedure , 1 ml solution mark patient 's serial number administer orally patient nurse use syringe . The procedure would involve put 5-6 Fr . OGT neonate do group 8-10 nurse specially trained procedure . This insertion OGT do 2 min post administration test solution nurse blind content solution . The whole procedure ( begin 2 minute OGT insertion continue till 4 minute insert ) video record fix camera focus face patient . Neonate monitor use non invasive vital sign monitor monitor heart rate SpO2 change entire procedure 2 minute post procedure . The high heart rate low SpO2 obtain procedure till 2 minute post procedure record . The research candidate evaluate pain response procedure accord PIPP scale time t=pre-procedure , t=intra-procedure , t=post 30 sec , t=post 1min , &amp; t=post 2 min ; wherein denote time tube insert oral cavity . The research candidate also monitor time take OGT insertion use stopwatch . The neonatal nurse put OGT rate procedure easy , difficult difficult . OUTCOMES : PRIMARY OUTCOME : Painful response , assess PIPP scale . SECONDARY OUTCOME : Maximum heart rate minimum oxygen saturation record procedure . SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION : The sample size calculate base assumption would decrease least 20 % pain score study population intervention use alpha error 0.05 power 90 % sample size calculate 55 group ie total 110 neonate . RANDOMISATION : Block Randomisation use computer generate random sequence block size 4 . SEQUENCE GENERATION : Block randomization use computer generate random sequence use . ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT : This do pharmacy pack sucrose double distilled water ( control/placebo ) identical container opaque seal envelope sequentially label accord randomization code . IMPLEMENTATION : Randomization sequence generate senior consultant department pharmacology .The participant enrol study candidate accord serial number candidate blind . BLINDING : The participant , research candidate , nurse staff administer intervention well investigator assess painful response blind group assignment STATISTICAL METHODS : Descriptive statistic calculated.Between group comparison continuous variable do help test parametric data Mann Whitney test non parametric data.The proportion frequency calculate use chi square test .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Premature Birth</mesh_term>
	<criteria>All preterms ( &lt; 37 week gestational age . ) Within first 7 day postnatal day ( &lt; /=168 hour ) . Clinically stable respiratory , hemodynamic metabolic point view . Who receive painful stimulus least 30 minute prior intervention . Requiring routine orogastric tube insertion within first 7 day life . Only first attempt put OGT control NICU environment consider The neonate follow characteristic exclude study : Neonates require ventilatory support . Neonates require oxygen supplementation . Having facial congenital anomaly . Having neurological impairment . Receiving opiate born mother receive opiate . New born baby muscle relaxant , sedative analgesic administer . With grade 3 4 IVH . With major congenital anomaly Any history birth trauma especially involve face scalp ( include cephalhematoma/ subgaleal bleed ) . Face presentation .</criteria>
