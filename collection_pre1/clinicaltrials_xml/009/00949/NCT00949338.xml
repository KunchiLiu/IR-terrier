	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Having full bladder may improve effectiveness radiation therapy bladder . It yet know set bladder-filling instruction effective help patient keep bladder full radiation therapy . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial compare two set bladder-filling instruction treat patient prostate cancer undergo radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Two Sets Bladder-Filling Instructions Treating Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy For Prostate Cancer . ICORG 05-04</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare consistency bladder volume patient prostate cancer undergo conformal radiotherapy , randomize one two set bladder-filling instruction . Secondary - To compare incidence acute late genitourinary gastrointestinal toxicity patient treat method . - To determine patient satisfaction bladder-filling instruction . - To determine satisfaction bladder-filling protocol amongst radiation therapist doctor . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients empty bladder consume 6 cup water 30 minute undergoing radiotherapy . Patients also undergo bladder volume measurement use bladder volume instrument ( BVI ) periodically treatment . - Arm II : Patients empty bladder consume 3 cup water 30 minute undergoing radiotherapy . Patients also undergo bladder volume measurement use BVI periodically treatment . In arm , patient follow bladder filling instruction undergo conformal radiation therapy daily 8 week . Patients ' perception symptom , quality life , urinary symptom assess periodically International Prostate Symptom Score ( I-PSS ) . Patients ' satisfaction bladder-filling instruction ( i.e. , ability comply bladder-filling protocol , number incident wet accident , number incident repeat water drinking day due machine breakdown patient 's inability retain full bladder require amount time , level frustration ) assess periodically Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . Staff satisfaction bladder-filling intervention ( i.e. , patient compliance protocol , acceptance bladder dose-volume histogram [ DVHs ] , need re-scan fuller bladder , amount disruption therapist 's work schedule , number incident wet accident , number incident repeat water drinking day due machine breakdown patient 's inability retain full bladder require amount time , level satisfaction frustration ) assess periodically . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 4 year .</detailed_description>
