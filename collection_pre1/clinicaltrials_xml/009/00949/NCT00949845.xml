	<brief_summary>Recent research demonstrate relationship depression immune system activity , specifically proinflammatory cytokine activity . Although experimentally-induced immune activation lead increase depress mood , neural correlate associate change remain largely unexplored . Based relationship cytokine activity , depression , heighten physical social pain sensitivity , I propose investigate effect proinflammatory cytokine activation neural correlate socially painful experience may contribute depression . Our previous work show dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ( dACC ) , typically associated physical pain distress , also play role distress feeling associate social rejection social loss . Moreover , recent pilot data reveal individual elevate level baseline proinflammatory cytokine report feel distressed show dACC activity social rejection . To investigate causal role cytokine may play heighten social pain sensitivity contribute depression , participant randomly assign receive either endotoxin ( increase proinflammatory cytokine activity ) placebo . Subsequently , participant complete neuroimaging study reject online ball-tossing game . We hypothesize individual expose endotoxin report social distress depression follow rejection show dACC reactivity rejection . The propose study first investigate effect systemic inflammation neural reactivity relate social affective process may increase risk depression .</brief_summary>
