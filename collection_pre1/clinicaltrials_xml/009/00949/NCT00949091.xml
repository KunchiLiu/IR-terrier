	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Pharmacodynamics TAK-875 Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TAK-875 develop adjunct diet exercise improve glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . Nonclinical data suggest TAK-875 stimulate insulin secretion elevate blood glucose level , potential low hypoglycemic side effect . The purpose phase 1 , multiple ascending-dose study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics daily oral dos TAK-875 14 day subject type 2 diabetes mellitus . Participants house total 8 consecutive overnight stay clinic , undergo oral glucose tolerance test standardize meal test multiple blood sample throughout clinic stay .</detailed_description>
