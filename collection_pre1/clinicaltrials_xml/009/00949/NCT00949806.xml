	<detailed_description>The restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) chronic sensori-motor disorder affect estimate 7.2 % 11.5 % adult population . It characterise complaint irresistible urge move leg . This urge often accompany pain uncomfortable unpleasant sensation , either occurs worsen rest particularly night , improve activity . RLS diagnose clinically mean four essential criterion establish International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group . There still comprehensive understand underlying pathophysiological process RLS , evidence primary dopaminergic role RLS find excellent pharmacological response low-dose dopaminergic medication . Another recent evidence suggest enhance sensitization central pain processing patient RLS . This lead consider botulinum toxin type A ( BNT ) alternative treatment patient refractory current RLS medication suffer adverse event . The therapeutic benefit BNT injection patient recalcitrant RLS anecdotally report lately confirm report . The aim study evaluate efficacy tolerance intradermal BNT injection severely affect patient idiopathic RLS . For design phase II non comparative , open study . Patients severe RLS receive one-time intradermal administration BNT symptomatic area legs . Injections distribute grid distribution pattern cover total 20 equidistant site per symptomatic area . Each symptomatic area receive maximum 250 unit BNT ( 12.5 unit per injection ) . The total BNT inject unit exceed 1000 unit per patient . Outcome measure evaluate baseline , 2 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 week follow BNT administration assess mean International RLS Rating Scale Clinical Global Impression Scale .</detailed_description>
