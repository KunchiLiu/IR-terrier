	<brief_title>Intravenous Immunoglobulins Complex-regional Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CRPS , chronic pain syndrome associate trophic disturbance frequent complication limb trauma . More one third CRPS continue chronic disease include loss function one limb . Some report implicate autoimmune pathogenesis CRPS . Especially find autoantibody peripheral neuron successful treatment single case provide evidence possible successful treatment CRPS intravenous immunoglobulin ( IvIg ) . Therefore IvIg may important anti-inflammatory treatment prevent severe chronification CRPS . Since IvIg mainly effective B-cell-mediated autoimmune disease , autoantibody autonomic neuron concentration B-cell activate factor BAFF APRIL measure course study .</detailed_description>
