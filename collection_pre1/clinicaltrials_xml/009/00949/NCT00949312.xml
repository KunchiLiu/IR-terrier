	<brief_title>Studying Lymph Nodes Patients With Stage II Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine whether immunohistochemical molecular presence micrometastases ≥ 12 lymph node remove en-bloc resection patient stage II colon cancer correlate 3-year disease-free survival . - Evaluate prognostic significance molecular marker detect primary tumor develop microarray-based gene signature stage II colon cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Tumor tissue regional lymph node sample collect surgery analysis micrometastases molecular marker immunohistochemistry , qRT-PCR , MM qRT-PCR , qRDNA-PCR , microarray profiling . Patients follow periodically 4 year surgery .</detailed_description>
