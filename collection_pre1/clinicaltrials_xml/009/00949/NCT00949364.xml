	<brief_summary>This phase II , multi-center study pomalidomide adult patient PMF , SMF , unclassifiable MPN show least grade 1 bone marrow fibrosis require therapy . All patient receive per oral pomalidomide daily basis . First cohort ( Before Amendment No . 1 ID 1-41 ) : Treatment start phase pomalidomide therapy 2 mg per day . Individual dose reduction outline safety section allow . If response achieve ( complete remission ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , clinical improvement ( CI ) progressive disease accord IWG-MRT criterion ) 3 month , prednisolone add start dose 30 mg per day . In absence progressive disease , least 6 month treatment pomalidomide intend . In patient without disease progression 6 month response treatment intend receive pomalidomide least 12 month . Additional antiproliferative treatment hydroxyurea leukocytosis ( &gt; 20 x 109/l ) and/or thrombocytosis ( &gt; 750 x 109/l ) and/or symptomatic splenomegaly start dose 2g/day individual dose adjustment allow . Second cohort ( After Amendment No . 1 ID &gt; 41 ) : To evaluate relative impact prednisolone objective response rate , randomization integrate study concept . The addition prednisolone up-front randomized start prednisolone either 3 6 cycle treatment pomalidomide single agent response occur period . This result follow treatment arm : Treatment Arm A ) Pomalidomide 0.5 mg per day + additional prednisolone start cycle 4 ( day 85 ) , case response achieve end cycle 3 . Treatment Arm B ) Pomalidomide 0.5 mg per day + additional prednisolone start cycle 7 ( day 169 ) , response achieve end cycle 6 . Treatment patient start pomalidomide single agent dose 0.5mg per day . The addition prednisolone initiate randomize either start cycle 4 start cycle 7 ( start dose 30 mg per day ) . In absence progressive disease , least 12 cycle treatment pomalidomide intend . Additional antiproliferative treatment hydroxyurea leukocytosis ( &gt; 20 x 109/l ) and/or thrombocytosis ( &gt; 750 x 109/l ) and/or symptomatic splenomegaly start dose 2g/day individual dose adjustment allow .</brief_summary>
