	<brief_title>Measuring Responses Sublingual Antigens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Animal study show `` sublingual '' surface take antigen stimulate immune response , may different character response induce inject antigen . In previous study nasal oral delivery , use license vaccine preparation pure wellâˆ’characterised model antigen safe use human . We use licensed `` HPV '' vaccine source antigen study . The quantity character response ( lymphocyte number pattern surface protein , concentration type antibody fluid ) measure detail various anatomical site ( blood , vaginal secretion ) delivery antigens three occasion . As well use establish immune assay characterise response , develop new research assay detect population lymphocytes antibody present secretion . To ensure positive sample include assay validate new technique , recruit subject receive standard intramuscular injection , know nearly 100 % reliable inducing measurable immune response . As preliminary study recruit enough subject ( base previous experience nasal , oral injected delivery ) ensure generate sufficient response measure . We may able draw tentative conclusion difference character immune response follow sublingual injected delivery , intention initial study formally compare two route . If observe sublingual delivery human induce immune response , select assays test difference formally subsequent big focused study .</detailed_description>

They eligible free medical treatment They already vaccinate HPV vaccine They participate clinical trial last 6 month expose investigational product ( pharmaceutical product placebo device ) concurrent participation another clinical research study time enrolment . Use investigational nonregistered product ( drug vaccine ) within 30 day precede first dose challenge agent , plan use study period . They pregnant breastfeed . They know suspected ongoing cervicovaginal disease , malignancy abnormality discover time screen . They present sample obtain screen visit : positive result HIV , HBs Ag , antiHBc antiHCV antibody , clinically significant abnormality haematology . Normal range define pathology laboratory undertaking assay . They clinically significant acute chronic pulmonary , cardiovascular , hepatic renal functional abnormality , blood neurological disorder , immune dysfunction , autoimmune disease , diabetes ( exclude history gestational diabetes ) , malignancy time enrolment , determine medical history , physical examination laboratory screen test . They receive form immunosuppressive therapy past 6 month . They receive medication via vaginal route ( may interfere collection sample ) . They tongue frenulum piercings oral jewellery may interfere sublingual delivery . They receive blood product immunoglobulins 120 day prior enrolment . They thrombocytopaenia coagulation disorder ( bleed may occur follow intramuscular administration individual ) . Any medical , psychiatric social condition , drug treatment , occupational responsibility , judgement investigator , would interfere serve contradiction adherence study protocol ability give inform consent .
