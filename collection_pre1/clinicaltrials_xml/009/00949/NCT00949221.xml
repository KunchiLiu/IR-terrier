A randomized clinical study show efficacy short term ( 3 month ) . However , optimal clinical use device require rigorous assessment effectiveness glycemic control , tolerance acceptability medium long term . Primary objective : To assess long-term effectiveness two strategy use RT CGM ( continuous discontinuous ) glycemic control compare conventional blood glucose self-monitoring ( SMBG ) .

	<detailed_description>Despite development intensive insulin therapy , glycemic control define glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) &lt; 7,5 % remain inadequate pediatric patient type 1 diabetes . Improvement metabolic control limit daily number self measurement blood glucose required adjust closely insulin therapy Improving glycemic control particularly important type 1 child adolescent , whose risk vascular complication adulthood high , due duration disease whose adherence current strategy blood glucose self-monitoring limit . Real Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring augment alarm ( RT CGM ) recent innovation . A randomized clinical study show improvement HbA1c ( ≈ 1 % ) without increase frequency hypoglycaemia continuous use 3 month . Optimal clinical use new device require rigorous assessment effectiveness glycemic control , tolerance acceptability medium long term . Primary objective : To assess long-term effectiveness two strategy use RT CGM glycemic control compare conventional blood glucose self-monitoring . Secondary objective : overall comparison 2 strategy continuous use RT CGM v conventional SMBG HbA1c ; evaluate effectiveness others parameter glycemic control ( hypoglycaemia , ketoacidosis , glycemic variability ) ; evaluate impact glycemic control different factor include percentage effective time wear sensor ; evaluate : skin tolerance , acceptability device ; quality life satisfaction use device ; medico-economic impact use device . Population : Type 1 diabetes child adolescent inadequate metabolic control despite intensive insulin therapy , randomize 3 group . After period 3 month continuous measurement , two strategy intensive glucose monitoring continuous measurement 9 month ( total 12 month ) intermediate consist discontinuous measurement ( 40 % time 9 month ) , compare conventional blood glucose self-monitoring . The reduction HbA1c least 0,6 % require 50 patient per group , total 150 child . Primary endpoint : change rate HbA1c . Secondary endpoint : frequency acute metabolic event , non-severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia ; measure glycemic variability ; skin tolerance ; number sensor use percentage effective time use device ; satisfaction patient ; quality life diabetes-related quality life ; choice patient ( continue use device ) end study ; medico-economic evaluation . Benefits expect clinical trial : improvement glycemic control quality life child adolescent type 1 diabetes . Furthermore , study result would permit define optimal strategy use RT CGM paediatric population .</detailed_description>
