	<brief_summary>The study design determine long term , post trial effect two intervention study ADVANCE ( routine blood pressure lower perindopril-indapamide compare placebo intensive gliclazide-MR base glucose control compare standard guideline base glucose control ) individual type 2 diabetes high risk cardiovascular event . The long term , post randomization effect two study intervention investigate separately main trial . This study clarify quantify long-term , post trial ( often refer legacy ) effect two intervention broad population patient type 2 diabetes high low middle income country , set comprehensive cardiovascular risk factor treatment . With ADVANCE trial infrastructure surveillance system already place , implementation extend follow-up feasible .
