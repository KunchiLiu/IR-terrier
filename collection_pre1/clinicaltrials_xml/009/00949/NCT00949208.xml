	<detailed_description>This clinical study design support development new generation Given® Diagnostic System Agile™ Patency System accomplish good visualization , well diagnostic capability improve system ease use physician well patient 's point view . *The PillCam™ Capsules Capsule endoscopy use PillCam™ capsule ( Given Imaging Limited , Yoqneam , Israel ) represent new image modality gastrointestinal tract without need invasive technique , sedation , radiation exposure1-35 . Initially clear marketing August 2001 adjunctive modality , FDA 2003 clear PillCam™ SB ( previously call M2A ) stand alone tool detect small bowel abnormality patient meet device 's indication . The PillCam™ SB provide visualization entire small bowel mucosa presently purely diagnostic test without therapeutic biopsy potential . Before capsule endoscopy , enteroscopy one method examine small bowel tract , diagnostic value test wide variety specific lesion low due inability reach entire length small bowel . Other endoscopic technique include , Sonde enteroscopy , intraoperative enteroscopy , limited several reason include significant technical difficulty , length procedure , potential risk , frequently incomplete small bowel examination36-38 . To date 400,000 PillCam™ SB capsule ingest world wide . The Given® Diagnostic System ( GDS ) Small Bowel Gold standard . Additional PillCam™ capsule develop use diagnose Esophagus well Colon . The PillCam™ ESO system receive FDA clearance well CE mark early 2005 . To date , thousand PillCam™ ESO capsule ingest clinical trial regular clinical setup worldwide numerous publish clinical studies39-45 . The PillCam™ COLON capsule receive CE mark October 15th , 2006 clear market Europe . It pending FDA clearance . To date , several hundred PillCam™ COLON capsule ingest numerous pilot study ongoing multi-center study Europe USA34-35 . *The Agile™ Patency System Small large bowel stricture present large spectrum diseases clinical situation adhesion relate disease , Crohn 's disease , patient post abdominal radiation treatment patient undergone abdominal surgery46 . Knowledge intestinal patency patient aid physician assessment treatment patient . The current method identify intestinal stricture primarily include small bowel follow ( SBFT ) , enteroclysis , compute tomography ( CT ) enteroscopy diagnostic value test low . Advanced stricture often miss method include radiation others invasive . The Agile™ Patency System design aid gastroenterologist verify patency GI tract . The system essentially base small identification tag , detect radio frequency ( RFID ) encapsulate disintegrate capsule . The RFID tag market many year veterinary use . In animal inject sub-dermally used life-long identification , mark tracking47 . Preliminary result demonstrate Agile System perform intended48 . Future development unique technology make Agile patency capsule broaden range use application beyond simple patency test . Agile ingestion estimate excess three thousand worldwide .</detailed_description>
