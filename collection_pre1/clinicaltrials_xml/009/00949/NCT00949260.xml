	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether noninvasive method measure certain aspect blood circulation ( e.g. , blood pressure , cardiac output ) accurate reliable method detect change pregnant patient . Specifically , investigator interested patient diagnose high blood pressure pregnancy , compare normal pregnant patient . A noninvasive , accurate method take measurement pregnant patient currently available .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Assessment Healthy Hypertensive Pregnant Women Non-Invasive Bio-Reactance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During pregnancy , many aspect blood circulation , blood pressure , heart rate , cardiac output , stroke volume , adapt accommodate increase need pregnant body . The circulatory system work hard provide blood flow placenta grow fetus . Currently , device give physician detail information status blood circulation normal patient high blood pressure pregnancy invasive varying degree . However , recently , new noninvasive hemodynamic monitor ( NonInvasive Cardiac Output Monitoring : NICOM ) introduce market . In study non-pregnant patient , NICOM find accurate , precise reliable . However , yet study field Obstetrics . The purpose study find NICOM effective tool monitor hemodynamic change pregnant woman , normal high blood pressure . We plan compare hemodynamic profile normal pregnant patient , hypertensive pregnant patient , non pregnant patient control group . If monitor prof reliable assess change pregnant patient , could great impact optimize care patient different medical condition pregnancy , increase blood pressure .</detailed_description>
