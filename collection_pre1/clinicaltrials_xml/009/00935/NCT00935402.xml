	<brief_summary>Observational epidemiological study find link obesity short sleep duration prevalence increase past decade . At time , unknown whether short sleep cause obesity short sleep would lead obesity . Some study associate short sleep increase level hormone stimulate appetite . This study examine food intake energy expenditure modify sleep duration mean understanding potential causal pathway .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent epidemiological study show short sleep duration ( â‰¤5-7 h/night ) correlate overweight obesity , individual short sleep period tend high body mass index ( BMI ) sleep 8-9 h/night . The mechanism relationship currently unknown . However , energy balance must disrupt produce weight gain . Therefore , purpose study examine impact short sleep duration , 4 h/night , relative habitual sleep duration 8-9 h/night , energy balance . The major aim study compare energy expenditure energy intake period habitual short sleep duration examine neural hormonal pathway involve eat behavior period habitual short sleep . Men woman , 30-45 BMI 22-25 kg/m2 , recruit participate randomize , crossover study short habitual sleep period . During period 5 night , subject require sleep laboratory supervision . During time , subject total inpatient ensure compliance protocol . Each sleep duration period separate 2-4-wk washout period . On first day phase , subject give dose doubly-labeled water measure free-living energy expenditure 6-d period . During first 4 day , energy intake control meal serve fixed time . The last 2 day ad libitum feed self-selected meal . Hormones , include leptin , insulin , ghrelin , PYY , adiponectin , GLP-1 assess daily fast state , day 4 , 24-hour period , subject consume control diet fixed meal time . Functional magnetic resonance imaging measurement brain activity response food stimulus do day 5 examine brain region associate motivation eat . On day 5 , subject undergo measurement basal metabolic rate use indirect calorimetry . Ad libitum energy intake assess day 5 6 . Polysomnographic monitoring perform nightly assess sleep duration . Mediation analyse allow u determine whether hormone level relate predictive energy expenditure energy intake data . The measurement perform study allow u determine reduce sleep period impact energy balance potentially lead change body weight . As , provide comprehensive information neural , physiological , hormonal , behavioral network relate energy balance affect sleep duration .</detailed_description>
