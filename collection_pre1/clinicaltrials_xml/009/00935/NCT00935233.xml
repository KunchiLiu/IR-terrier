	<brief_title>Study Biomarkers Blood and/or Tumor Tissue Samples From Patients With Ductal Carcinoma Situ From Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To collect blood and/or tumor tissue patient ductal breast carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) age- ethnicity-matched control identify inherit variation predisposes woman develop DCIS . - To determine frequency variant . - To determine effect variant tumor risk . - To determine benefit test variant clinical set high risk could identify , counsel , screen . Secondary - To analyze acquire genetic change within DCIS identify case likely develop invasive disease . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . All participant complete questionnaire collect family history , brief medical history , epidemiological data . Patients undergo collection blood and/or tumor tissue sample ; DNA extract genotyping , comparison allele genotype frequency ( polymorphism ) , genetic profiling , DNA analysis , protein analysis . Histopathology report also collect . Healthy volunteer undergo collection blood sample . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A minimum 3,000 patient 3,000 control accrue study .</detailed_description>
