	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate drug rifampin fluconazole give together increase concentration body oral diabetes medication glyburide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interplay Between Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide ( OATP ) Transporters Transporters CYP2C9 Glyburide Pharmacokinetics ( PK )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study find drug interaction occur glyburide take rifampin fluconazole . Glyburide oral drug commonly use low blood glucose level diabetic patient . Rifampin antibiotic use treat tuberculosis variety infection cause certain germ call bacteria . Both drug affect protein find liver cell call organic anion transport polypeptide ( OATPs ) . This protein regulate drug get body . Fluconazole commonly use treat fungal infection like candidiasis , urinary tract infection variety infection cause fungi . It interact glyburide affect body 's ability breakdown glyburide . Since rifampin fluconazole play role way glyburide enters remain active body , want find effect take three drug together level glyburide blood .</detailed_description>
