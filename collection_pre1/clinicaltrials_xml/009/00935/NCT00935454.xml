	<brief_summary>This clinical investigation hepatocyte matrix implant evaluation blind non-randomized monocentric pilot study Phase I , conduct therapeutic investigation . Randomization possible due ethical practical reason . Pending approval ethical committee study also conduct Indonesia . This new treatment procedure already successfully use basis compassionate use Germany . The hepatocyte matrix implant new patent procedure consist bio-matrix technology . A formaldehyde-free special matrix consist self-dissolving polymer apply carrier substance cultivate human autologous cell use special technique . Clinically bioartificial liver replacement tissue patient end-stage hepatic disease develop first application . In procedure autologous hepatocytic tissue pancreatic tissue remove ( liver resection pancreatic biopsy ) patient first surgical procedure . The tissue send specialize Cell Culture Laboratory . The laboratory GMP certify procedure . The cell process accord SOPs special perfusion procedure prepare several platelet matrix ( platelet 20 mm diameter 4mm thickness ) . After completion laboratory process biotissues implant mesentery small intestine second operation . The cell grow control matrix , take capillary patient thus connect blood circulation . The implanted cell multiply specific factor independently take metabolic function original liver two four week . In follow process carrier matrix dissolve completely implanted cell develop liver cell tissue .</brief_summary>
