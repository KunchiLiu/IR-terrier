	<brief_title>The Role CK18F Predicting Graft-Versus-Host Disease ( GvHD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given difficulty assess diagnosis , severity biological activity GvHD clinical mean , objective parameter specific GvHD assessment highly desirable . Criteria appropriate GvHD biomarkers recently define , thereby state suitable validated marker monitor chronic GvHD still lack . CK18-F first marker mirror pathogenetic endpoint GvHD i.e . GvHD-induced apoptotic activity critical epithelial organ ( bowel liver ) . It represent new class GvHD marker complementary previously recognize immune activation parameter might thereby valuable establish serological signature diagnostic GvHD . This marker may allow distinguish active GvHD irreversible end organ damage clinical condition commonly observe transplant . The aim study evaluate diagnostic therapeutic decision clinical management hepato-intestinal GvHD may base measurement CK18-F level .</detailed_description>
