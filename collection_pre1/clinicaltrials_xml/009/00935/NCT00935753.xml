	<brief_title>Trial Kuvan Lesch-Nyhan Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lesch-Nyhan disease ( LND ) X-linked disorder purine metabolism result mutation gene enzyme hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase ( HPRT ) ; patient hyperuricemia , gout , urinary tract calculus , nephropathy effectively treat allopurinol . There also syndrome dystonia , chorea athetosis , well involuntary self mutilative bite aggression toward caretaker , treatment . Kuvanâ„¢ form tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) , approve help lower blood level phenylalanine people phenylketonuria ( PKU ) . LND patient find decreased BH4 spinal fluid brain ; BH4 precursor dopamine , effect behavior . In early study Dr Nyhan find treatment LND 5-hydroxytryptophan carbidopa abolish self-injurious behavior uniformly transient . This single site open-label protocol eight subject age 4 year old Lesch-Nyhan Disease document deficiency HPRT . The study involve three study visit San Diego one study visit do locally . The first visit last 13 day , follow visit single day visit week 4 week 8 , local study visit brief outpatient visit week 6 . Physical neurological exam , videotape patient 's interaction study staff , blood urine collection laboratory analysis perform San Diego visit . A family member caregiver ask complete short assessment form report illness medication change . In addition , study staff weekly telephone contact family discuss behavioral change study drug issue . If patient 's self injurious behavior becomes worse start Kuvan drug discontinue patient follow behavior return baseline .</detailed_description>
