	<detailed_description>This monocentric , prospective , non-randomized study assess amount main metalloproteinases ( MMP1 , MMP9 , MMP13 ) inhibitor TIMP-1 wound fluid diabetic foot ulcer . It aim demonstrate whether MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio equal 0.24 study entry predict wound heal 12 week later . All patient receive treatment accord local protocol . The difference standard care sample wound fluid week 0 week 4 numeric photograph wound area measurement week 0 , week 4 week 12 . The main outcome measurement percent change wind area week 0 week 12 Secondary objective include evaluation MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio equal 0.4 search confound factor . A correlation MMP-9 , MMP-13 wound healing also investigate .</detailed_description>
