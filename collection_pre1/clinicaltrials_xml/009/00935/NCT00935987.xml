	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study CYT387 Primary Myelofibrosis ( PMF ) Post-polycythemia Vera ( PV ) Post-essential Thrombocythemia ( ET )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPN ) , notably polycythemia vera ( PV ) , essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) , primary myelofibrosis ( PMF ) diverse inter-related suite clonal disorder pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell ( Tefferi et al. , 2008 ) . The MPN share range biological , pathological , clinical feature include relative overproduction one cell myeloid origin , growth factor independent colony formation vitro , marrow hypercellularity , extramedullary hematopoiesis , splenomegaly hepatomegaly , thrombotic and/or hemorrhagic diatheses ( Tefferi et al. , 2005 ) . This open-label , non-randomized , dose-escalation study , conduct two phase : single-centre dose-escalation phase supernumerary patient addition ( Part 1 ) , determine safety tolerability CYT387 , identify therapeutic dose confirmation portion study ; multiple-centre dose-confirmation phase ( Part 2 ) , cohort expansion maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) CYT387 . In Part 1 study , patient assign dose level successive cohort start dose first cohort 100 mg/day , administer orally single daily dose ( ie QD : least 20 28 hour apart , preferably fast state least one hour two hour meal ) . Dose-escalation proceed initially 1.5-fold increment however , base toxicity efficacy information specific dose level , dose escalation increment may reduce 1.25-fold escalation discretion investigator . At dose level , one patient experience Grade 2 toxicity high , dose-escalation may proceed 1.25-fold increment . The MTD define high dose level &gt; 2 6 subject develop first cycle DLT . New dose level may begin accrual subject current dose level observe minimum 28 day first day treatment . The recommended Phase II dose MTD unless significant clinical activity ( efficacy ) see MTD . With exception first cohort , dose level may decrease intend dose level next cohort , Grade 2 great toxicity observe . Twenty ( 20 ) patient assign receive CYT387 150 mg twice daily ( BID ) dose approximately 10-12 hour apart determine comparative safety , tolerability preliminary activity CYT387 administer twice-daily . Initially , maximum 6 ( six ) patient enrol safety assessment . If none six patient experience first-cycle DLT , remain 14 patient may enrol follow approval Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . In multi-centre portion study ( Part 2 ) , sixty ( 60 ) additional patient dose either 150 mg 300 mg daily ( QD ) . Subjects evaluate weekly first cycle , every 2 week cycle 2 , end subsequent cycle 9 cycle CYT387 treatment . If , 6 month therapy individual patient experience drug-related serious adverse event ( SAE ) , investigator may , write concurrence independent safety monitor , elect patient 's monthly safety assessment perform registered medical practitioner remote investigational centre . Subjects return follow-up visit 30 day completion last dose study drug . Subjects achieve least stable disease well tolerate drug well may allow continue receive CYT387 beyond plan 9 cycle extension protocol CCL09101E .</detailed_description>

Women childbearing potential , unless surgically sterile least 3 month ( ie , hysterectomy ) , OR postmenopausal least 12 month ( FSH &gt; 30 U/mL ) , OR unless agree take appropriate precaution avoid pregnancy ( least 99 % certainty ) screen end study . Permitted method prevent pregnancy must communicate study subject understand confirm . Men partner woman childbearing potential , unless agree take appropriate precaution avoid pregnancy ( least 99 % certainty ) screen end study . Permitted method prevent pregnancy must communicate study subject understand confirm . Females pregnant currently breastfeed . Known positive status HIV . Clinically active hepatitis B C. Diagnosis another malignancy unless free disease least three year follow therapy curative intent . Patients earlystage basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia , cervical carcinoma situ superficial bladder cancer may eligible participate Investigator 's discretion . Any acute active infection . Cardiac dysrhythmias require treatment , prolongation QTc ( Fridericia ) interval &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 470 msec female prestudy screen , unless attributable preexist bundle branch block . Presence ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy . Uncontrolled congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Classification 3 4 ) , uncontrolled unstable angina , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident , pulmonary embolism within 3 month prior initiation study drug . Uncontrolled inter current illness concurrent condition , Investigator 's opinion , would jeopardize safety patient compliance protocol .</criteria>
