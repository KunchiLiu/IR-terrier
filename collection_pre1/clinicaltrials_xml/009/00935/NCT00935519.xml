	<brief_title>Cementless New Alumina-zirconia Ceramic Bearing Total Hip Arthroplasty ( THA ) Asian Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) use metal-on-polyethylene articulation become one effective procedure surgical treatment end-stage hip disease . However , polyethylene wear debris-induced osteolysis postulate cause/contribute aseptic loosening THA , hence , regard important factor vivo longevity . In third generation ceramic manufacturing , many improvement , hot isostatic pressing , laser marking , non destructive proof-testing ceramic component , introduce . This third generation ceramic component high purity , high density , small grain size , , therefore , high potential resist crack propagation , may culminate fracture . In spite , number substantial concern , ceramic fracture , impingement-associated fatigue failure , wear , osteolysis long-term follow-up , persist use ceramic THA . In addition , third generation ceramic articulation associate increase incidence dislocation ceramic liner elevate rim extended-long-neck ceramic head available . However , new alumina-zirconia composite bear implant ( 4th generation ceramic bearing ) afford various option large head thin liner , may decrease ceramic fracture rate dislocation rate improve longevity THA . In addition , large head improve range motion possible traditional cross-legged sit position Koreans without impingement neck liner rim . So far , patient underwent THA use 28 mm femoral head diameter complain limitation range motion feel impingement sensation sit floor leg cross . There increase complaint especially Korean patient regard difficulty associate carry daily activity , whose life style involve sit floor leg cross . Therefore , large head new alumina-zirconia composite bear implant ( 4th generation ceramic bearing ) expect increase satisfaction Korean patient . This first study , knowledge , evaluation clinical outcome THA use new alumina-zirconia ( 4th generation ceramic bearing ) composite ceramic bearing functional outcome .</detailed_description>
