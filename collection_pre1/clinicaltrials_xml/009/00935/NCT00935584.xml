	<detailed_description>Anticipated Impact Veterans Healthcare : Health information technology ( HIT ) , include electronic medical record ( EMR ) potential improve quality safety ambulatory care . The VHA leader EMR implementation . It believe EMR use physician improve patient-centeredness visit , healthcare outcome . The proposed clinical trial address need rigorous research EMR use , patient-centered care , relevant health outcome . Both physician-patient communication EMR use cross-cutting clinical issue broad implication patient care within VHA . Consequently , propose project directly relate VHA 's mission use HIT improve quality health care veteran patient . BACKGROUND/RATIONALE EMRs potentially improve quality safety ambulatory care . However , little research systematically document effect EMRs patient-centered care . Studies EMR 's effect patient-provider communication observational small sample size . Overall , study report varied success regard provider integrate EMR office visit , suggest research need evaluate effectiveness train provider patient-centered communication EMR use . OBJECTIVES The PACE aim study EMR use affect patient-provider communication behavior , patient-centered care relate health outcome ; develop unique provider training program tailor patient-centered EMR use ; evaluate effect train intervention patient-provider communication , patient-centered care , provider EMR use . METHODS The study use quasi-experimental ( pre-post intervention design ) carry three phase : 1 . Pre-intervention : A pre-intervention patient-provider visit conduct patient-provider pair . Visits video record review verbal nonverbal patient-provider communication . MORAE software use record provider-EMR interaction data , include page view , navigation , mouse click . Data collect related outcome ( patient provider satisfaction ) . 2 . Training : Findings pre-intervention data guide development multifaceted provider train intervention promote patient-centered EMR appropriation . The training intervention deliver via full day train workshop individual feedback session . 3 . Post-intervention : A second round visit conduct patient-provider pair similar data collect pre-intervention . Within group analyse ( pre-post ) use test whether train intervention result significant improvement ( ) patient-centered EMR use ( b ) relate outcome ( patient provider satisfaction ) . IMPACT PACE finding emphasize need address EMR usability VHA hi2 ( Health Informatics Initiative ) iEHR team .</detailed_description>
