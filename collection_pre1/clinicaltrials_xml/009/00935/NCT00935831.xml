	<brief_title>Single Dose Safety Study Compound Treat Anemia Patients With Renal Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compound 1278863A novel small molecule agent , stimulate erythropoiesis inhibition hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) -prolyl hydroxylases ( EGLNs ) . This compound develop treatment anemia . This study , PHI112843 , first administration 1278863A investigate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics single oral dos 50 mg 150 mg pre-dialysis subject moderate severe renal impairment 150 mg hemodialysis-dependent subject . Four eight subject complete dose cohort . Multiple blood sample pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic analysis obtain post-dose cohort . Safety assess measurement vital sign , cardiac monitoring , collection adverse event assessment laboratory safety test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . A male female eligible enroll participate study he/she : ( Part 1 ) Moderate Severe Renal Impairment ( equivalent NKF KDOQI Stage 3 4 , receive dialysis ) determine estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate ( eGFR ) calculate abbreviated MDRD equation , OR Normal Renal Function determine creatinine clearance ( CLCR ) via CockcroftGault equation , use serum creatinine demographic data , obtain Screening . Subjects Normal Renal Function great trace blood protein Screening urinalysis . ( Part 2 ) severe renal impairment ( endstage renal failure ) stable hemodialysis treatment ( three time weekly ) 3 month prior Screening . otherwise healthy consider clinically stable respect underlie renal impairment determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring . clinical laboratory test result consider clinically stable opinion Principal Investigator , especially clinical abnormality laboratory parameter deem associated subject 's underlying renal impairment . A normal subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range may include Investigator Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . 2 . Male female 18 65 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . 3 . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method describe protocol wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . 4 . Male subject must agree use one contraception method list protocol . This criterion must follow time first dose study drug completion Followup visit . 5 . Body weight great equal 50 kg BMI within range 17 33 kg/m2 ( inclusive ) . 6 . AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin less equal 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . 7 . QTcB QTcF &lt; 450 msec ; QTc &lt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block . These base single ECG value average triplicate value obtain brief recording period . 8 . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . 1 . A hemoglobin value Screening : Healthy male subject postmenopausal female : &gt; 16.5 g/dL Healthy female subject : &gt; 15.5 g/dL Renally impaired male female subject : &lt; 10 g/dL 2 . The value hematological parameter Screening , healthy subject , outside reference range clinically significant deem Investigator Medical Monitor 3 . The value follow test Screening , healthy subject , : TIBC : outside reference range Serum iron : outside reference range Serum ferritin : outside reference range 4 . Clinically significant abnormal CPK determine Investigator Medical Monitor . 5 . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month Screening . 6 . A positive test HIV antibody . 7 . A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . A minimum list drug screen include amphetamine , barbiturate , cocaine , opiates , cannabinoids benzodiazepine . A positive prestudy drug screen , medication prescribe subject preexist condition ( ) , may allow opinion Investigator Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . 8 . History drug abuse dependence within 6 month study . 9 . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define average weekly intake &gt; 21 unit male &gt; 14 unit female . One unit equivalent 8 g alcohol : halfpint ( ~240 ml ) beer , 1 glass ( 125 ml ) wine 1 ( 25 ml ) measure spirit . 10 . History regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining excess 10 cigarette per day equivalent inability abstain tobacco nicotine use admission clinical research unit discharge dose period . 11 . Use prescription medication know inhibitor BCRP . 12 . Use nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study drug , unless opinion Investigator Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . 13 . History sensitivity study drug , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion Investigator Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . 14 . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia . ( clinical research unit use heparin maintain intravenous cannula patency ) 15 . Subjects preexist condition interfere normal gastrointestinal anatomy motility , and/or hepatic function could interfere absorption , metabolism , and/or excretion study drug . Examples condition could interfere normal gastrointestinal anatomy motility include cholecystectomy , gastrointestinal bypass surgery , partial total gastrectomy , small bowel resection , vagotomy , malabsorption , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , celiac sprue . Examples condition could interfere hepatic function include Gilberts syndrome . 16 . History peptic ulcer disease . 17 . Subjects polycystic kidney disease . 18 . Postrenal transplantation subject . 19 . History malignancy tumor . Nonmelanoma skin cancer definitely remove allow . 20 . Pregnant female determine positive serum BetahCG test Screening prior dosing . 21 . Lactating female . 22 . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . 23 . Unwillingness inability follow procedure , lifestyle and/or dietary restriction outline protocol . 24 . Consumption red wine , seville orange , grapefruit grapefruit juice and/or pummelo , exotic citrus fruit , grapefruit hybrid fruit juice prohibit fruit 7 day prior first dose study drug Dosing Period 1 collection final pharmacokinetic blood sample Dosing Period 2 , unless opinion Investigator Medical Monitor interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . 25 . The subject participate clinical trial receive experimental investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . 26 . Exposure four experimental investigational product within 12 month prior first dose day . 27 . Subject mentally legally incapacitate .</criteria>
