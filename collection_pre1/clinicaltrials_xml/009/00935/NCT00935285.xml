	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) typically refer nosocomial pneumonia develop 48 hour later endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation.ICU patient receive mechanical ventilation 4-fold high risk develop pneumonia rate 3 % per day day 7 intensive care unit . Several risk factor report associated VAP , include duration mechanical ventilation , presence chronic pulmonary disease , sepsis , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , neurological disease trauma . The immune system defend host infection . Protective immunity divide innate adaptive immunity . The innate immune response evolves first defence barrier host mount immediate , nonspecific , immune response rapidly destroy limit invader . The innate defense mechanisms external epithelium , mucosal surface , cell ( NK cell , phagocyte ) complement system . Adaptive immunity second line defence include T ( cellular ) B ( humoral ) cell mediate response . This specific , target pathogens self , memory sustain long-lasting immunity reinfection . Although innate immune system lack fine specificity adaptive immunity distinguish self non self . Innate immune recognition mediate system germline-encoded receptor name pattern recognition receptor ( PRRs ) recognize conserve molecular pattern ( pathogen-associated molecular pattern , PAMPs ) associate microbial pathogen . These receptor couple signal transduction pathway control expression variety inducible immune-response gene . TLRs control innate adaptive immune response . The TLR-induced inflammatory response dependent common signal pathway mediate adaptor molecule MyD88 . TLR expression observe variety cell macrophage , neutrophil , dendritic cell , epithelial cell derive gut , lung derma , B-and T-lymphocytes.TLR4 first mammalian TLR identify involve recognition lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , major cell wall component Gram-negative bacteria induce sepsis . TLR2 powerful receptor recognize wide variety PAMPs bacteria , yeast , fungi , parasites virus . TLR9 recognize unmethylated CpG motif present bacterial DNA . Sepsis syndrome frequently complicate development nosocomial infection , particularly Gram-negative pneumonia . Findings indicate TLR9 serve important signal generation protective innate response bacterial pathogen lung require effective innate immune response Gram-negative bacterial pathogen . Unmethylated CpG motif prevalent bacterial vertebrate genomic DNA . The recognition CpG motif activate host defense mechanism lead innate acquire immune response . Cells express TLR-9 plasmacytoid dendritic cell ( PDCs ) B cell consequence produce Th1-like proinflammatory cytokine , interferon chemokines . Activation TLR-9 induces production ) cytokine ( IL-12 , IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 ) , interferon ( IFN ) -γ tumor necrosis factor ( TNF- ) α Th1 proinflammatory cytokine b ) IL-10 IL-4 Th2 proinflammatory cytokine induce immunosuppression . Th1 cytokine play central role inflammation activation macrophage , NK cell neutrophils . Th2 cytokine inhibit Th1 immune response . This cause systemic systemic inflammatory response syndrome . Also , toll-like receptors-2 ( TLR2 ) -4 ( TLR4 ) play crucial role chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Their activation LPS Gram ( - ) Gram ( + ) bacteria lead activation neutrophil , NK cell , T- , B- cell inflammatory cytokine . In chronic disease , dysregulated inflammation maintain system state constant activation , potentially result tissue damage progressive disease . Understanding TLR system offer invaluable opportunity manipulate host immune response . AIMS 1 . To investigate elucidate role CD4+ και CD8+ Τ lymphocytes pathogenesis VAP . Also , level cytokine IL-4 IFN-γ time patient ICU develop VAP change subpopulation Τ lymphocyte . 2 . To evaluate apoptosis macrophage capacity phagocyte VAP patient . 3 . To study expression possible polymorphisms TLR-2 , TLR-4 TLR-9 gene . Understanding immune response VAP allow preparation immunotherapy protocol regulate immunological response . METHODS MATERIALS AND METHODS Bronchoalveolar lavage processing At first day , patient sample blood , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) tracheobronchial aspirate ( TBA ) take . Bronchoscopy technique visualize inside airway diagnostic therapeutic purpose . A bronchoscope insert airway , usually nose mouth , occasionally tracheostomy . This allow practitioner examine patient 's airways abnormality foreign body , bleeding , tumor , inflammation . Specimens may take inside lung : biopsy , fluid ( bronchoalveolar lavage ) , endobronchial brushing . BAL typically perform diagnose lung disease . In particular , BAL commonly use diagnose infection people immune system problem , pneumonia people ventilator type lung cancer . BAL often use immunological research mean sample cell pathogen level lung ( T-cell population ) . Specimens may take 48 hour diagnosis VAP . BAL place 10 % FBS-RPMIc centrifuge 400g , 5 min , add RPMI-1640 10 % FBS . The number type cell define Μay-Grunwald-Giemsa staining , subpopulation flow cytometry . PBMC isolation Human lymphocytes isolate readily peripheral blood density centrifugation carbohydrate polymer Ficoll ( Ficoll Histopaque , Sigma , Cat 1077-1 ) . This yield population mononuclear cell interface deplete red blood cell polymorphonuclear leukocytes granulocyte . The result population , call peripheral blood mononuclear cell , consist mainly lymphocytes monocyte . Diluted anticoagulated blood layer Ficoll centrifuge 400g , 30min 20ºC ( slow acceleration , brake ) . Red blood cell , polymorphonuclear leukocytes granulocyte higher density Ficoll bottom tube . But mononuclear cell consist lymphocytes together monocyte band recover interface . Cells wash use 1xPBS 1mM EDTA 3 time remove Ficoll platelet . Antibody label Anti-CD3-FITC ( fluorescein isothiocyanate ) , anti-CD8-PE ( phycoerythrin ) , anti-CD4-PE , anti-IFN-γ anti-IL-4 , anti-CD4 , anti-CD8 control IgG-FITC -PE use label cell . Fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) reactive derivative fluorescein , one common fluorophores chemically attach , non-fluorescent molecule create new fluorescent molecule variety application . DAKO system use . For stain , immunochemistry use plat cell Superfrost Plus slide cytocentrifugation kit DAKO accord instruction manufacturer . Immunohistochemistry Lymphocytes stimulate 24-well plate RPMI-1640 10 % fetal calf serum presence phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate , 25 ng/mL ; ionomycin ; 1 µmol ; Brefeldin A , 10 µg/mL ( Sigma-Aldrich ; St , Louis , MO ) . Cytospins make use cytocentrifugation 150 µL stimulate suspension store - 80°C . Approximately 175,000 cell cytospun slide sufficient lymphocytes stain . The double immunocytochemical method determination measurement CD8+IFN-+ , CD8+IFN-+ ( CD4+IFN-+ , CD4+IFN-+ ) perform two step . At step one , use primary anti-CD8 ( anti-CD4 , respectively ) mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody secondary rabbit anti-mouse IgG-FITC antibody . At step two , permeabilization , primary anti-IFN- IL-4 mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody ( Caltag ; Burlingame , CA ) secondary rabbit anti-mouse IgG-PE . A permeabilization kit use accord instruction manufacturer ( Dako ) . For estimation ratio , 500 T cell count &gt; 10 cytospins stain necessary number sufficient obtain mean value per subject remain constant increase number cell count . Flow Cytometric Analysis The sample prepare described analyzed fluorescence activate cytometer ( EPICS ELITE ; Coultronics ; Louton , UK ) . The lymphocyte tightly gate volume complexity forward ( 0o ) side light scattering ( 90o ) mode . Phycocyanate-conjugated anti-human CD45 monoclonal antibody ( DAKO ; Ely , UK ) use pan-leukocyte stain exclude non leukocyte event logical gating . The percentage one-color , two-color , three-color positive cell measure mean channel value well relative fluorescence intensity ( RFI ) correspond antigen density wii estimate . QC-Combo Kit ( FCSC ; San Jun , Puerto Rico ) use quantification antibody bind . Statistical Analysis Normality numerical parameter test use Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . Wilcoxon signed-rank test nonparametric outcomes paired test parametric outcome use comparison data two different time point ( stable condition exacerbation ) . Statistical software ( SPSS version 11.0 ; SPSS ; Chicago , IL ) use analysis .</detailed_description>
