	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate volunteer safely reproducibly infected Plasmodium vivax ( P. vivax ) bite experimentally infected Anopheles dirus ( An . dirus ) mosquitoes carry P. vivax sporozoites salivary gland .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Development Safe Malaria Challenge Model That Can Reproduced Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study proof-of-concept clinical investigation design develop safe practical sporozoite challenge model Plasmodium vivax human goal 100 % infectivity rate . The development standardization model make possible efficacy evaluation candidate P. vivax vaccine Phase 2a trial . This trial conduct collaboration Armed Forces Research Institute Medical Sciences ( AFRIMS ) investigator Bangkok , Thailand , recruit adult blood donor pool patient present active P. vivax infection Thailand . Samples P. vivax infect blood collect fed via membrane feed apparatus colony-reared Anopheles dirus mosquito AFRIMS Entomology Lab . A portion blood meanwhile screen potential co-infections AFRIMS Retrovirology Laboratory . When screen test confirm presence P. vivax blood ( co-infections malaria specie ) , select dissection day 3-7 revealed oocyst production blood-fed mosquito , mosquito transport AFRIMS insectary Thailand WRAIR insectary US standard procedure ( herein describe ) include permit assurance accidental release infect mosquito . Transport conduct compliance Thai export US importing requirement . Our study involve two cohort , challenge , hope demonstrate reproducibility entire challenge procedure . Each cohort comprise 6 healthy adult volunteer . The first cohort challenge 5 bite P. vivax-infected mosquito carry least grade 2 sporozoite infection ( &gt; 10 sporozoite salivary gland ) . If six volunteer first cohort develop P. vivax infection , procedure repeat second cohort . If first cohort le 100 % infectivity rate , second cohort challenge 10 grade 2 infective bite ensure 100 % infectivity rate . Volunteers closely monitor post-infection , treat standard chloroquine primaquine therapy infection become patent peripheral blood .</detailed_description>
