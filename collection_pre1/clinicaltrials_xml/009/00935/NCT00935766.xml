	<brief_summary>The overall objective LUCHAR Specific Aims 4.1 4.2 assess additional contribution cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk marker traditional biomedical risk factor prediction pre-clinical CVD . Specific Aim 4.3 test impact omega-3 fatty acid supplementation risk marker pre-clinical marker CVD Hispanic patient . Specific Aim 4.3 : Conduct randomize , placebo-controlled trial effect omega-3 fatty acid supplementation vascular function measure brachial artery reactivity ( BAR ) circulate inflammatory marker . Hypotheses : 1 . Daily omega-3 fatty acid supplementation improve vascular function subject high risk CVD . 2 . Daily omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduce inflammatory protein panel score subject high risk CVD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Omega-3 fatty acid reduce triglyceride ( TG ) manner similar fibric acid lower hepatic TG release , reduce VLDL production , stimulate lipoprotein lipase enhance TG clearance . Although statin widely utilize among DH patient , overall population , even CHD , fairly low level LDL-cholesterol ( Krantz et al , 2004 ) . This likely reflect population predominantly Latino high incidence metabolic syndrome . Among patient , often achieve LDL-c NCEP target , yet secondary goal non-HDL , HDL , TG rarely achieve . This unmet opportunity give strong independent contribution non-HDL ( McQueen et al , 2008 ) , HDL ( D'Agostino et al , 2008 ) TG ( Nordestgaard et al , 2007 , Tirosh et al , 2007 ) CHD risk , may particularly important Latino population . The study drug ( LOVAZA ) improve TC/HDL ratio strong predictor CHD event base ~30,000 patient Interheart study note . LOVAZA hepatic P450 effect matter meaningful clinical adverse effect , make advantageous use population multiple co-morbidities risk drug-drug interaction difficulty medication adherence . Given high incidence insulin resistance among DH 's predominately Latino CHD population , strong lipid ( Harris et al , 1997 ; Davidson et al 2007 ) well outcome data CHD ( GISSI investigator , 1999 ) agent potential clinical utility population . To date , improve outcome non-CHD population demonstrate prospectively LOVAZA . Although recent data suggest promising effect inflammatory maker LpPLA2 , impact LOVAZA pre-clinical marker atherosclerosis BAR CIMT well characterize particularly among Latinos . Moreover , change inflammatory marker limit expansive evaluation currently available . Against background assess whether LOVAZA might improve atherosclerotic risk via improvement flow mediate dilation brachial artery well reduction comprehensive inflammatory marker panel .</detailed_description>
