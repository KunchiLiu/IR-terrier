	<brief_summary>To evaluate efficacy consumption yoghurt fortify 30 % recommend dietary allowance ( RDA ) essential micronutrient ( iron , zinc , vitamin A iodine ) period one year comparison yoghurt without fortification change mean level proportion deficient marker status Iron ( Hemoglobin , Serum ferritin , Serum transferrin , ZnPP ) , Vitamin A ( Plasma retinol level ) , Iodine ( Urinary iodine level ) , Zinc ( Plasma zinc ) , copper ( Plasma copper level , sub sample child ) ; improvement cognitive development , reduction episodes/days illness ( diarrhea , pneumonia , febrile illness ) , hospitalization morbidity cause absenteeism school improvement growth . Additionally evaluate efficacy consumption fortify non fortify yoghurt ( plain yoghurt ) period 12 month comparison pure control receive intervention improvement cognitive development physical growth . The main objective evaluate impact addition micronutrient Yoghurt best address RCT . The effect take yoghurt per se blind investigator include concurrent control . Hypothesis : Consumption fortify yoghurt 30 % RDA essential micronutrient ( iron , zinc , vitamin A iodine ) period one year improve micronutrient status indicator , cognitive development , growth reduce morbidity child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study population : Children age 6-9 year boys girl 6 primary school Gabtali town Bogra district Bangladesh . Sample Size : 1200 child ( 400 group ) Enrollment eligible child Base line information : Details eligible child obtain school part study parent contact appointment either telephone sending note . Consent participation seek evaluate inclusion exclusion criterion randomize receive either fortified non fortify yoghurt , similarly consent obtain parent child non yoghurt area give intervention . Baseline information socioeconomic information , retrospective morbidity information child last 15 day , hospitalization , hygiene sanitation information record . Baseline clinical assessment anthropometric measurement conduct . 5 ml venous blood sample ( approx . one spoonful blood ) mid stream urine sample obtain trained nurse/technician employ project . Developmental assessment measure child 's intelligence executive functioning ( WISC , KCPT , WCST ) conduct use standardized test . Blood/urine sample do child pure control group ( intervention ) . Randomization blinding : Randomization schedule drawn use randomization permute block fix length appropriate double blind study . Intervention Follow-up : For yoghurt group , intervention would supply disposable 80 g cup . Computer label generate daily basis identification information allocate code print enrolled child database appropriate yoghurt cup label child . The labeled yoghurt cup hand school supervisor deliver student his/her supervision lunch break school . Children receive intervention period 12 month . Children match control non-yoghurt area receive intervention . Mid Study data collection : Similar baseline , anthropometric measurement do 5ml blood sample ( approx one spoonful blood ) obtain assess difference marker baseline mid study . Blood/urine sample do child pure control . End Study data collection : An end study similar baseline , anthropometric measurement take 5ml blood sample ( approx one spoonful blood ) obtain assess difference marker baseline end study . Blood/urine sample do child pure control ( intervention group ) . Detailed developmental assessment use battery computerized neuropsychological ( CANTAB ) cognition test ( WISC , K-CPT WCST ) conduct . Academic achievement assess use school report card . Intervention Groups : There one study group one control group . Both group would receive yoghurt 80 g cup . The study group would receive yoghurt fortify 1/3rd RDA iron , zinc , vitamin A iodine .</detailed_description>
