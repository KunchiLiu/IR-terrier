	<brief_summary>The purpose research determine one 's bone marrow tissue help regenerate ( grow ) bone area jaw implant place . The name process call Bone Repair Cell ( BRC ) Therapy . A sample bone marrow tissue collect sent laboratory process form cell . These new cell transplant regenerative site sinus floor augmentation site . The researcher test see cell ( BRC ) help form bone indicating . The research also determine implant stable area new bone growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Tissue Engineering Using Autologous Bone Repair Cell ( BRC ) Therapy Sinus Floor Bone Augmentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall aim promote bone regeneration , use Aastrom 's proprietary Adult Stem Cell Therapy ( AST ) develop collaboratively University Michigan , enable placement dental implant patient lack adequate alveolar bone . This project address specifically placement dental implant follow bone regenerative sinus floor augmentation . This novel therapy mitigate risk therapy , provide additional benefit adequate cell number high quality bone regeneration , potential become new standard care . In Aastrom 's patented manufacturing technology , iliac bone marrow aspirate expand ex-vivo enrich adult multipotent cell ( Bone Repair Cells- BRC ) capable regenerate bone blood vessel . BRC mixed bone matrix graft extender , beta-tricalcium phosphate ( Î²-TCP ) , implantation regenerative site .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age range : 2070 yr Gender : Male female Systemically healthy : Physical status accord American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) I II Requiring sinus augmentation allow dental implant placement Missing teeth : Maxillary second premolar , maxillary first molar and/or maxillary second molar Remaining alveolar bone height : 2 6 mm Must able willing follow study procedure instruction Must read , understood sign informed consent form Allergies hypersensitivity study related medication : dexamethasone , chlorhexidine , ibuprofen . For patient allergic amoxicillin comparable substitute antibiotic use Hematologic disorders/ blood dyscrasia Active infectious disease Liver kidney dysfunction/failure Patients blood drawn serum laboratory test , include creatinine , blood urea nitrogen , AST , ALT , bilirubin . All must within normal limit patient include study Laboratory value define normal renal hepatic function , well criterion exclusion metabolic bone disease consistent establish University Michigan Health System ( UMHS ) . Normal clinical value use help assure health subject trial . Potential subject whose laboratory value fall outside UMHS normal range consider clinically significant require medical clearance primary care provider prior participation . Potential subject present clinically insignificant laboratory abnormality require medical clearance consider inclusion study Endocrine disorders/dysfunctions ( i.e . Type I II diabetes ) Cancer The explicit definition cancer use exclude patient consistent described National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , National Institutes Health . According NCI , cancer disease abnormal cell divide without control invade nearby tissue ( invasive disease ) . These include carcinoma , sarcoma , leukemia , lymphoma . Any patient history invasive disease exclude study . Patients currently use bisphosphonates history bisphosphonate use exclude trial HIV+ Metabolic Bone Diseases Patients metabolic bone diseases Paget 's disease , hypercalcemia , moderate severe vitamin D3 abnormalities metabolic bone disease include osteoporosis osteoporotic fracture exclude Pregnant woman Female patient childbearing potential exclude except use hormonal barrier method birth control ( oral parenteral contraceptive , diaphragm plus spermicide , condom ) . Pregnancy status determine urine test patient pregnant exclude Patients acute sinusitis , present sinus pathology would contraindicate sinus augmentation Patients congenital metabolic bone disorder Current smoker ( smoke within 6 mo . study onset ) Subjects congenital , comorbid condition would affect study outcome interpretation study result exclude Individuals BMI outside normal limit deems overweight ( BMI &gt; 25 ) exclude due potential difficulty locate appropriate surgical entry iliac crest bone marrow aspiration procedure Long term ( &gt; 2 week ) use antibiotic past 3 month Periodontally unstable subject Subjects extraction possible treatment area past 3 month Subjects edentulous</criteria>
