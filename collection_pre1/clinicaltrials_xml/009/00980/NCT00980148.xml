	<detailed_description>Genital chlamydia public health concern . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate 90 million new case sexually transmit disease ( STDs ) per year cause Chlamydia ( C. ) trachomatis . In United States alone , approximately 3 million new case chlamydia report yearly , cost associate management complication exceed $ 2 billion . Unfortunately , least 75 percent female chlamydia asymptomatic , unless infection detect chlamydia testing ( screen ) , infection may transmit others lead complication . The Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) recommend either azithromycin 1 gram ( gm ) mouth ( PO ) doxycycline 100 milligram ( mg ) PO twice daily ( BID ) 7 day co-equal therapy uncomplicated chlamydia . A secondary aim determine demographic predictor chlamydia treatment failure follow azithromycin doxycycline treatment , explore clinical parameter , distinguish persistent infection . The study design Phase III trial address major limitation prior chlamydia efficacy study find reveal true efficacy azithromycin doxycycline uncomplicated chlamydia adolescent factor predict treatment failure . This study design primarily determine frequency chlamydia treatment failure follow either azithromycin doxycycline regimen evaluate whether efficacy azithromycin regimen inferior doxycycline regimen . Both drug Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve use U.S . The study enroll 650 male female age 12-21 year good health ( base vital sign provider 's clinical evaluation document medical record ) reside long-term gender-segregated ( co-ed ) youth correctional facility ( YCFs ) ( usual stay &gt; 3 week ) identify chlamydia-infected would comprise study population 306 evaluable subject obtain . Only individual positive chlamydia screen test enrol , negative screening test exclude . Consenting chlamydia-positive subject enrollment visit ( study visit 1 ) enrol , ask provide demographic data , provide first-void urine sample ( mid-stream specimen ) repeat chlamydia test Gen-Probe ( GP ) AC2 ( verification chlamydia ) , randomize 1 2 treatment arm ( 190 153 subject per arm ) : doxycycline 100 mg PO BID 7 day azithromycin 1 gm PO single dose . Both therapy give directly observe , side effect evaluate first follow-up visit ( day 28 study drug initiation ) . If subject 's GP AC2 enrollment treatment visit return negative C. trachomatis , categorize unevaluable remove study , site investigator determine whether subject complete treatment receive therapy . Subjects whose GP AC2 enrollment treatment visit positive C. trachomatis ask provide first-void urine sample repeat chlamydia test GP AC2 28- 67-days study drug initiation [ correspond first follow-up visit ( study visit 2 ) second follow-up visit ( study visit 3 ) , respectively ] .</detailed_description>
