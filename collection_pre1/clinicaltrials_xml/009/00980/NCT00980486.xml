	<detailed_description>The majority information regard pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics ( action , property elimination drug body ) antibiotic base measurement serum plasma concentration . Current guideline surgical antibiotic prophylaxis clearly demonstrate appropriate therapeutic level within blood serum level , result low incidence postoperative bacteremia ( bacteria blood ) sepsis ( infection ) . Despite , surgical site infection ( SSI ) remain common postoperative complication , affect 20 % patient undergoing intra-abdominal surgery . Inadequate antibiotic penetration tissue surgical site , spite therapeutic serum level , result environment susceptible pathogen subsequent infection . Antimicrobial tissue level influence volume distribution , regional blood flow biological property tissue . The ability drug reach tissue interest dictate relative amount blood flow organ . While lung kidney enjoy robust blood supply , subcutaneous adipose tissue ( fat ) ( frequent site surgical site infection ) receive small fraction cardiac output . Obesity create increased volume distribution , thereby result great dilution antibiotic compare non-obese subject . Moreover , change volume distribution achieve primarily increase relative amount poorly perfuse adipose tissue . Therefore , come surprise obesity significant risk factor surgical site infection . The rate obesity United States show steady increase double last twenty-five year 15 % 1980 32.9 % 2004 . Moreover , nearly one third woman reproductive age obese approximately 6 % extremely obese . In addition usual health relate concern , obesity significantly increase rate complication associate pregnancy . In particular , several study demonstrate increased incidence cesarean delivery associate maternal obesity . Cesarean delivery rate , much like obesity rate , witness tremendous surge last decade account approximately 30 % delivery nearly 1.2 million procedure . Surgical site infection associate cesarean delivery include wound infection endomyometritis ( infection uterus ) , rate range 7 % 20 % depend demographic obstetric variable . Despite alarm trend paucity data regard antimicrobial activity prophylactic antibiotic tissue effect maternal obesity concentration time cesarean delivery . While rate cesarean delivery reach plateau around 30 % recent year , rate obesity continue climb unabated . As attributes population evolve course time must guideline management adapt individual care .</detailed_description>
