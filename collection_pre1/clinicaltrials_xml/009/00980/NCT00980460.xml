	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate event-free survival ( EFS ) child stage I ( non-pure fetal histology [ PFH ] , non-small cell undifferentiated [ SCU ] ) stage II ( non-SCU ) hepatoblastoma treat surgical resection follow 2 cycle cisplatin , fluorouracil , vincristine sulfate ( C5V ) . II . To determine feasibility toxicity add doxorubicin ( doxorubicin hydrochloride ) chemotherapy regimen C5V child intermediate-risk hepatoblastoma . III . To estimate response rate vincristine ( vincristine sulfate ) , irinotecan ( irinotecan hydrochloride ) , temsirolimus previously untreated child high-risk , metastatic hepatoblastoma . IV . To determine whether timely ( diagnosis end second cycle chemotherapy ) consultation treatment center surgical expertise major pediatric liver resection transplant achieve 70 % patient potentially unresectable hepatoblastoma . V. To foster collection tumor tissue biologic sample facilitate translational research provide data may aid risk-adapted approach subsequent clinical trial . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate EFS patient stage I PFH treat surgery alone . II . To determine whether orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLT ) accomplish successful referral completion 4 cycle initial chemotherapy . III . To estimate 2-year EFS patient identify candidate possible OLT , 2-year EFS patient refer transplant center resect without OLT , 2-year EFS patient refer transplant center receive OLT . IV . To register child hepatoblastoma receive OLT PLUTO ( Pediatric Liver Unresectable Tumor Observatory ) , international cooperative registry child transplant liver tumor . V. To determine pretreatment extent disease ( PRETEXT ) group predict tumor resectability . VI . To monitor concordance institutional assessment PRETEXT group PRETEXT grouping perform expert panel review . VII . To estimate proportion stage IV patient surgical resection metastatic pulmonary lesion . VIII . To determine proportion estimate EFS patient potentially poor prognostic factor include alpha fetoprotein ( AFP ) &lt; 100 ng/mL diagnosis , microscopic positive surgical margin , surgical complication , multifocal tumor , microscopic vascular invasion , macrotrabecular histologic subtype , SCU histologic subtype . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 4 treatment group accord risk group . VERY LOW-RISK GROUP : Patients undergo surgery receive treatment . LOW-RISK GROUP : ( regimen T ) Patients undergo surgery receive adjuvant cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 6 hour day 1 , fluorouracil IV day 2 , vincristine sulfate IV day 2 , 9 , 16 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . INTERMEDIATE-RISK GROUP : ( regimen F ) ( close accrual 3/12/2012 ) Patients receive C5VD chemotherapy comprise cisplatin IV 6 hour day 1 , fluorouracil IV day 2 , vincristine sulfate IV day 2 , 9 , 16 , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 15 minute day 1-2 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also undergo surgical resection course 2 OR surgical resection liver transplantation course 4 C5VD . HIGH-RISK GROUP : ( regimen H ) Patients receive front VIT chemotherapy comprise vincristine sulfate IV day 1 8 irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute day 1-5 , temsirolimus IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment VIT repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease response receive 6 course C5VD 4 course VIT 2-course block . Patients disease response receive 6 course C5VD absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo tumor resection liver transplant course 4 C5VD follow 2 course adjuvant C5VD . After completion study therapy , patient receive chemotherapy follow periodically least 4 year .</detailed_description>
