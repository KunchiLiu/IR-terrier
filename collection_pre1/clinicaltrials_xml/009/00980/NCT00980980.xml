	<brief_summary>The Randomized Evaluation Decolonization versus Universal Clearance Eliminate MRSA ( REDUCE MRSA ) Trial cluster randomize trial comparative effectiveness three strategy prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) intensive care unit . The three strategy evaluate : - screen admission follow isolation MRSA+ patient - screen admission follow isolation decolonization MRSA+ patient - universal decolonization admission screening . The decolonization regimen involve bath chlorhexidine plus intra-nasal application mupirocin . The main outcome MRSA+ clinical culture . The study partnership CDC , CDC Prevention Epicenters , Hospital Corporation America .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Baseline data involve 12 month data participate hospital ( July 2008 - June 2009 ) collect prior randomization account size ICU baseline prevalence MRSA randomization scheme . Randomization occur hospital level . Eligibility survey conduct determine exclusion criterion . As May 2010 , enrollment close . 45 hospital randomize , two find meet exclusion criterion exclude . As-randomized ( as-assigned ) analysis include 43 hospital , represent 74 ICUs . Individual ( patient-level ) subject enrollment intervention 74,256 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion include HCA hospital reside US state physicians NOT routinely prescribe decolonization MRSA + ICU patient . Exclusion criterion include hospital ICU physician often prescribe decolonization MRSA+ ICU patient . Dedicated burn ICUs also exclude due inability perform routine bathing . Finally , since intent ass intervention adult ICUs , pediatric hospital exclude although patient &lt; 13 year old admit participate adult ICUs include unitbased intervention .</criteria>
