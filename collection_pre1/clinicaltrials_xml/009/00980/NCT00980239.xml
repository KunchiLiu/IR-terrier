	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn high tolerable dose irinotecan give directly liver , combination drug give vein . The drug combination give vein include bevacizumab alone , bevacizumab plus oxaliplatin , bevacizumab plus cetuximab . This tested patient advance solid tumor spread liver . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HAI Irinotecan + IV Bevacizumab , Bevacizumab &amp; Oxaliplatin Bevacizumab &amp; Cetuximab Advanced Cancers Metastatic Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Irinotecan design stop cancer cell make new DNA ( genetic material cell ) . This may cause cancer cell die . Bevacizumab design prevent slow growth cancer cell block growth blood vessel supply nutrient necessary tumor growth . Oxaliplatin design block new cancer cell grow . Cetuximab design prevent slow growth cancer cell block protein inside cancer cell . Study Arms Dose Levels : If find eligible take part study , doctor assign study arm . Your study arm depend type cancer , Kirsten rat sarcoma ( KRAS ) test result ( applicable ) , drug take past . - If Arm A , receive irinotecan bevacizumab . - If Arm B , receive irinotecan , bevacizumab , oxaliplatin . - If Arm C , receive irinotecan , bevacizumab , cetuximab . The dose receive depend enrol study safety data available time . The first set 3-6 participant join study arm receive low dose drug combination . The next set 3-6 participant receive high dose drug combination . Each new set participant receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose drug combination find . Once high tolerable dose find arm , 14 participant tumor type respond well particular study drug combination receive study drug dose level . These participant `` expansion '' arm . Catheter Placement : You hospitalize receive study drug combination . The morning enter hospital , catheter place right groin area . A catheter sterile flexible tube . It place large artery ( blood vessel carry blood liver ) area numb local anesthetic . Your doctor explain procedure detail , ask sign separate consent form . After return room , receive irinotecan described . Study `` cycle '' repeat every 28 day . The catheter place removed cycle . Each time , lie bed entire time catheter place . While catheter remove , study staff apply pressure groin area 15 minute stop bleeding . Study Drug Administration : Irinotecan give catheter liver artery , continuously 48hours ( Days 1 2 cycle ) . Before every irinotecan dose , also receive drug vein low risk nausea , doctor think need routine care . Bevacizumab give vein every 2 week . The first time receive bevacizumab , give 90 minute . If tolerate well , bevacizumab dos give 30-60 minute . Oxaliplatin , receive , give vein 2 hour every 2 week . Before every oxaliplatin dose , also receive drug vein low risk nausea , doctor think need routine care . Cetuximab , receive , give vein every 2 week . The first time receive cetuximab , give 2 hour . All cetuximab dos give 1 hour . If tolerate study drug combination well , dos receive may lower . If experience certain side effect , study drug dos may delay study cycle may longer 28 day . You give standard drug ( heparin diphenhydramine ) help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Visits : You hospital 5-7 day begin every cycle , recover side effect may occur . You see doctor `` advanced practice '' nurse every day hospital . At begin cycle week cycle , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . At begin cycle every 4 week ( earlier need ) , physical exam . You scan chest x-ray , CT , MRI , and/or PET scan every 2 cycle ( 8 week ) early study doctor think best interest , cancer get bad . These scan check status disease . If study doctor think appropriate , type scan may need perform . The study doctor discus scan , may ask sign separate consent form . Additional Tests/Procedures Some Participants : If experience severe diarrhea and/or low white blood cell count study , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw test DNA find may high risk side effect irinotecan . If test show may high risk , receive irinotecan low dose level . If Arm C ( discuss , include colorectal cancer patient KRAS mutation ) , leftover sample tumor tissue test KRAS mutation . If leftover tumor tissue earlier procedure available , KRAS status unknown , needle biopsy tumor perform . The tissue test KRAS mutation . This procedure do appropriate tumor area able biopsied , may may liver tumor . This doctor 's decision . Length Study : You may stay study long disease gotten bad , cancer go away completely , experience intolerable side effect . In case , would take study . End-of-Study Visit : About 28 day last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure may perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , x-ray , CT scan , PET scan , -MRI scan check status disease . This investigational study . It investigational give irinotecan liver artery . The study drug combination dose level also investigational . The study drug commercially available FDA approve treat follow : - Irinotecan vein -- colorectal cancer metastatic ( spread ) . - Bevacizumab -- metastatic colorectal cancer , breast cancer , non small-cell lung cancer , type brain cancer call glioblastoma multiforme . - Cetuximab -- colorectal cancer , head neck cancer . - Oxaliplatin -- colorectal cancer . Up 140 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
