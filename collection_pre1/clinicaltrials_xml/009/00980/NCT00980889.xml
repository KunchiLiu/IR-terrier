	<brief_summary>Less 20 % patient malignant distal bile duct ( BD ) obstruction ( often pancreatic cancer ) suitable resection surgery.In rest , palliation treatment come focus . Jaundice cause BD obstruction give pain , infection ( cholangitis ) , often itch increase weight loss , patient stigmatize deep yellow colour skin.Therefore palliation endoscopic stenting ERCP-technique important . Modern self-expanding metal stent ( SEMS ) widely use context . Comparison RCT steel nitinol SEMS never perform . The steel stent ( Wallstent速 ) `` original '' , widely use , expand power . Nitinol stent soft claim easy insert , popular.A newly develop nitinol stent ( Wallflex速 ) may advantage , 120 Euros expensive . Regarding important outcome measure , time stent failure ( obstruction ) , one know difference.Our hypothesis difference main outcome endpoint .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary outcome measure ( compare ) complication cause stent stent insertion technical ease insert stent . To discover 12 % difference 2 group , regard patency , 400 patient must include trial , alfa 0.05 , beta 0.8 . Investigators know previous trial ( Single center trial South Hospital GIE 2006 ; 63:986-995 newly finish similar swedish multicenter trial , prel data DDW- 09 ) 9 hospital recruit able include patient approximately 2.5 year . Investigators shortest follow-up period 10 month , followup phone standard question connect stent failure , define clinically AND new ERCP intervention obstruct stent .</detailed_description>
