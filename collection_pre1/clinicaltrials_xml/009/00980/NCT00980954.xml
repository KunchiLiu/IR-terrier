	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , paclitaxel , carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . It yet know whether chemotherapy radiation therapy effective give without additional chemotherapy treat cervical cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study chemotherapy pelvic radiation therapy see well work give without additional chemotherapy treat patient high-risk early-stage cervical cancer radical hysterectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Pelvic Radiation Therapy With Without Additional Chemotherapy Treating Patients With High-Risk Early-Stage Cervical Cancer After Radical Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine administer adjuvant systemic chemotherapy chemoradiotherapy improve disease-free survival compare chemoradiotherapy alone patient high-risk early-stage cervical carcinoma find positive node and/or positive parametria radical hysterectomy . Secondary - To evaluate adverse event . - To evaluate overall survival . - To evaluate quality life . - To evaluate chemotherapy-induced neuropathy . - To perform post-hoc dose-volume evaluation patient treated standard radiotherapy patient treat intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) respect toxicity local control . - To collect fixed tissue sample identify tumor molecular signature may associate patient outcome , adverse event , disease-free survival , overall survival . - To collect blood sample identify secreted factor serum plasma may associate adverse event outcome identify single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) gene buffy coat may associate genetic predisposition tumor formation response cytotoxic therapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord plan use brachytherapy ( vs. yes ) , radiotherapy modality - [ standard external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) vs. intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) ] , radiotherapy dose ( 45 Gy vs. 50.4 Gy ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo standard EBRT IMRT pelvis daily 5 day week 5-6 week . Patients also receive concurrent cisplatin IV 1 hour weekly 6 week . NOTE : Some patient may also undergo brachytherapy begin within 7 day completion radiotherapy . - Arm II : Patients receive chemoradiotherapy arm I . Beginning 4-6 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - Gynecologic Oncology Group ( FACT-GOG/NTX4 ) , FACT-Cx , FACIT-D questionnaires baseline ; completion chemoradiotherapy ; 6 , 12 , 24 month completion chemoradiotherapy . Blood tissue sample may collect gene expression analysis immuno-histochemistry ( IHC ) biomarker polymorphism study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
