	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify patient high risk develop Acute Lung Injury ( ALI ) time hospital admission , intensive care unit admission . Aim 1- To validate prediction model ( Lung Injury Prediction Score ) population base sample hospitalized patient . Aim 2- To determine significance health-care relate ALI risk modifier population base sample . Aim 3- To compare short long term outcomes patient high risk , develop ALI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute lung injury ( ALI ) example critical care syndrome limit treatment option condition fully established.Not surprisingly , many treatment target mechanism identify preclinical study fail improve patient outcomes.The likely reason could due inadequate delay recognition patient risk subsequent development full blown syndrome.ALI/ARDS usually develop first hour ICU admission , often reason ICU admission . Clinical prediction model extensively use clinical practice identify patient high risk may benefit specific intervention . However , tool exists predict development ALI patient risk . We recently develop ALI prediction model ( Lung Injury Prediction Score : LIPS ) incorporate demographic , environmental clinical characteristic time , , hospital admission . If validate , model serve find population patient high risk ALI future prevention trial conduct . By determine patient high risk also attributable burden ALI/ARDS contemporary cohort patient risk , finding facilitate prioritization preventive strategy future clinical trial .</detailed_description>
