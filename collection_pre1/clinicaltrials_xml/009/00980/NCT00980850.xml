	<brief_summary>In first half year novel Influenza A H1N1 virus result influenza pandemic . The United Kingdom see particularly high incidence disease . The high rate disease see young child . In anticipation influenza pandemic two vaccine manufacturer , Baxter GlaxoSmithKline , gain market authorization approval European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) pandemic strain vaccine `` mockup '' dossier route base limited clinical trial data candidate H5N1 vaccine . This `` mockup '' dossier route pandemic influenza vaccine allow submission core pandemic dossier interpandemic period , result approval mockup pandemic vaccine . This follow fast track approval pandemic vaccine base submission pandemic variation situation arise . The Baxter GlaxoSmithKline vaccine modify cover novel influenza A H1N1 strain . Given high rate swine flu disease child , age group likely particularly benefit immunization virus , however data use vaccine pediatric population . The propose study therefore aim assess immunogenicity , safety , tolerability two H1N1 vaccine administer two dos three week apart child age 6 month 12 year age .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Swine Flu ( Novel Influenza A H1N1 ) Vaccine Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study open label , randomise , parallel group , multicentre clinical trial conduct consortium lead paediatric vaccine research unit United Kingdom . The study recruit healthy child 6 month 12 year age . Children previously laboratory confirmed infection swine flu exclude , receive treatment course oseltamivir . Children immune deficiency egg allergy also exclude . The study conduct collaboration Health Protection Agency follow study recruitment site : Oxford Vaccine Group ( OVG ) , Bristol Children 's Vaccine Centre ( BCVC ) , Royal Devon Exeter Hospital , St George 's Vaccine Institute ( SGVI ) University Southampton Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility ( USWTCRF ) . Families area research sit notify study method include print electronic medium , poster direct mail via child health computer department . The study visit conduct location hospital outpatient , GP surgery , school . General practitioner inform study immunisation administer study , relevant child health computer department . Participants randomise 1:1 basis receive 2 dos either H1N1 influenza vaccine study . These vaccine give 2-3 week apart blood test take baseline around 3 week completion 2 dose immunisation course . If start trial clinical data recommendation JCVI support use half dose either vaccine child 3 year age , use age group ethic committee inform change . Participants ' family give diary card record local systemic reaction vaccine administer , well record daily temperature 7 day receipt vaccine . They telephone 5-7 day vaccination determine SAEs since vaccination remind mail complete diary card HPA . Participants ' family also receive memory card record visit doctor emergency department 8th day vaccine administration next study visit adverse event record diary card ongoing day 7 . There 4 group child study : Group A1 : Children age 6 month le 3 year age receive 2 dos Baxter H1N1 vaccine , 2-3 week apart . A blood sample take baseline around 3 week second vaccine dose . Group B1 : Children age 6 month le 3 year age receive 2 dos GSK H1N1 vaccine , 2-3 week apart . A blood sample take baseline around 3 week second vaccine dose . Group A2 : Children age great 3 year age 12 year age receive 2 dos Baxter H1N1 vaccine , 2-3 week apart . A blood sample take baseline around 3 week second vaccine dose . Group B2 : Children age great 3 year age 12 year age receive 2 dos GSK H1N1 vaccine , 2-3 week apart . A blood sample take baseline around 3 week second vaccine dose .</detailed_description>
