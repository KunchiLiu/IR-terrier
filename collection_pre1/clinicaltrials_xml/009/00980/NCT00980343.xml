	<brief_title>GDC-0449 Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS-6 ) measure start treatment follow surgery . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Toxicity . ( Clinical ) II . Overall survival . ( Clinical ) III . Tumor response ( PR+CR : MacDonald criterion ) . ( Clinical ) IV . Determination vivo drug effect recurrent GBM . ( Correlative study ) V. Determination vitro drug effect CD133+ glioma-derived neurospheres . ( Correlative study ) VI . Determination Sonic Hedgehog pathway activation primary vs. recurrent GBM . ( Correlative study ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Correlate clinical outcome ( 6 mo PFS ) biologic correlate ( 1-3 ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 daily 7 day surgery . Arm II : Patients receive treatment surgery . Beginning within 28 day surgical resection , patient receive oral Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Fresh paraffin-embedded tissue sample collect correlative laboratory study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
