	<brief_summary>People receive allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) likely people get ill germ call Streptococcus pneumoniae . Most people stem cell transplant offer vaccine call 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( 23vPS ) help protect germ . The purpose study evaluate immune response HSCT recipient receive 13 valent pneumococcal vaccine ( 13vPnC ) follow 23vPS .</brief_summary>
