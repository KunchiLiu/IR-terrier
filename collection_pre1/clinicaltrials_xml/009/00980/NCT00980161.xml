	<brief_title>Micro RNA-122 Clinical Course Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection , lead cause cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) liver transplantation , affect approximately 170 million individual worldwide . In Asian-Pacific region , prevalence HCV infection range 0.3-12 % , geographical variation . Therefore , prevention HCV transmission early intervention HCV infection urgently need reduce halt liver-related morbidity mortality . Combination therapy peginterferon plus ribavirin become current standard care chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) patient , overall sustain virologic response ( SVR ) rate 54-63 % . Treatment weekly peginterferon weight-based ribavirin 48 week significantly high SVR rate 24 week Caucasian patient HCV genotype 1 infection ( 52 % 42 % ) . Based ample evidence Western country , 48-week course peginterferon plus weight-based ribavirin therapy widely recommend treat HCV genotype 1 infection different part world . However , recent study Asian CHC genotype 1 patient show favorable treatment response Caucasian patient either 24 48 week peginterferon plus weight-based ribavirin therapy ( 50 60 % 24 week ; 75 80 % 48 week ) . In contrast , overall SVR rate similar across different ethnicity patient HCV genotype 2/3 infection . Despite increased SVR rate improve medical therapy , 25-50 % 10-20 % HCV genotype 1 HCV genotype 2/3 patient may experience relapse cessation therapy undetectable HCV viremia end treatment . Moreover , combination therapy costly may cause various adverse event . Therefore , individualize therapy base outcome analysis adopt save medical cost well lessen inadequate treatment . Currently , HCV viral kinetics consider predict treatment response . Patients rapid virologic response ( RVR ) good predictor SVR ; fail achieve RVR achieve complete partial early virologic response ( cEVR pEVR ) put prolonged therapy ; fail achieve EVR consider treatment discontinuation low chance SVR . Various host viral factor , include race , gender , body weight , baseline viral load , viral genotype , consider predict RVR . However , study aim evaluate host response micro RNA regulation interferon-based therapy relationship overall treatment response . Micro RNA ( miRNA ) single-stand RNA compose 21-23 nucleotide , may regulate function massager RNA ( mRNA ) . The regulating mechanism involve micro RNA host HCV virus include ( 1 ) auto-regulation HCV mRNA HCV miRNA ; ( 2 ) regulation host mRNA HCV miRNA ; ( 3 ) regulation HCV mRNA host miRNA . MiR-122 abundant liver-specific miRNA crucial efficient HCV replication culture Huh7 cell stably express HCV replicons . This observation raise much interest role mir-122 HCV infection potential therapeutic target . It recently report level miR-122 several miRNAs regulate IFN Huh7 cell primary mouse hepatocytes miRNAs might mediate least effect IFN HCV RNA replication vitro . Recently , vivo study hepatic miR-122 42 patient CHC receive IFN-based therapy show patient respond IFN therapy markedly decrease pretreatment miR-122 level . Although miR-122 abundant liver , liver biopsy still consider invasive procedure , prevents widespread use routine clinical practice . Considering abundant blood flow liver , speculate miR-122 detected serum , use screen monitoring response serial blood test . The miRNA detect serum stable 24 hour room temperature store repeat freezing de-freezing . In addition , miRNA resistant RNase sustain 10 year adequate freezing . Recent study show serum miRNA potentially useful detection cancer treatment response . Furthermore , serum miR-122 level reflect severity liver injury rat acetaminophen toxicity model . Because miR-122 liver specific miRNA stable serum , investigator aim evaluate role serum hepatic miR-122 viral kinetics treatment response HCV patient receive peginterferon ribavirin combination therapy .</detailed_description>
