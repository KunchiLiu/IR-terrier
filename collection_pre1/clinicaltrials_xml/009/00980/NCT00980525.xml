	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine certain level protein lead inflammation gum . One example proteins study call Interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) . This protein find high level area inflammation . This type study call experimental gingivitis study . It involve stop routine oral health care 21 day . If qualify , receive full dental clean begin end study . Approximately 30 patient participate study Michigan Center Oral Health Research ( MCOHR ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gingivitis specific oral infectious disease affect approximately 50 % adult population average 3 4 teeth . Although dental plaque primary etiology periodontal disease , patient equally susceptible respond similarly professional care . Therefore , assess future risk patient develop gingivitis possible subsequent progression chronic periodontitis may help clinician elaborate accurate suitable treatment plan patient well assessment prognosis . In fact , prevention plaque-induced gingivitis still consider first step maintenance periodontal health . Experimental gingivitis use widely study microbiology event occur transition state gingival health inflammation . In classical study Löe Theilade , periodontally healthy subject ask cease form oral hygiene 3-4 week . Studies level proinflammatory biomarkers increase interest past decade . Since change level salivary biomarkers occur prior clinical sign gingivitis , measurement may provide objective , early accurate assessment gingival inflammatory change compare traditional bleeding plaque index . Despite clinical significance gingivitis , little know correlation level salivary biomarkers , presence periodontal pathogens IL-1 polymorphism , affect susceptibility gingivitis . If IL-1 polymorphism indeed associate increased level pro-inflammatory cytokine expression presence specific periodontal pathogen , screen polymorphism valuable necessary tool . As periodontal treatment , scale root planing , show successful decreasing level IL-1 gingival crevicular fluid , aggressive treatment regimen may warrant patient genotype positive . If biomarkers saliva plaque biofilm serve accurate predictor gingivitis , ability early detection disease patient enhance . Pro-inflammatory salivary biomarkers , specific pathogenic bacteria genotype aid establish accurate diagnostic prognostic parameter periodontal disease , compare current parameter ( e.g . probe pocket depth , clinical attachment loss ... ) reflect history rather present future status disease . As consequence , intervention initiate prior irreversible tissue breakdown oral health care cost may reduce . Research effort future direct toward establishment affordable practical chairside salivary test .</detailed_description>
