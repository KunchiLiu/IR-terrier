	<detailed_description>In clinical trial subject enrol , suffer pain due osteoarthritis hip knee sufficiently control either non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) paracetamol weak opioid . This clinical trial test pain relieve effectiveness OROS hydromorphone , once-daily formulation strong opioid placebo patient , previously receive strong opioids . The drug class opioid analgesic broadly classify strong weak . Weak opioids ( example tramadol , codeine , dihydrocodeine tilidine ) useful mild moderate pain strong opioids ( example morphine , fentanyl hydromorphone ) useful moderate severe pain different origin . OROS hydromorphone opioid , available prolonged-release tablet different dosage strength . The primary aim study test efficacy OROS hydromorphone placebo individual dose sufficient control pain establish usefulness new low-dose formulation OROS hydromorphone ( 4 mg hydromorphone per tablet ) initiate treatment dose titration . The clinical trial test effect treatment symptom pain , stiffness physical function . The effect treatment parameter health relate quality life well quality sleep measure . The safety treatment record measure blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate.This clinical trial placebo-controlled trial , mean one group patient receive drug test ( OROS hydromorphone ) control group receive optically identical tablet active ingredient , so-called placebo . A total number 270 patient enrol clinical trial assign one two treatment arm equal ratio ( i.e . 135 patient per treatment ) . Patients randomly assign one two treatment arm , like flip coin decide treatment receive .
