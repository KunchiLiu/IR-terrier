	<brief_summary>Approximately 30,000 new patient introduce dialysis 20,000 die every year Japan . At present , 300,000 patient dialysis 10,000 patient register Japan Organ Transplant Network ( JOTN ) hope renal transplantation . If renal function restore transplantation , quality life ( QOL ) improve 90 % reportedly come back normal life activity get relieve burden dialysis . Furthermore , reduce dialysis relate medical cost much 50 % . However , 1,000 renal transplantation case annually carry Japan . Among , 80-85 % live renal transplantation offer family member relative , rest decease donor . Due fact number decease donor scarce renal transplantation non-relatives ( third party ) currently allow Japan , approximate wait time receive renal transplantation 16 year . For reason , many patient travel abroad receive renal transplantation . There report total nephrectomy perform treatment small size ( 4 cm less ) renal tumor many case many nephrectomized kidney successfully transplant surgical restoration satisfactory result . However , due lack necessary evidence currently allow Japan . Therefore , investigator plan present clinical study evaluate curative efficacy ( renal function , QOL ) safety ( side effect , complication occurence renal cancer ) live renal transplantation third party ( non-relatives ) restore donor kidney surgical removal small size ( 4 cm less ) renal tumor , order acquire necessary clinical data potential enrichment renal donor pool Japan well develop useful medical care patient dialysis many year due renal failure .</brief_summary>
