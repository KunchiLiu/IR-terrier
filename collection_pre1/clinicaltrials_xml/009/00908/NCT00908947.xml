	<detailed_description>The study prospective , multi-center , single-arm , non-randomized study enrol 234 subject lifestyle-limiting claudication ischemic rest pain attributable lesion ( ) ( stenosed , occlude , restenosed , re-occluded ) infra-inguinal segment ( SFA and/or proximal popliteal artery ) amenable treatment PTA stenting . All subject enrol study receive PTA stenting .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . The subject provide write informed consent use Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) review approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) site . 2 . Subject agree comply protocolmandated followup procedure visit . 3 . The subject ≥ 21 year old . 4 . Male female subject ; female subject childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test time screen . 5 . The subject lifestylelimiting claudication ischemic rest pain define : Rutherford Category 24 . 6 . The target lesion ( ) angiographic evidence stenosis restenosis ≥ 50 % occlusion ( visual estimate ) amenable PTA stenting . 7 . The total target lesion ( ) length must ≤ 240 mm . 8 . The target vessel reference diameter ≥ 4.0 mm ≤ 6.5 mm ( visual estimate ) , therefore appropriate treatment available stent diameter 6.0 mm 7.0 mm . 1 . The subject unable unwilling provide inform consent , unable unwilling conform study protocol followup procedures visit . 2 . The subject claudication critical limb ischemia describe Rutherford Category 1 ( mild claudication ) , 5 ( minor tissue loss ) 6 ( major tissue loss . 3 . The subject multiple stenosis occlusion &gt; 240 mm . 4 . The subject previous stent stent graft locate target vessel . 5 . The subject flowlimiting stenosis occlusion inflow tract adequately correct ( ≤ 30 % residual stenosis ) prior treatment target lesion ( ) . Investigator standard care practice shall utilized treatment inflow . 6 . The subject know contraindication ( include allergic reaction ) antiplatelet/anticoagulant medication , nickel , titanium , tantalum sensitivity . 7 . The subject know contraindication contrast medium amenable pretreatment steroid or/and antihistamine . 8 . The subject known history bleeding diatheses coagulopathy . 9 . The subject concomitant renal failure creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL . 10 . The subject currently dialysis receive systemic immunosuppressive therapy . 11 . The subject know concomitant hepatic insufficiency , thrombophlebitis , uremia , systemic lupus erythematosus , septicemia deep vein thrombosis time index procedure . 12 . The subject currently participate investigational drug another investigational device study complete primary endpoint , clinically interfere study endpoint . Note : trial require extend followup product investigational , since become commercially available , consider investigational trial . 13 . The subject another medical condition , , opinion Investigator , may cause him/her noncompliant protocol , confound data interpretation , associate life expectancy insufficient allow completion study procedure followup . 14 . The subject extensive peripheral vascular disease , opinion Investigator , would preclude safe insertion introducer sheath . 15 . The target lesion ( ) locate within aneurysm associate aneurysm vessel segment either proximal distal target lesion ( ) . 16 . There angiographic evidence unresolved thrombus target lesion ( ) within target vessel resolve infusion thrombolytic and/or mechanical thrombectomy ( use approve device ) without adverse events/complications . 17 . The subject undergone noniliac percutaneous intervention ( ) &lt; 7 day prior index procedure .</criteria>
