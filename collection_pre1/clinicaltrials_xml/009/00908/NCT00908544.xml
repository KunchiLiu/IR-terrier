	<brief_title>New Era Study : Treatment With Multi Drug Class ( MDC ) HAART HIV Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Recruitment Treatment : Recruitment stratify accord stage HIV-infection pre-treatment : - Stratum I ( PHI patient ) : Patients present primary HIV infection - Stratum II ( CHR patient ) : Chronically HIV-infected patient suppress plasma viral load ≥36 month continuous HAART CHR PHI patient treat antiretroviral combination five approved substance ( Multi-Drug Class HAART= MDC HAART ) . Every regimen contain Maraviroc Raltegravir . MDC HAART consist : 2 NRTI + 1PI + 1 CCR5 antagonist ( = Maraviroc ; MVC ) + 1 INI ( = Raltegravir ; RAL ) . The patient PHI-group immediately treat MDC HAART duration ≥5-7 year . The patient CHR-group treat MDC HAART 6-month observational lead-in phase measure laboratory parameter . Then HAART intensify respective miss drug class MDC HAART ( MVC+RAL ) . The respective treatment time &gt; 2-4 year . Dosing antiretrovirals include study drug Raltegravir Maraviroc accord standard dosing outline respective product information ( attach ) . - Patients take Raltegravir 400 mg ( one 400 mg tablet ) PO b.i.d . ( without regard food ) . Raltegravir take time day take time day . - Patients take Maraviroc 150 mg ( one 150 mg tablet ) PO b.i.d . ( without regard food ) co-administered PI RTV-boosted Lopinavir , RTV-boosted Atazanavir , RTV-boosted Saquinavir , RTV-boosted Darunavir . Patients take Maraviroc 300 mg ( two 150 mg tablet ) PO b.i.d . ( without regard food ) co-administered PI Fosamprenavir Tipranavir The duration study 5-7 year PHI patient 2.5 - 7.5 year CHR patient . In treatment group NRTI´s PI´s replace NRTI´s PI´s case intolerability reason discretion investigator . Other treatment initiate treat physician may potential impact viral reservoir ( like valproic acid ) immunomodulators discourage course study . If new antiretroviral agent approve available expanded access program course study might beneficial study patient discretion treat physician , treatment regimen modify base current knowledge ( =addition new antiretroviral agent replacement drug regimen ) . Patients exclude study unless reach virological endpoint . 2 . Study Procedures : Each potential patient inform study content investigator sign inform consent he/she want participate study . Then Each patient assign unique allocation number first screen visit . A single patient assign one allocation number . Allocation number provide coordinate study centre . Patients meet eligibility requirement start medication baseline . Monitoring patient safety perform study visit ; Specific laboratory measure perform single visit month 6 patient . Visit time schedule : - PHI-group : Screening/Baseline , Month 1 , Month 3 , Month 6 follow half-yearly - CHI-group : Month -6 ( Screening ) , Month -3 ( Pre-baseline ) , Baseline , Month 1 , Month 6 follow half-yearly Post Tx visit pre-mature regular discontinuation ( include HAART interruption due eradication , define . Follow-up visit post Tx ( PFU1 , PFU2 , PFU3 ) foreseen month 3 , 6 12 . According New Era study protocol , treatment interrupted case reach undetectability HIV-1 RNA plasma proviral DNA PMBC . Because need virologic , immunologic genetic marker well predict virus control treatment interruption , approve Amendment ( MUC_NewEra_v3.3 Protocol : EudraCT : 2008-002070-35 date : 6.11.2014 ) foreseen conduct one additional blood sample aim well characterize discriminate New Era patient term immunologic , virologic laboratory parameter 3 . Safety Management : At visit , safety measurement clinical chemistry , hematology virology physical examination conduct . All adverse event record . Treatment naïve ( PHI ) female patient childbearing potential pregnancy test perform Screening , Baseline , Month 1 , Month 3 , Month 6 follow half-yearly Month 90 . Pretreated ( CHI ) female patient childbearing potential pregnancy test perform Screen , 6 Month prior Baseline , 3 Month prior Baseline , Baseline , Month 1 , Month 3 , Month 6 follow half-yearly Month 54 . Serious Adverse Events ( SAE´s ) : Any serious adverse experience , whether suspect causal relationship investigational product ( include death due cause ) , occur subject/patient enter study within 14 day follow cessation treatment within establish therapy follow-up period safety describe protocol , whether related investigational product , must report within 24 hour one individual ( ) list sponsor . For serious adverse experience Serious Adverse Experience/Pregnancy/Overdose Case Report Form ( SAE Form ) complete . In addition , every single SAE record respective study visit Case Report Form . Each SAE fully investigate , drug relate , decision make whether risk/benefit warrant patient´s continuation study . Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction´s ( SUSAR 's ) : The Sponsor report SUSARs accord standard report SUSARs define 'Detailed guidance collection , verification presentation adverse reaction report arise clinical trial medicinal product human use - April 2006 ' accordance applicable global law regulation . SUSAR report include information require accord Council International Organizations Medical Sciences CIOMS I report form . The Sponsor non-commercial Marketing Authorization Holder ( MAH ) Investigational Medicinal Products ( IMPs ) report relevant information suspect unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSAR ) occur course clinical trial fatal life-threatening soon possible competent authority ( Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte , BfArM ) , relevant Ethics Committees , investigator manufacturer study drug . This need do later 7 day Sponsor first aware reaction . Any additional relevant information send within 8 day report . A Sponsor report unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSAR ) fatal life-threatening soon possible , event later 15 day Sponsor first aware reaction . The sponsor inform investigator concerned finding could adversely affect safety study subject . If appropriate , information aggregate line listing SUSARs period volume SUSARs generate . This line list accompanied concise summary evolve safety profile investigational medicinal product . If significant safety issue identify , either upon receipt individual case report upon review aggregate data , sponsor issue soon possible communication investigator . A safety issue impact upon course clinical study development project , include suspension study program safety-related amendment study protocol also report investigator . Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) : The study monitor independent external Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) / Data Monitoring Committee ( DMB ) . The DSMB provide recommendation Oversight Committee . The Oversight Committee ( consist sponsor coordinate investigator Dr. med . Hans Jaeger principal investigator Prof. Johannes Bogner ) provide overall scientific direction trial , receive decide recommendation make DSMB . The Oversight Committee must approve scientific report concern main finding trial . The membership , procedure , function responsibility Oversight Committee DSMB identify New Era DSMB Charter . Annual Safety Report ( ASR ) : In addition expedite reporting require SUSAR , Sponsor submit year throughout clinical trial ( request ) safety report competent authority ( BfArM ) , relevant Ethics Committees concerned Member States . 4 . Data Analysis : This proof-of-concept study use small , targeted number subject carry determine eradication HIV possible . A design placebo discourage light possible eradication . The chronically infected patient serve control . Prior baseline , patient monitor persistently suppressive HAART last already least 36 month switch multi-drug class HAART . Based assumption , MDC ( multi-drug class ) HAART Raltegravir Maraviroc lead mean reduction least one 1 log patient PHI assume standard deviation 1 95 % confidence interval ( 0.5-1.5 log ) width 1 , sample size calculate ≥16 ( assumption normal distribution ) . Intensification HAART Raltegravir Maraviroc chronically infect HIV-patients may similar effect ( Ramratnam B , J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr 2004 ; 35:33-37 ) . Sample size calculation use also chronically infected HIV-patients . A sample size 40 patient ( 20 primary infect patient ( Stratum I , PHI ) 20 chronically infected patient ( Stratum II , CHR ) chosen . Drop-outs first 12 month replace . In course study gender specific difference expect . The application Maraviroc Raltegravir differ male female patient . The proportion male female patient probably accordance epidemiologic data Germany . Hypothesis : The hypothesis study , MDC HAART , mean reduction proviral DNA 1 log achieve 36 month . Null hypotheses H0 : Mean reduction proviral DNA &lt; 1 log . Alternative hypothesis H1 : Mean reduction proviral DNA ≥1 log Level significance : 0.05 Statistical test : One-tailed paired t-test MUC_NewEra_v3.3 Protocol : EudraCT : 2008-002070-35 date : 6.11.2014 page 27 The null hypotheses reject p-value test less significance level ( 0.05 ) . The null hypothesis accept p-value test great 0.05 . Statistical Methods : For accept reject primary hypothesis ( trial , one-tailed pair t-test use .
