	<brief_title>Prevention Contrast Induced Nephropathy ( NIC ) Intravenous Versus Oral Rehydration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To compare efficacy oral versus intravenous hydration prevention contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) inpatients different renal function equal type volume contrast . Methods : The clinical trial include 324 patient GFR high equal 30 ml/min receive intravenous contrast ( Iohexol : 300 mg l/ml ; approximate volume : 120 ml 2-5ml/second ) follow 12-24 hour . Patients inclusion criterion , previously sign consent form , randomise 3 group ( intravenous hydration , oral hydration ) . Intravenous hydration carry bicarbonate 1/6M one hour test ( 3ml/Kg/h ) oral hydration Casen solution carry 4 hour ( 75 ml/10 kg ) intravenous contrast administration . In relation hydrate , point , procedure would carry without study . The follow-up renal function carry measure creatinine cystatin C blood GFR pre- 24 hour test . It also determine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( N-GAL ) , IL-8 F2-Isoprostanes level urine superoxide dismutase activity erythrocytes , pre- different post- test time . Also , vitro , effect contrast NADPH-oxidase activity PBLs isolate 30 control patient also study ( 10 patient group ) .</detailed_description>

The GFR estimate formula Modification Diet Renal Diseases Study ( MDRD ) . Patients undergoing : cardiac catheterization proceed contrast previous week , colonoscopy 48 hour receive prior nephrotoxic ( aminoglycosides / certain chemotherapeutic agent ) 2448 hour test hour .</criteria>
