	<brief_title>Studying Tumor Tissue Samples From Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Localized Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To identify consistent pattern VEGF expression , E-cadherin regulation , matrix metalloproteinase 2 9 activity , carbonic anhydrase 9 activity predictive factor development aggressive tumor behavior tumor tissue sample patient localize clear cell renal cell carcinoma . OUTLINE : Previously collect tumor tissue sample examine immunohistochemistry level expression five different factor related aggressive tumor behavior ( i.e. , VEGF expression , E-cadherin regulation , matrix metalloproteinase 2 9 activity , carbonic anhydrase 9 activity ) . Samples compare positive tissue control ( i.e. , VEGF- tonsil ; E- cadherin-normal breast endometrium ; MMP2- placenta ) negative control ( i.e. , isotype match normal serum ) identify consistent pattern expression/activity factor . Levels expression quantify 5-level score ( 0 4 scale ) differences two area tumor analyze .</detailed_description>
