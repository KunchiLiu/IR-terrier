	<brief_title>Treatment With Velcade ( Bortezomib ) Plus Dexamethasone ( VD ) VD Plus Cyclophosphamide VD Plus Lenalidomide Patients With Multiple Myeloma Stabilized After 4 Cycles VD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It show quality response correspond clinical benefit . Stable disease regard satisfactory result therapy relapse refractory multiple myeloma . However , consensus , treatment continue changed case stable disease . There different strategy achieve optimal quality response relapse refractory multiple myeloma . One treat long duration one regimen . The alternative path sequential approach add another agent initial regimen depend outcome therapy define treatment period . These two principle evaluate present study . Both Cyclophosphamide Lenalidomide proven efficacious multiple myeloma combination agent bortezomib Dexamethasone show active tolerable . In study patient relapsed/progressive refractory multiple myeloma start treatment bortezomiib Dexamethasone . Response evaluate four cycle . Patients complete , good partial response partial response continue treatment initiate . Patients stable disease either continue treatment bortezomib/Dexamethasone combination another four cycle receive Cyclophosphamide Lenalidomide additional third agent another four cycle . Patients multiple myeloma refractory relapsed/progressed primary treatment multiple myeloma enrol study . All patient receive combination bortezomib plus dexamethasone total four cycle . Based response treatment , study treatment customize . Patients complete , good partial partial response continue receive bortezomib Dexamethasone maximum additional four cycle , overall maximum eight cycle . Patients achieve stable disease , define International Myeloma Working Group 2006 ( IMWG 2006 ) response criterion , undergo central randomisation continue treatment VD VD plus cyclophosphamide VD plus lenalidomide . Patients progressive disease go study treatment . After randomisation , patient receive therapy four additional treatment cycle , overall maximum eight cycle . Each cycle consist three week treatment . There long-term follow-up period monthly visit relapse progressive disease . Thereafter follow-up survival continue least phone call every month . This perform patient last patient treat follow 1 year . Safety assess monitor adverse event , physical examination ( include neurological/peripheral neurological examination ) , pulmonary examination , vital sign measurement , clinical laboratory test . Patients treat 3-week cycle , maximum 8 cycle bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 administer day 1 , 4 , 8 11 i.v . bolus infusion . Dexamethasone 20 mg po administer day 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 . Dexamethasone administer 2 table 8 mg plus 1 tablet 4 mg Cyclophosphamide 500 mg po administer 10 tablet 50 mg day 1 , 8 , 15 Lenalidomide administer daily 10 mg tablet day 1 14</detailed_description>
