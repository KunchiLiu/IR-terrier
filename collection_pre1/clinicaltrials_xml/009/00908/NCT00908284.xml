	<brief_title>Evaluating Exercise Program Reduce Cardiovascular Risk Factors Children Infected With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People infect HIV living longer healthy live HIV-infected people previous generation widespread use HAART medication . However , HIV infection become chronic illness , rather fatal disease , researcher begin identify long-term complication HIV infection treatment . Adults infect HIV increasingly develop follow : hyperlipidemia dyslipidemia , associate high cholesterol level ; endothelial dysfunction ; insulin resistance ; change body composition , include increase obesity level increase central body fat . These condition associate increase risk cardiovascular disease . More research need examine child infect HIV receive HAART may affect condition . In study , researcher examine child infect HIV receive HAART ( well control group child infect HIV ) evaluate vascular function inflammation time affect body composition , fat redistribution , insulin resistance , hyperlipidemia , growth , nutrition , bone metabolism , disease severity . This study also evaluate effectiveness exercise program vascular function cardiovascular outcomes child infect HIV receive HAART . There two part study . In Part 1 , child infect HIV sibling friend infected HIV attend study visit every 6 month 3 year . At select visit , follow study procedure occur : medical history review ; physical exam ; blood collection ; body measurement ; questionnaire regard diet , quality life , activity level ; echocardiogram obtain image heart . In Part 2 study , portion participant Part 1 study infect HIV randomly assign take part 12-week exercise program control group . At baseline study visit , participant undergo medical history review , fitness testing , body measurement , muscle fat measurement , blood collection , echocardiogram , questionnaires assess quality life activity level , ultrasound brachial artery ( upper arm ) carotid artery ( neck ) measure artery size . Participants exercise program exercise ( e.g. , walk , run , cycling , stretch , weight training ) 1 hour study exercise laboratory 2 day week 12 week . If participant come laboratory , may exercise home , guidance study researcher . Participants wear pedometer select day keep activity log record far walk . At end 12-week program , participant undergo repeat baseline test . They also receive write , personalized exercise program follow . Participants receive weekly phone call study researcher attend study visit month 3 month follow-up monitoring . Baseline test occur end 3-month follow-up period . Participants control group attend group session week 12 week time watch video , include exercise video , play game require physical activity . At end Week 12 , participant undergo repeat baseline test . They option take part exercise program .</detailed_description>
