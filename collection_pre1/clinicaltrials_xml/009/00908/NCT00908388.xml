	<criteria>1 . Presence acute complicate type B aortic dissection : Dissection acute Time symptom onset dissection diagnosis ≤14 day Dissection complicate Subject must present least one following : Rupture set aortic dissection define hemorrhage outside aortic boundary note CT scan ( hemorrhage must differentiate reactive effusion investigator , equivocal , elevated Hounsefield unit determine radiologist ) . Clinical evidence malperfusion , set aortic dissection , define : Clinical radiographic evidence visceral hypoperfusion . Clinical radiographic evidence renal hypoperfusion . Clinical radiographic evidence low extremity hypoperfusion . Clinical radiographic evidence spinal cord hypoperfusion . Dissection type B Entire dissection distal leave subclavian artery Primary Treatment Indication Class 1 Aortic Dissection 46 Classical aortic dissection intimal flap true false lumen double barrel flow thoracic aorta Subjects multiple entry tear allow enrol study 2 . Age 18 80 year 3 . Primary treatment endovascular treatment CTAG device . Adjunctive treatment may include left subclavian artery revascularization , percutaneous fenestration , aortic stenting , peripheral vessel stenting , surgical fenestration , and/or peripheral artery bypass 4 . Proximal land zone characteristic include : Proximal extent intend proximal land zone dissect Length ≥ 2.0 cm proximal primary entry tear Transaortic diameter proximal extent intend land zone 1642 mm ( diameter assess flow lumen thrombus , present ; calcium exclude ) Can aneurysmal , heavily calcify , excessive intraluminal thrombus Must native aorta May include leave subclavian artery , necessary 5 . Subject capable complying protocol requirement , include followup 6 . Informed Consent Form sign subject legal representative 1 . Primary treatment indication Class 25 aortic dissection ( intramural hematoma , limited dissection , penetrate atherosclerotic ulcer , iatrogenic dissection , traumatic dissection ) 46 2 . Concomitant aneurysm/disease ascend aorta , aortic arch , abdominal aorta require repair ( dissection extension abdominal aorta acceptable ) 3 . Prior repair DTA 4 . Infected aorta 5 . Subject systemic infection may increase risk endovascular graft infection 6 . Persistent refractory shock ( systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg ) 7 . Bowel necrosis ( Bowel necrosis characterize direct observation surgical exploration , elevate serum lactate level CT finding portal venous gas , free intraabdominal gas , pneumatosis intramural gas , poor mucosal enhancement thicken bowel wall ) 8 . Renal failure , define baseline creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dl 9 . ASA risk classification = V ( Moribund patient expect live 24 hour without operation ) 10 . Pregnant female 11 . Major surgery within 30 day treatment ( left subclavian artery bypass transposition ) 12 . Degenerative connective tissue disease , e.g. , Marfan EhlerDanlos Syndrome 13 . Treatment another drug medical device study within 1 year study enrollment 14 . History stimulant abuse , e.g. , cocaine amphetamine , within 1 year treatment 15 . Tortuous stenotic iliac and/or femoral artery inability use conduit vascular access 16 . Planned coverage leave carotid celiac artery CTAG device 17 . The planned endovascular procedure involve alteration CTAG device 18 . Subject known sensitivity allergies device material</criteria>
