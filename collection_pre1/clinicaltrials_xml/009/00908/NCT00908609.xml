	<brief_summary>The investigator propose validate utility novel hybrid imaging technique accurate diagnosis breast lesion , assess chemotherapy response cancer treatment predict treatment efficacy . The investigator ' unique hybrid technique implement simultaneously deploy near infrared ( NIR ) optical sensor commercial ultrasound ( US ) transducer mount hand-held probe , utilize co-registered lesion structure information provide ultrasound improve optical tomography . As result , optical tomography assist US overcome problem associate intense light scatter provide reliable tumor angiogenesis distribution . Initial result small group patient underwent biopsy show early stage invasive cancer present two-fold great total hemoglobin concentration average fibroadenomas benign lesion . Initial result advance cancer show angiogenesis distribution highly distort heterogeneous , distorted distribution correlate histological microvessel density count use assess chemotherapy response . The objective study validate investigator ' initial result NIR light guide ultrasound improve breast cancer diagnosis monitor chemotherapy response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific objective study : Objective 1 : Validate sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value negative predictive value optical tomography/US distinguish benign early stage malignant breast tumor . Approximately 300 patient undergo ultrasound-guided biopsy recruit study University Connecticut Health Center Hartford Hospital . The total hemoglobin concentration blood oxygen saturation measure index biopsy result use 'gold ' standard . Objective 2 : Perform pilot study optical tomography/US ass chemotherapy response evaluate treatment efficacy . Patients diagnose locally advanced breast cancer ( size great 3 cm ) undergo chemotherapy enrol study . Approximately , 20 30 patient recruit study University Connecticut Health Center Hartford Hospital .</detailed_description>
