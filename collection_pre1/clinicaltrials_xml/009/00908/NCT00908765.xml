	<brief_summary>Reduced exercise tolerance one hallmark COPD . The principal cause exercise intolerance ventilatory limitation lead deconditioning inactivity . So far poorly understood form exercise effective training condition . The investigator want study physiological response two different train program ( High intensity aerobe interval training moderate continuous aerobe train ) special focus cardiac skeletal muscle adaption</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Reduced exercise tolerance one hallmark COPD The principal cause exercise intolerance ventilatory limitation lead deconditioning inactivity . However weak correlation exercise capacity FEV1 imply factor reduce pulmonary function contributes impairment . Several study find change skeletal muscle , fibre shift , increase oxidative stress , increase inflammatory cytokine impair mitochondrial function , suggest low limb dysfunction Numerous exercise study COPD patient show physiological physiological benefit train endurance training regard important part pulmonary rehabilitation . It still uncertain type endurance training favourable COPD patient . In patient heart failure metabolic syndrome aerobe interval exercise show superior improve aerobic capacity cardiac function We therefore want conduct study compare training effect patient moderate severe COPD , participate identical training program HF metabolic syndrome patient give significant improvement aerobic capacity , cardiac function skeletal muscle function . Patients therefore assign either 4x4 minute high intensity interval treadmill exercise continuous moderate intensity treadmill exercise 3 time pr week 12 week . Aerobic capacity work economy , pulmonary , cardiac skeletal muscle function exercise training measure .</detailed_description>
