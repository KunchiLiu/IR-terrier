	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effectiveness use Bevacizumab prevention recurrent malignant ascites . Ascites debilitate unpleasant complication several type cancer . Animal laboratory study show tumor cell production and/or increase amount Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) major cause formation malignant ascites . Therefore , give patient malignant ascites drug target neutralize VEGF prevent recurrence malignant ascites follow paracentesis ( procedure remove fluid abdominal cavity ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Bevacizumab Prevent Malignant Ascites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subject treat intravenous infusion experimental drug ( Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg ) every 3 week total twelve ( 12 ) week study . The primary endpoint time need repeat abdominal paracentesis start therapy . Secondary endpoint include analysis mean number paracenteses require subject course 3 month , determination repeat paracentesis response rate ( proportion subject double baseline time repeat paracentesis ) assessment effect treatment quality life use subject questionnaire .</detailed_description>
