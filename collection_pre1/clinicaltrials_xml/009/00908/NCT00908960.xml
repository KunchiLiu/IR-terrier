	<brief_summary>Research study show strong association cancer blood clot vein ( also know deep vein thrombosis ) . These blood clot flow lung ( pulmonary embolism ) severe case may life threaten . The purpose research study see enoxaparin effective prevent blood clot vein participant cancer pancreas , colorectal , non-small cell lung , ovary , gastric also high level tissue factor bearing microparticles blood ( TFMP ) . TFMP small particle generate different type blood cell body . In people cancer , TFMP think generate cancer cell may represent risk factor deep vein thrombosis . Enoxaparin use prevent formation blood clot patient abdominal orthopedic surgery patient suffer severe medical illness . Based study , investigate see prevents thrombosis people certain type cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Because one know study option best , participant randomize one follow study group . Participants high level TFMP blood one two arm indicate . - Arm A ( High TFMP ) : Enoxaparin give subcutaneously ( skin ) daily 2 month , low extremity ultrasound perform 2 month . - Arm B ( High TFMP ) : Observation , low extremity ultrasound perform 2 month . - Arm C ( Low TFMP ) : Observation , low extremity ultrasound perform 2 month . - At 2 month , participant physical examination ask question general health specific question problem might . They also lower extremity ultrasound blood test perform 2 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm malignancy metastatic unresectable standard curative therapy exist . Eligible malignancy include : Adenocarcinoma pancreas ( locally advance metastatic ) Colorectal ( stage IV ) Nonsmall cell lung ( unresectable stage III IV ) Relapsed ovarian stage IV Surgically unresectable metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma First second line therapy ( within 4 week initiate therapy ) . Minimum age 18 year Life expectancy great 6 month ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 ( Karnofsky 60 % great ) . Participants must normal organ marrow function outline protocol . Participants may receive study agent . Known brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis higher potential intracranial hemorrhage . Prior history document venous thromboembolic event pulmonary embolism within last 5 year year ( exclude central line associate event whereby patient complete anticoagulation &gt; 3 month previously ) Active bleed high risk bleeding ( e.g . know acute gastrointestinal ulcer ) Any history significant hemorrhage ( require hospitalization transfusion ) outside surgical setting within last 5 year History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition enoxaparin heparin . History heparininduced thrombocytopenia Presence coagulopathy ( PT PTT &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ) Familial bleed diathesis Known diagnosis disseminate intravascular coagulation Currently receive anticoagulant therapy Current use aspirin ( &gt; 81mg daily ) , Clopidogrel ( Plavix ) , cilostazol ( Pletal ) , aspirindipyridamole ( Aggrenox ) , regular use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent twice weekly . Maximum dose ibuprofen 400mg twice per week . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
