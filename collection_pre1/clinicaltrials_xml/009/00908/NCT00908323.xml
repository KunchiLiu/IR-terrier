	<brief_summary>HVTN 908 sub study HIV vaccine trial , HVTN 205 . The purpose sub study well understand person 's immune system respond vaccine , particularly HIV vaccine . More specifically , researcher determine whether early response immune system help predict strong long-lasting immunity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Immune Responses Vaccination - A Substudy HVTN 205</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some first HIV vaccine design trigger neutralize antibody responses way prevent HIV infection . Unfortunately , first version vaccine able achieve desire response . An alternative strategy antibody approach stimulation HIV-specific CD8 T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) responses . CTL responses previously demonstrate play important role control simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) , HIV equivalent study rhesus macaque monkey . Additionally , study suggest CTLs play important role viral control chronic infection . Based information , several group shift focus development CTL-based vaccine , enter advanced clinical trial . A DNA/rMVA vaccine strategy structure bring T cell antibody responses . The primary vaccination DNA base express HIV proteins way produce HIV-focused immune response . A secondary , rMVA boost vaccination , express HIV MVA proteins ideally amplify focused response initial vaccination . The DNA rMVA physically two different vaccination give separate time together make one preventive regimen . Both vaccine component express non-infectious virus-like particle . The main study , HVTN 205 evaluate safety immune response two vaccine regimen healthy , HIV-uninfected adult never receive HIV preventive vaccine . HVTN 205 include two part , Part A , two vaccine regimen compare placebo , Part B , two vaccine regimen compare placebo single vaccine regimen rMVA vaccine . HVTN 908 sub study HVTN 205 , explore innate immune response candidate HIV vaccine . In particular , researcher study whether early immune response follow vaccination predict strong long-lasting immunity . They also study whether vary type vaccine promote different immune response soon vaccination . Only participant enrol HVTN 205 eligible HVTN 908 . Approximately 50 participant recruit duration 12 month per participant . The study last total 2 year , include enrollment , follow-up , analysis . Potential participant sub study undergo screen visit eligibility determine . Screening may involve physical exam , health history , blood test . There additional visit participant HVTN 908 include main study . Some main study visit may also take extra time participant enrol sub study . Blood sample take study visit . These sample take addition main study .</detailed_description>
