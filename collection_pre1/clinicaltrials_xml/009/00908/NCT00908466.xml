	<brief_summary>The purpose study find safety effectiveness study drug , sirolimus , patient uveitis utilize potential effectiveness sirolimus , yet avoid potential complication systemic use drug . In study , investigator administer sirolimus either around ( subconjunctival injection ) inside eye ( intravitreal injection ) . Local administration sirolimus eye expect effect rest body . Therefore , may offer safe way current method use control inflammation cause non-infectious uveitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sirolimus Therapeutic Approach Uveitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uveitis condition certain part eye become inflamed . The inflammation usually recurrent . If inflammation treat adequately , permanent damage eye vision may occur . The inflammation cause infectious non infectious cause . The current research do determine safety usefulness treatment non-infectious uveitis use drug call sirolimus . Current treatment option uveitis include oral corticosteroid drug weaken immune system body ( i.e. , immunosuppressant drug ) . Treatment use oral corticosteroid , especially long period , may cause many undesirable side effect complication high blood sugar , high blood pressure , bone weakness , obesity , stomach ulcer , abnormal hair growth , increase risk infection . In addition , case , disease control even high dose steroid . Injection steroid around inside eye use control uveitis . However , inflammation always respond kind treatment . The eye may develop high pressure cataract injection steroid eye around eye . On hand , despite potential effectiveness , treatment drug weaken immune system may cause severe side effect . Increased risk infection common side effect immunosuppressant drug . The immune system protect body infection . When immune system suppress , infection likely happen . Some infection potentially dangerous . Because immune system protect body form cancer , immunosuppressant drug also associate slightly increase risk cancer . For example , long-term use immunosuppressant drug may carry increase risk develop skin cancer result combination drug exposure sunlight . The immunosuppressive drug powerful cause serious side effect high blood pressure , kidney problem , liver problem . Some side effect may show year medicine use .</detailed_description>

Have inactive disease , define 0.5+ Vitreous Haze less grade 0.5+ Vitreous Cell Count le ( SUN scale ) , : receive prednisone &lt; 10 mg/day ( equivalent dose another corticosteroid ) and/or least 1 systemic immunosuppressant . 4 . Have posterior , intermediate , panuveitis ; panuveitis , anterior component present , must less posterior component ; 5 . Sufficient inflammation require systemic treatment , base Investigator 's decision , warrant intravitreal subconjunctival treatment ; 6 . Bestcorrected ( ETDRS ) visual acuity 20/40 20/400 ( approximately 70 20 letter ) study eye ; 7 . Best correct ETDRS visual acuity 20/400 good fellow eye ( approximately 20 letter ) . 1 . Patients bilateral uveitis receive systemic immunosuppressive therapy ( e.g. , methotrexate , cyclosporine , cyclophosphamide , chlorambucil , mycophenolate mofetil , tacrolimus , azathioprine ) prednisone corticosteroid treatment uveitis , uveitis fellow eye , opinion investigator , control standard local therapy alone ; 2 . Any significant ocular disease could compromise vision study eye . These include , limited : Diabetic retinopathy : proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy ( NPDR ) compromise vision . Agerelated macular degeneration ; Myopic degeneration active subfoveal choroidal neovascularization . 3 .
