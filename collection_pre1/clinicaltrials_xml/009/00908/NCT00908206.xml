	<brief_summary>This study compare effect GSK598809 placebo alcohol dependent volunteer . A placebo pill drug ( i.e . dummy drug ) make look exactly like real drug . Subjects give one dose GSK598809 one visit placebo visit . These dose visit least 1 week apart . The study randomise , mean computer programme decide chance ( like toss coin ) , order subject receive GSK598809 placebo , word , whether receive GSK598809 placebo first . The study blind , mean subject know whether receive study drug placebo first neither doctor institute . If necessary reason safety , study staff find exactly subject receive . The study last approximately 4 week could 6 week , depend length time screen dose . From screen subject alcohol-abstinent , may put medication treatment withdrawal symptom least 7 day without medication begin study medication . During study subject inpatients Central Institute Mental Health . All subject require fill questionnaire , perform behavioural task undergo MRI functional MRI ( fMRI ) scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomise , placebo control , cross-over , single-blind study effect GSK598809 ( 175 mg , single dose ) multiple pharmacodynamic measure assess fMRI rating scale . In one period subject receive GSK598809 , placebo . Investigator , subject staff site involve study remain blind throughout study . The GSK team unblinded randomisation code . GSK class single blind study however investigator subject blind refer double blind study design . Twenty four recently detoxify currently medication , alcohol-dependent subject specialise addiction ward study group . These subject recruit study participate intramural treatment program , outside protocol . Subjects remain unit duration study . Alcohol-dependent subject enter institute ' treatment program screen 28 15 day prior first dose study medication accord eligibility criterion . Subjects satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion enter study . Along study procedure describe within protocol , subject participate institute standardize inpatient behavioral addiction treatment program outside protocol . Alcohol-dependent participant fulfil diagnostic criterion alcohol dependence detail eligibility criterion . The severity alcoholism assess Alcohol Dependence Scale amount lifetime alcohol intake measure Lifetime Drinking History . After final alcoholic drink prior first dose study medication subject treat detoxification medication ( lorazepam ) withdrawal symptom seven day . Following treatment withdrawal symptom , subject medication free period least seven day ensure detoxification medication wash . Liver function test perform Day -1 dose day must line criterion . Subjects randomise one two sequence : Placebo receive first follow GSK598809 , GKS598809 receive first follow Placebo . Between 8 14 day last dose withdrawal medication , subject first dose study medication first MRI scan . At least 7 day less 10 day first dose/scanning day subject receive second dose second MRI scan . All subject undergo follow battery minimal risk procedure study ; fill questionnaire , perform agree behavioural task , scan procedure include fMRI structural MRI ( baseline ) . Alcohol abstinence confirm random alcohol-breath test . Craving alcohol measure Alcohol Urge Questionnaire ( AUQ ) Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale ( OCDS ) fMRI scan session Alcohol Craving Questionnaire fMRI scan session . Nicotine consumption assess Fagerstrom Test nicotine dependence screen day prior dose day . As described subject undergo two MRI scan session 1h ( 1.5h maximum ) , interval least one week . The scan take place administration study medication ( GSK598809 placebo ) . The single dose GSK598809 placebo administer 1-2 h prior scan . The MRI scanning session start acquisition structural MRI brain image use anatomical reference . The acquisition structural MRI last around 6 minute time subject able get familiar MRI procedure . Fear arousal decline slowly first minute prior fMRI paradigm . Three fMRI paradigm select probe reactivity alcohol-related cue , monetary reward , measure BOLD signal fluctuation brain rest state . Subjects discharge inpatient unit 2 day ( 48 hour ) second fMRI scan ; motivate remain abstinent return previous living situation .</detailed_description>
