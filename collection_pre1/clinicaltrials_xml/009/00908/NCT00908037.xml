	<brief_summary>Phase II , multi-center , 3 part , stagger cohort , open-label double blind , randomize , placebo control study involve 3 age-determined cohort ( Cohort 1 : 12 17 year old ; Cohort 2 : 6 11 year old ; Cohort 3 : 1 5 year old ) . Daily dose eltrombopag begin 5 patient old age cohort open label fashion , review safety , pharmacokinetic platelet count data perform regularly . If safety concern identify 12 week , 18 additional patient randomise placebo eltrombopag ( 2:1 randomisation ) . After 7 week randomize treatment , patient receive eltrombopag open label fashion . The total duration treatment eltrombopag 24 week . If time aforementioned 12 week review first 5 patient safety issue identify , dose begin next low age cohort initial group 5 patient . The procedure follow term safety review subsequent enrolment randomisation additional patient . Initiation young age cohort take place data previous evaluate . Doses adjust accord platelet count tolerability . The study include review safety data Data Safety Monitoring Board .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects 1 year &lt; 18 year age Day 1 . Written inform consent subject 's guardian accompanying inform assent subject ( child 6 year old ) . Confirmed diagnosis chronic ITP , accord American Society Hematology / British Committee Standards Haematology ( ASH/BCSH ) guideline [ George , 1996 ; BCSH , 2003 ] . In addition , peripheral blood smear bone marrow examination support diagnosis ITP evidence cause thrombocytopenia . Subjects refractory relapse least one prior ITP therapy eligible , medical reason , treatment . Day 1 ( within 48 hour prior ) platelet count &lt; 30 Gi/L . Previous therapy ITP immunoglobulin ( IVIg antiD ) must complete least 2 week prior Day 1 clearly ineffective . Subjects treat concomitant ITP medication ( e.g . corticosteroid azathioprine ) must receive dose stable least 4 week prior Day 1 . Previous treatment ITP splenectomy , rituximab cyclophosphamide must complete least 4 week prior Day 1 clearly ineffective . Subjects must prothrombin time ( PT/INR ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) within 80 120 % normal range . Subjects must complete blood count ( CBC ) suggestive another hematological disorder . The following clinical chemistry subject MUST NOT exceed upper limit normal ( ULN ) reference range 20 % : creatinine , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , total bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase . In addition , total albumin must lower limit normal ( LLN ) 10 % . For subject childbearing potential ( menarche ) : subject must sexually active practice acceptable method contraception ( documented chart ) . Female subject ( female partner male subject ) must use one follow highly effective method contraception ( i.e. , Pearl Index &lt; 1.0 % ) two week prior administration study medication , throughout study , 28 day completion premature discontinuation study : Complete abstinence intercourse ; Intrauterine device ( IUD ) ; Two form barrier contraception ( diaphragm plus spermicide , male condom plus spermicide ) ; Systemic contraceptive ( combine progesterone ) . Any clinically relevant abnormality , ITP , identify screen examination medical condition circumstance , opinion investigator make subject unsuitable participation study suggest another primary diagnosis ( e.g . thrombocytopenia secondary another disease ) . Concurrent past malignant disease , include myeloproliferative disorder . Subjects suitable continuation current therapy least 7 additional additional week . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) precede Day 1 . History platelet agglutination abnormality prevents reliable measurement platelet count . Diagnosis secondary immune thrombocytopenia , include laboratory clinical evidence HIV infection , antiphospholipid antibody syndrome , chronic hepatitis B infection , hepatitis C virus infection , evidence active hepatitis time subject screening . Subject Evans syndrome ( autoimmune thrombocytopenia autoimmune hemolysis ) . Subjects know inherited thrombocytopenia ( e.g . MYH9 disorder ) Subjects treat drug affect platelet function ( include limit aspirin , clopidogrel and/or NSAIDs ) anticoagulants &gt; 3 consecutive day within 2 week Day 1 . Subjects previously receive eltrombopag thrombopoietin receptor agonist . For female subject reach menarche status , inability unwillingness provide blood urine specimen pregnancy test . Female subject pregnant lactating .</criteria>
