	<brief_summary>Conjugated Linoleic Acid ( CLA ) obtain human diet consumption food contain ruminant fat . Milk dairy product show high amount CLA . Clarinol ( CLA ) , consider natural supplement regulate Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . CLA known inhibit proliferation human breast cancer cell tumor rodent breast cancer model reduce Spot 14 ( THRSP , S14 ) Fatty Acid Synthase ( FASN ) gene expression breast cancer cell tht two major CLA isomer use nutritional supplement ( C9 , t11 t10 , c12 ) equipotent reduce breast cancer cell growth . This study look hypothesis S14 expression decrease CLA characterize major pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect CLA newly diagnose Breast cancer patient Tumor tissue lipogenic pathway . FASN , S14 Lipoprotein Lipase ( LPL ) , Ki67 apoptotic index expression assess quantitative immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) initial breast cancer biopsy compare resect breast tumor tissue study subject take CLA ten twenty-eight day . Tissue adjacent breast adipocytes also analyze determine whether adipose tissue effect serve surrogate marker tumor tissue . A sample original biopsy compare tumor resection sample determine level CLA breast cancer cell .</brief_summary>
