	<brief_summary>A pilot , multicentre randomize control study surgical leave atrial occlusion ( LAA ) 50 patient atrial fibrillation/flutter undergo cardiac surgery require cardiopulmonary bypass additional risk factor late stroke . Patients enrol randomized undergo LAA exclusion aspirin therapy best medical therapy per guideline . Main research question : 1 . Can successful occlusion LAA safely achieve cut sew stapler technique ? 2 . In patient atrial fibrillation 2 risk factor stroke , removal leave atrial appendage ( LAA ) aspirin therapy reduce risk systemic embolic event major bleed compare warfarin ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The number one cause disability 3rd lead cause death patient atrial fibrillation ( AF ) stroke . Echocardiographic study suggest predominant source stroke AF leave atrial appendage ( LAA ) . At present , sufficiently power trial answer whether removal LAA reduce risk systemic embolic event . LAAOS pilot study recruit 50 participant undergoing open-heart surgery 5 Canadian academic cardiac surgery center . The study inform feasibility conduct large RCT provide information efficacy safety appendage occlusion technique . From study envision large international randomize control trial ( LAAOS II ) determine impact leave atrial appendage occlusion composite outcome stroke non-central nervous system systemic embolic event risk patient atrial fibrillation undergo cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
