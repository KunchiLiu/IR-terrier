	<brief_title>A Study Determine Metabolism Elimination Carbon-14 Labeled Eribulin Acetate ( 14C-Eribulin ) Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct two phase , initial Study phase administer radio-labeled 14C-eribulin collection PK sample , Extension Phase patient continue receive non-radio-labeled eribulin . In initial Study phase , patient receive single 2 mg flat dose 14C-eribulin ( approximately 80 90 microCuries ) administer Cycle 1 Day 1 intravenous ( IV ) bolus injection infusion 2-5 minute . Following initial dose , patient remain research unit Day 8 complete sample collection urine , blood feces PK analysis determination 14C-eribulin concentration Days 1 8 . On Day 8 patient re-assessed discharged , return day 15 physical exam , adverse event evaluation , lab test . The patient enter Extension Phase study continue receive on-radio-labeled eribulin dose 1.4 mg/m^2 Days 1 8 every 21 day cycle .</detailed_description>
