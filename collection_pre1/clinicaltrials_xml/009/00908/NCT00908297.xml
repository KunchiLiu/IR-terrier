	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Coenzyme Q10 Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 400,000 patient receive dialysis United States , expect number go . For hemodialysis , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) account large part health problem patient . Cardiovascular problem come damage heart blood vessel . At present , treatment prove help prevent CVD dialysis . For general population , know many factor increase risk CVD , high level `` bad '' cholesterol . But people dialysis , believe risk factor important development CVD . People dialysis often high blood level waste product . This call `` uremia '' . We believe uremia set chemical reaction blood lead hardening artery ( atherosclerosis ) , important part CVD . Compounds call antioxidant , stop chemical reaction , may help prevent CVD . Coenzyme Q10 naturally occur compound blood tissue . It also readily available dietary supplement often use alternative complementary medicine . It powerful antioxidant . Previous study show blood level coenzyme Q10 decrease hemodialysis patient . Because , important u find give coenzyme Q10 hemodialysis patient help prevent CVD . However , present , study carefully look safety tolerability coenzyme Q10 , whether help stop harmful chemical reaction blood . In addition , many people take medication call `` statin '' help reduce risk cardiovascular disease . We know statin low coenzyme Q10 . It important u know hemodialysis patient take statin low level coenzyme Q10 . It may therapy coenzyme Q10 could increase beneficial effect statin therapy hemodialysis patient . In study , test see different dos dietary supplement coenzyme Q10 safe well tolerated hemodialysis patient . This view later study determine coenzyme Q10 help stop harmful chemical reaction blood hemodialysis patient . This study help u prepare future study coenzyme Q10 , demonstrate safely tolerability compound hemodialysis patient .</detailed_description>
