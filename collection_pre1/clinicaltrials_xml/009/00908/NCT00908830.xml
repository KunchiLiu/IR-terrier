	<brief_summary>Lung transplantation life save procedure patient terminal lung disease cystic fibrosis . Approximately , one 3,500 child United States bear cystic fibrosis year predict survival reach 36.9 year 2006 . Cystic fibrosis third lead indication lung transplantation 2006 . Cystic fibrosis genetic disease affect way body remove salt various organ . It result mucus block duct lung pancreas lead inability handle oxygen malabsorption nutrient . Malabsorption common complication cystic fibrosis affect way anti-rejection medication absorb . One medication utilized transplant prevent rejection mycophenolate mofetil . This medication may absorb adequately population due disease thus place patient increase risk rejection . At investigator ' institution , transplant patient initiated mycophenolate dose regardless underlying disease . The limited available literature regard cystic fibrosis transplant patient mycophenolate suggest patient require high dos due erratic absorption . The purpose study evaluate effect mycophenolate mofetil body lung transplant patient cystic fibrosis effort improve survival outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Lung transplantation establish viable treatment cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patient end-stage lung disease . CF genetic disorder cause mutation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene . These mutation cause abnormal transport sodium chloride affect various organ . In lung , reduction mucociliary clearance lead viscous mucus block airway . In addition obstruction airway , stagnant mucus provide good medium microorganism lead infectious complications.1,2 Approximately one 3,500 child United States bear CF year predict survival reach 36.9 year 2006.3 CF third lead indication ( 16 % ) lung transplantation 2006.4 The success transplantation due advance immunosuppression year . Within past ten year , substantial change immunosuppression regimen include transplant center utilize induction therapy ( 29 % vs. 50 % 1995 2004 , respectively ) ; baseline immunosuppression shift cyclosporine-based 1995 ( 77 % ) tacrolimus-based 2004 ( 70 % ) .5 In addition , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) replace azathioprine purine synthesis antagonist maintenance regimen recent years.4 Gastrointestinal malabsorption common complication CF affect impact immunosuppression . It show CF patient sub-therapeutic calcineurin inhibitors.6,7 However , little information regard MMF pharmacokinetics ( PK ) exist population . One small observational study 30 stable lung-transplant recipient demonstrate CF patient ( n=7 ) require least 30 % high dos achieve similar pre-dose level mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) non-CF patient ( n=6 ) .8 The author include PK parameter result . In second study , 12-hour PK MPA glucuronide metabolites characterized 21 stable lung transplant recipient . The author include 5 CF patient find significant difference PK parameter except ratio MPA glucuronide MPA ( MPAG/MPA ) CF non-CF patient . However , CF patient tend low area curve ( AUC ) non-CF patient . Inter- intra-patient variability MPA AUC determine study.9 In addition , previous study distinguish tacrolimus-based regimen cyclosporine-based regimen . At institution , CF patient manage lung transplant patient regard immunosuppression . Standard start dose MMF 1000mg twice daily within institution , pre-dose MPA level routinely measure since reflect MPA exposure . In contrast , transplant center dose MMF high CF patient base limited report . The purpose study determine PK MPA MPAG CF patient tacrolimus compare cohort non-CF lung transplant patient . Outline study : We conduct open-label , PK study stable CF lung transplant patient . Our study also evaluate non-CF patient control group . Each patient three biweekly PK study visit . On PK study day , patient admit Michigan Clinical Research Unit ( MCRU ) University Michigan Health Center . After administration morning dose MMF , serial blood sample collect following time interval : immediately 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 hour dose . Serum creatinine serum albumin also draw . Vial blood also collect measure function IMPDH . Standardized meal provide PK study day . Serum concentration total MPA MPAG determine validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method.10 Outcome Measures : Pharmacokinetic parameter MPA MPAG determine noncompartmental method . The area plasma concentration-time curve time 0 12 hour ( AUC ) calculate trapezoidal rule . Maximum serum concentration ( Cmax ) time reach Cmax ( Tmax ) determine visual inspection concentration-time profile . Clearance ( CL/F ) calculate dose divide AUC . Samples obtain measure IMPDH correlate PK parameter . These test assay Les Shaw University Pennsylvania . Statistical Analysis Sample Size All PK parameter report mean standard deviation . To analyze inter- intra-patient variability , coefficient variation MPA AUC 's calculate . Differences variable CF non-CF patient determine Student 's t-test Wilcoxon sign rank test . A two-sided p-value le 0.05 consider significant . Our sample size five CF non-CF lung transplant patient .</detailed_description>
