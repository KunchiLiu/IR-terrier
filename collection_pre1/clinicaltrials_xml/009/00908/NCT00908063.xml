	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate safety tolerability single administration Oxycyte patient severe non-penetrating traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . In first dose level ( Cohort 1 ) , 11 patient randomize 2:1 receive either 1.0 mL/kg Oxycyte ( 0.6 g/kg ; n=8 ) NS ( n=3 ) . A total 8 patient receive Oxycyte . The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) review safety data patient Cohort 1 Day 14 , approve escalation next dose . In Cohort 2 , 18 patient randomize 2:1 receive either 2.0 mL/kg Oxycyte ( 1.2 g/kg ; n=12 ) NS ( n=6 ) . The DSMB review safety data patient Cohort 2 Day 14 either approve escalation high dose remain current dose . If remain current dose level ( Cohort 2 ) additional 50 patient randomize 1:1 Oxycyte ( n=25 ) NS ( n=25 ) treat . If escalation occur Cohort 3 , 18 patient would randomize 2:1 Oxycyte ( n=12 ) NS ( n=6 ) receive 3.0 mL/kg dose . The DSMB would review safety data decide whether treat additional 50 patient dose decrease dose back 2.0 mL/kg . This group would randomize 1:1 receive Oxycyte ( n=25 ) NS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , placebo control , double-blind , single dose , dose-escalation study evaluate safety tolerability Oxycyte patient severe non-penetrating Traumatic Brain Injury administer conjunction 50 % 80 % oxygen standard care treatment . At dose level , patient receive Oxycyte compare control group patient receive Normal Saline ( NS ) ; patient receive 50 % oxygen great , per standard care particular patient base / condition , maximum 80 % . Ischemic brain damage find 80 % patient die severe head injury study show early , transient cerebral hypoperfusion unknown origin present 40 % patient . In several early research study , document one-third severe head injure patient reduce brain oxygen tension ( &lt; 25 mm Hg ) especially first 6 12 hour follow severe head injury . In group patient low brain oxygen , clinical prognosis poor death frequent outcome . Based belief increase brain oxygen level would prove beneficial TBI patient , theorize perfluorocarbon-enhanced oxygen delivery may provide great benefit . PFCs especially attractive set several reason ; first , transport oxygen without need erythrocyte hemoglobin thus perfuse oxygenate `` peri-contusional '' brain tissue show capillary narrow impede red blood cell ( RBC ) transport ; secondly , perfluorocarbon ( PFCs ) actually increase oxygen transport oxygen tension tissue , achieve normobaric hyperoxia alone .</detailed_description>
