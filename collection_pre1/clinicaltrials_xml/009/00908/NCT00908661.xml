	<brief_title>Effectiveness Lightweight Mesh Laparoscopic Prevention Parastomal Hernia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parastomal hernia ( PH ) common complication abdominal surgery require permanent ostomy . This type surgery usually associate process fall within scope Coloproctology.PH difficult deal high rate recurrence surgical repair.This type hernia remain problem first order , generate significant consumption health economic resource determine impaired quality life patients.Laparoscopic surgery increasingly use colorectal surgery . Also type approach present problem prevention PH . The use mesh repair hernia discuss since placement prosthesis significantly reduce recurrence rate . There many type prosthetic mesh available . A low weight mesh compose large pore ( 5mm ) high proportion absorbable material layer oxidize regenerate cellulose place vicinity bowel available market ( PROCEED Â® , Ethicon ) . The introduction low-weight mesh provide good opportunity prevent development PH use laparoscopic approach .</detailed_description>
