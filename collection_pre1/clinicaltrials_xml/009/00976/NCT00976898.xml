	<brief_summary>In study investigator study effect proton beam radiation therapy . This accurate kind treatment show affect less normal tissue photon radiation beam . The accuracy allow investigator safely increase amount radiation deliver eliminate cancer . This accuracy potentially reduce side effect participant would normally experience use photon radiation therapy . The purpose study determine radiation use proton beam therapy kill cancer cell participant liver .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants receive treatment outpatient Francis H. Burr Proton Center Massachusetts General Hospital , MD Anderson Proton Therapy Center Roberts Proton Therapy Center University Pennsylvania . - Not everyone participate study receive dose radiation . The dose receive determined location tumor ( ) within liver . - Proton Beam radiation therapy liver give day , 5 day week ( Monday-Friday ) , 2 week . - The following procedure perform week treatment day 1 , 8 15 , well last day radiation : physical examination blood test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Biopsy proven unresectable locally recurrent hepatocellular cancer intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma . Patients single lesion must 12cm less great dimension . For patient two lesion , lesion may great 10cm great dimension . For patient three lesion , lesion may great 6cm great dimension . Patients may single multinodular tumor ( 3 ) . There must evidence extrahepatic tumor . Portal vein involvement thrombosis allow . Participants must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) 20mm great conventional technique 10mm great spiral CT scan . Patients may prior chemotherapy , target biological therapy , surgery , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , radiofrequency ablation , cryosurgery disease long great 4 week first protocol radiation treatment ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) . Patients may prior radiation affected area . 18 year age older Expected survival must great three month ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 2 Normal organ marrow function outline protocol If patient underlying cirrhosis , ChildPugh classification Group A Group B patient include study . Patients must either surgically sterile postmenopausal . Male female patient childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin Women pregnant lactating Patients evidence nonhepatic metastatic disease Local condition systemic illness would reduce local tolerance radiation treatment , serious local injury , active collagen vascular disease , etc . Prior liver direct radiation treatment Patients may serious medical illness , may limit survival less 3 month Patients may serious psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier Patients may receive study agent Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia .</criteria>
