	<brief_title>Omega 3 Action Cardiovascular Risk Factors Patients Treated With Statins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease lead cause death western world . HMG-co A Reductase ( statin ) stand first line treatment cardiovascular disease direct effect LDL pleotrophic effect ( mainly anti-inflammatory ) . Recent evidence show beneficial effect omega-3 fatty acid cardiovascular morbidity mortality Regular Omega-3 fatty acid consumption reduces cardiovascular mortality , , ischemic heart disease stroke mortality . There probably single mechanism action explain beneficial effect ; possible mechanism include reduce susceptibility heart ventricular arrhythmia , antithrombogenic effect , reduce triglyceride level , promotion nitric oxide-induced endothelial relaxation , , retard growth atherosclerotic plaque . Statins proven survival benefit patient hypercholesterolemia prevent primary secondary cardiovascular event . Statins also beneficial effect lipid profile ( mainly LDL less triglyceride ) , reduce plaque growth improve endothelial function . Many study demonstrate additive effect combination statins omega-3 fatty acid lipid profile , well additive effect inflammatory marker ( IL-6 CRP ) . JELIS 3is recent study examine 19000 patient hypercholesterolemia treat statin . This study demonstrate 19 % reduction coronary event statins omega 3 co-treatment . The purpose study investigate several possible mechanism may explain add beneficial effect omega-3 hypercholesterolemic patient already treat satin . Methods 80 patient age 30-70 know dyslipidemia treat statin enrol research center Asaf-Harofeh medical center . All patient pass interview , physical examination , lipid profile , CBC ; glucose level base line . Exclusion criterion : thrombocytopenia , bleed disorder , uncontrolled hypertension , LDL &gt; 160 , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , recent ( 3m ) cardiovascular event , omega-3 pretreatment . During first 3 week patient receive placebo . After randomization 40 patient receive Omega-3 ( 2 pill omega-950 , Solgar , every day ) next 5 month , 40 patient receive placebo . At baseline , 3 week placebo 6 week omega-3 treatment , another 3 month , patient come research center interview , physical examination , lipid profile , include oxidize LDL . In order learn inflammation measure hsCRP , measure Isoprostane marker oxidative stress , Lp-PLA2 measure order learn plaque activity , Augmentation index measure learn arterial stiffness central hypertension , platelet aggregation test new method call cone platelet analyzer measure . In every meeting blood pressure recorder measure 24h blood pressure . Augmentation index : Brachial blood pressure measure use validate , manual oscillometric device .Patients seat rest 5 minute quiet room , time blood pressure measure brachial artery 3 time 5-minute interval . The mean last 2 measurement record representative brachial blood pressure . After last measurement , radial artery pressure waveforms arm sample 10 second Millar tonometer ( SPC-301 , Millar Instruments ) calibrate average blood pressure . Waveforms process dedicate software ( SphygmoCor version 7 , AtCor ) . The integral system software use calculate average radial artery waveform derive corresponding central aortic pressure waveform use previously validate generalize transfer function . Aortic pressure waveform subject analysis SphygmoCor software identify time peak/shoulder first second pressure wave component ( T1 , T2 ) systole . The pressure peak/shoulder first component identify P1 height ( outgoing pressure wave ) , pressure difference point maximal pressure systole ( P augmentation ) identify reflected pressure wave occur systole . Augmentation index ( AIx ) , define ratio augmentation central pulse pressure , express percentage : AIx= ( P/PP ) x100 , P pressure PP pulse pressure . Cone platelet analyser : The CPA test platelet activation whole blood flow condition . 200 µL citrate blood place polystyrene well circulate high shear rate ( 1875 s-1 ) 2 minute rotate Teflon cone . Wells wash water , stain ( May-Grünwald ) , analyze inverted-light microscope connect image analysis system . Results express percentage well surface cover platelet . Isoprostane Isoprostane marker oxidative stress . Isoprostane level measure EIA ( Cayman Chemical Company ) Blood Pressure monitor : Twenty-four-hour ABPM execute Spacelabs 90207 . The monitor mount nondominant arm 8:00 AM 10:00 AM remove 24 hour later . Recordings make every 20 minute 6:00 AM midnight every 30 minute midnight 6:00 AM . Patients classify normal awake BP correspond value &lt; 135-mm Hg systolic BP ( SBP ) &lt; 85-mm Hg diastolic BP ( DBP ) . Normal sleep BP consider &lt; 120/70 mm Hg.20,21 The overall 24-hour normality definition &lt; 125/80 mm Hg.22 The normal dip define separately SBP DBP 10 % reduction BP sleep compare awake period.23 Nondipping define decrease &lt; 10 % 0 % . Dipping beyond 20 % consider `` extreme , '' sleep-related BP `` rise '' denote negative dipping . PLAC The PLAC Test blood test measure level Lp-PLA2 , enzyme highly specific vascular inflammation implicate formation rupture-prone plaque . The PLAC Test blood test clear FDA aid assess risk coronary heart disease ischemic stroke associate atherosclerosis .</detailed_description>
