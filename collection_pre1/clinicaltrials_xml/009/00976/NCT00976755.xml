	<brief_title>Everolimus First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine progression-free survival 12 week patient non-rapidly progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer treat everolimus first-line therapy . - Assess activity safety regimen patient . Secondary - Determine progression-free survival 24 week patient treated regimen . - Determine percentage PSA response baseline 12 week patient treated regimen . - Determine change PSA-doubling time patient treated regimen . - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral everolimus daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow 28 day every 3 month .</detailed_description>
