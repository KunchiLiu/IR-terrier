	<brief_title>A Study Determine Safety Efficacy Albiglutide Administered Combination With Insulin Glargine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , active-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter study evaluate safety efficacy weekly subcutaneously inject dose albiglutide combination insulin glargine compare combination insulin glargine preprandial lispro insulin subject type 2 diabetes . Subjects historical diagnosis type 2 diabetes inadequately control despite use insulin glargine intermediate- long-acting insulin &gt; /= 6 month &lt; 5 year , without oral antidiabetic medication , unable achieve glycosylated hemoglobin value &lt; 7 % recruit study . Subjects must also willing capable pursue intensive regimen basal preprandial insulin .</detailed_description>

Adequate contraception must practice duration participation study include 8 week Posttreatment Followup Period Able willing monitor blood glucose concentration home glucose monitor per protocol recommendation self administration No major illness debility investigator 's opinion prohibits subject actively participate diabetes management complete study Able willing provide write informed consent History cancer , squamous cell basal cell carcinoma skin , full remission least 3 year Screening . History treat diabetic gastroparesis Current ongoing symptomatic biliary disease history pancreatitis History significant gastrointestinal surgery , include gastric bypass banding , antrectomy , Roux en Y bypass , gastric vagotomy , small bowel resection , surgery think significantly affect upper gastrointestinal function Recent clinically significant cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular disease include limited following : Previous history stroke transient ischemic attack within 1 month Screening . Acute coronary syndrome , include follow : Documented MI within 2 month Screening period receive first dose study medication Any cardiac surgery include percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty , coronary stent placement , coronary artery bypass graft surgery within 2 month Screening period receive first dose study medication Unstable angina responsive nitroglycerin within 2 month Screening period receive first dose study medication Unstable cardiac rhythm , however , example , control atrial fibrillation allow Current history heart failure ( New York Heart Association class I IV ) .
