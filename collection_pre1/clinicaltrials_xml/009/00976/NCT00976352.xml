	<brief_summary>Pompe disease inherit condition acid alpha-glucosidase ( GAA ) deficiency result lysosomal accumulation glycogen tissue . Glycogen accumulation lead muscle dysfunction profound muscle weakness . A wide spectrum disease characteristic severe patient cardiorespiratory failure , often fatal first two year life . Researchers develop way introduce normal GAA gene muscle cell expectation GAA protein produce level sufficient reduce glycogen accumulation . This study evaluate safety experimental gene transfer procedure individual GAA deficiency . The study also determine dose may require achieve improvement measure respiratory function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus Acid Alpha-Glucosidase Treat Pompe Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal current study evaluate experimental gene transfer procedure normal copy GAA gene insert cell . In study , modify virus , adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) , engineer carry normal copy GAA gene , know rAAV1-CMV-hGAA , use place normal copy GAA gene diaphragm muscle cell . The purpose study evaluate safety rAAV1-CMV-hGAA delivery individual GAA deficiency ( Pompe Disease ) . Participants currently use enzyme replacement therapy continue receive regular medical regimen 12 month duration study . Participants first attend screen study visit confirm study eligibility . Participants attend 3-5 day inpatient visit , receive series intradiaphragmatic injection consist study agent ( rAAV1-CMV-hGAA ) . Follow-up study visit occur Days 14 , 90 , 180 , 270 365 . Participants yearly follow-up evaluation either telephone mail total 15 year , require FDA regulatory agency .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female subject 218 year age . Have diagnosis Pompe , define protein assay , DNA sequence acid alphaglucosidase gene clinical symptom disease . Using assisted ventilation baseline . Mechanical Ventilation define use ventilation support , ( include limit BiPAP , CPAP ) , minimum 1 hour per day . Willing discontinue aspirin , aspirincontaining product drug may alter platelet function , 7 day prior dose , resume 24 hour dose administer . The subject must : Have require acute , distinguished longterm , maintenance chronic suppressive , oral intravenous antibiotic therapy respiratory infection within 15 day prior baseline screen . Have require oral systemic corticosteroid within last 15 day prior baseline screen . Have platelet count le 75,000/ cu mm . Have INR great 1.3 . Serological evidence hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HIV positive . Be currently within past 30 day participate research protocol involve investigational agent therapy . Have receive gene transfer agent within past 6 month . Have history platelet dysfunction , evidence abnormal platelet function screen history recent use drug may alter platelet function subject unable/unwilling discontinue study agent administration . Have concurrent condition , opinion investigator , would make subject unsuitable study .</criteria>
