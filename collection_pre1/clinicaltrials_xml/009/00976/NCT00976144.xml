	<brief_summary>GW642444 potent selective long-acting beta2 agonist ; GSK573719 long-acting , inhale , muscarinic receptor antagonist ( anticholinergic ) bronchodilator . Both development daily ( QD ) monotherapies treatment Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . Development two inhale drug combination therapy also plan would potential improved efficacy patient benefit work different receptor pathway combine bronchodilatory effect might additive . This study randomise , double blind , placebo-controlled , four-way crossover study ass safety , tolerability , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) pharmacokinetics ( PK ) GSK573719 GW642444 sixteen healthy Japanese subject . Subjects receive four possible treatment single inhaled dos , receive two monotherapies separately , monotherapies concurrently , placebo . Blood sample PK analysis take regular interval dose . Safety assess measurement heart rate , blood pressure , ECG twenty-four hour Holter monitoring , potassium , safety laboratory data review adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator GSK Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Japanese ethnic origin define born Japan four ethnic Japanese grandparent able speak Japanese . Male female 20 65 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . A female subject eligible participate nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] . Male subject must agree use one contraception method list Section 8.1 . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication completion followup visit . Body weight &gt; equal 45 kg BMI within range 1828 kg/m2 inclusive . AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; equal 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Average QTcB QTcF &lt; 450 msec ; QTc &lt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block take triplicate assessment screen . No clinically active relevant abnormality 12lead ECG 24h Holter ECG screen . Normal spirometry ( FEV1 ≥ 80 % predict , FEV1/FVC ≥ 70 % ) . Nonsmokers ( never smoke smoking &gt; 6 month &lt; 10 pack year history ( Pack year = ( cigarette per day smoked/20 ) x number year smoke ) ) A sign date write informed consent obtain subject The subject capable give informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form Available complete study Any clinically important abnormality identify screen medical assessment ( physical examination/medical history ) , clinical laboratory test , ECG ( 12lead ) . A 24hr Holter monitor record outside normal limit . A history breathing problem ( i.e . history asthmatic symptomatology , unless asthma childhood resolve long require maintenance therapy exclusion ) . A mean QTc ( B ) value screen &gt; 450msec , ECG suitable QT measurement ( e.g . LBBB poorly define termination T wave ) . A history elevate rest blood pressure mean blood pressure high 140/90 mmHg screen . A mean heart rate outside range 4090 bpm screen . The subject positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . A minimum list drug screen include amphetamine , barbiturate , cocaine , opiates benzodiazepine . The detection drug legitimate medical use would necessarily exclusion study participation . The detection alcohol would exclusion screen would need negative predose study . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome ) . A positive test HIV antibody . History regular alcohol consumption within 3months study define : average weekly intake great 21 unit average daily intake great 3 unit ( male ) , defined average weekly intake great 14 unit average daily intake great 2 unit ( female ) . Under Australian guideline , one standard unit define 10g ethanol , equivalent 250ml fullstrength beer , 470 ml lightstrength beer , 100 ml wine 30ml spirit . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . Use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol . 17 . Urinary cotinine level indicative smoke history regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining product prior screen . The subject unable use novel dry powder inhaler correctly . The subject know allergy hypersensitivity ipratropium bromide , tiotropium , atropine derivative . Any adverse reaction include immediate delay hypersensitivity β2 agonist sympathomimetic drug . The subject know allergy hypersensitivity milk protein excipients lactose monohydrate MgSt . Subject keep regulatory judicial order institution . Any female childbearing potential .
