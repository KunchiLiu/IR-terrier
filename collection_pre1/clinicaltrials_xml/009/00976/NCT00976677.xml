	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well carboplatin , paclitaxel , bevacizumab work without erlotinib hydrochloride treat non-smokers advance non-small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether give combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab effective without erlotinib hydrochloride treat patient non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) non-smokers advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) randomize standard care ( either carboplatin/paclitaxel without bevacizumab ) , standard care plus erlotinib hydrochloride . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival day randomization . II . To evaluate response rate . III . To evaluate relative toxicity . IV . To determine frequency epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) Kras mutation non-smokers NSCLC correlate mutation status response rate progression free survival . V. To obtain blood tissue specimens marker-based exploratory analysis regard EGFR inhibitor . VI . To evaluate EGFR positivity fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) predictor improve PFS patient treat erlotinib hydrochloride . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord gender eligibility bevacizumab therapy ( ineligible v eligible willing receive bevacizumab v eligible willing receive bevacizumab ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute ( without bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute ) day 1 . Patients also receive placebo orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion 6 course , patient stable respond disease may continue receive placebo ( without bevacizumab ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel carboplatin ( without bevacizumab ) arm I . Patients also receive erlotinib hydrochloride PO QD day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion 6 course , patient stable respond disease may continue receive erlotinib hydrochloride ( without bevacizumab ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood tissue sample collect correlative laboratory study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
