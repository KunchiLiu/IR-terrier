	<brief_title>A 2-Part Trial Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Healthy Subjects Evaluate GSK1614235 , New Glucose Lowering Drug Treat Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part A double-blind , randomize , parallel group , dose-ranging study , subject type 2 diabetes mellitus assess safety , tolerability , estimate pharmacodynamic effect subject receive repeat dos placebo , sitagliptin ( Januvia ) , GSK1614235 . The target explore best dos GSK1614235 provide glucose control minimal adverse effect . There least 4 cohort subject : - Cohort 1 : 8 subject randomize receive placebo , 100mg sitagliptin QD , 1mg GSK1612435 BID - Cohort 2 : 6 subject randomize receive placebo , 100mg sitagliptin QD , 5mg GSK1612435 BID . - Cohort 3 : 6 subject randomize receive placebo , 100mg sitagliptin QD , 20mg GSK1612435 BID . - Cohort 4 : 20-40 subject randomize receive placebo , 100mg sitagliptin QD , GSK1612435 BID , ( potential dose 0.25 40mg BID ) , depend safety , tolerability , glucose result Cohorts 1 , 2 , 3 . - Cohort 5 : 12 subject randomize receive placebo GSK1614235 BID ( potential dos 80mg BID ) , depend safety , tolerability , glucose result Cohorts 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . - Cohort 6 : 24 subject randomize receive GSK1614235 BID ( 20BID ) , sitagliptin ( 100mg QD ) . After subject successfully complete screening procedure , ask discontinue prior anti-diabetic therapy least 72 h admission research facility remain medication completion follow-up visit ( total ~14 day ) . Subjects admit research facility even Day -2 preparation begin baseline assessment , include PD , Day -1 ( particular cohort ) . Beginning Day 1 , subject receive single dose GSK1614235 undergo PK sampling , Day 2 Day 6 , subject dose twice daily dose schedule dos administer immediately breakfast evening meal . Day 6 include intensive assessment PK PD parameter addition routine safety monitoring . Part B double-blind , randomize , single-dose , 3-way crossover study 12 subject . A well-tolerated dose GSK1614235 provide meaningful pharmacodynamic response base data Part A administer fed fast state . It anticipate dose Part B exceed single dos 40mg . Part B consist 3 period . Period 1 begin subject successfully complete screen . They admit research facility even dose ( Day -1 ) dose follow morning overnight ( least 12 hour fast ) . Safety monitor PK PD sample conduct 48 hour period . Subjects discharge research facility 48 hour PK PD sample collect . A washout period â‰¥ 5 day period ensue , subject admit research facility begin Period 2 . Period 3 follow schedule Period 1 Period 2 . Subjects randomize , separate admission , subject receives select GSK1614235 dose match placebo follow . - GSK1614235 meal placebo meal - GSK1614235 30 min meal placebo meal - Placebo - meal 30 min meal</detailed_description>
