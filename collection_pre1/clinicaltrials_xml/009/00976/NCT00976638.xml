	<brief_summary>Colonization patient Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria ( AMRB ) like Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( MRSA ) , Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus ( VRE ) Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamases ( ESBL ) enterobacteriaceae lead infection ; ultimately adverse outcome ( eg prolong hospital stay , death ) . This urgent problem Europe , especially Intensive Care Units ( ICUs ) . In trial , colonization patient AMRB assess baseline period ( 6m ) . In phase 2 effect Hygiene Improvement Program , include Chlorhexidine body washing Hand Hygiene training program , assess ( 6m ) . In phase 3 unit randomize either Active Surveillance Chromagar base test Molecular base test . Study Hypothesis : abovementioned intervention reduce ICU-acquired colonization rate MRSA , VRE ESBL .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A cluster-randomized trial step wedge design conduct adult ICU 's throughout Europe The MOSAR-ICU trial motivate three primary consideration : 1 . Advances behavioral science research ( hand ) hygiene compliance allow well understanding barrier increase compliance ( hand ) hygiene practice within healthcare institution ; 2 . Recent investigation identify new rapid test , chromogenic medium molecular base test , may help identify previously unknown carriage AMRB time admission ; 3 . Currently practiced procedure , regular surveillance patient daily cleanse ICU patient Chlorhexidine , evaluate properly effectiveness . In conclusion , evidence base derive recommendation prospective study regard costeffectiveness different control strategy lack . This study assess impact three intervention ICU acquire colonisation rate AMRB ( MRSA , VRE ESBL ) . Study design : Multi-center , cluster-randomised clinical trial . Study population : Adult patient admit ICU . Intervention : The first phase study 6-month baseline period determine acquisition rate AMRB current standard practice individual participating center ( include currently perform surveillance strategy ) . The second phase consist Hygiene Improvement Program improve standard precaution hand hygiene ; daily wash ICU patient Chlorhexidine gluconate ( HIP ; 6 month ) . In period Contact Precautions ( contact isolation ) implement carrier AMRB , identify upon clinical culture follow current practice individual ward . In third phase study ( 12 month ) unit randomize , intervention phase 2 continued unit . Half unit implement surveillance ( admission twice weekly culture ) admit patient carriage MRSA VRE use chromogenic agar . The half add molecular base rapid test ALL admission culture MRSA VRE addition twice weekly screening patient Chromagar base test MRSA , VRE ESBL . Main study endpoint : ICU-acquired colonization rate MRSA , VRE ESBL . Primary Objective : To evaluate impact enhanced standard barrier precaution rapid screen target isolation patient carry AMRB transmission AMRB . Secondary Objectives : - Evaluate impact intervention ICU-acquired bacteremia rate MRSA , VRE ESBL . - Evaluate impact HIP intervention frequency quality hand hygiene , application standard precaution use contact precaution patient care . - Evaluate effect three strategy patient outcome , include length stay hospital mortality . - Evaluate overall antibiotic use effectiveness empirical treatment ICU-acquired bacteremia . - Evaluate effect three strategy incidence density new acquisition MRSA , VRE ESBL individually .</detailed_description>
