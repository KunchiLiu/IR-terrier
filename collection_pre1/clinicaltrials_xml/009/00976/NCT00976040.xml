	<brief_summary>The goal randomize clinical trial compare early versus standard time initiation antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) respect clearance Cryptococcus neoformans cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) among HIV-infected adult Cryptococcal Meningitis . The investigator hypothesize early ART mediate rapid clearance C. neoformans CSF , manifest great rate decrease C. neoformans colony form unit ( CFUs ) first 28 day initiate antifungal treatment . Secondary hypothesis recovery pathogen specific cellular immunity direct C. neoformans , manifest increase number function C. neoformans-specific peripheral blood mononuclear cell associate 1 ) ART 2 ) pathogen clearance . In addition , patient randomize intervention arm rapid clearance antigen level CSF serum low incidence grade 3 4 Adverse event .</brief_summary>
