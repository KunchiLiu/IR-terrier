	<brief_summary>Acute Respiratory Failure ( ARF ) require mechanical ventilation affect 1.1 million 4.4 million people admit United States Intensive Care Units ( ICU ) every year . Patients ARF average ICU hospital length stay ( LOS ) 8 15 day , respectively , median hospital cost great $ 30,000 United States . Patients ARF experience deconditioning , muscle weakness , joint contracture , dyspnea , depression , reduce health-related quality life , may contribute prolonged hospitalization increase cost . Mechanistically , understood patient ARF demonstrate acute inflammation may contribute cite problem . While investigator ' research others show rehabilitation therapy increase functional outcome lower biomarkers inflammation frail age clinical population , know whether rehabilitation therapy result improve functional capacity functional performance reduce inflammation ARF patient . There previous evidence feasibility safety rehabilitation therapy ARF patient . Therefore , investigator propose two-arm , randomized trial 326 patient ARF compare Standardized Rehabilitation Therapy initiate ICU administer throughout hospitalization versus usual care ( control ) . Standardized Rehabilitation Therapy consist : passive range motion , physical therapy progressive resistance exercise ( strength training ) . The regimen administer 7 days/week Mobility Team consist critical care nurse , physical therapist nursing assistant . The investigator determine whether standardized rehabilitation therapy reduce hospital LOS , improve functional capacity performance , improve quality life , reduce inflammation reduce hospital cost compare usual care . This study 's primary objective determine whether standardized rehabilitation therapy decrease hospital length stay . Hypothesis : Compared usual care , standardize rehabilitation therapy reduce hospital length stay patient Acute Respiratory Failure .</brief_summary>
