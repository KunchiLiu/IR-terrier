	<brief_summary>The principal research question answer study whether exercise base rehabilitative intervention follow critical illness generate improvement exercise capacity quality life beyond current ( usual ) care . The investigator also aim demonstrate intervention practical cost-effective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rehabilitation Following Critical Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advances medicine mean increase number critically ill people , include severe pneumonia ( lung infection ) , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( also know emphysema chronic bronchitis ) `` acute respiratory distress syndrome '' , survive admission hospital intensive care unit . Survivors report health problem breathlessness weakness long discharge . In study monitoring 800 patient discharge intensive care ward , half required form caregiver assistance 1-year . Whilst intensive care , patient usually require help breathe ventilator machine become immobilised . This lead weak breathing muscle three quarter patient , well weak waste arm leg muscle . Survivors struggle regain previous level daily activity function , limited shortness breath , muscle weakness tiredness . It recognise people chronic lung problem , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , face similar problem . In condition , exercise base therapy show improve muscle strength , walk ability , shortness breath , importantly quality life . Given experience , new trial evaluate novel programme exercise-based rehabilitation training patient discharge intensive care . The programme last 8-weeks use exercise design correct breathe limb muscle weakness , well education help patient cope effectively . The programme begin soon possible follow discharge hospital conduct mostly outpatient basis course complete . By speed recovery strength activity , anticipate quality life improve , trial attempt measure . The rehabilitation programme include aerobic cardiovascular , upper low limb strengthen exercise , addition relevant education session .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year AND admit critical care unit Ventilated &gt; 48hours ( via endotracheal tube ) OR receive continuous non invasive ventilation ( NIV ) /noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) Admitted ICU &gt; 48hours evidence SIRS Glasgow Coma Score ( GCS ) 15 ( 15 ) AND Abbreviated MiniMental Test Score ( AMMTS ) &gt; /= 8 ( 10 ) enrolment rehabilitation programme Mobilising ward degree sufficient begin majority propose exercise . Clinical stability observe exercise judge trial team prerequisite . Participant willingness complete programme exercise base therapy aim reduce weakness shortness breath : subjective weakness dyspnoea relative preadmission state implicit Patients refer terminal care prognosis likely less 12months Unstable coronary artery syndrome Limb amputation ( give special requirement orthotics/rehabilitation ) Critical peripheral vascular disease await revascularisation procedure ( claudication distance &lt; 100 metre ) Stroke hemiparesis ( likely need specialise rehabilitation/stay stroke unit ) Severe , disable locomotor problem severe burn , prevent effective participation exercise contain rehabilitation programme . Psychiatric disease necessitate antipsychotic medication , deliberate drug overdose admit ICU indication , ongoing treatment drug alcohol addiction , person fix abode postdischarge Patients undergoing renal haemodialysis ( give associate commitment outpatient attendance ) Extra contractual ICU referral ( distance great suitable twice weekly travel ) Additional exclusion criterion muscle biopsy sample : Coagulopathy e.g . warfarin use</criteria>
