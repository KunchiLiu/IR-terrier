	<brief_title>Intravitreal Ranibizumab Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pigment epithelial detachment ( PED ) secondary age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) exclude practically study population ranibizumab study far . PED represent special entity AMD . As yet , standard treatment establish disease.The stimulus induce PED well know , evidence suggest angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) also play role pathogenesis . Ranibizumab anti-VEGF antibody fragment block VEGF activity patient neovascular AMD .</detailed_description>
