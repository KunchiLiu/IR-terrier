	<brief_summary>This proposal pilot study 20 premenopausal woman high risk breast cancer development receive high dose vitamin D3 , cholecalciferol 20,000 IU ( 2 capsule ) weekly , 1 year . The primary objective study determine feasibility 1-year intervention vitamin D study population . Secondary objective include evaluate biologic effect vitamin D .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Vitamin D Premenopausal Women High Risk Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite significant advance early detection treatment breast cancer , still common cancer among woman U.S. 25 % die disease . Therefore , attention focus primary prevention reduce breast cancer-related morbidity mortality . Due limit number significant modifiable risk factor breast cancer , researcher explore potential chemoprevention arrest reverse cancer development drug intervention . Currently , tamoxifen FDA-approved drug breast cancer risk reduction . However , tamoxifen 's adverse effect limited usage . It anticipate raloxifene use , favorable side effect profile . However , tamoxifen raloxifene prevent estrogen receptor ( ER ) -negative breast tumor , account third breast cancer associate poor prognosis . Current priority breast cancer chemoprevention identify preventive agent may effective ER-negative breast cancer , low risk side-effects . Vitamin D fat-soluble vitamin produce body may come food source . Epidemiologic study suggest vitamin D may influence breast cancer development , result increased interest use vitamin D treatment prevention breast cancer . Numerous experimental study show vitamin D compound anti-carcinogenic property breast cancer . Given epidemiologic data extensive preclinical evidence anti-tumor effect vitamin D , therefore reasonable test biological effect high-dose vitamin D early phase clinical trial . The investigator hypothesize vitamin D3 , cholecalciferol , modulate biomarkers breast cancer risk .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Elevated risk breast cancer define least one following : ( 1 ) Predicted 5year modified Gail model risk 1.7 % great , ( 2 ) Lobular carcinoma situ , ( 3 ) Known BRCA1 BRCA2 deleterious mutation carrier , ( 4 ) Prior history ductal carcinoma situ , current tamoxifen use prior radiation contralateral breast . Age 21 year old . Premenopausal define &lt; 6 month since last menstrual period , prior bilateral oophorectomy , estrogen replacement , serum FSH value consistent institutional normal value premenopausal state . Normal breast exam mammogram ( BIRADS score 1 2 ) . Baseline mammographic density â‰¥25 % assess qualitatively mammographer ( 2550 % = `` scattered fibroglandular density '' ; &gt; 5075 % = `` heterogeneously dense breast '' ; &gt; 75 % = `` extremely dense breast '' ) . Baseline serum 25hydroxyvitamin D &lt; 32 ng/ml . Prior tamoxifen use allow provided treatment discontinue least 28 day prior enrollment . Willingness allow submission core needle breast biopsy pathology review collection blood biomarker analysis banking . At least one breast available image biopsy . Willingness take calcium vitamin D supplement one year intervention , due potential risk hypercalcemia/hypercalciuria high dose vitamin D. Premenopausal woman need take calcium supplementation medical condition exclude study . Dietary restriction calcium intake may impose subject find borderline high serum urine level calcium study intervention list dietary source calcium provide . Normal serum calcium . No history kidney stone . Adequate renal hepatic function : serum creatinine , bilirubin , AST , ALT alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.0 x institutional upper limit normal ( IULN ) . No hypersensitivity reactions vitamin D. Zubrod performance status 0 1 . Not pregnant nursing . Agree use effective contraception , hormonebased oral contraceptive allow switch birth control method discourage onstudy . No significant medical psychiatric condition would preclude study completion . Not meet one inclusion criterion</criteria>
