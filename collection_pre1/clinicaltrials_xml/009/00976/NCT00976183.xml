	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer fifth common cancer woman , account nearly 15,280 death annually United States [ 1 ] . Paclitaxel Carboplatin currently accept standard care first line treatment ovarian cancer [ 2 , 3 ] . In spite standard chemotherapy , nearly 70 % patient succumb disease . Consequently , study continue examine activity new agent dose regimen improve disease free interval overall survival . There recent data suggest weekly chemotherapy regimen may significantly benefit cancer patient ' prognosis [ 4 , 5 ] . Non-small cell lung cancer patient study employ weekly regimen show comparable response survival rate Q3 weekly dosing schedule , favorable toxicity profile [ 6 , 7 ] . Further study suggest weekly Taxane dose least effective , less toxic , convenient traditional regimen [ 4 , 8 , 9 ] . The favorable activity associate weekly chemotherapy primarily study recurrent ovarian cancer patient , investigate efficacy single and/or combination drug regimens [ 10 , 11 ] . However , study involve chemo-naïve patient [ 4 , 12 , 13 ] . De Jongh et al . [ 4 } conduct randomized I/II ovarian cancer trial cisplatin escalate dos weekly 4-weekly paclitaxel . The chemo-naïve patient exhibit 94 % overall response rate 48 month median overall survival , maintain manageable toxicity . In recent advanced ovarian cancer study , Isonishi et al . compare impact paclitaxel carboplatin administer either tri-weekly ( c-TC ) dose dense weekly ( dd-TC ) regard patient progression free survival ( PFS ) [ 14 ] . Median PFS c-TC patient 17.1 month 27.9 month dd-TC group . There also favorable survival rate dose dense patient ( 83.6 % ) comparison tri-weekly group ( 77.7 % ) Shen et al . conduct Chinese study investigate efficacy combination weekly Taxol plus Carboplatin compare Taxol give every three week plus Carboplatin previously untreated ovarian cancer patient [ 12 ] . While two regimen equal efficacy , less toxicity observe weekly regimen . Additional study also indicate low dos short infusion time inherent weekly dosing regimen mitigate bone marrow myelosuppression toxicity associate standard paclitaxel 3-weekly administration [ 13 ] . In addition weekly primary induction chemotherapy regimen , study involve consolidation maintenance therapy employ hope improve survival [ 15 , 16 ] . Micha et al . report significantly good progression free survival result ( 94 week vs. 45 week ) ovarian cancer group receive 12 cycle paclitaxel consolidation therapy follow induction therapy , compare similar group receive 3 cycle paclitaxel consolidation therapy [ 16 ] . The current pilot study design determine toxicity , progression free survival , response rate weekly Taxol ; every four-week Carboplatin ; Vorinostat ( 7 day , 7 day 7 day , 7 day ) give 6 cycle . Some patient continue consolidation therapy , consist Taxol combination Vorinostat additional 12 cycle . Modifying dose schedule establish chemotherapy regimens use weekly chemotherapy administration consolidation therapy may decrease drug toxicity maximize efficacy . These benefit particularly intrigue patient disease treatment long-term . Since triplet regimen demonstrate compelling superiority , combination Taxol , Carboplatin , Vorinostat intrigue potential synergy , distinct mechanism action , non-overlapping toxicity .</detailed_description>
