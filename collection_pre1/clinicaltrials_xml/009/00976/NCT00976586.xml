	<brief_summary>Incontinentia Pigmenti ( IP ) X-linked dominant ectodermal dysplastic disorder . It due loss function NF-Kappa B Essential Modulator ( NEMO , inhibitor Kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer B cell , Kinase Gamma , IKBKG ) , important regulator NF-kB pathway . Major clinical manifestation IP include swirl skin pigmentary change , anomaly organs include eye , dental , bone , nervous system , heart . Affected male mostly die birth . Older patient might immunodeficiency , psychomotor retardation , seizure . Prenatal diagnosis difficult . IKBKG gene 35 kb length , contain 10 exon . A pseudogene ( âˆ†NEMO , IKBKGP ) , locate distal inverse direction true gene , contain exon 3-10 . In patient IP , common mutation exon 4-10 large deletion . But investigator find small mutation derive pseudogene Taiwanese patient . The three aim study role pseudogene IP , frequency recombination IKBKG IKBKGP , possible treatment . To achieve first aim , investigator first develop pseudogene-specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . The investigator first obtain frequency IKBKGP gene mutation normal individual . The investigator detect IKBKGP related mutation IP patient present classical non-classical symptom . The latter group patient , may isolate hair , teeth , retinal , immune problem , likely cause point mutation . The second aim study estimate incidence IKBKG IKBKGP recombination . Because two gene opposite position , recombination DNA loop back likely occur somatic cell . The investigator transform lymphocytes contain IKBKGP mutation , culture continuously . IKBKG mutation check intermittently incidence estimate . The third aim find treatment . The investigator test read-through drug gentamycin PTC2124 nonsense mutation . Either fibroblast Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) - transform lymphoblast test . The investigator hope study increase understand IP , also improve investigator ' knowledge toward genetic disease .</brief_summary>
