	<brief_summary>This study aim determine type traction , weight bag inner thigh taping , foley catheter cervical ripen result great cervical dilation shorter length labor . The primary outcome post-ripening dilation 3 cm time delivery . The secondary outcome patient pain/comfort rating method delivery . The investigator hypothesize use weight bag result 20 % increase post-ripening dilation least 3 cm short average length labor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over last 20 year number induce labor double one five birth 2003 induced . In response rise need cervical ripen American College Obstetricians Gynecologists state mechanical prostaglandin ripen acceptable safe . Prior begin induction , Bishop score ( cervical dilation , effacement , station , consistency , position ) assess . With Bishop score less five , cervical ripening agent commonly use . The mechanical dilation foley catheter work direct stretch low uterine segment cervix local inflammatory response release matrix metalloproteinases prostaglandin . It often choose due low cost , low incidence systemic side effect , low risk hyperstimulation . Compared misoprostol foley oxytocin effective induction primiparous patient , effective improve dilation , safe use misoprostol , associate increase risk uterine rupture vaginal birth cesarean ( VBAC ) . The foley also show short induction time le contractile abnormality prostaglandin E2 gel increase rate uterine rupture VBAC attempt . The use extra-amniotic saline infusion foley catheter use augment mechanical stretching , however decrease induction time improve outcome . Finally , Cochrane Database review find mechanical method cervical ripen equally effective prostaglandin agent . Although safety , efficacy , side effect foley catheter ripening compare multiple method cervical ripening , study compare different protocol foley placement . One study show use oxytocin foley catheter place significantly shorten time delivery . Levy et al show large , 80 ml , balloon result great post-ripening dilation high number delivery 24hours . No study date examine traction place foley catheter affect outcome . Therefore , propose randomize controlled study control current standard care MetroHealth Medical Center place 500cc weight foley place gravity end bed . The comparison method use many institution foley catheter place gentle traction tap inner thigh patient . The primary outcome measure post-ripening dilation 3cm time delivery . The secondary outcome patient pain/comfort rating method delivery .</detailed_description>
