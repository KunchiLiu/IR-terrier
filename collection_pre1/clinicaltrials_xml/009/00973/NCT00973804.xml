	<brief_summary>Background : - Allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) use treat many kind cancer pre-cancerous condition develop blood immune system cell . Umbilical cord blood transplantation ( UCBT ) type allogeneic transplant use none patient sibling match acceptable match identify one bone marrow registry . Prior receive cord blood stem cell , large dos chemotherapy drug and/or radiation traditionally use eliminate cancerous abnormal cell recipient system , along stem cell immune cell . Donor stem cell replace recipient stem cell bone marrow , restore normal blood production immunity . In way , allogeneic SCT provide new blood cell entire new immune system . - In past , allogeneic SCT perform high dos chemotherapy and/or radiation get rid much recipient cancer possible prevent rejection treatment . However , intensive chemotherapy radiation cause serious side effect , include death . A new method use small , less toxic dos chemotherapy and/or radiation allogeneic SCT . In reduced-intensity stem cell transplant , recipient stem cell immunity completely eliminate , weaken enough help prevent donor cell reject . Objectives : - To study safety effectiveness reduced-intensity stem cell transplant give immune-depleting chemotherapy umbilical cord blood provide unrelated donor . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 69 year age diagnose number cancerous pre-cancerous blood condition , include lymphoma leukemia . - Participants must potential donor sibling readily available unrelated donor identify one bone marrow donor registry . Design : - Patients match least two umbilical cord acceptable cell dose . The two frozen umbilical cord blood unit send NIH prior date transplant . - Patients receive one , two , three cycle chemotherapy ( base type disease ) treat disease weaken immune system . Patients already weaken immune system treatment receive round chemotherapy . - Patients receive 4 day reduced-intensity transplant chemotherapy ( also call condition regimen ) prepare transplant . - Two day transplant chemotherapy , patient receive transplant , two umbilical cord infuse one day . Patients receive additional treatment prevent complication . - Patients remain hospital 4 6 week transplant , discharge outpatient treatment study doctor deem appropriate . - Patients continue medication home low risk complication infection , visit NIH clinic regularly first 6 month transplant , less often least 5 year afterward .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Trial Targeted Immune-Depleting Chemotherapy Reduced-Intensity Matched Unrelated Double Cord Blood Transplant Treatment Leukemias , Lymphomas , Pre-Malignant Blood Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The major limitation umbilical cord blood transplantation ( UCBT ) adult graft rejection delay engraftment lead increased infection-related morbidity treatment relate mortality ( TRM ) . To increase engraftment rate time enhance graft-versus-tumor effect , previous study within institution employ strategy target immune depletion ( TID ) . The goal TID use T-cell suppressive chemotherapy prior condition regimen treat patient disease concurrently deplete host T-cells . This lead earlier complete donor chimerism set allogeneic sibling donor match unrelated donor transplantation . Our aim current protocol extend strategy TID reduced-intensity UCBT , goal rapid engraftment , lead decreased TRM increase overall survival . Our intention investigate approach set double cord blood transplant adult pilot manner . Objectives : - The primary objective study see whether target immune depletion shorten time neutrophil recovery improve cord blood engraftment rate measure ANC great equal 500 x 3 least partial donor chimerism ( 10-90 % ) . - Secondary objective include assessment hematopoetic recovery , treatment related morbidity include infection acute chronic GVHD , TRM , progression free overall survival , assessment immune reconstitution , study engraftment kinetics apply prediction two transplant cord engraft relation cell dose , CD34+ dose , HLA-match , experimental variable . Eligibility : - Adults ( 18-69 year ) advance high-risk hematologic malignancy include AML , ALL , MDS , CLL , NHL , HL , CML , multiple myeloma , MPD lack readily available HLA-matched sibling great equal 7/8 HLA-matched unrelated donor . Patients must life expectancy least 3 month , ECOG le equal 2 , relatively normal major organ function . - Patients must two partially HLA-matched UCB unit . Units must HLA-matched HLA-A B ( intermediate resolution molecular typing ) DRB1 ( high resolution molecular typing ) 4-6/6 recipient 4-6/6 . Each unit must contain minimum precryopreserved , nucleate cell dose 1.5 x 10 ( 7 ) per kilogram . Design : - This Pilot study TID set reduced-intensity double cord blood transplant adult . - Patients receive disease-specific induction chemotherapy ( EPOCH-F/R FLAG ) prior transplant disease control immune depletion . - All patient receive identical conditioning regimen consist cyclophosphamide 1200 mg/m ( 2 ) /day IV 4 day fludarabine 30 mg/m ( 2 ) /day 4 day . - A maximum 13 patient transplant initial part pilot study . If stopping rule reach , study expand allow transplantation additional 12 patient ( total 25 patient ) .</detailed_description>
