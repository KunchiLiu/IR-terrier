	<brief_title>Effect Treating Sleep Disorder Breathing Patients With Resistant Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One major cause contributor stroke , myocardial infarction , heart disease , kidney disease high blood pressure . Traditional approach control hypertension ( HTN ) mostly include pharmaceutical target different mechanism contribute HTN . However , adequate control Blood pressure continue remain major problem . Sleep Apnea currently recognize modifiable risk factor resistant HTN . Sleep disorder breathe represent state increase sympathetic drive vagal tone withdrawal , along significant episodic hypoxia . There increase evidence sleep apnea highly prevalent subject hypertension may frequent cause drug-resistant hypertension . We propose compare strategy treat subject Resistant Hypertension SDB detect ambulatory multi somnogram treat subject use : 1 . Ambulatory Autotitrating Positive Airway Pressure ( APAP ) plus Standard medical therapy OR 2 . Traditional Polysomnogram Traditional PSG guide titration Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) plus Standard medical therapy Our hypothesis subject Resistant HTN , SDB , use treatment approach ambulatory multisomnography test treat APAP noninferior traditional polysomnography plus CPAP approach amount reduction mean systolic diastolic 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure , treat 90 day .</detailed_description>
