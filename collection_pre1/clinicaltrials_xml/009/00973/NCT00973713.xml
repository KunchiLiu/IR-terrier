	<brief_summary>This clinical trial investigate effectiveness safety study drug RAD001 patient advance ( metastatic ) cholangiocarcinoma . Palliative chemotherapy provide benefit group patient . However , chemotherapy treatment show low rate radiological response short time tumour progression . Therefore , treatment option urgently require . In laboratory study , RAD001 show interrupt signal cancer cell use grow , spread form new blood vessel ( angiogenesis ) . RAD001 approve treatment kidney cancer . It also approve use Australia treatment patient kidney liver transplant , use thousand patient worldwide indication . Preliminary study suggest RAD001 may activity range cancer . This study evaluate activity RAD001 advance cholangiocarcinoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>27 patient approximately four hospital Australia participate trial , approximately 15 patient enrol Austin Health . All participant receive treatment ( RAD001 10mg/d give orally ) . After screen eligibility , participant receive RAD001 10mg/d tumour progression . Participants undergo regular CT scan ( every 6 week treatment ) evaluate effectiveness treatment . Providing tolerate treatment satisfactorily , may receive study treatment progression disease . Blood sample take screen phase every 3 week treatment phase trial . Participants followed-up every 3 month find survival status , new chemotherapy biological treatment outcome ongoing adverse event .</detailed_description>
