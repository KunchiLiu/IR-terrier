	<brief_title>Do Closed Suction Drains Affect Complications Rate Breast Reconstruction With Silicone Prosthesis ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast reconstruction silicone prosthesis divide two group : immediate late reconstruction . The complication rate report literature around 30 % delay reconstruction 50 % immediate reconstruction . The estimated surgical site infection rate approximately 7 % seroma formation rate approximately 1.2 % . In many procedure close suction drain leave fluid drainage , order reduce seroma formation . Still , time drain ' removal controversial . Our aim study describe relation placement close suction drain , time removal , immediate post operative complication . Patients underwent breast reconstruction silicone prosthesis drain left surgical field would randomly assign two group : control group , drain remove daily discharge 20 cc two consecutive day study group , drain remove post operative day ( POD ) 10 . All patient receive antibiotic prophylaxis regimen . Cultures take fluid discharge POD 4,8,10 12 . The incidence local wound complication infection , seroma , hematoma skin necrosis record analyze .</detailed_description>
