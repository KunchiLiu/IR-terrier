	<brief_title>Erlotinib Concurrent With Radiation Therapy Non-small-cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) still lead cause cancer death world-wide . Radiation therapy ( RT ) one important treatment choice locally advance NSCLC . Combination RT chemotherapy could improve treatment outcome . However , combine modality could use many patient due severe toxicity . EGFR-TKI show great efficacy treatment NSCLC , many phase I/II study establish safety combination RT . This phase II study evaluate efficacy safety combination RT erlotinib treatment locally advance NSCLC . Eligible patient include patient stage IIIA/IIIB NSCLC , suitable refuse receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy . Eligible patient receive oral erlotinib ( 150mg qd ) throughout course thoracic RT ( 60-70 Gy ) . The primary endpoint progression free survival second endpoint overall survival grade III toxicity . We go recruit 50 patient study .</detailed_description>
