	<brief_summary>Each year United States alone , third million person hospitalize traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , approximately 1/4 die . Most less 30 year age . Not health care cost stagger initial care rehabilitation , societal loss term economic impact reach billion dollar annually U.S. alone . Despite advance neurosurgical intervention intensive care management , many survivor fully recover . A significant cause mortality morbidity think due potentially preventable secondary injury , namely oxidant injury , inflammation , apoptosis penumbra ( area brain surround primary lesion , at-risk , potentially salvageable ) , begin first hour severe traumatic event . Despite current bleak outlook many patient , series animal investigation uncover promising solution problem secondary injury see severe TBI similar process , namely early administration estrogen , strong anti-oxidant , anti-inflammatory anti-apoptotic compound . Based encouraging result animal study , investigator hypothesize early administration IV PremarinÂ® patient severe TBI safely reduce secondary brain injury , improve neurological outcome , improve survival .</brief_summary>
