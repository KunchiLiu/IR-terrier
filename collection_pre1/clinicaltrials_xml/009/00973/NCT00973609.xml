	<brief_summary>Investigating efficacy maintenance reinduction treatment treatment watchful wait subject inoperable irresectable non-progressive metastatic colorectal cancer first line induction treatment 24 week fluoropyrimidine- , oxaliplatin- bevacizumab-based chemotherapy . The maintenance treatment capecitabine 5-FU/folinic acid bevacizumab compare maintenance treatment bevacizumab alone maintenance treatment .

	<brief_title>Optimal Maintenance Therapy With Bevacizumab After Induction Metastatic Colorectal Cancer ( CRC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy bevacizumab represent standard care treatment metastatic colorectal cancer . Until , continuation chemotherapy - bevacizumab - represent standard care colorectal cancer treatment . However , since OPTIMOX1 trial show equivalent duration disease control de-escalation / maintenance / reintroduction strategy compare treatment progression strategy oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy , question whether strategy might apply also bevacizumab combination chemotherapy . Furthermore , introduction bevacizumab , new option maintenance treatment evaluate . As continuation chemotherapy plus bevacizumab disease progression regard standard care , question whether de-escalation treatment intensity even withdrawal treatment ( `` drug holiday '' ) certain treatment period inferior respect result time tumor control , allow patient period less toxicity gain quality life .</detailed_description>
