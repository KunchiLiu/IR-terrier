	<brief_summary>Annually United States , approximately 30 million people require treatment traumatic injury emergency department . Two million patient require hospitalization , several hundred thousand ultimately die , often due extreme blood loss . Importantly , traumatic injury lead cause death disability child young adult age 44 , total cost trauma U.S. approach $ 260 billion year . Despite advance pre-hospital care , early resuscitation , surgical intervention intensive care monitoring aim primary traumatic injury , many survivor never recover . A significant cause mortality morbidity think due potentially preventable secondary injury , namely oxidant injury , inflammation , apoptosis begin first hour severe traumatic event . In spite current bleak outlook many patient , series animal investigation uncover promising solution problem secondary injury see hemorrhagic shock similar process , namely early administration estrogen , strong anti-oxidant , anti-inflammatory anti-apoptotic compound . Based encouraging result animal study , investigator hypothesize early administration IV Premarin® patient hemorrhagic shock safely reduce secondary injury , improve survival .</brief_summary>
