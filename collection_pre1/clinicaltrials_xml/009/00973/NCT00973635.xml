	<detailed_description>A handoff define transfer role responsibility one person another physical mental process.1 Handoffs field , like commercial aviation professional athletics , highly visible . In situation , handoff process practice repeatedly near miss review avoid future error . In profession , medicine , handoff occur behind scene lack public visibility result poor recognition problem . Current evidence show handoffs medical provider common , fraught potential harm . On inpatient side , scope preventable medical error become visible public 1999 publication `` To Err Human . '' The Institute Medicine estimate 44,000 98,000 patient die year U.S. hospital result avoidable medical errors.2 Later study estimate communication failure among health care team member root cause estimate 75 % hospital adverse events.3 Hospitalizations complex communication error occur multiple point hospital stay . Miscommunication patient care handoff particular area concern . Due sheer number handoff occur , potential handoff cause harm enormous . At one major U.S. academic medical center , 15 handoff occur per patient typical 5 day hospital stay intern medical service involve 300 handoff 1-month rotation.4 While handoff error occur inpatient certainly problem , may tip error iceberg . Available data would suggest adverse event related poor handoff discharge even large patient safety issue . In one small study , nearly 50 % hospitalized medical patient experience least 1 medical error discharge relate either medication continuity , diagnostic workup , test follow-up issues.5 In large prospective Canadian study , 23 % discharge patient experienced significant adverse event within 5 week , half adverse event judge preventable.6 Many adverse event discharge `` handoff error '' relate discontinuity care breakdown communication patient , hospital physician outpatient primary care provider . A 2007 review article transfer information hospital-based physician primary care physician confirm direct communication rare hospital physician primary care physician , summary often poor quality , availability discharge summary low initial outpatient follow-up visit . The study investigator estimate miss discharge summary negatively affect 25 % patients.7 In spite communication deficit , handoff skill rarely discuss practice . Formal instruction handoff skill lack many US medical school , fact survey clerkship director 2004 find 8 % school curriculum handoffs.1,8 In academic medical center , begin intern ( new pgy1 intern m4 subinterns ) responsible perform majority handoffs4 ( inpatient night float handoff , team-to-team transfer handoff , outpatient discharge handoff , others ) spite evidence suggest intern likely commit handoff errors.9 In lieu formal training , begin intern often learn handoff technique use infamous `` see one , one , teach one '' method . However , optimal format adult learner acquire new skill.10 There perception among many hospital physician patient `` sick discharge quicker '' ever before.11 Without formal education , begin intern may skills required perform complex handoff safely effectively . Currently , curriculum available literature regard teach handoff skill . One single-institution study exist regard teach discharge summary skills.12 This study confirm discharge summary quality improve targeted educational intervention , intervention base recur faculty-delivered lecture would easily implement across multiple site without invest significant faculty development program . Another single-institution study describe development curriculum verbal sign skill , , intervention require noon conference participation able capture one-quarter targeted housestaff due schedule issue patient care conflicts.4 Because faculty training involve , hands-on time need , difficulty schedule educational conference house officer already struggle work-hours restriction ; would difficult deliver face-to-face program large scale ensure trainee receive intervention . The purpose study develop curriculum focus key handoff safety issue . The investigator plan create independent learning tutorial would easily administer begin intern ( medical subinterns 2nd month pgy1 medical intern ) , would accessible across multiple site , would increase learner knowledge regard 25 key handoff safety issue , would improve trainee satisfaction handoff process . The study 's goal make curriculum practical time efficient . The investigator hope educational intervention would also measurable impact quality patient care .</detailed_description>
