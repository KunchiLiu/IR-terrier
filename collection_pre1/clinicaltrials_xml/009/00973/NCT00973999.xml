STUDY SUMMARY TITLE A randomise placebo control trial explore effectiveness Botulinum Toxin injection reduce oral secretion frequency tracheal suction tracheotomised patient . DESIGN Randomised control single blind experimental design AIMS The purpose study determine ultra-sounded guided injection Botulinum Toxin salivary gland ( Parotid sub-mandibular gland ) patient tracheostomy tube in-situ assist reduction oral secretion . OUTCOME MEASURES Amount saliva production / frequency tracheal suction / questionnaire . POPULATION In-patients Wellington Hospital base London invited participate within study . Participants recruit range ward include Intensive Treatment Unit ( ITU ) , acute medical ward rehabilitation ward . All participant tracheostomy in-situ breathing room air , without need mechanical ventilation . Participants receive tracheal suction assist clearance saliva maintain clear airway . A total 40 participant recruit study across two year period . Each participant prior history following : ( ) swallow disorder ; ( b ) stroke ; ( c ) myocardial infarction ; ( ) head neck surgery ; ( e ) respiratory disease ; ( f ) acute progressive neurological disease ; ( g ) structural abnormality could affect swallow ( h ) medical condition require medication could affect swallow . ELIGIBILITY Adults age 18 year TREATMENT Injection Botulinum toxin injection pair salivary gland ( parotid submandibular gland ) , use ultrasound guidance DURATION Data collection two year period / six week participant 1 . INTRODUCTION 1.1 BACKGROUND This Randomised Placebo Controlled trial explore whether Botulinum Toxin injection salivary gland tracheostomised patient effective reduce oral secretion frequency tracheal suctioning . The management excess saliva range conservative , postural change biofeedback aggressive medication , surgical radiological intervention . Studies show use medication , glycopyrrolate scopolamine , effective reduce drooling , many adverse side effect , excessive dry mouth , constipation , urinary retention , decrease sweat skin flush 1-3 . Recent research show long-term efficacy intra-oral surgery management sialorrhea minimally effective two-thirds patient recurrence follow surgery result pharmacological surgical intervention 4 . In contrast study use radiation therapy management sialorrhea , show initial satisfactory response 80 % success rate , although report side effect , include oral candidiasis mild skin reaction amongst participant 5 Many study investigate management sialorrhea ( drool excessive salivation ) Parkinson 's disease patient child cerebral palsy , use Botulinum Toxin inject salivary gland 6-8 . Several study report use efficacy ultra-sound guide injection versus direct 'blind ' injection salivary gland glands 6 9-11 , conclude blind injection effective ultra-sound guide injection , solely inject parotid gland . However , inject parotid submandibular gland use guided injection well safe effective technique treatment sialorrhea 11 12 . However date application Botulinum Toxin patient tracheostomy in-situ require regular tracheal suction due excessive saliva / associate swallow difficulty . This lack knowledge may relevance give airway suction associate clinically significant complication , hypoxia microatelectasis ( alveolar damage ) , laryngospasm tracheal wall damage 13 . Hooper suggest presence tracheostomy tube may cause irritation , result increase production sputum 14 . Patients report sensation pain , pressure , crush , choke gagging , whereas hand skill practitioner , suction may discomfort 15 . Furthermore study investigate knowledge competence perform tracheal suction acute within high dependency ward area conclude many staff member unaware recommend practice number demonstrate potentially unsafe practice 16 . 1.2 RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY If ultra-sound guide Botulinum Toxin injection parotid submandibular salivary gland show effective reducing amount oral saliva subsequently reduce need perform tracheal suction , ultimately make tracheal suctioning unnecessary , reduce time extubation normalise airflow larynx . This turn may normalise swallow physiology , ultimate outcome removal tracheostomy tube . A reduction salivary secretion may also significantly reduce likelihood aspiration pneumonia may positive impact length stay well reduction healthcare cost . Given wide-range clinical competency necessary safe effective administration tracheal suction , pharmacologically induced benefit could attenuate incidence secondary complication well likelihood associated malpractice litigation . The current study also aid produce guideline management saliva patient population . 2 . STUDY OBJECTIVES To determine whether Botulinum Toxin effective reduce oral secretion tracheotomised patient .

PHARMACOVIGILANCE 7.1 DEFINITIONS Adverse Event ( AE ) : Any untoward medical occurrence patient clinical trial subject administer medicinal product necessarily causal relationship treatment . An AE therefore unfavourable unintended sign ( include abnormal laboratory find ) , symptom , disease temporally associate use investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) , whether consider related IMP . Adverse Reaction ( AR ) : All untoward unintended response IMP relate dose administer . All AEs judge either report investigator sponsor reasonable causal relationship medicinal product qualify adverse reaction . The expression reasonable causal relationship mean convey general evidence argument suggest causal relationship . Unexpected Adverse Reaction : AR , nature severity consistent applicable product information ( e.g . investigator 's brochure unapproved investigational product summary product characteristic ( SmPC ) authorise product ) . When outcome adverse reaction consistent applicable product information adverse reaction consider unexpected . Side effect document SmPC occur severe form anticipate also consider unexpected . Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) Serious Adverse Reaction : Any untoward medical occurrence effect dose Results death Is life-threatening - refers event subject risk death time event ; refer event hypothetically might cause death severe Requires hospitalisation , prolongation exist inpatient ' hospitalisation Results persistent significant disability incapacity Is congenital anomaly birth defect Medical judgement exercise decide whether AE/AR serious situation . Important AE/ARs immediately life-threatening result death hospitalisation may jeopardise subject may require intervention prevent one outcomes listed definition , also consider serious . Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction ( SUSAR ) : Any suspected adverse reaction relate IMP unexpected serious . 7.2 CAUSALITY Most adverse event adverse drug reaction occur study , whether serious , expect treatment-related toxicity due drug use study . The assignment causality make investigator responsible care participant use definition table . If doubt causality exist local investigator inform study coordination centre notify Chief Investigators . The pharmaceutical company and/or clinician may ask advise case . In case discrepant view causality investigator others , party discuss case . In event agreement make , MHRA inform point view . Relationship Description Unrelated There evidence causal relationship Unlikely There little evidence suggest causal relationship ( e.g . event occur within reasonable time administration trial medication ) . There another reasonable explanation event ( e.g . participant 's clinical condition , concomitant treatment ) . Possible There evidence suggest causal relationship ( e.g . event occur within reasonable time administration trial medication ) . However , influence factor may contribute event ( e.g . participant 's clinical condition , concomitant treatment ) . Probable There evidence suggest causal relationship influence factor unlikely . Definitely There clear evidence suggest causal relationship possible contributing factor rule . Not assessable There insufficient incomplete evidence make clinical judgement causal relationship . 7.3 REPORTING PROCEDURES All adverse event report .
