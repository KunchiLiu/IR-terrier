	<brief_summary>Fragility fracture common due global aging problem , incur huge healthcare expenditure . The occurrence fragility fracture usually cause fall incidence elderly low bone quality poor balance ability . Therefore , approach improve retard sarcopenia osteoporosis helpful prevent osteoporotic fracture incidence . With intensive research low magnitude high frequency vibration ( LMHFV ) , many scientific evidence support application biophysical modality elderly maintain improve musculoskeletal tissue elderly . Many previous study show osteogenic property vibration treatment positive effect muscular performance blood circulation . The investigator ' previous report also indicate LMHFV could enhance bone quality spine tibia elderly one-year intervention , well balance ability high compliance . In animal study , application LMHFV fracture heal also demonstrate significant acceleration heal induce callus formation maturation , upregulation collagen I , II BMP-2 gene expression detect molecular level . To date , long-term efficacy LMHFV reduce fracture risk fracture rate , however , available , need systematic large-scale study answer important research question . Therefore , hypothesis study LMHFV maintain enhance performance various tissue musculoskeletal system community elderly , thus reduce fracture risk fracture rate . A large-scale prospective randomize clinical trial conduct multiple community investigate long-term effect LMHFV fracture rate reduction fracture risk community elderly , multi-factorial effect , term muscle bone , musculoskeletal system also evaluate . A total 704 elderly 28 community centre recruit within 1.5-year time 18-month LMHFV treatment , assessed fracture risk fix time point fracture rate third year study regard primary outcome analysis . The finding study provide useful scientific data support application LMHFV elderly . The ultimate goal reduce fracture rate quality life community-living elderly .</brief_summary>
