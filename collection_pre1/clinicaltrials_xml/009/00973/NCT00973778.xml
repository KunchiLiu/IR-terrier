	<brief_title>A Study Short Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy Resectable Rectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preoperative chemoradiotherapy become standard part treatment protocols stage II III rectal cancer . Compared postoperative chemoradiotherapy , advantage preoperative application chemotherapeutics irradiation include improved compliance , reduce toxicity , downstaging tumor substantial number patient . The latter may enhance rate curative surgery , permit sphincter preservation patient low-sited tumor , positive impact quality life patient ( Sauer et al , 2004 ) . The widely use chemotherapeutic agent colorectal cancer 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , numerous attempt make improve efficacy , include biomodulation protract infusion . It demonstrate biomodulation leucovorin levamisole effective rectal cancer ( Tepper et al , 2002 ) , protracted infusion 5-FU superior bolus injection ( O'Connell et al , 1994 ) . New oral chemotherapeutic agent include capecitabine introduce tried colorectal cancer . Capecitabine tumor-selective fluoropyrimidine carbamate design achieve high intratumoral 5-FU level lower systemic toxicity intravenous administration 5-FU ( Shimma et al , 2000 ) . It pass intact intestinal mucosa convert 5-FU , preferentially tumor tissue thymidine phosphorylase ( Schuller et al , 2000 ; Ishikawa et al , 1998 ; Miwa et al , 1998 ) . Theoretically , oral capecitabine mimic effect protract infusion 5-FU without complication accompany intravenous delivery ( Liu et al , 1997 ) . Moreover , experimental data use human cancer xenograft demonstrate up-regulation thymidine phosphorylase radiation ( Sawada et al , 1999 ) , constitute synergistic effect . In two randomized Phase III trial , capecitabine show superior overall response rate safety profile compare 5-FU/lecovorinin metastatic colorectal cancer ( Van Cutsem et al , 2001 ; Hoff et al , 2001 ; Twelves , 2002 ) . Intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) -based radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . ( Ballonoff et al , 2008 ) With encourage outcome , investigator initiate prospective study evaluate efficacy toxicity short course preoperative chemoradiotherapy utilize Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) combination capecitabine patient resectable rectal carcinoma .</detailed_description>
