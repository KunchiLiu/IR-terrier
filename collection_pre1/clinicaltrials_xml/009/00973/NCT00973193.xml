	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate activity panitumumab combination standard preoperative radiotherapy locally advanced rectal cancer , follow complete surgery adjuvant chemotherapy . The main hypothesis study association EGFR-targeting agent radiation therapy could effective even improve rate pathological complete tumoral response few toxicity comparison standard care use chemoradiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Panitumumab Radiotherapy Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody radiosensitizing property . In particular , cetuximab combination curative-intent radiotherapy report increase median overall survival radiation therapy alone locally advanced head neck carcinoma . Similar benefit rectal cancer expect . However , preliminary study reveal combination chemoradiation cetuximab seem improve pathological tumor response . However , past study , selection patient ' population optimal since KRAS mutational status consider recruitment . Therefore , new trial investigate EGFR-targeting therapy combination radiotherapy wild-type KRAS patient require . Adjuvant chemotherapy also show decrease risk local relapse patient receive chemotherapy radiotherapy . In study , since chemotherapy give preoperative setting , administration adjuvant chemotherapy postoperatively highly recommend .</detailed_description>
