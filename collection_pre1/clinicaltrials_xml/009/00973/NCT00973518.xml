	<brief_summary>The current study intend enrich extend database Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) healthy control ( HC ) MEG scan include patient meet DSM-IV-TR criterion dementia Alzheimer 's type , age- gender-matched HC subject meet criterion normal neurological function . This study include 2 MEG electroencephalography ( EEG ) scan approximately 80 AD subject 80 HC subject approximately 30 day . All subject MEG/EEG scan baseline 28 - 35 day baseline . Within one day scan visit AD subject undergo 4 standard functional test HC subject undergo 2 standard functional test . This study test follow hypothesis : - MEG scan resting-state , eyes-open brain function reveal pattern correlate activity differ HC subject subject diagnose dementia Alzheimer 's type ; - Patterns correlate activity measure AD subject correspond measure disease severity standard functional test score ; - MEG scan pattern HC subject consistent across repeat measure take 30 day period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study intend extend capability Synchronous Neural InteractionÂ® ( SNI ) test , development sponsor , Orasi Medical , Inc. Magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) FDA-approved , non-invasive technique use measure magnetic field generate small intracellular electrical current neuron . The SNI test evaluate brain function dysfunction analyze brief ( 1 minute ) MEG scan compare individual scan result database MEG scan clinical information . Proprietary software algorithm process data generate MEG instrument allow Orasi use SNI test accurate track diagnosis neurological disorder Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . The current study intend enrich extend database AD healthy control ( HC ) MEG scan include patient meet DSM-IV-TR criterion dementia Alzheimer 's type , age- gender-matched HC subject meet criterion normal neurological function . This study include 2 MEG EEG scan approximately 80 AD subject 80 HC subject approximately 30 day . All subject MEG/EEG scan baseline 28 - 35 day baseline . Within one day scan visit AD subject undergo 4 standard functional test HC subject undergo 2 standard functional test . The result generate study use improve accuracy SNI test diagnose track progression AD . Once robust training set template described , Orasi Medical conduct additional clinical study formally test diagnostic accuracy technology support application regulatory approval market SNI test AD . The objective work produce validate novel track diagnostic technology AD selective sensitive currently available diagnostic tool .</detailed_description>
