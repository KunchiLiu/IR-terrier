	<brief_title>Changing Thought Action Tobacco Dependence With Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tobacco use great cause preventable death US cigarette smoker exhibit substantial relapse follow treatment . Understanding brain mechanism involve tobacco dependence important step toward reduce high rate relapse associate current behavioral pharmacological treatment smoke cessation . This study seek examine effect high frequency , repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) decision-making smoking behavior . A concept central study `` quit '' tobacco necessitate make conscious choice smoke ( delay gratification ) choice influence balance activity frontal-parietal system process value reward limbic system involve immediate gratification . We aim : 1 ) determine two different level cortical excitation ( 10 Hz 20Hz ) , induced different rTMS frequency , influence reward risk-taking choice cigarette consumption . Additionally , aim 2 ) determine limbic activation due acute nicotine withdrawal and/or satiation modifies effect aim 1 . Twenty non-smoking 20 smoking participant receive two level high frequency rTMS comparable sham stimulation ( use electrical scalp stimulation ) deliver left prefrontal cortex . Smokers also crossover nicotine satiation acute withdrawal condition determine rTMS interacts limbic activation associate nicotine use withdrawal . In addition , change preattentional ( brainstem-thalamus processing measure use P50 midlatency auditory evoke potential ) attentional ( thalamocortical processing measure use Psychomotor Vigilance Task ; PVT ) assess treatment quantitatively determine change preattentional/arousal attentional function .</detailed_description>
