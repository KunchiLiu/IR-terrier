	<brief_summary>Background : - Vaccines substance use try create resistance ( immunity ) disease prevent infection . Researchers test new DNA vaccine design new type influenza , often refer swine flu . The DNA vaccine instruct body make particular kind influenza protein immune system able recognize . - Researchers interested determine vaccine safe effective human , would like study immune system 's response vaccine . The vaccine give participant influenza ; however , may effective prevent get influenza later date . Objectives : - To evaluate safety tolerability VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP influenza vaccine administer healthy adult . - To evaluate antibody responses new influenza vaccine . Eligibility : - Healthy adult age 18 70 . Design : - Participants seven plan clinic visit study ( enrollment day study week 1 , 4 , 8 , 9 , 12 , 32 ) . - All participant receive three injection test vaccine , give individual dos day 0 , day 28 , day 56 study . The vaccine give upper arm muscle . - Injections give use needleless system delivers vaccine skin use pressure carbon dioxide inject vaccine skin muscle . Participants remain National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center least 30 minute injection monitor reaction . - Participants ask keep 7-day diary card injection record physical reaction vaccine . - Participants ask return NIH Clinical Center request researcher additional blood test procedure , require study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VRC 308 : An Open-Label Phase I Study Safety Immunogenicity Investigational H1 DNA Influenza Vaccine , VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP , Healthy Adults 18-70 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN- This open-label Phase I study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity 3- injection vaccination regimen investigational plasmid DNA vaccine encode H1 hemagglutinin ( HA ) H1N1 influenza virus . All study participant offer receive additional optional booster immunization license inactivated monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine . The hypothesis DNA vaccine safe human administration elicit antibody response . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP DNA vaccine dosage 4 mg administer 3-injection schedule . The secondary objective evaluate antibody response include induced antibody titer measure hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) assay document reactogenicity inactivate H1N1 influenza vaccine administer subject previously vaccinate VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP DNA vaccine . Exploratory objective related evaluation humoral cellular immune response , include response injection boost license H1N1 inactivate influenza vaccine . PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS- The VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP vaccine develop manufactured VRC , NIAID compose 1 closed-circular DNA plasmid CMV/R promoter encodes H1 hemagglutinin Influenza A/California/04/2009 H1N1 virus , identify late 2008-2009 northern hemisphere ( NH ) influenza season refer swine flu news report . Vaccine vial supply 4 mg/mL 4 mg dosage require 1 mL injection . Vaccinations H1 DNA vaccine administer intramuscularly ( IM ) deltoid muscle use Biojector [ R ] 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System ( Biojector ) . Licensed inactivated monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine obtain NIH Clinical Center ( CC ) pharmacy , use booster injection , administer needle syringe . The brand administer depend upon available NIH CC . SUBJECTS- A total 20 healthy adult 18-70 year age range enrol ; however , 10 subject 51-70 year old age range . STUDY PLAN- All subject receive 3 injection H1 DNA vaccine show schedule . No 5 subject may enrol first week study . Following 5th enrollment , remainder subject may enrol without restriction enrollment rate . All subject contraindication license - inactivate H1N1 influenza vaccine additional blood drawing offer option receive license inactivated H1N1 influenza vaccine . The study include 7 clinic visit 3 telephone contact well 3 additional visit subject opt receive inactivate influenza vaccine . Subjects receive inactivated H1N1 vaccine outside VRC Clinic Study Week 12 may consent contribute additional research sample complete extra visit schedule post boost evaluation . A target window inactivate H1N1 vaccine show schema . However , give subject beyond Study Week 12 , early mutually convenient date H1N1 vaccine supply amend protocol become available acceptable administration optional injection . The added post-boost research sample collection schedule occur relative date H1N1 booster injection . Number Subjects = 20 VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP 4 mg Day 0 ; 4mg Day 28 plus minus 7 ; 4mg Day 56 plus minus 7 , least 21 day injection . Inactivated licensed H1N1 influenza vaccine ( optional ) Day 168 plus minus 28 - 1 dose STUDY DURATION- Each participant complete 32 week clinical follow .</detailed_description>
