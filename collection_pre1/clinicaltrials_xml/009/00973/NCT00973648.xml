	<brief_title>Exploring Voluntary Control Tinnitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Certain patient report able modulate loudness pitch tinnitus temporarily various mean , include attention re-direction somatosensory mechanisms oral facial movement head turn . This subset patient may represent unique opportunity researcher gain insight mechanism responsible tinnitus . Neural activity brain link increase blood flow blood oxygenation . These change concentration oxyhemoglobin versus deoxyhemoglobin alter magnetic resonance signal blood may detect use appropriate MR pulse sequence blood-oxygen-level-dependent ( BOLD ) contrast . In addition increase blood flow due evoke neural activity , brain exhibit continuous low frequency spontaneous activity . These fluctuation tend synchronous functionally relate , spatially distinct , region brain even perform prescribe task . The phrase functional connectivity use implicate neural activity facilitates coordinate activity functionally relate brain region . This study use functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging ( fcMRI ) measure network synchronous brain activity patient tinnitus . Several targeted network link auditory system , attention , control system emotion system link prefrontal cortex . Previously , functional MRI ( fMRI ) use change blood flow blood oxygenation within brain detect isolate region brain active task . The goal functional connectivity research describe pattern interaction picture connectivity occurs within distinct region brain individual involve task .</detailed_description>
