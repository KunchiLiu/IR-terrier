To unpredictable interval due nature virus , one acquire new gene others virus influenza concern bird pork , turn new virus completely new subtype IT ( HE , SHE ) HAS NA , one transmit efficiently person-to-person cause pandemic . This phenomenon one give place appearance new causative virus outbreak influenza humanize Mexico ( A/México/2009 ( H1N1 ) ) , agreement official Mexican number ( figure ) , August 13 brought ( report ) whole 18,861 case 163 death . The measure effective control influenza constitute vaccine , study becomes imperative posse ( rely ) vaccine new virus To ( H1N1 ) East relevant , due level response alert level 6 ( pandemic ) pass World Organization Health ( WHO ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The originality study base fact study clinical test ( essay ) phase IInd new vaccine . Additional allow obtain information relation immunity cross ( among ) pandemic vaccine seasonal vaccine . Equally allow obtain evidence impact possible protection seasonal vaccine use routine program vaccination opposition virus influenza To ( H1N1sw ) . Finally type study ( unique ) design since adult population evaluate Mexico . This study allow : 1 . To evaluate compare experimental vaccine virus pandemic influenza To ( H1N1 ) produce Sanofi seasonal trivalent vaccine influenza . 2 . To determine possibility predict level immunological response level term ( end ) antibody Vaccine pandemic Sanofi produce To ( H1N1 ) . 3 . To determine possibility predict frequency adverse reaction attribute Vaccine pandemic Sanofi To ( H1N1 ) evaluate adult Mexican population . The response evaluate seroconversión ( I increase title four time regard level basal ) , seropositividad ( title ( degree ) overhead 1:40 ) title ( degree ) geometric average . The patient analyze group randomize ( intention treatment ) . The information try use statistical package SPSS , version 10.1 .</detailed_description>
