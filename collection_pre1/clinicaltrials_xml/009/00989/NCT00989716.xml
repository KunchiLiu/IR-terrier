	<brief_summary>Nitric oxide multimodal candidate treatment acute stroke number property may beneficial acute stroke , include lower blood pressure , cause cerebral vasodilation , improve central systemic haemodynamics . Nitric oxide donor effective experimental stroke pilot study patient suggest one , glyceryl trinitrate , deliver easily transdermal preparation . Around half patient admit acute stroke take antihypertensive therapy immediately prior stroke . No data exist whether beneficial safe stop continue treatment acute phase . ENOS prospective , international , multicentre , randomise , parallel-group , blind , control , collaborative , factorial trial design test two question related management blood pressure immediately post-stroke : 1 . The safety efficacy nitric oxide , give transdermal glyceryl trinitrate . 2 . The safety efficacy stop continue prior antihypertensive medication . Previously independent adult patient conscious residual limb weakness eligible enrollment . Central randomisation perform via internet . Treatment initiate within 48 hour stroke onset give daily glyceryl trinitrate patch 7 day . A computed tomography ( CT ) scan require within 7 day randomisation . Early follow-up perform locally 7 day treatment , include blood pressure , early stroke event , adverse event . Telephone central follow-up trial co-ordinating centre perform 3 month . The primary outcome combine death dependency ( modified Rankin Score &gt; 2 ) .</brief_summary>
