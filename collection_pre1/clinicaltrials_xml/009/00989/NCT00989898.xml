	<brief_summary>Children adolescent type 1 diabetes need regular insulin injection continuous insulin delivery insulin pump order keep blood sugar level normal . The investigator know keep blood sugar normal range prevent long term diabetes complication involve eye , kidney heart . However , achieve treatment goal difficult tighter investigator try control blood glucose level , great risk young person develop symptom sign low glucose level ( hypoglycaemia ) . This particular problem night . One solution develop system whereby amount insulin inject closely match blood sugar level continuous basis . In closed loop system , example , continuous glucose sensor communicate computer algorithm drive insulin pump . The investigator develop system Cambridge last year funding Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation . The investigator find system effective prevent hypoglycaemia young people diabetes . Until information sensor enter manually computer pump setting also change manually . The investigator need move onto next step fully automate system . The study do clinical research facility . The investigator study young people two night order find close loop system start early even effective start later sleep . 12 young people recruit diabetes clinic East Anglia region . The study provide important information concern safety , efficacy utility close loop system .</brief_summary>
