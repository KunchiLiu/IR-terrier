	<brief_summary>Background study : Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) autoimmune disease . There four stage disease : 1 . Synovial inflammation 2 . Swelling synovium 3 . Pannus formation 4 . Advanced bone cartilage destruction Currently , cure RA , make disease chronic condition . RA prevalent elderly woman . With medication possible delay onset complication . Over last decade , treatment RA change . Where treatment palliative pain medication ineffective , treatment aggressive early administration disease modify drug ( DMARDs ) . The treatment RA stag . First , patient receives generic , low-cost drug . If treatment become ineffective , treatment adjust different usually advanced drug . Biologics category drug consider advanced expensive . For effective treatment , two unmet need . - A tool aid early diagnosis , allow early treatment delay complication physical restriction patient . - A safe , simple cheap tool monitor disease progress allow traceable , operator-independent informed decision treatment adjustment . Non-invasive optical method offer several advantage exist modality . Optical contrast related physiological parameter body , blood concentration oxygenation . At relevant wavelengths intensity , optical radiation completely harmless . The cost optical method low compare modality . An important application , optical method help diagnosis treatment detection inflammation joint patient suffer rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Due highly scattering nature tissue , non-invasive optical method medical imaging limited extremity human body . For application joint disease , acceptable , image hand provide sufficient clinical information . Objective study : Primary objective : This retrospective , nonrandomized control observational study , conduct single center evaluate potential optical attenuation measurement establish disease activity rheumatoid arthritis patient . Secondary objective : Establish parameter transient optical transmission measurement joint relate clinical evaluation result individual joint Evaluate relation disease activity ( DAS-28 score ) optical attenuation spectra finger patient . Study design : This cross sectional , nonrandomized control observational study , conduct single center evaluate potential optical attenuation measurement establish disease activity rheumatoid arthritis patient . Study population : The subject population patient visit Regionaal Reuma Centrum Eindhoven rheumatoid arthritis . Patient visit center represent cross section RA patient take care outpatient setting . Primary study parameters/outcome study : Primary endpoint successful measurement optical attenuation joint part finger next joint , two consecutive restriction venous blood flow mean pressure cuff . Secondary study parameters/outcome study ( applicable ) : Secondary endpoint unsuccessful measurement relate early termination measurement relate patient discomfort safety equipment software failure .</brief_summary>
