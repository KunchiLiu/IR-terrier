	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass , whether administration proton pump inhibitor , Rabeprazole , negative effect activity concomitantly administer blood thinner drug . Proton pump inhibitor ( PPI 's ) prescribe patient gastric problem reduce gastric acid secretion . The blood thinner drug , Clopidogrel , administer trial approve treatment mild heart attack ; work prevent blood platelet stick together form clot would restrict blood flow . Previous trial show proton pump inhibitor omeprazole interacts blood thin drug clopidogrel reduce active form clopidogrel , thereby prevent drug 's blood thinning effect . In trial , effect two different proton pump inhibitor , namely rabeprazole omeprazole activity blood thinner drug clopidogrel assess compare effect placebo activity blood thinner drug clopidogrel . This do three sequential period patient enrol trial ask participate three different period , clopidogrel either rabeprazol , omeprazol , placebo administer daily .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Rabeprazole Magnitude Antiplatelet Action Clopidogrel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In open-label trial ( investigators patient know , medication administer ) , participant course three different period , receive three different combination study drug , namely either clopidogrel combine rabeprazole , clopidogrel combine omeprazole clopidogrel combine placebo . Each treatment period last 7 day interrupt 2 3 week without medication . The goal recruit total 36 healthy volunteer three period . Clopidogrel blood thinner drug act platelet cell membrane . By mechanism , clopidogrel inhibits platelet aggregation . Clopidogrel prodrug , mean orally administrate inactive drug must activate several biochemical step acquire antiplatelet property . This process take place liver implies complex enzymatic system . A part enzymatic system , call cytochrome 2C19 ( CYP2C19 ) important role metabolism clopidogrel drug . One drug , also metabolized system proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) omeprazole . If omeprazole give concomitantly clopidogrel , metabolism clopidogrel inhibit consequence , therapeutic activity clopidogrel reduce . The aim study investigate whether proton pump inhibitor rabeprazole , whose metabolism much less dependent CYP2C19 , interfere less clopidogrel bioactivation could thus propose alternative PPIs patient take clopidogrel . To confirm rabeprazole clinically relevant effect metabolism clopidogrel , one session perform placebo tablet combination clopidogrel . Each patient receive 2 type study drug 3 separate period ; either one tablet clopidogrel ( 75 mg ) combine rabeprazole , clopidogrel ( 75 mg ) combine omeprazole clopidogrel ( 75 mg ) combine placebo . Each treatment period last 7 day interrupt 2 3 week without medication .</detailed_description>
