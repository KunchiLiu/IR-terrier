	<brief_summary>Jeffrey Chang MD conduct research study learn increase male hormone level , otherwise know androgen , see woman polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) . Women PCOS ovary comprise many cyst , follicle . They also irregular absent menstrual period symptom increase male hormone , facial hair acne . In part study ( except part 4 PCOS woman ) compare response PCOS woman normal control</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms Increased Androgen Production Among Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first part study look specifically structure ovary , female sex gland androgens estrogen ( female hormone ) make . It involve image ovary technology call 3-D Ultrasound . We interested record number , size arrangement follicles ovary . The second part study look ovary produce male hormone , androgen , without follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) stimulation . Hormones substance make gland one part body regulate another part . FSH hormone naturally produce pituitary gland locate brain help ovary produce estrogen , female hormone . LH hormone also naturally produce pituitary gland ability stimulate ovary make androgen . We interest see much androgen ovary produce response LH without FSH . To accomplish , give FSH well hCG , drug act like LH stimulate ovary ; FSH hCG approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) investigational , off-label use . The third part study look much adrenal gland contribute increase male hormone level see PCOS . ACTH hormone naturally produce pituitary gland locate brain stimulates adrenal make hormone . The adrenal gland kidney . They chiefly responsible help body adjust stressful situation work produce cortisol adrenaline . The adrenal gland also produce androgen , male hormone . Previous study show woman PCOS produce male hormone adrenal . We interest see much androgen adrenal gland produce . To accomplish , first give dexamethasone , stress steroid , temporarily suppress adrenal gland . You give ACTH intravenously course 7 hour stimulate adrenal gland . The fourth part study PCOS woman look much role insulin contribute increase male hormone level . Insulin hormone naturally produce pancreas stimulates cell body take glucose , sugar , blood . Previous study show PCOS woman resistant insulin , whose cell take glucose blood response insulin , make male hormone . We interest see much androgen ovary produce response LH temporarily decrease amount insulin blood . To accomplish , give hCG , drug act like LH stimulate ovary , without diazoxide , drug decrease amount insulin bloodstream . These test do diet limit much sugar eat . To test much insulin make , also give Oral Glucose Tolerance Tests diazoxide . This test do drinking sugary liquid test blood 3 hour .</detailed_description>
