	<brief_title>Research Correlation Among Magnetocardiography Patterns Known Cardiovascular Risk Factors Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It well understood diabetes mellitus ( DM ) cause various micro- macrovascular complication . Among , coronary heart disease ( CHDs ) claim mortality , diabetes consider `` CHD equivalent '' . Furthermore , risk CHD notice increase pre-diabetic stage , suggest development CHD may start rather early stage disease . Thus , early detection CHD diabetic patient seem important . However , currently exam method CHD diabetic patient seem limitation . Developed 1960s , magnetocardiography ( MCG ) design detect weak magnetic field generate electrical activity heart , use widely study fetal cardiac electrophysiology , arrhythmia ischemic heart disease . However , MCG pattern diabetic patient fully understood . The aim study clarify correlation among various cardiovascular risk factor MCG pattern diabetic patient . And , accord result study , 'll evaluate potentiality MCG early diagnosis CHD diabetic patient .</detailed_description>
