All subject Subject must fall follow age range : Adolescent subject 12 17 year old inclusive screening visit 18 year dose . Adult healthy subject 18 55 year old inclusive screening visit . Subject BMI weight must fall following : Adolescent subject body weight less 33.4 kg healthy weight use agebased BMI range 5th85th percentile ( see Appendix 4 ) . Adult healthy subject BMI within range 1832 kg/m2 inclusive Healthy determine responsible physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test ECG . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator GSK Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] . For young adolescent migraine subject , nonchildbearing potential also define premenarchal young female yet enter puberty evidence lack breast development palpable glandular breast tissue . Females hormone replacement therapy whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method Section 8.1 wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . ] Childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method list Section 8.1 appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point .
