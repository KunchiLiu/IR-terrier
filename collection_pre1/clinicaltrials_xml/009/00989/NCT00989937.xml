	<brief_title>Oxytocin Add-on Study Stable Anxiety Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anxious patient treat even best currently available anti-anxiety drug continue experience significant symptom . A variety basic science , animal study , human study support idea neuropeptide oxytocin may effective anxiety human . For example , plasma oxytocin level may function index central serotonin ( 5-HT ) function human subject , serotonin well-known involved clinical anxiety disorder . Since oxytocin release directly limbic-hypothalamic cell , response presumably represent direct central assessment 5-HT response limbic-hypothalamus ( Lee 2003 ) . In animal model , Ring 2006 examined effect oxytocin behavioral autonomic parameter anxiety response male mouse use three pharmacologically validated preclinical model anxiety : four-plate test ( FPT ) , elevate zero maze ( EZM ) , stress-induced hyperthermia ( SIH ) . The result study provide specific behavioral autonomic evidence anxiolytic-like effect oxytocin . In primate , Emiliano et al 2007 find support idea SSRIs ' therapeutic effect social affiliation anxiety may mediate part component oxytocin system . Human study include Kosfeld et al ( 2005 ) , demonstrate oxytocin administer intranasally healthy human subject double-blind , placebo control study increase level trust . As well , Kirsch et al ( 2005 ) show intranasal oxytocin reduce activation brain circuit involve fear human subject . Finally , Scantamburlo ( 2007 ) show significant negative correlation oxytocin score symptom depression anxiety . These study clearly suggest potential utility OTR agonism therapeutically relevant mechanism action novel anxiolytic sex . Each subject enrol 6 week treatment period screen phase . Study procedures involve weekly clinic visit outpatient . Forty patient randomly assign either 40 International Units ( IU ) oxytocin twice daily vehicle placebo . After 3 week , treatment cross subject receive oxytocin receive placebo vice versa . The study ratio 1:1 . Dose oxytocin base upon previous study human show improvement psychiatric population relate change behavior brain function ( Kosfeld et al , 2005 ; Kirsch 2005 ; Heinrich M 2003 ) . The total study duration individual subject approximately 7 week , include 21-day screening/wash-out period , baseline ( randomization ) visit , three week treatment period , 1 week washout , baseline , three week cross treatment .</detailed_description>
