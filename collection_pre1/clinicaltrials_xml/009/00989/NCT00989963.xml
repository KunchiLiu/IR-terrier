	<detailed_description>This 12-week , international , multicenter , double-blind , three-group , dose-response study ass safety efficacy BPS-MR patient PAH . Eligible patient previously diagnose PAH stable course ERA and/or PDE-5 inhibitor least 60 day prior Baseline . A total approximately 36 patient randomize 1 3 treatment group ( 12 per group ) 1:1:1 ratio stratify PAH background therapy ( ERA , PDE-5 , ) . The treatment group consist one MTD two FD group . Following randomization , patient begin take active drug ( 60µg ) orally twice daily . Patients visit investigational site Week 6 Week 12 study evaluation . Between visit , clinical site personnel contact patient phone week ass tolerability , provide instruction change dosage , record change concomitant medication , record adverse event . Patients complete study offer opportunity continue take study medication separate open-label continuation protocol . Patients withdraw early study otherwise elect enroll open-label continuation protocol down-titrated BPS-MR discretion Investigator , maximum decrement exceed one tablet ( 60µg ) b.i.d . per day minimum decrement one tablet ( 60µg ) b.i.d . per week . Patients iMTD treatment group dose escalate weekly 60µg b.i.d . reach maximum dose 600µg b.i.d . reach intolerable dose require down-titrate 60µg b.i.d . In instance Investigator 's discretion , attempt dose escalation may make . The FD treatment group consist low dose group receive 60µg b.i.d . high dose group receive 240µg b.i.d . Patients high dose group dose escalate weekly 60µg b.i.d . reach fix dose 240µg b.i.d . Once patient treatment group reach assign maximum dose active drug , weekly increase number placebo tablet administer continue order maintain blind . Patients request maintain daily diary symptom study drug administration evaluation clinical site personnel . Also , patient give option contribute blood pharmacokinetic assessment BPS/BPS-314d plasma concentration Week 12 visit .</detailed_description>
