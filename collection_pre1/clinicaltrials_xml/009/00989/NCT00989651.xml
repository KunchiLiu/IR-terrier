	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose veliparib give together carboplatin , paclitaxel , bevacizumab treat patient newly diagnose stage II-IV ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzyme need cell repair damage survive . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Bevacizumab , type drug call monoclonal antibody , block tumor growth target certain cell prevent growth new blood vessel tumor need grow . Giving veliparib together carboplatin , paclitaxel , bevacizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin , Paclitaxel , Bevacizumab , Veliparib Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage II-IV Ovarian Epithelial , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity ABT-888 ( veliparib ) administer use continuous versus intermittent dose schedule intravenous carboplatin , paclitaxel bevacizumab use two different treatment regimen ; intraperitoneal cisplatin intravenous intraperitoneal paclitaxel bevacizumab woman newly diagnose , previously untreated , epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . II . To determine feasibility treatment regimens four cycle 2-stage group sequential design MTD establish . III . To assess toxicity regimen use Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate response rate ( measurable disease patient ) progression-free survival patient treat treatment regimen . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess extent poly-ADP-ribose polymerase ( PARP ) inhibition peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) day 1 cycle 1 2 . II . To assess genomic breast cancer , early onset ( BRCA ) mutation status patient regimens I II continuous ABT-888 dosing descriptively correlate toxicity efficacy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study veliparib follow feasibility study . Patients sequentially assign 1 3 treatment regimen . REGIMEN I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour , carboplatin IV 30 minute , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute ( begin course 2 ) day 1 . Patients also receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . Patients receive bevacizumab alone day 1 . Treatment bevacizumab repeat every 21 day 16 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . REGIMEN II : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients also receive carboplatin , bevacizumab , veliparib Regimen I . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . Patients receive bevacizumab alone day 1 . Treatment bevacizumab repeat every 21 day 16 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . REGIMEN III : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 intraperitoneally ( IP ) day 8 , cisplatin IP day 1 2 . Patients also receive bevacizumab veliparib Regimen I . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . Patients receive bevacizumab alone day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 16 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
