	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare ability sample uterine muscle tissue contract presence various drug . The drug study typically use contract uterus pregnant patient continue bleed delivery . Amongst uterotonic drug ( use contract uterus ) , namely oxytocin , ergonovine carboprost , effective one use know . The investigator test uterine muscle sample presence drug various concentration , see contractility measure time , compare control sample , drug apply .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) major cause maternal mortality morbidity . In 80 % case PPH , primary cause failure uterus contract delivery baby , require treatment mother uterotonic drug ( drug use contract uterus thus prevent bleed ) . Patients participate study ask donate small sample uterine tissue Cesarean section , test ability contract treatment various uterotonic drug ( oxytocin , ergonovine carboprost ) laboratory . This information help u know effect drug compare contractile capability uterine tissue .</detailed_description>
