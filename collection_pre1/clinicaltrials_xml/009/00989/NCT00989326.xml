	<brief_title>Evaluate Benefits Pacemaker Follow-Up With Home-Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due integrate long-distance telemetry , implantable pacemaker Philos II DR-T capable periodically transmit data pacemaker memory BIOTRONIK Service Center via patient device . The BIOTRONIK Service Center decode data present physician password secure internet site . Additionally , case certain event criterion meet , important Home Monitoring information immediately fax physician Event Report . These event customise physician . Thus , physician able closely monitor patient check adequacy efficiency pacemaker therapy without require patient visit physician . The transmitted data comprise information atrial ventricular rhythm , atrioventricular conduction system status . The purpose national prospective , randomize , multicentric clinical study `` COMPArative follow-up Schedule home monitoring '' ( COMPAS ) describe evaluate benefit pacemaker follow-up home monitoring France . The standard follow-up therapeutic intervention deem base faxed event Reports reception Cardio report analysis internet site . During clinical study , incidence serious adverse event ( hospitalisation , pacemaker dysfunction , cardiovascular event ) , economic impact , safety , practicability analyse . The finding ACTIVE group compare group receive standard care ( CONTROL group ) . Both patient group follow 18 month follow Home Monitoring switch . The data CONTROL group present online attend physician , retrospective analysis difference two group perform . The trial conduct prospective , randomise , open , multicenter , national clinical trial . The enrollment 400 patient 50 clinical centre France anticipate . The principal inclusion criterion indication dual chamber pacemaker/ICD implantation . Main exclusion criterion comprise pacemaker dependency .</detailed_description>
