	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop coordinate , standardized screen program early detection breast cancer high-risk woman . This would include Breast Mammography Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) examination breast . The University Chicago Department Radiology perform research develop good way image breast . The investigator would like able reliably identify abnormal tissue determine whether abnormal area contain cancer without surgical procedure ( i.e. , biopsy involve remove breast tissue needle surgical instrument ) . Annual mammography already recommend patient base family history personal history cancer . In young woman , dense breast sometimes make difficult find abnormal change breast cancer screening ( mammogram ) . MRI , combination mammography , may increase rate detection early cancer . In addition , MRI provide good image breast tissue . The investigator hope prove combine multiple screening measure include biomarkers improves chance , small cancer pre-cancer , find early . This study also evaluate quality life measure breast cancer screen compare breast MRI mammogram high-risk population . The investigator establish database clinical characteristic , blood biomarkers intervention save future analysis aid development effective screen high-risk woman . This research also help u develop tools study future .</brief_summary>
