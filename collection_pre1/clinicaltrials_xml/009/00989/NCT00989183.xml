	<brief_summary>The goal research proposal understand reproductive age process woman improve ability clinically assess model reproductive aging . Reproductive age continuous process begin many year prior menopause . Women late 30 early 40 usually maintain normal menstrual function ovulatory status , yet fertility woman considerably compromise compare young woman . The primary mechanism reproductive age process ovarian primordial follicle ( egg ) depletion , process exhibit considerable variation woman . As result , age individual begin experience infertility menstrual cycle change secondary follicle depletion also vary significantly difficult predict . Multiple study investigate impact lifestyle choice ( tobacco use , oral contraceptive , BMI , alcohol use , parity ) reproductive lifespan correlate impact exposure age spontaneous menopause . Although occasionally agreement , many study report contradictory finding . Alcohol use either delay effect upon age spontaneous menopause . Similarly , oral contraceptive pill use suggest accelerate delay onset menopause . The consistent finding regard impact factor acceleration age menopause 1-2 year smoker . Given lack consistent finding investigation , exact impact lifestyle factor reproductive age currently unknown . Nevertheless , magnitude exposure U.S. population considerable , 19 % adult woman use oral contraceptive 19.2 % current smoker accord recent statistic . This proposal seek develop good model normal female reproductive age anatomical study investigate impact lifestyle choice ovarian primordial follicle number . A secondary aim determine relationship newly describe marker develop assess biological age organ system ( white blood cell telomere length measurement advance glycation end product ( AGEs ) skin autofluorescence ) reproductive age .</brief_summary>
