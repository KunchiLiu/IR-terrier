	<brief_summary>The purpose research study randomize controlled design examine effect prism adaptation treatment two visual-spatial recovery component . After stroke , `` internal GPS '' , locate object people lie particular area space , may impair . Alternately , stroke may impair precise visual-spatial hand body aim movement . The research team wish discover whether prism adaptation treatment ( two week daily 20-min session goal-directed movement prism goggles ) affect visual-spatial aim error selectively stroke . This research represent one first attempt apply know brain neuroscience research , modern clinical rehabilitation practice .</brief_summary>
