	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Diagnostic procedure , technetium Tc 99m demobesin-4 follow single-photon emission computer tomography , CT scan , MRI , may help find prostate cancer learn extent disease . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect technetium Tc 99m demobesin-4 see well work image procedure patient prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Technetium Tc 99m Demobesin-4 Imaging Procedures Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess safety technetium Tc 99m ( ^99mTc ) demobesin-4 ( DB4 ) patient prostate cancer . - To assess biodistribution ^99mTc DB4 patient . - To assess pharmacokinetics ^99mTc DB4 patient . Secondary - To assess performance ^99mTc DB4 detect metastatic spread prostate cancer patient . Tertiary - To compare uptake ^99mTc DB4 level expression gastrin-releasing peptide receptor prostate tumor sample lymph node specimen . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord diagnosis ( cancer confine prostate v locally advance disease v metastatic disease ) . Patients receive technetium Tc 99m ( ^99mTc ) demobesin-4 ( DB4 ) IV bolus 1 minute undergo image single photon emission computer tomography , CT scan , and/or MRI 3 hour infusion . Some patient undergo radical prostatectomy surgical pelvic lymph node biopsy . Blood urine sample collect 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 45 minute baseline 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 hour ^99mTc DB4 IV infusion pharmacokinetic study . Tumor tissue sample obtain radical prostatectomy surgical lymph node biopsy analyze gastrin-releasing peptide receptor IHC . After completion study intervention , patient follow 28 day .
