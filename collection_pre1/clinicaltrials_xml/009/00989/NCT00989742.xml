	<detailed_description>Summary We perform 2 year double blind , placebo control trial doxycycline 40 patient LAM . The main endpoint change FEV1 , measure efficacy , safety dose require suppress MMP activity . After clinical evaluation , lung function , shuttle walk , QoL assessment , blood test , serum urine MMPs ( term full assessment ) plus baseline chest X-ray patient randomise doxycycline 50 mg od placebo . Patients assess 2 week safety screen , every 3 month clinical evaluation spirometry 12 24 month full assessment . At 3 month urine zymography perform see MMPs present urine prescribe dose . Doxycycline increase 100 mg bd three month urine zymography perform . To avoid withhold treatment decline rapidly , patient , two occasion , either fall baseline FEV1 300 ml fall rest SaO2 3 % assessed independent expert ( AET ) . Patients receive placebo give option doxycycline accord protocol . Those receive doxycycline option continue study withdrawal . These patient withdraw due recurrent pneumothorax , increase chylous effusion bleed angiomyolipoma include composite safety endpoint analyse intention treat basis . Power calculation base retrospective cohort ( Johnson Tattersfield 1999 ) show 20 patient per group give 80 % power detect 70 ml/year difference FEV1 base assume SD fall FEV1 75 ml/year . The mean slope regression line FEV1 FVC , plus change DLCO , shuttle walk distance QoL doxycycline placebo group compare parametric non-parametric analysis dependent data , time composite safety endpoint Caplan-Meier analysis , complication adverse event Chi Square test . 1 . Introduction Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) disease lung lymphatics , occur sporadically association tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) . The disease rare , occur 1-2 / million population 40 % woman TSC LAM almost exclusively affect woman , generally develop menopause . The disease characterise progressive pulmonary cystic change , recurrent pneumothorax , chylous pleural collection , case , progressive respiratory failure . Abdominal manifestation cause obstruction dilation axial lymphatics include lymphadenopathy , cystic lymphatic mass ( lymphangioleiomyomas ) , chylous ascites angiomyolipoma ( benign tumour ) . Survival LAM , 70 90 % 10 yr , although highly variable since long-term survivor describe . Diagnosis make combination clinical feature compute tomography scanning , case doubt , lung biopsy . In patient rapidly progressive disease , hormone treatment ( predominantly progesterone ) use , although firm evidence support use . Otherwise , treatment aim complication include pneumothorax , chylous collection extra-pulmonary manifestation . The treatment severe LAM currently lung transplantation ( Johnson 2006 ) . Recently identification abnormality tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) gene sporadic TSC associate LAM identify dysregulation mTOR pathway LAM ( Carsillo , Astrinidis et al . 2000 ; Sato , Seyama et al . 2002 ) lead clinical trial mTOR inhibitor rapamycin LAM TSC . At time write report appear promising . Background preliminary data Cystic lung destruction hallmark pulmonary LAM generally result respiratory failure variable period time ( Johnson 2006 ) . Over-activity protease include elastase , trypsin matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) responsible parenchymal destruction emphysema lung disease . The MMPs family zinc dependent proteolytic enzyme proteolytic activity extra-cellular matrix protein . The MMPs overexpressed inflammatory neoplastic disease addition process extra-cellular matrix also roles metastasis , angiogenesis , growth factor activation inactivation ( Stamenkovic 2003 ) . MMPs -1 , -2 , -9 involve sequential digestion collagen gelatin strongly express wall cyst think contribute parenchymal destruction LAM ( Matsui , Takeda et al . 2000 ) . Further , MMPs detect gelatin zymography urine patient LAM control . Doxycycline tetracycline antibiotic common clinical use . In addition antimicrobial action inhibits synthesis activity several MMPs inhibits proliferation range cell type include arterial smooth muscle , cancer cell cancer model system ( Bendeck , Conte et al . 2002 ; Duivenvoorden , Popovic et al . 2002 ; Onoda , Ono et al . 2004 ) . In preliminary experiment demonstrate primary LAM derive angiomyolipoma cell produce MMP-2 -7 MMP expression proliferation cell inhibit doxycycline . Preliminary clinical data doxycycline LAM In preliminary open label study doxycycline ( 50 - 100 mg qds ) 10 patient LAM , doxycycline improve 6 minute walk distance ) Borg dyspnoea score ( Glassberg et al . Data present LAM Foundation International Research Conference , Cincinnati Ohio 2006 ) . In single case report , Moses et al . observed improvement FEV1 oxygenation exercise patient LAM treat 100mg doxycycline daily ( Moses , Harper et al . 2006 ) . In case MMP-2 -9 initially present patient 's urine undetectable treatment doxycycline . In study 14 patient , doxycycline 100mg bd know give mean plasma concentration 4.41 µg/ml ( range 1.9-9.4 µg/ml ) ( Prall , Longo et al . 2002 ) . Specific issue orphan disease clinical trial rationale trial design Studying orphan disease present specific challenge , specifically limited number patient available , wide geographic distribution low priority funding due perceive poor economic benefit . Patients well inform potential development due patient group internet base information ( Tattersfield Glassberg 2006 ) may obtain potential treatment 'off label ' make definitive research study impossible . As LAM rare , cohort draw wide area require study achieve adequate power . We 15 year experience LAM research UK LAM database estimate approximately 120 patient UK . We currently perform open label study Sirolimus LAM tuberous sclerosis ( TESSTAL , Study The Efficacy Safety Sirolimus ( Rapamycin ) Therapy Renal Angiomyolipomas Patients Tuberous Sclerosis Complex And Sporadic Lymhangioleiomyomatosis ) . This include six patient LAM find well motivate travel long distance study visit ( include Cornwall , Kent Perth ) . Despite known adverse effect rapamycin six eight eligible ( i.e . LAM angiomyolipoma ) patient invite take part study . The current study protocol design simple protocol inclusive patient LAM follow similar routine clinical care hope facilitate recruitment . In addition protocol less demand TESSTAL study . As patient know u via database clinical contact expect recruitment complete within six month . Designing definitive study difficult without estimate likely size effect , large , suggest one case report ( Moses , Harper et al . 2006 ) small number patient need . If small seem likely priori , large number patient need require European collaboration considerably great funding . We therefore design pragmatic pilot study use single geographic population simple , inexpensive protocol serve several function , specifically : ( 1 ) determine optimum dose doxycycline need suppress MMP production . ( 2 ) define safety profile doxycycline LAM . ( 3 ) provide evidence efficacy size effect . ( 4 ) provide data help optimise design logistics future trial . 2 Study aims/objectives Hypothesis Doxycycline prevent matrix metalloproteinase dependent tissue destruction lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) thus preserve lung function , exercise capacity quality life . We perform randomise placebo control trial doxycycline rate decline FEV1 two year match placebo . This study : 1. determine optimum dose doxycycline need suppress MMP production . 2. define safety profile doxycycline LAM . 3. provide evidence efficacy size effect . 4. provide data help optimise design logistics future trial . With data obtain strong position apply European funding European wide trial still require . 3 Investigational plan Patient population recruitment Forty patient either sporadic LAM TSC-LAM recruit UK LAM database , physician referral , LAM Action ( patient group woman LAM ) Tuberous Sclerosis Association . Patients contacted mail principal investigator . Potential participant receive preliminary information sheet response sheet return prepay post . Those express potential interest participating offer face face interview one study doctor assess eligibility , answer question , obtain detail physician involve care obtain write consent prior enrolment . We anticipate recruitment complete within 12 month start study .</detailed_description>
