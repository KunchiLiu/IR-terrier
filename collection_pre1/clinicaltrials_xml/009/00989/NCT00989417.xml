	<brief_summary>In many aspect every-day life , modern communication system bring remarkable increase comfort safety transmit data information easy reliable manner . In order provide advantage also patient implantable cardioverter-defibrillators , well physician , BIOTRONIK develop long-distance implant telemetry enable periodic trend event-triggered transmission implant data intracardiac electrogram distance several meter . The data receive patient device subsequently automatically transfer BIOTRONIK Service Center provide physician password secure internet site . Hence , physician receive diagnostic information without patient visit physician ( Home Monitoring , HM ) . New possibility arise detailed medical event-correlated supervision patient 's therapy use electrically active implant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benefits Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Follow-up Using Remote Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>State-of-the-art implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) provide variety algorithm optimize episode classification minimize danger deliver inadequate therapy . An important role check correctness episode detection , classification treatment play intracardiac electrogram ( IEGM ) , store inside ICD every detected episode . However , analyze store IEGM , physician interrogate implant , i.e . patient visit ICD ambulance follow-up . As result , follow-up perform principally corroborate ICD correctly classify treat detected tachycardia episode , optimize parameter case adverse event detection , modify programmation . The extension BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring® IEGM-Online® LUMOS ICD offer new possibility meet follow challenge : Due integrate long-distance telemetry , implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) LUMOS capable periodically transmit data IEGM-online ICD memory BIOTRONIK Service Center via patient device . The BIOTRONIK Service Center decode data present physician password secure internet site . Additionally , case certain event criterion meet , important Home Monitoring information immediately fax physician Event Report . These event customize physician . Thus , physician able closely monitor patient check adequacy efficiency ICD therapy without require patient visit physician . The transmitted data comprise information atrial ventricular rhythm , atrioventricular conduction system status . The purpose present study evaluate safety economic impact ICD follow-up schedule Home Monitoring France . For assessment , investigation compare two group : For ACTIVE group , first follow-up , patient follow Home Monitoring one follow-up per year . The ICD follow-up therapeutic intervention primarily base triggered event report reception cardio report IEGM-online analysis internet site . The finding group compare group receive standard care ( CONTROL group ) . Both patient group follow 27 month Home Monitoring switch . The data CONTROL group present online attend physician , retrospective analysis difference two group perform . The clinical study analyse , incidence significant serious adverse event ( composite all-cause mortality , cardiac device relate SAE ) , cost reduction , home-monitoring workload , quality life , incremental Costs/Effectiveness ratio , patient willing-to-pay , delay Home Monitoring manage adverse event , sensitivity Home Monitoring detect ICD dysfunction , inappropriate therapy rate impact hospitalization , number ICD charge impact battery longevity . The trial conduct prospective , randomize , open , multicenter , national clinical trial . The enrolment 400 patient 40 clinical centre France anticipate</detailed_description>
