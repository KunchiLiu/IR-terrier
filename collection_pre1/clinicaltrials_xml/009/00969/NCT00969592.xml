	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare pharmacodynamics ( course blood glucose-lowering effect duration effect ) pharmacokinetics ( course concentration study medication blood ) single subcutaneous dose 0.2 units/kg insulin glulisine insulin aspart direct head-to-head comparison two euglycemic glucose clamp healthy subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expanded PK PD Insulin Glulisine Versus Insulin Aspart Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In previous glucose clamp study head-to-head comparison insulin glulisine insulin lispro show onset metabolic action significantly short insulin glulisine insulin lispro ( total metabolic effect different ) . These result line faster early insulin exposure insulin glulisine compare insulin lispro . The primary aim study investigate whether favorable characteristic insulin glulisine also evident comparison insulin aspart . This first clinical study realize head-to-head comparison two insulin analog .</detailed_description>
