	<brief_title>Multisite Controlled Trial Cocaine Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 18-week , placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial among 300 cocaine dependent patient design test efficacy newly develop active vaccine cocaine ( TA-CD ) . TA-CD vaccine consist succinylnorcocaine ( SNC ) couple recombinant cholera toxin B subunit ( rCTB ) design raise anti-cocaine antibody circulation bind cocaine enter bloodstream , follow administration intravenous intranasal route smoke . The antigen-antibody complex large cross blood-brain barrier , prevent high concentration cocaine reach brain 's nucleus accumbens thereby block pleasurable response cocaine reduce rate drug use . The effectiveness vaccine dependent induce sufficient level anti-cocaine antibody match challenge subsequent dose cocaine . Because TA-CD take several week generate antibody response , plan use contingency management interval sustain treatment engagement . Furthermore , since TA-CD may prove effective patient antibody prevent cocaine slip turn binge ( return regular use ) attenuate prim effect , complement vaccine use cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) teach patient cope prim effect prevent full relapse .</detailed_description>
