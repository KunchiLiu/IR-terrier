	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether men woman respond differently see item related cocaine use remember stressful event . Four group individual recruit participate study : men cocaine dependence , woman cocaine dependence , men without cocaine dependence , woman without cocaine dependence . Hypothesis # 1 : Cocaine-dependent woman demonstrate small increase neuroendocrine , great increase heart rate cocaine crave subjective distress expose stress compare cocaine-dependent men non cocaine-dependent men woman . Hypothesis # 2 : Cocaine-dependent men demonstrate great increase neuroendocrine , great increase heart rate cocaine crave subjective distress expose cocaine-related cue compare cocaine-dependent woman non cocaine-dependent men woman . Hypothesis # 3 : Cocaine-dependent woman demonstrate great increase heart rate cocaine crave subjective distress expose stress induce stimulus compare response cocaine-related cue . Hypothesis # 4 : The neuroendocrine response stress hormone ( corticotropin release hormone ; CRH ) great cocaine-dependent woman compare cocaine-dependent men .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must able provide inform consent function intellectual level sufficient allow accurate completion assessment instrument . Subjects must consent remain abstinent drug abuse ( except nicotine ) twoday period immediately prior GCRC admission . In case lab result , subject selfreport , staff observation suggest patient use alcohol drug within two day hospital admission , patient admit discretion oncall study staff . Nicotine dependence affect HPA function ( Baron et al. , 1995 ) therefore would ideal exclude subject nicotine use four group . Because high comorbidity alcohol use cocaine dependence , individual alcohol abuse dependence include . Approximately equal number nicotinedependent individual recruit study group . Alcohol use two day prior test discourage , nicotine use immediately prior test session control . Subjects must consent random assignment . Subjects must consent outpatient admission GCRC two overnight admission Medical University Hospital . Subjects must consent oneweek onemonth followup visit GCRC admission . Women pregnant , nurse childbearing potential practicing effective mean birth control . Because oral contraceptive may affect HPA axis function , number woman various type oral contraceptive ( triphasic v static ) woman depot progesterone balance group Women premenstrual dysphoric disorder may impact response stress test procedure ( Woods et al. , 1994 ) . Subjects evidence history significant hematological , endocrine , cardiovascular , pulmonary , renal , gastrointestinal , neurological disease include diabetes , condition may affect HPA axis function . Subjects liver function test ( LFTs ) great two time normal , compromise liver function interfere HPA axis activity ( Williams &amp; Dluhy , 1987 ) . Subjects Addison 's disease , Cushing 's disease diseases adrenal cortex likely affect HPA axis function . Subjects history current psychotic disorder bipolar affective disorder may interfere HPA function . Subjects current major depressive disorder posttraumatic stress disorder disorder associate characteristic change HPA axis function . Subjects receive synthetic glucocorticoid therapy , exogenous steroid therapy , treatment agent interfere HPA axis function within one month time test . Subjects take opiate , opiate antagonist , benzodiazepine . ( Subjects maintain SSRI 's , anticonvulsant , antipsychotic ( sleep ) 8 week longer NOT exclude ) . Subjects acute illness fever may affect HPA axis activity . Individuals otherwise meet study criterion reschedule evaluation participation . Subjects 30 % ideal weight BMI great 30 consider study participation base clinical judgment study staff . Subjects unwilling maintain abstinence alcohol drug abuse ( except nicotine ) two day prior stress task procedure . Women give birth child within past 6 month initial screening .</criteria>
