	<brief_summary>To determine mu opioid receptor gene ( OPRM1 ) A118G polymorphism moderate subjective-rewarding effect intravenous ( IV ) nicotine male female smoker . The subjective effect nicotine measure Drug Effects Questionnaire , include rating `` good effect '' `` drug liking '' . We hypothesize smoker AG/GG genotype OPRM1 A118G attenuate subjective-rewarding effect IV nicotine compare AA genotype .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensitivity Intravenous Nicotine : Genetic Moderators</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing evidence suggest MOR contribute nicotine 's rewarding effect . Further , functional OPRM1 A118G variant link rewarding effect alcohol alcohol user nicotine female smoker . Since previous study examine influence A118G variation pure nicotine response , next logical step evaluate genetic polymorphism affect nicotine 's rewarding , cognitive , physiological effect use IV nicotine administration male female smoker . In addition , association G398A polymorphism CHRNA5 gene ( rs16969968 ) maximal response nicotinic agonist justifies examination SNP moderator IV nicotine sensitivity human ( Bierut et al . 2008 ) . This SNP examine exploratory fashion since feasible fully stratify study sample multiple SNPs . The frequency rs16969968 SNP range 35 % -42 % among European ancestry , make feasible examine variation subject sample . Currently study active enrollment continue . Currently 205 completers go .
