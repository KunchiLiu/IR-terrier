	<detailed_description>Infants dependent parenteral nutrition great 1 year develop Parenteral Nutrition Associated Cholestasis universally face mortality unless receive timely liver and/or small bowel transplant . Although transplant survival improve recent year , survival guaranteed , transplant care remain costly . Alternative nutritional pharmacological strategy imperative improve clinical outcome infant intestinal failure parenteral nutrition associate cholestasis . In animal human study , intravenous fish oil , lipid emulsion rich omega-3 fatty acid lack phytosterols , show ameliorate parenteral nutrition associate cholestasis improve morbidity mortality . The purpose pilot study investigate Omegaven , commercially available intravenous fish oil , 1 g/kg/d , safely reverse liver disease 80 subject parenteral nutrition associate cholestasis . Subjects initially receive maximum 6 month ( 24 week ) intravenous fish oil . If subject re-develops liver disease still satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion , intervention restart two time additional 6 month ( 24 week ) time . Study subject compare historical cohort child Short Bowel Syndrome parenteral nutrition associate cholestasis receive standard intravenous soybean oil &gt; 60 day . The fish oil cohort follow total 5 year determine transplant-free mortality reduce .</detailed_description>
