	<brief_summary>This study double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study . After enrolment initial assessment , subject receive oral GW856553 7.5 milligram ( mg ) twice daily ( BID ) match placebo 28 day 1:1 ratio . Sufficient number subject recruit obtain 142 evaluable subject . This double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel group study . Subjects undertake screening period may last approximately 3 week , follow baseline period 1 week , randomize treatment period 4 week follow-up period approximately 2 week . This multi-centre , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study subject least moderate intensity neuropathic pain result peripheral nerve injury due trauma surgery . It investigate efficacy , safety tolerability GW856553 28 day treatment . Approximately 158 subject randomize ensure 142 evaluable subject . Randomization ratio 1:1 placebo GW856553 respectively . The dose GW856553 7.5 mg BID .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female subject age 18 80 year inclusive , time signing informed consent . Female nonchild bear potential child bear potential agrees use appropriate contraception method . A diagnosis peripheral neuropathic pain Focal neuropathic pain relate nerve injury cause trauma surgery associate acute medical condition injury avulsion ( example include limited neuropathic pain secondary surgical procedure thoracotomy , mastectomy , inguinal herniorrhaphy radical neck dissection , traumatic mononeuropathy brachial plexus lumbosacral injury due bullet wound , laceration , road traffic accident etc ) . Location pain consistent area innervate affected nerve ( ) , without sensory symptom affect area . Duration pain least 12 week since initial insult . Subjects medication neuropathic pain ( include tricyclic antidepressant , anticonvulsant , opioids , tramadol , bupropion , venlafaxine , mexiletine , muscle relaxant , NmethylDaspartate ( NMDA ) antagonists ) exclude exclude nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , cycloxygenase2 inhibitor ( COX2 ) , topical lidocaine , topical capsaicin , nerve block steroid injection may include study stable dos medication least 4 week prior baseline period ( Day 7 ) . Participants NSAIDs , COX2 inhibitor topical lidocaine may include study stop medication least 5 halflives prior baseline period ( Day 7 ) . In case topical capsaicin , subject stop least 8 week prior baseline period . Participants receive nerve block steroid injection neuropathic pain may include recent treatment least 4 week prior baseline period ( Day 7 ) . Subjects ' baseline average daily pain score PINRS , calculated average daily PINRS score 7 day prior Day 1 , great equal 4 PINRS , washout prohibit medication . Subjects need record daily PINRS minimum 4 day 7 day prior Day 1 . Subjects tell prior completion baseline period entry requirement average PINRS least 4 , order bias pain intensity score baseline period . Male subject must agree use appropriate contraception method . Body weight &gt; =50 kg men &gt; =45 kg woman . Participants provide full write informed consent prior performance protocolspecified procedure , include compliance requirement restriction . Single QT duration correct heart rate Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) QT duration correct heart rate Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) &lt; 450 msec ; QTc &lt; 480 millisecond ( msec ) subject Bundle Branch Block . If first QTc exceed limit , repeat ECG twice least 5 min apart take mean three QTc value determine mean QTc satisfy limit . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator GSK Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Subjects cause neuropathic pain [ e.g . trigeminal neuralgia , painful diabetic neuropathy , mononeuritis multiplex , central poststroke pain , fail back surgery , phantom limb pain , peripheral neuropathy due alcoholism , malignancy , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , syphilis , drug abuse , cobalamin ( vitamin B12 ) deficiency , hypothyroidism , liver disease , toxic exposure ] , substantial somatic pain component one cause potential cause pain symptom nerve entrapment chronic neck back pain mild degree concurrent rheumatic disease limit fibromyalgia rheumatoid arthritis . Subjects intractable pain unknown origin active infection/inflammation area nerve injury . Subjects extensive soft tissue injury associate extensive surgery treatment nerve injury . Any question regard definition extensive surgery discuss GSK medical monitor . A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . However , positive drug screen automatically exclude subject medical explanation positive result drug abuse e.g . subject take opioids neuropathic pain . A positive test HIV antibody . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen History liver disease within last 6 month . History excessive regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study . History presence significant cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , renal disease condition know interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion drug , opinion Investigator may interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . History presence clinically significant abnormality vital sign / ECG / laboratory test , medical psychiatric condition , , opinion Investigator , may interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . Subject clinical evidence recent major depression ( medical history ) except subject already control antidepressant screen . Subjects , clinical judgement investigator , may malinger motivated secondary gain participation study , exclude . Examples consideration exclusion include subject compensation social security claim pending relation peripheral nerve injury appeal refusal claim , subject whose claim settle need exclude . Changes medication permit treatment neuropathic pain within 4 week baseline period ( Day 7 ) , include dose adjustment , withdrawal medication initiation new medication . Subjects unable maintain medication treatment neuropathic pain stable dose baseline study . Unable refrain excessive use sedative medication ( e.g . benzodiazepine prescribed hypnotic ) opinion Investigator may interfere efficacy safety assessment . Use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication study , unless opinion Investigator Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety introduce risk drugdrug interaction . Unable stop remain abstain nonpharmacological treatment neuropathic pain study . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior baseline period ( Day 7 ) current study : 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . History hypersensitivity GW856553 component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 milliliter ( mL ) within 56 day period . Pregnant female determine positive urine serum human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) test screen prior dosing . Lactating female . Unwillingness inability follow study procedure Subject mentally legally incapacitate . Subjects condition require immunosuppressive therapy , otherwise consider immunosuppressed .</criteria>
