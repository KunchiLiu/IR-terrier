	<detailed_description>Migraine prevalent 10-12 % population , female preponderance ( 1 ) . Migraine may cause significant distress reduction quality life patient , almost third migraine attack reduces ability function . The main form migraine migraine without aura 20-30 % patient migraine aura ( 2 ) focal neurological phenomenon occur 20-30 minute prior migraine pain . The development cranial perivascular neurogenic inflammation hallmark migraine attack involve secretion vasodilatatory inflammatory peptide perivascular intracranial trigeminal terminal ( 3 ) . Recent information suggest migraine might risk factor stroke . Migraineurs find carry high risk develop stroke compare subject without migraine , risk high among patient migraine aura ( 4-6 ) particular woman 45 year age young ( 7-8 ) . Brain MRI study show migraineurs sub-clinical infarct abnormal white matter signal , particular among young woman migraine aura compare normal control ( 9-10 ) . Furthermore , finding large prospective study suggest possible relation migraine vascular disorder even large , show patient migraine aura carry high risk develop stroke also myocardial infarction , compare suffer migraine ( 11 ) . The mechanisms relate migraine stroke unknown . The possible mechanism might relate migraine stroke : 1 . The pathophysiological vascular change occur migraine direct ( migraineous infarction ) indirect cause stroke ( 12 ) . 2 . Migraineurs primary endothelial disorder could express several vascular aspect migraine , stroke , Renauld 's phenomenon PFO . 3 . Migraine stroke genetically relate familial hemiplegic migraine . 4 . Migraine accompany , cause , ongoing inflammatory process cause stroke ( 13 ) . C reactive protein ( CRP ) sensitive marker inflammatory process , rise quickly response inflammation tissue damage . CRP marker also involved identification pathogen , activation complementary system phagocytic response , therefore , important role protection infection ( 14 ) . It also role restoration structure activity damage tissue ( 15 ) . On hand , high level CRP relate high risk develop cardiovascular disease stroke ( 16 , 17 ) . CRP might primary risk factor disorder ( 18 , 19 ) possibly inflammatory hypercoagulability mechanism ( 20 , 21 ) . Nevertheless , significant correlation find CRP atherosclerosis . The data relation migraine inflammation limit . In retrospective study , control group , data patient consider complicate medical problem neurologist collect patient ' file . Out 60 patient migraine ( 50 % migraine aura ) 43 % high CRP level ( &gt; 3mg % ; 55 % migraine without aura 32 % migraine aura ) ( 22 ) . A prospective study 50 migraineurs ( 64 % aura ) find significantly high CRP level migraine group compare control , previous study , migraine without aura high level CRP ( 23 ) . These finding possibly point relation migraine inflammation . Aim study To examine value 'baseline inflammatory profile ' patient migraine without aura comparison control group order identify inflammatory marker . A . Main study objective : evaluate level inflammatory marker patient migraine high compare level marker control group . B . Secondary study objective : evaluate level inflammatory marker in-between migraine form headache .</detailed_description>
