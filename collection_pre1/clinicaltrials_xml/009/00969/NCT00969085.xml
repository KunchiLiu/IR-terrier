	<brief_title>Trial Curcumin Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Curcumin : Curcumin , yellow substance take plant , commonly use cooking spice call turmeric . In study , participant receive much high dose curcumin receive food . Curcumin may block protein help cell divide . These protein also may stop cancer cell die . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , swallow 2 stick curcumin per day . You take 2 stick morning food enough water able swallow . If miss take dose curcumin morning , take later day ( soon remember ) . However , miss dose day , take 2 dos next day make . Study Visits : You ask return study visit . At `` baseline '' ( Day 1 ) , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask rate itch scale 0-10 . - You complete 2 quality-of-life questionnaire . - The study staff take photo 6 select skin lesion ( ) . These close-up photo lesion small area surround skin . `` Half-body '' photo also take . These front , back , and/or side view top bottom half body , depend lesion . For half-body photo , private area cover ( much possible ) , face include photo unless lesion . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test - You complete 2 `` quality-of-life '' questionnaire ask symptom disease may affect life . This take 5 minute . - You physical exam , include skin lesion affect area skin look study doctor . - If study doctor think need , skin biopsy perform . To perform skin biopsy , area numb anesthetic small amount tissue ( size pencil eraser ) remove special tool . The following test procedure perform Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 : - You physical exam , include skin lesion affect area skin look study doctor . - You complete 2 quality-of-life questionnaire . - Your vital sign measure . - You ask rate itch scale 0-10 . At Weeks 2 , 4 , 12 , follow additional test perform : -Just like baseline , skin lesion photo half-body photo take . At Weeks 4 , 12 , 20 , follow additional test perform : -Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If doctor decides need base abnormal blood test screen , additional blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check status disease Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 . If time study skin disease seem clear , skin biopsy perform order confirm response . Length Study Participation : You may continue receive study drug 6 month , long study doctor think benefit take curcumin . If disease get bad intolerable side effect occur time study , take study . End-of-Treatment Visit : When go study reason , end-of-treatment visit . The following procedure perform : - You physical exam . - You ask rate itch scale 0-10 . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor decides need base abnormal blood test screen , additional blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check status disease . - A skin biopsy perform check status disease . - Photos skin lesion ( ) take . - You complete 2 quality-of-life questionnaire . - You CT and/or PET scan check size lymph node . Follow-Up : Every 3 month 6 month last dose study drug , study staff check result routine test perform regular follow-up visit MF SS . If visit clinic one two 3-month time period , call home 3 month and/or 6 month last dose study drug . The purpose phone call ask . This investigational study . Curcumin FDA approve commercially available treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . For purpose , use research . Up 20 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
