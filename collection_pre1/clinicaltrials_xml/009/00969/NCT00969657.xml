	<brief_summary>Background study : Prediction rectal tumor response chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) might helpful individualize treatment strategy , i.e. , select patient need less invasive surgery another radiotherapy strategy instead resection . For rectal cancer know 10-30 % patient respond pathologic complete response ( pCR ) CRT . From retrospective study multivariate analysis clinical 2- [ 18F ] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) data , find add FDG-PET data collect CRT lead predictive model compare evaluate pretreatment clinical data . To validate model , registration study propose . Furthermore , find FDG-PET treatment predictive response favorable time point adapt treatment . Also , indication add blood biomarkers data , result higher accuracy response prediction compare clinical imaging data alone . Therefore , FDG-PET treatment blood sample include protocol improve accuracy prediction model . Objective study : The long-term research objective able select rectum cancer patient could receive less invasive treatment . If prediction response possible , surgery may avoid complete response chemoradiotherapy expect perform small incision stage reduction significant . This support decision system help individualize patient treatment improve quality life patient . Study design : 28x radiotherapy . On day 15 radiotherapy en 8 week radiotherapy : 1 PET-CT scan Before radiotherapy , day 15 8 week radiotherapy : blood sample take .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>General objective The long-term research objective able select rectum cancer patient could receive less invasive treatment . If prediction response possible , surgery may avoid complete response chemoradiotherapy expect perform small incision stage reduction significant . This support decision system help individualize patient treatment improve quality life patient . Aim study The main aim validate predictive model pathologic complete response ( ypT0N0 ) rectal cancer patient treat chemoradiotherapy multi-centric prospective data collection . The second aim collect extra data improvement accuracy prediction model new variable . This new model validate later model development process . Hypothesis General hypothesis : The validated accuracy predictive model pathologic complete response chemoradiotherapy rectal cancer patient high enough tailor treatment ( surgery/non-surgery and/or administer extra radiation boost ) clinical practice . Specific hypothesis : 1 . The performance develop model validation data least equal performance achieve model development process . 2 . The performance new model base addition variable performs well previous model</detailed_description>
