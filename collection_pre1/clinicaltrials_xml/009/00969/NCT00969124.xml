	<brief_summary>The Third Eye Retroscope device use colonoscope improve ability physician see area colon may hide view colonoscope . Previous study show physician able detect additional polyp use device along colonoscope . The purpose study determine whether physician detect great number additional polyp gain experience device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Experience Results With Third Eye Retroscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : This study intend determine characteristic `` learn curve '' use Third Eye Retroscope colonoscopy , term efficacy detection abnormality colon time-efficiency endoscopists Device Description : The Third Eye Retroscope auxiliary imaging device design allow visualization `` hidden area '' colonoscopy provide additional , retrograde view complement forward view colonoscope . After standard colonoscope advance cecum , Third Eye Retroscope insert instrument channel colonoscope . As emerges distal tip colonoscope , Third Eye Retroscope automatically bend 180 degree form `` J '' shape . Its sensor provide continuous retrograde view colon throughout process withdrawal colonoscope . The retrograde view assist endoscopist visualize proximal aspect haustral fold rectal valve , well area behind flexure ileocecal valve . With additional point-of-view , endoscopist may able detect lesion miss forward-viewing colonoscope . Study Design : Patients schedule colonoscopy recruit study examine Third Eye Retroscope conjunction standard colonoscope . For polyp find , endoscopist indicate whether could see colonoscope , could find colonoscope first detect Third Eye . Each investigator perform colonoscopy 20 patient , segment four quartile accord order procedure . Mean result quartile compare order evaluate learn curve Third Eye colonoscopy .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . The patient undergo colonoscopy screening , surveillance followup previous polypectomy diagnostic workup ; 2 . The patient must understand provide write consent procedure . 1 . Patients history colonic resection ; 2 . Patients inflammatory bowel disease ; 3 . Patients personal history polyposis syndrome ; 4 . Patients suspect chronic stricture potentially preclude complete colonoscopy ; 5 . Patients diverticulitis toxic megacolon ; 6 . Patients history radiation therapy abdomen pelvis . 7 . Patients currently enrol another clinical investigation intervention might compromise safety patient 's participation study .</criteria>
