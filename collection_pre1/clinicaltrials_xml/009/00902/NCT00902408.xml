	<brief_summary>After pilot trial show substantial increase plasma lutein level increase macular pigment optical density 3 month daily consumption lutein-enriched egg-beverage , propose study effect change subject early ( undiagnosed ) stag macular degeneration . Age-related macula degeneration , lead cause blindness many developed country [ 1-6 ] old person ( usually 55 year age ) . Visual compromise rise exponentially age 70 [ 7 ] 5-year incidence around 1 % . The incidence bilateral AMD person unilateral late ARM observe period 10 year 50 % 2.1-2.8 % overall incidence study population [ 8 ] . To date curative way fight AMD . With result trial hope show daily consumption enrich beverage , slow progression AMD . ( Protocol page 8-10 )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : In pilot study ( MEC 07-1-127 ) saw increase plasma macular level lutein zeaxanthin . Current believe increase might help deterioration retina see age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) scavenge free radical filter harmful blue light ray [ 1 , 2 ] . For purpose establish whether believe hold truth , want investigate effect lutein zeaxanthin increase subject early sign AMD visual acuity , visual field contrast sensibility . To relate result previous study also measure change plasma macular concentration xanthophyll . Once use egg-beverage pilot study . These proven safe show change lipid level 3 month consumption . Objective : To assess whether increase macular pigment optical density healthy subject see change visual function year intervention . Study design : This randomize , double blind , placebo control , interventional trial . Subjects randomize , stratify gender age , two group ( N=50 ) receive either intervention product ( base 1.5 yolk lutein enrich egg contain 0.921 ± 0.106mg lutein 0.137 ± 0.014mg zeaxanthin per yolk ) placebo . Subject follow 1 year see three time measurement . Study population : 100 subject , age 50 old drusen and/or Retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) alteration retinal image . Main study parameters/endpoints : Changes amount early macular degeneration sign fundus photograph . Macular pigment optical density . Plasma lutein zeaxanthin level . Nature extend burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Subjects see three time total 22 ( + 1 hour screen ) hour . Methods use trial commonly use technique prove safe either previous trial clinical practice . Subjects ' sight limit investigated eye hour every visit use Tropicamide , standard practice ophthalmology department sporadic , treatable side effect ( acute angle-closure glaucoma 0.03 % ) . Subjects intervention group expect show slow progression disease placebo group . We use egg-beverage pilot study show change lipid level .</detailed_description>
