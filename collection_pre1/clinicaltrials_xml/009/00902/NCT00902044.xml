	<brief_summary>Patients type cancer call sarcoma . The sarcoma come back treatment . Because standard treatment patient cancer time currently use treatment work fully case , patient ask volunteer take part gene transfer research study use special immune cell . The body different way fight infection disease . No single way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight disease : antibody T cell . We hope work well together . Antibodies proteins protect body disease cause germ toxic substance . They work bind germ substance , stop grow exert toxic effect . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting blood cell kill cell , include tumor cell cell infected germ . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer : show promise , strong enough cure patient . We find previous research put new gene T cell make recognize cancer cell kill . We want see put new gene cell let T cell recognize kill sarcoma cell . The new gene put make antibody specific HER2 ( Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ) bind sarcoma cell . In addition contains CD28 , stimulate T cell make last longer . In clinical study use T cell , investigator find give chemotherapy T cell infusion improve amount time T cell stay body therefore effect T cell . Giving chemotherapy T cell infusion call lymphodepletion since chemotherapy specifically choose decrease number lymphocytes body . Decreasing number patient 's lymphocyte first allow T cell infuse expand stay longer body , potentially kill cancer cell effectively . We use fludarabine combination cyclophosphamide fludarabine chemotherapy agent lymphodepletion . Cyclophosphamide fludarabine chemotherapy agent commonly use lymphodepletion immunotherapy clinical trial . The purpose study find large safe dose chimeric T cell , learn side effect , see whether therapy might help patient sarcoma . Another purpose see safe give HER2-CD28 T cell lymphodepleting chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Because cell new gene patient follow total 15 year see long term side effect gene transfer . When patient enrol study , assign dose HER2-CD28 T cell . Depending dose level assign , receive one following : HER2-CD28 T cell fludarabine ( patient receive fludarabine 5 day follow injection HER2-CD28 T cell ) OR HER2-CD28 T cell , fludarabine cyclophosphamide ( patient receive cyclophosphamide 2 day receive fludarabine 5 day receive HER2-CD28 T cell ) . The HER2-CD28 T cell give vein IV line . The injection take 1 10 minute . The patient follow clinic injection 1 4 hour . Each patient follow 6 week T-cell infusion evaluation toxicity . They standard test procedure well research blood draw . If patient stable disease ( tumor grow ) reduction size tumor image study T-cell infusion , receive additional dos T cell 6 12 week interval . For first two subsequent HER2-specific T-cell infusion , patient able receive additional lymphodepleting chemotherapy accord dose level .</detailed_description>
