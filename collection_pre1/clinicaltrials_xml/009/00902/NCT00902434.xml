	<brief_summary>This exploratory analysis investigate pattern care patient age 80 diagnose non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . This study look dose intensity density implement patient population calculate whether patient receive full course therapy , receive less duration treatment , receive low dos drug administer . Furthermore , investigator would explore time disease progression patient regardless treatment receive investigate whether patient outcome differ base type therapy dose intensity/density give . This study look retrospectively evaluate patient NHL age 80 institution 2001-2007 . It anticipate 50 patient include study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Elderly Patients Above Age 80 Rituximab Era</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ( NHL ) malignant disease lymphoid hematopoetic system annual incidence 60,000 cases/year United States account 18,000 death annually . NHL heterogeneous malignancy median age 65 time diagnosis . Most clinical trial establish current standard care include elderly patient , especially age 80 . Reasons representation well-defined several factor hypothesize . Patients age 80 many co-morbid condition might exclude enrollment clinical study usually design fit individual . In addition , investigator often reluctant propose trial elderly patient response therapy might suboptimal compare young patient affect overall data . Well-designed published study patient age 80 manage community academic setting lacking . There agreed-upon treatment algorithm patient recommend approach varies base treat physician , institution , individual patient . Some physician choose offer dose reduction others might omit chemotherapy use monoclonal antibody alone . Furthermore , treatment duration number cycle give might vary considerably patient subgroup variety reason , mainly toxicity . In addition , unclear whether histologic distribution NHL similar old patient . In word , clear whether patient age 80 commonly diagnose diffuse large cell lymphoma ( DLCL ) follicular lymphoma ( FL ) similar young individual . Most importantly , expect variation treatment strategy might inferior outcome compare young patient population . Looking histologic subtype , treatment strategy , outcomes patient age 80 useful patient physician alike . It plausible current standard apply very-older patient population argue offer clinical trial novel agent even initial approach . On hand , might discover old patient fare well despite variation argue disease biology different especially note change histologic distribution .</detailed_description>
