	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare different endovascular treatment modality femoropopliteal segment , determine technical success , efficacy patency mid-term follow-up . Modalities include ; Angioplasty/stent ( Control group , Guidant ) , Cryoplasty/stent ( Boston Scientific ) , Laser Angioplasty/stent ( Spectranetics ) , SilverHawk Atherectomy/stent ( Fox Hollow ) , Viabahn Endograft ( WL Gore ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prime Time Superficial Femoral Artery ( SFA ) - The SFA Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral vascular occlusive disease progressive often debilitate form atherosclerosis affect vessel upper low extremity . Patients typically present complaint pain involved extremity ( claudication ) , others present numbness , heaviness , fatigue affect limb . With regard progression disease , 10 % patient intermittent claudication may progress limb loss course 5 year . Past study indicate 2/3 patient ' symptom remain stable . Most recent study , however , suggest natural history result disable symptom . These patient evaluate non-invasive study include Ankle-Brachial Indices ( ABI ) arterial duplex ass arterial flow . If stenosis total occlusion identify , invasive study ( angiogram ) may necessary . From study able determine patient candidate either traditional surgical procedure ( bypass ) percutaneous treatment , similar angiogram . The superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) region difficult treat maintain patency . Stenosis and/or occlusion often occur 6 month . Results balloon angioplasty stenting femoropopliteal segment part variable often poor result . The SFA popliteal artery extremely difficult treat diffuse nature disease , high degree recoil , amplified reactivity , large number occlusion , calcification , impact inflow run-off . Angioplasty alone , limited high frequency dissection , significant recoil , unacceptably high restenosis rate . While stenting make acute impact dissection recoil , restenosis rate modestly improve time . More aggressive stent utilization create problem ; in-stent restenosis , occlusion stent-strut fracture . Now , percutaneous revascularization become option many patient due minimal invasive nature . Various modality use recently treat femoropopliteal region , include cool laser , atherectomy , cryoplasty endoluminal graft attempt obtain long-lasting result . At present , study compare use device different stent anatomical location . Randomization do intervention open seal envelope contain type procedure . All procedure do systemic heparinization use 3 5K ui IV heparin . All case approach percutaneously contralateral CFA prevent access site interfere patency outcome ( i.e. , antegrade approach ) . The use stent adjunctive Rx laser , atherectomy , balloon angioplasty cryoplasty case sole decision interventionist . PTA stent control group . To maintain uniformity , stent use entire series Guidant `` Absolute '' stent . The laser probe use study , 2.0 , 2.2 , 2.5 mm ( 0.35 compatible ) concentric catheter - Spectranetics . The endoluminal graft series Viabahn - W.L . Gore . The use closure device access site , decision interventionist . All patient treat post-op Plavix 75 mg orally three month start day intervention . All subject evaluate pre-procedure , 2 week , 3 , 6 , 12 month . Subject follow-up 2 week , 3 , 6 , 12 month include Bilateral ABIs , Arterial Duplex , Complete Physical Exam/Clinical Symptoms ( presence pulse ) .</detailed_description>
