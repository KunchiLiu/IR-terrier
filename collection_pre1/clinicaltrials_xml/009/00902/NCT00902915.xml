	<criteria>Understand voluntarily sign informed consent form . Age least 18 year time signing informed consent form . MM ( stage ) acute light chain induce renal impairment Patients previously unknown MM acute light chain induce renal failure ( GFR &lt; 50ml/min serum creatinine minimum 2.0 mg/dL ) workup reveal light chain induce renal injury MM underlying cause . Patients previously establish MM normal renal function ( GFR ≥60ml/min serum creatinine ≤1.2mg/dl ) progressive disease acute ( within 6 week ) light chain induce renal failure ( GFR &lt; 50ml/min creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL ) . Disease progression document one follow criterion : Increase serum paraprotein &gt; 25 % , increase 50 % 24 hour urine paraprotein excretion Hypercalcemia Progression bone lesion Decrease Hb &gt; 2g/dl within 4 week ( induced cytotoxic drug ) Increase bone marrow plasma cell infiltration &gt; 25 % All previous medical antimyeloma therapy ( exclude corticosteroid ) must discontinue least 3 week prior treatment study . Able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . Measurable serum urine paraprotein Laboratory test result within range : Glomerular filtration rate &lt; 50ml/min Serum creatinine ≥ 2.0mg/dL Absolute leukocyte count ≥ 1.5 x 10G/L Platelet count minimum 75 x 10G/L bone marrow plasma cell infiltration ( BMPC ) ≥50 % minimum 30 x 10G/L BMPC infiltration &lt; 50 % . Total bilirubin minimum 1.5 mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) 2,5 x ULN Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) must : Understand study medication could expect teratogenic risk Agree use , able comply , effective contraception without interruption , 4 week start study drug , throughout study drug therapy ( include dose interruption ) 4 week end study drug therapy , even amenorrhea . This apply unless subject commits absolute continued abstinence confirm monthly basis . The following effective method contraception : Implant , Levonorgestrelreleasing intrauterine system ( IUS , Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot ) , Tubal sterilization , Sexual intercourse vasectomise male partner ; vasectomy must confirm two negative semen analyse Ovulation inhibitory progesteroneonly pill ( i.e. , desogestrel ) Agree medically supervise pregnancy test minimum sensitivity 25 mIU/ml 3 day start study medication subject effective contraception least 4 week . This requirement also apply woman childbearing potential practice complete continue abstinence . Agree medically supervise pregnancy test every 4 week include 4 week end study treatment , except case confirm tubal sterilization . These test perform 3 day start next treatment . This requirement also apply woman childbearing potential practice complete continue abstinence . Male subject must : Agree use condom throughout study drug therapy , dose interruption 28 day cessation study therapy partner childbearing potential contraception . Agree donate semen study drug therapy 28 day end study drug therapy . All subject must agree share study medication another person return unused study drug investigator Disease free prior malignancy minimum 3 year exception currently treat basal cell , squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma `` situ '' cervix breast Agree take low molecular weight heparin prophylactic anticoagulation . Acute renal failure due cause lightchain induced nephropathy NSAIRS , antibiotic , nephrotoxic drug , others . Acute renal failure due hypercalcemia , without excretion nephrotoxic light chain . Any serious medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject signing informed consent form . Any prior use lenalidomide Any antimyeloma therapy within 3 week day 1 first cycle , exception dexamethasone 40mg ( maximum dose 160mg ) corticosteroid equivalent .
