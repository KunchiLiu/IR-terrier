	<detailed_description>The development biomarkers especially critical , number promising disease-modifying therapy enter early phase clinical trial , additional novel therapeutic strategy development . It essential develop biomarkers detect `` signal efficacy '' relatively short time frame use Phase II trial . Ideally biomarkers need reliably detect early brain alteration due AD pathology , perhaps point synaptic dysfunction yet widespread neuronal loss . Functional neuroimaging , particular functional MRI ( fMRI ) , significant potential , already show promise detect regionally specific pharmacological effect memory related neural activity , sensitive marker early cognitive impairment . This study , parallel ancillary study Alzheimer 's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ( ADNI ) , first examine reproducibility fMRI activation , use face-name associative memory paradigm , alteration memory-related activation occur course MCI mild AD . The study also examine relationship fMRI activation clinical variable , memory task performance , genotype , image technique cross-sectionally longitudinally , sample multiple time point 3-year period .</detailed_description>
