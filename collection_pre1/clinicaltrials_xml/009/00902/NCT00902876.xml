	<brief_summary>The purpose multi-center study determine efficacy safety Mucograft® combination coronally advanced flap ( CAF ) treatment gingival recession . It assume CAF combine Mucograft® result improve outcome term percentage root coverage soft tissue thickness comparison CAF alone ( control ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Evaluate Safety Effectiveness CAF + Mucograft® Compared CAF Alone Patients With Gingival Recessions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary goal mucogingival surgery change time maintain gingival health prevent progression recession provide predictable root coverage solve patient ' esthetic demand . Many surgical technique utilize restore gingival tissue dimension include use autologous soft tissue graft . Longitudinal study show procedure use pedicle free graft effective purpose . However , since technique use epithelialized graft , generally result compromise aesthetic ( `` patch-like area '' ) . Alternatively free connective tissue graft ( CTG ) use provide similar predictability result good colour matching . Unfortunately , technique associate significant patient morbidity due wound palatal donor site . To avoid patient morbidity , acellular dermal allograft use substitute palatal donor tissue , demonstrate possible promising use allograft material . However , since allograft material derive human cadaver ; associate ethical concern risk disease transmission . In patient residual amount keratinize tissue , coronally advanced flap ( CAF ) - first introduce Norber et al . ( 1926 ) - demonstrate effective treatment multiple single recession advantage term aesthetic morbidity . Although CAF safe predictable approach root coverage , application surgical technique conjunction autologous synthetic material report enhance probability achieve complete root coverage Miller Class I II gingival recession . A promising option avoid patient morbidity use autologous transplant allograft use collagen matrix porcine origin , Mucograft® . Similar device extensively use guided tissue regeneration procedure . Mucograft® provide ideal matrix blood vessel soft tissue ingrowth , likely improve result predictability recession coverage procedure use CAF .</detailed_description>
