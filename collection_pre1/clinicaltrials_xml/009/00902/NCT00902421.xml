	<brief_summary>The urologic literature suggest association variety psychiatric disorder incontinence . Most notably , depression find significant percentage patient urinary incontinence . Depression also occur condition associate urinary urge incontinence , age dementia , neurologic disorder normal pressure hydrocephalus . Correction neurologic disorder eliminate depression urge incontinence . Although chronic medical disorder urge incontinence may lead depression , alternative hypothesis two condition share common neurochemical pathogenesis . Lowering monoamine serotonin noradrenaline central nervous system ( CNS ) lead depression urinary frequency hyperactive bladder experimental animal . Thus , depression may result persistent urinary incontinence , individual alter CNS monoamine could manifest depression overactive bladder . The latter condition may lead urge incontinence , urinary frequency , urgency , enuresis . Uncovering evidence linkage could serve basis development genetic marker novel therapeutic intervention two condition . In study , investigator evaluate efficacy safety SSRI OAB patient respond antimuscarinic agent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- 3-month , prospective , open-label , comparative trial - Primary Objectives : - To investigate change OAB symptom patient show therapeutic benefit 3 month treatment antimuscarinic agent treat SSRI ( escitalopram ) 3 month . - Secondary Objectives - To investigate change patient perception urgency bladder condition - To investigate change patient perception quality life - To investigate change psychologic parameter - To investigate patient perception treatment benefit - To find predictive factor patient respond 3 month-treatment escitalopram - To explore efficacy escitalopram tolerability safety</detailed_description>
