	<brief_summary>The goal randomize clinical trial investigate optimal treat eye disease epiretinal fibrosis . Hypothesis : In population patient symptomatic idiopathic epiretinal fibrosis visual acuity 0.4 , best long term outcome measure visual acuity achieve early surgery compare periodic control continual loss visual acuity ensure follow surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epiretinal Fibrosis , Effect Early Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epiretinal fibrosis disease macula , affect central retina , central vision . Epiretinal fibrosis due growth connective tissue retina surface . From population study show 15 % patient epiretinal fibrosis develop moderate severe loss visual acuity . Earlier study show surgery remove epiretinal membrane often lead improvement visual acuity normalization . The reason everyone normalization visual acuity could growth connective deep layer retina . This intraretinal fibrosis develop time presumed worsen duration condition . In patient symptomatic epiretinal fibrosis visual acuity 0,4 , current clinical practice utilize wait see approach , hold treatment make sure patient visual acuity decline . With wait see approach avoid surgery eye would remain stable visual acuity . On hand approach always ensure surgery eye deteriorate visual acuity , usually point 0,1-0,3 long duration disease . Hence result delay surgery presumably bad could achieve operate earlier point . This project aim investigate give patient favorable long term result surgery earlier compare traditional wait see approach . This study prospective randomize clinical trial . We aim include 60 patient , 20 randomize early surgery ( intervention ) 40 close follow-up program ( control ) . If patient control group loss 10 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) letter follow-up request surgery epiretinal fibrosis offer operation intervention group . The Intervention group clear lens extraction already operate cataract . This within 4 week inclusion , another 4 week epiretinal fibrosis remove par plana vitrectomy . There clinical control 3,6,9 12 month inclusion/surgery group .</detailed_description>
