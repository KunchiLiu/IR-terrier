	<brief_summary>Antimalarial drug resistance increase nearly everywhere tropical world , confound global attempt `` Roll Back Malaria . '' South East Asia resistant malaria parasites world . This limited option treatment region . Artemisinin-based combination therapy recommend treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria . The success policy change practice depend efficacy component combination use , population coverage achieve , high level adherence treatment , low cost drug , preferably drug combination treatment formulate single tablet , prevent one drug take without partner drug . Until recently two artemisinin-based fixed combination available , artemether-lumefantrine dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ; former international registration . More fixed combination need urgently .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malaria Myanmar : In Myanmar , malaria number one cause morbidity . According Department Health ( DoH ) WHO approximately 500,000 patient malaria year . About 80 % report infection due Plasmodium falciparum 20 % due Plasmodium vivax . This likely severe underestimation . MSF-Holland alone treat already 250,000 slide positive malaria patient per year area mixed endemicity cover population le 1 million patient total population 54 million country . Chloroquine first line treatment falciparum malaria last five decade . In 1996 1998 MSF-Holland support Wellcome Trust ( Prof N. White ) perform study northern western part country , high in-vivo resistance level chloroquine sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine demonstrated1,2 . Combination treatment mefloquine plus artesunate ( loose tablet ) [ MA ( LT ) ] treatment dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DP ) prove highly efficacious ( 99-100 % ) 3,4 . The study perform MSF provide important component evidence use convince health authority change national protocol need . In 2001 , DOH Myanmar change national protocol treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria ; 3 day treatment mefloquine-artesunate chosen become first line treatment . Artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) DP also mention national protocol effective treatment regimen , call protocol research treatment . These change policy good step forward widely respect . In practice , problem remain . MSF implement large malaria activity Myanmar past decade . The programme perform diagnostic test malaria approximately 3,000,000 patient approximately 1,500,000 patient treat artemisinin combination treatment ( ACT ) .</detailed_description>
