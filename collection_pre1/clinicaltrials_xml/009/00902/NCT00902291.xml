	<brief_title>A Study AGS-1C4D4 Given Combination With Gemcitabine Subjects With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A disease assessment perform study week 8 ( ± 3 day ) investigator . The assessment base change clinical symptom , radiographic image . Subjects without evidence disease progression may continue receive treatment base original treatment assignment disease progression intolerability . Disease assessment perform every 8 week extended period . A safety follow-up visit occur 4 week last dose infusion AGS-1C4D4 and/or gemcitabine . Post-Treatment : Subjects terminate protocol therapy reason unrelated document disease progression follow telephone contact every 2 month begin new anticancer therapy , disease progress , die , become lose follow-up withdrawal consent follow-up , whichever event occur first . Overall survival : All subject follow telephone contact every 2 month death , loss follow-up , withdrawal consent , whichever event occur first .</detailed_description>
