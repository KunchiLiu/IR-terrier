	<brief_title>Study To Check The Analgesic And Anti-Inflammatory Effects Of Atorvastatin In Patients Undergoing Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study type : Double Blind Placebo Controlled Method Randomization : Computer Generated Table No . patient recruit : 40 Accept Healthy Volunteers : No Drugs administer : Atorvastatin 20 patient placebo 20 patient Mode drug administration : Oral Duration Study : 3 week Patients attend Surgical O.P.D Obstetrics Gynaecology O.P.D diagnose condition require elective abdominal surgery spinal anaesthesia choose screening . Patients undergoing day care surgery spinal anaesthesia abdominal incision also include screen . Two week decide date surgery patient call screening . The patient first screen obesity , risk factor CVS diseases blood withdrawn estimation serum lipid level . Further risk assessment patient do accord NCEP ATP III Guidelines ( 2004 Revision NCEP Adult Treatment Panel III Guidelines ) . If patient moderate risk category fit inclusion criterion he/she call next week start atorvastatin/placebo . Patients define dyslipidemic moderate risk category accord NCEP ATP III Guidelines i.e patient would benefit statin therapy give atorvastatin 10 mg placebo start one week expect date surgery . They explain possible A.D.R statin therapy . Informed consent form fill . On day surgery patient explain Visual Analouge Scale Wong Pain Scale . After operation patient start S.O.S analgesic therapy . The protocol use follow surgical ward . In case severe pain opioids use . For type pain tolerated patient Diclofenac Sodium use . The patient monitor surgery total dose analgesic require relief pain . Further time first dose analgesic require operation note . The patient monitor pain incision site 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 , 24 hour operation use visual analogue scale Wong Pain Scale . Later use abovementioned scale patient 's pain monitor twice daily patient discharge . The McGill Pain Questionnaire give patient first day every day thereafter till patient discharge . After discharge patient follow day suture removal pain score evaluate . The patient ask come weekly till end study period . Blood withdrawn estimation serum lipid level , total leukocyte count , C - reactive protein TNF-Î± level baseline ( i.e day start therapy ) , day surgery surgery fourth postoperative day . All blood sample take 10A.M-12P.M Wound healing monitor daily basis discharge weekly thereafter . The attend surgeon monitor wound discharge , swell , etc . Additional sign inflammation infection like swell , fever , erythema also monitor . The patient instruct take atorvastatin placebo day three week ( One week preoperative two week postoperative ) . At end period patient ask continue statin outside . In event patient unable afford medication wean statin gradual manner .</detailed_description>
