	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate compare immune response two vaccine 4 related bacteria : meningococcal serogroups A , C , W−135 Y . These bacteria cause meningitis /or septicaemia ( blood poisoning ) . The two vaccine protein−polysaccharide conjugate vaccine ( MenACWY ) meningococcal plain polysaccharide vaccine ( MenACWY PS ) . Both vaccine license currently use traveller area high incidence invasive meningococcal disease . However , plain polysaccharide vaccine know poorly immunogenic child stimulate immunological memory , apart serogroup A component . In contrast , protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine meningococcal serogroups A , C , W−135 Y find immunogenic infant able induce immunological memory . The propose study single centre , open−label , randomise , control study 150 healthy adult age 18−70 year . The participant give either 2 injection meningococcal protein−polysaccharide conjugate vaccine one month apart , one injection meningococcal plain polysaccharide vaccine follow one month later injection meningococcal conjugate vaccine . Blood sample collect immunisation several time point follow immunisation evaluate level meningococcal specific antibody induce two different vaccination regime . The data derive study relevant determine vaccine use preference traveller receive immunisation meningococcal disease travel high risk area . Additionally , number scientific question regard nature immune response two vaccine ( specifically look white blood cell responsible produce antibody , know B cell ) role genetic variation influence vaccine recipient 's immune response address study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In single centre , open−label , randomise , control study 150 healthy adult age 18−70 year evaluate immune response immunisation 2 different vaccine 4 related bacteria know Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A , C , W−135 Y . These bacteria ( also know meningococci ) produce meningitis septicaemia ( blood poisoning ) . The first vaccine , use travel vaccine UK several year , know MenACWY plain polysaccharide ( MenACWY PS ) . The vaccine , know MenACWY conjugate vaccine ( MenACWY ) license UK March 2010 recommend travel vaccine Department Health . In order evaluate immune response vaccine measure blood level antibody specific serogroup A , C , W−135 Y meningococci , also population white blood cell know B cell produce antibody . Two form B cell measure , plasma cell ( actively produce antibody ) memory B cell ( produce antibody persist body stimulate turn plasma cell require ) . Participants randomise group I group II 1:1 basis receive either MenACWY MenACWY PS . One month later , participant receive booster dose MenACWY conjugate vaccine . The ACWY polysaccharide vaccine administer subcutaneously , MenACWY conjugate vaccine give intramuscularly . Each participant observe least 15 minute vaccination immediate reaction . Blood sample collect participant analysis prior immunisation , 7 day follow first immunisation 7 28 day follow second immunisation . The volume blood sample obtain timepoint 20 mLs . Blood use antibody analysis ( ELISA ) , B cell analysis ( ELISpot ) DNA extraction genetic analysis . In summary , participant enrol study total 5 visit period 2 month . They receive two dos MenACWY conjugate vaccine one dose ACWY polysaccharide vaccine follow one dose MenACWY conjugate vaccine . During period total 5 blood sample take ( 5x20mL= 100 mL blood take 2 month period ) .</detailed_description>
