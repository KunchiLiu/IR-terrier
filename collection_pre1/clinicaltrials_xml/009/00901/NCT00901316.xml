	<brief_title>Prevention Recurrent Infections Caused Community Acquired Staphylococcus Aureus ( CA-SA ) Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In many area United States , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus establish community pathogen ( CA-MRSA ) . At Texas Children 's Hospital ( TCH ) , 75 % S. aureus isolates recover healthy child infection CA-MRSA &gt; 90 % CA-MRSA isolate related one clone , USA300 , also predominate throughout U.S. From 8/05 7/06 , 1400 child CA-MRSA infection see TCH ; 60 % admitted hospital . Why USA300 clone successful spread throughout community unclear , harbor unique set gene find S. aureus clone . The anterior nose common area body colonize S. aureus know primary site colonization CA-MRSA USA300 clone . Approximately 3.5 % child TCH proven recurrence S. aureus infection within 12 month ; believe minimal estimate overall least 10 % child recurrence . There consensus best strategy prevent recurrent S. aureus infection spread S. aureus among family member . At TCH , addition routine preventative measure , often recommend patient take bath least twice week water one teaspoon household bleach ( Clorox ) add per gallon water . Anecdotally approach decreased recurrence rate S. aureus infection , common strategy among dermatologist formally evaluate thus controversial . Objectives The primary objective test hypothesis child community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus ( CA-SA ) infection , sodium hypochlorite bath ( Clorox ) safe effective component prevention strategy reduce recurrent medically attend skin soft tissue infection ( MA-SSI ) . Specific Aims 1 . Determine recurrence rate ( 12 month period ) medically attend skin soft tissue infection visit child initially evaluate TCH Emergency Center 3 month prevention strategy include take bath twice week water sodium hypochlorite ( Clorox ) add recurrence rate child similar prevention strategy recommend without bath component . 2 . Determine recurrence rate ( 12 month period ) skin soft tissue infection cause CA-S. aureus child 3-month prevention strategy include take bath twice week water sodium hypochlorite ( Clorox ) add recurrence rate child similar prevention strategy recommend without bath component . 3 . Determine + rate S. aureus colonization anterior naris , pharynx , groin child evaluate emergency center Texas Children 's Hospital ( TCH ) admit TCH suspect S. aureus infection .</detailed_description>
