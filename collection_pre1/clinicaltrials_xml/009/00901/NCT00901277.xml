	<brief_summary>The study three-arm design 600 patient hospitalize post-MI recruit large hospital randomize either education group ( control group ) one two intervention group . Patients randomize one intervention group receive nurse-administered intervention plus use Microsoft 's HealthVault web-based platform solely use Microsoft 's HealthVault web-based platform web-based behavioral intervention , include behavioral/medication management component . The 12 month effect intervention evaluate . For baseline outcome assessment obtain BP , nonfasting LDL , Hb A1c . Patients also survey demographic health behavior baseline 12 month . Study personnel serve liaison subject provider ; however , decision relate clinical care ultimately leave patient 's provider . Subjects serious adverse effect advise assisted seek emergency medical care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supporting Post Myocardial Infarction ( MI ) Risk Modification Intervention Via Telemedicine Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE OF STUDY Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death U.S. , account one third death . Of , coronary heart disease ( CHD ) account great proportion morbidity mortality estimate 770,000 Americans first myocardial infarction ( MI ) additional 430,000 recurrent MI 2008 . To date , much focus improvement evidence-based medical therapy 'in-hospital ' care phase , yet great challenge improve CHD outcome transition hospital home . We test two novel CVD risk reduction intervention provide tailor disease-management support patient recently MI . The first intervention utilize home BP monitor intervention arm , interactive web-based tool base Microsoft 's HealthVault technology ( data transmission , track communication ) , nurse telephone disease-management expand CVD risk management beyond wall hospital clinic . This intervention build prior extensive experience hypertension management include randomize interventional evaluation 2000 patient . This proven approach enhance novel technology broad application namely secondary prevention . Combined , potential enhance post MI access , quality care , ultimately , improve patient outcomes . The second intervention , similar invention arm , utilize home BP monitor interactive web-based tool base Microsoft 's HealthVault technology ( data transmission , track , communication ) , however , second intervention arm include web-based disease-management expand CVD risk management . Thus , two intervention arm similar difference whether individual receive feedback nurse use tailored behavioral telephone base intervention use tailor web-based intervention without direct communication nurse . The two arm allow u test clinical impact cost use tailor web-intervention compare nurse implement tailor intervention . DESIGN AND PROCEDURES The study three-arm design 600 patient hospitalize post-MI recruit large hospital randomize either education group ( control group ) one two intervention group . Patients randomize one two intervention group receive home BP monitor , train 's use access interactive web-based tool base Microsoft 's HealthVault technology ( data transmission , track communication ) . Those intervention arm receive either nurse telephone disease-management intervention web-based disease-management intervention . Those randomized educational control arm , receive usual care information CHD . The 12 month effect intervention evaluate . For baseline assessment outcomes , study obtain BP , nonfasting LDL , Hb A1c . Patients also survey demographic health behavior baseline 12 month . After patient complete measurement battery , patient randomly assign educational control group intervention group , respectively . The project 's masters-level statistician perform entire study randomization patient enrollment begin . Participants randomize use computerized random number generator block ( size &lt; 10 ) within single stratification factor , diabetic status . Additionally , two nurse interventionists deliver intervention nurse-intervention arm , patient randomly allocate nurse blocked fashion ensure approximate even distribution patient nurse . At follow-up measure , RA assign measure BP obtain survey information blind group patient randomize . If patient able complete baseline assessment include BP , LDL-Direct and/or Hb A1c , RA reschedule individual ' appointment complete interview later date . Comorbidities obtain individual ' medical record 12 month study . All patient randomize two intervention arm provide easy-to-use home BP monitor . The primary mean BP monitor plug play uploads reading Microsoft HealthVault application . Participants ask take blood pressure reading daily upload value HealthVault weekly . If diabetic , participant ask upload glucose value take ( recommended provider ) . If participant unable upload reading Microsoft HealthVault application , RA instruct participant enter value application manually . If participant unable unwilling use HealthVault , study provide participant document record home monitor blood pressure glucose reading self address stamp envelope . Every two week ( bi-weekly ) , study ask participant send reading back study staff . The RA enter home monitor blood pressure glucose reading Microsoft HealthVault application . In addition patient ' home monitoring information , patient ' lab value non fast LDL , Hb A1c well important safety monitoring parameter manually enter study 's data repository . SUBJECT RECRUITMENT AND COMPENSATION We enroll 600 subject admit Duke University Medical Center ( DUHS ) MI . Recruitment occur within approximately week 36 month hospital discharge . Subjects randomly assign educational control group one two intervention group respectively . At least 50 % sample woman 40 % African American base upon prior hypertension study use similar enrollment strategy . Subjects receive compensation participation study . CONSENT PROCESS The Research Assistant ( RA ) contact subject within approximately week 36 month hospital discharge . Patients receive letter detail study hospital discharge opportunity opt study . If patient opt , RA contact patient discharge hospital , screen eligibility , describe study , obtain informed consent interview patient . SUBJECT 'S CAPACITY TO GIVE LEGALLY EFFECTIVE CONSENT Subjects competent give consent include study . STUDY INTERVENTIONS In nurse intervention arm , research nurse ( RN ) contact patient within one week enrollment purpose introduction . The schedule intervention module begin initial phone call nurse . In web intervention arm , participant receive e-mail within one week enrol link secure web-page intervention activate . A unique aspect intervention module activate every encounter , module activate specific encounter need . The activation frequency module ( multiple module make encounter ) vary . The first module ( medication side effect ) potentially activate intervention patient every month problem/issue arises ( e.g. , medication change occur patient report new medication side effect ) . The remain module ( patient/provider communication , CVD knowledge/risk perception , health behavior ) activate individual specific encounter . Patients also able telephone nurse question related management disease . Individuals web-based intervention e-mail question study team . Should major emergent health care issue arise , call e-mail communication , nurse immediately notify patient ' primary care provider . In case e-mail communication , information forward participant ' provider . A multibehavioral , comprehensive approach propose one factor show consistently improve CVD outcomes . An important feature intervention incorporate tailor information feedback specifically relevant particular patient . Previous study show effectiveness use early version intervention , address 13 health behavior focus improve patient management CVD relate health behavior . Patients provide evidence-based recommendation regard lifestyle behavior advise achieve goal respect behavior . In nurse arm , verbal information reinforce write visual material mail patient . In web-based arm , material send patient via e-mail . All intervention component design culturally sensitive . The behavioral module include , diet , exercise , smoking , alcohol , stress reduction , memory , patient-provider relationship , medication update , side effect , knowledge/risk perception . In addition , patient use Microsoft HealthVault system access line patient educational material prepare America Heart Association ( AHA ) .</detailed_description>
