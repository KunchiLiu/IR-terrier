	<brief_summary>The standard care head neck lung cancer include chemotherapy , radiation surgery . For patient cancer head neck lung recurs surgery and/or radiation , spread part body , chemotherapy use cisplatin slow tumor growth extend lifespan . The study drug , azacitidine , block ability cancer cell replicate , approve Food Drug Administration use myelodysplastic syndrome , slowly develop blood cell-related cancer . In laboratory animal experiment use head neck lung cancer cell , azacitidine show cisplatin `` helper '' , ( , make cisplatin effective stopping growth head neck lung cancer . ) Since combination azacitidine cisplatin use patient head neck lung cancer , investigator perform study combine azacitidine cisplatin find effect , good and/or bad , study drug may patient advanced head neck lung cancer . The investigator study would like find well treatment type cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine Cisplatin Patients With Advanced Lung Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Azacitidine give standard dose cisplatin . At begin study , three patient treat low dose azacitidine . If dose cause bad side effect , dose slowly make high new patient take part study . Patients receive azacitidine once-a-day subcutaneous ( skin ) injection every day day 1 day 5 28 day study . Cisplatin give intravenously day 8 . This 28-day 4-week period time call cycle . Cycles repeat every four week long physician recommends . During study , patient need follow test procedure . - Physical exam - This do weekly first 2 week every 4-week treatment cycle . - Blood test blood count - These do every week . - Blood test kidney function , liver function , measure electrolytes - These do every week - Blood sample research study - This do weekly first cycle , weekly first 2 week subsequent treatment cycle - X-rays scan - These do every 8 week .</detailed_description>

Patients must able understand sign write informed consent document approve trial . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test prior azacitidine treatment . Patients symptomatic brain metastasis exclude clinical trial . Patients asymptomatic brain metastasis allow . The patient must stable 2 week radiotherapy ; patient corticosteroid , dose cortico steroid must stable 2 week prior first dose study treatment , process taper . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition azacitidine , cisplatin mannitol agent use study .
