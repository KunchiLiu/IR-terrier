	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine progression-free survival [ PFS ] 36 month patient Hodgkin lymphoma achieve complete metabolic response demonstrate negative fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) -PET scan one cycle ABVD ( adriamycin , bleomycin , vinblastine , dacarbazine ) undergo abbreviate ABVD chemotherapy ( 3 cycle ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Abbreviated Chemotherapy Based Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Scan Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study base repeat demonstration patient Hodgkin lymphoma attain negative PET scan early therapy ( one 2 cycle chemotherapy ) uniformly excellent outcome , long term disease free survival 90-95 % . We propose abbreviate chemotherapy patient show complete metabolic response measure FDG-PET one cycle ABVD . These patient undergo two cycle ABVD chemotherapy , total 3 cycle . Those patient fail achieve complete metabolic response demonstrate residual FDG avidity go study treat per primary treating physician .</detailed_description>
