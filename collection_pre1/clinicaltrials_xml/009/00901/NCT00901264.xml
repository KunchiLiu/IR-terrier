	<detailed_description>Identification patient cancer respond specific chemotherapy important making decision regard chemotherapy regimen well alternative management approach . A laboratory test could help determine sensitivity individual patient 's tumor cell specific chemotherapeutic agent would valuable choose optimal chemotherapy regimen patient expectation increase response rate therapy . Several type vitro assay measure tumor cell survival follow exposure cytotoxic agent evaluate ability predict chemotherapy outcomes . As group , assays refer drug resistance assay . In resistance assay , survive tumor cell detect directly exclusion metabolism specific dye . Alternatively , since tumor cell proliferate , survival detect measurement DNA synthesis radiolabeled precursor incorporation demonstration clonogenic potential growth colony semi-solid culture medium . In several clinical study , assay useful detect drug resistance predict poor prognosis cancer patient . However , resistance assay detect sensitivity individual patient 's tumor cell specific drug . Therefore , new method determine drug-sensitivity tumor cell individual patient , thus , capable predict positive treatment outcome guide chemotherapy , would significant value . Recently , automate microculture kinetic ( MiCK ) assay measure drug induce apoptosis tumor cell developed1-4 . Apoptosis distinct mode cell death occur physiological condition yet induce malignant cell chemical physical factor include antitumor drugs5-7 . During last decade , recognize chemotherapeutic agent exert antitumor activity trigger apoptosis susceptible tumor cells8-17 . This imply MiCK assay apoptosis provide mechanism-based approach study effect cytotoxic agent tumor cell . Unlike `` resistance '' assay measure fraction cell survive drug exposure , MiCK assay measure fraction tumor cell kill chemotherapeutic agent via mechanism apoptosis . Therefore MiCK assay determines drug sensitivity , rather resistance . Recently MiCK assay show predict complete remission rate survival acute myeloid leukemia patient well clinical criterion did18-20 . In limited study , MiCK assay use direct chemotherapy leukemia patient 21 . The MiCK assay also use study drug-induced apoptosis solid tumor , include neuroblastoma colon adenocarcinoma cell lines22-23 . More recent data accumulate DiaTech demonstrate MiCK assay detect drug induce apoptosis primary culture tumor cell isolated patient ovarian carcinoma , gastric carcinoma , metastatic breast cancer high grade soft tissue sarcoma . The purpose study correlate result MICK assay short- long-term result treatment cancer patient evaluate role MiCK assay guide chemotherapy cancer patient .</detailed_description>
