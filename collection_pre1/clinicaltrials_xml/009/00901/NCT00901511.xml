	<detailed_description>Background : Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis ( PAP ) rare disorder characterize accumulation lipoproteinaceous material within alveolar space , lead respiratory failure . Whole lung lavage ( WLL ) current therapeutic option , may induce complete resolution disorder 30 % patient . Based PAP pathophysiology , pilot study deal administration rGM-CSF ( Sargramostim ) patient either s.c. aerosolized perform , hopeful results.Objectives . We design experimental , randomized parallel group , stratify accord previous treatment , open-label study look evaluation superiority combination WLL/inhaled GM-CSF v WLL alone PAP patient . The study also include side , observational section . The primary efficacy objective total resolution pulmonary involvement treat patient . The study include secondary efficacy objective well : avoidance disease recurrence , avoidance respiratory infection , investigation biomarkers predict disease outcome , effect treatment underlie pathophysiology PAP . Methods : PAP patient match enrollment criterion enter study . 1 ) If require first WLL , randomize receive WLL ( 1st level control group ) WLL/ follow inhaled GM-CSF , accord acute ( 12 week ) follow maintenance ( 6 month ) schedule ( 1st level treat group ) . 2 ) PAP patient require second WLL : ) 1st level control group subject randomize receive WLL alone ( 2nd level control group ) WLL/GM-CSF ( 2nd level treat group ) ; b ) 1st level treat group receive WLL/GM-CSF ( 1st level re-treated group ) . 3 ) PAP patient require 3rd WLL receive WLL/GM-CSF ( 2nd level re-treated group ) . 4 ) PAP patient require additional WLL , persistent lung abnormality receive course inhale GM-CSF ( Residual disease treat group ) . At scheduled time , PAP patient evaluate questionnaire , respiratory function test , CT-assisted lung profusion score , severity score , quality life form , clinical chemistry . Expected result : We plan identify best treatment schedule PAP patient . We able identify optimal sequence treatment ( i.e. , WLL + short-term inhale GM-CSF WLL + short-and long-term inhaled GM-CSF ) optimal treatment case recurrence .</detailed_description>
