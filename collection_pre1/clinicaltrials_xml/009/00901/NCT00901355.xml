	<brief_summary>Introduction : High blood pressure especially systolic hypertension common condition elderly consider major determinant cardiovascular ( CV ) morbidity mortality , also several age-related disease , frailty loss autonomy . Actually , association BP level morbidity mortality elderly person several co-morbidities remain controversial issue Objectives : The aim PARTAGE study ( Predictive value blood pressure arterial stiffness institutionalize aged population ) determine predictive value blood pressure ( BP ) arterial stiffness overall mortality , major cardiovascular event cognitive decline large population institutionalize subject age 80 . Methods : The population compose 1130 subject age 80 , live nursing home , include four french university hospital centre ( Nancy , Dijon , Paris , Toulouse ) two Italian ( Cesena , Verona ) . Subjects severe dementia low level autonomy exclude study During first visit , blood pressure measure use automatic monitor physician sit stand position ( clinical BP Orthostatic BP ) self measurement blood pressure 3 measurement , morning evening , 3 consecutive day ) . Arterial stiffness evaluate measure carotid-femoral carotid-radial pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) PulsePen® automatic device . Deaths cardiovascular event record follow-up 2 year . The hypothesis PARTAGE longitudinal study elderly frail individual multiple co-morbidities , CV risk could well evaluate combine self-measurements BP direct evaluation arterial stiffness less influenced mentioned disease co-morbidities .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim PARTAGE study ( Predictive value blood pressure arterial stiffness institutionalize aged population ) determine predictive value blood pressure ( BP ) arterial stiffness estimate pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) overall mortality , major CV event cognitive decline large population subject live nursing home age 80 . Method : Participants include age 80 year old , institutionalized sign informed consent . Persons exclude severe dementia ( Mini Mental Status Examination : MMSE &lt; 12 ) , low level autonomy ( Activity daily living : ADL≤2 ) guardianship `` measure legal protection '' . All geriatric assessment instrument arterial measure apply several trained medical research team ( geriatrician , cardiologist , psychologist ) present university hospital centre . All medical team receive standard operating procedure . All assessment perform nursing home . Clinical data collection During first visit nursing home , medical research team collect large amount information face-to-face interview patient 's medical record . Following information record participant case report form ( CRF ) : sociodemographic characteristic , educational level , medical history , chronic disease ( cardio vascular , central nervous system , respiratory ) , depressive symptom , history fall , co morbidity medication use . Additionally , clinical examination functional status , cognitive function , blood pressure arterial stiffness realize medical research team . - Comorbidities quantify use Charlson combine comorbidity index . - Functional status evaluate Katz Index independence ability activity daily live ( ADL ) ( bath , dress , go toilet , transfer bed chair , continence feeding ) . - Cognitive status assess use Mini-Mental-Status-Examination ( MMSE ) , global measurement cognitive function evaluate various dimension cognition ( memory , calculation , orientation space time , language , word recognition ) . Peripheral blood pressure measurement : Peripheral BP heart rate ( HR ) perform brachial artery level use validate automated oscillometric device Colson DM-H20 ( Dupont Médical , Frouard , France ) . Both clinical self-measurement blood pressure perform study . - Clinical BP measurement perform morning ( 8 noon ) , doctor nurse , patient 's room infirmary institute , 10 minute rest . All measurement repeat three time , interval 3 min leave arm sit position without replace cuff three measurement , accord specific recommendation European Society Hypertension . - Self-measurements BP perform follow rule 3 ( 3 measurement morning even 3 consecutive day ) accord protocol propose French society hypertension . Self-measurements perform subject her/himself room he/she live habitually . In case difficulty , measurement realize assistance nurse medical research team institution . Central blood pressure measurement Central BP value aortic pressure waveform obtain common carotid waveform use applanation tonometry . The PulsePen device ( DiaTecne srl , Milan , Italy ) , validate , easy use , high-fidelity tonometer use . Pulse wave velocity PulsePen device also use measure carotid-radial pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) reflect upper limb arterial stiffness carotid-femoral PWV correspond aortic stiffness . Follow-up data : Medical research team record every 3 month follow-up 2 year death follow cardiovascular event : stroke , transient ischemic attack , myocardial infarction , unstable angina , acute pulmonary oedema , aortic aneurysm rupture , peripheral arterial thromboembolism , venous thrombosis major cardiovascular event . Moreover , new assessment autonomy , ADL , cognitive function , MMSE , achieve cohort research team one year two year first visit .</detailed_description>
