	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate technical performance clinical handling coronary catheter include two imaging technique . The catheter evaluate performs near infrared spectroscopy ultrasound image coronary artery . Near infrared spectroscopy use identify lipid cholesterol deposit vessel wall ultrasound component provide structural information vessel . Combining multiple image technique single catheter reduce total number catheter require treatment overall duration cardiac catheterization . Both result may lead safe procedure .</brief_summary>
