	<brief_summary>Background : - Esophageal cancer sixth lead cause cancer death worldwide . Two primary cell type , squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma , account case . Of two , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) account 80 percent death esophageal cancer . Many case occur certain area define geographic boundary , include part Kenya . - Studies ESCC develop country ( United States ) suggest heavy tobacco alcohol use , poor diet , low socioeconomic status primary risk factor . Males African Americans also high risk . However , risk factor fully explain prevalence case several identified geographic area . - ESCC common cancer see Tenwek Hospital western Kenya , notable number patient 30 year age younger . Objectives : - To test feasibility new protocol recruiting visitor Tenwek Hospital volunteer general population study purpose . - To use new protocol obtain blood urine sample ESCC case Tenwek Hospital nonpatient volunteer . Eligibility : - Hospital patient volunteer live within 50 kilometer Tenwek Hospital western Kenya . Design : - All participant complete questionnaire provide blood urine sample test . - The questionnaire include question individual family medical history , live condition , lifestyle , habit , diet . - Blood urine sample collect participant questionnaire . - Biological sample ship United States test . - Treatment offer part study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Case-Control Study Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Western Kenya</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study assess feasibility complete first formal case-control study examine etiologic factor esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) Kenya conduct Western Kenya , high-risk area ESCC . Esophageal cancer cause 380,000 death per year rank sixth lead cause cancer death worldwide . Two primary cell type , squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma , account case . Although rate esophageal adenocarcinoma risen rapidly United States elsewhere , ESCC still account 80 % esophageal cancer case world . Many case occur high-risk area sharp geographic boundary within China , Iran , small region South America , South Africa , Kenya . Studies ESSC economically develop country , US , point smoking tobacco , heavy alcohol drinking , poor diet deficient fresh fruit vegetable , low socioeconomic status main etiologic factor . Other independent risk factor may include male African-American . Smoking tobacco heavy alcohol consumption explain incidence rate high-risk region habit less common less intensely practice high-risk area compare low risk area . Also , highrisk area incidence rate similar men woman despite difference rate tobacco smoke alcohol drinking . Therefore , important consider wide range etiologic factor explain high rate cancer population . Tenwek Hospital 300 bed mission hospital locate Bomet District , Rift Valley Province , approximately 200 mile Nairobi west Kenya . Tenwek serve primary health care facility approximately 400,000 people , become referral center broad population . ESCC common malignancy see Tenwek Hospital patient show unusual age distribution 10 % case le equal 30 year age . We conduct pilot case-control study ESCC Tenwek Hospital , recruit people live within 50 km hospital . Initial pilot test show neither hospital-visitor control general-population control practical control source . We plan test feasibility collect 50 hospital-based non-cancer patient control . We enroll 50 case 50 additional hospital-based non-cancer patient control test aspect protocol . We ship biological sample collect individual US test suitability intend assay . All subject interview use structured questionnaire ask provide biological sample include blood urine . Environmental risk factor ( include lifestyle , habit , diet ) assess questionnaire .</detailed_description>
