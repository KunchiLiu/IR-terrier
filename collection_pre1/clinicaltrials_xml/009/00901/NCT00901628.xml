	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether periarticular multimodal drug injection ( PMDI ) would provide additional benefit patient total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) contemporary pain control protocols use continuous femoral nerve block , intra-venous patient control analgesia ( IV-PCA ) preemptive oral medication . We hypothesize PMDI would reduce pain level consumption PCA acute pain rescuer would provide good functional recovery patient satisfaction . We also hypothesize incidence side effect complication PMDI would similar No-PMDI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The preemptive multimodal approach regard current standard pain management protocol . Recently , periarticular multimodal drug injection ( PMDI ) consider one effective important component multimodal approach . Because contemporary pain management protocol use regional anesthesia , continuous femoral nerve block ( FNB ) intravenous patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) prove significantly improve analgesic effect , little information whether PMDI would provide additional pain relief pain management protocol available . Also , safety high dose local anesthetic narcotic clarify , selective application consider patient expect show well analgesia certain patient relate factor predict additional pain relief effect PMDI . Thus , prospective double-blind randomize study conduct determine whether PMDI would provide additional benefit patient total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) contemporary pain control protocols use continuous femoral nerve block , IV-PCA preemptive oral medication term pain relief , consumption PCA acute pain rescuer , patient satisfaction , functional recovery , side effect complication .</detailed_description>
