	<detailed_description>The study consist four phase : screening , open-label , double-blind discontinuation phase . After screen ensure subject meet study criterion , individual enter open-label ( flexible-dose ) trial paroxetine-CR give dosage 62.5 mg period eight week . Paroxetine may substitute paroxetine-CR dosage 50 mg . Subjects may switch paroxetine-CR bioequivalent dose paroxetine due drug supply disruption switch back paroxetine-CR . Subjects allow switch paroxetine paroxetine-CR . Subjects start paroxetine first visit must remain paroxetine duration study . At discretion investigator , additional monitoring interim visit may need subject require switch paroxetine-CR paroxetine . Those individual fail respond adequately continue second phase ( double-blind portion ) study , participant continue either paroxetine-CR paroxetine , randomize either placebo lamotrigine flexible-dose design 400mg 10-week period . Subjects remain dose paroxetine-CR paroxetine take final visit first phase study ( Visit 5/Week 8 ) . The study medication discontinue follow final study visit ( Visit 11/Week 18 early termination visit ) . Paroxetine-CR paroxetine may continue dosage use study completion protocol , judgment investigator , subject show partial response treatment drug . The lamotrigine ( placebo ) dose decrease half one week discontinue . Subjects return two week post-study four week post study follow visit consist safety evaluation . In addition , MADRS CGI perform two-week post study follow visit . The visit four week post study may omit 3rd 4th week taper need . The decision restart lamotrigine time would also investigator , dosage lamotrigine would titrate first month per manufacturer 's clinical trial program . This necessary since subject discontinue drug follow Visit 11/Week 18 early termination visit order maintain blind conclusion subject 's participation study . Subjects discontinue paroxetine-CR dosage 25 mg/day high undergo gradual dose reduction 12.5 mg per week rather abrupt cessation .
