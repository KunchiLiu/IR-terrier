	<brief_summary>Hypothesis - Rotigaptide improve endothelial function context endothelial dysfunction . The line blood vessel ( endothelium ) react hormone blood stream cause blood vessel muscle relax ( vasodilatation ) allow blood flow . The nitric oxide prostacyclin pathway well documented process . However , evidence point existence third powerful relaxant call endothelium derive hyperpolarising factor ( EDHF ) identity mechanism action prove elusive . As well cause blood vessel relax blood flow , EDHF may involve endothelium signaling , trigger release specialise clot dissolve factor call tissue plasminogen activator ( PA ) . PA important ensure small clot , constantly form circulation , rapidly dissolve grow large enough cause heart attack stroke . Evidence point towards requirement 'gap junction ' mediation EDHF response . Gap junction specialise pore allow small molecule charge pas cell . They find endothelial cell underlie muscle blood vessel . A drug call Rotigaptide develop cause gap junction open . It safely administer healthy volunteer Phase II drug trial . By open gap junction investigator hypothesise could increase EDHF mediated activity vasodilatation . It represent useful tool examine role gap junction EDHF activity vivo . Previously investigator demonstrate rotigaptide contribute endothelial function healthy volunteer . The investigator wish examine effect rotigaptide condition endothelial dysfunction . By limit blood flow arm 20mins ability blood vessel vasodilate impair . By administer intraâˆ’arterial rotigaptide infusion investigator want assess functional preservation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND The endothelium play pivotal role control vascular tone responsible local release profibrinolytic factor . Nitric oxide ( NO ) , original endothelium-derived relaxing factor , prostacyclin ( PGI2 ) well characterise . The elucidation roles vascular physiology pathophysiology fundamental recent advance treatment prevention many cardiovascular disease . Whilst factor major importance , evidence point existence third powerful vasodilator call endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor ( EDHF ) . Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation - After blockade NO PGI2 , substantial degree endothelium-dependent vasodilatation still observe attributed EDHF . Despite almost two decade research debate , exact nature EDHF mechanism action remain unclear . Consistently , EDHF 's role vasodilator prominent small resistance artery responsible control systemic blood pressure local organ perfusion . As well involvement physiological process , alteration EDHF activity may contribute vascular effect myriad condition either cause , result , endothelial dysfunction . However , lack understanding EDHF preclude direct manipulation specific therapeutic target . Endogenous fibrinolysis - In addition function control vascular tone , evidence suggest EDHF may responsible endothelial release pro-fibrinolytic factor , tissue-type plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) . Thrombus formation dissolution continuous process vasculature regulate dynamic interaction pro-coagulant pro-fibrinolytic factor . Endogenous fibrinolysis determine relative balance acute local release t-PA endothelium subsequent inhibition plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( PAI-1 ) . In presence imbalance fibrinolytic system , subclinical microthrombi surface atherosclerotic plaque may propagate ultimately lead arterial occlusion tissue infarction . The mechanisms via t-PA release mediate incompletely understood . Bradykinin , endogenous endothelium-dependent vasodilator , cause endothelial release t-PA . However , Brown et al demonstrated inhibition prostacyclin nitric oxide synthesis diminish bradykinin mediate endothelial t-PA release human forearm . Therefore , suggest EDHF responsible endothelial release t-PA , date , hypothesis adequately address . Gap Junctions - Gap junction find point cell-cell contact form aqueous pore small hydrophilic molecule ionic charge may pass . Each gap junction comprise two hemichannels , connexons compose six connexin ( Cx ) subunits . Although connexon may compose mix connexin subtypes , Cx37 , Cx40 Cx43 particularly associate mammalian endothelium vascular smooth muscle . The case pivotal role gap junction EDHF phenomenon strengthen . Gap junction plaque abundant small resistance artery distribution proportional magnitude EDHF-mediated response . These topographical data extrapolate argue direct link gap junction EDHF . Furthermore , murine knockout model provide direct evidence role gap junction specific connexins control vascular tone . Potentiation Communication via Gap Junctions - Rotigaptide ( ZP-123 ) novel hexapeptide ( Ac-D-Tyr-D-Pro-D-Hyp-Gly-D-Ala-Gly-NH2 ) , originally develop antiarrythmic agent safely administer healthy human six day continuous infusion 20 mg ( 0.30 mmol ) per day Phase II clinical trial . It show promote electrical couple ventricular myocytes increase gap junction conductance potentially via alteration phosphorylation status Cx43 increase number gap junction ischaemic myocardium It potentiate gap junction-mediated dye transfer via Cx43 express HeLa cell via Cx26 Cx32 effect electrical conduction dye transfer via Cx37 Cx40 , major vascular connexins , yet assess . However , recently show Cx43 required mediation EDHF vasodilatation human subcutaneous resistance vessel . We recently demonstrate rotigaptide enhance endothelium-dependent independent forearm arterial vasodilatation healthy volunteer . However may role potentiate gap junction circumstance . In animal model myocardial infarction treat rotigaptide significantly reduce infarction size . Endothelial dysfunction central pathophysiology diabetes responsible vascular complication associate condition . In animal model diabetes reduced expression connexins demonstrate blunted response EDHF , suggest link endothelial dysfunction gap junction . Endothelial dysfunction mimic vivo brief period ischaemia , result reduce response endothelium-dependant vasodilator . In forearm arterial circulation , test hypothesis rotigaptide-induced enhancement communication via gap junction attenuate ischaemic endothelial dysfunction .</detailed_description>
