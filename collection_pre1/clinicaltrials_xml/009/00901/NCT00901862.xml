	<detailed_description>Migraine disease considerably affect individual , family society . [ 1-3 ] In spite recent advance symptomatic preventive treatment migraine , relative effectiveness many commonly use prophylactic medicine well establish . Most drug indirect effect force suspension restriction prescription patient certain pathology . This fact reduce clinic effectiveness . [ 4 ] The therapy pulse electromagnetic field ( PEF 's ) use therapeutic modality least 40 year . One well acknowledged us heal non-union fracture , [ 5 ] although medical condition also susceptible treat type therapy , like migraine [ 6 ] , Parkinson disease , [ 7 ] epilepsia , [ 8 ] among others . Nevertheless , publish study demonstrate effectiveness PEF 's handle migraine . These study carry small number patient , without control groups6 short period time [ 6 , 9 ] demonstrate suitable prophylactic effect . Therefore , placebo-controlled , double-blind , crossed clinical study carry order evaluate prophylactic effectiveness therapy PEF 's handle migraine . METHODOLOGY Patients : The subject select Clinic Headache hospital 2006 2007 . All patient include study age 18-55yrs fulfil diagnose criterion migraine without aura agreement International Headache Classification , 2004 . The study conduct accordance Good Clinical Practice guideline Declaration Helsinki ( 1996 ) . The protocol statement inform consent approve Institutional Review Board . All patient accept participate voluntarily sign informed consent . Patients cluster , medicine overuse , post-traumatic headache , sinusitis headache type , woman pregnant , become pregnant study lactating , patient prophylactic treatment migraine sign informed consent exclude study . Patients allow continue medication acute attack migraine ; consist administer 30 mg sublingual ketorolac every eight hour , case migraine . The investigator supply sealed code individual patient would open case emergency require knowledge treatment take . Study design : This double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled crossed trial . Participants satisfy inclusion criterion enter four week baseline run-in period verify frequency intensity attack , follow 3 month treatment PEF 's placebo , 1 week wash-out period treatment , crossover . Evaluation activity Cephalea : Subjects provide diary record frequency , duration intensity attack , well use analgesic whole study period . The intensity pain evaluate analogous scale pain , show highly profitable effective . The pain stratify scale zero ( pain ) ten ( intense pain subject undergone least one second ) . The diary use typical one , show high effectiveness require entrance per migraine . The patient classify responder one month receive therapy , reduction equal great 50 % frequency episodes migraine . Randomization follow : The sociodemographic characteristic pattern basal activity cephaleas determine patient . The 19 patient fulfil inclusion criterion allocate treatment accord computer generate randomization procedure 4 consecutive balance block two patient ( one active , one placebo ) . They randomize , simple way , two group exposition : real placebo one . Patients evaluated researcher third sixth month treatment . Along time , patient register diary frequency clinical characteristic episode cephaleas treatment . Exposition PFEs Placebo : The PEF 's directed wrist . The model use form bracelet call Quantum MH-2MR use , source power , alkaline battery 1.5 volt connect electronic circuit form two hybrid circuit magnetic oscillation control system generate frequency system . The power variable magnetic field generate equipment vary 0.64 1.4 Gaussian , whereas spectrum generate main fixed frequency go 0 240 Hertz , semi-fixed one go 241 360 Hertz random one go 361 170 Megahertz . The control system continuously order fixed generation magnetic signal frequency differ 0.1 Hertz region spectrum 0 240 Hertz . It also order semi-fixed generation ( fixed random portion ) frequencies 241 360 Hertz , well random generation ( external presence frequency detect ) frequency 261 170 MHz . The machine set verification functionality voltmeter every three month moment case expose water . This carry engineer contact patient participate clinical evaluation follow . The participant could feel machine work neither could mention group . The machine placebo identical machine actual operation phase study . The difference hybrid circuit crucial generation electromagnetic field remove . As subject could feel change , possibility subject knowledge machine provide therapy one . At moment researcher blind distinguish device active one . The patient carry device continuously , except risk contaminating water , bath . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure change baseline number peak severity migraine attack double-blind phase . The secondary outcome proportion patient respond treatment least 50 % reduction migraine attack relative baseline . Safety assess report adverse event . Statistical analysis : We use descriptive statistical , mean standard deviation . All statistical calculation perform use computer software SPSS version 13.0 Windows</detailed_description>
