	<brief_summary>Plerixafor , administer dose 240 ug/kg , potentiates effect granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) increase peripheral blood progenitor cell healthy volunteer cancer patient . Furthermore , cancer patient , cell collect via apheresis use Plerixafor G-CSF successfully transplant . In December 2008 , Plerixafor receive approval Food Drug administration use combination G-CSF aid mobilization progenitor cell apheresis . The propose study design support approval new indication change advertising Plerixafor . The route administration dosage level identical list package insert . Although Plerixafor approve patient Hodgkins Lymphoma , know theoretic increase risk use drug patient population . The study hypothesis study patient circulate CD34+ count &lt; 20 cells/ul 5 day mobilization G-CSF alone achieve &gt; equal 2 X 10 ( 6 ) CD34+ cells/kg within 3 day apheresis receive Plerixafor G-CSF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Plerixafor Rescue Poor Mobilizers Autologous Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , Phase 2 , open-label study . All patient diagnose non-hodgkins lymphoma , hodgkins disease multiple myeloma candidate autologous transplantation eligible enter study . The change standard care addition 240 ug/kg Plerixafor follow 5 day ( G-CSF ) mobilization . The result study provide numeric categorical estimate measurement safety efficacy Plerixafor . The primary efficacy endpoint , Treatment Success , binary response variable categorize whether patient able mobilize least 2 X 10 ( 6 ) CD34+ cells/kg within 3 day apheresis . The percentage patient achieve Treatment Success summarize . All AEs follow 30 day last apheresis first dose ablative chemotherapy , whichever occur first . All SAEs follow 6 month post-transplant relapse . All patient receive least one dose Plerixafor include summary AEs .</detailed_description>
