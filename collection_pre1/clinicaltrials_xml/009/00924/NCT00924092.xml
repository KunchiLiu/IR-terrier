	<brief_summary>Objectives : - To find maximum tolerate dose GI-6207 vaccine ( high dose cause unacceptable side effect ) , evaluate side effect . - To see GI-6207 effect patient tumor . - To learn vaccine cause immune response cancer . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old diagnose cancer respond standard treatment . Patients must allergic yeast yeast product . Design : - Initial physical examination , blood tissue sampling , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , skin test determine eligibility procedure . - Treatment GI-6027 seven 14-day cycle follow : - Vaccine administer day 1 , 15 , 29 , 43 , 57 , 71 , 85 . - Vaccine give four site around body : right left chest area armpit , right leave upper thigh pelvic region . ( These area drain part body contain large number lymph node . The lymph node contain immune cell may activate vaccine target cancer cell . ) - Clinic visit physical examination check vital sign , take additional blood urine sample , perform test need study . - After day 85 ( 3 month ) , patient continue receive vaccine monthly ( every 28 day ) long vaccine produce harmful effect side effect cancer either stable reducing . Patients well vaccine may continue receive long available .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Phase I Study Eval Safety Tolerability Vaccine ( GI-6207 ) Consisting Whole , Heat-killed Recombinant Saccharomyces Cerevisiae ( Yeast ) Genetically Modified Express CEA Protein Adults With Metastatic CEA-expressing ...</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) overexpressed multiple adenocarcinoma . Previous clinical study utilize CEA-based vaccine therapy demonstrate safety , T-cell immune response CEA , preliminary evidence clinical benefit . Preclinical study show Saccharomyces-CEA ( yeast-CEA ) induce strong immune response CEA well therapeutic antitumor response CEA-transgenic host . Previous ongoing clinical study utilize whole , heat-killed recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast genetically modify express mutate Ras ( GI-4000 ) hepatitis C ( GI-5005 ) proteins demonstrated vaccine vehicle well tolerate , product-related serious adverse event &gt; 200 treated subject . Objectives : Primary -To determine safety tolerability escalate dos heat-killed yeast-based vaccine target tumor express CEA . Secondary - To evaluate CD4 CD8 immunologic response measure increase CEA-specific T cell measure ELISPOT HLA-A2 , -A3 -A24 ( + ) patient , proliferation response CEA protein . - To evaluate evidence clinical benefit , progression-free survival , RECIST criterion , reduction serum marker , and/or reduction circulate tumor cell . Eligibility : ( dose escalation phase ) Must metastatic cancer CEA-positive ( either CEA serum level &gt; 5 ng/mL tumor stain positive CEA &gt; 20 % tumor block ) . Must complete disease progression least one prior line disease-appropriate therapy , candidate therapy proven efficacy disease . Must ECOG Performance Status 0 2 . Should autoimmune disease ; evidence immune dysfunction ; serious intercurrent medical illness ; No untreated brain metastasis ( local treatment brain metastasis within last 6 month ) Any hypersensitivity reaction yeast-based product . Eligibility : ( extension phase : 10 additional patient high tested dose/MTD ) Same dose escalation phase follow exception : - Patients must HLA-A2 , -A3 , -A24 ( + ) immunologic monitor - ECOG PS = 0 1 Design : This open label , phase I trial sequential cohort patient ( 3-6 patient per dose cohort ) dose escalation heat-killed GI-6207 vaccine ( see statistical analysis section ) . GI 6207 vaccine administer subcutaneously 4 site biweekly 7 visit ( day 1 , 15 , 29 , 43 , 57 , 71 , 85 ) , monthly patient meet off-study criterion . All patient give dose level complete 1 month on-study enrollment begin next dose level extension phase ( see statistical analysis section ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : A. Histologically confirm carcinoma NIH Laboratory Pathology show express CEA ( either CEA serum level &gt; 5 microg/L tumor stain positive CEA &gt; 20 % tumor block ) . B . Completed disease progression least one prior line diseaseappropriate therapy metastatic disease , candidate therapy proven efficacy disease . C. 18 year age great . D. Must metastatic disease measurable nonmeasurable evaluable ( e.g. , pleural effusion present bone scan ) . E. Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . F. ECOG performance status 0 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 50 ) . G. Serum creatinine less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance 24h urine collection great equal 60 mL/min . H. ALT AST less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal . I . Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal OR patient Gilbert syndrome , total bilirubin less equal 3.0 . J . Recovered completely reversible toxicity associate recent therapy . Typically 3 4 week patient recently receive cytotoxic therapy , except nitrosoureas mitomycin C 6 week need recovery . There minimum 2 week prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy and/or radiation . K. Hematological eligibility parameter ( within 16 day start therapy ) : Granulocyte count great equal 1,500/mm ( 3 ) Platelet count great equal 100,000/mm ( 3 ) L. Prior immune therapy ( e.g . relate vaccinia fowlpox vaccine antigenspecific peptide ) allow . M. Men woman must agree use effective birth control abstinence period 4 month last vaccination therapy . N. Patients prostate cancer must continue receive GnRH agonist therapy ( unless orchiectomy do ) . O . Patients must negative yeast allergy skin test . P. Patients must baseline pulse oximetry great 90 % room air . INCLUSION CRITERIA ( EXTENSION PHASE : 10 ADDITIONAL PATIENTS AT HIGHEST TESTED DOSE/MTD ) : Eligibility : Same dose escalation phase follow exception : Patients must HLAA2 , A3 , A24 positive immunologic monitoring . ECOG PS equal 0 1 . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A . Patients evidence immune dysfunction list . Human immunodeficiency virus positivity due potential decrease immune response vaccine . Active autoimmune disease require treatment history autoimmune disease might stimulate vaccine treatment . This requirement due potential risk exacerbate autoimmunity . Patients endocrine autoimmune disease control replacement therapy , include thyroid disease adrenal disease ; vitiligo , may enrol . Concurrent use systemic steroid , except physiologic dos systemic steroid replacement local ( topical , nasal , inhale ) steroid use . Limited dos systemic steroid prevent IV contrast , allergic reaction , anaphylaxis ( patient know contrast allergy ) allow . B . History allergy untoward reaction yeastbased product ( hypersensitivity yeastbased product exclude ) . C. Pregnant breastfeed woman . E. Serious intercurrent medical illness would interfere ability patient carry treatment program , include , limited , inflammatory bowel disease , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , active diverticulitis . F. Untreated brain metastasis ( local treatment brain metastasis within last 6 month ) due poor prognosis patient difficulty ascertain cause neurologic toxicity . G. Concurrent chemotherapy . An exception allow patient extension phase breast cancer receive trastuzumab continue therapy trastuzumab receive vaccine treatment . K. Chronic hepatitis infection , include B C , potential immune impairment . L. Patients require continuous tricyclic antidepressant therapy exclude due interference yeast skin test create false negative test result .</criteria>
