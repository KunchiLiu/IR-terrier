	<brief_summary>BL22 type protein scientist create interact certain cancer cell . Experiments show BL22 bind cancer cell particular kind protein ( call CD22 ) surface , kill cell . CD22 present certain type hairy cell leukemia ( HCL ) cancer cell , researcher work treatment use BL22 related protein interact kill kind cancer cell . The primary purpose study provide access treatment BL22 patient HCL order determine response treatment . In addition , study assess potential side effect BL22 examine patient respond good others treatment BL22 related therapy . This study include 21 25 adult diagnose form HCL respond well standard treatment surgery , chemotherapy , radiation therapy . These adult also receive anti-CD22 therapy , potentially include treatment BL22 , develop immunity resistance treatment . Prior study , patient undergo 1- 2-week screening period assess eligibility treatment . Eligible patient participate study 16 cycle treatment , cycle last approximately 4 week . For cycle , patient receive 1 prescribed dose BL22 every day total 3 dos per cycle , assess every cycle evaluate success treatment . During evaluation visit , patient require brief physical examination , give blood urine sample test , undergo test need check heart kidney function ass state leukemia . Patients agree give additional blood , urine , bone marrow sample future research purpose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retreatment Protocol BL22 Immunotherapy Relapsed Refractory Hairy Cell Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : BL22 , also call CAT-3888 RFB4 ( dsFv ) -PE38 , recombinant immunotoxin contain Fv fragment anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody truncate Pseudomonas exotoxin ( PE ) . In Phase 1 2 trial patient chemoresistant hairy cell leukemia ( HCL ) , BL22 show 47-61 % complete remission ( CR ) rate 12 % HCL patient completely reversible hemolytic uremic syndrome ( HUS ) . A mutant BL22 , term CAT-8015 HA22 , differ 3 amino acid higher bind affinity CD22 compare BL22 ( 15-fold great ) . CAT-8015 currently undergo Phase 1 test HCL disease . HCL patient previously receive recombinant anti-CD22 immunotoxin ( BL22 , CAT-8015 , LMB-2 ) may benefit additional BL22 administration . Objectives : The primary objective provide access BL22 HCL patient previously receive BL22 , CAT-8015 , LMB-2 , ineligible CAT-8015 , may benefit BL22 . The primary outcome response treatment . Secondary objective : - Determine immunogenicity safety profile BL22 patient prior immunotoxin , use aspirin/enoxaparin prevent HUS . - To correlate response ex vivo sensitivity HCL cell , obtain blood without apheresis , BL22 recombinant anti-CD22 immunotoxins CAT-8015 , tumor marker . - To correlate neutralizing antibody number cycle BL22 , type number prior systemic therapy , time since prior purine analog . - To correlate CR bone marrow biopsy improvement bone marrow assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) spine . Eligibility : Patient must receive prior recombinant anti-CD22 immunotoxin ( i.e . BL22 , CAT-8015 , LMB-2 treatment ) ineligible CAT-8015 . HCL cytopenia , high malignant count symptomatic splenomegaly . Patients must least 2 prior systemic therapy . There must least 2 prior course purine analog , 1 response course last &lt; 2 year , patient unacceptable toxicity purine analog . Design : This single institution , expand access protocol accrue 21-25 patient . Patients administer BL22 30 microg/kg every day 3 dos ( QOD times 3 ) per 4-week cycle ( least 26 day ) maximum 16 cycle . Patients CR may receive 2 cycle without minimal residual disease ( MRD ) , 4 cycle CR MRD , 16 cycle total . No retreatment high level neutralize antibody progressive disease . Patients treatment relapse great 2 month CR partial response may retreat eligibility criterion still meet . If HUS , accrual study suspend discussion FDA .</detailed_description>

There must least 2 prior course purine analog , 1 response course last less 2 year , patient unacceptable toxicity purine analog . Patient must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 , unless due potentially reversible active uncontrolled infection . Patient must great equal 18 year old . Patient understand give inform consent . Patient must adequate liver renal function , define follow criterion : 1 . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less equal 2.5times upper limit normal . 2 . Albumin great equal 3.0 g/dL . 3 . Total bilirubin less equal 2.2 mg/dL . 4 . Creatinine le equal 1.4 mg/dL creatinine clearance great equal 50 mL/min . Patient must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients pregnant nursing . A negative pregnancy test ( urine serum ) must document within one week prior start BL22 woman childbearing potential . Patient develop antibody titer neutralize great 75 % activity 1 microg/mL BL22 use bioassay . Patients systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy , immunotherapy , recombinant antiCD22 immunotoxin ( ie , CAT8015 , BL22 , LMB2 ) systemic steroid ( exception stable dose Prednisone less equal 20 mg/day ) treatment within 4 week enrollment . Patients receive limited number dos ( less 5 ) steroid nontreatment reason ( eg , allergy prophylaxis connect medical test ) may receive steroid within one week enrollment may evidence disease response steroid . Subjects receive steroid condition ( e.g. , autoimmune disorder ) eligible , long increase dose change steroid type within 1 week treatment . Subjects use chronic steroid must wait 4 week start trial . Patient monoclonal antibody therapy ( exception BL22 CAT8015 LMB2 ) within 4 week enrollment . Patient receive investigational agent . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients discontinue CAT8015 BL22 study due toxicity doselimiting toxicity . Dose limit toxicity CAT8015</criteria>
