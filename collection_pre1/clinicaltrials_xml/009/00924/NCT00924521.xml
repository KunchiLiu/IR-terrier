	<brief_summary>Whole grain intake beneficially affect body weight , body fat glucose metabolism , investigator ' previous work show high whole grain intake significantly reduce body fat abdominal region measure dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) compare refine grain intake . Additional research need regard mechanism whole grain may affect visceral adiposity adipokines , associate risk insulin resistance type 2 diabetes . Therefore propose study aim address issue addition , include exploratory work adipocytes cell culture evaluate effect whole grain adipocyte function . Hypothesis : There great reduction visceral adiposity , indicator insulin resistance ( HOMA score ) , improvement inflammatory status improvement adipokine level six week weight stable period six week weight loss subject consume 6-9 serving compare 0 serving whole grain per day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Grains Reduce Adiposity Improve Nutrition Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Including whole grain part heart-healthy diet show beneficial decreasing body weight body fat . The beneficial effect whole grain body weight may explain large volume relatively low energy density whole grain food thus lead increase satiation . Reducing visceral fat particular importance visceral adiposity associate increase risk metabolic diseases cardiovascular disease . The propose study randomize , 2-parallel arm control feeding study . Subjects fed one two weight maintenance diet ( refine grain whole grain ) 6 week , follow 6 week control weight loss period subject fed diet , reduce calorie level , design elicit weight loss ( ~2 lb per week ) . Diets group nutrient profile ( percent calorie fat , protein , carbohydrate , etc . ) ; however , whole grain ( WG ) group substitute whole grain refine grain grain intake ( bread , tortilla , cereal , etc. ) . The WG group expect take 6-9 serving whole grain per day diet . Plasma endpoint measure baseline end 6-week diet period . Blood sample also take mid-point period hold analysis deem appropriate initial data review . Endo-PAT conduct baseline end diet period well DEXA MRI testing .</detailed_description>
