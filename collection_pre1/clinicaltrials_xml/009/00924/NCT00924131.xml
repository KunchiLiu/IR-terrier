	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers greatly interested know long-term effect various treatment cancer Hodgkin 's disease , particularly live 20 30 year treatment . - Patients treat National Institutes Health ( NIH ) may undergo different treatment long-term information need . Objectives : - To examine body system long-term survivor Hodgkin 's disease see long- term consequence treatment Hodgkin 's disease . - To learn long-term effect cancer treatment . Eligibility : - Survivors Hodgkin 's disease previously treat NIH . - Participants must least 18 year age . Design : - Participants need sign consent form allow researcher obtain documentation medical history , include prior treatment Hodgkin 's disease prior NIH treatment , include protocol number , applicable : - Pertinent medical record , pathology report , radiographic image study review . - Primary care physician 's name , address , contact information also require . - Evaluations assessment period : - Complete physical examination . - Laboratory study blood , urine , stool sample . - Radiologic evaluation , include computerize tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan participant mammograms female . - Cardiac evaluation , vascular study , pulmonary study measure heart lung function , digestive test measure stomach intestinal function . - Neurocognitive testing measure brain function . - Optional skin biopsy . - Participants ask complete questionnaire assess current quality life daily live skill .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Late Treatment Effects Long-Term Survivors Hodgkin 's Disease Previously Treated NIH : A Multi-Institutional Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Nearly 75 % Hodgkin 's Disease ( HD ) patient cure disease chemotherapy radiotherapy , result grow number long-term survivor . Adverse effect HD treatment , include second malignancy cardiovascular disease , affect survival quality life . Minimizing late toxicity become major emphasis current investigational regimen . Better characterization long-term toxicity quality life ( QOL ) therapy HD ability determine late toxicity arise give modality may allow ability shape future regimens late toxicity minimize . OBJECTIVES : Primary objective : To describe cardiac , pulmonary , vascular function patient previously treat HD NIH correlate information treatment receive . - To measure cardiac function abnormality correlate finding treatment receive . - To measure pulmonary function pulmonary function test survivor HD correlate finding treatment receive . - To measure vascular function survivor HD correlate finding treatment receive . Secondary Objectives : To determine elevate plasma TGF level correlate presence late radiation fibrosis long-term survivor HD . To evaluate late quality life ( QOL ) long-term survivor HD correlate QOL treatment receive . To evaluate describe additional exploratory measure organ function patient previously treat HD NIH correlate information treatment receive . - Heart rate variability - Pulmonary fibrosis . - Intestinal function . - Neurocognitive function . To evaluate correlation exploratory functional assay , biomarkers , single nucleotide polymorphisms presence late chemotherapy radiation toxicity long-term HD survivor . ELIGIBILITY : Survivors HD previously treat NIH . DESIGN : This single point time follow-up evaluation long-term HD survivor , previously treat NIH . Patients evaluate late toxicity multiple organ system use image modality , laboratory test , functional assay , investigational study .</detailed_description>
