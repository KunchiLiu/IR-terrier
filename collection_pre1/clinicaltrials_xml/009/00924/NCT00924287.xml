	<brief_summary>Background : - Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ( Her-2 ) gene find normal cell cancer cell . Extra copy gene ( overexpression ) cause many Her-2 protein ( receptor ) appear cell surface cause tumor grow . - An experimental procedure develop treat patient cancer use blood cell find tumor bloodstream . The cell genetically modify use anti-Her-2 gene type virus . The modified cell ( anti-Her-2 cell ) grow laboratory give back patient try decrease size tumor . This call gene therapy . Objectives : - To determine whether advanced cancer overexpress Her-2 treat effectively lymphocytes ( white blood cell ) genetically engineer contain anti-Her-2 protein . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old metastatic cancer ( cancer spread beyond original site ) standard treatment effective . - Patient 's tumor overexpresses Her-2 . Design : - Workup scan , x-rays test . - Leukapheresis obtain cell prepare anti-Her-2 cell later infusion . - 1 week chemotherapy prepare immune system receive anti-Her-2 cell . - Infusion anti-Her-2 cell , follow interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) treatment . The cell give infusion vein . IL-2 give 15-minute infusion vein every 8 hour maximum 15 dos . - Periodic follow-up clinic visit hospital discharge physical examination , review treatment side effect , laboratory test scan every 1 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - We construct single retroviral vector contain chimeric T cell receptor ( CAR ) recognize Her-2 tumor antigen , use mediate genetic transfer CAR high efficiency ( great 30 % ) without need perform selection . - In co-cultures Her-2 positive tumor , anti-Her-2 CAR transduce T cell secrete significant amount interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) ( Her-2 high specificity ) . Objectives : Primary objective : - To evaluate safety administration anti-Her-2 -CAR engineer peripheral blood lymphocytes patient receive non-myeloablative condition regimen aldesleukin . - Determine administration anti-Her-2 -CAR engineer peripheral blood lymphocyte aldesleukin patient follow nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic cancer express Her-2 antigen . Secondary objective : - Determine vivo survival CAR gene-engineered cell . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old must - metastatic cancer whose tumor express Her-2 antigen ; - previously receive non-responder recur standard care metastatic disease ; Patients may : - contraindication high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : - Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain leukapheresis ( approximately 5 time 10^9 cell ) culture presence anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) aldesleukin order stimulate T-cell growth . - Transduction initiated exposure approximately 10^8 5 time 10^8 cell retroviral vector supernatant contain anti-Her-2 CAR gene . - Patients receive nonmyeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow intravenous ( IV ) infusion ex vivo tumor reactive , CAR genetransduced PBMC plus IV aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg q8h maximum 15 dos ) . - Patients undergo complete evaluation tumor physical examination , compute tomography ( CT ) chest , abdomen pelvis clinical laboratory evaluation four six week treatment . If patient stable disease ( SD ) tumor shrinkage , repeat complete evaluation perform every 1-3 month . After first year , patient continue respond continue follow evaluation every 3-4 month study criterion meet . - The study conduct use Phase I/II optimal design . The protocol proceed phase 1 dose escalation design , three cohort . Should single patient experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) particular dose level , three patient would treat dose confirm great 1/6 patient DLT prior proceed next high level . If level 2 DLTs 3-6 patient identify , three additional patient accrue next-lowest dose , total 6 , order characterize safety maximum tolerate dose prior start phase II portion . If dose limit toxicity occur first cohort , cohort expand 6 patient . If 2 DLTs encounter cohort , study terminate . - Once maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine , study would proceed phase II portion . Patients enter two cohort base histology : cohort 1 include patient metastatic breast cancer , cohort 2 include patient type metastatic cancer express Her-2 . - For 2 stratum evaluate , study conduct use phase II optimal design initially 21 evaluable patient enrol . For two arm trial , 0 1 21 patient experience clinical response , patient enrol 2 first 21 evaluable patient enrol clinical response , accrual continue total 41 evaluable patient enrol stratum . - The objective determine combination high dose aldesleukin , lymphocyte deplete chemotherapy , anti-Her-2 CAR-gene engineer lymphocyte able associated clinical response rate rule 5 % ( p0=0.05 ) favor modest 20 % partial response ( PR ) + complete response ( CR ) rate ( p1=0.20 ) .</detailed_description>
