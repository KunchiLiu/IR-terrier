	<brief_summary>Background : - Prostate cancer difficult see image study X-rays , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan conventional positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . - An experimental radioactive tracer call 11C-acetate accumulates prostate tumor cell may help find prostate cancer accurately image method . Objectives : - To determine accuracy prostate tumor image use tracer 11C-acetate . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old undergoing surgery localize prostate cancer National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center . Design : - Patients positron emission tomography ( PET scan ) . For test , intravenous ( IV ) line place patient 's arm patient lie table inside donut shape scanner . ( 11 ) C-acetate injected vein catheter image low pelvis abdomen obtain 30 minute . - Patients endorectal coil MRI scan . For test , tube place rectum , behind prostate , increase amount signal receive magnetic resonance ( MR ) unit . Other coil may wrap around pelvis improve quality scan . The patient lie scan table 75 90 minute image obtain . During scan , contrast agent call gadolinium inject intravenous ( IV ) line brighten image .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Accurate localization prostate cancer ( PC ) important develop target minimally invasive therapy . While T2 weight imaging , dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) imaging , diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) , magnetic resonance ( MR ) spectroscopy image perform 3T useful technique localize prostate cancer , limitation sensitivity specificity . - Positron emission tomography ( PET ) radiopharmaceutical sensitive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) detection cancer ; however , resolution PET inferior MRI . Therefore , combine PET/MR approach might desirable . - We propose evaluate utility PET radiopharmaceutical , ( 11C ) acetate ( ( 11C ) AC ) detection PC within prostate compare distribution T2 weight imaging , dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) imaging , diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) , MR spectroscopy image preform 3T . - Unlike fludeoxyglucose F18 ( 18F ) FDG , routinely use PET radiopharmaceutical excrete urinary system accumulate bladder , limit utility pelvic imaging , ( 11C ) AC low physiologic distribution pelvis . Several study involve small number patient demonstrate ( 11C ) AC PET image localize pelvic node involve prostate cancer ( PC ) . - Dynamic ( 11C ) AC PET/CT examination perform patient biopsy proven prostate cancer ( estimate enrollment 40 ) also undergo prostate/pelvic 3T endorectal coil MR/magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( MRSI ) follow surgical resection ( +/- pelvic lymphadenectomy ) . - Histological comparison PET/CT MRI result conduct . This study ( 11C ) AC PC permit direct comparison MR/MRSI ( 11C ) AC PET/CT detection prostate cancer within prostate . Objectives : Primary Objective : - To compare biodistribution ( 11C ) acetate ( ( 11C ) AC ) PET/CT image tumor non-tumorous region prostate patient know prostate cancer . Secondary Objective : - To examine diagnostic accuracy standardize uptake value ( SUV ) ( 11C ) AC obtain use PET/CT image detect region ( sextant ) -specific malignancy use receiver operate curve ( ROC ) . - To examine whether pelvic biodistribution ( 11C ) AC PET/CT image predicts sextant-specific malignancy well T2 weight imaging , dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) imaging , diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) , MR spectroscopy ( MRS ) image perform 3T . - To evaluate potential physiological effect ( 11C ) AC - To correlate intensity ( 11C ) AC uptake histopathologic Gleason Grade - Tabulate incidence extraprostatic lesion accumulate ( 11C ) AC PET/CT detection suspicious extraprostatic disease compare suspicious lesion ( 11C ) AC PET/CT standard care diagnostic imaging modality , additional biopsy result , clinical follow-up perform discretion refer physician . Eligibility : - Participants must schedule undergo standard care prostatectomy presume localized prostate cancer National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center . - Recent ( within 12 month study entry ) biopsy indicate presence adenocarcinoma prostate gland - Participant must 18 year old - Serum creatinine within 1 week prior MR image less equal 1.8mg/dl AND epidermal growth factor receptor ( eGFR ) must great 30 ml/min/1.73m^2 - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance score 0 1 - Participants may receive androgen deprivation therapy pelvic radiation therapy Design : - Participants prostate cancer schedule prostatectomy NIH Clinical Center undergo 30-minute dynamic ( 11C ) AC PET/CT imaging , endorectal coil/pelvic T2 weight , DCE , DWI , MRS image perform 3T . - We accrue 40 participant study .</detailed_description>
