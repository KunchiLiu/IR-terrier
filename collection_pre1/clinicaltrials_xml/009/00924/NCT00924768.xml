	<brief_summary>The purpose Phase 1 research study identify dose inhale endotoxin safe ( cause prolong cough , shortness breath problem ) , cause change sputum cell sample scientist measure . The investigator also interested see exposure endotoxin decrease body 's natural ability clear mucus lung .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Inhalation 20,000 EU CCRE Mucociliary Clearance ( MCC ) Otherwise Healthy Individuals Who Are Current Cigarette Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine range neutrophil response ( influx PMNs airway determine sputum ) inhalation CCRE ( 20,000 EU ) , show previous study healthy , nonsmoking volunteer well limited number otherwise healthy smoker well tolerate . This dose induces measurable increase neutrophil content induce sputum employ screen large population susceptibility inflammatory effect inhale endotoxin . Limitations understand action inflammatory stimuli airway function likely due fact functional assessment dynamic airway response /in vivo/ generally limit base spirometry examination airway sample assessment cell mediator content . Slowing mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) , key component airway defense , induced inflammation almost certainly contribute mucus plug decreased clearance inhale irritant . Measures mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) , inhalation radiolabeled particle label airway surface liquid , suggest clearance secretion impair mild degree smoker severely patient hospitalize acute exacerbation .</detailed_description>
