	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Physical activity may help lessen fatigue caused cancer patient receive chemotherapy . It yet know whether home-based walk resistance-band exercise program effective lessening fatigue . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study well exercise work lessen fatigue cause cancer patient undergo chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Lessening Fatigue Caused Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy home-based walk progressive-resistance exercise program reduce cancer-related fatigue ( CRF ) patient undergo chemotherapy . Secondary - Determine home-based walk progressive-resistance exercise program improve aerobic capacity patient . - Determine home-based walk progressive-resistance exercise program improve strength patient . - Determine home-based walk progressive-resistance exercise program improve quality life patient . Supplemental - To determine home-based walk progressive resistance exercise program improve inflammatory profile ( IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-1b , IFN-y , &amp; TNFr1 ) among 300 patient receive chemotherapy . - To provide initial examination whether change IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-1b , IFN-y , &amp; TNFr1 mediate relationship physical exercise CRF . - To determine home-based walk progressive resistance exercise program increase total energy expenditure kcal/kg/min assess use actigraphy among 300 patient receive chemotherapy . - To determine home-based walk progressive resistance exercise program increase two specific component exercise dose : 1 ) duration physical activity measure total minute non-sedentary activity , 2 ) intensity physical activity measure minute sedentary , low , moderate vigorous activity use objective actigraphy assessment . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate site , chemotherapy course length ( 2 week vs 3 week ) , gender , degree fatigue report study assessment questionnaire ( ≤ 5 v &gt; 5 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 intervention arm . - Arm I : Patients receive standard chemotherapy . - Arm II : Patients receive home-based walk kit comprise Exercise Cancer Patients Manual , pedometer , therapeutic resistance band . Patients undergo moderately intense aerobic exercise ( walk ) monitor pedometer , low moderately intense progressive-resistance exercise use therapeutic resistance band 6 week . Patients also receive standard chemotherapy . Patients arm undergo assessment aerobic capacity strength 6-minute walk test handgrip dynamometry baseline day 41 . They also fast blood draw wear actigraph one week baseline week 6 . Patients complete Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue -Cognitive Subscales , Brief Fatigue Inventory , Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory , Center Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale State Trait Anxiety Inventory , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory , Profile Mood States , Aerobic Center Longitudinal Study Physical Activity , Symptom Inventory questionnaire baseline day 41 keep daily exercise diary study intervention .</detailed_description>
