	<detailed_description>Introduction : Cardiac output key physiological parameter . Unfortunately , often difficult measure without use invasive technique associate risk . The pulmonary artery catheter , since introduction , consider gold standard measurement cardiac output man . Unfortunately , pulmonary artery catheter associate serious complications.1,2 Thoracic electrical bio-impedance ( TEB ) suggest possible non-invasive technique measurement cardiac output . The accuracy reliability TEB evaluate multiple time study demonstrate good correlation thermodilution3-7 others poor correlation.6,8-15 . TEB reliable patient cardiopulmonary bypass8,9 , kidney transplants11 , congestive heart failure16 , pulmonary edema14 , sepsis12 , pregnancy15 , abdominal surgery11,17 , critical illness13,14 . One limitation TEB signal noise ratio . Commonly TEB system use alternate current ( 1 - 4 20-100 Khz ) apply skin little control percentage current passing vascular structure chest . Changes electrical impedance lung respiration change percentage total current passing blood contain structure . Finally , treat blood contain structure chest single impedance measure , allow separation signal various component . A technique stabilize percentage current deliver target structure record electrical impedance signal directly target structure improve accuracy reliability impedance base measurement cardiac output . The Endotracheal Cardiac Output Monitor ( ECOM ) system record voltage produce current ( 2 100 Khz ) deliver tracheal mucosa electrode endotracheal tube . The proximity ascend aorta trachea allow design device optimize current delivery signal record impedance change ascend aorta . This study test accuracy efficacy ECOM system anesthetize patient . Significance : A simple , inexpensive , continuous , non-invasive , accurate , reproducible method measure cardiac output patient would reduce need pulmonary artery catheter measurement cardiac output . Such technique would allow rapid diagnosis treatment hemodynamic instability critically ill patient . The maintenance cardiac output essential prevention end organ injury result morbidity mortality . A technique accurately measure cardiac output would greatly assist management critically ill patient . Methods : We propose compare measurement cardiac output make Conmed ECOM 6-3D endotracheal tube make pulmonary artery catheter use . We correlation study cardiac output perform use standard thermodilution technique patient , normal course clinical care , cardiac output measure thermodilution technique . We compare cardiac output measure impedance cardiography transit time measurement . These correlation study do O.R . intensive care unit patient scheduled cardiac surgery routinely cardiac output measurement use standard thermodilution method . Many different algorithm develop conversion thoracic impedance signal calculation cardiac output include Kubicek18 , Bernstein-Sramek19 , Shmulewitz20 , adaptive algorithms.20 Each algorithm require sort empirically derive factor convert measurement resistance measurement volume . The ECOM system use adaptive multi-parameter algorithm allow reduction subject variability . We derive empiric fit porcine model do patient . This study therefore divide two component . The first data collection 15 patient provide data empiric fit ECOM system true cardiac output . The second set 300 patient test group algorithm . 1 . General Study Design Two Component Study : Two component study . The first section 15 patient study provide data empiric fit ECOM signal true cardiac output . The second section 300 patient study provide test data validation algorithm . Cardiac Output Measurements : Cardiac output measure impedance device compare measurement thermodilution catheter . The primary comparison ECOM measurements thermodilution measurement . Safety Data : No complication identify ECOM system use patient studied date . Despite safety profile , would like identify potential problem ECOM tube use . These problem could potentially include tracheal stenosis , laryngeal injury , vocal cord injury , change voice . We look complication clinical history follow . We also include extensive post operative interview look airway injury . 2 . Methods Data Analysis Primary outcome comparison correlation thermodilution cardiac output ECOM impedance measurement . Both Linear regression Bland-Altman statistic thermodilution cardiac output measurement versus impedance cardiography perform . Significance p &lt; 0.05 . Power Calculations : A sample size 15 patient give u 90 % power show correlation R2 0.75 . In ECOM porcine study R2 0.77 0.84 . The 300 patient second section give u sufficient patient variability ( large , small , male , female , young , old , aortic atherosclerosis , aortic regurgitation ) ass technique across wide spectrum patient . 3 . Subject Selection 1. Who Why : Patients schedule cardiac surgery use extracorporeal circulation median sternotomy consent . As part routine care cardiac surgery , patient intubate pulmonary artery catheter place . The measurement propose study therefore add little additional risk . Study patient intubate endotracheal tube allow endotracheal electrode measurement ( ECOM 6-3D ) . Thermodilution cardiac output routinely measure allow correlation ECOM thermodilution cardiac output measurement minimal additional risk . 2 . Total Number/Number per Group Three hundred ( 300 ) patient undergo cardiac surgery median sternotomy study . 4 . Subject Recruitment 1 ) Source : Patients schedule cardiac surgery San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center ( VAMC ) hospital . 2 ) Initial Contact Method : Prospective subject approach study physician consent obtain anesthesia pre-operative ( preop ) clinic prior admission hospital , hospital , patient already in-patient . Subjects approach study physician obtain consent . 5 . Consent Process Documentation All consent obtain study physician explain risks patient . The VA population use . No minor non-English speaker include . No patient mentally incompetent give consent include . Only sign , write , witness , informed consent use . 6 . Procedures 1 ) Study Procedures The patient undergo routine monitor placement surgery . Only patient would pulmonary artery catheter place surgery include . The following exception standard anesthetic preparation , induction , maintenance , emergence make . 1 . Extra ECG electrode patch place . 2 . The endotracheal tube 7 silver dope plastic electrode ( Conmed ECOM Tube ) . 3 . Pulse oximetry measure record use finger , nose , forehead pulse oximetry measurement continuously . Pulse oximetry reading compare three site compare cardiac output measurement . The percentage time signal obtain three site calculate . The accuracy pulse oximetry measurement compare routinely draw blood saturation measurement . Pulse oximetry require surgery . This addition record value obtain routine care . If difference brand sensor type , result may report . 4 . Cardiac output measure iced-thermodilution impedance cardiography . All personnel involve study understand management patient do use thermodilution derive cardiac output measurement . The ECOM endotracheal cardiac output measurement research purpose use management patient . 5 . ECOM Impedance cardiography measure ICU routine thermodilution cardiac output measurement make . Endotracheal impedance measurement ( ECOM ) continue tracheal extubation . Correlation thermodilution measurement stop either endotracheal tube thermodilution catheter remove ( post op day 0 routinely ) . 6 . The patient interview medical record review adverse outcome study . Interviews occur prior hospital discharge , one month post discharge , yearly thereafter . 7 . The study conduct data collect research team . 2 ) Time : The study perform surgery ICU stay . It delay surgery 5 minute . Placement electrode patch rapid . The endotracheal electrode attach endotracheal tube placement tube routine . Recording cardiac output impedance data delay surgery . Placement removal aortic flow probe rapid may delay surgery minute . Data collect ICU correlation thermodilution impedance data , since transit time data collect outside operating room . ICU data delay ICU hospital discharge . 3 ) Study Site : All study perform VAMC either operating room ICU . 7 . Risks/Discomforts 1 . The extra ECG electrode patch minimal risk .
