	<brief_summary>Background : Neurofibromatosis Type 1 ( NF1 ) genetic disorder patient increase risk develop tumor ( usually non-cancerous ) central peripheral nervous system . The disease affect essentially every organ system . The natural course NFI time poorly understood . For patient treatment option surgery . A good understanding NF1 may helpful design future treatment study . Objectives : To evaluate people NF1 10 year order well understand natural history disease . To characterize patient population examine NFI affect patient quality life function . Eligibility : Children , adolescent , adult NF1 . Design : Participants comprehensive baseline evaluation include genetic testing , tumor imaging , pain quality-of-life assessment , neuropsychological , motor endocrine evaluation . Patients monitor every 6 month every 3 year , depend individual finding baseline study . Tests may include follow , appropriate : - Medical history , physical examination blood test . - Whole body face photography monitor visible deformity . - Neuropsychological testing , quality-of-life evaluation , motor function test , endocrinologic evaluation , heart lung function test , hear test , bone density scan bone evaluation . - MRI PET scan detect assess plexiform neurofibroma ( tumor arise nerve cause serious problem ) , paraspinal neurofibroma ( tumor arise nerve around spine cause problem compress spinal cord ) , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ( type cancer arise peripheral nerve involve sheath cover nerve ) . - Eye exam , MRI scan PET scan evaluate optic pathway glioma ( tumor arise vision nerve brain area vision ) chemical within tumor brain . - Eye exam photograph evaluate development Lisch nodule ( non-cancerous tumor eye ) . - Photographs dermal neurofibroma ( tumor skin ) , cafe-au-lait spot ( dark pigment area skin often first sign NF1 ) skin problem . - Pain evaluation monitor different type pain patient experience , cause pain , often pain occurs , effect pain quality life , pain medication alternative treatment , acupuncture , effective ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Study Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Neurofibromatosis Type 1 ( NF1 ) autosomal dominant , progressive genetic disorder characterize diverse clinical manifestation . Patients NF1 increase risk develop tumor central peripheral nervous system include plexiform neurofibroma ( PN ) , dermal neurofibroma , optic pathway tumor , brain tumor , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ( MPNST ) , juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia , pheochromocytoma . In addition , NF1 manifest essentially every organ system , example , skeletal vascular abnormality , cognitive deficit . Thus , care individual NF1 require multidisciplinary approach . The natural history NF1 related tumor manifestation poorly understood , NF1 relate tumor manifestation standard treatment option surgery . The NIH Clinical Center provide ideal infrastructure evaluation natural history rare disease . A good understanding natural history NF1 related tumor manifestation helpful design treatment study . The NCI , POB active clinical trial program NF1 related tumor manifestation include PN , MPNST , collaboration Dr. Douglas Stewart NHGRI , dermal neurofibroma . Unlike individual refractory solid cancer , individual NF1 near normal life expectancy , benign tumor progress slowly solid cancer . Individuals NF1 may thus participate multiple treatment trial . OBJECTIVES : The overall purpose descriptive NF1 Natural History study serve umbrella protocol ongoing NF1 clinical trial program allow longitudinal evaluation individual NF1 NF1 related tumor non tumor manifestation irrespective whether currently enrol treatment study , develop good understand biology NF1 related manifestation . Following patient longitudinally allow investigator develop well understanding natural history manifestation , provide basis development endpoint clinical trial potentially develop effective treatment . NF1 manifestation , follow longitudinally , include PN , MPNST , optic pathway tumor , dermal neurofibroma , NF1 associate pain , neuropsychological , motor , endocrine function . A comprehensive treatment plan recommendation develop communicated patient primary caregiver . ELIGIBILITY : Children , adolescent , adult confirm clinical diagnosis NF1 confirm NF1 mutation . DESIGN : Attempts make individual undergo comprehensive baseline evaluation include clinical phenotyping , genotyping , image tumor manifestation , pain , quality life , neuropsychological , motor , endocrine evaluation . The NF1 manifestation longitudinally monitor frequency every year every three year , extent time follow-up evaluation depend finding baseline .</detailed_description>
