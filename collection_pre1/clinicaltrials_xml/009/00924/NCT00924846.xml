	<brief_summary>Background/Objectives : Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure ( AHRF ) frequent cause pediatric ICU admission . Early treatment inhale nitric oxide ( iNO ) plus conventional mechanical ventilation ( CMV ) improve oxygenation , responsiveness significantly influence alveolar recruitment level . High-frequency oscillatory ventilation ( HFV ) conceptually attractive constant mean airway pressure optimize lung recruitment ; could maximize iNO effect . Aims : To analyze effect HFV oxygenation index AHRF child CMV iNO . Methods : Children AHRF ( oxygenation index ≥10 ) age one month 14 year CMV PEEP≥10cmH2O 5ppm iNO 1h randomly assign CMV ( CMVG , n=12 ) HFV ( HFVG , n=12 ) crossover design . Children chronic cardiac pulmonary disease exclude . Patients keep one two ventilation mode 8h , cross 8h , back complete 24h observation . Blood gas analysis , oxygenation index , hemodynamic variable record enrollment ( Tind ) , 1h iNO start every 4h ( T4h etc ) . The Mann-Whitney U test compare group age PRISM score , Fisher test gender . Moments group compare repeated measure analysis independent group . Significance consider p &lt; 0.05 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure ( AHRF ) frequent cause admission complicate evolution critically ill child . Mortality rate still high , mainly acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) evolve . Clinical management AHRF essentially supportive include control underlying infection , fluid balance hemodynamic status , nutritional support , optimize protective mechanical ventilation4,5,6 . Ventilatory strategy direct minimize ventilator-induced lung injury ( VILI ) , eliminate oxygen toxicity , control lung inflammation . Also , hypoxemia persists , additional treatment may implement , inhale nitric oxide ( iNO ) high-frequency oscillatory ventilation ( HFOV ) . Recently , demonstrate early treatment iNO associate protective conventional mechanical ventilation ( CMV ) cause acute sustained improvement oxygenation , early reduction ventilator setting associate high risk VILI oxygen toxicity ; might contribute reduce mortality rate child ARDS . However , many study give value iNO therapy lack impact mortality rate . Despite , consider improvement oxygenation promote NO inhalation may useful rescue therapy . Also , know responsiveness iNO significantly influence apply sufficient positive expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) , seem recruit additional alveolus gas exchange . In sense , HFOV attractive application constant mean airway pressure maintain `` open lung '' optimize lung recruitment ; could maximize iNO effect . Two experimental study show increased iNO effect gas use together HFOV . In ARDS adult , Authors study association demonstrate improvement oxygenation significant reduction FiO2 , probably due degree alveolar recruitment HFOV may increase amount alveolar/capillary interface available iNO act upon . In pediatrics , one study combine iNO HFOV newborn baby severe persistent pulmonary hypertension conclude association often successful treatment alone23 . After neonatal period , retrospective ( post hoc ) data analysis multicenter , randomize control trial effect iNO treatment AHRF conclude combination HFOV iNO cause great improvement oxygenation either treatment strategy alone . Therefore , question potential role association iNO therapy HFOV AHRF child still open remains define . Our hypothesis association early iNO treatment HFOV improve oxygenation consistently long time association gas protective conventional mechanical ventilation . The aim study analyze effect HFOV oxygenation index AHRF child CMV iNO therapy .</detailed_description>
