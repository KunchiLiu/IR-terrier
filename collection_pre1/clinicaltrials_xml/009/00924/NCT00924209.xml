	<brief_summary>Background : - Surgical resection treatment choice patient lung cancer , cure resection generally depend whether lymph node involve . A patient Stage IIIA ( N2 ) lung cancer cancer lymph node involve center chest ( mediastinum ) . - Studies show surgery alone treatment Stage IIIA ( N2 ) lung cancer effective chemotherapy follow surgery . - Giving chemotherapy upfront may prevent spread Stage IIIA ( N2 ) lung cancer tumor , may shrink tumor allow adequate surgery perform . It also think chemotherapy usually well tolerate major surgery , high dos give . Objectives : - To determine effectiveness combination three anti-cancer drug ( gemcitabine , cisplatin , bevacizumab ) give surgery . - To find effect drug combination may patient cancer . - To determine combination three drug give prior surgery effective safe , safe , less safe drug combination give surgery . Eligibility : - Patients Stage IIIA ( N2 ) lung cancer chemotherapy , radiation , surgery treat cancer . Design : - Evaluations treatment period determine eligibility : - Physical examination , include vital sign body weight check , pregnancy test woman become pregnant . - Tests evaluate heart lung function , echocardiogram . - Blood urine test . - Disease evaluation compute tomography ( CT ) , chest X-ray , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan , bronchoscopy/mediastinoscopy ( examination inside chest lung ) . - Treatment intravenous gemcitabine , cisplatin , bevacizumab three 21-day cycle . - Cycles 1 2 - Gemcitabine day 1 day 8 , cisplatin day 1 , bevacizumab day 1 . - Cycle 3 - Gemcitabine day 1 day 8 , cisplatin day 1 ( bevacizumab ) . - Physical examination test conduct throughout cycle . - Surgery take place 4 6 week last cycle heart lung function satisfactory cancer remain stable . - Chemotherapy ( four 21-day cycle cisplatin etoposide treatment ) , evaluation examination , followup study take place 4 8 week surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Neo-Adjuvant Gemcitabine , Cisplatin Bevacizumab Stage IIIA ( N2 ) Non-Squamous Cell Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Stage IIIA-N2 consider one therapeutically challenge controversial subset lung cancer . This heterogenous group patient tumor range minimal N2 ( find incidentally surgery ) multi-station bulky N2 disease . The extent mediastinal involvement inverse correlation survival . - The 5-year survival range 5-8 % patient bulky N2 disease , nearly 35 % patient single station , microscopic N2 involvement . - Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy chemo-radiotherapy show superior surgery alone . - Platinum-based induction chemotherapy early locally advanced non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) result radiological down-staging least 50 % patient , pathological complete response rate approximately 5 % . - Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy induction regimen increase radiological pathological down-staging rate , cost increase morbidity mortality surgical intervention . - Expectations turn towards possible incremental effect add target biological agent standard induction treatment . Primary Objectives : - To determine safety neo-adjuvant Gemcitabine/Cisplatin Bevacizumab stage IIIA-N2 non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) - To determine pathological complete response rate - To determine resectability rate - To determine extent surgery Eligibility : - Histologically confirm stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC ( non-squamous ) - No previous chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgery biological therapy lung cancer - Adequate organ bone marrow function Design : - Multi-center , international ( United States Of America ( USA ) /Croatia ) , open label phase II trial - Following Simon two-stage optimal design</detailed_description>
