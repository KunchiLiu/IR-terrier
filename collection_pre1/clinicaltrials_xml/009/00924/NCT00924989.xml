	<criteria>Histologically confirm adrenocortical carcinoma locally advance metastatic amenable surgical resection . Measurable disease accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) ( version 1.1 ) . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) &lt; = 2 Predicted life expectancy &gt; = 12 week . At least 1 2 prior drug regimen ( include molecular target therapy , systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy , biologics , and/or vaccine ) locally advanced/metastatic ACC . A minimum 3 week must elapse end prior treatment randomization . All patient must receive prior mitotane , either neoadjuvant , adjuvant , locally advanced/metastatic therapy . Adjuvant neoadjuvant mitotane therapy count prior drug regimen systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy . Prior radiation therapy permit provided patient recover acute , toxic effect radiotherapy prior randomization . A minimum 21 day must elapse end radiotherapy randomization . Prior surgery permit provided adequate wound healing occur prior randomization . Fasting glucose &lt; = 150 mg/dL ( 8.3 mmol/L ) . Adequate hematopoietic , hepatic , renal function define follow : Neutrophil count &gt; = 1.5 x 10^9 /L ; Platelet count &gt; = 100 x 10^9 /L ; Bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) ; AST ALT &lt; = 2.5 x ULN , &lt; = 5 x ULN patient document liver metastasis receive prior mitotane therapy ; Serum creatinine &lt; = 1.5 x ULN &lt; = 2.0 x ULN patient receive prior cisplatin . Patients , male female , reproductive potential ( ie , menopausal less 1 year surgically sterilize ) must agree practice effective contraceptive measure throughout study . Women childbearing potential must provide negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) within 14 day prior randomization . Patients must provide verbal write informed consent participate study . Radiologicallyconfirmed progressive disease within 6 month prior randomization . Concurrent use noninsulinotropic oral antihyperglycemic therapy permit dose stable &gt; = 4 week time randomization . Type 1 diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus currently require insulinotropic insulin therapy . Prior IGF1R inhibitor therapy . Malignancy ACC within past 3 year . Exceptions : resect basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin ; cure situ cervical carcinoma ; cure ductal carcinoma situ breast ; and/or cure superficial bladder cancer . History significant cardiovascular disease unless disease wellcontrolled . Significant cardiac disease include second/third degree heart block ; clinically significant ischemic heart disease ; mean QTcF interval &gt; 450 msec screening ; poorly control hypertension ; congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II worse ( slight limitation physical activity ; comfortable rest , ordinary physical activity result fatigue , palpitation , dyspnea ) . History cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) within 6 month prior randomization result ongoing neurologic instability . Use drug risk cause QT interval prolongation within 14 day prior Day 1 dosing . Active infection serious underlie medical condition ( include type active seizure disorder within 12 month prior randomization ) would impair ability patient receive study drug . History psychiatric condition might impair patient 's ability understand comply requirement study provide inform consent . Pregnant breastfeeding female . Symptomatic brain metastasis stable , require steroid , potentially life threatening , require radiation within 28 day prior randomization . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition study drug .</criteria>
