	<brief_summary>Background : - Ixabepilone member class drug call epothilones . These drug interfere ability cancer cell replicate . - Epothilones similar taxanes , another class drug , include drug Taxol . Taxol widely use treat variety cancer . - Ixabepilone work cell resistant Taxol . Objectives : - To determine whether ixabepilone effective treat cervical cancer . Eligibility : - Women 18 year age old cervical cancer . Design : - Patients receive ixabepilone intravenously ( vein ) 60 minute first 5 day 21-day treatment cycle . Their dosage may adjust accord body respond drug . - The number cycle woman receive depend response treatment . - Patients CT ( compute tomography ) scan test start treatment every treatment cycle determine response tumor ixabepilone . - Patients undergo tumor biopsy ( surgical removal sample tumor tissue ) ask biopsy do start treatment ixabepilone fourth fifth day treatment . This procedure optional .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background - Ixabepilone ( Ixempra ( Trademark ) , BMS-247550 , NSC 710428 ) semi-synthetic analog natural product epothilone B . - The epothilones novel class non-taxane microtubule-stabilizing agent obtain fermentation cellulose degrade myxobacteria , Sorangium cellulosum . - Ixabepilone active cancer model naturally insensitive paclitaxel develop resistance paclitaxel , in-vitro in-vivo . Objectives Primary- - Establish efficacy investigational agent ixabepilone patient cervical carcinoma administer daily one-hour infusion day 1 5 every three week , measure overall response ( PR ( partial response ) +CR ( complete response ) ) . Secondary- - Assess pharmacodynamic endpoint determine extent tubulin polymerization whether activation cellular death pathway distal target . - Estimate progression-free survival duration response . Eligibility - Age great 18 - Histologic cytologic confirmation cervical carcinoma ; either squamous cell non-squamous consist cervical adenocarcinoma , cervical adenosquamous carcinoma cervical carcinoma , non-squamous type . Design - Phase II study , open , non-randomized - Ixabepilone administer dose 6mg/m^2 daily day 1 5 , every three week . - Restaging do every two cycle use RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) - Planned maximum enrollment 76 person</detailed_description>
