	<brief_title>The Role Factor XIII Activation Peptide D-dimer Values Diagnosis Cerebral Venous Thrombosis ( CVT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Because broad clinical spectrum often difficult establish diagnosis cerebral venous thrombosis ( CVT ) . Combined MRI/MRV contrast-enhanced CT accurate method diagnosis CVT . However method often available emergency basis . This stress need additional widely available test coagulation marker exclude CVT . The diagnostic value D-dimer level exclusion CVT still debate . Other potential coagulation marker systematically investigate . The investigator aim assess overall accuracy D-dimer value FXIII activation peptide ( FXIII-AP ) , use newly develop ELISA test , exclude CVT patient clinical suspicion CVT . Consecutive patient clinical suspicion CVT emergency department University Hospital Bern include study two year period . All include patient receive standard care apply treat physician follow international recommendation . Patient involvement study shall influence treatment decision . On admission patient undergo complete diagnostic work-up , include clinical neurological examination , standard laboratory examination include D-dimer value , brain contrast CT and/or MRI/MRV . In addition , plasma FXIII-AP analyzed . FXIII-AP analyzed Hemostasis Research Laboratory , Department Hematology , University Bern , base newly develop highly sensitive specific ELISA method . The investigator blind clinical symptom diagnosis patient . The study conduct accord guideline STARD ( Standards Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy ) initiative . The following primary evaluation criterion analysed:1 ) The overall diagnostic accuracy FXIII-AP exclude CVT patient clinical suspicion CVT ; 2 ) The overall diagnostic accuracy D-dimer exclude CVT patient clinical suspicion CVT ; 3 ) Roc curve calculate . Prespecified subgroup analyse perform accord clinical presentation : 1 ) isolate headache ; 2 ) isolate intracranial hypertension ( headache papilledema ) ; 3 ) Focal neurological deficit and/or seizure and/or disturbance consciousness . Furthermore , prespecified subgroup analysis perform accord mode onset : 1 ) acute ( symptoms &lt; 48 hour duration ) ; 2 ) subacute ( symptoms &gt; 48 hour &lt; 7 day duration ) ; 3 ) chronic ( symptoms &gt; 7 day duration ) . The following secondary evaluation criterion assess : 1 ) The overall frequency CVT patient clinical suspicion CVT ; 2 ) The overall frequency diseases patient clinical suspicion CVT ; 3 ) The site involve vein sinus patient CVT . Objective The investigator aim assess overall accuracy D-dimer value FXIII activation peptide ( FXIII-AP ) , use newly develop ELISA test , exclude CVT patient clinical suspicion CVT . Methods Consecutive patient clinical suspicion CVT emergency department University Hospital Bern include study two year period . All include patient receive standard care apply treat physician follow international recommendation . D-dimer measurement entry perform use rapid sensitive assay . FXIII-AP analyzed Hemostasis Research Laboratory , Department Hematology , University Bern base highly sensitive specific ELISA method.The investigator blind clinical symptom diagnosis patient .</detailed_description>
