	<brief_summary>Background : - This study use cell call DMF5 treat patient metastatic melanoma ( melanoma spread beyond primary tumor site ) . - The DMF5 cell first obtain tumor patient melanoma HLA-A201 tissue type . The tumor cell grown laboratory , laboratory-grown cell give back patient , patient 's tumor shrink dramatically . In laboratory test , DMF5 cell also show shrink mouse melanoma tumor . Objectives : -To determine whether preparatory chemotherapy follow infusion DMF5 cell safe effective shrink melanoma tumor . Eligibility : -Patients metastatic melanoma tissue type HLA-A201 18 year age old . Design : - Patients preparatory regimen chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow infusion DMF5 cell high-dose interleukin . The chemotherapy , interleukin cell give intravenously ( vein ) . - Patients frequent blood test look side effect response treatment . - Patients may ask tumor biopsy ( surgical removal small piece tumor tissue ) examine effect treatment immune cell tumor . - Patients physical examination , compute tomography ( CT ) chest , abdomen pelvis laboratory test 4 6 week treatment monthly evaluate tumor . - The first group patient participate Phase I portion study , call dose escalation phase . This phase determine high safe dose DMF5 cell . There three dose level DMF5 cell , first patient enrol get small dose increase dose precede level show safe . - Patients Phase II portion study receive DMF5 cell high dose find safe Phase I , test effectiveness treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : In previous trial Surgery Branch , 51 percent objective response rate observe heavily pre-treated patient metastatic melanoma undergo adoptive cell transfer therapy utilize non-myeloablative preparative regimen follow administration autologous tumor-reactive lymphocyte subsequent treatment high-dose aldesleukin . However , patient metastatic melanoma undergo metastasectomy , recovery adequate number tumor specific T lymphocytes surgical specimen possible approximately half patient , thus limit application adoptive cell transfer therapy . Murine model perform Surgery Branch demonstrate solid tumor regression mouse treat allogeneic tumor specific T cell combine preinfusion lymphodepleting regimen . We identify tumor specific lymphocyte cell line ( DMF5 ) use previously autologous adoptive cell transfer protocol associate objective clinical response patient . In subsequent preclinical test lymphocyte population , demonstrate high specificity HLA-A 0201 positive melanoma cell line well common share melanocyte differentiation antigen MART-1:27-35 . We expand lymphocyte population provide 30 individual allogeneic cell transfer HLAA 0201 positive patient metastatic melanoma . In trial want test hypothesis objective tumor regression achieve DMF5 allogeneic T-cell product use non-myeloablative regimen follow cell transfer high-dose aldesleukin . It emphasize protocol design test whether highly melanoma reactive allogeneic lymphocytes mediate cancer regression . The DMF5 cell line limit reagent available treatment 30 patient . However , treatment result cancer regression , represent important step development allogeneic T-cell receptor engineer universal effector cell line treatment patient cancer . Objectives : To evaluate safety administration DMF5 allogeneic T-cell product patient receive non- myeloablative conditioning regimen , aldesleukin . To determine whether allogeneic tumor-specific lymphocyte cell line , hereafter refer DMF5 , infused conjunction administration high-dose aldesleukin may result objective clinical tumor regression eligible HLA-A 0201 positive patient metastatic melanoma receive non-myeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen . To determine vivo survival infuse cell follow non-myeloablative regimen , via analysis sequence variable region T cell receptor flow cytometry ( FACS ) . Eligibility : Patients metastatic melanoma great equal 18 year age , HLA-A 0201 positive , suitable autologous tumor reactive TIL cell available , able tolerate high-dose aldesleukin . Design : Patients receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regiment consist cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg/kg/day time 2 day intravenous ( IV ) ) fludarabine ( 25 mg/m2/day IV time 5 day ) . Patients receive intravenous adoptive transfer tumor reactive lymphocyte cell line DMF5 ( expansion interleukin-2 OKT3 ) follow high-dose intravenous ( IV ) aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg/dose every 8 hour 15 dos ) . Patients undergo complete evaluation tumor physical examination , CT chest , abdomen , pelvis clinical laboratory evaluation four six week treatment monthly approximately 3 4 month study criterion meet . The study conduct use Phase I/II optimal design . The protocol proceed phase 1 dose escalation design , three cohort . Should single patient experience dose limit toxicity particular dose level , three patient would treat dose confirm great 1/6 patient DLT prior proceed next high level . If level 2 DLTs 3-6 patient identify , three additional patient accrue next lowest dose , total 6 , order characterize safety maximum tolerate dose prior start phase II portion . If dose limit toxicity occur first cohort , cohort expand 6 patient . If 2 DLTs encounter cohort , study terminate . Once MTD determine , study would proceed phase II portion , initially , 9 total patient administer therapy maximum tolerate dose . The plan utilize Simon two-stage optimal phase II design . If 0 9 patient experience clinical response , patient enrol 1 first 9 evaluable patient enrol clinical response , accrual continue total 30 evaluable patient enrol . This design ability distinguish 5 % response rate ( p0=0.05 ) 25 % response rate ( p1=0.25 ) , 10 % probability falsely `` accept '' DMF5 cell therapy approach ( alpha=0.10 ) , 10 % probability incorrectly discard strategy unacceptably poor ( beta=0.10 ) . This design also 63 % probability stop early ( 9 patient ) true response rate 5 % .</detailed_description>
