	<brief_summary>Background : - One standard way give radiation combine external beam treatment internal brachytherapy treatment , involve short-range radiation therapy give high dose radiation directly cancer area cancer cell remove . - Brachytherapy do place hollow implant device ( ) area treat move radiation source . The type device depend type cancer site treat . These device range hollow applicator needle balloon-like equipment . Objectives : - To evaluate quality brachytherapy procedure National Institutes Health Radiation Oncology Branch . Eligibility : - Patients cancer could potentially benefit high-dose brachytherapy part treatment . Design : - In conjunction exist treatment , patient treat high-dose brachytherapy determine appropriate particular type cancer cancer history . - Each treatment take place Radiation Oncology Clinic . - If patient implant device , clinic staff insert check placement compute tomography ( CT ) scan . - The calculation determine appropriate brachytherapy dose take hour ; brachytherapy treatment take 10 30 minute . - The number brachytherapy treatment vary accord individual need requirement type cancer patient . - Patients return Radiation Oncology Clinic followup visit 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month completion radiation therapy . Followup evaluation include medical history physical examination , assessment side effect radiation therapy , repeat imaging ( i.e. , CT , MRI , X-ray ) do baseline evaluate tumor response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Patients Receiving High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - High dose rate brachytherapy ( HDR ) challenge technique utilize many malignancy order deliver high dose radiation therapy tumor conformal fashion rapid dose fall-off objective sparing normal surround tissue - HDR therapy target particular subsites integral part either definitive management palliation malignancy-related symptom . OBJECTIVES : - The primary objective determine quality high dose rate brachytherapy implant perform radiation oncology branch . An implant adequate 90 % GTV receive 90 % dose prescribed 80 % CTV receive 85 % prescribe dose . An implant inadequate dose limitation meet . - To evaluate local control late toxicity rate follow brachytherapy NCI ROB - To increase flow oncology patient require brachytherapy NCI ROB , patient lend special study unique educational value purpose educate nurse , medical student , resident , physicist , clinical fellow , physician . ELIGIBILITY : -Patients cancer could potentially benefit use high dose rate brachytherapy component treatment . DESIGN : - Patients undergo appropriate work-up clinical evaluation determine high-dose brachytherapy would beneficial either primary treatment palliation disease . Patients treat high-dose brachytherapy appropriately sequenced modality treatment regimen . This treatment administer accordance standard radiation oncology practice per ABS ( American Brachytherapy Society ) guideline . - The natural history patient disease status toxicity outcomes document 12-month period 3-months interval .</detailed_description>

Patients childbearing child father potential must willing use medically acceptable form birth control , include abstinence , treat study . 6 . Sitespecific inclusion criterion ( one follow ) : Gynecologic Cancers : Endometrial cancer Patients high risk recurrence ( either grade , myometrial invasion , lymphatic vascular space invasion , tumor size , lymph node status , tumor extension , presence absence surgical staging ) Patients suffer recurrence vaginal cuff Patients unable undergo surgery must treatment inoperable primary endometrial cancer . Cervical cancer Patients unable undergo surgery must treatment inoperable primary cervical cancer . Patients locally advanced cervical cancer brachytherapy integrate boost external beam radiation either palliative curative setting ( definitive postoperative setting ) . Lung cancer Patients endobronchial component cause symptom Patients undergo resection poor lung function distant lung metastasis Breast cancer Infiltrating ductal carcinoma DCIS , stage T0 , T1 , T2 le equal 3.0 cm , N0 M0 , Patients benefit HDR either boost accelerate partial breast irradiation regimen . Prostate Cancer Patients localized prostate cancer ( T1bT3b ) brachytherapy integrate boost external beam radiation use monotherapy definitive management . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Cognitively impaired patient give inform consent legal guardian . 2 . Patients currently receive concurrent investigational chemotherapeutic agent . 3 . Patients receive concomitant chemotherapy administration 5 day precede brachytherapy ( except gynecological cancer patient may receive concurrent chemotherapy component treatment regimen ) 4 . Pregnant breastfeeding female exclude potential mutagenic effect develop fetus newborn . 5 . Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness ( serious infection significant cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic organ dysfunction ) , judgment Principal Associate Investigator would compromise patient ability tolerate therapy likely interfere study procedure result . 6 . Patients estimation PI , deem unable unlikely adhere protocol treatment . 7 . Abnormal bleed time active anticoagulation therapy . platelet le 100,000 per mm ( 3 ) PT/PTT great 1.5 upper normal limit ( UNL ) 8 . Any patient tumor/anatomical factor may prevent brachytherapy apparatus properly safely insert position radiation therapy administer per ABS guideline . 9 . Patients whose malignancy one follow sitespecific criterion disqualify study : 1 . Breast cancer : Patients inappropriate standard breast conservation therapy ( Multicentric disease , inability achieve clear margin ) ; male patient breast cancer autoimmune disorder , include SLE , Scleroderma , etc distant metastasis ; 2 . Prostate cancer : distant metastasis</criteria>
