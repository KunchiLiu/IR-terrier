In PAL- 003 , subject 's dose adjust need attain maintain blood Phe concentration 60-600 µmol/L . rAvPAL-PEG dose base either subject 's weight fix dose ( subject maintain blood Phe level 60-600 µmol/L least 2 consecutive week maintain stable rAvPAL-PEG dose least 2 consecutive week ) . Doses evaluated individual basis .</detailed_description>
