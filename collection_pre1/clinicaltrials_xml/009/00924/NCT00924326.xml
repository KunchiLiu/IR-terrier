	<brief_summary>Background : The NCI Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy treat patient B cell lymphoma leukemias involve take white blood cell patient , grow laboratory large number , genetically modify specific cell type virus ( retrovirus ) attack tumor cell , give cell back patient . This type therapy call gene transfer . In protocol , modify patient white blood cell retrovirus gene anti-CD19 incorporated retrovirus . Objective : The purpose study determine safe number cell infuse see particular tumor-fighting cell ( anti-CD19 cell ) cause tumor shrink . Eligibility : - Adults age 18-68 B cell lymphoma leukemia express CD19 molecule . Design : Work stage : Patients see outpatient NIH clinical Center undergo history physical examination , scan , x-ray , lab test , test need Leukapheresis : If patient meet requirement study undergo leukapheresis obtain white blood cell make anti-CD19 cell . { Leukapheresis common procedure , remove white blood cell patient . } Treatment : Once cell grown , patient admit hospital conditioning chemotherapy anti-CD19 cell . They stay hospital 4 week treatment . Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every 1-3 month first year , every 6 month 1 year long tumor shrink . Follow visit take 2 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CAR T Cell Receptor Immunotherapy Patients With B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - We construct retroviral vector encodes anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) recognize CD19 antigen . This chimeric receptor also contain signal domain CD28 CD3-zeta . The retroviral vector use mediate genetic transfer CAR T cell high efficiency ( &gt; 50 % ) without need perform selection . - In co-cultures CD19-expressing target cell , anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell secrete significant amount IFN-y IL-2 . - We develop process cryopreserving cell product may lead ability product manufacture central location ship institution treatment broader patient population OBJECTIVES : - Primary objective - With approval amendment S , determine safety feasibility administration cryopreserved anti-CD19-CAR engineer peripheral blood lymphocyte nonmyeloablative condition regimen patient Bcell lymphomas . ELIGIBILITY : Patients 18 year age old must : - CD19-expressing B-cell malignancy type - non-responder , recur one standard chemotherapy-containing regimen malignancy - currently require treatment due progressive malignancy - deem incurable standard therapy Patients may : - history allogeneic stem cell transplantation - CNS disease DESIGN : - PBMC obtain leukapheresis ( approximately 5 X 109 cell ) culture presence anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) aldesleukin order stimulate T-cell proliferation . - Transduction initiated exposure approximately 108 5 X 108 cell retroviral vector supernatant contain anti-CD19 CAR . - With approval amendment S , patient receive fludarabine cyclophosphamide chemotherapy ( NMA ) lymphocyte-depletion , follow cryopreserved anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell . - Patients follow disease progression - Patients respond treatment progress may receive one retreatment</detailed_description>
