	<brief_summary>Based preliminary quantitative gait finding suggest limited passive hip extension range key functionally limit impairment affect gait , investigator propose supervise , specific stretch exercise aim improve peak hip extension overall gait performance . While one goal demonstrate reduce peak passive hip extension key , functionally significant , reversible , impairment another improve understanding relationship impairment , functional limitation gait ability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Test hypothesis passive dynamic hip extension comfortable fast walk speed reduce elderly group compare passive dynamic peak hip extension healthy young adult . 2 . Test hypothesis , separately elderly group , control co-factors , great change step length treatment group compare control group , control co-variates . We also expect great change dynamic hip peak extension , reduction anterior pelvic tilt , improvement age-related reduction peak ankle plantar flexion ankle power generation , dynamic CoM-CoP moment arm comfortable fast walking , increase comfortable walk speed . 3 . Test hypothesis separately frail elderly group independently perform IADL , control co-factors , great change secondary , non quantitative gait-parameters Timed Get Up Go Test , Activities Daily Living , Instrumental ADL function , fear fall number fall 6 month follow intervention . 4 . Test hypothesis create forward dynamic model accurately predict individual subject , actual effect increase passive peak hip extension dynamic peak hip extension , anterior pelvic tilt , peak ankle plantar flexion step length .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Healthy Elderly Adult Subjects : 1 . 100 subject age 65 year older recruit Charlottesville area . 2 . Participants ask fill health questionnaire identical use preliminary study . This questionnaire verify participant meet inclusion criterion propose research project . 3 . After initial health questionnaire screening , participant undergo facetoface history physical examination screening . Frail Elderly Subjects : 1 . 100 subject age 65 year old meet criterion able function independently , consider frail , live within great Charlottesville area recruit participation study . Healthy Elderly : 1. acute medical illness , 2. diagnosis symptom unstable angina congestive heart failure , 3. pulmonary diagnosis symptom emphysema , chronic obstructive disease asthma shortness breath result pulmonary diagnosis bring walk flat surface , 4. advance cancer , 5. neurologic diagnosis include Parkinson 's Disease , stroke , brain injury , cerebellar disease , myelopathy , myopathy , peripheral neuropathy , active radiculopathy , 6. major orthopedic diagnosis lower back , pelvis , low extremity , include hip fracture since age 50 , fuse joint , joint replacement , amputation , 7. severe osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis active joint musculoskeletal pain back low extremity occur rest walking , 8. severe osteoporosis history fragility fracture occur past 12 month , 9. regular use assistive device walking . Exclusion criterion per physical examination : 1. physical sign congestive heart failure , 2. muscle weakness ( less 4/5 manual muscle test strength low extremity focal finding 1/5 strength difference side upper low extremity ) , absent knee extensor reflex positive Babinski response , 3. correct visual acuity bad 20/100 presence field defect , 4. poor mental state define MiniMental Status Examination score less equal 24/30,133 5. orthostatic hypotension ( great 20mmHg decline systolic blood pressure supine stand one minute ) , 6. unilateral sensory deficit low extremity , bilateral sensory loss stock distribution , proprioception le 75 % correct identify great toe position , vibration ( 128Hz tune fork ) perceive less 10 second either great toe medial malleolus either extremity . Frail Elderly ( Function Independently ) : 1. unable walk independently ( i.e. , unable walk without assistance another person ) , 2. either acute medical condition chronic underlie medical condition would make unfeasible unsafe participate . 3 . Regular use assistive device , cane , walk exclusion criterion long : use device , subject require assistance another person subject walk without assistive device ( supervisory , physical assistance need ) length test walkway , ten time ( rest period ) his/her comfortable walk speed faster walk speed . 4 . Based upon questionnaire medical history , follow specific exclusion criterion use : acute medical illness , symptom angina dyspnea bring walk flat surface , hip knee replacement surgery hip fracture previous six month , advance cancer and/or life expectancy le 12 month , dementia illness characterize cognitive impairment . 5 . Based upon physical examination , subject exclude : physical sign congestive heart failure , cognitive impairment define MiniMental Status Examination score less equal 24/30133 orthostatic hypotension ( great 20mm Hg decline systolic blood pressure supine stand one minute ) .</criteria>
