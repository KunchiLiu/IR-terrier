	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) second leading cause cancer Puerto Rico ( PR ) accounting approximately 1,500 individual annually , represent 12 % cancer case island . The genetic epidemiology CRC among Hispanic population well study , hence study focus large , well define ethnic group Puerto Ricans , clearly warrant . The first step towards evaluate molecular , environmental , genetic epidemiology CRC PR establish population-based familial CRC registry . The follow specific aim propose : Specific Aim 1 : To prospectively identify recruit approximately 300 CRC probands two distinct geographical area PR ( Metropolitan Southern Region ) . From proband investigator obtain pedigree extend second-degree relative cousin . Assuming 10 % positive family history CRC , investigator recruit 30 probands family history CRC sample 15 family-history negative probands obtain : paraffin-embedded tumor block , blood sample , risk factor food frequency questionnaire . Specific Aim 2 : To prospectively identify recruit select relative ( parent , grandparent , generation relative - cousin sibling ) 45 probands identify Specific Aim 1 . In addition , sibling cousin probands ( i.e . relatives generation proband ) , investigator obtain risk factor food frequency questionnaire , colorectal cancer case , tumor block pathology report cancer . Specific Aim 3 : To estimate pilot study follow parameter : ( ) response rate probands select relative ; ( b ) response rate participant data item ; ( c ) family history CRC cancer ; ( ) number live first- second-degree relative cousins probands ; ( e ) number relative live household region/municipality ; ( f ) prevalence/distribution select risk factor administer questionnaire .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Data obtain study serve foundation large , island-wide , population-based , genetic-epidemiologic study familial colorectal cancer Puerto Rico . Through feasibility study , assess feasibility : ( 1 ) recruiting colorectal cancer patient use PR Central Cancer Registry , ( 2 ) evaluate family pedigree recruit relative probands ( 3 ) obtain tumor , blood , medical exposure information probands relative . Providing important data Hispanic population would enable family-based case-control study risk factor CRC , emphasis candidate gene select carcinogenic pathway , genetic epigenetic modification . Furthermore , information obtain proposal may serve identify family would informative linkage study potentially map new gene , evaluate genotype-phenotype correlation , gene-gene gene-environmental interaction .</detailed_description>
