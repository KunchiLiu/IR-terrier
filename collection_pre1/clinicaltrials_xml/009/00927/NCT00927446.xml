	<brief_summary>Patients head neck cancer frequently develop synchronous metachronous esophageal malignancy . Previous study demonstrate efficacy endoscopic screen esophageal cancer head neck cancer patient . The Narrow Band Imaging ( NBI ) system , optical technology enhances visualization superficial vascular network , may superior conventional white light endoscopy detection neoplastic lesion . However , whether application NBI improve detection result critically evaluate . This study aim investigate diagnostic value NBI system endoscopic screen esophageal neoplastic lesion patient head neck cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective blind control tandem endoscopy trial conduct regional medical center ( Lotung Poh-Ai Hospital , Taiwan ) . Patients tissue diagnosis head neck cancer enrol . Endoscopy screen esophageal lesion first perform use conventional white light system . Suspicious lesion record . Then entire esophagus examine NBI system another endoscopist , blind result conventional endoscopy . After endoscopic inspection complete , suspicious lesion biopsied . Before procedure , one two participate endoscopists applies conventional NBI system randomize . The diagnostic rate esophageal neoplasm conventional white light system NBI system compare . The endpoint neoplastic lesion detect endoscopic biopsy . We consider invasive cancer , carcinoma in-situ , high-grade dysplasia ( usually distinguish carcinoma situ ) primary point . Any dysplastic lesion consider secondary point .</detailed_description>
