	<brief_title>Evaluation Nasal Allergen Challenge Procedure Using Dust Mite Extract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study serve pilot safety study implementation new technique nasal allergen challenge . The new technique consist patient maximally inhale total lung capacity . A nasal meter dose pump use deliver Dermatophagoides farinae allergen nasal mucosa . The patient sniff allergen delivery previous study instead exhale mouth . The investigator propose technique inhibit large amount allergen reach airway mucosa beyond nasal site introduction thus limit serious adverse event .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Specific allergy house dust mite Dermatophagoides farinae confirm positive immediate skin test response . 2 . Subjects may enrol mild asthma FEV1 least 80 % predict FEV1/FVC ratio least .70 ( without use bronchodilating medication 12 hour ) . This consistent lung function person mild episodic mild persistent asthma . For purpose protocol , asthmatic individual define : ) positive methacholine challenge provocative concentration methacholine produce 20 % fall FEV1 ( PC20 methacholine ) less equal 10 mg/ml method use ; OR b ) physician diagnose asthma symptom chronic daily therapy consistent mild asthma . 3 . Ability withhold antihistamine medication one week prior screen visit one week prior nasal allergen challenge visit . 4 . Subjects must able willing give inform consent . 1 . Any chronic medical condition consider PI contraindication allergen challenge study include significant cardiovascular disease , diabetes require medication , chronic renal disease , chronic thyroid disease . 2 . Physician direct emergency treatment asthma exacerbation within precede 12 month . 3 . Use systemic steroid therapy within precede 12 month treatment asthma exacerbation . 4 . Use inhaled nasal steroid , cromolyn , leukotriene inhibitor ( Montelukast Zafirlukast ) within past month ( except use cromolyn exclusively prior exercise ) . 5 . Use allergen immunotherapy . 6 . Use daily theophylline within past month . 7 . Use nasal medication might alter response nasal allergen challenge include antiinflammatory antihistamine agent within one week challenge . 8 . Pregnancy nurse baby . 9 . Cigarette smoke within past 12 month . 10 . Nighttime symptom cough wheeze great 1x/week baseline ( clearly recognize viral induced asthma exacerbation ) would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . 11 . Exacerbation asthma 2x/week would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . 12 . Daily requirement albuterol due asthma symptom ( cough , wheeze , chest tightness ) would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . ( Not include prophylactic use albuterol prior exercise ) . 13 . Vitamin herbal supplementation consider PI antiinflammatory and/or antioxidant property must stop 7 day prior entrance study . 14 . A history nasal sinus surgery within last 5 year . 15 . Viral URI within four week challenge . 16 . Acute infection require use antibiotic within last four week . Must antibiotic least two week prior study . 17 . Participation allergen challenge study within two week challenge use investigational agent within last 30 day . 18 . Use tricyclic antidepressant , betablockers , monoamine oxidase inhibitor drug may interfere treatment anaphylaxis . 19 . Subjects history immunologic disease immune suppression cancer disease .</criteria>
