	<brief_title>Evaluation Brainsway Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) H-Coil Treatment Major Depression Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study multicenter , randomize double blind , sham control study evaluate safety efficacy H-coil deep transcranial magnetic stimulation ( dTMS ) treatment patient major depressive disorder previously unsuccessfully treat antidepressant medication . Studies repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , typically use figure-8 coil , show stimulate superficial brain region beneficial treat major depression . Differing traditional figure-8 coil , H-coil design stimulate deep brain region related motivation , reward , pleasure . Preliminary study conduct seem indicate stimulating certain brain area H-coil , dTMS may antidepressant effect . The study population consist patient major depressive disorder fail adequate medication treatment show significant intolerance medication . The study duration 18 week , 2 week period wean patient medication , follow 4 week 5 daily treatment 12 week biweekly treatment . Mood mental state carefully monitor standard psychological scale rating drug taper-down throughout treatment .</detailed_description>
