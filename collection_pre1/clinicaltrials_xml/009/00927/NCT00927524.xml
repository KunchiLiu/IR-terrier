	<brief_summary>Intensive control Type 1 Diabetes critical prevention long term complication . Unfortunately , three-fold increase hypoglycemia intensive control . Hypoglycemia often major limit factor achieve good control . Insulin treatment diabetes compose form short act insulin regimen order provide control blood glucose excursion result glucose intake well basal insulin regimen either continuous administration ( continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion- '' pump therapy '' ) , day injection ( insulin Glargine ) , twice day ( ultralente NPH lente insulin ) premixed version combine short act insulin ( 70/30 75/25 ) . Often low blood sugar result less physiologically absorbed insulin whose peak action earlier later peak absorption glucose meal . Apidra ( glulisine insulin ) new short act insulin analogue whose peak duration action ideal may administer appropriately prior even meal evidence good control blood glucose excursion meal . The purpose study compare effect Apidra upon meal relate blood glucose profile compare treat 70/30 insulin patient Type 1 Diabetes . The investigator also study healthy volunteer control treat insulin evaluate mealtime absorption blood glucose profile similar meal intake . The investigator use stable isotope tritiated glucose .</brief_summary>
