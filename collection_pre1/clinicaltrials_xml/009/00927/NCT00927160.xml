	<brief_title>Evaluation Mobile Acute Care Elderly ( MACE ) Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inpatient hospitalization elderly fraught hazard . Hospital complication delirium , fall , pressure ulcer common elderly . These complication may avoidable . Patient care unit specialize geriatric care , acute care elderly ( ACE ) unit , develop test demonstrated few patient discharge nursing home , improve ability acutely ill old patient perform basic activity daily live time discharge ( 1 ) . However , ACE unit model widely disseminate issue financial viability limitation . Mobile Acute Care Elderly ( MACE ) unit , new model geriatric inpatient care , newly develop Mount Sinai Hospital use since July 2007 . MACE consist team care provider dedicate care inpatient hospitalize elderly patient . The team consist attend geriatrician , geriatrics fellow , nurse practitioner , social worker . The potential benefit MACE team general medicine medical service include specific attention need elderly inpatient setting , potential complication , avoidance potentially harmful medication improve communication transition care . Other quality outcome measure length stay , re-hospitalization rate may affect result MACE care . The purpose study evaluate patient care use quality marker include length stay , re-hospitalization rate , patient satisfaction patient admit Mobile Acute Care Elderly Unit compare prospectively match propensity score match control group patient admit general medicine service . Description cohort group selection method We aim enroll Mobile ACE patient satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion . To match patient General Medical Unit similar characteristic Mobile ACE patient , match patient accord age ( within 5 year ) , admit diagnosis , ability ambulate independently ( functional status ) . We aim match Mobile ACE patient ( case group ) one general medical unit patient ( control group ) match characteristic . In order , establish pool Mobile ACE patient pool general medicine patient enroll patient pool satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion accord prospective matching protocol establish validate Charpentier et al . ( 2 ) This match algorithm select demonstrate achieve balance across prognostic factor trial randomize allocation treatment group possible . The method involve prospective individual matching patient already assign treatment group ( case , Mobile ACE unit general medical unit ) . The method provide methodologically rigorous alternative achieve balance across treatment group , respect important prognostic factor , non-randomized trial randomization possible . For patient Mobile ACE unit satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion , determine matching patient control group pool . If , enroll patient match patient matching patient control group . If match control group pool , enroll patient case group pool . Because aim match patient concurrently , match patient admission date within 180 day . For patient general medical unit satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion , match characteristic assess match pool case group patient , patient enrol . If successful match case group patient , enroll patient pool control group patient pool control group patient fewer predetermine size 10 patient ; pool control group patient 10 patient , enroll patient randomly predetermine probability pool control group patient .</detailed_description>
