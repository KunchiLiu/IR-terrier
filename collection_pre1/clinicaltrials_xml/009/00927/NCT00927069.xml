	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Adalimumab Patients Who Showed Unsatisfactory Response Etanercept</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 50 patient psoriasis vulgaris show unsatisfactory response etanercept 50 mg twice week follow 50 mg week total 50 patient show unsatisfactory response etanercept 50 mg twice week without dose reduction recruit . All patient receive adalimumab 40 mg every week ( EOW ) 12 week . Patients fail reach physician 's global assessment ( PGA ) clear almost clear week 12 increase adalimumab 40 mg every week ( EW ) additional 12 week . Patients reach PGA clear almost clear week 12 continue receive adalimumab 40 mg EOW additional 12 week . Patients evaluate safety efficacy every 4 week total 24 week . PASI , BSA PGA perform visit . Routine chemistry , hematology urinalysis perform every 4 week . The percentage patient achieve physician 's global assessment ( PGA ) clear almost clear least 12 week adalimumab calculate patient show unsatisfactory response 3 month etanercept 50 mg twice week without dose reduction well patient show unsatisfactory response 3 month etanercept 50 mg twice week follow 50 mg week . A physician 's global assessment ( PGA ) clear define plaque elevation normal skin . There scale . Erythema perceptible hyperpigmentation , pigment macule , diffuse faint pink red coloration . A physician 's global assessment ( PGA ) almost clear defined follow : It possible difficilt ascertain whether slight elevation normal skin . There scale form surface dryness white coloration . Erythema definite red coloration .</detailed_description>
