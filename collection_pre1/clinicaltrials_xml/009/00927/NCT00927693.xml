	<brief_summary>Early Identification Subclinical Atherosclerosis Noninvasive Imaging Research ( EISNER ) multi-study research program conduct Cedars-Sinai Medical Center . The principal objective randomize trial ( refer `` Study 1 '' ) ass whether coronary artery calcium ( CAC ) scan provide clinical benefit thus improve patient outcome asymptomatic subject intermediate coronary artery disease ( CAD ) risk . Additionally , study design ass value combine CAC scan Framingham risk score ( FRS ) measurement serum plasma biomarkers predict outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At baseline eligible subject underwent clinic visit randomize 2:1 `` scan group '' complete cardiac risk assessment CAC scan `` scan group '' complete cardiac risk assessment . Both group underwent private counseling session train nurse practitioner review result receive customized health behavior suggestion base current American Heart Association guideline primary prevention heart disease . Subjects follow change clinical status , medication use specific health behavior one year baseline . Annually four year , subject follow subsequent diagnostic testing , therapy , outcomes related cardiac health . At four year baseline , subject ( group ) return repeat clinic visit complete cardiac risk assessment CAC scanning . Year 4 CAC scanning perform `` scan group '' `` scan group '' . Additional long-term followup conduct separate protocol .</detailed_description>
