	<brief_summary>Overall Objective : To evaluate pain functional status patient undergo surgical correction lumbar herniated disc , pre- post-surgery , use subjective ( VAS , Oswestry , PSQI , Patient Expectation ) , well , objective measure physical activity ( triaxial accelerometry ) . Design Methods : Two group subject examine ; 1 ) patient diagnose lumbar herniated disc undergo minimally invasive microdiscectomy ( MD ) , 2 ) patient diagnose lumbar herniated disc undergo open microlumbar discectomy ( OD ) . Subjects agree participate , assess ( assessment list ) diagnosis prior surgery . The subject assess postop continue follow-up surgery visit 3 week postop . Both method discectomy discussed subject . Once subject consent participate ( prior surgery ) , subject randomize 50/50 chance place MD OD group . Subjects distribute MD group OD group use block randomization method . The study single blind . A longitudinal , within group , comparison make assess change measure parameter . Data involve MD OD group accumulate cross-sectional fashion . Subjects recruited referral practice Orthopedic Neurosurgeon Spine Surgeons Health Sciences Centre . This encompass majority new currently manage case Manitoba Northwestern Ontario . Subjects age 18 90 . Male female subject recruit study . All patient clinically demonstrate unilateral low extremity pain great proportion low back pain symptom present . Imaging ( CT ) document single level lumbar herniated nucleus pulposis . Exclusion criterion cauda equina syndrome , progressive neurologic deficit , bilateral low extremity symptom , low back pain leg pain , existence significant co-morbidity ( e.g . cardiac condition , disease , etc . ) form , physical limitation ( musculoskeletal injury ) . Subjects participate required speak read English .</brief_summary>
