	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare low dose oral contraceptive ( OC ) give continuously ( every day three month ) low dose oral contraceptive give interrupted regimen ( one week inactive placebo pill month ) continuous placebo ( inactive placebo give every day three month ) . The primary hypothesis continuous OC significantly effective reduce premenstrual symptom compare either interrupted OC continuous placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Oral Contraceptive Treatment Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder ( PMDD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder ( PMDD ) describe cyclic appearance affective symptom resultant impairment luteal phase menstrual cycle . The objective trial determine extend oral contraceptive ( OC ) regimens eliminate pill-free interval successfully prevent expression PMDD symptom . The central hypothesis application continuous administration OCs minimize destabilizing effect change reproductive steroid level prevent PMDD symptom emergence . The cause PMDD unknown , morbidity substantial , identified treatment limited effectiveness , since 40 % PMDD woman non-responders elective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) . Earlier controlled study OCs treat PMDD fail find OCs superior placebo use traditional 21/7 platform ( 21 active pill follow 7 day pill-free interval ( PFI ) ) . Two recent trial low dose OC use 24/4 platform report great reduction premenstrual symptom relative placebo , presumably due shorten PFI . Despite apparent efficacy 3-day extend dose OC , placebo response rate substantial study , result low effect size . Moreover , steroid hormone level examine prior study . In absence hormonal data , inference mechanism efficacy extend OCs must remain speculative untested . Our propose research address critical role hormonal change precipitation PMDD symptom treatment continuous OC regimen , interrupt OC regimen ( 21/7 platform ) continuous placebo . This study also permit u examine role neurosteroids PMDD . While act acutely anxiolytic positive modulators gamma-aminobutyric acid A ( GABAA ) receptor , neurosteroids may paradoxically reduce response GABAA receptor cause irritability ( rat ) follow either extended exposure withdrawal . Further , prior research suggest elevate level change peripheral neurosteroid level associate dysphoric mood symptom woman PMDD . Our hypothesis change neurosteroids modulate symptom severity rather appearance PMDD . The result study suggest therapeutic target inform future study PMDD relate affective disorder .</detailed_description>
