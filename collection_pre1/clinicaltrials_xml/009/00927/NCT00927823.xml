	<criteria>Patients histologically cytologically confirm malignant solid tumor currently approve treatment unresponsive currently approve therapy . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status ( PS ) 01 Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 72 hour first dose PF04961502 , These patient partner must surgically sterile postmenopausal , must agree use effective contraception receive trial treatment least 3 month thereafter . Male patient partner must surgically sterile must agree use effective contraception receive trial treatment least 3 month thereafter . The definition effective contraception base judgment Principal Investigator designate associate Adequate Bone Marrow Function , include : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1500 cells/mm3 2 . Platelets ≥75,000 cells/mm3 3 . Hemoglobin ≥9 mg/dL Adequate Renal Function , include : SrCr &lt; 1.5 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) . OR Estimated creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min , calculate use method standard institution Adequate Liver Function , include : Bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN AST ( SGOT ) ≤2.5 x ULN ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 x ULN Adequate glucose control , include previous diagnosis diabetes mellitus HbA1c &lt; 7 % . Adequate Cardiac Function , include : 12Lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) normal trace non clinically significant change require medical intervention . QTc interval ≤470 msec history Torsades de Pointes symptomatic QTc abnormality Patients know active brain metastasis . Patients previously diagnose brain metastasis eligible complete CNS treatment recover acute effect radiation therapy surgery prior start study medication , discontinue corticosteroid treatment metastasis least 4 week neurologically stable Chemotherapy , radiotherapy ( palliative radiotherapy lesion follow tumor assessment study , ie , non target lesion ) , biological investigational agent within 2 week Baseline disease assessments Any surgery ( include minor procedure lymph node biopsy ) within 4 week Baseline disease assessment ; fully recover side effect previous procedure Prior therapy agent know propose active action PI3K and/or mTOR Prior highdose chemotherapy require hematopoetic stem cell transplantation within 12 month study treatment start Uncontrolled significant cardiovascular disease : A myocardial infarction within 12 month Uncontrolled angina within 6 month Congestive heart failure within 6 month . Diagnosed suspected congenital long QT syndrome . Any history ventricular arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , Torsades de pointes ) . Any history second third degree heart block ( may eligible currently pacemaker ) Heart rate &lt; 50/minute preentry electrocardiogram Uncontrolled hypertension . Current use anticipate need food drug know potent CYP3A4 inhibitor inducer Current use anticipate need food drug know potent CYP1A2 inhibitor inducer Concurrent administration herbal preparation Breast feeding : No study conduct human assess impact PF04691502 milk production , presence breast milk effect breastfed child .
