	<brief_summary>Background : - A cold sore usually blister rash near lip , cause infection herpes simplex virus . After first infection , virus go dormant ( inactive ) state , continue cause cold sore . - Most people herpes simplex virus episode cold sore per year . However , individual may many recurrent episode uncomfortable may cause embarrassment . Researchers attempt find treatment decrease number cold sore episode people six episode per year . - Glutamine molecule call amino acid one component make protein body . Clinical study use glutamine address potential glutamine improve immune function heal damage tissue help healing . Objectives : - To find dietary supplement glutamine help individual frequently recur ( six episode per year ) cold sore . Eligibility : - Patients 18 65 year age history six cold sore episode per year , receive certain kind drug treatment cold sore within 1 month begin study . - Patients two episode cold sore cause herpes simplex virus eligible treatment part study . Design : - Initial clinical visit physical examination medical history , blood sample draw test . - Eligible participant undergo 4-month screening period . Patients develop sore period visit NIH sore examine determine cause herpes virus . Patients two episode cold sore cause herpes simplex virus eligible treatment . - Patients eligible treatment provide initial blood sample receive randomize dos either glutamine glycine ( another amino acid ) , must take regular schedule twice daily , mixed either liquid soft food . Patients develop sore period visit NIH sore examine determine cause herpes virus . Blood , urine , saliva specimen collect month treatment period . A 2-week washout period occur 2 treatment period dose glutamine glycine take . - Patients undergo second 5-month treatment period either glutamine glycine ( whichever give first part study ) , take manner . Patients develop sore period visit NIH sore examine determine cause herpes virus . - After second treatment , patient remain touch researcher 1 month note change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Double-Blind Control-Comparison Crossover Trial Oral Glutamine Suppress Frequently Recurrent Herpes Labialis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Frequently recurrent herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ) infection lips perioral area , know herpes labialis , commonly cold sore , cause discomfort , pain , embarrassment . Traditional antiviral therapy moderately effective suppressing recurrence . Studies show amino acid glutamine affect HSV-1 reactivation vitro . Glutamine study various clinical situation find decrease morbidity critically ill patient ( reduce nosocomial infection ) , patient receive chemotherapy undergo bone marrow transplantation ( reduce severity stomatitis , reduce incidence infection , shorten hospital stay ) , patient short gut syndrome ( decrease requirement parenteral nutrition ) . No significant adverse consequence glutamine therapy report patient . We conduct randomize , double-blind , control-comparison crossover trial compare efficacy glutamine versus glycine ( control ) suppress recurrence herpes labialis patient frequent episode ( great equal 6 per year ) . Based vitro vivo data , hypothesize oral glutamine decrease number recurrence herpes labialis 5-month treatment period participant frequently recur herpes labialis compare control .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Adults , age 18 65 , report history 6 episode herpes labialis per year . 2 . Subject agree refrain use counter ( OTC ) , prescription supplemental antiviral medication without obtain permission study team course study . 3 . Women childbearing potential require willing practice two effective method birth control begin first treatment period continue end study . 4 . Women childbearing potential require negative pregnancy test time enrollment time randomization . 5 . To eligible randomization treatment phase study , participant must experience least 2 clinically confirm episode herpes labialis , 1 must virologically confirm , 4 month screen period . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Oral intravenous antiviral therapy &lt; 4 week enrollment study follow agent permit : acyclovir ( intravenous ) , ganciclovir ( intravenous oral ) , valganiciclovir ( oral ) , cidofovir ( intravenous ) , foscarnet ( intravenous ) . 1 . Suppressive therapy oral acyclovir , valacyclovir famciclovir topical antiviral 4 week prior enrollment study permit . 2 . Use oral acyclovir valacyclovir famciclovir topical antiviral ointment cream treatment herpes labialis outbreak study permit AFTER outbreak document study team.. 2 . Evidence active herpes labialis reactivation time enrollment . The volunteer enrol resolution herpes labialis inclusion exclusion criterion still meet . 3 . Subjects condition associate immunodeficiency ( e.g. , human immunodeficiency virus infection ) condition require either daily systemic corticosteroid exceed dose equivalent to10 mg/day prednisone significant immunosuppressant therapy ( e.g. , organ stem cell transplantation ) . 4 . Persons significant liver kidney disease [ serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [ SGOT ] , serum glutamine pyruvic transaminase [ SGPT ] , alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 time ULN , serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 time ULN ] . 5 . Persons active seizure disorder . For person prior history seizure , person seizure free 5 year antiseizure medication order enrol study . ( Since glutamine metabolize glutamate ammonia , glutamate main excitatory neurotransmitter central nervous system ( CNS ) , theoretical increase risk seizure ) . 6 . Women know pregnant ( pregnancy category C ) breastfeeding ( know whether glutamine excrete human milk ) . 7 . History allergic reaction glutamine glutamic acid derivative ( e.g. , monosodium glutamate ) glycine sucralose . 8 . Subjects take supplemental amino acid ( e.g. , glutamine , glycine , arginine , amino acid ) high protein supplement , Boost within 30 day enrollment study study ( except study drug amino acid ) . Subjects take vitamin . 9 . Persons treat atypical neuroleptic clozapine ( Clozaril , FazoCIo ) olanzapine ( Zyprexa , Zydis ) . 10 . Participation study involve investigational drug within 30 day prior entry trial . 11 . Any condition ( e.g. , schizophrenia , psychosis , major depression , mental deficiency illness ) major comorbidity study investigator think might compromise person 's ability comply requirement study .</criteria>
