	<brief_title>Effects Cardiovascular Training Individuals With Ankylosing Spondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease , affect primarily spinal column iliosacral joint . In addition , increase risk cardio-vascular disease osteoporosis describe patient AS . Patients AS may suffer severe impairment physical functioning , i.e . spinal stiffness , pain fatigue , reduces daily activity , quality life . As AS mainly affect young people , work capacity may reduce , , together medical treatment cost , result considerable burden society . Current treatment guideline AS ( ASAS/EULAR 2006 ) propose drug treatment , mainly non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , severe case inhibitor TNF alpha . In addition , mobility exercise cornerstone functional training recommend patient AS . The efficacy mobility exercise confirm third update ( 2007 , unpublished ) Cochrane review regard Physiotherapy AS . However , review also suggest mobility exercise effect important quality-of life relate outcome , pain , fatigue , cardiovascular fitness . Reduced physical activity due pain , fatigue reduce cardiovascular fitness may put patient AS increased risk immobility-induced bone loss vitamin D deficiency due limited outdoor activity . Finally , inactivity vitamin D deficiency may contribute elevate risk cardiovascular disease osteoporosis patient AS . Cardiovascular training may increase cardiovascular fitness , reduce pain fatigue , decrease bone loss . The intervention may also enhance vitamin D status increase amount physical activity perform outside . Vitamin D find reduce bone loss improve cardiovascular health .</detailed_description>
