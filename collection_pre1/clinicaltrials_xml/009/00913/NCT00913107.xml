	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Lamotrigine Treat Trigeminal Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trigeminal Neuralgia ( TGN ) rare form chronic facial pain shroud mystery , although life threatening , excruciate painful extraordinarily debilitate . Its uniqueness peculiarity ascertain fact TGN may present managed dentist , neurologist , neurosurgeon , oral surgeon ear , nose throat surgeon . The management TGN initially medical , `` gold standard '' drug carbamazepine ( CBZ ) . Whilst CBZ continue treatment choice , substantial proportion patient tolerate drug poorly , predominantly side-effects include drowsiness , accommodation disorder , hepatitis , elevation liver enzymes , renal dysfunction , congestive heart failure , delay multi-organ failure , leucopenia , thrombocytopenia etc . etc . If pain-relief incomplete CBZ produce adverse side-effects , option include use alternative second-line medical agent . The drug suggest consider second-line agent treatment TGN , include : lamotrigine , baclofen , phenytoin , oxcarbazepine , gabapentin , clonazepam , valproate , mexiletine , topiramate . Lamotrigine ( LTG ) , novel anticonvulsant , adequately assess antineuralgic property . It bimodal mechanism action : - inhibits release glutamate aspartate block voltage-sensitive sodium channel - antagonistic neuroexcitatory N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor . It also act inhibits calcium channel enhance gamma- Aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) synthesis . GABA inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter decrease neural membrane action potential therefore decrease nerve excitability . Glutamate implicate mechanism contribute towards phenomenon chronic pain , sensitisation wind . LTG inhibition pathological release glutamate , potential towards management chronic pain , particularly neuropathic origin . Lamotrigine , therefore potential promise new treatment TGN .</detailed_description>
