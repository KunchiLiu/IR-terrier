	<brief_summary>Background : - Liver cancer third deadly fifth common cancer worldwide . Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) frequent primary liver cancer , grown prevalent United States . - More information need cause effect liver cancer , research individual high risk develop liver cancer need early diagnosis prevention . Objectives : - To identify genetic factor may help explain aggressiveness liver cancer . - To determine HCC biomarkers exist blood , urine , tissue sample . Eligibility : - Patients age 18 90 diagnose HCC high risk develop HCC fatty liver disease ( alcohol-related non-alcohol-related ) chronic hepatitis B C. - Participants reside Baltimore City surround area . Design : - Participants complete questionnaire provide blood urine sample test : - The questionnaire include question individual family medical history , tobacco use , exposure know factor liver cancer . - Blood urine sample collect participant questionnaire . - Tumor tissue healthy tissue collect select participant undergo surgery cancer disease . - No specific treatment offer part protocol , participant option treat different protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Liver cancer third deadly fifth common cancer worldwide . Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) frequent primary cancer liver rise incidence United States . HCC patient dismal outcome underserved cancer population . We propose liver cancer case-control case-case study conduct Baltimore , Maryland . OBJECTIVES : Our research aim identify genetic genomic change might explain aggressive nature liver cancer . We test primary hypothesis HCC biomarkers exist blood product ( mouth wash ) , urine and/or tissue use early diagnosis prevention . A unique study factor use urine sample biomarker identification . A secondary goal examine whether certain genetic genomic factor modify liver cancer susceptibility use candidate genome wide association study approach . Although study investigate genetic susceptibility , large scale study conduct liver cancer . Our study also valuable due access frozen tumor specimens pre-therapy resection , whose collection require gene expression analysis . If certain gene relate HCC risk progression , tissue resource use validate finding laboratory investigation . The propose study design exploratory hypothesis generate . ELIGIBILITY : The participant reside Baltimore City surround area . Cases pathologically confirm liver cancer risk factor HCC development . Risk factor include chronic liver disease due hepatitis B and/or C viral infection , nonalcoholic steatohepatitis alcoholic cirrhosis . The study support epidemiological infrastructure develop University Maryland School Medicine resource contractor ongoing lung prostate cancer case-control study . The enrollment control begin concurrently case accrual , continue 5 year . Population-based control recruit use triple eligibility criterion , control eligible lung/prostate study ask complete supplemental questionnaire liver study . DESIGN : The study include 250 primary HCC case , 800 patient chronic liver disease ( high risk non-cancer case ) sample 800 population-based control . The HCC high risk non-cancer case recruit two Baltimore hospital , Veterans Affairs Medical Center , University Maryland School Medicine period 5 year . Controls identify Department Motor Vehicle database match case age , gender , race county residency . The study involve administration questionnaire collection blood ( mouth wash ) study subject . Fresh-frozen tumor tumor surround non-cancerous specimen obtain approximately 20 percent cancer patient . The case receive one questionnaire . The first 12 month constitute pilot study , evaluate refine recruitment procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : SELECTION OF CASE SUBJECTS ( HCC AND HIGH RISK NONCANCER CASES ) We recruit incident case pathologically confirm primary liver cancer risk factor liver cancer ( patient chronic liver disease due hepatitis B and/or C viral infection , nonalcoholic steatohepatitis alcoholic cirrhosis ) stag disease age great equal 18 year less equal 90 year . Treatment surgery therapy . The following check list use verify eligibility case subject . ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA HCC CANCER CASES 1 . Diagnosed primary liver cancer ( HCC ) within last two year 2 . Physician diagnosis base AFP ultrasound/imaging Pathological diagnosis primary liver cancer make local hospital pathology department 3 . Resides Maryland surround state 4 . Has residential work phone within his/her home ( *The reason participant residential work phone match population control select Department Motor Vehicles record must residential telephone number select part random sample . ) 5 . Age great equal 18 year less equal 90 year 6 . A nonobjection statement physician hospital patient identify , list treat physician tumor registry surgical pathology report , contact patient obtain 7 . Is currently reside institution , prison , nursing home , shelter 8 . Is severely ill patient intensive care unit 9 . Is able give inform consent 10 . Is physically mentally capable perform interview 11 . Must understand English well enough interview 12 . Has never interview control study 13 . Subject provide informed consent sign form . ELIGIBITY CRITERIA HIGH RISK NONCANCER CASES 1 . Has diagnose chronic Hepatitis B C , NASH alcoholic liver disease chronicity present least 6 month period 2 . Resides Maryland surround state 3 . Has residential work phone within his/her home 4 . Age great equal 18 year less equal 90 year 5 . A nonobjection statement physician hospital patient identify treated surgical pathology report , contact patient obtain 6 . Is currently reside institution , prison , nursing home , shelter 7 . Is severely ill patient intensive care unit 8 . Is able give inform consent 9 . Is physically mentally capable perform interview 10 . Must understand English well enough interview 11 . Has never interview control study 12 . Subject provide informed consent sign form . SELECTION OF POPULATIONBASED CONTROLS Populationbased control identify Motor Vehicle Administration ( MVA ) , match age ( year birth ) , race , gender geography case . We sample control proportion population size county residence . Recruitment control start concurrently case accrual , use age , race gender frequency distribution cancer patient previous year . The sampling frame continually update accrue information case distribution age , race gender . We exclude control list home phone number . The following check list use verify eligibility control subject . ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA POPULATIONBASED CONTROLS 1 . Resides Baltimore City , Anne Arundel , Baltimore , Caroline , Carroll , Cecil , Dorchester , Harford , Howard , Kent , Queen Anne , Somerset , Talbot , Wicomica Worchester County . 2 . Has residential work phone within his/her home 3 . Age great equal 18 year less equal 90 year 4 . Have never radiation therapy chemotherapy 5 .
