	<detailed_description>This study design measure incidence malaria attack 2-week follow-up period 2 population patient . First , index group ( IG , expose fever ) constitute schoolchildren attend school nursery fever diagnose malaria , base negative HRP2-based RDT . Second , control group ( CG , expose fever ) constitute apparently healthy schoolchildren pair index case gender , age , week inclusion malaria status ( ie : negative HRP2-based RDT ) . In pragmatic purpose , subject select inclusion malaria diagnosis make mean accessible clinician routine practice , i.e. , RDT body temperature assessment . During follow-up , malaria define association fever parasitemia , use malaria diagnostic method , whatever availability field : ( blood smear and/or PCR ) . Hence , primary objective study show apply algorithm management fever school set safe , way lead excessive number undiagnosed ( thus untreated ) malaria attack , compare number malaria attack two group ( expose non expose fever ) . The secondary objective compare malaria incidence child high risk malaria follow-up IG CG respectively . Children high risk malaria 2 group define detection Plasmodium falciparum infection enrollment , use sensitive diagnostic tool currently available ( i.e. , PCR ) . Based data literature , estimate 15 % proportion child attend fever negative RDT positive PCR malaria , assume proportion roughly apparently healthy child . Twenty-eight child high risk malaria group ( correspond to187 child group ) need detect 8 % difference proportion 2 group ( α = 0.05 β = 0.8 ) . Assuming maximum 5 % dropout rate , aim include minimum 200 child group . Study site : This study perform February June 2008 4 school , locate Allada , Southern-Benin , malaria transmission intense perennial . Altogether , 4 study school receive 2600 schoolchildren 5 years-old . Conduct study : Ethical clearance obtain Faculty Medicine ethic committee , Benin National University , Cotonou . Children attend school nursery , lead parents/guardians . Care provide child school participate study . Children IG include actively follow individual informed consent obtain ( within 24 hour initial visit ) parent guardian . Asymptomatic child screen CG gender , age , week inclusion . The first child negative RDT inform consent obtain , include CG . Asymptomatic child ( screen inclusion CG ) positive RDT advise quickly attend school nursery soon symptom malaria would appear . Children treat malaria within prior month include either group . All child examine study nurse . Children danger sign refer health centre . Children attend school nursery manage fever fever state ( tympanic temperature 37.8°C ) history fever precede 24 hour report . For schoolchild manage fever , RDT ( Paracheck® , ORCHID Diagnostics ) perform child give artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) RDT result positive , accord national guideline age group . At enrolment follow-up , medication antimalarial activity treatment non malarial illness avoid acceptable alternative available . Follow-up visit day 3 , 7 14 . A blood smear blood spot collect enrolment schedule visit . An additional blood spot pharmacological data collect 100 child group day 0 day 14 . When fever report and/or state follow-up visit , RDT perform . We estimate number undiagnosed P falciparum malaria enrolment , take account baseline data ( case P falciparum parasitemia &gt; 1000/µL ) follow-up data fever concomitant occurrence least one test ( include PCR ) positive P falciparum infection . Laboratory analysis : RDTs red study nurse , recommend manufacturer 15 minute perform . Microscopy examination do retrospectively ( patient manage accord RDT result term antimalarial prescription IG CG group assignment ) blind patient 's identity . DNA prepare blood collect day 0 last day follow-up , well occurrence fever follow-up . On day 0 day 14 100 first child group , whole blood sample filter paper spot dry room temperature . Using dried blood spot ( DBS ) , chloroquine ( monodesethylchloroquine ) quinine detect high pressure liquid chromatography UV detection 254 nm use ammonium acetate ( 40 mM , pH =5.5 ) /acetonitrile ( 85/15 % v/v ) . Statistics : Parametric test ( Pearson 's chi-square chi-square comparison crude rate ) non-parametric ( Fischer ) test use . A logistic regression PCR positivity enrollment perform , take account variable likely influence malarial status : gender , age , school , clinical status , declare bednet use .</detailed_description>
