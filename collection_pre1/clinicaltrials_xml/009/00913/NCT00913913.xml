	<brief_summary>Immune therapy , IL-2 , metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) design mobilize immune effector cell recognize destroy cancer . The investigator recently observe 50 % objective response rate ( 16 % CR ) mRCC patient treat autologous tumor lysate -dendritic cell ( DC ) -vaccine , IL-2 interferon alfa ( IFN ) . New agent inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) pathways demonstrate significant benefit mRCC patient well , rarely induce CRs . High blood VEGF associate poor response IL-2 cause tumor specific immune dysregulation . To test whether complementary mechanism immune activation disruption regulatory pathway enhance outcome investigator plan treat 24 mRCC patient phase II trial use bevacizumab , DC vaccine , IL-2 , IFN . Observations project use development novel cancer therapy , successful , decrease burden cancer public . The investigator propose determine 1 ) objective clinical response rate treatment progression free survival , 2 ) clinical autoimmune relate toxicity profile therapy , 3 ) treatment relate tumor-specific immune response relationship tumor-specific immune response objective clinical response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab , Autologous Tumor/DC Vaccine , IL-2 IFNα-2b Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All eligible patient receive total five treatment week , consist approximately 5 day . Prior therapy , patient undergo apheresis DC preparation . DC-Tumor vaccine frozen 90 % pool human AB serum/ 10 % DMSO use treatment Patients dose bevacizumab ( 10mg/kg , Genentech ) intravenously every two week begin four week prior first vaccine . Each treatment week include ultrasound guide intranodal DC-vaccine injection ( 1 X 107 cells/1mL ) , follow 5 day continuous intravenous infusion IL-2 ( 18 MiU/m2 , Novartis ) , three subcutaneous injection IFNa-2b ( 6 MiU , Schering -Plough Corp. ) ( every day ) . The first two treatment week , induction phase , separate 9 day rest . Three additional treatment week , maintenance phase , separate 23 rest day .</detailed_description>
