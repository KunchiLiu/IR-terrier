	<brief_summary>Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) due leg artery blockages result painful leg muscle , skin ulcer infection due poor blood flow . In severe form , treatment may amputation . Adult stem cell inject affected leg may cause new blood vessel formation improve blood flow . The purpose study determine feasibility safety inject adult stem cell leg muscle patient severe PAD , attempt improve blood flow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Adult Stem Cells Treat Patients With Severe Leg Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower extremity peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) common , debilitate potentially life-threatening illness . Obstructive PAD progress limb-threatening ischemia rest pain , ulcer , gangrene require amputation unless blood flow ischemic limb restore . Surgical revascularization option often limited artery small bypass . Patient co-morbidities also make surgical option risky . Percutaneous revascularization technique similarly limit small distal artery caliber , technical difficulty high restenosis rate . Amputation may treatment option non-healing ulcer gangrene . Direct intramuscular injection adult stem cell may result improve low extremity perfusion , symptomatic improvement limb salvage patient critical limb ischemia optimal conventional revascularization . This study aim demonstrate safety feasibility therapeutic approach .</detailed_description>
