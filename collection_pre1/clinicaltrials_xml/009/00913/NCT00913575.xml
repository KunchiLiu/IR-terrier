	<brief_summary>Background : Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common degenerative condition large weight-bearing joint , hip knee , well small hand joint . Current intervention patient OA limit symptomatic pain relief later total joint replacement ( TJR ) . While TJR improve function pain , fully restore function individual . A key factor functional outcome probably condition TJR surgery . However , study conclusively patient undergo TKR surgery . Objective : 1 . Primary endpoint : To study effect pre-surgery neuromuscular PT compare attention control program low extremity function measure Chair stand test ( observed function ) KOOS score ( report function ) . 2 . Secondary endpoint muscle strength , walk time mobility . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize patient undergo pre-surgery PT significantly quicker perform chair stand test report significant improvement KOOS 3 month surgery compare control . Methods : 80 patient wait list unilateral TKR randomize neuromuscular PT attention control group intervention single-blinded randomize controlled trial . Assessments baseline , 3 month surgery 12 month surgery . Intervention : The neuromuscular PT group receive minimum 8 maximum 24 training session ; patient , include control group , receive 4 session Knee School . Significance : Given demographic change increase older segment population rise absolute number TKRs . It therefore warrant study pre-surgery neuromuscular PT help patient get joint replacement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Due demographic change significant increase older segment population , recent estimate United States suggest rate TKR surgery rise exponentially next decade . A similar trend expect Switzerland mark increase absolute number TKR surgery . Today , patient wait TKR surgery Switzerland neither routinely participate active training program reduce pain improve function educational program increase cop skill surgery . The intervention group receive neuromuscular training well 4 session Knee OA School . Both offer group session separate control group . ) The neuromuscular training take place supervision experience physiotherapist , 2 session week 60 minute . The training program , base neuromuscular biomechanical principle , accord possibility patient . The training session consist three part : warming ( ergometer cycling ) , circuit program , cool ( walk , stretch , mobility ) . The circuit program comprise four exercise circle key element core stability , postural function , functional alignment , low extremity muscle strength , functional exercise . b ) The Knee School educational program take place three group session one individual follow-up session . Patients receive information : anatomy physiology knee ( first group session ) ; propose physical activity pain self-management ( second group session ) ; rehabilitation phase surgery ( third group session ) . The control group receive Knee School session without neuromuscular PT separate intervention group avoid interaction group .</detailed_description>
