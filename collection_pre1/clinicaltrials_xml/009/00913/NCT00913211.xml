	<brief_title>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) Promote Hand Recovery Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose research penetrate problem hemiparesis follow stroke . This problem devastate quality life thousand people year . The brain show remarkable ability reorganize certain condition , include stroke . Unfortunately , change maladaptive leave individual additional loss function beyond cause directly ischemic damage . Specifically , motor neuron ipsilesional ( stroke ) hemisphere survive stroke undergo loss excitability due exaggerate interhemispheric inhibition impose neuron contralesional ( non-stroke ) hemisphere transcallosal pathway . Fortunately , maladaptive reorganization reversible , even chronic stroke , forced-use forced-learning paradigm paretic limb . But postulate effectiveness behavioral training richly enhance combined electrophysiologic intervention also affect neural excitability . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) potent noninvasive way influence excitability brain . rTMS , low stimulation frequency , depress neural function . By stimulate contralesional motor cortex low frequency , thereby depress interhemispheric inhibition , net excitatory effect ( disinhibition ) induce upon ipsilesional motor cortex . Furthermore , show animal healthy human depressive effect stimulate hemisphere magnify precede low-frequency rTMS 6-hz `` priming '' rTMS . We call arrangement 6-Hz prim low-frequency rTMS . We contend combine 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS behavioral motor learn training unprecedented improvement recovery hemiparesis achieve . We recently demonstrate safety single treatment 6-Hz prim low-frequency rTMS stroke large gap knowledge still exist know effect serial treatment 6-Hz prim low-frequency rTMS combine motor learn training . Failure address gap perpetuates use conservative strategy stroke rehabilitation , may rob individual full possible recovery . Our long-term goal maximize motor recovery follow stroke . The objective proposal integrate excitability effect induce exogenously rTMS produce endogenously motor learn produce powerful yet safe interactive effect lead improved recovery hemiparesis . The central hypothesis serial treatment 6-Hz prim low-frequency rTMS combine motor learn train effective safe . Our research team uniquely qualify execute project 1 ) special training rTMS undertaken PI laboratory international leader rTMS , 2 ) participation leader consultant , 3 ) participation neuroscientist expertise stroke neuroplasticity consultant , 4 ) participation recognize expert cerebrovascular disease co-investigator , 5 ) conducting study University Minnesota 's General Clinical Research Center maximize protection patient , 6 ) inclusion Center Magnetic Resonance Research study brain reorganization . The specific aim project : Specific Aim # 1 . Determine efficacy use serial treatment 6-Hz prim low-frequency rTMS , isolation combination motor learn training , improve hand function stroke . Forty subject stroke ( partial movement weak hand , able walk 100 foot , able follow direction , history seizure , medical device metal incompatible mri ) randomly assign equal number one four treatment group : The rTMSonly group receive 5 treatment rTMS primary motor area ( M1 ) contralesional hemisphere consist 10 min . 6-Hz ( `` prim '' ) rTMS 90 % rest motor threshold interrupted 20 train 5-s duration 25-s interval train follow immediately 10 additional min . 1-Hz ( `` low-frequency '' ) rTMS continuously 90 % rest motor threshold . Treatments every day two week . The Trackonly group receive 5 treatment computerized finger track training every day two week . The rTMScombined group receive rTMS rTMSonly group alternate track train Trackonly group 5 day occur two-week period . The rTMSsham group receive rTMS procedure , include similar sound , magnetic stimulation occur . The four treatment 2x2 factorial design , rTMS track factor , allow estimation synergistic effect rTMS combine tracking . Behavioral gain paretic hand measure finger prehension/dexterity test , finger track accuracy , subject self rating examiner rating . The working hypothesis : 1. rTMScombined group show great improvement paretic hand function rTMSonly Trackonly group posttest one-month follow-up , 2. rTMSonly Trackonly group show great improvement rTMSsham group . Specific Aim # 2 . Explore neural mechanism associate 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS combine track training . Following treatment describe Aim # 1 , M1 excitability measure paired-pulse TMS test ipsilesional hemisphere . This test allow examination cortical inhibition excitation . In addition , brain reorganization associate voluntary activation measure functional MRI yield data volume signal intensity active voxels paretic finger track . The working hypothesis : 1. rTMScombined group show great increase cortical excitability brain reorganization ipsilesional hemisphere rTMSonly Trackonly group posttest one-month follow-up , 2. rTMSonly Trackonly group show great increase rTMSsham group . Specific Aim # 3 . Determine safety serial 6-Hz prim low-frequency rTMS treatment stroke . Associated treatment describe Aim # 1 , adverse effect measure observation seizure time treatment . Neurocognitive test measure mood , verbal comprehension , perceptual organization , work memory process speed . Also , finger track test measure motor control nonparetic hand . The working hypothesis : 1. five 6-Hz prim low-frequency rTMS treatment , give alone combination motor learn training , produce seizure activity serious adverse effect .</detailed_description>
