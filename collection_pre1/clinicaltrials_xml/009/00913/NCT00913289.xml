	<brief_title>Liver Regeneration Therapy Using Autologous Adipose Tissue Derived Stromal Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The population liver cirrhosis patient enormous Japan radical treatment liver transplantation . However , number give donor extremely limited . Mesenchymal stem cell capable differentiate mesodermal-lineage cell well endodermal-lineage cell hepatocytes . They reside mesenchymal tissue bone marrows well adipose tissue . The latter tissue relatively enrich mesenchymal stem cell compare bone marrow cell . In study , cirrhotic patient receive autologous adipose tissue derive stromal cell contain substantial number mesenchymal stem cell .</detailed_description>
