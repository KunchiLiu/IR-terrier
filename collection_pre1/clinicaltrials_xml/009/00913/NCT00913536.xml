	<brief_summary>This study design investigate whether daily image pelvis bladder use device call cone beam CT scanner help increase accuracy radiotherapy treatment . The cone beam CT scanner part radiotherapy treatment unit . The result study may allow patient future undergoing radiotherapy treatment bladder cancer 1 ) accurately direct treatment , 2 ) high dose radiation deliver tumour keep dos surround normal tissue low possible . This may allow eradication cancer minimize side effect treatment . This study consist two phase : Phase A Phase B . In Phase A , image collect analyzed confirm useful use cone beam machine daily Cone Beam CT Bladder ( Phase B ) treatment adjustment . In phase B , hope able use cone beam CT scan accurately direct radiotherapy treatment daily basis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cone beam compute tomography ( CT ) new technology allow acquisition 3-dimensional cross-sectional imaging patient position linear accelerator couch . Cone beam CT also provide 3D soft tissue volumetric data therefore important information daily interfraction movement deformation normal critical structure within pelvis . Visualization tumor use technology may also enhance additional placement fiducial marker around tumor bed ensure even accurate targeting . The aim study assess feasibility daily cone beam CT image guidance patient receive radiation therapy ( RT ) bladder cancer well document change size location bladder rectum entire course RT . This enable u explore technique radiation therapy base normal tissue avoidance model reduce treatment toxicity potentially dose escalation future .</detailed_description>
