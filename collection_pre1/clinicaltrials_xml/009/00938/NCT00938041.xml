	<brief_summary>This multicenter study determine response rate , complete response rate , duration response , time progression , time-to-treatment failure , safety , survival follow treatment Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody retreatment patient non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma previously respond duration response least 3 month Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody therapy . Patients undergo two phase study . In first phase , patient receive dosimetric dose unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody ( 450 mg ) follow Anti-B1 Antibody ( 35 mg ) radiolabeled 5 mCi Iodine-131 . Whole body gamma camera scan obtain dosimetric dose data three image time point use calculate patient-specific dose deliver desire total body dose radiotherapy . In second phase , patient receive therapeutic dose unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody ( 450 mg ) follow 35 mg Anti-B1 Antibody label patient-specific dose deliver desire whole body dose radiation . Patients treat thyroid block medication least 24 hour prior first infusion continue 14 day follow last infusion .</brief_summary>
