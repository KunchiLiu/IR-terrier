	<brief_title>Antenatal Vitamin D3 Dose-finding Safety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D deficiency common among pregnant non-pregnant Bangladeshi woman . The consequence vitamin D deficiency pregnancy unknown , increase evidence suggests may compromise fetal growth development immune system . We hypothesize vitamin D deficiency pregnant woman adverse effect newborn 's defense infectious disease early infancy , thus contribute high rate neonatal mortality South Asia . Randomized control trial antenatal vitamin D supplementation need test hypothesis . However , preliminary study first necessary establish safe efficacious dose vitamin D use trial . In proposed study , measure response 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentration ( biomarker vitamin D status ) oral vitamin D3 supplementation pregnant woman non-pregnant woman reproductive age . The goal establish safe , efficacious feasible weekly vitamin D supplementation regimen use future trial . Five group approximately 15 woman ( 3 group pregnant 2 group non-pregnant woman ; total 75 woman ) supplement follow closely 10 week ( non-pregnant woman ) delivery ( pregnant participant ) . The primary outcome change 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration follow vitamin D supplementation , safety parameter reflect calcium regulation ( serum albumin-adjusted calcium concentration urine calcium excretion ) fetal development .</detailed_description>
