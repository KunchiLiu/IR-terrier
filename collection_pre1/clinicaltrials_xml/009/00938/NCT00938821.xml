	<brief_title>Very Low Dose Caudal Morphine Postoperative Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Caudal anesthesia common technique epidural anesthesia child . Caudal anesthesia recommend surgical procedure low part body , include herniorrhaphies ; operation urinary tract , anus , rectum ; orthopedic procedure pelvic girdle low extremity . Many anesthetic agent use caudal anesthesia pediatric patient , lidocaine Bupivacaine common . The major problem associate technique limited duration analgesia unwanted motor blockade . Addition medication prolong analgesia single shot caudal block investigate . Several author mention special interest use opioid like morphine caudal block postoperative analgesia . When low dose morphine use , side effect low high dose morphine use . A large definitive study need compare low dose morphine via caudal administration caudal block without Opioid regard duration analgesia frequency side effect . We plan conduct chart review center pediatric patient go urological , orthopedic , general surgery procedure caudal block give compare effectiveness side effect low dose morphine caudal block without Opioid .</detailed_description>
