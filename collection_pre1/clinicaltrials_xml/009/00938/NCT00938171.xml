	<brief_title>Comparing Local Anesthesia With General Anesthesia Breast Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental clinical study show surgical trauma stress affect immune system include innate adaptive immune response . The break immune homeostasis might enhance tumor growth spread . Minimal invasive surgical procedure show beneficial patient term preserve good systemic immune function . Impaired cellular immunity general anesthesia significant undesirable effect tumor surveillance breast surgery . The local block technique might avoid surgery induce neuroendocrine , metabolic , cytokine response , offer advantage good preservation early postoperative cellular immune function attenuate disturbance inflammatory mediator . Our research focus effect local block anesthesia mediator may important inflammatory response , tumor cell dissemination , deposition , propagation early postoperative period . As importantly , local block method safe procedure also reduce need post operative opioids prevents nausea follow breast cancer result markedly reduce hospital stay health cost . It plausible inhibition surgical response local block anesthesia may attenuate perioperative tumor enhance factor and/or potential beneficial action lidocaine infiltration combine propofol sedation per se anticancer effect well cancer control .</detailed_description>
