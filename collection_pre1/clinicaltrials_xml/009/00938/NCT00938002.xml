	<brief_summary>Critically ill patient breathe machine risk develop type pneumonia call Ventilator Acquired Pneumonia ( VAP ) . The purpose study determine regular lung rinse send microbiological test reduce time diagnose VAP . The study also plan test accuracy speed new technology , use multiplexed automate digital microscopy , identify germ cause VAP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) common , life-threatening hospital-acquired infectious complication prolong mechanical ventilation ( MV ) . Despite aggressive effort prevent VAP , rate remain high clinical diagnosis imprecise microbiological diagnosis frequently delay . Diagnosis VAP depend clinical sign well microbiologic evidence Bronchioalveolar Lavage ( BAL ) culture . Ordinarily , culture order patient present clinical sign symptom VAP , significantly delay diagnosis effective therapy . This research propose implement additional surveillance BAL culture order reduce time diagnosis VAP mechanically ventilate critically ill adult . To reduce time diagnosis VAP , research aim test part BAL culture use novel flowcell/surface-capture device allows direct specimen visualization bacteria use multiplexed automate digital microscopy ( BACcel™ ) rapid bacterial identification antibiotic resistance test . Additionally , molecular assay BAL sample characterize low respiratory tract antimicrobial peptide host-innate immune molecule local anti-oxidant defense mechanically ventilate adult risk VAP .</detailed_description>
