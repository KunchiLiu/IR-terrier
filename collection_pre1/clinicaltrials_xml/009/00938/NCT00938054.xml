Medical , educational , treatment record review PDN branch clinician confirm diagnostic impression include detailed description child behavior support autism diagnosis 7 . The final decision meeting diagnostic treatment history inclusion criterion base PDN branch staff review case 8 . Treatment history : participant must receive adequate treatment intervention autism symptom . Participant medical treatment record carefully review ascertain treatment history 2 . Current functioning : . Parent report report least one professional child longer autistic 3 . At screen visit ( meet initial eligibility ) , meet criterion autism 1 . Must meet criterion autism per overall clinical impression base information collect administration ADOS , current ADIR symptom , clinical observation make assessment . 2 . Teacher/informant report autism symptom ( result SRS ) indicative autism diagnosis 3 . Minimum improvement symptom require group assignment : approximately 2 point CGI severity illness change ( equivalent ) base PDN impression change illness severity initial diagnosis ( estimate base review past medical record ) current functioning OR 4 . Current assessment functional impairment due autism symptom use standardized assessment measure Developmental DisabilityChildren Global Assessment Scale reflect adequate functioning area and/or clinically significant improvement functioning , consistent common psychiatric treatment definition treatment response 4 . Able participate study procedure . AUTISM Group : 1 . Diagnosis autism follow criterion describe 2 . Treatment history : study participant must receive adequate treatment intervention . Treatment history match treatment provide child REMAUT group . 3 . Screening visit ( meet initial eligibility ) : meet criterion autistic disorder use diagnostic process describe REMAUT group 4 .
