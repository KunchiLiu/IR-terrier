If change subject 's medication regimen require immediately prior study visit , subject reschedule later date . Eligibility determine principal investigator physician co-investigators base medical history obtain participant , medical record result laboratory test include medical record obtain health screen visit ) . Eligible subject contact see remain interested participate study . A study visit date schedule . All subject receive stipend health screening . Screening prior at-home dosing KI The main concern subject ask take KI morning prior study visit possibility patient allergic iodine thus reaction KI unobserved environment home . The research team identify subject know allergy advance screen subject ' medical record ( available ) health-history interview conduct via telephone study coordinator . Subjects sure iodine allergy eat shellfish never receive contrast dye , therefore , say sureness allergic exclude participation . Supplying KI tablet subject prior study visit The KI tablet supply study participant 2 day approximately 2 week prior study visit . The tablet instruction sheet mail subject supplied health screen visit Clinical Translational Research Center ( CTRC ) ; however , subject patient KBPC appointment physician within approximately 2 week study visit , member research team may provide KI tablet instruction sheet clinic visit . Otherwise , subject ask provide mail address phone interview ensure tablet send correct address . Per IosatTM package insert , tablet store dry place room temperature direct sunlight . Subjects also instruct keep tablet place someone else accidentally consume ( i.e. , child , spouse , etc ) . These storage technique convey subject include instruction . The tablet available individually wrap foil blister pack protect effect UV light , damage KI . To decrease likelihood damage tablet due improper storage handling , tablet package secondary pill bottle child-safe cap Tufts Medical Center pharmacy . Subjects instruct take KI tablet morning day study visit 6:00 AM 10:00 AM . Instructions tablet include : - An additional warning , bold typeface , instruct subject take tablet even suspect might iodine allergy . - Proper administration . Per package insert , tablet consume water , low fat milk , low fat chocolate milk , orange juice . - Symptoms allergic reaction step take event subject experience reaction ( per IosatTM package insert ) . In addition listing emergency phone number '911 ' package , contact number Dr. Stevens ( PI ) study coordinator include event subject question concern . On morning study visit , research staff ask subject give verbal confirmation take KI dose record approximate time subject take . Subjects take medication interfere creatinine , safely cease take medication , describe exclusion criterion , remind stop medication 1 week prior study visit time . In addition , member research team contact subject 2-3 day prior visit date ensure subject clear direction question concern . During call , subject remind take KI tablet specify time . When possible , study personnel also call subject approximately 9:00 AM morning day study visit ensure subject take tablet . Non-diabetic subject request fast overnight avoid change non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent medication block renin-angiotensin system . Subjects diabetes ask eat light breakfast morning study visit . Subjects ask maintain adequate oral hydration ingest two three glass non-caffeinated beverage prior arrival facilitate collection baseline urine collection additional two five glass upon arrival CTRC . Upon arrival morning study visit , nurse staff ask study subject provide verbal confirmation take KI pill document record study flow sheet approximate time subject take tablet . If pill take within allowed time range 6:00 AM 10:00 AM , subject able participate study visit . A research team member obtain informed consent participant copy consent give subject . The nursing staff measure record subject 's height , weight , blood pressure , temperature , pulse rate , respiration rate ; confirm subject experienced change physical/psychological health since screening ; collect baseline urine sample . As outline , three week elapse since health screening , woman childbearing age administer urine pregnancy test , prior insertion IV line , use aliquot baseline urine sample . The test kit use purchase local pharmacy site principal investigator delegate provide CTRC staff . Nursing interpret result test principal investigator verify negative result prior initiation GFR measurement . If test yield positive result , study visit immediately terminate . Subjects diabetes request bring test device . The CTRC test device subject forgets bring . Subjects ask check blood sugar upon arrival CTRC . If unable perform measurement , nurse . The study physician inform low ( less 100 mg/dl ) high ( great 200 ) blood sugar . Otherwise , participant follow normal routine checking blood sugar . For example , check meal , ask .

A saline lock intravenous line insert two different site two drop saturate solution potassium iodide ( SSKI ) administer least 30 minute six hour prior administration 125I-iothalamate prevent uptake thyroid . Baseline laboratory test include serum creatinine , cystatin C , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , electrolytes albumin . The marker administer prepared pharmacist Tufts Medical Center Pharmacy . The pharmacist prepare marker administer directly nurse . That , correct dose place syringe administer directly participant . A member research team obtain drug bring CTRC administration nurse . After collection baseline blood sample separate sample tissue banking ( optional ) , 50 mg Inulin/kg administer bolus IV , follow sustain dose 18.8 mg/square area/min . Approximately 30 minute later , 35 µCuries 125I-iothalamate inject subcutaneously allow 60 minute equilibrium time . After 30 minute , 5 ml Iohexol ( Omnipaque 300 , 300mg/mL organic iodine ) 10 uL/kg Gd-DTPA administer via bolus IV injection IV line inulin . Iohexol give first 1 minute , follow saline flush intravenous line , follow Gd-DTPA one minute . Subjects eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 , determine medical record serum creatinine measurement health screening , receive Gd-DTPA . The syrinx use administer iohexol Gd-DTPA weigh near tenth gram scale injection . Nurses CTRC monitor participant time administration throughout study . Blood sample plasma clearance measurement obtain second IV line , also remain place throughout course study visit . To maintain patency IV access purpose serial blood collection , normal saline administer rate approximately 20-30 c.c . per hour 500 c.c . bag normal saline . The administration inulin consider time 0 . Following iohexol administration , blood sample take approximately 10 , 30 , 120 , 240 minute second intravenous line . For participant estimate GFR le 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 , determine screen visit subject 's medical record , sample drawn 360 minute . The exact time sample record . Following 180-minute timed void , voluntary void collect volume oral fluid intake match urine output ( i.e . water load stop ) . The nursing staff continue monitor fluid balance . For urine sample , bladder scan conduct immediately immediately subject urinates ass completeness bladder empty . Following equilibration period inulin ( 90 minute ) 125I-iothalamate ( 60 minute ) , four time urinary clearance period least 30 minute begin . Blood sample urinary clearance measurement take follow bladder empty . Blood sample plasma clearance measurement take approximately 10 , 30 , 120 , 150 , 240 min . For patient estimate GFR &lt; 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 , additional blood sample collect 360 min . Subjects free move around GFR test . Participants feed breakfast consist standardized protein content follow collection 30 minute blood sample lunch similar protein content . Subjects diabetes give meal consistent treatment regimen ask administer medication check blood sugar level course study visit would normally , manner prescribe treat physician . At conclusion study , intravenous line remove . Subjects remain CTRC least 30 minute follow removal IV line . During time , nursing staff re-measure record subject 's vital sign ( height , weight , blood pressure , temperature , pulse rate , respiration rate ) . Upon successful completion study visit , subject receive stipend Subjects undergo repeat study visit target time one month visit .
