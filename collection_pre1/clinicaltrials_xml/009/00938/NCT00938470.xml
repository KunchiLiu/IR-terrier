	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well docetaxel , oxaliplatin , capecitabine , fluorouracil , radiation therapy work compare fluorouracil give together oxaliplatin radiation therapy treat patient cancer esophagus gastroesophageal junction spread start nearby tissue lymph node . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , oxaliplatin , capecitabine , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) together radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess compare pathologic complete response ( PCR ) rate patient Arm A receiving sequence docetaxel , oxaliplatin , capecitabine ( DOC ) follow 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , oxaliplatin , radiation therapy ( RT ) patient Arm B receive 5-FU , oxaliplatin RT patient potentially resectable adenocarcinoma ( ACA ) esophagus , gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) , gastric cardia . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess adverse event ( AE ) profile safety propose treatment population . II . To assess compare overall survival ( OS ) treatment arm . III . To assess compare disease-free survival treatment arm . IV . To assess compare clinical tumor response rate propose regiment administer surgery treatment arm . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . Patients also receive capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion second course , patient receive fluorouracil* IV continuously day 1-5 oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 , 15 , 29 . Patients also undergo radiotherapy** 5 day week 5.5 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Approximately 4-12 week completion radiotherapy , patient undergo surgery . ARM II : Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-5 oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 , 15 , 29 . Patients also undergo radiotherapy surgery Arm I . - NOTE : * Fluorouracil continuous IV infusion begin within 24 hour radiotherapy end within 24 hour radiotherapy completion . - NOTE : ** Radiotherapy begin within 2-6 week completion 2 course docetaxel , oxaliplatin , capecitabine . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
