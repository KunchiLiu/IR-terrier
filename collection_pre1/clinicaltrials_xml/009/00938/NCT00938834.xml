There several clinical trial drug commonly use treat neuropathic pain ( amitriptyline , gabapentin , pregabalin , acetaminophen/tramadol , duloxetine , minserin ) reporting degree efficacy treat fibromyalgia . This efficacy make practical consider fibromyalgia along neuropathic pain condition . However , drug trial report partial efficacy relieve pain and/or symptom . Current treatment recommendation indicate need multimodal approach ; include medical management use appropriate drug therapy , psychological therapy , exercise complementary approach . The current proposal randomize control trial compare qigong ( complementary modality ) wait list control determine qigong useful complementary therapy fibromyalgia . The investigator recently complete pilot trial examine specific form qigong ( CFQ Qigong , available locally Halifax ) , observed beneficial effect pain , fibromyalgia impact , quality life score ; importantly , benefit sustain 6 month end trial . On basis preliminary observation , investigator propose control trial CFQ Qigong compare wait list control group . The latter group offer qigong train end trial , could really characterize delayed treatment group . The study consist 3-day training period , weekly review technique session 8 week , daily practice 8 week , assessment baseline , 8 week follow training practice , follow-up assessment 4 6 month . Study outcomes include : ( ) pain ( numeric rating scale - pain intensity ) , ( b ) impact ( fibromyalgia impact questionnaire ) , ( c ) quality life measure ( SF-36 ) , ( ) patient assessment ( patient global impression change satisfaction scale ) , ( e ) sleep measure ( Pittsburgh sleep quality index , actigraphy , sleep diary ) . In addition assessment , investigator also conduct qualitative assessment participant provide open-ended assessment health status interval . The main hypothesis examine CFQ Qigong produce benefit compare wait list group .</brief_summary>
