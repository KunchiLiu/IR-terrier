	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This phase I/II , dose-escalation study . Phase I : Patients undergo either percutaneous placement metallic fiducial marker within liver respiratory-correlated cone-beam compute tomography stereotactic target planning . Patients undergo single-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy approximately 1 hour within 1 week marker placement . Phase II : Patients undergo treatment phase I maximum tolerated dose . After completion study treatment , patient follow week 4 12 every 3 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
