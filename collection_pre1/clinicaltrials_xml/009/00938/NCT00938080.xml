	<brief_title>Study Assess Safety Tolerability AG013 Oral Mucositis Subjects Receiving Induction Chemotherapy Treatment Cancers Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate safety tolerability AG013 subject risk oral mucositis ( OM ) assess clinical efficacy AG013 reduction sign symptom OM patient receive induction chemotherapy treatment head neck cancer . AG013 make genetically modify ( GM ) bacteria call Lactococcus lactis ( L. lactis ) . Wild type L. lactis commonly use produce dairy product include cheese milk . To make AG013 , DNA L. lactis change laboratory secrete protein call human Trefoil Factor 1 ( hTFF1 ) . hTFF1 normally secrete saliva intestine . Trefoil factor show important protect heal mucosal tissue , tissue mouth , tissue damage cancer therapy chemotherapy radiation therapy . The proposed Phase 1b clinical trial enroll subject head neck cancer develop OM first cycle treatment induction chemotherapy . OM painful , common toxicity many form drug radiation therapy use treatment cancer . Subjects OM get soreness , irritation , ulcer mouth may difficulty eat , drink swallow result cancer treatment . During second cycle induction chemotherapy , eligible subject receive AG013 placebo 14 consecutive day frequency one rinse , three rinse six rinse per day ( sequential dose escalation design ) . At least 21 subject enrol study . For three daily dose level , 5 subject assign AG013 ( n=5 ) 2 subject assign placebo ( n=2 ) . Throughout study , safety monitor collect record Adverse Events , laboratory assessment presence sAGX0085 bacteria blood . An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) constitute enrollment subject order review safety data enrollment group .</detailed_description>
