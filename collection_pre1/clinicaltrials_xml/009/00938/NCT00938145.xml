	<brief_title>3 Tesla MRI Patients With Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate whether 3 Tesla MRI accurately determine primary tumor ( T ) stage pelvic lymph node ( N ) stage patient localized bladder cancer compare histopathology stag . Secondary - To determine whether 3 Tesla MRI determine primary bladder tumor respond neoadjuvant chemotherapy mid-point plan treatment ( 2 course ) . - To assess whether ex-vivo ultra-high-field MRI ( 4.7-11.7 Tesla ) tissue scan accurately determine clinical stage primary bladder tumor local extent disease ( i.e. , involvement contiguous organ regional lymph node ) compare histopathology stag . OUTLINE : Patients may receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( typically four 21-day course cisplatin-based therapy ) follow standard radical cystectomy lymph node dissection . Patients undergo 3 Tesla MRI scan baseline stage primary tumor , regional lymph node , rule distant sit disease . The MRI include diagnostic high-resolution anatomical image ( e.g. , T1-weighted T2-weighted image along axial optimal direction ) experimental image include functional MRI ( e.g. , dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI , diffusion-weighted MRI , MR spectroscopy , chemical exchange-dependent saturation-transfer imaging ) . Patients also undergo 3 Tesla MRI scan 2 course neoadjuvant chemotherapy completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy undergo 3 Tesla MRI scan 2-4 week radical cystectomy lymph node dissection . Specimens radical cystectomy pelvic lymph node dissection examine ex-vivo ultra-high-field MRI Micro-Imaging Specimen Study Form complete . The specimen examine pathology department per standard routine .</detailed_description>
