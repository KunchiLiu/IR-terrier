	<brief_title>Postprandial Effects Walnut Components Versus Whole Walnuts Cardiovascular Disease ( CVD ) Risk Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Walnuts contain high content polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) , particularly linoleic acid linolenic acid . The high PUFA content suggest reduce CVD risk decrease total LDL-cholesterol concentration , increase HDL-C concentration . In addition , walnuts rich substance ellagic acid ( polyphenol ) , antioxidant , vitamin E , fiber , essential fatty acid , flavanoids , phenolic acid . Polyphenolic compound believe multiple biological effect influence oxidative stress , platelet function , inflammation , cancer initiation propagation . There interest identify food favorable compound test efficacy real world setting understand role human diet . Despite positive benefit find consumption walnut , know specific component walnut ( i.e. , whole walnut , walnut skin , defatted walnut , walnut oil ) beneficial health . The investigator hypothesize maximum improvement oxidative stress , inflammatory marker , platelet endothelial function observe follow consumption whole nut versus isolate walnut component , thereby lead recommendation consume walnut . In addition , result research propose provide new information antioxidant , inflammatory , platelet activity endothelial effect different walnut component synergistic effect component postprandial state .</detailed_description>
