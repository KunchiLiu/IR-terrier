	<brief_summary>Rationale : The drug etomidate cause increase mortality use continuous sedation mechanically ventilated patient ; however , etomidate continue widely use single-bolus induction agent endotracheal intubation favorable hemodynamic property . Recent data raise question regard safety use etomidate even single bolus patient risk adrenal insufficiency , emphasize fact single bolus dos etomidate cause measurable adrenal suppression , consequently may cause increase vasopressor requirement hospital length stay . Alternative FDA-approved induction agent , midazolam , may safer etomidate ; however , study formally compare agent . Research Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize critically ill trauma patient present emergency department require rapid sequence intubation , hospital length stay patient give etomidate great patient give midazolam induction . Specific Aims : The specific aim determine difference hospital length stay trauma patient give etomidate give midazolam induction rapid sequence intubation emergency department . The investigator plan compare two group term hospital length hospital stay , length stay intensive care unit , duration intubation perform prospective , randomize , trial critically ill trauma patient present emergency department require intubation . The investigator also compare mortality rate two group control severity illness use steroid hospitalize . Significance : If use etomidate induce anesthesia prior intubation adversely affect hospital length stay trauma patient , length stay might reduce patient use alternative agent induction . Since etomidate currently widespread use induction agent , result study could significant implication patient management .</brief_summary>
