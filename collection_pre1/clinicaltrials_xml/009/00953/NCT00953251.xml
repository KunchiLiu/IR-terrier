	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : We seek determine diagnostic value new TnThs assay early detection evolve non-STEMI patient acute coronary syndrome negative 4th generation cTnT result admission . METHODS : We evaluate several statistical pattern blood result TnT hs cTnT 115 patient calculated necessity prediction evolve non-STEMI within 6 hour . RESULTS : Based result 4th generation cTnT assay , evolve non-STEMI diagnosed 26 patient , 31 classify unstable angina . The TnThs lead increase non-STEMI diagnosis compare 4th generation assay . We could calculate increased sensitivity earlier detection evolve non-STEMI 61.5 % admission 90.9 % within 3 hour 100 % within 6 hour compare cTnT . CONCLUSIONS : The TnThs assay enables earlier detection non-STEMI allow identification additional percentage case non-STEMI previously classify unstable angina .</brief_summary>
