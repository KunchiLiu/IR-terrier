	<brief_summary>Blood clot abnormality problem happen surgery ? even minor surgery ? serious possibility serious bleeding stop . The current standard practice people clot abnormality transfuse additional blood surgery , effort decrease bleed problem . However , transfuse blood surgery effective decrease bleed complication . In addition , may associate complication , include fluid buildup swell lung . For study , person mild clot problem define one INR ( International Normalized Ratio ) 1.5 3 . Severe clot defined INR great 3 . This study aim test limit restrict transfusion patient severe clot problem ( INR great 3 ) result few transfusion problem fewer unnecessary transfusion comparison current , liberal , transfusion use patient mild severe clot problem ( INR great 1.5 ) .The investigator also determine liberal blood transfusion decrease risk bleed surgical procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is Plasma Transfusion Beneficial Prior Low-Risk Procedures Hospitalized Patients With Blood Clotting Abnormalities ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While restrictive red cell transfusion practice become standard care acutely ill , data use fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) limit . FFP transfusion may poorly effective prevention bleed complication associate significant complication . In retrospective cohort critically ill non-surgical patient abnormal international normalize ratio ( INR ) , observe significant variability practice FFP transfusion . Rather benefit liberal use , adverse effect observe , particular pulmonary edema acute lung injury . Our overall goal improve safety blood product transfusion prevent pulmonary complication . Here propose randomized clinical trial restrictive ( INR 1.6-3 ) versus liberal ( FFP transfusion keep INR &lt; 1.6 ) FFP transfusion prior commonly perform invasive procedure ( thoracocentesis , abdominal paracentesis central venous cannulation ) . We use follow outcome measure compare difference two group : 1 . New onset pulmonary edema ; 2 . Postprocedural bleeding complication ; 3 . Number blood product transfusion ; 4 . Hospital mortality 5 . Length intensive care unit hospital stay . The result study form basis future multicenter clinical trial implication worldwide transfusion practice .</detailed_description>
