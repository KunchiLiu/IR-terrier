	<detailed_description>Introduction : Asthma chronic respiratory disorder primarily drive increase airway inflammation . It one prevalent chronic condition affect Canadians . It common chronic illness affect child fourth common disorder affect adult . In 2001 , nearly 2.2 million ( 8.4 % ) Canadians diagnose asthma . More importantly , asthma escalate medical problem Canada , e.g. , 1994 2001 , 40 % increase number Canadians asthma . Not prevalence asthma increase , rapid rise morbidity cost associate asthma poor control . The WHO estimate global cost care asthma exceeds AIDS/HIV tuberculosis combine . Though recent guideline emphasize importance improve asthma control quality life , lead huge amount resource dedicate , 50 % adult patient asthma remain poorly control . As current treatment strategy appear fail , important target simple , cost effective intervention applicable patient asthma increase overall level control decrease asthma morbidity . There evidence suggest aerobic exercise may improve asthma symptom control child . In addition , evidence exercise directly improve inflammatory immune profile non-asthma patient , may provide mechanism exercise could improve asthma . However , know study systematically assessed effect aerobic exercise asthma control , quality life immune function adult asthma population . Objective : The primary objective current application ass efficacy aerobic exercise intervention improve asthma control quality life adult patient asthma . The result study provide data inform physicians member Thoracic community benefit exercise asthma . The study also assess potential inflammatory pathway exercise may elicit improvement asthma morbidity . The result study available next Canadian Thoracic Society Canadian Adult Consensus Guidelines . Methodology : The current proposal study aerobic exercise sedentary patient poorly control asthma . In addition usual care , 52 patient undertake supervise aerobic exercise . The exercise program consist 3 X 1hr session supervise exercise per week 12 week . The exercise routine , medical supervision , consist 10 minute warm exercise , 40 minute bike and/or walking ( eventually jog ) , 10 minute cool exercise . These patient compare group 52 patient follow usual regimen , group offer exercise programme complete post assessment . For primary outcome ( asthma control [ Asthma Control Questionnaire ] , quality life [ Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire ] ) secondary outcome ( inflammatory profile ) evaluate baseline 12 week ( length treatment ) . To check efficacy intervention lung function , ambulatory peak flow , exercise tolerance data also collect . Repeated measure analysis covariance-type model time ( pre , post intervention ) within subject factor , group ( exercise , usual care ) factor , sex , age , asthma severity covariates use primary outcome variable . To assess potential mechanistic role inflammation exercise-asthma relationship series regression-like GLMs conduct . It hypothesize : ( 1 ) The exercise intervention result clinically statistically significant improvement level asthma control asthma quality life ; ( 2 ) The exercise intervention result clinically statistically significant improvement inflammatory profile , reduction Th2 cytokine , activation inflammatory cell , increase Th1 cytokine ; ( 3 ) Changes inflammatory profile directly link improvement asthma measure . We believe proposal great clinical significance patient management . This project first systematically evaluate benefit exercise train asthma control quality life adult asthma patient . We anticipate result study form basis new national international guideline provide evidence-based background physician prescribe aerobic exercise patient asthma .</detailed_description>
