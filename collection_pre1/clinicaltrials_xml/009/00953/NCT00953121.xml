	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Bevacizumab , CPT-11 Carboplatin combination effective treatment recurrent malignant glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Plus Irinotecan Plus Carboplatin Recurrent Malignant Glioma ( MG )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three cohort accrue assess independently . Each cohort evaluate separate malignant glioma subpopulation . Cohort A assess recurrent glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) subject previously fail either bevacizumab , irinotecan carboplatin . Cohort B ass recurrent grade 3 malignant glioma subject previously fail either bevacizumab , irinotecan carboplatin . Cohort C ass recurrent GBM subject fail prior bevacizumab therapy fail prior irinotecan carboplatin . The primary endpoint cohort 6-month progression-free survival . This study conduct The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center Duke . For cohort , bevacizumab administer 10 mg/kg irinotecan every week . The dose irinotecan 125 mg/m2 subject Cytochrome P450 , family 3 , subfamily A ( CYP3A ) -inducing anti-epileptics ( EIAEDs ) 340 mg/m2 subject EIAEDs . All subject also receive carboplatin day 1 28-day treatment cycle . Carboplatin dose achieve area curve ( AUC ) 4 . Within 2 week start study , subject 's medical history current medical condition record . A physical examination include vital sign ( temperature , respiratory rate , blood pressure , pulse ) , height weight , neurological examination do . Subject ask ability perform everyday task . Blood test assessment complete blood count include monitor liver kidney function urine test check kidney function perform . For woman childbearing potential , blood test rule pregnancy do prior start treatment . Blood test also check specific gene , may affect much irinotecan subject give . A magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) perform within 2 week start study drug well every eight week determine response progression . In total , approximately 3 teaspoon ( 15 mL ) blood drawn evaluation start study drug . These test repeat every 8 week ( blood chemistry ) , except complete blood count ( approximately 1 teaspoon ) , need repeat every week well deem clinically necessary repeat . Every 4 week urine test perform test amount protein subject 's urine . Placement central venous line may require . Subjects see clinic physical neurological examination every four ( 4 ) week . Urine blood laboratory test also obtain visit . In addition , complete blood count ( 1 teaspoon ) obtain every week . Blood pressure measurement require every 2 week . MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) scan do every 8 week ( every 2 cycle ) determine effectiveness study drug . If tumor remain size small , subject continue receive study drug 12 cycle unless bad side effect unless evidence drug work . If evaluation show may persistent tumor 12 cycle , subject may continue treatment . Study drug stop subject 's tumor get large . Additional test may do discretion doctor part regular care throughout study . These exams test do monitor effect study intervention .</detailed_description>
