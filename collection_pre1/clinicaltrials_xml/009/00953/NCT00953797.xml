	<brief_summary>High Blood Pressure Hypertension one main cause stroke , heart disease , heart attack kidney disease . Traditionally physicians use diet lifestyle change medication control patient 's blood pressure . There however , patient whose blood pressure difficult control blood pressure remain elevated despite multiple medication . When blood pressure remain goal ( great 140/90 great 130/80 mmHg patient diabetes kidney disease ) despite 3 blood pressure medication , investigator call `` Resistant Hypertension '' . Enhanced External Counterpulsation ( EECP ) new method treatment currently use people heart disease chest pain . EECP therapy use three set balloon like cuff wrap calf , low thigh , upper thigh . These cuff inflate deflate every heart beat , cause increase blood return heart well blood flow . It also find improve function endothelial cell , type cell line wall blood vessel body help regulate maintain blood pressure . This lead u believe EECP therapy , although use present treat patient Resistant Hypertension , may useful decrease blood pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Enhanced External Counterpulsation ( EECP ) Therapy Patients With Resistant Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension major cause contributor stroke , heart kidney disease could worsen progression well . Despite major reduction age-adjusted death rate coronary heart disease stroke , continue lead third common cause death , respectively , United States . In particular , every 20 mm Hg increase systolic blood pressure 10 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure , double stroke coronary artery disease death rate . Kidney Failure related hypertension continue grow , especially among African-American population . Traditional approach mostly include pharmaceutical target different mechanism contribute HTN . However , adequate control Blood pressure continue remain major problem . Resistant hypertension define blood pressure remain goal spite concurrent use three antihypertensive agent different class . Ideally , one three agent diuretic agent prescribe optimal dose amount . Patients whose blood pressure control require four medication consider resistant treatment . The prevalence resistant hypertension unknown . Cross- sectional study hypertension outcome study suggest , however , uncommon . In recent analysis National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) participant treat hypertension , 53 % control &lt; 140/90 mm Hg . In cross-sectional analysis Framingham Heart Study participant , 48 % treated participant control &lt; 140/90 mm Hg le 40 % elderly participant ( &gt; 75 year age ) goal blood pressure . The benefit successful treatment , however , likely substantial suggest hypertension outcome study general early Veterans Administration cooperative study , demonstrate 96 % reduction cardiovascular event 18 month use triple antihypertensive regimen compare placebo patient severe hypertension ( diastolic blood pressure 115 129 mm Hg ) . Furthermore , age obesity two common risk factor hypertension prevalence likely increase patient population get old heavier . This necessitate development novel therapeutic approach blood pressure control . Enhanced External Counterpulsation ( EECP ) non-invasive method currently use treatment ischemic coronary disease . During EECP therapy three compressive pneumatic cuff wrap calf , low thigh , upper thigh . The cuff inflate sequentially diastole cause retrograde aortic flow , increase venous return . During end diastole , cuff rapidly deflate , result unloading left ventricle decrease systolic blood pressure . In addition also evidence EECP improve endothelial function . Endothelial dysfunction imbalance vasodilatory vasoactive substance think contribute elevate blood pressure . This lead u believe EECP , although use present patient Resistant HTN , may represent novel , valuable untapped therapy . We propose study effect EECP therapy mean ambulatory blood pressure noninvasive hemodynamics subject Resistant HTN . We measure subject ' ambulatory blood pressure noninvasive hemodynamics parameter baseline , 4 week 7 week . Subjects undergo 7 week course ( 35 session ) EECP therapy . Follow ambulatory BP non invasive hemodynamic parameter measure evaluate change BP . Our hypothesis patient Resistant HTN demonstrate improve Blood pressure completion 35 session EECP therapy .</detailed_description>
