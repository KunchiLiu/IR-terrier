	<brief_summary>Patients heart failure increase risk thiamin deficiency ( TD ) , many reason malnutrition use diuretic drug . Thiamin B vitamin play important role production energy body . Therefore , low level thiamin may limit amount energy available heart pump blood . Recent thiamin supplementation trial demonstrate significant improvement heart function . However , clinically important , result study limit small sample size , indirect measurement thiamin status reliance hospitalize patient . Therefore , investigator ' goal determine prevalence thiamin deficiency ambulatory patient heart failure direct measurement thiamin red blood cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Prevalence Thiamin Deficiency Ambulatory Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thiamin water-soluble B-complex vitamin supply primarily cereal enrich grain ordinary diet . The majority absorb thiamin combine ATP body form thiamin pyrophosphate ( TPP ) . TPP coenzyme involve number energy production reaction body ( metabolism carbohydrates amino acid ) . Therefore , theoretically , TD reduce release metabolic energy tissue . The adverse effect TD include biventricular myocardial failure , tachycardia , peripheral edema , retention sodium occur result heart failure . Therefore , assumption TD CHF patient may result depletion cellular energy subsequently impair cardiac function . Previous study do CHF patient TD find thiamin supplementation associate improvement heart contractility . Patients heart failure increase risk TD , many reason malnutrition , anorexia use diuretic drug , furosemide . Several study demonstrate high prevalence TD hospitalize patient heart failure , range 13 % 91 % depend population study . This wide variation due difference underlie nutrition status subject , concurrent use medication include loop diuretic , severity disease , measurement technique use assessment thiamin status . These study however , clinically important , limited small sample size indirect measurement thiamin status . Also , study focus exclusively hospitalized patient , whereas ambulatory HF patient receive little attention . Therefore , primary objective conduct prospective , cross-sectional study investigate prevalence thiamin deficiency large group ambulatory patient heart failure use High-Performance Liquid Chromatography ( HPLC ) . This method many advantage include high level recovery ( 102 % average ) , high intra- inter-day precision within 5-9 % , well considerably low elution time 15 min . Our secondary objective conduct trial use oral thiamin supplement alone three practical dos order estimate minimum dose oral thiamin require effectively replete tissue store . We also hypothesize oral thiamin supplementation reduce neurohormonal stimulation ( NE , BNP , well oxidative stress ( F2-Isoprostanes ) . Therefore , study provide critical data prevalence TD ambulatory patient HF well define factor predictive TD population . Furthermore , study determine effective dose oral thiamin supplementation restore red blood cell thiamin level . Determining effective dose justify choice thiamin supplementation future study guide clinician recommend thiamin supplementation patient heart failure community .</detailed_description>
