	<detailed_description>Heart failure become one major epidemic modern era . Despite optimal standard drug therapy , prognosis patient heart failure remain poor . It note 15 % HF patient 30 % NYHA class III IV HF intraventricular conduction delay , QRS duration &gt; 120 m , commonly manifest LBBB . These electrical disturbance result LV dyssynchrony , see paradoxical septal wall motion activity , suboptimal ventricular fill mitral regurgitation ; thus compromise already dysfunctioning leave ventricle . Ventricular dyssynchrony associate increased mortality patient heart failure . Based observation , technique develop correct dyssynchrony . Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) show improve subjective objective parameter heart failure patient QRS duration &gt; 120msec . However , group heart failure patient respond CRT . Also note approximately 30 % heart failure patient QRS duration &gt; 120 msec actual mechanical dyssynchrony tissue doppler imaging . The electromechanical discrepancy ventricular dyssynchrony suggest possible explanation lack response . Also , heart failure patient normal QRS duration mechanical dyssynchrony . These finding bring emphasis importance mechanical dyssynchrony electrical dyssynchrony , measure QRS duration surface EKG . There many different modality quantify mechanical dyssynchrony . The commonly use method tissue doppler imaging ( TDI ) . TDI measure velocity myocardial tissue time maximal velocity . Then , use describe contraction different wall segment . Strain strain rate sophisticate way measure active segment contraction rather passive movement . We propose investigate change dyssynchrony relation intravascular volume status exercise heart failure patient . We also propose examine dyssynchrony set acutely decompensated heart failure . The change dyssynchrony follow examine translates clinical significance .</detailed_description>
