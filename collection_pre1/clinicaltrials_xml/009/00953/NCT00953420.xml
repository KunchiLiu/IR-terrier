	<brief_summary>Patients type cancer call nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) either come back go away best know standard treatment . Most patient respond chemotherapy NPC tumor come back treat platinum-based medication like cisplatin . However , since many patient give cisplatin initial treatment NPC , study , treat another platinum-based chemotherapy medicine use patient NPC call carboplatin . In study , carboplatin use combination another drug call docetaxel . Other study patient advanced head neck cancer show docetaxel cause tumor respond well allow patient survive longer add standard treatment disease . Some patient NPC show evidence infection virus cause infectious mononucleosis , know Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) , time cancer diagnosis . EBV find cancer cell almost patient advanced stage disease , suggest may play role cause NPC . Previously , patient treat high-risk NPC use EBV-specific cytotoxic T cell . These cell grow laboratory taught recognize attack EBV infect cell . In past , patient either give cell alone receive medication briefly lower white blood cell count . In case , many patient tumor shrink case completely disappear treat EBV-specific cytotoxic T cell . Investigators decide look patient NPC tumor respond treatment combination chemotherapy EBV-CTL . Patients ask participate study since NPC tumor associate EBV either come back responded standard treatment . This combination chemotherapy EBV-CTLs investigational treatment approve Food Drug Administration . The purpose study see relapsed refractory , EBV-associated NPC tumor respond treat carboplatin docetaxel follow EBV-CTL .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A blood sample obtain start make CTLs patient begin chemotherapy . The patient EBV-specific T cell grown patient treat chemotherapy give back patient chemotherapy complete . To prepare CTLs , 10-60 cc blood take patient . The amount blood collect depend size weight , 3 cc blood per kg body weight collect one time . This blood use grow EBV-infected B-cell line T-cell line . B cell T cell type white blood cell help fight infection body . After grow T cell laboratory , cell stimulate EBV infect B cell . The B cell treat radiation grow ; however , provide stimulation train T cell recognize kill EBV infected cell . The generation EBV-CTL require use special cell line , call lymphoblastoid cell line , make blood infect cell EBV . Once LCLs make , T cell repeatedly stimulate LCLs make EBV-CTL . The CTLs test make sure kill EBV infected cell give back patient . If number CTLs produce low , investigator may need obtain additional blood sample make cell . Because patient cell grown laboratory , blood take test infectious virus hepatitis HIV patient also fill questionnaire give standard blood donor . EXPECTED LENGTH OF STUDY The chemotherapy treatment portion study may last approximately 18 week . The length time patient receive treatment study depend well chemotherapy treatment work . If patient able complete least 4 cycle chemotherapy EBV-CTL ready infusion , cell give back patient . The infusion T cell last 10 minute patient pretreated one dose Tylenol Benadryl . The patient another disease re-evaluation 8 week first EBV-CTL injection . Based upon patient 's response first infusion , patient may receive extra dos cell available . These would give every 1.5-3 month . If patient additional injection cell , require additional disease re-evaluation 8 week infusion . To learn way EBV-CTLS working long last body , 10-60 ml blood take infusion . Up 40 ml blood also draw cycle chemotherapy occur Week 1 , Week 4 , Week 7 , Week 10 T cell infusion Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 8 week infusion , follow-up visit 5 , 8 , 11-12 month infusion . This blood use look immune response patient 's cancer . If patient one EBV-CTL infusion , 108 teaspoon blood drawn allow evaluation response treatment ; however , total amount blood collect study depend total number EBV-CTL infusion patient . The patient his/her response therapy follow least 1 year treatment study end . STUDY TREATMENT While cell grown , patient start chemotherapy order shrink size and/or amount his/her tumor . The patient treat combination docetaxel carboplatin chemotherapy . The chemotherapy give outpatient several hour . Docetaxel cause body hold extra fluid ( fluid retention ) . This side effect prevent people take small steroid dose docetaxel give . Therefore , night morning chemotherapy start , patient take steroid call dexamethasone mouth . Once patient get clinic , he/she give dose docetaxel dose carboplatin . Each medication give vein IV place central line . The patient take last dose dexamethasone go bed night . The patient receive chemotherapy treatment every 21 day long patient 's blood count laboratory test return acceptable level . The patient re-evaluation his/her disease image scan laboratory test second round chemotherapy . If patient 's tumor get bad and/or severe side effect chemotherapy , patient treat 2 4 additional round chemotherapy wait EBV-CTLs finished . The combination chemotherapy agent use study might cause patient 's white blood cell low . If low long period time patient develop serious infection low , her/she may give extra medication call Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( GCSF ) . GCSF help stimulate production white blood cell . However , anticipated people study require GCSF . Once EBV-CTLs ready patient recover last round chemotherapy , EBV-CTL infusion schedule . The CTL infusion take place either Houston Methodist Hospital Texas Children 's Hospital . The CTL infusion take less 10 minute , patient typically monitor 4 hour infusion make sure he/she reaction cell . END OF TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP The patient number test procedure part follow treatment . These test use watch improvement tumor size , monitor side effect treatment , evaluate T cell work , look sign cancer come back . The patient 's physical exam standard lab test , include blood test , image study every 3 month first year treatment .</detailed_description>
