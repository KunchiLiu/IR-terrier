	<detailed_description>This eighteen week study include two week taper period . Forty five subject start 10mg escitalopram titered 20mg plus placebo . After 10 week treatment , subject respond escitalopram , define 50 % reduction MADRS score , start adjunctive aripiprazole 2mg , titered 10mg . Subjects remain escitalopram aripiprazole 6 week . At week 10 prior start adjunctive aripiprazole week 16 ( end treatment ) subject receive PET MRI scan . The neuroimaging consist fMRI , raclopride PET scan , fluoro-dopa PET scan . Ten normal control subject undergo one set scan ( fMRI , raclopride FOPA PET scan ) use comparison group .</detailed_description>
