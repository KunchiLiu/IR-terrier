	<brief_summary>Rapid sequence intubation use , elevate risk aspiration lung stomach content . It typically use acute setting require acute surgery prehospital setting , also specific risk patient require elective surgery . The reason conduct rapid sequence intubation minimize risk pulmonary aspiration time achieve fast induction anaesthesia intubation . Rapid sequence intubation procedure high risk complication . The time period induction anaesthesia intubation particularly risky , patient apneic . This study address problem investigating , quickly spontaneous respiration reestablish rapid sequence intubation use Rocuronium-Sugammadex compare Succinylcholine . This pilot protocol intend establish sample size full protocol . Study hypothesis : The time correct tube placement spontaneous respiration shorter use Rocuronium/Sugammadex compare Succinylcholine .</brief_summary>
