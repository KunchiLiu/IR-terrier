	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safety give ketoconazole , hydrocortisone dutasteride ( KHAD ) lapatinib . The investigator believe evidence castrate resistant prostate cancer two growth factor receptor ( EGFr Her 2 /neu ) increase prostate cancer cell . Both receptor turn drug lapatinib . By add lapatinib trial , investigator hope investigator turn signal receptor therefore make participant 's cancer responsive KHAD treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- For initial four week study , participant receive drug ketoconazole , dutasteride hydrocortisone daily ( KHAD treatment ) . Ketoconazole take orally three time day , hydrocortisone take orally twice day dutasteride take orally day . - During 3rd 4th week KHAD treatment participant undergo CT-guided bone biopsy . - After completion 4 week KHAD treatment , participant start take lapatinib along KHAD start week 5 . Lapatinib take orally day . - During 3rd 4th week KHAD Lapatinib ( KHLAD ) treatment , participant undergo CT-guided bone biopsy .</detailed_description>
