	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sunitinib malate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well sunitinib malate work treat patient small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Treating Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess therapeutic activity sunitinib malate patient either chemonaïve extensive stage sensitive relapse small cell lung cancer . Secondary - To characterize safety sunitinib malate patient . Tertiary - To determine potential FDG-PET-scan serve surrogate marker response antiangiogenic activity compound . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease stage ( chemonaïve extensive stage v sensitive relapse least 3 month stop chemotherapy ) . Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography chest week 4 . Blood sample bronchial washing brushing may collect baseline 4 8 week start therapy analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
