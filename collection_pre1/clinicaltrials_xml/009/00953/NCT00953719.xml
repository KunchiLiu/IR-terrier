	<brief_summary>This study supplement 28 mm Ceramic-on-Ceramic study design evaluate artificial hip 28 mm ceramic head liner determine whether perform well artificial hip 28 mm ceramic head polyethylene liner . This arm study design compare 36 mm ceramic head sleeve subset control ( 28mm ceramic head polyethylene sleeve ) original study ( G030075 ) ( NCT # 00208507 ) additional follow-up , determine perform well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>36 mm Ceramic-on-Ceramic Acetabular Cup Total Hip Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total Hip Arthroplasty ( THA ) surgical reconstruction hip joint replacement femoral head acetabular articulating surface fix prosthetic device . The goal THA relief pain , restoration function , correction deformity . THA one common adult reconstructive procedure . Over past 25 year , patient need hip joint replace , either due trauma arthritic disease , typically hip joint bone articular surface replace metal hip stem , metal ball head ( either stainless steel chrome cobalt ) plastic acetabular cup ( metal/metal/plastic ) . While basic device remain essentially unchanged period , technological advancement implant designs material , improvement surgical technique instrumentation make THA one durable successful procedure medicine . Reproducible , high-quality , short-term mid-term result attain regularly , total hip replacement commonly last 10 15 year longer . The success procedure allow expansion wider , often young active population . In spite improvement THA , little change occur acetabular cup liner , usually make Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene plastic ( UHMWPe ) . Because plastic inherently soft somewhat pliable load , cup 's articular surface must inevitability wear produce debris . This biologic response think significant contributor prosthetic component loosening , primary failure mode THR . UHMWPe also degrade time body . As concern polyethylene wear associate untoward effect generate wear debris , THA continue use young higher-demand patient increase life expectancy , interest ceramic ceramic total hip prosthesis renew . An alumina ceramic-on-ceramic acetabular couple employed alternative metal/polyethylene coupling . This ceramic-on-ceramic couple many advantage , include elimination polyethylene device system , wear rate appreciably less experienced metal/polyethylene coupling reduce biologic reactivity . The potential benefit alumina ceramic/ceramic bearing significant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Noninflammatory degenerative joint disease . Composite diagnose NIDJD include osteoarthritis , avascular necrosis , posttraumatic arthritis , slip capital femoral epiphysis ( SCFE ) , fracture pelvis , developmental dysplasia . Xray evaluation confirms presence NIDJD Femoral acetabular bone stock sufficient , regard strength shape , suitable receive implant . Individuals 20 75 year age time surgery Patients previous total hip replacement contralateral leg pain rating none slight least one year post arthroplasty eligible participation study . Harris Hip Score 70 low Pain least Moderate Presence previous prosthetic hip replacement device ( type , include surface replacement arthroplasty , endoprosthesis , etc . ) hip joint operate . Previous Girdlestone procedure ( resection arthroplasty ) surgical fusion hip operate . Acute femoral neck fracture . Above knee amputation contralateral and/or ipsilateral leg . Patients bilateral degenerative joint disease require stag simultaneous hip replacement . Patients exist total hip arthroplasty contralateral hip Harris Hip pain rating mild , moderate , mark totally disabled . Patients undergone total hip arthroplasty contralateral hip within past 12 month . Patients know allergy metal ( e.g . jewelry ) . Skeletally immature patient ( tibial femoral epiphysis close ) . Evidence active infection may spread area body ( e.g. , osteomyelitis , pyogenic infection hip joint , overt infection , urinary tract infection , etc. ) . The presence highly communicable disease disease may limit followup ( e.g. , immunocompromised condition , hepatitis , active tuberculosis , etc. ) . Presence know metastatic neoplastic disease . Significant neurologic musculoskeletal disorder disease may adversely affect gait weight bearing , ( e.g. , muscular dystrophy , multiple sclerosis ) . Conditions may interfere total hip arthroplasty 's survival outcome , ( e.g. , Paget 's disease , Charcot 's disease ) . Any patient believe unwilling unable comply rehabilitation program cementless total hip replacement indicate difficulty inability return followup visit prescribe study protocol . Patient know pregnant , prisoner , mentally incompetent , and/or alcohol drug abuser . Any systemic steroid therapy , exclude inhaler , within three month prior surgery . Patients carry diagnosis inflammatory degenerative arthritis ( IDJD ) include follow composite diagnosis : rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , pigment villonodular synovitis , juvenile rheumatory arthritis arthritic process inflammatory autoimmune etiology . Patients require structural bone graft order support prosthetic component ( ) shape bone receive implant ( ) . Patients refuse provide consent participate clinical investigation . Surgical replacement require use acetabular liner femoral head great small 36mm diameter</criteria>
