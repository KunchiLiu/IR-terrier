	<brief_summary>The poor survival Veterans oral cancer underscore significance identifying new treatment approach . The proposed study test new 2 pronged immunotherapeutic approach oral cancer patient lessen immune inhibitory environment mature cell stimulate T cell reactivity oral cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Plus Celecoxib Therapy Stimulate Intratumoral Immune Reactivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis study beneficial T cell reactivity oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) tumor synergistically stimulate block suppressor endothelial cell induction inhibitory cell population also mature immune inhibitory CD34+ cell antigen-presenting dendritic cell . To test hypothesis , newly diagnose OSCC patient administer cyclooxigenase 2 inhibitor celecoxib and/or Calcitriol 3 week duration cancer diagnosis surgical treatment . The following aims test immunological clinical effectiveness combination treatment : - 1 . To block suppressive activity endothelial cell increase level dendritic stimulatory T cell reactivity , thereby synergistically increase intratumoral T cell reactivity . These functional immune analysis use OSCC tissue remove untreated patient patient treat celecoxib and/or Calcitriol . - 2 . To reduce development OSCC recurrence synergistically stimulate intratumoral T cell reactivity celecoxib block suppressor endothelial cell activity Calcitriol mature CD34+ suppressor cell T cell stimulatory dendritic cell .</detailed_description>
