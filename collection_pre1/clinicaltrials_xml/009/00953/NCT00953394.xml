	<brief_summary>Well differentiate neuroendocrine carcinoma low proliferative activity conventional chemotherapy recommend . Metronomic chemotherapy , i.e . frequent administration cytotoxic drug low dos , demonstrate antiangiogenetic property . Since well differentiate NE carcinomas highly vascular , rationale test metronomic chemotherapy clinical setting . A phase II study design test activity protract 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU ) infusion plus long-acting release ( LAR ) octreotide patient neuroendocrine carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>5FU Octreotide Long-acting Release ( LAR ) Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metastatic locally advance well differentiate neuroendocrine carcinoma treat 5Fluorouracil protract intravenous infusion ( 200 mg/m2 daily ) plus Octreotide LAR ( 20 mg monthly ) . Primary Endpoint : response treatment , evaluate accord RECIST criterion . Secondary Endpoints : - toxicity , grade accord NCI-CTG criterion ; - symptomatic response : evaluate accord change frequency intensity symptom ; - biochemical response : evaluate consider change tumor marker level ( circulate Chromogranin A ) ; - time progression survival : measured date treatment start date progression date last follow-up death , respectively .</detailed_description>
