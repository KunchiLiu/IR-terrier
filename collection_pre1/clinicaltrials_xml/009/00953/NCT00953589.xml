	<detailed_description>The aim 480 STUDY compare efficacy safety 480ug Locteron dose every week 1.5 ug/kg PegIntron dose weekly treatment-naïve genotype-1 chronic HCV subject treat weight-based ribavirin . This 12-week study comprise two panel ( Panel A Panel B ) . The designs panel identical . HCV RNA measure weekly three week every week . Adverse event include flu-like event depression collect weekly clinic visit 12 week . Flu-like event also collect daily 12 week subject self-report use internet ( ePRO ) . Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) Short Form-36 score measure baseline monthly Week 12 . In Panel A 480 STUDY , 42 treatment-naïve subject chronic genotype-1 HCV Bulgaria Romania randomize dose either Locteron q2weeks weekly PegIntron , combination weight-based ribavirin ( 13 ) . In Panel A , 19 subject receive 480ug Locteron 23 subject receive PegIntron . In Panel B 480 STUDY , 32 treatment-naïve subject genotype-1 HCV Israel randomize dose either Locteron q2weeks weekly PegIntron , combination weight-based ribavirin ( 13 ) .
