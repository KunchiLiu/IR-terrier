	<brief_summary>This project design examine impact tailor feedback site performance . The investigator ' objective evaluate whether 'personalized target ' feedback , education performance improvement intervention great impact adherence recommend guideline standard feedback . The investigator hypothesize site-specific report centrally identify target improvement pair target specific intervention enable site quickly identify prioritize salient problem area , ready access analysis factor underlie problem , formulate effective action plan . The investigator also hypothesize hospital randomize receive intervention likely improve overall performance , well target specific performance , period observation direct response activate QI process . Outcomes : The primary outcome improvement overall composite metric eligible intervention regardless selection target . The secondary outcome improvement composite target metric . Outcomes assess participate site , among relevant performance subgroup ( low performer , academic center , full service , among medication versus process metric ) .</brief_summary>
