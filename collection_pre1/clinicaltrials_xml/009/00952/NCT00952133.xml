	<detailed_description>Post-operative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) frequent complication surgery , considerable medical economic impact . It also associate high level patient discomfort dissatisfaction . To many patient , PONV distress event reportedly fear post-operative pain . The cause PONV complex due multiple factor . These factor may include certain characteristic patient ( female gender , non-smoking status , experience PONV past ) , surgical procedure ( intra-abdominal laparoscopic procedure , gynecologic surgery , breast surgery ) , type anesthetic use . Untreated , incidence post-operative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) high risk patient reach 70-80 % . In addition , important note PONV present first 24 hour surgery beyond . PONV alone one leading cause delayed discharge unplanned hospital admission follow outpatient surgery . Furthermore , 35 % surgical outpatient experience PONV follow discharge , many experience nausea vomit recovery room . An important factor development Post-operative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) appear release biogenic amine serotonin ( 5-HT3 ) brainstem peripheral nervous system . Serotonin induce nausea vomit via 5-HT3 receptor . Currently , medication block 5-HT3 receptor widely accept first-line anti-emetic prevention treatment PONV . Ondansetron commonly prescribe . An intra-venous dose Ondansetron administer intra-operatively predict reduce PONV 15-20 % compare patient receive placebo . However , Ondansetron half-life approximately six hour must re-dosed patient prolong delayed-onset PONV . By contrast , Palonosetron another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist longer half-life Ondansetron , thus reduce need re-dosing ; single dose Palonosetron show superior single dose Ondansetron treatment delay nausea vomit associate chemotherapy . Furthermore , evidence multimodal approach prevention post-operative nausea vomit effective single medication . A recent study determine combination regimen Ondansetron Dexamethasone ( steroid medication know prevent nausea vomit ) provide significantly well prophylaxis PONV Ondansetron alone . Therefore , rationale conduct study evaluate whether administration single dose Palonosetron combine Dexamethasone superior single dose Palonosetron alone prevention immediate delay PONV high risk patient undergo laparoscopic abdominal gynecologic surgery . In order answer question whether Palonosetron plus Dexamethasone significantly effective reduce incidence PONV Palonosetron alone , enroll patient high risk PONV undergo laparoscopic abdominal gynecologic surgery . This subset include : female patient , non-smokers , patient history PONV . Each study patient receive Palonosetron alone Palonosetron plus Dexamethasone immediately prior start her/his surgery . We use 11 point nausea scale determine many patient complete response medication ( complete response = NO nausea NO vomiting time study period 0-72 hour post surgery ) . If patient experience nausea vomiting , record time severity PONV well whether medication give relieve nausea vomiting . If patient discharge hospital 72nd hour post surgery , ( ) receive journal record symptoms nausea vomit member research team call obtain information . We predict combination Palonosetron plus Dexamethasone superior Palonosetron alone prevention PONV . We compare incidence patient complete response study medication ( NO nausea NO vomit 72 hour post surgery ) determine hypothesis valid .</detailed_description>
