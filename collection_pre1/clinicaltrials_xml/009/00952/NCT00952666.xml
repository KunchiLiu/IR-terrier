	<brief_summary>Neurovascular bundle ( NVB ) contain capsular vessel prostate cavernous nerve provide macroscopic landmark use nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy . The preservation NVB radical prostatectomy improve postoperative recovery potency continence . However , visualization NVB radical prostatectomy challenge . Recently , attempt make use transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) image delineate anatomy prostate gland NVB laparoscopic radical prostatectomy . However , difficult obtain steady image TRUS operator . The investigator plan perform feasibility study obtain TRUS image prostate NVB robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( RALRP ) . The investigator plan use robot-assisted TRUS probe holder gently manipulate probe obtain steady TRUS image may aid visualization dissection NVB RALRP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transrectal Ultrasound Imaging Prostate Gland Neurovascular Bundles During Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During surgery prostate cancer , precise resection tumor-containing prostate gland preservation neurovascular bundle ( NVB ) critical prevent tumor recurrence potency preservation follow surgery . However , due periprostatic connective tissue bleed , difficult visualize NVB surgery , even surgical loupe laparoscopic magnification . Ultrasound ( US ) commonly use image prostate diagnostic therapeutic procedure diagnostic biopsy . US image addition classic laparoscopic image potentially provide decreased surgical margin improve dissection NVB laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( LRP ) accord study Cleveland Clinic group . In study , assistant manipulate TRUS probe direction surgeon hold place request . At critical point surgery , surgeon visualize NVB Doppler-capable ultrasound monitor . The image , however , difficult interpret surgeon direct control TRUS probe . In addition , challenge surgeon communicate assistant obtain steady useful image . Moreover , study perform exclusively LRP without daVinci® robot ( Intuitive Surgical , Inc. ) , commonly perform surgical approach radical prostatectomy . To overcome obstacle study Ukimura al. , propose use mechanical support arm hold manipulate TRUS probe daVinci® robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( robotic LRP ) .. This application feasibility study involve six patient . We obtain TRUS image prostate NVB robotic LRP procedure . These image acquire first part operation perform minimal interference operation . We record analyze TRUS image investigate feasibility use mechanical support arm TRUS probe . The propose study proof concept follow protocol .</detailed_description>
