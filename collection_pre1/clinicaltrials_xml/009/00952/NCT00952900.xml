	<brief_summary>With great economic cost traditionally poor outcome among chronic temporomandibular joint muscle disorder ( TMJMD ) patient , become important treat patient acute state , order prevent chronic disability problem . This goal two past fund grant project . Results initial project isolate risk factor successfully predict development chronicity 91 % accuracy rate . A statistical algorithm develop used second project screen `` high-risk '' patient . These patient randomly assign early intervention non-intervention group . One-year follow-up evaluation document treatment efficacy cost effectiveness early intervention . These result major implication effective early intervention significant health care cost saving prevalent pain disability problem . For present propose project , plan implement treatment program order evaluate effectiveness community-based dental practice . This response NIH 's request implementation evidence-based treatment approach , develop control clinical setting , `` real world '' diverse practice community . Acute TMJMD patient recruit two community-based clinic . Based upon `` risk '' screen algorithm , high-risk patient randomly assign one two group ( n=225/group ) : early biobehavioral intervention attention-control group . It hypothesize attention control `` high-risk '' patient display chronic TMJMD problem , relative `` high-risk '' early intervention patient , one- two-year follow-up . A number biopsychosocial measure evaluate , include chew performance , RDC/TMD , self-reported pain stress , etc . Such multi-level , multi-systems approach apply good understand biopsychosocial underpinnings TMJMD . Results component project greatly aid stimulating future research lead well understanding TMJMD , well well tailor prescribed treatment regimen .</brief_summary>
