	<brief_summary>Patients endoscopically diagnose active duodenal ulcer disease enrol randomize , double-blind , parallel positive-controlled trial . They randomly assign two group , 10 mg/day ilaprazole 20 mg/day omeprazole , treat four week see week 1 , 2 4 . The primary endpoint ulcer heal rate week 4 . Healing ulcer determine resolution active scarring stage . Symptoms relief evaluate secondary end point use grade score . Safety tolerability evaluate basis clinical assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint heal rate ulcer , base post-treatment ( week 4 ) endoscopic change stage ulcer relative baseline ( week 0 ) level . Stages ulcer endoscopically assess accord degree ulceration , regenerate epithelialization , scar , define follow : A stage ( active stage , A1 &amp; A2 ) A1 stage severe A2 stage , H stage ( heal stage , H1 &amp; H2 ) H2 stage well H1 stage , S stage ( scarring stage , S1 ( red scar ) &amp; S2 ( white scar ) ) S stage best stage three stage S2 stage well S1.Healing ulcer deem successful ulcer A stage resolve S stage end treatment period , regardless S1 S2 . When endoscopy demonstrate successful ulcer healing , study medication discontinue . Patients return week 2 , unhealed endoscopic assessment would do week 4 . Secondary endpoint include post-treatment resolution relate gastrointestinal symptom upper abdominal pain , heartburn , acid regurgitation , nausea &amp; vomiting , eructation , increase flatus . These symptom record scale range 0 3 ( 0=none , 1=mild , 2=moderate , 3=severe ) baseline , week 1 , 2 , 4 . Resolution symptom define `` excellence '' , `` effective '' , `` improve '' , `` ineffective '' relative baseline level , complete symptom relief complete absence symptom without recurrence deem `` excellence '' . Safety assessment base mainly occurrence , frequency , severity adverse event , monitor throughout duration study , also base comprehensive index , include physical examination , electrocardiography , routine laboratory investigation , perform baseline repeat end treatment period . For adverse event , necessary , patient withdraw study .</detailed_description>
