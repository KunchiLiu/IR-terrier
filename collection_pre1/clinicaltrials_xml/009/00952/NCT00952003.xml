	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine efficacy Oxaliplatin / Irinotecan / Bevacizumab therapy follow Docetaxel / Bevacizumab therapy follow Bevacizumab progression treatment locally advance metastatic gastric cancer , term response rate ( complete partial response , determine radiologic evaluation accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) ) . Secondary objective Secondary Objective : To determine safety profile Oxaliplatin/Irinotecan/Bevacizumab therapy follow Docetaxel/Bevacizumab therapy follow Bevacizumab progression term qualitative quantitative toxicity first study treatment dose completion study treatment due progression reason . Secondary Objective : To evaluate study population respect follow : overall survival ( treatment start death cause ) progression free survival ( treatment start progression death cause ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This non-randomized , multicenter , open-label , single-arm Phase II study patient inoperable histologically proven inoperable locally advanced metastatic gastric cancer . Eligible patient must therapy naïve receive previous chemotherapy immune therapy inoperable gastric cancer . Neo/Adjuvant Chemotherapy adjuvant Chemo/Radiotherapy allow . A total 40 evaluable patient recruit evaluated efficacy safety sequential chemoimmunotherapy combination regime . Overall Study Design : Eligible patient receive Oxaliplatin , Irinotecan Bevacizumab 3 cycle follow Docetaxel Bevacizumab 3 cycle . Upon completion combination therapy cycle Bevacizumab continue progression . Safety assessment conduct 4-weekly interval ; efficacy assessment conduct 12 weekly interval , completion every third treatment cycle . This study expect start Q1 2009 . The last patient expect enter study Q2 2010 , follow 18 month recruitment period . Taking account treatment duration study expect end Q4 2010 . Study end Last Subject Last Visit Final Staging upon disease progression . Follow-up Last Subject Last Visit conduct accord local standard care thereafter , part study procedure .</detailed_description>
