	<brief_summary>Background : Vitamin A utmost importance health survival child . A recent series The Lancet maternal child health put vitamin A deficiency top important micronutrient deficiency , responsible 600.000 child deaths/year worldwide . Vitamin A status mother infant closely link . Hence , mother vitamin A deficiency give enough vitamin A fetus build store last month pregnancy , also insufficient amount vitamin A breast milk , result high risk vitamin A deficiency newborn infant . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) implement several strategy fight vitamin A deficiency mother child . One give woman delivery high dose vitamin A supplement , improve vitamin A status mother , via breast milk , infant . Surprisingly however , several recent study investigate effect high dose vitamin A supplement mother directly birth found effect vitamin A status infants 6 month age . In contrast , early study Bangladesh Indonesia , woman receive high dose vitamin A supplement somewhere first 6 week delivery , report large impact vitamin A status infants 6 mo age . The WHO recommendation post-partum vitamin A supplementation base early study Bangladesh Indonesia . The recent study suggest however intervention effective , million woman currently receive high dose vitamin A supplement without clear benefit vitamin A status either woman child . The human body react infection injury inflammatory response , kick acute phase response . The acute phase response help body fight infection . It characterize many altered physiological process , include change availability vitamins mineral . Recently , find delivery cause major acute phase response . We form hypothesis acute phase response initiate delivery prevents high dose vitamin A supplement give mother directly delivery absorb available breast milk . If true , current WHO recommendation give vitamin A within first 6 week post-partum change give vitamin A 4 - 6 week post-partum instead , allow acute phase response induce delivery fade . Objective ( ) Hypothesis ( e ) : The main objective improve effectiveness current WHO policy vitamin A supplementation delivery improve vitamin A status health mother infant . Methodology : In randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial , 400 woman receive high dose vitamin A ( 200.000 IU ) within 6 week delivery , recommend WHO . Half woman receive vitamin A directly delivery ( within 3 day , current practice ) , whereas woman receive vitamin A 6 week delivery . To guarantee blinding , woman receive placebo capsule receive vitamin A capsule . Main outcomes maternal infant vitamin A status 6 month post-partum time-course acute phase response , establish optimal time delivery initiation vitamin A supplementation . Secondary outcome morbidity infant first 6 month life growth performance infant 6 mo age . Potential Impact : The result study enable WHO improve effectiveness current WHO recommendation concern post-partum vitamin A supplementation . If hypothesis true , postpone time post-partum vitamin A supplement directly delivery 6 week post-partum , significantly increase availability supplement mother . This increase vitamin A status mother infant . Moreover , several significant implication global health policy , important consequence infant survival worldwide reduce morbidity mortality infectious disease first 6 month life . Results study also important consequence micronutrient health program , vitamin A supplementation child 6 month age iron supplementation area endemic malaria , also subject effect acute phase response</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Making Maternal Post-partum Vitamin A Supplementation Effective : The Role Timing Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background . Undernutrition cause 3.5 million child death year , vitamin A deficiency alone responsible almost 0.6 million child death per year1 . Vitamin A supplementation child 6 month age show reduce overall mortality 23 % . The effect vitamin A supplementation newborns morbidity mortality less clear , three study India , Indonesia Nepal show reduction neonatal mortality 22 % , 64 % 15 % respectively , 2 trial Africa report effect . In view expect health benefit improve vitamin A status infant , WHO currently recommend woman receive high dose ( 200.000 IU ) vitamin A within first 6 week postpartum , order improve maternal vitamin A status , vitamin A content breast milk , thereby vitamin A status infant . However , several recent trial woman receive 200.000 IU vitamin A directly post-partum , report improvement vitamin A status either mother infant 6 mo age , even double dose 400.000 IU . In study vitamin A give within week delivery , current typical practice even though WHO actually state window 6 week delivery . In contrast , 2 early study Bangladesh Indonesia report large impact post-partum maternal supplementation vitamin A status infants 6 mo age . In study , woman receive high dose vitamin A supplement directly post-partum , somewhere first 6 week delivery . The WHO recommendation maternal post-partum vitamin A supplementation base effect observe early study , recent study suggest intervention effective , million woman receive high dose vitamin A supplement without clear benefit vitamin A status either woman child . The difference time early study recent study give vitamin A may hold key , believe identify biological reason time supplementation could utmost importance : inflammatory response delivery . Delivery induce considerable physiological inflammatory response , distinct acute phase response , magnitude see instance pulmonary tuberculosis patient . We believe lack effect current practice give high dose vitamin A supplement directly post-partum due acute phase response induce delivery , intervention would successful supplementation give acute phase response fade away 3 - 6 week . There currently data available vitamin A bioavailability lactate woman , study Zambian pre-school child investigate effectiveness high dose vitamin A supplementation campaign child , show successful child without inflammation . Children sign inflammation increase vitamin A status . Inflammation accompany acute phase response also know affect availability micronutrient besides vitamin A , iron zinc . Objective ( ) Hypothesis ( e ) : Hypothesis The acute phase response ( APR ) induce delivery reduces vitamin A bioavailability , interfere current maternal post-partum high dose vitamin A supplementation program worldwide . Objective 1 To determine effect acute phase response vitamin A bioavailability . Objective 2 To determine time course acute phase response delivery . Overall goal To improve effectiveness current WHO recommendation post-partum maternal high dose vitamin A supplementation determine optimal timing supplementation relation post-partum APR . Design Methods : A randomised , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial 400 woman , compare effect recommend dose 200.000 IU vitamin A give within first week post-partum ( current practice , 200 woman ) effect give 6 week post-partum , still within WHO recommend intervention window ( 200 woman ) . Main outcomes maternal infant vitamin A status 6 month post-partum , breast milk vitamin A concentration time-course acute phase response , establish optimal time delivery vitamin A supplementation . Secondary outcome morbidity infant first 6 month life anthropometrical index infant 6 mo age . Potential Impact : If hypothesis true , current global health strategy postpartum vitamin A supplementation improve vitamin A status mother infant make effective change timing . This significant implication global health policy , important consequence infant survival worldwide improve vitamin A status reduce morbidity mortality infectious disease first 6 month life . Moreover , result study important consequence micronutrient health program , vitamin A supplementation child 6 month age iron zinc supplementation program , also affect acute phase response . Overall , result research contribute improve child survival worldwide .</detailed_description>
