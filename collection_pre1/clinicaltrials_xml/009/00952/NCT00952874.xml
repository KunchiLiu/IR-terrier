	<detailed_description>Background : In highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) era , incidence many cancer remain high HIV-positive general population . This true AIDS-defining malignancy , Kaposi 's sarcoma lymphoma , also cancer , comprise 58 % neoplasm recently describe US cohort [ 1 ] . This trend generate renew interest understand molecular mechanism carcinogenesis immune suppress patient . Potential explanation include prolonged survival patient HIV HAART , high incidence co-infection oncogenic virus , exposure risk smoke alcohol [ 2 ] . Squamous cell carcinoma anus ( SCCA ) require integration human papillomavirus ( HPV ) DNA anal canal cell chromosome . HIV-positive men increase risk develop anal cancer . A Swiss study link Swiss HIV cohort study Swiss cantonal cancer registry show greatly elevate SIRs anal cancer ( SIR = 33.4 , 95 % CI = 10.5-78.6 ) [ 3 ] . Clearly , HPV-HIV coinfection play major role SCCA development , whether contribution associate distinct molecular pathway carcinogenesis , remain hypothetical [ 4 ] . Anal cancer occur early HIV-positive individual ( mean age 37 year ) compare HIV-negative men ( 58 year ) HIV-negative woman ( 65 year ) . This difference two decade age onset support hypothesis biology SCCA differ HIV-positive HIV-negative patient [ 5 ] . The effect HIV infection natural history anal HPV infection poorly understood , expert agree two point : 1 ) 95 % HIV-positive homosexual men co-infected HPV ; 2 ) HIV infection favor persistence HPV infection within ano-genital tract ( uterine cervix , vagina , anal canal ) . Two major mutually exclusive type genomic instability involve cancer progression . The first , know chromosomal instability ( CIN ) , result series genetic change , include activation oncogene inactivation tumor-suppressor gene p53 APC . The second , know microsatellite instability ( MSI ) , result somatic ( acquire ) inactivation DNA mismatch repair gene ( MMR ) , MLH1 ( hypermethylation promoter ) , typically lead mutation gene cod microsatellites , BAT 25 , BAT26 CAT25 , transform growth factor receptor II ( TGF-RII ) BAX [ 6 ] . MSI reflect genomewide instability ( result deficient MMR system ) , occur increased frequency HIV-associated cervical intraepithelial lung neoplasia . In case , frequency MSI six fold great HIV-associated tumor , compare tumor HIV-indeterminate patient [ 7 ] . Others author also report high rate MSI Kaposi 's sarcoma aggressive lymphoma obtain HIV-infected patient , whereas evidence similar instability lesion HIV-negative patient [ 8 ] . The recent observation MSI phenotype restrict HIV-related lymphoma suggest cardinal feature cancer , genetic instability , highly influenced host immunity [ 9 ] . MSI status SCCA HIV-positive patient never investigate , perform CIN analysis tumor specimens 18 HIV- 10 HIV+ patient diagnose SCCA two US institution [ 10 ] . Tumors HIV-negative patient likely present CIN tumor HIV-positive patient ( 24.1 % versus 6.6 % , P &lt; 0.001 ) . Consistent loss heterozygosity ( LOH ) chromosomes 17p , 18q , 5q , 11q observe HIV-negative patient SCCA . By contrast , allelic loss 17p , 5q , 18q virtually absent tumor HIV-positive individual , indicate immune suppression promote SCCA progression alternate pathway CIN . Own Research Field : The applicant colorectal surgeon , directly involve treatment patient anorectal malignancy since 2001 . He collect preliminary data show specific pattern molecular aberration HIV-related SCCA . These finding publish peer-reviewed journal , consequence applicant regularly solicit Editors write expert opinion state art review field . The Swiss cohort HIV-positive patient provide unique opportunity conduct research , large number individual already enrol exist database , exist expertise field develop Professor Hirschel team . A large population patient indeed sine qua none condition start project due relative rarity tumor . Last least , molecular aspect research conduct laboratory Dr Pierre Hutter , PhD , leader country detection hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC ) . Thus , Dr Hutter laboratory provide excellent environment perform molecular analysis describe herein . Study Hypotheses : We hypothesize , HIV population , microsatellite instability , rather chromosomal instability , favour pathway rapid progression anal intra-epithelial neoplasia towards invasive SCCA . The second hypothesis , comparison , MSI either absent least rare SCCA HIV-negative individual . Study Aims Objectives The primary objective study ass microsatellite instability status tumor specimens 15 HIV-positive patient Swiss Cohort diagnose SCCA ; interim analysis perform determine incidence MSI SCCA HIV-positive patient . If majority tumours exhibit MSI population , proceed second part study , objective perform analyse similar tumor 15 HIV-negative patient , thus compare molecular profile SCCA population . By , potential role immune suppression carcinogenesis progression might establish . Study Design Plan Patients : Patients Swiss HIV cohort biopsy-proven diagnosis squamous cell carcinoma anus identify use exist database . We choose analyse least 15 sample , depend availability , 3 SHCS center . Tumors HIV-negative patient underwent surgery SCCA retrieve Department Pathology University Hospital Geneva , pending review protocol local Ethics Committee . Intervention : All tumor sample reassess confirmation diagnosis pathologist . For patient , paraffin block tumor tissue normal mucosa select DNA extraction polymerase chain reaction microsatellite target . The tissue routinely collect operating room , fix buffer formalin , embed paraffin , store variable number month prior selection analysis . Paraffin-embedded block cut microtome 20-µm thick section . Using sterile scalpel blade , area normal ( non-tumor ) cancer tissue microdissected dissect microscope utilize haematoxylin eosin-stained section guide . The specimen deparaffinised toluol , purify absolute ethanol , centrifuge 14,000 rpm . Previous experience Dr Hutter 's laboratory demonstrate indeed technically possible perform type molecular analysis paraffin-embedded tumour specimen . We use reference panel microsatellite primer recommend colorectal cancer specimens determine presence microsatellite instability SCCA . These include microsatellite marker BAT25 , BAT26 , well CAT25 . Study Evaluations : Initial evaluation data perform analysis first 15 tumour specimen . If MSI detect HIV-positive population , investigation conduct tumor HIV-negative patient . Data analysis subject progress report conduct investigator regular interval . We choose restrict , least initially , analysis 15 tumour three reason : 1 . This relatively rare cancer , unlikely able retrieve 25 SCCA patient Swiss HIV cohort . 2 . Our previous study conduct 18 tumour specimen group , differences group statistically significant . 3 . This pilot exploratory study , work hypothesis may prove wrong ; therefore critical limit initial cost accordance study budget availability Dr Hutter 's expertise . If hypothesis support initial result , may proceed additional investigation elaborate research project adequate funding resources.¨ For reason , restrict research three SHCS center . Zurich , Geneva Lausanne choose essentially base exist relationship visceral surgery unit . Data Analysis : MSI status tumor assess Pierre Hutter . The result correlate epidemiological data Swiss cohort , correlate patient ` clinical characteristic , include viral load , CD4+ count , well clinical outcome . The result also correlate treatment outcome cancer survival . Time Frame : Tumor specimen retrieve Departments Pathology Lausanne , Geneva Zurich begin 2009 . The MSI analysis straightforward procedure , take 24 hour laboratory Dr Hutter . Thus , analysis 15 specimen HIV-positive population complete end March 2009 . Further decision regard subsequent analysis HIV-negative population subject decision , accord result obtain initial tumor . Status Ethical Approval : Patients enrol Swiss HIV cohort study initially give consent participate type study . Almost patient HIV centre consent take part genetic research order identify specific factor might result difference course disease . Obviously , analysis perform tumor specimen , traceable patient ' identity . Thus , genetic test totally anonymous . By contrast , approval local Ethics Committee Geneva seek , analysis perform tumor specimen HIV-negative patient . Study budget : The initial analysis 15 HIV-positive patient perform free charge Pierre Hutter . The cost molecular study estimate 250.-CHF per case . Thus , case analysis MSI group lead promise result , estimate cost analysis 12-15 HIV-negative patient cost around 3,000.-CHF . Funding type research available Fonds de Service Department Surgery University Hospital Geneva .</detailed_description>
