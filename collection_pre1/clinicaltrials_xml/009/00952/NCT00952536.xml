	<brief_summary>There 3 hypothesis test : 1 . That daily supplementation Juice Plus+ significantly improve treatment outcome placebo supplementation , 3-months post-therapy , use adjunct conventional non-surgical periodontal therapy . 2 . Triple therapy Juice Plus+ ( fruit , vegetable &amp; berry ) produce additional treatment benefit dual therapy ( fruit &amp; vegetable ) placebo . 3 . Improved treatment outcome Juice Plus+ maintain 9-months post-therapy . Brief Summary : Periodontal disease highly prevalent chronic inflammatory disease major cause tooth loss . Data support association periodontitis prevalence reduce serum level antioxidant . Anecdotal report periodontal specialist indicate significant improvement clinical outcome periodontal therapy adjunctive Juice Plus+ use , agreement research data systemic disease hyper-inflammation implicated disease pathogenesis . There however , lack scientific evidence clinical trial periodontitis . Given demonstrable antioxidant deficiency periodontitis patient ( locally peripherally ) , excess oxidative stress periodontitis patient , anecdotal evidence clinical benefit adjunctive use Juice Plus+ , study proposes investigate impact daily supplementation Juice Plus+ adjunct traditional non-surgical periodontal therapy , improve therapeutic outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Dietary Intake Dried Whole Food Concentrates ( Juice Plus ) Clinical Outcomes Following Periodontal Therapy : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This longitudinal , randomise , stratify ( age ) , double-blind , 3-arm study non-surgical periodontal therapy . The 3 arm : 1 . Daily Juice Plus+ 2 vegetable &amp; 2 fruit &amp; 2 berry capsule ( test group 1 ) 2 . Daily Juice Plus+ 2 vegetable &amp; 2 fruit &amp; 2 placebo capsule ( test group 2 ) 3 . Daily Placebo form 6 capsule ( control group ) Volunteers receive standard non-surgical periodontal therapy single operator ( study hygienist ) outcome measure assess baseline , 3 , 6 9-months post-therapy . Capsules take food twice daily ( 3 capsule &amp; 3 capsule pm ) . 60 non-smoking patient chronic moderate/severe periodontitis recruit outpatient periodontal clinic Birmingham 's Dental Hospital . Subjects 30-60 year age , male female . Chronic periodontitis ( CP ) define presence 2 site per quadrant pocket interproximal attachment loss &gt; 6mm 1/3rd radiographic bone loss . The following exclusion criterion apply : - Patients aggressive disease - Patients physical mental disability - Pregnant woman - Patients whose medical history may place risk complication periodontal therapy ( e.g . need antibiotic cover , warfarinised subject ) - Patients take long term anti-microbial anti-inflammatory drug - Patients unable swallow Juice Plus+ capsule - Patients unable provide inform consent - Current smoker - Patients take regular vitamin supplementation Outcome measure Primary outcome measure heal increase attachment level reduction probe pocket depths 3-months . In addition reduction percentage sit bleed probe ( BOP - measure dichotomously 4 site per tooth ) marginal tissue gingival redness assess visually ( Modified Gingival Index-MGI ) use primary outcome measure tissue inflammation . Secondary outcome measure reduction % site disclose plaque ( PS - measure dichotomously 4 site per tooth ) , reduction gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) volume , increase GCF plasma TAOC . Probing measure perform duplicate constant force ( UNC PC15 ) probe difference duplicate measure great 1mm arise , 3rd measure take . The mean two close measure record . Mean probe attachment pocket depth measure per subject calculate examination point ( baseline , 3 , 6 &amp; 9-months post-therapy ) . The bleeding plaque score express mean per subject examination point MGI score % sit code 0 , 1 , 2 3 per subject . Samples GCF sample collect ( 30 ) use Periopaper strip mesio-buccal aspect 3 deep ( &gt; 6mm ) 3 shallow ( &lt; 3mm ) molar site per subject describe appendix 1 . Volumes read pre-calibrated Periotron 8000 accord standard methodology 19 . Each trio sample strip collect 400ul PBS/BSA buffer snap frozen liquid nitrogen assay 13 . Blood sample ( 2 x 7 ml ) collect Vacutainer™ tube plasma . Platelet deplete plasma prepared centrifugation 1000g 30 min ( 4C ) . Plasma aliquoted cryogenic vial half snap frozen liquid nitrogen TOAC assay . The remain half aliquoted two 1.5ml cryogenic vial store -80C future use ( e.g . assay carotenoid activity ) . All sample store dark keep free direct sunlight stage handle . Enhanced chemiluminescent assay ( ECL ) total antioxidant capacity ( TAOC ) The ECL assay total AO capacity ( TAOC ) develop group 12 base upon horse radish peroxidase catalyse oxidation luminol hydrogen peroxide . A BioOrbit 1250 luminometer ( Labtech International , Sussex , UK ) , interfaced PC run software allow simultaneous record / display 5000 data point period 1 hour use quantify light output . The enhancer , p-iodophenol , longer commercially available synthesise `` house '' . Antioxidant capacities test sample derive standard curve produce use water-soluble vitamin E analogue , 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8 , tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid ( Trolox ; assay range : 0.0625-1.6 nanomole ) run test sample result express concentration ( µM Trolox equivalents/L ; Teq/L ) . All sample subject throughout study ( n=12 : 8 GCF 's - comprise 1 pooled deep site &amp; 1 pool shallow site @ 4 visit &amp; 4 plasma sample ) assay day laboratory condition , duplicate ( total = 24 per subject ) . Each day sample test group 1 subject , test group 2 subject control subject run . All assay complete 10-12 hour laboratory time per day 20 laboratory day ( 72 assay per day &amp; 36 standard = 108 assay per day ) . GCF sample defrost , elute run buffer 30 minute prior assay , 100ul aliquot assayed duplicate . Plasma sample dilute 1:10 PBS/BSA run buffer assay 20ul aliquot duplicate . Calibrations run begin , mid-point end day . Statistical Analysis This perform independent statistician appoint National Safety Associates Inc. All three study hypothesis presume two subject initial attachment level pocket depth would expect final attachment level pocket depth , except effect respective treatment . Therefore , first two hypothesis investigate use Analysis Covariance , 3 month value attachment level pocket depth response , initial value covariate , treatment study factor . Hypothesis 3 investigated similar fashion , except response 9-month measurement . In order test hypotheses 1 3 , Placebo group compare two active treatment group combine . In order test hypothesis 2 , two active treatment group compare . Graphical display regression model use investigate whether response active treatment relate subject 's fruit vegetable intake measure Visual Analogue Scale data . Secondary outcome analyze similar fashion . Both Intention-To-Treat ( ITT ) analyse Per Protocol ( PP ) analyse perform . In ITT analysis , data subject use , regardless adherence treatment . In PP analysis , statistical model include measure adherence . All statistical test two-sided performed 0.05 level significance . The analysis perform use SAS Windows , version 8.2 ( SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC , USA ) , SYSTAT , version 10.2.01 ( SYSTAT Software Inc. , Point Richmond , CA , USA ) . Missing data : The primary outcome measure take part standard care subject ' 9-month review . There reason miss data relate treatment outcome . We check whether miss data relate treatment assignment , otherwise expect able ignore miss value analyse `` miss completely random '' . Code Breaking The code keep seal locked office PI break statistical analysis complete . Power Calculation As pilot study possible perform power calculation base upon antioxidant outcome . However , use primary outcome measure reduction probe pocket depth assume obtain additional PPD reduction 0.5 mm ( 0.4mm ) non-surgical therapy alone supplementation Juice Plus+ capsule , 80 % chance find significant difference p &lt; 0.05 level would need exit 12 ( 17 ) patient per treatment . This base accepted mean PPD reduction mild moderate periodontal disease 1-2mm non-surgical therapy data study perform demonstrated mean PPD reduction 1.08 + 0.4mm ( SD ) . Recruiting 20 per treatment allow drop rate 20 % would still provide sufficient power . Patient Adherence Adherence take supplementation check visit active therapy 3 , 6 , 9-month visit . Subjects provide data sheet log day miss take supplement . In addition , one cryogenic vial contain minimum 500ul plasma archive baseline , 3 , 6 9-months post-therapy subject may use carotenoid assay biochemical verification adherence . GCP Statement This study conduct accordance International Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) standard . Documentation Record-keeping The investigator retain archive document source ( raw ) data pertain study minimum period 10 year . Clinical Study Report The interpretation data joint responsibility Investigator study team . A final report make write responsibility group include : - - appropriate statistical procedure , - deviation protocol ; - conclusion efficacy treatment significance difference .</detailed_description>
