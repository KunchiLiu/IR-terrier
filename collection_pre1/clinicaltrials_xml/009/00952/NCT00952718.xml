	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether inspiratory muscle training could improve and/or prevent deterioration inspiratory muscle strength , clinical cardiopulmonary outcome , systemic immunologic response quality life patient bronchiectasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Inspiratory Muscle Training Patients With Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inspiratory muscle train reportedly beneficial patient diverse chronic cardio-pulmonary disease . It increase inspiratory muscle strength endurance , improve exercise capacity quality life ( QOL ) , decrease perception dyspnea ( POD ) adult stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Though pathophysiology COPD bronchiectasis different , similarity clinical presentation . In COPD patient , lung hyperinflation induces functional weakness inspiratory muscle increase elastic load breathe intrinsic positive end expiratory pressure . Patients bronchiectasis show reduce ratio FEV1/FVC , reduce FEV1 , normal slightly reduce FVC , indicate airway block mucus . However , study use IMT train modality determine effect bronchiectasis . The clinical relevance increase respiratory muscle strength per se IMT alone unknown . This study try evaluate feasibility effectiveness home-based threshold training examine effect IMT extend clinical outcome activity daily live QOL bronchiectasis patient .</detailed_description>
