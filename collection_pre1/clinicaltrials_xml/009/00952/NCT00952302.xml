	<detailed_description>Pulmonary hypertensive disorder frequently complicate hypoxic lung disease worsen patient survival . Hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension also major cause morbidity high altitude . Hypoxia cause pulmonary hypertension hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction vascular remodelling . These process think regulate least part hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) family transcription factor , coordinate intracellular response hypoxia throughout body . HIF regulate cellular degradation process require iron obligate cofactor . In cultured cell HIF degradation inhibit reduction iron ( chelation desferrioxamine ) potentiate iron supplementation . In human , recently show , laboratory experiment last 8 hour , acute iron supplementation blunts pulmonary vascular response hypoxia , acute iron chelation desferrioxamine enhance response . This suggest iron may also affect pulmonary artery pressure response hypoxia long time period . The purpose study investigate link iron pulmonary artery pressure response hypoxia , study conduct high altitude allow concurrent exposure large number participant environmental hypoxia . We wish explore extent time-course effect iron pulmonary artery pressure . Cerro de Pascu ( 4,340 ) Peru provide unique ability make rapid transition sea level high altitude ( 6-8 hour road ) , together requisite research facility . Also , one part study involve recruitment patient chronic mountain sickness , many live Cerro de Pasco .</detailed_description>
