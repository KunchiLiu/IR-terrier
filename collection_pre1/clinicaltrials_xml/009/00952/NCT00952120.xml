	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare well two method ( VAC G-SUC ) secure skin graft use negative pressure wound therapy work . Negative pressure wound therapy commonly use method apply suction wound remove fluid wound promote healing . The VAC system widely use consist foam dress portable computerized suction pump . The G-SUC method use commonly available dress supply attach vacuum ( suction ) pump locate wall hospital bed . The investigator frequently use method past 10 year observe specific negative side effect either .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Methods Securing Skin Grafts Using Negative Pressure Wound Therapy : Vacuum Assisted Closure ( VAC ) Gauze Suction ( GSUC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : A prospective , randomize study conduct . The investigator expect duration data collection 2 year . 1 . PATIENT SELECTION Adult patient sex , hospitalize University Chicago Medical Center , require split thickness skin autograft wound amenable placement occlusive dress negative pressure therapy eligible participate study . If patient primary treating surgeon agree participate , receive inform consent . Pregnant woman , child 18 year age patient `` vulnerable '' define Institutional Review Board eligible study . 2 . STUDY PROCEDURE Preoperative Procedures : Patients wound require skin graft enter trial upon consent patient preoperative decision surgeon secure skin graft negative pressure therapy . Upon entry , primary physical therapist immediately inform study participant place either G-SUC VAC dress conclusion operation . The randomization scheme prepare study statistician use computer generate random number . The surgeon blind treatment modality primary physical therapist place randomize therapy . Intraoperative Procedures : Wounds undergo debridement use standard technique healthy , viable wound bed . Split thickness skin graft harvest patient obtain 0.008-0.010 inch use electric dermatome . In addition standard method achieve hemostasis , Tisseel ( Baxter , Deerfield , IL ) use adjunct preparation wound bed . All graft secure N-Terface Interpositional Material ( Winfield Laboratories , Richardson , TX ) single layer Acticoat ( Smith Nephew , Quebec , Canada ) . Patients skin graft undergo VAC therapy manage continuous negative pressure deliver computerized VAC suction unit 75-125 mm Hg . The suction apply standard open cell VAC foam dress supply KCI , Inc seal occlusive cover . Patients skin graft undergo G-SUC therapy manage negative pressure deliver low continuous wall suction 75-80 mm Hg . The suction apply standard gauze dress seal occlusive cover . Postoperative Procedures : Patients either therapy remain continuous negative pressure therapy conclusion surgery dress takedown . Patients undergo VAC therapy transport computerized VAC suction unit . Maintenance negative pressure transport patient undergo G-SUC therapy accomplish clamp connection tube hemostat prior disconnection wall suction unit . All dressing discontinue post operative day # 4 5 graft take assess two method follow manner : 1 . Areas non-take clearly mark pen researcher blind treatment modality 2 . Images graft ruler scale take digital camera 3 . The entire graft area determine pixel 4 . The area non-take determined pixel 5 . The percentage non-take calculate 6 . The area also measure record Image analysis conduct researcher blind treatment modality . Wound size also calculate per Xakellis &amp; Frantz method ( 1997 ) : wound surface area = length x width x 0.783 . If G-SUC VAC dress maintain either persistent fluid suction leak , attend physical therapist attempt reinforce dressing . If 2 attempt per 24-hour period , dress still maintain , patient consider fail negative pressure wound therapy . Patients fall category able crossover treatment arm , additional data regarding treatment consider result study . The cost VAC rental , supply time perform dress change record duration negative pressure wound therapy patient . The attend physical therapist collect maintain database . Wound Specific Procedures : Upper Extremity . All skin graft mobile structure , cross joint directly muscle , splint prevent shear . Otherwise , patient allow move ad lib . Lower Extremity . All skin graft mobile structure , cross joint directly muscle , splint prevent shear . Patients remain bedrest leg elevation prevent low extremity edema negative pressure therapy discontinue . Chest , Abdomen , Back , Head , Neck . Mobility allow ad lib . Perineum . Patients remain bedrest discontinuation negative pressure therapy prevent shear . 3 . STUDY RECORDS Completed case report form confidential keep secure file principal investigator . 4 . RISKS &amp; BENEFITS TO PATIENTS The investigator aware specific risk associate negative pressure wound therapy , technique associate specific adverse outcome hospital publish literature . Negative pressure wound therapy allow rapid reliable wound heal many patient . Data study may help u expand indication negative pressure wound therapy . There payment subject .</detailed_description>
