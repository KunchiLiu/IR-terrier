	<brief_summary>The main purpose study test ergonomics investigational imaging system take picture blood vessel skin . In plastic reconstructive surgery , blood flow tissue determine whether tissue transplant one location another . This new imaging device use invisible near-infrared fluorescent light see blood vessel otherwise could see eye . This study test system 's basic operation ergonomics operate room .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To perform pilot study FLAREâ„¢ NIR fluorescence image system conjunction indocyanine green ( ICG ) breast reconstructive surgery utilize deep inferior epigastric perforator ( DIEP ) flap . Due patient-to-patient anatomic variation , vascular perfusion cutaneous element flap unpredictable great concern surgeon planning design flap . We propose method image flap base use invisible near-infrared fluorescent light significant advantage patient surgeon . Specific Aims : A pilot optimization study image system combination ICG determine optimal dose , light excitation fluence rate , camera exposure time .</detailed_description>
