	<brief_summary>This protocol describe study gain experience use Clevidipine perioperative blood pressure control patient undergo craniotomy brain tumor epilepsy focus resection . The purpose study establish efficacy Clevidipine intraoperative blood pressure control patient undergo intracranial procedure , gather information dosage adverse effect Clevidipine neurosurgical patient . This initial pilot experience serve familiarize investigator use drug prior initiate plan randomized trial versus institutional standard-of-care therapy . The investigator obtain great familiarity dose clevidipine patient population collect information incidence adverse effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Clevidipine Neurosurgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clevidipine , recently introduce , short-acting , vascular-selective calcium antagonist , could potentially useful adjuvant neurosurgical case . It decrease arterial blood pressure reduce systemic vascular resistance effect venous capacitance vessel ( 7 ) . Clevidipine successfully use treatment hypertension cardiac surgical patient ( 8 ) . However , information available efficacy safety patient undergo intracranial surgery . The perioperative course patient undergoing intracranial surgery frequently complicate acute hypertensive episode . Acute hypertension neurosurgical patient associate intracranial bleeds prolong hospital stay ( 1 ) . Even current neuroanesthesia management , hemodynamic stability may challenge , especially hypertensive patient . An anesthetic technique improve perioperative hemodynamics without increase incidence undesirable event ( increase intracranial pressure , prolonged recovery , etc . ) desirable . A number antihypertensive agent available treat perioperative hypertension . Labetalol commonly use treat hypertensive episode patient undergo craniotomy , may desirable certain patient population low potency , slow onset peak effect ( 2 ) , unpredictability dose requirement ( 3 ) . Esmolol mildly effective treat postoperative hypertension . Perioperative use complicate bradycardia conduction delay . Nicardipine effective esmolol control postoperative hypertension ( 4 ) . However , cause dose-dependent cerebral vasodilation , inhibition autoregulation , well high incidence hypotension ( compare labetalol ) ( 5 ) . Hydralazine may increase intracranial pressure much 100 % rarely used sole agent treat hypertension neurosurgical patient ( 6 ) .</detailed_description>
