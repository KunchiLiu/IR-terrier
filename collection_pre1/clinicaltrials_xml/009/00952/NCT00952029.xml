	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan hydrochloride , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Bevacizumab may stop growth colorectal cancer block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether give one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) effective give without bevacizumab treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give combination chemotherapy without bevacizumab see well work treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Bevacizumab With Without Bevacizumab Maintenance Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare disease-control duration patient metastatic colorectal cancer receive FOLFIRI chemotherapy combination bevacizumab without bevacizumab maintenance therapy . Secondary - Determine objective response rate . - Determine non-hematologic grade 3-4 ( except alopecia ) toxicity rate . - Determine overall toxicity rate . - Determine duration chemotherapy-free interval . - Determine progression-free survival . - Determine overall survival . - Determine time-to-treatment failure . - Determine quality life ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ) . - Complete geriatric evaluation . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord cancer center , primary tumor ( resect vs unresected ) , Köhne criterion ( low v intermediate v high ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm A : Patients receive FOLFIRI chemotherapy comprise irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV 46 hour day 1-2 . Chemotherapy treatment repeat every 2 week 12 course . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute every 2 week chemotherapy . Patients receive bevacizumab maintenance therapy every 2 week chemotherapy-free interval . - Arm B : Patients receive FOLFIRI chemotherapy bevacizumab arm A . Patients receive treatment chemotherapy-free interval . In arm , chemotherapy treatment chemotherapy-free interval treatment repeat absence disease progression chemotherapy portion unacceptable toxicity . Patients progress chemotherapy-free interval receive 12 course chemotherapy . All patient complete quality life questionnaire ( QLQ-30 ) patient ≥ 75 also complete geriatric questionnaire baseline every 8 week study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 8 week .</detailed_description>
