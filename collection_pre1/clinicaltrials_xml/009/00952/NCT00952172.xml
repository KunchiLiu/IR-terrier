	<brief_summary>This 3-year prospective , randomized , control , longitudinal study aim ( 1 ) examine effect stair step exercise training cardiopulmonary fitness sleep situation patient Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome ( OSAS ) , ( 2 ) follow longitudinal change stair step exercise training patient OSAS . Patients meet follow criterion invite participate study : diagnose AHI ( Apnea-hypopnea index ) ＞15/hr ODI ( oxygen desaturation index ) ＞10/hr Polysomnography , age 19 old . Based power analysis , 70 patient OSAS treat outpatient department Chang Gung Medical Center recruit period 26 month . Each patient participate study seventeen week . Patients randomly assign receive stair step exercise addition nurse education standard care , nurse education standard care alone . Stair step exercise perform home daily eight week . Outcomes determine change score cardiopulmonary fitness index , VO2max , six-minute walking distance , daytime sleepiness measure Epworth Sleepiness Scale , sleep time measure Actigraphy , AHI measure Polysomnography ; take four time : treatment ( baseline ) , five week , nine week , seventeen week study . Data analyze use descriptive statistic Generalized Estimating Equation ( GEE ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study seek verify improvement stair step exercise training cardiopulmonary fitness condition sleep condition patient obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) . The quasi-experimental , two group repeated-measures study design use . Patients meet follow criterion invite participate study : diagnose AHI ( Apnea-hypopnea index ) &gt; 15/hr ODI ( oxygen desaturation index ) &gt; 10/hr Polysomnography , age 19 old . Eighteen patient OSAS treat outpatient department Chest Medicine recruit , include study group control group .The study group patient perform stair step exercise training daily eight week home . Outcome measure include cardiorespiratory fitness condition assess 3-Minute YMCA Step Test , include physical fitness index gross oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) , sleep condition assess Epworth Sleepiness Scale , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , Polysomnography . Data record prior stair step exercise Day 1 baseline , end fourth week , end eighth week . Results study show , physical fitness index , Epworth Sleepiness Scale , AHI , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index symptom scale-snoring significantly improve . Differences effect stair step exercise outcome variable either minimal statistically significant . Eight week stair step exercise training could useful increase cardiorespiratory fitness condition improve sleep condition patient OSAS .</detailed_description>
