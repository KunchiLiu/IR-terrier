	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Asfotase Alfa Juvenile Patients With Hypophosphatasia ( HPP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asfotase Alfa formerly refer ENB-0040 Hypophosphatasia ( HPP ) life-threatening , genetic , ultra-rare metabolic disease characterize defective bone mineralization impair phosphate calcium regulation lead progressive damage multiple vital organ , include destruction deformity bone , profound muscle weakness , seizure , impair renal function , respiratory failure . There approve disease-modifying treatment patient disease . There also limit data available natural course disease time , particularly patient juvenile-onset form . Efficacy analyse prospectively define protocol comparison historical control . The historical control group come patient whose characteristic match closely possible entry criterion trial . The control group include patient x-ray within age range define inclusion criterion study ( 5 12 year age , inclusive , open growth plate ) . The pre-specified plan analysis combine two asfotase alfa treat group ( asfotase alfa 2 mg/kg subcutaneous ( SC ) injection three time per week 3 mg/kg subcutaneous ( SC ) injection three time per week ) compare historical control .</detailed_description>
