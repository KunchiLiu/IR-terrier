	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Three Different Devices Kidney Stone Removal During Percutaneous Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Large kidney stone remove surgical procedure small puncture make back kidney ( percutaneous nephrolithotomy PNL ) stone usually need broken small piece remove small surgical incision . There number FDA approve device commercially available used break stone include pneumatic , ultrasonic , combination two . Each technology advantage disadvantage . In last year new , improved version device introduce . These improved version address previous issue probe clog break cumbersome handpiece design . These include Cyberwand ( Cybersonics , Erie , PA ) , dual probe ultrasonic device , Swiss Lithoclast Select ( EMS , Switzerland ) combine pneumatic ultrasonic modality , novel device LMA ( Gland , Switzerland ) call StoneBreakerTM , portable pneumatic device power CO2 cartridge . We propose compare device randomize study see one good another remove kidney stone quickly efficiently .</detailed_description>
