	<brief_title>4-Hydroxytamoxifen Tamoxifen Citrate Treating Women With Newly Diagnosed Ductal Breast Carcinoma Situ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled presurgical trial 0.228 % 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen ( 4-OHT ) gel vs. oral tamoxifen ( TAM ) 20 mg daily . The study population consist 112 pre- postmenopausal woman grade DCIS , ER positive , non-palpable DCIS evidence invasion find diagnostic core needle biopsy ( DCNB ) . In order accrue total 112 participant DCIS period 22 month , 20 eligible participant total screen three participate institution per month plan average monthly recruitment 5 participant total per month . We assume 22 woman ( 20 % recruited population , 11 woman per arm ) inevaluable presence unanticipated invasive disease therapeutic surgical excisional ( TSE ) specimen , absence residual DCIS TSE , total 90 woman ( 45 per arm ) evaluable study endpoint . These estimate base number Lynn Sage Database NU : six-year period 2000-2005 , fraction woman diagnose DCIS core needle biopsy find residual DCIS TSE 2.5 % woman invasive disease ( T1a great ) TSE DCNB show pure DCIS 13.3 % , similar data report Bonnett et . al . [ 56 ] find 13 % pure DCIS lesion see DCNB ( 29/122 ) fact invasive TSE . With regard racial/ethnic group , 25.6 % DCIS population NU non-European ancestry ( 18 % African , 4 % Hispanic , 3.5 % ) . WU high fraction African American woman DCIS ( 24 % 21 % respectively ) . The participant consent follow diagnostic core needle biopsy time initial surgical consultation . Baseline assessment include medical history , nipple aspirate fluid ( NAF ) collection , explanation gel application , BESS questionnaire ( symptom assessment ) blood draw clinical research lab include plasma estradiol , progesterone FSH ( rush ) , CBC , chemistry profile , liver renal function test , Factor VIII , von Willebrand Factor , Factor IX , total protein S , plasma insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-1 ) sex hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG ) , DNA extraction assessment polymorphism tamoxifen metabolism gene . At Northwestern plasma RNA blood collect pre- post-treatment stored future proteomic gene expression fingerprint No run-in period plan . The intervention phase begin within 5 day follow randomization end day prior surgical resection . The 4-OHT group apply active gel 2 mg daily breast 4-10 week take oral placebo . The TAM group take 20 mg TAM orally daily apply gel placebo . The last dose study medication use morning day prior surgery . Participants ship two 100 ml canister 4-OHT placebo gel plus 130 capsule tamoxifen oral placebo time randomization . Participants take study agent 4-10 week ( minimum ) . However , surgery need delay beyond 8 week study period clinical reason ( eg schedule plastic surgery ) participant send additional medication mail allow continuation therapy day surgery maximum duration 10 week . On day prior surgery , baseline assessment repeat ( exception menopausal determination tamoxifen metabolism gene polymorphism , addition blood draw tamoxifen metabolites E Z 4-OHT isomer determination ) . Under unavoidable circumstance , end intervention visit allow day surgery prior TSE . During TSE breast adipose tissue surgical sample snap frozen store -800C measurement TAM metabolites . The paraffin block DCNB TSE sample acquire recruit institution 10 section specimen submit NU Pathology Core Facility ( NU PCF ) . The section cut batch ( pre- post-samples batch ) , ship cold , process immunohistochemistry within week sectioning . Compliance assessment occur patient diary , pill count weigh return drug ( gel ) canister . Patients assessed adverse event post-surgical visit ( approximately 7-14 day surgery ) phone 30 day follow last dose study agent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis hormone receptor positive ( 5 % cell stain ER + and/ PR + ) , grade ( use definition Page Lagios ) ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) without evidence microinvasion diagnostic core needle biopsy within previous 60 day . 2 . Women age ≥ 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use 4hydroxytamoxifen participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric trial , applicable . 3 . ECOG performance status ≥1 ( Karnofsky ≥70 % ) 4 . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : 1 . Leukocytes≥3,000/uL 2 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500/uL 3 . Platelets≥100,000/uL 4 . Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit 5 . AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤1.5 X institutional ULN 6 . Creatinine within normal institutional limit 5 . Women childbearing potential must agree practice barrier birth control , abstinence , use nonhormonal IUDs time first pregnancy test perform throughout duration study three month cessation study drug . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform study physician immediately . 6 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 7 . Ability willingness schedule surgical resection DCIS lesion 410 week ( 2870 day ) follow start study agent . 8 . Willingness avoid expose breast skin natural artificial sunlight ( i.e . tan bed ) 410 week study agent dose . 1 . Prior history , high risk develop , thromboembolic disease exclude . 2 . Must take exogenous sex hormone since biopsy diagnose DCIS must agree use exogenous sex hormone study . 3 . Must take tamoxifen selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs ) within 2 year prior enter study . Women discontinue SERM therapy thromboembolic uterine toxicity , exclude regardless duration use . 4 . May receive investigational agent . 5 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition 4hydroxytamoxifen tamoxifen . 6 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 7 . Pregnant woman exclude study tamoxifen 4hydroxytamoxifen potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Women exclude enrol within 3 month recent pregnancy . Women must avoid become pregnant 3 month follow use study agent . 8 . Women must breastfed within three month prior DCNB . Women breast feed excluded entry trial unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother tamoxifen 4hydroxytamoxifen . Women must agree forego breastfeed three month follow use study agent . 9 . Must dermatologic condition result skin breakdown area gel application . 10 . Must history previous ipsilateral radiation affect breast . 11 . Must breast reduction augmentation within 6 month prior first dose study agent .
