	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To determine recommended Phase 2 dose LY2275796 may safely administer patient advanced cancer , prospect therapeutic biologic effect . This require simultaneous : - monitoring toxicity &amp; determination maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) - detect eIF-4E target inhibition tumor - pharmacokinetic measurement Secondary Objectives : - To estimate pharmacokinetic parameter LY2275796 explore pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship - To document antitumor activity observe LY2275796</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>LY2275796 design block effect cancer-promoting gene call eIF-4E ( eukaryotic initiation factor 4E ) . Before receive drug study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . Your complete medical history record physical exam . You electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . You may also x-ray , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , magnetic resonance imaging , whichever imagine doctor think best monitor status disease . Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test measure drug move around inside body effect body . Your blood sample also test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV , virus cause AIDS ) , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C. If test result show HIV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , notify give information counseling service . The result HIV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C test keep confidential disclose required law . If take test Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , HIV , test positive , eligible study . If 2-week delay begin study , test may need repeat . Within 3 day receive study drug , woman able child must negative blood pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , LY2275796 give infusion vein 3 day . This call loading dose study drug purpose make sure tumor tissue get enough study drug target disease . This dose give either 3 separate 3-hour infusion vein 3 day row nonstop infusion 3 day ( 72 hour ) . The way receive drug decide study doctor study sponsor . This decision base upon dose study drug receive information gather participant already receive study drug . Whichever way receive study drug , may stay hospital first 3 day . Days 1-7 consider Cycle 1 study . After first load dose , continue receive study drug single , 3-hour infusion 1 time week ( call maintenance dose ) . Maintenance dos give Days 8 , 15 , 22 single , 3-hour infusion . Days 8-28 defined Cycle 2 . All cycle begin Cycle 3 28 day . In study , different participant receive different dose level . During first 29 day study , give 16 blood sample ( 1 teaspoon ) pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount study drug blood different time . On Cycle 1 Day 1 , blood drawn 3 hour drug give . On Cycle 1 Day 3 , blood drawn infusion , 1 hour drug give , end infusion , 20 minute , 1 hour , 3 hour , 4-6 hour end infusion . On Cycle 1 Days 4-6 , blood drawn 1 occasion . On Cycle 2 Day 8 , blood drawn infusion , end infusion . On Cycle 2 Day 15 , blood drawn infusion , 3 , 9 , 24 hour later . The last PK test drawn either time biopsy ( Part B C ) next dose study drug give Day 29 . These blood sample use measure amount whole molecule LY2275796 blood . However , small trace LY2275796 may also find . If portion blood leave , use detect broken molecule study drug blood , since test trace may easier way monitor presence LY2275796 blood may better predictor long drug effect body . To test effect drug body , blood sample drawn ( 1 tablespoon ) beginning cycle take LY2275796 . During Part A study , 1 participant enrol time . In part , dos increase quickly , double dose new participant enrol . Participants continue enrol blood test show certain amount study drug participant experience intolerable side effect . Part B begin happen . During Part B study , 3 participant give dose study drug . If 3 participant tolerate dose study drug well , another 3 participant enrol high dose . These dose increase continue tumor biopsy show drug require effect cancer 3 participant 1 dose ( call optimal biologic dose , OBD ) . However , 2 participant 1 dose experience intolerable side effect , additional participant enrol slightly low dos high well tolerate dose identify ( call maximum tolerate dose , MTD ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Once MTD OBD find , Part C begin . Ten ( 10 ) participant enrol Part C. OBD MTD dose find Part B . If enrol Part B Part C , tumor biopsy . If tumor felt skin , biopsy may do local anesthetic use numb skin . If tumor detectable touch , would biopsy perform help CT scan ultrasound . The first biopsy within 4 week start LY2275796 . You 1 biopsy 21-28 day start take LY2275796 . The first biopsy take receive study drug get baseline evaluation tumor . The biopsy take receive study drug check level study drug tumor also see drug work cancer cell expect . On day receive load dose weekly maintenance dos , doctor perform physical exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw measure effect LY2275796 blood count , blood chemistry , ability blood clot , liver kidney function , possibly check tumor . If need , extra sample may draw check blood level LY2275796 . You take study intolerable side effect disease get bad . When go study , physical exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw measure effect LY2275796 blood count , blood chemistry , ability blood clot , liver kidney function , possibly check tumor . You image study perform study monitor status disease . You also require visit doctor 30 day last dose LY2275796 follow-up test . You physical exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw measure effect LY2275796 blood count , blood chemistry , ability blood clot , liver kidney function , possibly check tumor . You image study perform study monitor status disease . You also ask side effect experience . If side effect , visit doctor every 30 day side effect stop begin new cancer treatment . If side effect LY2275796 , follow-up necessary study . This investigational study . LY2275796 FDA approve commercially available , authorize use research . About 40 patient may participate multicenter study . About 20 patient enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

Presence positive test result HIV antibody , Hepatitis B surface antigen , Hepatitis C antibody ( Rationale : Correlative biologic study entail aerosolization biologic fluid . Researchers use Universal precaution protect HIV Hepatitis virus . However , robotic equipment handle specimen high viral load would require purge sterilization procedure could damage equipment alter result subsequent specimen . Patients lack symptom sign HIV hepatitis low viral load screen necessary ) .</criteria>
