	<brief_summary>Overactive bladder ( OAB ) define `` urgency , without urge incontinence , usually frequency nocturia '' absence local pathological endocrine factor . Urgency define `` complaint sudden compelling desire pas urine difficult defer '' abnormal sensation distinctly different normal physiologic feel 'urge void ' occurs typical bladder-filling cycle . Because 50 % patient OAB experience urgency without incontinence , urgency bothersome symptom drive behavioral adaptation frequent void fear urgency , cornerstone symptom OAB indicate diagnosis OAB . Even though effective treatment OAB must reduce patient 's sense urgency , subjective nature make difficult measure . Therefore , clinical efficacy OAB treatment traditionally measure term objective surrogate parameter instead urgency : example , change urinary frequency , incontinent episode , number pad urodynamically proven detrusor overactivity , could measure easily quantifiably . Recently , several method measure urgency develop used clinical practice . However , analysis question clinical significance result ; possible reason lack data base urinary urgency use sensitive patient-driven criterion . Propiverine hydrochloride ( 1-methyl-4-piperidyl diphenylpropoxyacetate hydrochloride ) drug combine antimuscarinic calcium antagonistic action . Previous trial clinical efficacy safety propiverine treat patient OAB report improvement urinary frequency incontinence , urgency . The aim study explore efficacy daily regimen propiverine 20 mg ( immediate release formulation ) improve urgency baseline 12 week treatment patient OAB .</brief_summary>
