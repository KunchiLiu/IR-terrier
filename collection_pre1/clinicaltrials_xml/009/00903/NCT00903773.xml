	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect severe renal impairment failure single-dose pharmacokinetics telaprevir ( TVR ) . Pharmacokinetics mean drug absorb bloodstream , distribute body eliminate body . In addition , effect severe renal impairment total unbound plasma concentration sum TVR R-diastereomer VRT-127394 assess . ( Diastereomers substance whose chemical structure mirror image ) . Finally , short-term safety tolerability TVR participant severe kidney disease determine . The result study guide dose recommendation TVR subject kidney disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label trial investigate single-dose pharmacokinetics telaprevir ( TVR ) 12 participant severe renal impairment ( defined creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) &lt; 30 mL/min ) compare 12 participant normal renal function , match sex , race , age ( ± 10 year ) BMI ( ± 20 % ) . Open-label mean study doctor participant know treatment assign . All participant receive single 750-mg dose TVR . Pharmacokinetic profile total TVR 24 hour postdose determine . A 24 hour urine collection test perform estimate CrCl . In addition , effect severe renal impairment total unbound plasma concentration sum TVR VRT-127394 assess . Tolerability safety TVR assess throughout trial period . Illnesses side effect check every visit . Blood urine sample take screening , Day 1 , 2 2 follow-up visit . ECG vital sign take screening , twice day 1 , day 2 first follow-up visit . At second follow-up visit vital sign alone determine . A physical examination do screening , day TVR intake , day 2 follow-up visit . All participant receive single 750-mg dose telaprevir ( TVR ) give mouth 2 tablet 375 mg .</detailed_description>
