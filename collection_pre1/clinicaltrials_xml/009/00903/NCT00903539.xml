	<brief_summary>To prospectively monitor safety performance catheter securement device subject whose catheter secure Interrad Medical SecureAcath device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective SecurAcath Subcutaneous Securement Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripherally inserted central catheter ( PICCs ) Central Venous Catheter ( CVC ) widely use deliver fluid directly central venous system remain place short day long month . One high risk use catheter infection , local systemic . Currently , catheter secure either suture adhesive patch . Sutures create additional potential entry point bacteria whereas suture adhesive securement patch hold catheter hub skin result increase difficulty clean around catheter entry site . Furthermore , secure catheter outside skin away catheter entry point , suture adhesive securement patch may potentiate pistoning catheter also believe possibly increase infection risk . A second risk intravenous catheter use dislodgement normal use site maintenance . These catheter often manipulate multiple time day blood sample injection fluid . During manipulation , catheter dislodge thus require unplanned replacement catheter . Interrad Medical develop mean secure indwell catheter use small subcutaneous anchor . With system , clean around catheter entry site make easy thorough . The system also design minimize risk catheter dislodgement anchor deploy , catheter remain secure . This may simplify dress change compare adhesive device Statlock , require catheter release device therefore unsecured dressing change . The objective post-market study monitor safety performance SecurAcath use secure catheter insertion site via subcutaneous anchor . The data collect may provide insight future enhancement improve safety utility device . It also provide mean early warning identify safety issue , allows physician share experience thereby improve quality care provide patient .</detailed_description>
