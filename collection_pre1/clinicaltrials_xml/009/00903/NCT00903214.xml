	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tumor tissue blood patient cancer laboratory may help doctor identify biomarkers related cancer . Riluzole may help slow growth tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study riluzole woman stage I , stage II , stage IIIA breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Riluzole Women With Stage I , Stage II , Stage IIIA Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate effect glutamate receptor blockade riluzole cellular pathway important genesis progression disease woman stage I-IIIA breast cancer examine component mGluR1 signal pathway pre- post-treatment tumor sample determine glutamate blockade affect signal pathway . Secondary - To determine whether treatment riluzole affect proliferation apoptosis manner suggest potential therapeutic effectiveness . - To determine whether treatment riluzole cause objectively measurable tumor shrinkage . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral riluzole twice daily day -14 0 . Approximately 12 hour completion riluzole therapy patient undergo standard surgery ( i.e. , partial total mastectomy ) along sentinel lymph node biopsy ( patient node-negative disease ) full axillary dissection ( patient node-positive disease ) day 0 . Patients undergo 3-dimensional image assessment pre- post-treatment Computerized Ultrasound Risk Evaluation ( C.U.R.E. ) . Patients undergo core needle biopsy baseline surgery biomarker analysis ( e.g. , mGluR1 ) IHC , western blotting , RT-PCR . Blood sample collect GRM1 polymorphism analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 1 year accord standard-of-care thereafter .</detailed_description>
