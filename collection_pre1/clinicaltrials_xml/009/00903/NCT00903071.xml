	<brief_summary>In project investigator implement test ability Personalized Physician Learning ( PPL ) intervention improve hypertension ( HT ) care follow specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : Implement two version Personalized Physician Learning ( PPL ) intervention assess ability intervention improve hypertension control primary care practice . - Hypothesis 1 : Patients physician receive REAL+PPL Intervention ( Group 1 ) subsequently well HT control compare patient control group physician ( Group 3 ) . - Hypothesis 2 : Patients physician receive SIM+PPL Intervention ( Group 2 ) subsequently well HT control compare patient control group physician ( Group 3 ) . - Hypothesis 3 : Patients physician receive REAL+PPL ( Group 1 ) subsequently well HT control compare patient physician receive SIM+PPL ( Group 2 ) . Specific Aim 2 : Assess cost-effectiveness SIM+PPL REAL+PPL intervention , relative intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective project improve hypertension ( HT ) control implement two Personalized Physician Learning intervention design primary care physician ( PCPs ) . Improved HT control long identify major national health care priority uncontrolled HT lead cause stroke ( CVA ) , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , myocardial infarction ( MI ) , adverse health event . The cost uncontrolled HT sequela estimate least $ 100 billion dollar year U.S. , minimal improvement HT care recent decade . Currently , estimate 68 million Americans HT , 42 million remain uncontrolled . Personalized Physician Learning ( PPL ) intervention powerful enough change physician behavior improve HT care . The PPL intervention project direct individual primary care physician ( PCPs ) use simple 3-step approach : ( ) Analyze physician 's pre-intervention pattern HT care identify specific failure physician decision make HT care , ( b ) Provide physician series personalize HT learn case design correct failure decision make result physician 's observed pattern HT care . Learning case provide iterative on-screen feedback blood pressure ( BP ) change response sequence change therapy , expert-generated suggestion well HT care , adaptive selection subsequent case identify error decision making master . ( c ) Assess intervention impact care actual patient HT post-intervention period , ass transfer learn simulated office practice environment . The PPL intervention strategy base recent work cognitive science learn theory successfully apply research educational setting , although yet apply HT care .</detailed_description>
