	<brief_summary>The purpose research understand property mucus person COPD , specifically Chronic Bronchitis . We hypothesize Chronic Bronchitis dehydrate mucus , thus hard time cough lung . This lead great vulnerability lung infection , inflammation airflow obstruction . Ultimately , goal understand mucus dehydration contribute progression COPD/Chronic Bronchitis good therapy intervention develop future generation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim I directly test hypothesis mucus clearance impair due mucus dehydration . It measure 1 ) COPD Mucociliary Cough Clearance 2 ) mucus hydration 3 ) concentration dominant regulator airway hydration 4 ) consequence mucus dehydration mucus biophysical property bacterial infection . Specific Aim II test hypothesis COPD acute exacerbation associate failure mucus clearance . Measurements similar Specific Aim I , conduct period baseline health , acute exacerbation recovery . Specific Aim III test whether airway surface hydration 7 % Hypertonic Saline restore clearance basal state COPD acute exacerbation . COPD subject expose inhaled Hypertonic Saline period baseline health acute exacerbation . Acute efficacy via measure mucus clearance spirometry study .</detailed_description>
