	<brief_title>Examining Hair Determine Tenofovir Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) new strategy prevention HIV infection . It involve provide antiretroviral medications—those treat HIV infections—to people expose HIV . In clinical trial PrEP , several currently way , accurate measurement need much exposure participant PrEP medication . Current method , self-reports medication adherence pill counting , lead inaccurate reading PrEP exposure participant may forget take pill individual difference may affect level exposure . Measuring PrEP exposure level hair yield objective marker exposure subject self-report error take account individual difference . This study test use hair sample assess level exposure tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) , antiretroviral medication , people infect HIV . Participation study last 9 month . Participants undergo baseline test randomly assign begin one three condition , base dose schedule : receiving TDF 2 , 4 , 7 day per week . All participant complete dose schedule , order complete randomly assign . Each dose schedule last 6 week , break several week . During dose schedule , study staff confirm participant take schedule dose watch take pill weekdays call weekend . Follow-up visit occur Days 1 , 21 , 42 dosing schedule . During baseline follow-up visit , follow complete : HIV rapid test ; counsel HIV prevention ; brief physical exam ; talk staff member health , symptom , medication ; blood draw , use several test ; collection urine sample pregnancy test ; optional donation sample pubic hair . On last day dose schedule , small sample hair cut participant 's scalp . An additional follow-up visit occur participant complete 4 week 7-day dosing schedule . This visit last 24 hour involve collection additional blood sample .</detailed_description>
