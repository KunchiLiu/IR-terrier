	<brief_summary>The purpose research determine whether treat atrial fibrillation surgical ablation schedule mitral valve surgery well mitral valve surgery without surgical ablation . Surgical ablation atrial fibrillation technique use surgeon deaden atrial heart tissue block electrical signal may cause heart beat irregularly . There new procedure test study ; mitral valve surgery surgical ablation use regularly patient mitral valve problem atrial fibrillation , although surgical ablation device approve Food Drug Administration treatment atrial fibrillation . What known certainty , whether patient atrial fibrillation plan mitral valve surgery would better also surgical ablation rather medication alone treat atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine whether addition surgical ablation plan mitral valve surgery patient persistent longstanding persistent AF ( within 6 month prior randomization ) reduce incidence postoperative heart arrhythmia compare mitral valve repair medication therapy alone . This randomized , multi-center trial enroll 260 subject randomize 1:1 fashion : ( ) mitral valve surgery plus surgical ablation ( b ) mitral valve surgery without ablation ( control group ) . All patient undergo ligation excision leave atrial appendage . Patients assigned ablation group randomize ( 1:1 ) one two lesion set : ( 1 ) pulmonary vein isolation ( 2 ) biatrial Maze lesion . The target population trial consist adult patient mitral valve disease require surgical intervention persistent longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation . All patient meet eligibility criterion may include study regardless gender , race ethnicity . The primary efficacy endpoint freedom AF , measure 3-day continuous monitor 6 month 12 month post-ablation . The primary safety endpoint composite death , stroke , serious cardiac event ( heart failure , myocardial infarction ) , cardiac re-hospitalizations , transient ischemic attack , pulmonary embolism , peripheral embolism , excessive bleeding , deep sternal wound infection/mediastinitis , damage specialize conduction system require permanent pacemaker , damage peripheral structure , esophagus , within 30 day post-procedure hospital discharge ( whichever later ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Able sign Informed Consent Release Medical Information form Age â‰¥ 18 year Clinical indication mitral valve surgery following : 1 . Organic mitral valve disease ; 2 . Functional nonischemic mitral regurgitation ; 3 . Ischemic mitral regurgitation evidence concomitant structural mitral valve disease Note : May include need surgical management functional tricuspid regurgitation patent foramen ovale . May also include concomitant CABG , aortic arch aortic valve procedure . Surgical intervention may perform via sternotomy minimally invasive procedure . ) Persistent AF within 6 month prior randomization , define non selfterminating AF last great 7 day one year , last less 7 day necessitate pharmacologic electrical cardioversion . Duration AF must document medical history Presence AF must document direct electrocardiographic assessment within 6 month prior randomization . b ) Longstanding persistent AF define continuous AF great one year duration . Duration AF must document medical history Presence AF must document direct electrocardiographic assessment upon arrival OR . Able use heart rhythm monitor 1 . AF without indication mitral valve surgery 2 . AF paroxysmal 3 . Evidence leave atrial thrombus intraoperative TEE 4 . Evidence active infection 5 . Mental impairment condition may allow subject understand nature , significance , scope study 6 . Surgical management hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy 7 . Previous catheter ablation AF 8 . Life expectancy less one year 9 . Absolute contraindication anticoagulation therapy 10 . Enrollment concomitant drug device trial 11 . Uncontrolled hypo hyperthyroidism 12 . FEV1 &lt; 30 % predict value and/or need home oxygen therapy 13 . Women pregnant evidence positive pregnancy test 14 . Women childbearing age agree adequate birth control throughout period trial .</criteria>
