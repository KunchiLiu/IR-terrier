	<brief_title>Decitabine Clofarabine Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Decitabine design damage cell ' DNA ( genetic material ) , may cause myelodysplastic marrow cell work like normal marrow cell . Clofarabine design interfere growth development abnormal marrow cell . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . - If Group 1 , receive decitabine clofarabine . - If Group 2 , receive decitabine . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 4-8 week depend tolerate drug MDS respond . Group 1 : If Group 1 , receive drug alternate series cycle . This mean receive decitabine first 3 cycle , clofarabine next 3 cycle , repeat . This pattern continue 24 cycle . On Days 1-5 Cycles 1-3 , 7-9 , 13-15 , 19-21 , receive decitabine vein 1-2 hour . On Days 1-5 Cycles 4-6 , 10-12 , 16-18 , 22-24 , receive clofarabine vein 1-2 hour . Group 2 : If Group 2 , receive decitabine vein 1-2 hour Days 1-5 every cycle . Study Visits : On Day 1 every cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . Once week , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . At end Cycle 3 , bone marrow aspirate check status disease . If disease go remission Cycle 3 , next bone marrow aspirate depend group . If Group 1 , may another aspirate 3 week begin Cycle 4 . After , may aspirate every 2 week ( often doctor feel need ) response ( lack thereof ) confirm . If Group 2 , may another bone marrow aspirate end Cycle 6 . You need stay Houston receive study drug ( ) . When study visit receive study drug ( ) , test perform local doctor . If MD Anderson leukemia doctor approves , study drug administer outside MD Anderson local doctor . Length Study : You study 24 cycle . You take study early disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . Follow-up Visits : After last dose study drug , follow-up visit . You visit disease respond study drug . - Once month , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . This do home local cancer doctor . - Every 6 month , return Houston physical exam blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . This investigational study . Clofarabine FDA approve commercially available use pediatric patient type blood cancer ( acute lymphocytic leukemia -- ALL ) . Its use patient MDS investigational . Decitabine FDA approve commercially available use patient MDS . Up 80 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
