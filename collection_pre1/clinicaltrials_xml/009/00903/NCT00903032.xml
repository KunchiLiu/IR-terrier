	<brief_summary>We propose test effectiveness multi-faceted patient-centered adherence intervention among veteran follow ACS hospitalization improve adherence cardioprotective medication ( primary aim ) . Secondary aim ass whether intervention improve achievement secondary prevention blood pressure ( BP ) low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) -cholesterol goal , reduces cardiac endpoint ( myocardial infarction ) MI hospitalization , coronary revascularization , all-cause mortality ) cost-effective . ANTICIPATED IMPACT ( S ) : If successful , propose intervention increase adherence cardioprotective medication ( i.e. , -blockers , statin , clopidogrel , ACE inhibitor ) help veteran take medication routinely prescribe , quality cardiovascular care veteran help patient achieve BP LDL goal associate improved outcome , efficiency care use telephone call tele-monitoring communication patient rather clinic visit . The finding study address important gap knowledge ( i.e. , improve adherence medication follow ACS discharge ) generalizable VA Medical Centers veteran .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient-Centered Adherence Intervention After Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) Hospitalization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE : Acute coronary syndrome , include acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) one lead cause hospitalization veteran . Recent advance treatment acute MI lead decline hospital mortality . Despite , risk recurrent event mortality index MI hospitalization remain substantial follow year . Non-adherence proven cardioprotective medication potentially modifiable risk factor contribute persistently high risk adverse outcome follow MI hospitalization . Prior intervention improve medication adherence cardiovascular population produce mixed result specifically targeted patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) hospital discharge . It currently unknown intervention target medication non-adherence year ACS discharge improve medication adherence intermediate outcome cost-effective OBJECTIVE ( S ) : We propose test effectiveness multi-faceted patient-centered adherence intervention among veteran follow ACS hospitalization improve adherence cardioprotective medication ( primary aim ) . Secondary aim ass whether intervention improve achievement secondary prevention blood pressure ( BP ) LDL-cholesterol goal , reduces cardiac endpoint ( MI hospitalization , coronary revascularization , all-cause mortality ) cost-effective . METHODS : We propose 3-year , multi-site patient-level randomize control trial evaluate , relative usual care , multi-faceted patient-centered intervention improve adherence cardioprotective medication among veteran follow ACS hospital discharge . The study enroll 280 patient intervention versus usual care 12-months 3 VA Medical Centers ( Eastern Colorado , Pudget Sound , Central Arkansas ) . The propose intervention base several conceptual framework ( Chronic Care Model Medication Adherence Model ) adapt element prior successfully adherence intervention , include : collaborative care , patient education , tailor medication regimen , tele-monitoring . The primary analysis comparison adherence cardioprotective medication use pharmacy refill record base ReCOMP adherence measure develop VA . Secondary analysis compare achievement secondary prevention BP LDL goal cardiac event . In addition , cost-effectiveness analysis perform . All analyse intention treat</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient admit acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) primary reason hospital admission use VA usual source care , define 1 primary care visit within 12 month prior hospital admission screen eligibility participate . ACS define acute myocardial infarction ( STelevation MI nonST elevation MI ) unstable angina . The presence acute myocardial infarction define use standard definition international consensus statement , base following : rise and/or fall cardiac biomarkers ( preferably troponin ) least one value 99th percentile upper reference limit least one following : symptom ischemia ; ECG change indicative new ischemia ( new STT change new left bundle branch block ) ; development pathological Q wave ECG ; image evidence new loss viable myocardium new regional wall motion abnormality.42 Unstable angina define presence ischemic symptom ECG change indicative new ischemia without biomarker evidence myonecrosis ( i.e. , biomarker elevation ) evidence new pathological Q wave , loss viable myocardium regional wall motion abnormality . Patient admit primary noncardiac diagnosis develop ACS secondary condition ( e.g . perioperative MI ) ; plan discharge nursing home skilled nursing facility ; irreversible , noncardiac medical condition ( e.g . metastatic cancer ) likely affect 6month survival ability execute study protocol ; lack telephone/cell phone ; VA primary source care ; regularly fill medication nonVA pharmacy .</criteria>
