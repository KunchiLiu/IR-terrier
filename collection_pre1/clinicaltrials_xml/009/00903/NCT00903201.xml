	<brief_title>28 Day Repeat Dose Cystic Fibrosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proof mechanism study aim evaluate safety , tolerability pharmacodynamics SB-656933 follow 28 day daily administration 20 50 mg SB-656933 patient CF compare placebo . The primary endpoint study effect SB-656933 safety tolerability ( adverse event , vital sign , clinical laboratory assessment , 12-lead electrocardiogram , urinalysis ) follow 28 day dose . Secondary endpoint include level neutrophil elastase induce sputum sputum marker inflammation ( e.g . myeloperoxidase , total protein ) , induce sputum cell ( i.e . total sputum neutrophil count , percent sputum neutrophil ) sputum microbiology . Other assessment include lung function measurement ( spirometry ) ; serum plasma marker inflammation ( e.g . fibrinogen , CC-16 , CRP , MMP8 , MMP9 , SP-D , CXCL-8 ) , quality life questionnaire , population pharmacokinetics parameter SB-656933</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis CF base following : sweat chloride &gt; 60 mEq/L and/or genotype 2 identifiable mutation consistent CF ; ( ΔF508 homozygote , ΔF508 heterozygote second allele know cause disease , two allele know cause class I , II , III mutation ) one clinical feature consistent CF . Male female subject age ≥18 year age A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] . Childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method list Section 8.1.1 appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception one week last dose . Patients nonsmoker former smoker history . Former smoker define smoked ≥6 month . Subjects use chew tobacco product may enrol discretion Investigator consultation GSK medical monitor . In judgement investigator patient clinically stable change symptom medication , admission hospital , intravenous antibiotic therapy least 1 month prior dose . Able perform lung function test reliably . FEV1 &gt; 40 % &lt; 110 % predict . Excluding period exacerbation , FEV1 decrease &gt; 15 % past 12 month Clinically colonize bacterial organism commonly see cystic fibrosis Burkholderia cepacia ( i.e . Pseudomonas spp. , Staphylococcus aureus , Stenotrophomonas , B. Gladioli ) evidence identification sputum culture within past year . To eligible CF patient must colonization least one typical CF organism . To eligible , female patient must negative pregnancy test ( urine serum ) nursing screen prior dosing . Subjects must QTcB QTcF &lt; 450 msec screening determine investigator review . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) within twice ( 2x ) upper limit normal screen bilirubin within 1.25x ULN screening . AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &gt; 2.0 xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 2.0xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Male subject must agree use one contraception method list Section 8.1.2 . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication one week last dose . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . The subject able understand comply protocol requirement , instruction protocolstated restriction . Any clinically relevant abnormality identify screen medical assessment , laboratory examination , ECG , associate cystic fibrosis . Neutrophil count &lt; 1.5x109 /L In judgment PI , patient : suffers clinically unstable pancreatic function clinically significant weight loss ( ≥5 % previously stable period ) . recent change pancreatic enzyme requirement past 2 month . Recent viral infection ( within 4 week dose ) , without steroid antibiotic treatment . Presumed viral infection determine accord judgment Investigator specific test virus require . Subjects unable produce technically acceptable sputum sample . Clinically significant hepatic impairment Evidence cirrhosis Patients elevate INR due suspect vitamin K deficiency may enrol discretion Investigator consultation GSK medical monitor Blood pressure persistently &gt; 155/95 mmHg screening . Positive HIV , Hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C antibody screen . History regular alcohol consumption average &gt; 7 drinks/week woman &gt; 14 drinks/week men . One drink equivalent ( 12 g alcohol ) = 5 ounce ( 150 ml ) wine 12 ounce ( 360 ml ) beer 1.5 ounce ( 45 ml ) 80 proof distil spirit ) within 6 month screen . Urinary cotinine level indicative smoking . Use oral parenteral corticosteroid within 4 week screen ; regular use ( &gt; 3 x/wk ) high dose NSAIDS ( e.g . &gt; 1.6g ibuprofen/day regular basis ) , within 4 week screen . Colonization Burkholderia cepacia Subjects currently treat mycobacterial infection Subjects presume active Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis ( ABPA ) Subjects newly start therapy azithromycin within past 3 month . In judgment investigator , clinically significant hemoptysis ( &gt; 30 cc per episode ) within last 6 month Donation blood excess 500 mL within 56day period prior dose Participation trial drug within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) , participation trial new chemical entity within 2 month prior first dose current study medication , unless opinion Investigator sponsor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . The subject positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . A minimum list drug screen include amphetamine , barbiturate , cocaine , opiates , cannabinoids . Subjects use benzodiazepine anxiolytic regular basis include discretion investigator consultation GSK medical monitor Patients may inhale antibiotic study ( i.e . must `` offTOBI '' month ; cessation TOBI inhale antibiotic commences one week prior dose final PK draw ) . Patients maintenance therapy hypertonic saline solution inhale DNase may continue therapy . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol .</criteria>
