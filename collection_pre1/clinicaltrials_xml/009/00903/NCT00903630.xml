	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Lenalidomide may stop growth cancer block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving lenalidomide together doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide give together doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome treat patient recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Phase I - Primary - To determine maximum tolerate dose lenalidomide combine fix dose pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride woman recurrent ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . Phase II - Define best overall response induce lenalidomide recurrent ovarian cancer patient Secondary - To obtain preliminary information toxicity , response , time progression ( duration response ) patient . - Progression free survival Phase I OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study lenalidomide . Patients receive oral lenalidomide daily day 1-28 pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Phase II OUTLINE : The phase II component include patient measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion treat lenalidomide 10 mg day 1-28 day 28 day cycle ( Maximum Tolerated Dose phase I ) liposomal doxorubicin 40 mg/m^2 determine efficacy safety combination therapy . ( Effective April 2010 revision ) After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
