	<brief_summary>Currently investigator two different class second-line treatment option recurrent non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) . In chemotherapy , docetaxel pemetrexed produce similar treatment efficacy outcome , pemetrexed good tolerability . In recent analysis pemetrexed clinical study , strong treatment-by-histology interaction overall survival progression free survival indicate good efficacy non-squamous patient treat pemetrexed . These data support pemetrexed could preferable chemotherapy drug especially adenocarcinoma NSCLC patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tailored Second Line Treatment Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) Mutation Patients With Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On hand , EGFR TKI ( gefitinib erlotinib ) produce somewhat similar high response rate ( around 25 % ) general Taiwan adenocarcinoma NSCLC patient , median overall survival time n't longer chemotherapy treated patient . A recent prospective study gefitinib chemonaive adenocarcinoma NSCLC patient show objective response rate lower 1.1 % among EGFR mutation negative patient . Since typical EGFR gene mutation ( i.e. , deletion typically five amino acid codon 746-750 ( ELREA ) exon 19 leucine-to-arginine mutation codon 858 ( L858R ) ) good predictor tumor response tyrosine kinase inhibitor , present study tailor patient 's treatment accord his/her EGFR gene mutation status . Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( erlotinib study ) suggest second-line drug recommendation typical EGFR gene mutation patient , chemotherapy ( pemetrexed study ) suggest second-line drug recommendation EGFR wild type patient . The aim study increase overall tumor response rate 40 % current treatment outcome ( around 25 % ) tailor second line treatment . The interest study include prospectively evaluate predictivity EGFR gene mutation tumor response . The primary objective study determine overall tumor response rate tailor second line treatment determine typical EGFR gene mutation patient advance lung adenocarcinoma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic diagnosis adenocarcinoma NSCLC . Locally advance metastatic disease ( stage IIIB IV ) , define American Joint Committee Cancer Staging Criteria NSCLC ( Fleming et al . 1997 ; Mountain 1997 ) Patients must previously receive one chemotherapy regimen palliative therapy locally advance metastatic disease . NOTE : Firstline therapy tyrosine kinase inhibitor alone regimens include pemetrexed , docetaxel , cetuximab , trastuzumab allow enrollment study . Prior chemotherapy earlier stage disease allow , single regimen allow prior palliative therapy locally advance metastatic disease . Prior chemotherapy must complete least 2 week prior study enrollment patient must recover acute toxic effect treatment . Disease status must measurable disease define RECIST criterion ( Therasse et al . 2000 ) . Performance status 0 2 ECOG Scale ( See Protocol Attachment 2. ) . Estimated life expectancy least 8 week . Adequate organ function include follow : Bone marrow : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) 1.5* 109/L , platelet 100*109/L , hemoglobin 9 g/dL . Hepatic : bilirubin 1.5ULN , AST ALT 2.5 ULN ( AST , ALT 5 ULN acceptable liver tumor involvement ) . Renal : serum creatine 1.5 ULN ; Calculated creatinine clearance 45 mL/min ( use standard CockcroftGault formula ; Cockcroft Gault 1976 ) . For woman : Must surgically sterile , postmenopausal , compliant medically approve contraceptive regimen 6 month treatment period ; must negative serum urine pregnancy test must lactate . For men : Must surgically sterile , compliant contraceptive regimen 6 month treatment period . Men woman least 20 year age , sign informed consent patient . Subject untreated brain meningeal metastasis . CT scan require rule brain meningeal metastases unless clinical suspicion central nervous system disease ) . Subjects treat brain metastasis radiographically clinically stable least 2 week therapy evidence cavitation hemorrhage brain lesion eligible provide asymptomatic . Have previously complete withdrawn study , receive pemetrexed , thymidylate synthetase dihydrofolate reductase previously outside study . Concurrent administration tumor therapy . Active infection ( discretion investigator ) . History significant neurological mental disorder , include seizure dementia . Second primary malignancy clinically detectable within 5 year consideration study enrollment . Have receive treatment within last 30 day drug receive regulatory approval ( e.g. , warfarin Coumadin ) indication time study entry . Inability interrupt aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) 2 day , day , 2 day dose pemetrexed . If patient take NSAID ( Cox2 inhibitor include ) salicylate long halflife ( e.g. , naproxen , piroxicam , diflunisal , nabumetone , rofecoxib , celecoxib ) take 5 day , day , 2 day dose pemetrexed . Inability unwillingness take erlotinib , folic acid , vitamin B12 supplementation , dexamethasone .</criteria>
