	<brief_summary>The aim study enroll 785 eligible stage II colon cancer patient order validate performance ColoPrint estimate 3-year relapse rate . Secondary objective include compare objective risk assessment result prognostic profile ( ColoPrint ) risk assessment base ASCO criterion , well Investigator 's independent assessment . As first prospective study ColoPrint , study also address logistics quality assurance use ColoPrint clinical practice . Patient treatment discretion physician , adhere National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) -approved regimen recognize alternative . The enrollment period 6 year . It expect 1800 2400 patient enrol order obtain 785 analysable stage II sample eligible patient . Approximately 25-35 clinical site involve worldwide . The statistical analysis perform Agendia independent research institute hospital . Study Design Extension Study : This prospective study measure impact ColoPrint adjuvant treatment stage 2 colorectal cancer patient . After surgery tumor sample ship RNA Retain Agendia . The online Clinical Report Form ( CRF ) 0 complete document patient fulfil inclusion criterion . Baseline clinical data patient physician chemotherapy intention , patient 's perceived recurrence risk decisional conflict without know ColoPrint result enter CRF 1 . After completion CRF1 ColoPrint result release . CRF2 complete final treatment decision make . This CRF capture patient physician chemotherapy intention , patient 's perceived recurrence risk decisional conflict , impact ColoPrint actual treatment patient receive . CRF3 complete 12 month enrolment capture patient status , patient 's perceived recurrence risk decisional conflict . CRF4 5 complete 3 5 year surgery capture patient status . A sample size 210 stage 2 colon cancer patient require detect 10 % overall treatment change ( 5 % significance 90 % power ) . Reporting Results : Blinded Study ; The ColoPrint result report physician and/or patient time enrolment . All sample store freezer 550-575 eligible stage II patient enrol . Samples analyze one batch blind fashion clinical result . Extension Study ; The ColoPrint result report physician patient CRF1 complete .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective • To validate performance ColoPrint estimate 3-year relapse rate patient stage II colorectal cancer . Secondary Objectives • To assess feasibility use ColoPrint test clinical setting . - To compare risk assessment stage II patient use ColoPrint profile v clinical risk assessment base 1 ) Investigator 's assessment risk 2 ) ASCO high-risk recommendation ( T4 lesion , perforation / obstruction , inadequate node sample ( le 12 node ) poorly differentiate histology ) . - To establish proportion low-risk high-risk ColoPrint profile stage II colorectal cancer patient various country . - To investigate therapy potential confounding factor ColoPrint result . - To assess performance ColoPrint estimate 3-year relapse rate patient stage III colorectal cancer . - To compare performance ColoPrint v clinical risk assessment estimate 5-year relapse rate . - Assess impact ColoPrint adjuvant chemotherapy treatment decision stage 2 colorectal cancer patient - Compare ColoPrint result fresh RNARetain colorectal tumor specimen match formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue ( FFPE ) colon tumor specimens concordance .</detailed_description>
