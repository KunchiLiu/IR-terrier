	<detailed_description>A total approximately 140 woman recruit study ( 70 patient extended-release oxybutynin chloride group 70 patient placebo group ) . Safety assess pre- post- study physical examination , laboratory analysis , adverse event vital sign . The primary endpoint study change daily frequency moderate severe hot flush baseline Week 12 ( correspond visit 6 schedule day 78 day 84 ) change severity moderate severe hot flush baseline Week 12 . Daily severity score moderate severe hot flash sum moderate hot flash time 2 severe hot flash ( include wake episode ) time 3 divide total number moderate severe hot flash day . Baseline severity average daily severity score 14 day first dose study medication . Week 12 severity average daily severity score 7 day Visit 6 7 day include last double-blind dose subject withdraws Visit 6 . The baseline value daily frequency define total number moderate severe hot flash record pre-randomization period divide number day correspond period complete diary receive . The daily frequency Week 12 define total number moderate severe hot flash record last 7 day prior last dose study medication divide number day week complete diary receive . The secondary endpoint include change daily frequency moderate severe hot flash baseline Week 4 , change severity moderate severe hot flash baseline Week 4 , change daily composite score moderate severe hot flash baseline Week 4 Week 12 , change daily frequency hot flash baseline Week 4 Week 12 , change severity hot flash baseline Week 4 Week 12 , change daily composite score hot flash baseline Week 4 Week 12 .
