	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine plerixafor make cell sensitive kill cytarabine daunorubicin , anti-cancer drug regimen refer `` 7+3 '' commonly use treat acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . In study , plerixafor use treatment cytarabine daunorubicin without granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( GCSF ) . Subjects monitor see well tolerate use drug together well work treat leukemia . The purpose study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) per plerixafor dosing schedule ( daily [ QD ] twice daily [ BID ] ) , and/or recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) , assess safety tolerability plerixafor ( Mozobil® ) use combination cytarabine daunorubicin , without granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF )</brief_summary>
