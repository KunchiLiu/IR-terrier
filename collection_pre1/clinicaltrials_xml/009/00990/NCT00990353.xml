	<brief_summary>This study examine method well predict improvement hidden disability functional vision , spatial neglect , follow stroke . Spatial neglect tendency make visual judgment movement error mislocating body object space . The investigator use specialized statistical method compute proportion improvement account personal characteristic stroke survivor , proportion improvement account unique visual-spatial error make subject , proportion improvement account treatment administer . The investigator also examine whether brain imaging predicts rapidly improvement occurs . Lastly , study test whether improvement meaningful survivor measure way still allow detection small scientifically eloquent performance change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DESCRIPTION : Spatial neglect , pathologically asymmetric spatial behavior result brain injury ( Heilman , 1979 ) cause functional disability ( Barrett Burkholder , 2006 ) may occur 20-50 % stroke , 350,000 Americans annually ( Ringman et al. , 2004 ; American Stroke Assoc. , 2007 ) . Difficulty eating , dress , navigate complex environment occur acutely disorder , even symptom improve chronic recovery , people spatial neglect likely lose functional independence ( Katz et al. , 1999 ) . Current standard clinical approach theory drive , widely-employed therapy may marginally effective . In proposal , suggest two mean scientific acute spatial neglect treatment implement . In available study , subject heterogeneity may obscure treatment effect . Across method , study use single subject , case series , group analytic design , attempt reconcile distinct advantage offer individual versus group analytic approach . Different treatment might affect different spatial cognitive recovery function , simple , global outcome measure may reflect change . Modeling subject-specific group effect also extremely useful method examine target treatment effect . We collect spatial neglect treatment response data four year , two promise feasible spatial neglect treatment : prism adaptation train dopaminergic medication . With mechanism-specific outcome assessment hierarchical linear modeling , examine whether treatment result predictable response . We also examine whether control subject-specific predictor model group recovery trajectory . Lastly , examine current standard global outcome measure instrument fully psychometrically develop , attempt predict subject- group-specific recovery profile variable . We hope research improve ability design cognitive rehabilitation treatment study . It may also , however , improve ability translate cognitive neuroscience model action , spatial knowledge , attention , treatment optimize adaptive movement complex environment . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE : This study investigate novel method outcome analysis compare two treatment hidden disability functional vision stroke . We hope research improve ability design cognitive rehabilitation treatment study . It may also , however , improve ability bring basic brain science bedside , optimize stroke survivor ' adaptive movement balance visual-spatial function complex environment . Although subject assign treatment study , classify study observational quasi-experimental option fit hierarchical design interventional study description . At point examine independent effect treatment ; rather , assign subject treatment order learn treatment exerts additional effect IN COMBINATION WITH 1 ) individual difference 2 ) performance characterization spatial bias type immediately stroke . We lastly make separate examination predictive effect brain lesion location combination variables 1 ) 2 ) . NO traditional efficacy comparison two treatment subject assign , make . Neither treatment consider `` control '' `` placebo , '' attempt match severity relevant variable two treatment assignment .</detailed_description>
