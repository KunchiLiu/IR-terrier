	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Effects Colesevelam Insulin Sensitivity ß-Cell Function Subjects With Impaired Fasting Glucose ( Prediabetes )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colesevelam bile acid sequestrant initially approve treatment patient dyslipidemia . Subsequently observed patient type 2 diabetes receive medication improve glucose control . However , mechanism ( ) lower glucose concentration determine . Glucose metabolism enhance follow oral nutrient ingestion action incretin hormone . The two major incretin hormone peptide glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP ) , release intestinal tract wall response meal . Of two peptide , GLP-1 appear important regulate glucose metabolism . In presence elevate plasma glucose , GLP-1 promote insulin release ß-cells pancreas . GLP-1 also suppress glucagon release , thereby inhibit hepatic glucose output . Administration GLP-1 infusion subcutaneous injection show improve glucose tolerance type 2 diabetic patient . The purpose study therefore determine cohort individual prediabetes , elevate fast plasma glucose increase risk develop type 2 diabetes , whether glucose lower property colesevelam occur improve insulin sensitivity , islet ß-cell function . Further , assess effect colesevelam incretin hormone release , possible determine whether improvement islet ß-cell function due enhance incretin stimulation .</detailed_description>
