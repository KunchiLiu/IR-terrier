	<brief_summary>The purpose study determinate effect pre-treatment combine serotonin ( 5-HT ) norepinephrine ( NE ) transport blocker duloxetine pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , `` Ecstasy '' ) . The investigator hypothesize duloxetine attenuate subjective cardiovascular response MDMA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interaction Between Duloxetine 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , Ecstasy )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , `` ecstasy '' ) widely use young people euphoric effect . MDMA release serotonin ( 5-HT ) , norepinephrine ( NE ) , dopamine interaction correspond presynaptic monoamine uptake transporter . 5-HT transport inhibitor block MDMA-induced 5-HT release vitro animal also attenuate subjective cardiovascular response MDMA human . NE transport inhibitor similarly prevent MDMA-induced release NE cell assay attenuate behavioral effect MDMA animal . Effects NE transporter inhibitor reboxetine response MDMA humans currently investigate . Here suggest evaluate effect pretreatment combine 5-HT NE transport blocker duloxetine pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics MDMA . The study use randomize double-blind cross-over design four experimental session . Duloxetine ( 120 mg ) placebo administer 16 h 4 h administration MDMA ( 125 mg ) placebo 16 healthy volunteer . Subjective cardiovascular response plasma sample pharmacokinetics repeatedly assess throughout experiment .</detailed_description>
