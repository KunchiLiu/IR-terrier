	<brief_summary>This investigator-masked , randomize , parallel , clinical study compare efficacy daily versus twice daily application Ultravate® ointment ( halobetasol propionate 0.05 % ointment ) combination Lac-Hydrin lotion ( ammonium lactate topical ) treatment stable plaque psoriasis . 1 ) Phase 1 : Patients treat two week combination therapy use Ultravate® ointment Lac-Hydrin lotion psoriasis plaque evaluate test efficacy medication . Half subject randomize receive treatment day Ultravate® ointment twice daily Lac-Hydrin lotion ; half subject receive twice daily Ultravate® ointment twice daily Lac-Hydrin lotion . Ultravate® ointment discontinue follow two week treatment , compliance FDA indication . Phase 2 : The second treatment phase consist four-week observation period . Subjects re-randomized either continue use twice daily Lac-Hydrin lotion , versus treatment . The purpose second phase study investigate whether use Lac-Hydrin monotherapy twice daily minimize risk recurrence maximize duration therapeutic effect . Part clinical study consist use patient physician satisfaction questionnaire . These questionnaire include question satisfaction formulation agent , question compliance treatment , etc . Such question could use demonstrate patient physician satisfaction agent , combination therapy , compare patient satisfaction rate among randomized daily versus twice daily application Ultravate® ointment .

	<criteria>Clinically diagnose investigator stable plaque psoriasis 10 % body surface area involvement . A subject must overall baseline score 6 ( moderate ) great base twelvepoint scale Psoriasis Severity Assessment ( PSA ) form . Elevation , erythema , scale grade four point scale maximum total 12 point . Each 3 variable score least two . ( Plaque elevation define total elevation , include adherent scale , relative surround skin ) . For female patient childbearing potential , regular menstrual cycle prior study entry ( female consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal , without uterus and/or ovary , bilateral tubal ligation ) . Negative urine pregnancy test time study entry ( female patient childbearing potential ) . Written , informed consent photographic release . Ability follow study instruction likely complete require visit . A female subject pregnant , nurse infant planning pregnancy study ( throughout course study , woman childbearing potential must use reliable form contraception [ i.e. , abstinence , spermicide , condom , reliable form contraception oral contraceptive ] . A subject uncontrolled systemic disease . A potential subject therapy systemic disease yet stabilize consider entry study . A subject presence skin disease might interfere diagnosis evaluation test medication . A subject condition situation investigator 's opinion may put patient significant risk , may confound study result , may interfere significantly patient 's participation study . A subject spontaneously improve rapidly deteriorate plaque psoriasis . A subject pustular erythrodermic psoriasis . A subject diagnose investigator stable plaque psoriasis involvement exceed 10 % subject 's body surface area . Use systemic agent oral retinoids , methotrexate , cyclosporine systemic corticosteroid within four week prior study entry . Use biologic agent alefacept , infliximab , efalizumab , adalimumab , etanercept within four week prior study entry . Use topical drug might alter course psoriasis ( e.g. , corticosteroid , retinoids , vitamin D analogue , salicylic acid , tacrolimus , tar anthralin , ) receive Ultraviolet B treatment within two week prior study entry . Use phototherapy psoralen ultraviolet A treatment within four week prior study entry . A subject know sensitivity study treatment and/or component . A subject require excessive prolonged exposure ultraviolet light ( e.g. , sunlight , tan bed ) study . A subject anticipate need use topical systemic therapy might alter course psoriasis . A subject anticipate need surgery hospitalization study . Concurrent involvement clinical study investigational drug device , participation clinical study within 30 day prior enter study .</criteria>
