	<detailed_description>Statins prove reduce cardiovascular event mortality large clinical trial remain underutilized partly due associate myopathy . Severe reaction manifest rhabdomyolysis rare myalgia commonly note clinical practice . The pathophysiology event remain obscure . Previous study suggest statin block downstream product ( cellular signal molecule ) mevalonate pathway need normal muscle function . Other study show statin associate gene expression involve muscle damage atrogin-1 . We quantify entity pre post statin therapy well understand reaction .</detailed_description>
