	<brief_summary>The purpose study find many irradiated natural killer ( NK ) cell safely give patient cancer recur autologous stem cell transplant , see effect ( good bad ) patient cancer . This research do currently , cure effective treatment blood-borne cancer come back autologous stem cell transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Looking Use Natural Killer Cell Line Against Hematological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients hematological malignancy acute leukemia , lymphoma , Hodgkin 's disease myeloma , generally treat initially chemotherapy , radiotherapy combination . High dose therapy autotransplantation often utilized management patient , either part initial therapy treatment relapse disease . When patient 's cancer relapse transplantation , prognosis dismal . Therapeutic option usually limit palliative chemotherapy and/or local radiation , person excellent performance status experimental treatment consider ad hoc basis . Much interest last decade focus role cellular immunotherapy setting . Cancer vaccines administration adoptive cellular immunotherapy theoretical advantage non cross-reactive previous treatment ( radiotherapy chemotherapy ) currently investigation use variety methodology . NK cell comprise roughly 15 % lymphocytes peripheral blood . They normally function part innate immune system , provide body 's initial response infection malignancy . However , patient malignancy frequently impair NK cell function , evidence reduce vitro proliferative response reduce cytotoxic activity . The infusion irradiate NK cell line appeal source cell expand therapeutic quantity , retain anti-tumor activity .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Hodgkin Disease</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Hematological malignancy ( prior histological confirmation ) relapse autologous stem cell transplant know curative standard therapy . Specific hematological malignancy include acute myeloid leukemia , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , nonHodgkin 's lymphoma , Hodgkin 's disease multiple myeloma . Assessable disease measure clinical , radiological bone marrow examination ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 Age ≥ 18 year Life expectancy great 12 week All patient must inform investigational nature study must sign give write informed consent accordance institutional University Human Experimentation Committee requirement . Adequate bone marrow , liver renal function assess follow laboratory requirement : Absolute granulocytes ≥ 0.5 x 109/L , Platelets ≥ 50 x 109/L , Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal , Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal , AST/ALT ≤ 3 x upper limit normal , Calcium &lt; 1.25 x upper limit normal . These test must conduct within 7 day prior registration . Must able come Princess Margaret Hospital , Toronto , Canada treatment followup . Pregnant nursing woman may participate . Men woman reproductive potential may participate unless agree practice effective method birth control . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test perform within 7 day prior registration . Concurrent treatment , treatment within 28 day registration experimental drug anticancer therapy . Exceptions : Patients receive receive radiation therapy less four week prior study entry exclude providing volume bone marrow treat less 10 % patient measurable disease outside radiation field . Hydroxyurea may administer patient high white cell count must discontinue least 48 hour prior NK92 cell infusion Patients CNS involvement Known HIV , HBV HCV infection Serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol , include active uncontrolled infection , major cardiovascular event within 3 month registration , psychiatric emotional disorder . Patients hypersensitivity previous severe reaction Allopurinol , Acetominophen Benadryl available alternative medication .</criteria>
