	<brief_summary>Alcohol well-established consequence lung include increase risk upper respiratory tract infection , pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . There even report alcohol-induced asthma . Data investigator ' laboratory establish airway specifically impact alcohol exposure . Because airways heavily expose vapor phase alcohol drink airway motor tone modulate cAMP , investigator speculate airway bronchial motor function would alter mouse feed alcohol . The investigator ' preliminary study demonstrate brief alcohol administration significantly attenuate airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) mouse model . This novel finding lead u hypothesize : Alcohol exposure modify airway hyperresponsiveness cAMP/NO- dependent mechanism .</brief_summary>
