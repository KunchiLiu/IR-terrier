	<brief_summary>This pilot study assess feasibility use heavy water safe 'tracer ' biomarker study diseases brain spinal cord , , together , also call central nervous system ( CNS ) . Heavy water , also call deuterated water D20 , normal drinking water except hydrogen atom replace deuterium , naturally occur isotope hydrogen . In particular , study use heavy water define : 1 ) The rate immune cell proliferation ( growth ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) compare blood . This study examine particular type immune cell call T lymphocytes . 2 ) This study also examine select molecule generate nerve cell CNS understand rate secretion turnover healthy control participant , HIV-1-infected participant participant non-HIV-related neurodegenerative disease Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . This study involve administration heavy water orally either seven day , 12 day six week . Measurements take lumbar puncture ( LP , also know spinal tap ) . Blood ( approximately five tablespoon per visit ) also obtain lumbar puncture appointment . If method use establish rate immune cell turnover production rate neuronal molecule use cerebrospinal fluid , provide unique data important understand chronic neurodegenerative condition , like PD , measure response target therapy . Hypothesis : 1 . D2O , administer orally , use measure proliferation rate CSF T cell ( , eventually , major phenotypic subset ) . 2 . D2O use assess turnover production rate CNS constituent normally pathologically shed secrete CSF , include ( eventually ) : cargo molecule transport specifically neuron CNS , chromogranin-A -B , neuregulin-1 ( specifically extracellular secrete ectodomain neuronal differentiation factor ( NDF ) isoform type α1 , α2 , β1 , acetylcholine receptor induce activity isoform ( ARIA ) , secrete amyloid precursor protein ( sAPP ) , alpha-synuclein ; APP metabolites amyloid beta ( Aβ ) 41 42 .</brief_summary>
