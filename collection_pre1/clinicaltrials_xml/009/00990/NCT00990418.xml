	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Between Integrated E-TRANS ( Fentanyl ) System Separated ( Two-Part ) E-TRANS ( Fentanyl ) System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study establish bioequivalence Integrated E-TRANS ( fentanyl HCl ) System Separated ( Two-Part ) E-TRANS ( fentanyl HCl ) System . The target indication short-term management acute postoperative pain adult patient require opioid analgesia hospitalization . This single-center , open-label ( people involve know identity intervention ) , randomize , 2-period , 2-treatment , 2-sequence , crossover ( participant receive different intervention sequentially study ) intervention study . Each volunteer randomly assign sequence . There washout period 6 14 day treatment . Volunteers remain study site fentanyl treatment 34 hour follow completion treatment . Approximately 60 healthy volunteer enrol ensure 40 volunteer complete pharmacokinetic evaluation treatment . Each volunteer receive Treatment A Treatment B ( either Treatment A follow Treatment B Treatment B follow Treatment A . ) Treatment A 80 consecutive dos Ontegrated E-TRANS ( fentanylHCL ) 40mcg System , deliver 10 minute total delivery time 13.33 hour . Treatment B 80 consecutive dos Separated ( Two-Part ) E-TRANS ( fentanyl HCL ) 40 mcg System , deliver 10 minute , total deliver time 13.33 hour . Blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis ( analysis amount drug blood specific time point ) collect volunteer fentanyl treatment 34 hour termination treatment . The skin site E-TRANS ( fentanyl HCl ) System apply monitor development topical ( skin irritation ) adverse event 1 24 hour removal system ( ) . Safety evaluation perform include adverse event monitoring , laboratory assessment , alcohol testing , serum pregnancy test woman child-bearing potential , urine drug screening , physical examination , electrocardiogram , continuous pulse oximetry monitor oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , temperature . The study continue approximately 3 week , include washout period 6 14 day treatment , exclude screening period . Treatment A : Integrated E-TRANS ( fentanyl HCl ) 40 mcg System 80 consecutive dos , deliver 10 minute 13.33 hour Treatment B : Separated ( Two-Part ) E-TRANS ( fentanyl HCl ) 40 mcg System 80 consecutive dos , deliver 10 minute 13.33 hour . Volunteers randomly assign either receive either Treatment A follow Treatment B Treatment B follow Treatment A .</detailed_description>
