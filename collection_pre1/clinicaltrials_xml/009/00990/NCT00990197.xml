	<brief_summary>Continuing smoke heart attack greatly increase risk death cardiac illness . The nicotine patch commonly use pharmacotherapy smoking cessation great potential help heart attack patient quit smoke . However , due safety concern , physician often hesitant prescribe nicotine patch patient suffer heart attack . The STADIA pilot study assess feasibility large-scale clinical trial investigate safety efficacy outcomes associate nicotine patch immediately follow heart attack . Eligible subject randomize within 48 hour suffer heart attack wear transdermal nicotine patch either day 1 day 2 study period . The nicotine patch deliver nicotine patient period 24 hour . Patients advise discuss smoke cessation strategy treat physician subsequent care leave discretion physician . The duration ischemia ( loss blood flow heart ) , patient adherence , incidence arrhythmia ( disorder heart rate rhythm ) , heart rate , blood pressure within two group use evaluate safety transdermal nicotine use immediately heart attack .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety Transdermal Nicotine Immediately Following Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective The STADIA Pilot Study use evaluate feasibility conduct three-year multi-centre trial investigate long-term safety efficacy outcomes associate transdermal nicotine use immediately follow acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Rationale Patients initially survive ACS high risk recurrent cardiac event cardiovascular death . Within first 6 month alone , 12 % patient die suffer another ACS , another 23 % require revascularization angina . Patients able quit smoking reduce chance suffer recurrent ACS cardiovascular death within next year ≥ 50 % . After survive ACS , patient highly motivate stop smoking . However , nicotine extremely addictive psychoactive drug , 60 % patient attempt quit relapse . Hospitalization follow ACS provide opportunity smoker quit , smoke hospital prohibit . However , abstinence hospitalize also precipitate intense nicotine withdrawal symptom , largely responsible high rate smoke relapse . Nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) ameliorate many symptom increase chance smoker continue abstain tobacco use discharge . Of available NRTs , transdermal nicotine associate least severe cardiovascular effect , delivers nicotine gradually ( low peak value ) nicotine gum inhaler . Although transdermal nicotine double long-term smoking cessation rate compare placebo , rarely prescribed physician week immediately follow ACS possible cardiovascular effect nicotine ACS yet systematically evaluate . Methods A total 30 patient randomize within 48-hours suffering ACS Jewish General Hospital ( Montreal , QC ) collaborate centre . Prior randomization , patient receive standardize smoking cessation counselling . Subjects satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion trial randomize within 48 hour suffer ACS wear transdermal nicotine patch either day 1 day 2 study period . Subjects apply patch morning treatment day keep 24 hour . Patients advise discuss smoke cessation strategy treat physician subsequent care leave discretion physician . Twenty-four hour Holter monitoring use measure heart rate , incidence arrhythmia , duration ischemic event day 1 day 2 study period . Systolic diastolic blood pressure assess via 24-hour Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) . ABPM use day 1 day 2 study period . On day 1 study nurse record severity nicotine withdrawal symptom , side effect , smoke relapse , many cigarette smoke , medication currently take . On day 7 14 patient contact telephone determine severity nicotine withdrawal symptom , smoke relapse , many cigarette smoke medication currently take . Cardiovascular event assess patient monitoring study nurse . Nicotine withdrawal symptom accord Hughes-Hatsukami symptom scale common nicotine patch side effect , severity-rated five-point scale , determine study nurse inquiry day 1 , 7 , 14 ( 6 ) . Carbon monoxide monitor use measure level expire CO baseline . Participants whose level expire CO exceed 10 ppm classify smoker . Significance If show safe effective , transdermal nicotine major impact secondary prevention recurrent cardiac event 20,000 Canadian smoker suffer ACS year .</detailed_description>
