The goal project prospective evaluation frequency GI pathology transplant candidate specific focus follow question : 1 . Are GI-pathologies occur high prevalence transplant candidate describe general population increase GI-pathologies since introduction urgency-based organ allocation lead sicker transplant candidate ? 2 . What influence endoscopic finding patient management transplantation ? 3 . Which risk factor identify predict presence GI-lesions ? 4 . Is subgroup patient , screen colonoscopy liver transplantation recommend consider cost/benefit ratio ? 5 . Is correlation endoscopic finding outcome liver transplantation gastrointestinal complication transplantation ( e.g . gastrointestinal bleeding , perforation gastrointestinal malignancy ) ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The introduction MELD ( model end-stage liver disease ) base necessity-oriented allocation system liver transplantation ( OLT ) lead increase number patient advance liver disease wait list . Hence essential optimize outcome transplantation high-risk patient collective order best utilize limit supply donor organ . To achieve goal , careful selection appropriate transplantation candidate base extensive evaluation patient include cardiac , pulmonary renal test different image method exclude malignancy infective focus . As many institution also Medical School Hannover ( MHH ) esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) colonoscopy standard procedure evaluation liver transplantation . The rationale perform procedure identify patient medical condition might limit outcome OLT . Some endoscopic finding example esophageal varix , gastric duodenal ulcer colon adenoma treat transplantation , patient enters wait list well medical condition . If gastrointestinal malignancy detect , patient longer consider candidate OLT , unless curative treat . The detection premalignant change ( high grade adenoma , barrett 's esophagus etc . ) great importance , since immunosuppressed liver transplantation recipients probably high risk progress malignancy . So far data regard prevalence upper low gastrointestinal pathology transplantation candidate contradictory base retrospective study . These study often include subgroup transplantation candidate . Many centre perform screen colonoscopy OLT evaluation patient great age 45 50 , although today clear evidence , young patient benefit screen colonoscopy . So far know certain preoperative endoscopic finding correlate postoperative gastrointestinal complication . Such correlation , e.g . diverticulosis postoperative colon perforation peritonitis due diverticulitis , could highly relevant patient management OLT . Methods : After sign informed consent result EGD colonoscopy patient evaluate OLT MHH together laboratory clinical data enter database . After follow least one year data analyze . Descriptive statistic well multivariate analysis perform , find frequency endoscopic diagnose transplantation candidate look correlation finding patient outcome OLT .</detailed_description>
