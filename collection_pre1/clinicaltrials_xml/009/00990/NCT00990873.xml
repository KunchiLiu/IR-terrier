	<brief_title>Study Tissue Samples From Patients With Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Enrolled Research Study CALGB-140202</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine whether 64-gene signature accurately predict prognosis survival patient stage I non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . OUTLINE : RNA purify tissue sample obtain CALGB Lung Cancer Study ( CALGB-140202 ) . The RNA sample use gene expression analysis use 64-gene signature Affymetrix-HG_U133A array . Reverse-transcriptase PCR may also perform select sample .</detailed_description>
