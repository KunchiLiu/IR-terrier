	<brief_summary>Insulin normally bioavailable take oral route , degradation molecule may occur ventricle intestine . Oral administration uptake less intestine would offer major advantage make possible . It would offer simple non-injection method administer insulin connection meal absorb insulin would enter blood stream mimic natural distribution body first pas liver . The sponsor study develop novel oral insulin formulation base proprietary dextran matrix . The investigational drug capsule contain 100 IU human insulin dextran matrix . The primary objective study establish safety , tolerance PD profile ( i.e . pharmacodynamic parameter glucose insulin ) peroral insulin dextran matrix patient type 2 diabetes . The phase I/II study protocol consist two part ; part 1 ( dose find ) part 2 ( dose verification ) . In study part 1 single escalate dos oral insulin placebo give test subject . Capillary blood glucose use assess insulin effect . Subsequently , study part 2 , investigational drug administer 3 time daily 6 consecutive day . The start dose part 2 low effective dose find study part 1 . Dose escalation do increment 100 IU . The total number subject 32 ( part 1 2 combine ) .</brief_summary>
