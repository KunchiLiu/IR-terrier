	<brief_summary>Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bortezomib surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving bortezomib together temozolomide surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . This phase II trial study well give bortezomib surgery follow give bortezomib together temozolomide surgery work treat patient recurrent malignant glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Presurgery Bortezomib Recurrent Malignant Gliomas Followed Postop Bortezomib &amp; Temozolomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 . Patients undergo surgical resection tumor day 8 9 . Beginning approximately 14 day surgery , patient receive oral temozolomide day 1-7 14-21 bortezomib IV day 7 21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tumor tissue blood sample collect periodically biomarker analysis , gene methylation study , pharmacokinetic study . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
