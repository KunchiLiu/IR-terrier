	<brief_title>Evaluating Effects Two Diets Combined With Exercise Persons With Abdominal Obesity ( The SHAPE5 Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abdominal obesity condition largely influenced poor diet physical inactivity . This condition adverse effect heart blood vessel structure function , include leave ventricular diastolic dysfunction , endothelial vasodilator dysfunction , increase vascular stiffness , increase risk cardiovascular disease . Reducing amount calorie consume increase physical activity important factor lose weight , increase fitness , improve blood glucose control . However , little research conduct compare different diet approach combine exercise effect general abdominal obesity , fitness , heart blood vessel structure function , heart disease risk factor . The purpose study determine whether people follow low-carbohydrate diet low-fat , low-calorie diet , combine supervise experience similar improvement cardiovascular body composition health . This study enroll people overweight obese abdominal obesity , define waist hip ratio great 1 , waist size 40 '' great men 35 '' great woman . Participants attend baseline study visit complete blood pressure measurement ; muscle strength measurement ; treadmill test evaluate cardiovascular fitness ; echocardiogram obtain image heart ; test measure blood vessel function ; dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan measure body fat , muscle tissue , bone density ; questionnaires assess physical activity level , quality life , mood ; blood collection . A portion blood store future genetic testing . Women also provide urine sample pregnancy test . Participants also keep food diary 3 day . Participants randomly assign either low-carbohydrate low-fat , low-calorie weight loss diet , combine supervised exercise program . . The exercise program do three time week 6 month . Each session last 1 1 Â½ hour include aerobic exercise weight training . All participant attend study visit dietitian weight loss counsel monitor week Months 1 2 , every week Months 3 6 . At visit , participant ' weight measure . At end Month 6 , participant attend study visit repeat baseline test . In addition , another test vascular function , BP , weight , waist hip measurement time participant loses ten pound .</detailed_description>
