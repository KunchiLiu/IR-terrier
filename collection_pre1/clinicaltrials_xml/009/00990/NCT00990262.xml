	<brief_summary>The goal research determine noninvasively whether detection coronary stenosis plaque multidetector compute tomography ( MDCT ) patient acute chest pain suspect acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) enhance triage , reduce cost cost effective . Among 5.6 million patient ACP present annually emergency department ( ED ) United States , subgroup two million patient hospitalized despite normal initial cardiac biomarker test electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . This subgroup low ( 20 % ) risk ACS index hospitalization . Most ( 80-94 % ) patient diagnosis ACS significant epicardial coronary artery stenosis ( &gt; 50 % luminal narrowing ) . However , -10 % patient non-stenotic coronary plaque trigger event , i.e . vasospasms , lead myocardial ischemia . Since absence plaque exclude coronary cause chest pain , patient could theory discharge earlier reduce unnecessary hospital admission . Recent publication demonstrate high sensitivity specificity MDCT detection significant coronary stenosis compare coronary angiography detection coronary plaque validate intravascular ultrasound . Using 64- slice MDCT propose study 400 patient ACP , negative initial cardiac biomarkers non-diagnostic ECG . We analyze MDCT image presence significant coronary artery stenosis plaque correlate data clinical diagnosis ACS ( AHA guideline ) index hospitalization determine sensitivity specificity . MDCT data , risk factor , result standard diagnostic test available time MDCT use generate multivariate prediction function derive clinical decision rule . Based decision rule compare diagnostic accuracy cost effectiveness compete strategy . We hypothesize MDCT- base diagnostic strategy reduce time diagnosis ACS , number hospitalization , absolute cost management patient acute chest pain compare standard clinical care cost effective .</brief_summary>
