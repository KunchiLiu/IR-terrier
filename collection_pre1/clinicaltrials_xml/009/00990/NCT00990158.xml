	<brief_summary>Warfarin highly effective prevention first recurrent thrombotic event , however even minor excursion outside reference INR range 2.0 3.0 associate bleeding thrombotic complication . The importance maintain INR within desire interval lead concept `` time therapeutic range ( TTR ) '' - total proportion time INR 2.0 3.0 . The investigator propose multicentre , double blind , randomize trial determine 0.150 mg oral vitamin K increase time therapeutic range patient receive warfarin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Low Dose Oral Vitamin K Improve International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Stability ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>What is/are principal research objective ( ) question ( ) address ? Research Objectives : Our broad objective improve quality anticoagulant care patient receive warfarin . Our specific objective determine improve TTR LDVK , non-toxic , inexpensive easily administer medication . Hypothesis : We hypothesize patient receive vitamin K high TTR receive placebo . In mechanistic study propose VKORC1 CYP2C9 genotype modulate impact vitamin K INR control . Research question : Efficacy ( primary ) : When compare placebo addition 150 microgram daily vitamin K `` usual warfarin therapy '' improve anticoagulant control measure `` time therapeutic range '' ? Safety ( Secondary ) : Does LDVK increase frequency adverse clinical event , include thromboembolism ? Does LDVK reduce risk major and/or bleed ? Mechanistic ( Hypothesis generate ) : Do VKORC1 CYP2C9 genotypes modulate effect vitamin K INR stability ? Study design : The propose pilot study multi-centre , placebo control , randomize trial additional pilot mechanistic study ( Figure 1 provide broad outline study ) . Study intervention : Patients receive daily dose 150 microgram vitamin K match placebo medication total 7 month - one month `` run period '' 6 month period follow-up . They continue receive warfarin supervision anticoagulant clinic - one study mandate INR within 7 day enrolment change patient care make result participation study . All patient enrol mechanistic study . Patients blood drawn time provide consent VKORC1 CYP2C9 genotype determine . Allocation patient study group : Randomization achieve use computer generate random number table . Patients stratify base clinical centre . Practically , random number table produce coordinate centre clinical centre . The study coordinate centre package six week supply drug placebo sequentially number , identical drug container base randomization sequence site . The drug package ship centre . After consent obtain , coordinate centre notify , patient allocate treatment dispense sequential drug container numeric sequence . Additional supply ( total seven month therapy patient ) dispense anticoagulant clinic block 6 week . This method allocation ensure research subject study staff mask allocation drug placebo identical . Masked allocation protect provide unblinding schedule centre foresee circumstance immediate unblinding would require . Frequency duration trial follow-up : Patients INR check minimum 1 week initiation study drug follow per anticoagulant clinic routine . We mandate particular frequency INR test change clinic routine induce unwanted change INR control co-intervention could influence TTR attributable study intervention . Clinical event review , per current clinic routine , INR check . If clinical event report source documentation seek purpose adjudication . Our research group extensive prior experience collection interpretation INR value , ascertainment , collection report clinical event anticoagulated patient . Primary secondary outcome measure : The primary outcome simple comparison mean TTRs LDVK placebo patient . As noted , calculation TTR begin first INR obtain minimum 4 week randomization end 7 month enrolment . The TTR calculate use previously validate computer algorithm , base method Rosendaal et al ( 7 ) . Secondary outcome measure include ( ) significant INR excursion ( INR &lt; 1.5 &gt; 4.5 ) , ( b ) number INR determination ( c ) bleed thrombotic event sufficient severity require medical intervention - possible source document hospital admission obtain allow characterization event . Major bleeding define bleed consistent 8th ACCP guideline ( 36 ) . All bleed thrombotic event independently adjudicate panel expert base submit source documentation . Plan ascertain outcome measure follow-up : INR value obtain routinely part warfarin care . All INR determination perform clinical laboratory participate provincially mandate external quality assessment exercise ensure quality . INR value current warfarin dose report coordinate centre use online data entry reporting system . Clinical event measure per `` Primary secondary outcome measure '' section . Will health service research issue address within trial ? As pilot study feel valid health service research question pose context study . We propose simple cost effectiveness analysis examine estimate total cost participation study - analysis compare number type medical intervention ( cost ) two arm study . Costs determine validated Ontario cost data INR test , clinical visit monitoring cost well estimate cost attributable clinic event , occur . Funding analysis seek different source , however ensure data require complete analysis collect within context study . Trial sample size justification assumption underlie power calculation : As pilot study novel intervention estimate improvement TTR expect see LDVK . As proposed sample size 400 patient ( 200 per arm ) one convenience however study power detect probable change TTR . Thus , 85 % likelihood detect 15 % increase TTR assume TTR 55 % placebo arm ( two side alpha = 0.05 , comparison proportion , Fleiss correction ) ( 37 ) . A table conditional power present Table 2 . In subsequent study ( justify , base result study ) power base rate clinical event . One prior paper examine increase TTR vitamin K administration ; increase TTR study 28 % , thus reassure ability reliably detect 15 % difference TTR ( 17 ) .</detailed_description>
