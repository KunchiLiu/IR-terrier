	<brief_summary>Background : Alcohol one principal cause hepatic fibrosis . Although effective treatment alcoholic hepatic fibrosis abstinence alcohol consumption , additive treatment reduce accumulation scar tissue accelerate improvement hepatic fibrosis alcoholic liver disease . The renin-angiotensin system attractive antifibrotic target liver . Several line evidence indicate overproduction angiotensin II ( ANG II ) chronic liver injury stimulates activation hepatic stellate cell ( HSCs ) attribute fibrogenesis . Additionally , antifibrotic effect ANG II block agent show various animal model hepatitis C patient . Hence , drug inhibit renin-angiotensin system promise ameliorate hepatic fibrosis chronic liver injury . However , study conduct patient alcoholic liver disease evaluate effect ANG II type I receptor block agent hepatic fibrosis . Aim : This study aim investigate safety efficacy chronic administration candesartan hepatic fibrosis patient alcoholic liver disease . Methods 1 ) Patients liver fibrosis ( F2 ) randomize receive either angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) , candesartan ( 8 mg/day ) ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) ( 600 mg/day ) ( n = 42 ) , UDCA alone ( n = 43 ) control 6 month . 2 ) All enrol patient underwent liver biopsy twice measurement fibrosis score , area fibrosis alpha-smooth muscle actin ( SMA ) positive hydroxyproline . 3 ) Transforming growth factor-beta1 ( TGF-beta1 ) , collagen-1 , angiotensin II type I receptor ( AT1-R ) , tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 ( TIMP-1 ) , Rac1 p22phox represent oxidant stress also measure real-time RT-PCR 6 month therapy .</brief_summary>
