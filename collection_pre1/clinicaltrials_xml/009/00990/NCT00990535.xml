	<brief_summary>Octreotide ( OCT ) somatostatin analogue ( SSA ) available long-acting formulation , conventionally administer every 28 day maximum dose 30 mg . Together lanreotide , consider therapy choice control endocrine syndromes associate neuroendocrine tumor ( NET ) s. A complete partial clinical response SSA therapy generally achieve least 50 % patient neuroendocrine syndrome . Many study report clinical response 70-90 % function NETs . In 36-50 % patient progressive advanced well differentiate NET ( WDNET ) , stabilization disease occur treatment subcutaneous OCT. By develop long-acting slow-release SSA formulation , long-acting OCT ( LAR ) , lanreotide-SR , lanreotide-Autogel , patient 's compliance SSA therapy improve escape treatment , common subcutaneous formulation , avoid . However , rate objective response significantly improve compare short-acting SSA . On hand , remark long-acting SSA use NET patient dose correspondent low dos short-acting formulation . The high commercially available dos LAR 30 mg , assume comparable 300 Âµg short-acting OCT therapy acromegaly . Only one study design investigate use high-dose LAR ( 160 mg every 28 day ) . In study , objective hormonal response patient progressive metastatic ileal NET non-responder standard dos , significantly elevate . However , compound never commercialize , consequence , first preliminary observation confirm study . No systematic study perform commercially available long-acting SSA use high-dose treatment . In patient progressive locally advanced metastatic NET , increase dose reduction interval injection relatively common `` empirical '' clinical practice , study perform evaluate safety efficacy treatment schedule .</brief_summary>
