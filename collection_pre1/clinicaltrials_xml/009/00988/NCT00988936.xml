	<brief_summary>A Pilot Phase II Study The primary objective study : - To explore usefulness [ F-18 ] RGD-K5 PET/CT predict efficacy early response Avastin® ( anti-angiogenesis drug ) plus chemotherapy treatment full course treatment complete The secondary objective study : - To continue safety evaluation collection safety data patient - To gain experience [ F-18 ] RGD-K5 PET/CT order improve study design conduct future study Design : An open label , non-randomized , uncontrolled , single group assignment , pilot efficacy study Duration : Screening visit ( 3-4 hr ) , pre-treatment image visit [ F-18 ] RGD-K5 PET/CT ( ~ 3-4 hr ) standard [ F-18 ] FDG PET/CT ( ~ 3-4 hr ) diagnostic CT , follow two [ F-18 ] RGD-K5 PET/CT scan , one second third Avastin® treatment , one fourth fifth Avastin® treatment , follow standard [ F-18 ] FDG PET ( ~ 3-4 hr ) diagnostic CT . Procedures : Informed consent , collection demographic information , medical history , blood lab , physical examination , vital sign , ECGs , three set [ F-18 ] RGD-K5 dose image scan include pretreatment , early mid-treatment , later mid-treatment , concomitant medication collection , adverse event monitoring , assessment tumor response treatment Patients : Approximately forty ( 40 ) patient non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer , metastatic breast cancer , metastatic colon rectum cancer receive chemotherapy plus Avastin® . This allow approximately 30 evaluable patient complete study approximately four eight site internationally</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim pilot study examine utility new molecular imaging tracer , [ F-18 ] RGD-K5 monitor treatment responses patient schedule undergo treatment Avastin® ( Bevacizumab ) plus standard chemotherapy . The change [ F-18 ] RGD-K5 PET/CT image scan treatment mid-treatment cycle Avastin® ( Bevacizumab ) evaluate . The hypothesis study change uptake [ F-18 ] RGD-K5 PET tumor may reflect change level integrin expression and/or angiogenesis . This pilot study help define change uptake [ F-18 ] RGD-K5 early indicator treatment efficacy Avastin® .</detailed_description>
