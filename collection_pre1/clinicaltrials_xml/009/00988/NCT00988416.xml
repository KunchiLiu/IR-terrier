	<brief_title>Positron Emission Tomography-computed Tomography ( PET-CT ) Main &amp; Branch Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Duct involve intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm associate 35-70 % ( particularly involve main duct ) incidence malignancy . Current guideline recommend pancreatic resection fit patient main branch duct involve IPMN . Pancreatic resection associate morbidity mortality . Reliable test biomarkers accurately differentiate non-malignant malignant duct involve IPMN non-existent . Test biomarkers differentiate duct involve duct uninvolved IPMN also inaccurate . Patients suspect duct IPMN symptoms high chance associate malignancy . These finding specific malignant IPMN , rely , would result miss malignancy well potentially unnecessary operation significant percentage patient . PET scan study retrospectively purport highly reliable indicator og high grade dysplasia and/or invasive cancer patient IPMN . Thus , PET could represent future standard care authority work-up patient IPMN . This proposal seek prove hypothesis pancreas PET-CT differentiate duct involve IPMN malignancy duct involve IPMN without malignancy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible study clinical and/or cytopathologic diagnosis IPMN ( primary recurrent ) suspect main branch duct involvement . A clinical diagnosis IPMN main duct involvement determine surgeon care patient . Main duct involvement may suspect significant radiographic character change ( cystic dilation ) main pancreatic duct ( independent ductal diameter ) , significant `` stepup '' main duct diameter ( 23 fold ) significant segmental diffuse dilation main pancreatic duct ( &gt; equal 4mm ) define CT , MRCP , EUS ERCP . All patient diagnosis ( pathologic ) presume diagnosis ( base upon clinical presentation ) IPMN undergo surgical treatment eligible study . This may include patient already undergone IPMN surgery past expect undergo second IPMN surgery . Patients unrecoverable renal function dialysis eligible undergo study . Female patient childbearing age must negative urine serum pregnancy test prior enrollment . Subjects must medical insurance Medicare willing pay cost PETCT procedure CT portion procedure . Patients despite suspected duct involve IPMN fit surgical candidate thus undergo resection IPMN . Patients uncontrolled serum glucose eligible study due unreliability PET patient . Diabetic patient eligible long glucose reasonably control ( determined nuclear medicine radiologist ) . The Department Radiology Standard Operating Procedure place management patient follow protocol . Pediatric patient exclude study since IPMN diagnosis present adult patient . Female patient pregnant currently breastfeed . Patients allergy IV contrast relative contraindication study . Some patient discretion investigator may undergo standard protocol preIV contrast steroid manage allergic response . The Department Radiology guideline follow protocol patient experience allergic reaction IV contrast . Patients renal insufficiency ( creatinine &gt; equal 2.0 ) relative contraindication study . At investigator 's discretion patient may enrol undergo PETCT without IV contrast . Patients without insurance Medicare coverage patient insurance/Medicare coverage insurer unwilling pay cost PETCT procedure CT portion procedure .</criteria>
