	<brief_title>Shaolin Dan Tian Breathing Fosters Relaxed Attentive Mind</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuroelectrophysiological study various type meditative breathing reveal association either relax ( i.e. , enhance alpha asymmetry ) attentive state ( i.e. , enhance intra- inter-hemispheric theta coherence ) . The present study aim utilize well-known neuroelectrophysiological technique investigate relatively less studied Shaolin Dan Tian Breathing ( DTB ) technique . This technique consist two component -- Passive DTB Active DTB , consider relaxation exercise also form Qigong . Based upon pilot neuroimaging data clinical observation , hypothesize familiarize method , practice DTB induce relax attentive state . Twenty-two adult receive train DTB ( experimental group ) one month . They instruct practice technique daily , practice , felt warm and/or relaxed . Twenty age- , gender- education-matched adult receive conventional progressive muscle relaxation training recruit control . All participation voluntary . Quantitative EEG bio-physiological data collect baseline post training . Eyes-closed rest EEG data immediately type breathe obtain individually two time point .</detailed_description>
