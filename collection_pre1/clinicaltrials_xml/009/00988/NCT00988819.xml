	<brief_title>To Investigate Influence Ethnicity Metabolic Disease Healthy , Overweight Obese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over past decade , investigator Singapore actively study impact ethnicity metabolic trait , particularly related insulin resistance ( detailed preliminary data proposal . We observe , BMI , Asian Indians appear great insulin resistance Chinese . In line great insulin resistance observe Asian Indians , also note Asian Indians exhibit great central obesity ( manifest large waist circumference ) . In way , resembles phenotype might expect mismatch pathway describe proposal , involve pathogenesis insulin resistance ethnic group . Interestingly , Asian Indians also note low birth weight Chinese population . In contrast , although Malays insulin resistant Chinese , largely due great adiposity , adjustment body mass index , Malays actually less insulin resistant Chinese Asian Indian counterpart . They also small waist circumference . It also recognize pregnant Malay woman tend generally obese Chinese Asian Indian counterpart , may put child great risk fetal hyperinsulinemia . As , potential exists latter pathway active pathogenesis insulin resistance ethnic group .</detailed_description>
