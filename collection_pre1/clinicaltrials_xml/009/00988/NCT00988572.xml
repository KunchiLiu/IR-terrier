	<brief_summary>Dizziness identify risk factor fall vestibular asymmetry find among patient fall-related wrist fracture well among patient hip-fracture . Since wrist fracture risk factor hip-fracture , much effort focus prevent fall risk-groups . Therefore , would interest find possible influence vestibular asymmetry vestibular rehabilitation . The aim study therefore find vestibular rehabilitation effect vestibular function among patient fall-related wrist fracture .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vestibular Rehabilitation Patients With Fall-related Wrist Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fall-related fracture increase problem society . Almost 30 % person 65 year age fall year . In Sweden 627 person 100 000 treated hospital injury fall . In Malm√∂ , figure 883 person 100 000 . However , fall lead fracture . Dizziness identify risk factor fall vestibular asymmetry find among patient fall-related wrist fracture well among patient hip-fracture . Vestibular rehabilitation program first develop forty , originally use peripheral vestibular disorder , order facilitate recovery . Modern research widen use vestibular rehabilitation patient cause dizziness peripheral vestibular disorder . Since wrist fracture risk factor hip-fracture , much effort focus prevent fall risk-groups . Therefore , would interest find possible influence vestibular asymmetry vestibular rehabilitation . The aim study therefore find vestibular rehabilitation effect vestibular function among patient fall-related wrist fracture .</detailed_description>
