	<brief_summary>Advanced stage lung cancer generally treat anti-cancer medication call chemotherapy . Most lung cancer cause cigarette smoking . However , lung cancer develop people never smoke smoked short period time . This type lung cancer may respond medication call erlotinib ( Tarceva ) . Erlotinib anticancer pill approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use patient advance lung cancer . Unfortunately , erlotinib work patient works period time . The doctor try find way improve effect erlotinib combine another anti-cancer medication . Ascenta Therapeutics , Inc. develop drug call AT-101 potential treatment cancer . AT-101 investigational drug . That mean AT-101 approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) general use . The FDA permit use study like one determine whether safe effective . This first study examine effect AT-101 erlotinib . It hop combine AT-101 erlotinib , AT-101 may help erlotinib work well shrink lung cancer . Studies perform laboratory suggest AT-101 combination erlotinib may effective shrink tumor erlotinib alone .</brief_summary>
