	<brief_summary>The goal research proposal understand reproductive age process woman improve ability clinically assess model reproductive aging . Reproductive age continuous process begin many year prior menopause . Women late 30 early 40 usually maintain normal menstrual function ovulatory status , yet fertility woman considerably compromise compare young woman . The primary mechanism reproductive age process ovarian primordial follicle ( egg ) depletion , process exhibit considerable variation woman . As result , age individual begin experience infertility menstrual cycle change secondary follicle depletion also vary significantly difficult predict . The clinical assessment number primordial follicle remain ovary traditionally rely upon measurement ovarian pituitary hormone FSH , estradiol , inhibin B . Unfortunately , measure indirect poorly sensitive assessment ovarian reserve . More recently , serum level anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone ( AMH ) ovarian antral follicle count utilized clinical measure ovarian reserve . Both correlated chronological age predictive power determine stimulation quantity ( number oocyte obtain time egg-recovery ) in-vitro fertilization ( IVF ) treatment cycle . Reproductive age woman ; however , depletion oocytes woman 's ovary , also involve decline oocyte quality . The predictive value clinical marker ovarian reserve regard oocyte quality unknown . Additionally , new tool develop assess biological age organ system white blood cell telomere length measurement advance glycation end product ( AGEs ) skin autofluorescence evaluate respect reproductive age process . This proposal seek develop good model normal female reproductive age identify novel marker ovarian reserve determine relationship oocyte quantity quality obtain IVF treatment cycle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To test hypothesis , enroll 120 healthy woman undergo ART cycle OU Physicians Reproductive Health . Patients undergoing ART treatment cycle OU Physicians Reproductive Health clinic approach regard enrollment . - informed consent - collection baseline demographic data ( height , weight , ethnicity , age ) - cycle-day 3 measurement FSH , estradiol , inhibin B , AMH , white-blood cell telomere length assay , measurement hemoglobin A1C control blood glucose level - AFC determine transvaginal ultrasound exam - skin autofluorescence measurement - subject undergo IVF direct physician - outcome measure include number oocyte recover , peak estradiol , quantity gonadotropin utilized course treatment , assessment oocyte quality morphology assessment light microscopy .</detailed_description>
