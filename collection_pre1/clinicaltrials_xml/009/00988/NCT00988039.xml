	<brief_summary>The trial aim ascertain , anything , need combine boost protease inhibitor ( bPI ) backbone second-line therapy order maximize chance good clinical outcome follow WHO-defined failure first-line nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) NNRTI-containing regimen probable extensive NRTI NNRTI resistance mutation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The standard care second-line HIV therapy patient fail first-line NNRTI-based regimen combine boost protease inhibitor ( bPI ) two ( new ) NRTIs . However , patient fail first-line therapy roll-out programme often extensive NRTI resistance mutation may compromise efficacy NRTI drug use second-line therapy likely virological potency second-line regimen mostly due bPI . It possible contribution NRTI drug efficacy may outweigh additional toxicity cost . It also possible replace NRTI drug new class drug ( integrase inhibitor ) improve outcome second-line therapy , although boosted protease inhibitor alone provide close optimal response , incremental gain add new class may small . The principal aim determine whether , patient fail first-line NRTI NNRTI-containing regimen : - The use bPI plus raltegravir ( integrase inhibitor ) superior standard care ( bPI plus 2 new NRTIs ) achieve good HIV disease control 96 week randomisation - The use bPI monotherapy , precede 12-week induction period combination raltegravir , non-inferior standard care achieve good HIV disease control 96 week randomisation</detailed_description>
