	<brief_summary>This global randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blinded Phase 2 study design compare treatment ARQ 197 versus placebo patient unresectable HCC radiographic disease progression systemic first line therapy unable tolerate therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial ARQ 197 Patients With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC ) Who Have Failed One Prior Systemic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomly assign 2:1 ratio receive ARQ 197 placebo . The treatment assignment stratify base Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) , vascular invasion status . The treatment ARQ 197 placebo continue progression disease , unacceptable toxicity , another discontinuation criterion list protocol meet . After radiographic disease progression document , treatment assignment unblinded . Patients assign placebo arm document radiographic disease progression option receive ARQ 197 evaluate objective response rate disease control rate continuously . The study continue 78 total time progression event reach . At end study , remain patient still treatment option roll another study continue treatment .</detailed_description>
