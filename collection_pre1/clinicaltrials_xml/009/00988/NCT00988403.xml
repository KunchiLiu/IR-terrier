	<brief_summary>Fructan carbohydrate polymer compose fructose terminal glucose moiety . Fructans naturally find artichoke ( 6.1 grams/serving ) , leeks ( 5.9 grams/serving ) , onion bulb ( 1.01 grams/serving ) , flour ( 4.0 grams/serving ) , garlic ( .52 grams/serving ) , watermelon ( .92 grams/serving ) , nectarine ( .27 grams/serving ) white peach ( .50 grams/serving ) . Because fructans present many common food , people typically ingest high level fructan . The common structural form fructan inulin , levanare geraminan . The human body absorb 5 % fructan , however estimate daily intake USA may vary 1-20 gram , possibly high due recently discover benefit inulin . Dietary trend indicate high level fructans common European American diet , wheat base product breakfast cereal , pasta , bread consume . Fructans may well tolerate subject malabsorption may result gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptoms heartburn , belching , abdominal pain , diarrhea , gas , bloat ; especially true high dos ingest . Unlike glucose , fructans efficiently digest absorbed small intestine . The mechanism malabsorption relate inability hydrolyze glycosidic linkages complex polysaccharide , result delivery malabsorbed fructans large bowel1 . In colon , malabsorbed fructans rapidly ferment , byproducts fermentation include H2 , CH4 , gas may contribute bowel symptom . Furthermore , small molecular nature fructans result osmotic effect draw water small intestine cause bloat diarrhea . Ingestion high dos fructans cause symptom healthy adult , may cause bothersome symptom subject Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) . Earlier study identify IBS affect 10 15 % population United States . Ingestion 10-20 gram fructan daily may cause symptom IBS , restrict fructan intake diet may reduce symptom variety gastrointestinal disorder . One study recently publish find dietary restriction fructan fructose responsible symptomatic improvement patient IBS . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize healthy individual absorb fructan 7.5 gram 10 gram dos , experience malabsorption 12.5 gram fructan dose .</brief_summary>
