	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Versus Open Pancreatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open distal pancreatectomy without splenectomy commonly employ treatment variety pancreatic disease . Although many general surgical procedure increasingly perform laparoscopically laparoscopic assistance , current decade , laparoscopic pancreatic surgery perform . Surgeons Indiana University Hospital safely apply laparoscopic surgery select patient pancreatic disease since 2003 . Recently , outcomes laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy Indiana University combination multiple institution review presented American Surgical Association Meeting 2008 . These data suggest laparoscopic compare open distal pancreatectomy may associate low blood loss ( 357 vs. 588 cc , p &lt; 0.01 ) , few complication ( 40 vs. 57 % , p &lt; 0.01 ) , short hospital stay ( 5.9 vs. 9.0 day , p &lt; 0.01 ) . Furthermore , laparoscopic approach independent predictor short hospital stay . The main criticism retrospective study similarly design study likely selection bias patient undergo laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy may account apparent positive result favor laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy . In word , patient factor , operative approach may predictive outcome . Based data , however , laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy appear least safe open distal pancreatectomy . Currently , either technique consider `` standard care '' Indiana University Hospital well several institution US expertise laparoscopic pancreas surgery . To determine whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy truly superior open distal pancreatectomy term outcome , propose randomize patient laparoscopic vs open distal pancreatectomy . In addition randomization , patient preoperatively stratify accord whether diagnosis pancreatic adenocarcinoma , outcomes specific group patient may examine . Patients adenocarcinoma randomize separately insure equal group laparoscopic open distal pancreatectomy group specific diagnosis . Patients neuroendocrine/islet cell tumor also randomize separately insure equal group laparoscopic open distal pancreatectomy group specific diagnosis . Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy adenocarcinoma neuroendocrine/islet cell tumor uncommon ( e.g. , 9 adenocarcinoma last 5 year perform laparoscopically IU ) , thus clear outset conclusion limit patient diagnosis . Although submit single institution study , strongly consider multi-institutional study design near future . Patients enrol intention-to-treat manner . Thus , patient randomize laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy require conversion open pancreatectomy still include laparoscopic group overall comparative analysis . Subgroup analyse , however , also perform exclude cross-over group . Objectives : Primary : The primary objective determine whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy associate improve outcome compare open distal pancreatectomy . Retrospective data suggest blood loss , overall complication rate hospital length stay positively influence laparoscopic approach . Thus , specific outcome examine : 1. estimate blood loss 2. overall complication rate 3. hospital length stay Secondary : 1. determine whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy safe patient pancreatic adenocarcinoma 2. establish distal pancreatectomy registry</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patient eligible open distal pancreatectomy also eligible laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy . There absolute contraindication . The situation patient ineligible he/she prefers one approach individual surgeon prefers one approach . NOTE : Patients suspicion high likelihood metastatic pancreatic cancer ( minority patient trial ) undergo diagnostic laparoscopy . If tumor metastatic ( confined pancreas ) patient longer candidate distal pancreatectomy ( trial ) . The procedure diagnostic laparoscopy set potential confounder trial randomize patient laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy . Due importance cancer patient trial , instead exclude patient randomization simply undergoing laparoscopy , set limit diagnostic laparoscopy . The limit include use 2 laparoscopic port ( total ) diagnostic laparoscopy must perform set distal pancreatectomy . Thus , randomization open distal pancreatectomy , patient go operate room , patient may undergo diagnostic laparoscopy limit ( 2 port , set surgery ) prior undergo open distal pancreatectomy . This issue patient randomize laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy , since patient go operate room diagnostic laparoscopy , may transition laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy allow 5 port total . Patients eligible enrollment study pancreas disease condition undergo distal pancreatectomy . Indications distal pancreatectomy determine surgeon care patient . Patients must undergo informed consent study prior surgery . Patients must eligible undergo open laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy time randomization occur . Female patient childbearing age must negative urine serum pregnancy test prior enrollment . Patients randomized laparoscopic technique require conversion open technique remain trial due intentiontotreat design study . Patients despite pancreas disease condition fit surgical candidate thus undergo distal pancreatectomy . Patients fail eligible undergo open laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy anytime randomization occur . Patients undergoing total pancreatectomy . Patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy previous rightsided pancreatic resection ( i.e. , pancreaticoduodenectomy ) Failure sign inform consent . Pediatric patient ( &lt; 18 year age ) exclude study . Patients pregnant . Patients extensive pancreatitis peripancreatic inflammation relative contraindication . Patients portal sinistral hypertension relative contraindication .</criteria>
