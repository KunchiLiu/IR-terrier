	<brief_summary>While undisputable evidence relate elevate plasma low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol level increase risk coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , increasingly recognize significant proportion CHD event occur individual characterize cluster additional metabolic physiological perturbation define metabolic syndrome . Epidemiological clinical evidence show u nutritional factor , often conjunction obesity , play pivotal role pathophysiology metabolic syndrome . In regard , accumulate evidence suggest Mediterranean-style diet ( MedDiet ) may beneficially modify several component metabolic syndrome include plasma triglyceride ( TG ) high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol level , insulin resistance , waist circumference marker vascular inflammation . However , physiological mechanism underlie cardioprotective effect MedDiet feature metabolic syndrome importance body weight reduction maximize effect represent key issue yet investigate . The general objective study investigate first time control feeding study mechanisms factor underlie impact MedDiet , without weight loss dyslipidemic feature metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study duration 35 week participant . Subjects first assign North American control diet consume five week isocaloric , weight-maintaining condition . Participants consume MedDiet 5 week , isocaloric , weight-maintaining condition . All food provide participant consecutive 5-week diet . Participants subsequently undergo 20-week weight loss period free-living condition give advice create 500 kcal deficit daily energy intake . The last phase study consist second 5-week MedDiet consume feeding , weight stabilize condition . Metabolic study CHD risk factor assessment perform end experimental diet . Metabolic study include measurement vivo kinetics apolipoprotein ( apo ) B-containing lipoprotein include small dense LDL , apoCIII , HDL ( apoAI ) C-reactive protein ( CRP ) well indirect measure cholesterol absorption synthesis .</detailed_description>
