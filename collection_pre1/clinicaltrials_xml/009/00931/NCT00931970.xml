	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1. compare complication mortality hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis Korean end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient ; 2. analyze treatment effect quality life ( QOL ) dialysis modality ; 3. analyze cost-effectiveness dialysis modality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mode Dialysis Therapy Outcomes End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number ESRD patient grow much faster rate total population , almost 1,000 ( 941.7 ) ESRD patient per one million 2006 . The ESRD prevalence Korea rank high 10th globally . The common underlying disease ESRD Korea include diabetes ( 42.3 % ) , hypertension ( 16.9 % ) , chronic glomerulonephritis ( 13.0 % ) . Diabetes hypertension continuously increase , number elderly patient due population age . From examples foreign country 2-to-3 fold large dialysis population per million Korea ( ex . Japan , Taiwan , US ) , dialysis population forecast skyrocket . According 2003 data National Health Insurance Corporation investigate disease high yearly treatment cost 5 million KRW , chronic renal failure ( CRF ) rank first men woman . It single expensive disease 2000 , 212 billion KRW medical spending 18,000 CRF patient , represent significant burden national healthcare budget . The ESRD Patient Registry run Korean Society Nephrology ( KSN ) require dialysis institution annually report number ESRD patient receive renal replacement therapy , type underlie disease , dialysis modality , cause death . Though KSN statistic useful isolated epidemiological data , program participation rate 60 % , case death rarely report . Clinical research treatment prognosis CRF Korea mostly perform single hospital university , prospective , long-term , multi-center study perform yet . The American Society Nephrology , National Kidney Foundation , American Association Kidney Patients produce treatment guideline base effectiveness safety proven clinical trial . In UK , NKRF MRC build database cardiovascular complication chronic renal disease outcomes different treatment method . Industrialized country include US , UK , Japan develop standard treatment guideline thoroughly investigate etiology , progression , treatment , cardiovascular complication compare effectiveness know treatment . The 5-year survival rate ESRD patient Korea 37.8 % peritoneal dialysis patient 65.2 % hemodialysis patient , respectively . There big discrepancy patient 's survival HD PD Korea . However , suspicious whether survival data convincing . QOL maintenance dialysis patient extremely low . Co-morbidity time lose dialysis make difficult return work cause frequent hospitalization . Though QOL might vary depend country , culture , race , dialysis modality , multi-center study evaluate Korea . CRF cause large per-patient health insurance reimbursement government , patient population continuously grow . Hospital stay prolong due serious complication require multi-disciplinary consultation drive medical cost . A cost-effectiveness study urgently require . As industrialized country , resource need development clinical practice guideline provide national government . `` Effective clinical practice guideline '' low healthcare cost prevent unnecessary medical practice promote socioeconomic benefit quality care . The national government relate medical society yet come clinical practice guideline . Efforts make work `` KOREAN clinical practice guideline '' prevent clinical physician rely foreign guideline , reflect possibility racial difference proven effect Koreans , engage improper medical practice . Our research content . 1 . Basic data input dialysis modality . 2 . Collection data comorbidity residual renal function baseline . 3 . Collection data referral time history emergent dialysis . 4 . Comparative analysis short-term QOL within 1 year begin dialysis . 5 . Comparative analysis complication dialysis modality . 6 . Comparative analysis short-term patient/descriptive mortality risk factor . 7 . Creation infection prevention treatment guideline dialysis patient . 8 . Comparative analysis patient/descriptive mortality ( 3-year ) , complication , risk factor dialysis modality . 9 . Analysis cost-effectiveness dialysis modality : survival rate QOL versus cost . 10 . Comparative analysis residual renal function , rate decline , survival rate dialysis modality .</detailed_description>
