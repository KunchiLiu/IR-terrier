	<brief_summary>Objective : To study relative balance GABA ( A ) bind potential glutamate utilization subject localization-related epilepsy without depression , subject major depressive disorder alone , subject generalize epilepsy ( expect significant comorbid depression ) . Pilot data show GABA ( A ) bind potential glutamate utilization tightly couple healthy subject particularly mesial temporal lobe . We hypothesize subject epilepsy exhibit degree coupling , subject epilepsy depression exhibit even pronounce decouple . Study Population : Subjects age 18-55 localization-related epilepsy without depression , subject generalize epilepsy , subject major depressive disorder ( MDD ) alone , healthy control . Design : This neuroimaging study , use positron emission tomography ( PET ) [ 11C ] flumazenil , measure GABA ( A ) bind potential , [ 18F ] fluorodeoxyglucose , measure glucose utilization ( reflective neuronal glutamate release ) Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) , use measure GABA glutamate mesial temporal cortex , corroborate PET result . Structural magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) obtain MRS localization partial volume correction PET image . Outcome measure : The bind potential GABA ( A ) , regional rate glucose metabolism , level GABA glutamate measure MRS . Patients stratified seizure type depression rating .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Male female subject age 18 55 year Epileptic patient must clinically document partial seizure , either leave right temporal lobe , generalize seizure consistent EEG evidence define 1981 International Classification Epileptic Seizures , refractory standard antiepileptic treatment least one year . This criterion establish preliminary screening NINDS CES outpatient clinic , , previous study adequate , inpatient videoEEG monitoring . All subject epilepsy must exhibit seizure adequately control medication alone , despite adequate trial multiple agent . Subjects epilepsy must currently take AED exerts primary method action system GABA . Examples include sodium calcium channel blocker ( phenytoin , carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine , lamotrigine , zonisamide , ethosuximide ) , drug bind SV2A site ( levetiracetam ) , drug bind alpha2delta subunit calcium channel ( gabapentin pregbalin ) . Patients AEDs direct effect GABA glutamate ( vigabatrin , phenobarbital , benzodiazepine , tiagabine ) exclude . No subject medication change purpose inclusion study . Patients TLE depression must currently meet DSMIV criterion category `` Mood disorder due epilepsy '' ( 293.83 ) , subtype `` Major DepressiveLike Episode '' , 296.2 Major Depressive Disorder , Single Episode , 296.3 Major Depressive Disorder , Recurrent , indicate subject meet diagnostic criterion major depressive episode . Patients MDD alone must currently meet DSMIV criterion Major Depressive Disorder , also either family history mood disorder , history multiple major depressive episode . Healthy control subject meet criterion DSMIV axis I psychiatric disorder , family history ( first degree relative ) mood anxiety disorder also recruit . Subjects must able give write informed consent prior participation study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects major medical neurological disorder ( besides TLE generalize epileptiform disorder ) expect influence cerebral blood flow morphology Subjects epilepsy take medication ( antiepileptic drug ) may affect cerebral blood flow , GABA glutamate neurotransmission , metabolism . Subjects epilepsy take AED know exert direct effect GABA glutamate . Subjects epilepsy depression take antidepressant drug within 2 week study ( 4 week fluoxetine ) Medically healthy depress subject take drug , include antidepressant , expect influence cerebral blood flow , metabolism , morphology within 2 week study ( 4 week fluoxetine ) Healthy subject take medication expect influence cerebral blood flow , metabolism , morphology . Healthy subject must free personal history seizure disorder In order exclude subject atrisk development mood disorder , healthy control subject must free either personal family history ( firstdegree relative ) Axis I psychiatric disorder Subjects history drug alcohol abuse within one year , lifetime history alcohol drug dependence ( DSMIV criterion ) . Subjects consume excessive amount alcohol ( 7 drink per week woman , 14 drink per week men ) also exclude . Subjects structural lesion visible MRI , exclude mesial temporal sclerosis Subjects suicidal ideation , past history suicide attempt Subjects psychotic symptom Subjects MRI contraindicate Female subject lactate pregnant Subjects IQ le 80 exclude study .</criteria>
