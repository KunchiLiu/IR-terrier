	<brief_summary>Patients relapse solid tumor sarcomas neuroblastoma poor survival , generally &lt; 20 % . There urgent need new treatment safe effective . HSV1716 , oncolytic virus , mutant herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) type I , delete RL1 gene encodes protein ICP34.5 , specific determinant virulence . Mutants lack RL1 gene capable replication actively divide cell terminally differentiate cell - phenotype exploit selectively kill tumor cell . In previous clinical study , HSV1716 show safe injected dos 10^5 plaque form unit ( pfu ) directly human high-grade glioma normal brain adjacent tumour , follow excision high-grade glioma . In extension study , HSV1716 show safe inject dose 10^6 pfu directly brain tumour . Replication HSV1716 human glioblastoma situ demonstrate . Following single administration HSV1716 direct injection active recurrent tumor brain adjacent tumor , patient live long might expect . This study seek evaluate safety single injection HSV1716 treatment extracranial solid tumor adolescent young adult . HSV1716 also prove safe give direct intra-tumoural injection patient squamous carcinoma head neck , patient malignant melanoma . Replication HSV mutant human sarcomas neuroblastoma culture cell human xenograft model demonstrate . This study design two part . PART 1 study specifies single dose virus . Participants experience least stable disease relapse follow determination stable disease , may qualify subsequent dos PART 2 . PART 2 require sign separate consent .
