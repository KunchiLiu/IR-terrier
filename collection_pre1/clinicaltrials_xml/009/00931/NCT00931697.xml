	<brief_summary>Mefloquine quinolinemethanol antimalarial effective therapy prophylaxis specie malaria infect human , include multi-drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum . The marketed anti-malaria drug consist two enantiomer mefloquine . Mefloquine 's clinical utility impair association neuropsychiatric side effect . The pharmacological basis mefloquine 's side effect know two reported hypothesis relate action ( ) adenosine receptor ( ii ) effect cholinesterase enzyme . For mechanism , significant stereoselective activity two enantiomer . In vitro study show ( - ) isomer 50-100 fold potent towards adenosine receptor compare ( + ) isomer . In addition , ( - ) -mefloquine considerably anti-cholinesterase activity . It therefore hypothesise ( + ) -mefloquine may better central nervous system ( CNS ) safety profile compare either racemate ( - ) -mefloquine . This study randomize , ascend dose , double-blind , active placebo-controlled , parallel group study healthy male female volunteer design investigate hypothesis describe comparative pharmacokinetics racemate single enantiomer .</brief_summary>
