	<detailed_description>Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) chronic , inflammatory skin disease characterize dry , red , itchy patch become thickened lichenified time . Contact Dermatitis , Allergic Contact Dermatitis ( ACD ) , eczematous reaction response environmental allergen . The etiology Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) Allergic Contact Dermatitis ( ACD ) completely elucidate , new understanding underlie mechanism expand focused treatment regimens paradigm . Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) think mediate Th2 type T cell elaborate number cytokine block vitro apremilast . The chronic Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) pathway may involve change Th1 cytokine . Genetic factor contribute much course Allergic Contact Dermatitis ( ACD ) Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) . Rather , Allergic Contact Dermatitis ( ACD ) type IV , T-cell mediate , delayed-hypersensitivity reaction self-limited . Similar Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) , number pro-inflammatory cytokine involve recruit T cell preferentially skin : Th1 cytokine , Th2 cytokine , CD8 cytokine , T-regulatory cytokine . These pathway Allergic Contact Dermatitis ( ACD ) activate IFN-γ , driven TNF-α , , apremilast show block cytokine vitro . Current treatment Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) Allergic Contact Dermatitis ( ACD ) include skin care , trigger avoidance ( especially case ACD ) , topical corticosteroid , steroid sparing treatment , antihistamine , topical systemic antibiotic , ultraviolet light . For recalcitrant Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) Allergic Contact Dermatitis ( ACD ) case , several immunosuppressive treatment exist . Subjects recalcitrant Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) Allergic Contact Dermatitis ( ACD ) exhaust conventional systemic treatment option respond conventional systemic therapy use agent due side effect cumulative toxicity . There urgent need evaluate new therapeutic option recalcitrant Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) Allergic Contact Dermatitis ( ACD ) . Very available drug recalcitrant Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) Allergic Contact Dermatitis ( ACD ) reasonable efficacy safety profile condition , easily available , easy administer . A new treatment strategy need treatment recalcitrant contact atopic dermatitis would increase efficacy , minimize toxicity short long-term treatment , easy administer . The availability alternative drug treatment ( ) offer safe effective short long-term management would significantly benefit subject recalcitrant contact atopic dermatitis . This study use novel oral agent ( apremilast ) modulate multiple anti-inflammatory pathway target phosphodiesterase type IV ( PDE4 ) inhibition decrease expression dermatitis . Apremilast pharmacodynamic property potential therapeutic benefit treat inflammatory autoimmune disorder involve elevate serum cytokine level , include Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) Allergic Contact Dermatitis ( ACD ) .</detailed_description>
