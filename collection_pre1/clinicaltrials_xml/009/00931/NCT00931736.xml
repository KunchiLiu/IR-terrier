	<detailed_description>On global scale , tuberculosis ( TB ) single important infectious cause morbidity mortality . The World Health Organization estimate one-third entire world 's population carry latent TB infection . Of 8 million develop active disease , 2 million die TB year . In Canada , industrialized country , incidence TB fell dramatically 1900 late 1970 's , since decline slow , TB continue cause significant morbidity , mortality disadvantage population . A key TB control strategy therapy latent TB infection ( LTBI ) . The current standard regimen 9 month Isoniazid ( 9INH ) . This regimen excellent efficacy take regularly , effectiveness substantially reduce poor compliance . Serious side effect , hepato-toxicity occur . Three short alternative recommend : 6 month INH ( 6INH ) , 2 month Rifampin - Pyrazinamide ( 2RIF-PZA ) 4 month Rifampin ( 4RIF ) . Based evidence treatment LTBI , extrapolate extensive experience treatment active TB , believe 4RIF similar efficacy 9INH . The investigator initiate research program evaluate compliance , safety , cost effectiveness 4RIF treatment LTBI . In initial study 116 patient , 4RIF associate significantly high completion rate ( 90 % vs 70 % ) . The second phase study , conduct Montreal , Toronto , Kingston , Saskatoon , Calgary , Edmonton , plus Brazil Saudi Arabia , compare rate serious adverse event ( SAE ) two regimen . These adjudicate independent three member review panel , blind study drug . In phase , among 420 subject randomize 4RIF overall rate Grade 3-4 SAE 2.4 % compare 5.6 % among 427 take 9INH ( p=.02 ) . Grade 3-4 hepatotoxicity significantly low ( 0.7 % vs 3.8 % ; p=.003 ) . Health system cost also significantly low , completion rate significantly high 4RIF Therefore condition meet conduct first randomize trial compare effectiveness 4RIF 9INH prevent tuberculosis . Among moderate high risk subject eligible , anticipated cumulative risk active TB , untreated , least 3 % follow-up 28 month randomization . We anticipate 50 % completion rate 9INH , provide effectiveness 45 % ( base know efficacy 90 % ) . To detect superior effectiveness 4RIF , assume 80 % completion , 10 % loss follow-up , plus accounting cluster randomization household contact would require enrolment 3283 subject per arm , total 6,566 subject . This reduced 5720 , 847 already randomize Phase 2 , randomize , treat follow 28 month post-randomization determine occurrence active TB - use method describe proposal . Eligible consent subject randomize equal number 9INH 4RIF , web-based registration randomization program , stratify site block variable size ( 2-8 subject ) . Subjects follow usual provider therapy every 3 month 28 month post-randomization occurrence study end-point . The primary study outcome occurrence , 28 month randomization , microbiologically histologically confirm active TB . The final diagnosis base majority opinion independent 3-member clinical review panel , review subject investigated TB , without knowledge study drug , clinical diagnosis . Planned sub-group analysis compare rate active TB complete treatment per protocol ( efficacy ) . Secondary outcome include occurrence confirm plus probable active TB , Grade 3-4 adverse event ( judge another blind , independent 3-member panel Phase 2 ) , occurrence drug resistant active TB , cost - health system perspective . To accomplish , Canada one site add Vancouver , site Brazil double , new site Korea , Australia , Indonesia , Benin , Guinea Ghana ( West Africa ) add . In addition parent trial , investigator include additional component call `` Biomarker Study '' . For part study investigator take additional 10 mls blood pre-treatment , well four nine month start treatment . In total extra 30ml blood ( equal 2 tablespoon ) require 9 month , two additional veni-punctures , since veni-punctures routinely perform 4 9 month time point . Three 10 ml use QFT-GIT test , remain 7 ml serum separate stored -80Â°C future biomarker study . For subject randomize 4RIF , blood draw nine month require extra visit clinic , study subject compensate . No specimen store future genetic testing . For present time Montreal site participate component . Other site join funding secure . All lab assay perform final year study , enhance cost-effectiveness .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult ( age 18 year old ) document positive TST ( absence TST , document positive QFT ) prescribe 9 month Isoniazid LTBI , follow authoritative recommendation . Patients contact TB case know resistant Isoniazid , Rifampin , . Known HIVinfected individual antiretroviral agent whose efficacy would substantially reduce Rifampin , unless therapy safely change agent affected Rifampin . Pregnant woman Rifampin Isoniazid consider safe pregnancy therapy usually defer 23 month postpartum avoid fetal risk potential increase hepatotoxicity immediately post partum . Patients medication clinically important drug interaction Isoniazid Rifampin , physician believe would make either arm contraindicate . Patients history allergy/hypersensitivity Isoniazid Rifampin , Rifabutin Rifapentine . Patients active TB . Patients initially suspect active TB randomize exclude . Patients already start LTBI therapy .</criteria>
