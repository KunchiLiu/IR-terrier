	<brief_summary>The investigator hope determine `` wet '' AMD patient differ patient `` dry '' AMD normal eye production anti-retinal pigment epithelium ( anti-RPE ) anti-retinal antibody formation . To explain : immune system make antibody attack cell , specifically RPE retina . Normally RPE retinal cell ignore immune system , disease occurs , immune reaction occur , make autoantibody attack patient 's cell make thing bad . This production autoantibodies react RPE retinal cell investigator want test proposal see may contribute , responsible , poor response treatment . The investigator also want know patient initially respond standard-of-care treatment , ranibizumab injection , differ production anti-RPE anti-retinal antibody formation , patient respond initially 4 consecutive injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Up 10 % patient neovascular AMD treat ranibizumab respond poorly worsen despite therapy . The reason lack response unclear . We preliminary data suggest abnormal autoimmune activity apparent patient . Previous study show evidence retinal autoimmunity AMD patient , little data describe specific immunologic commonality correlate disease and/or poor response . ( 8,9 ) Perhaps significantly little data regard immunologic activity age-matched normal , make publish data hard evaluate especially age group autoimmunity know increase . ( 8,9 ) While many know retinal antigen autoimmune retinal disease , role antigen well establish AMD antigen identify . ( 24 ) Moreover , RPE-reactivities begin understood ocular disease . ( 25-27 ) We intend address humoral response AMD make systematic comparison immunologic activity ranibizumab responder , ranibizumab initial non-responders , comparable population age-sex-race match normal control . Data suggest 5 group patient evident 3 treatment ranibizumab : 1 ) rapid responder , 2 ) delay responder , 3 ) gradual responder , 4 ) acutenon-responders 5 ) chronic non-responders . We hypothesize non-responders gradual responder may fact patient complicate underlying autoimmune activity involve retinal RPE antigen , expose secondary breakdown blood-retinal barrier CNV development . We study humoral response ( antibody production ) treatment period , likely change different rate patient different response . In addition correlate underlying genetic phenotype patient . For study , plan look 2 treatment group 2 control group : - Group 1 : patient neovascular AMD respond ranibizumab 4 consecutive injection ranibizumab - Group 2 : age-sex-race match normal population control ( without AMD ) - Group 3 : patient neovascular AMD acute non-responders anti-VEGF treatment 4 consecutive injection - Group 4 : age-sex-race match dry AMD patient ( AREDS category 2/3 ou ) control - Group 5 : patient neovascular AMD chronic non-responders anti-VEGF treatment 4 consecutive injection This open-label study assess antibody formation ( anti-RPE anti-retinal ) 5 group . Group 1 ( n=40 ) include neovascular AMD patient treat ranibizumab . Patients include receive 4 ranibizumab 0.5mg intravitreally 4-6 week interval twice `` need '' ( PRN ) 4-6 week interval . After 4th ranibizumab injection , Group 1 patient respond ( persistent fluid OCT ) , move Group 3 ( anti-VEGF acute non-responders ) Group 5 ( anti-VEGF chronic non-responders ) . This reduce eventual number subject enrol Group 1 approximately 36 , anticipate approximately 4 subject move either Group 3 Group 5 non-responder . Group 2 ( n=40 ) age-sex-race match normal subject population AMD . Group 3 ( n=8 ) Group 5 ( n=7 ) ( combine total 15 subject , approximately 4 transfer Group 1 ) include patient treat 4 injection anti-VEGF treatment 4-8 week interval without initial response ( Initial non-response define &lt; 100 micron improve [ decrease ] retinal thickening OCT ) . Group 3 patient , acute non-responders , include 4th injection follow 2 visit 4-8 week interval time receive `` need '' anti-VEGF treatment ( ) investigator 's discretion fluid OCT. Group 4 ( n=40 ) age-sex-race match patient Dry AMD control immune response neovascular response . Group 5 patient , chronic non-responders , include 4th injection follow one ( 1 ) visit Month 4 time receive `` need '' anti-VEGF treatment investigator 's discretion fluid OCT . NOTE : Only 10 % Group 1 ( approximately 4 patient ) expect non-responders , therefore , 11 Group 3 Group 5 subject patient treat outside study find non-responders chart review . These patient enrol Month 4 visit supplement subject transfer Group 1 total 15 patient Groups 3 5 . We use Western blotting global assessment autoantibody full complement retinal protein normal individual ( Group 2 ) treat exudative AMD ( Group 1 ) , initial non-responders ranibizumab ( Group 3 ) , patient `` dry '' AMD ( Group 4 ) . Genotyping ( CFH HTRA1 ) perform Groups . Approximately 25 ml ( 2 tablespoon ) blood send Dr. Khang Zhang Shiley Eye Center University California , San Diego perform genetics analysis . This study investigate antibody production differs nv AMD patient ( Groups 1 , 3 5 ) normal population ( Group 2 ) , differs ranibizumab responder ( Group 1 ) non-responders anti-VEGF treatment ( Groups 3 5 ) , also see patient dry AMD ( Group 4 ) compare nv AMD group ( Groups 1 , 3 , 5 ) .</detailed_description>
