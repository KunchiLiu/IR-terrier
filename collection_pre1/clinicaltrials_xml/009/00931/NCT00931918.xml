	<brief_summary>This randomize , open-label , multi-center , phase 2 study RCHOP without VELCADE adult patient previously untreated non- ( Germinal B-Cell-like ) GCB Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . The study determine whether addition VELCADE RCHOP improve progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient non-GCB DLBCL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Effectiveness RCHOP With Without VELCADE Previously Untreated Non-Germinal Center B-Cell-like Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call bortezomib ( VELCADE速 ) . VELCADE速 test people Non-Germinal Center B-Cell-like Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma . This study look efficacy RCHOP [ rituximab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine prednisone ] without VELCADE速 . The study enrol 206 patient . Participants enrol one two open label treatment group : - RCHOP - Vc-RCHOP [ bortezomib ( VELCADE速 ) , rituximab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine prednisone ] Participants receive treatment six , 21-day cycle . This multi-center trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study 48 month . Participants make multiple visit clinic , follow progression free survival overall survival patient withdrawal , death , 2 year last participant enrol .</detailed_description>
