	<brief_summary>This multi-center , randomize , blind , two-period , two-sequence , crossover study , minimum 3-week washout period treatments.The study design evaluate bioequivalence SID530 Taxotere . It conduct study participant locally advance metastatic NSCLC fail platinum therapy also participants locally advanced metastatic breast cancer fail least one line chemotherapy . Eligible study participant must plan least two consecutive 21-day cycle 75 mg/m2 docetaxel monotherapy . The duration study participation approximately 7 week . The study three study phase : Screening ( &lt; =1 week ) , Cycle 1 ( 21 day ) , Cycle 2 ( 21 day ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate SID 530 Compared Taxotere</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participant meet eligibility criterion randomize one two treatment sequence ( i.e. , SID530 Day 1 follow Taxotere Day 21 Taxotere Day 1 follow SID530 Day 21 ) . Randomization stratify whether study participant receive prior docetaxel treatment . All study participant premedicated oral dexamethasone , 16 mg per day ( e.g . 8 mg b.i.d . ) three day , start one day prior study drug infusion , order reduce incidence severity fluid retention well severity hypersensitivity reaction . During treatment cycle , test reference treatment receive identical dosage docetaxel ( i.e. , 75 mg/m2 , i.v . infusion , 1 hour ) . Study completion define complete protocol-specified procedure . Study participant prematurely withdraw study request complete assessment conduct Final Visit . Blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis obtain predefined time Cycle 1 Cycle 2 . Adverse event assess throughout study , include 21 day last study drug infusion . Hematology assessment , laboratory parameter vital sign assess .</detailed_description>
