	<brief_summary>Sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) frequent disorder characterize combination repeat event partial complete upper airway obstruction sleep , disruption normal ventilation , hypoxemia , sleep fragmentation . When untreated , SDB associate serious cardiovascular neurobehavioral morbidity . Many physiologic change occur pregnancy may compromise respiratory system place woman risk develop SDB . Indeed , snore report 46 % pregnant woman . Preliminary evidence suggest SDB associate hypertensive condition pregnancy oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction mechanism important development condition . Moreover , early report animal human suggest maternal SDB may affect develop fetus intermittent hypoxia increase sympathetic activity induce SDB could potentially contribute adverse maternal-fetal outcome . However , previous report focus crude non specific measure fetal outcome birth weight APGAR ( Appearance , Pulse , Grimace , Activity , Respiration ) score currently data mechanism underlie adverse effect maternal SDB fetus newborn infant . Hypothesis : SDB pregnancy imposes risk develop fetus newborn infant mechanism mediate maternal hypoxia . Objectives : 1 . To prospectively investigate incidence severity SDB pregnancy use objective tool , i.e. , overnight polysomnography ( PSG ) at-home sleep study use portable device large cohort pregnant woman . 2 . To examine effect maternal SDB fetal neonatal outcome . Methods : 300 woman third trim singleton uncomplicated pregnancy , attend low risk obstetric surveillance recruit . Hundred woman hospitalize Antenatal department due pregnancy relate hypertensive disorder , intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) , diabetes mellitus premature labor also recruit . In addition , 200 woman singleton uncomplicated pregnancy recruit labor delivery room . All participant ask complete designate sleep questionnaire . Based questionnaire , woman third trim undergo sleep study . Medical record review conduct delivery include information maternal blood pressure , labor duration , route delivery , infant birth weight APGAR score . Placentas collect immediately delivery woman . Cord blood obtain immediately delivery analyzed . Post-natal neurobehavioral evaluation conduct . Data analysis perform 4 population subgroup : ( 1 ) Sleep study proven SDB , ( 2 ) Sleep study proven non-SDB , ( 3 ) SDB per questionnaire , ( 4 ) non-SDB per questionnaire . Comparisons fetal outcome measure accord group assignment perform . In addition , association severity SDB base sleep study ( degree hypoxemia , degree sleep fragmentation , amount respiratory event ) outcome measure perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sleep questionnaire : The questionnaire base validated questionnaire include information snoring , sleep pause daytime sleepiness.Completed questionnaire review weekly , woman either severe daytime sleepiness self report frequent snore degree sleep apnea contact requested undergo clinical evaluation overnight polysomnography ( estimate - 100 woman ) . This evaluation consist in-depth sleep relate general medical history physical examination include body mass measurement ( height , weight , neck circumference ) . Tissue umbilical cord blood collection : Placentas evaluate single pathologist . The pathologist blind medical perinatal history gestational age . Each placenta examine use criterion previously report . Cord blood obtain birth double clamp umbilical vein process immediately fetal blood gas analysis . Immediately follow delivery , 5 mL blood obtain umbilical cord baby . Neuro-behavioral evaluation newborn conduct first 48 hour life .</detailed_description>
