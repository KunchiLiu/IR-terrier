	<brief_summary>1 . The purpose research study evaluate non-invasive marker celiac disease activity subject gluten-free diet , remission celiac disease undergo gluten challenge . 2 . The secondary aim protocol identify novel mediator important pathophysiology celiac disease evaluate change metabolism gluten exposure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serum Markers Gluten Challenge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diagnosis celiac disease carry important ramification . Celiac disease systemic immunologic disorder sentinel lesion enteropathy trigger polypeptide derive primarily gliadin protein find wheat , rye barley . Ingestion offend protein lead inflammation intestinal mucosal damage , result spectrum abdominal symptom , increase intestinal permeability , malabsorption , occult gastrointestinal bleeding diarrhea . Systemic manifestation celiac disease include myriad condition include malignancy autoimmune disease . The accepted treatment celiac disease lifelong adherence gluten free diet . Adherence diet , simply put avoid food contain even small amount wheat , rye barley , show lead improvement majority relate problem normalization standard diagnostic test . Because many individual present evaluation possible celiac disease already gluten free diet test accurately currently way differentiate healthy individual individual well treat celiac disease . The standard practice case perform 'Gluten Challenge ' whereby patient eat equivalent 2 slice bread per day six eight week return evaluation serologic test endoscopy duodenal biopsy . The use gluten challenge clinical practice limit patient symptom resistance long test period , may take number week intestine heal symptom resolve . Autoantibodies tissue transglutaminase antibody deamidated gliadin , excellent tool predict celiac disease patient long-term gluten contain diet , display low sensitivity detect short-term and/or recent gluten exposure . For reason , would useful novel circulating marker could identify indicate presence celiac disease particular would provide early less invasive marker positive response gluten challenge .</detailed_description>
