	<brief_summary>People stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA `` mini-stroke '' ) high risk another stroke heart attack . Conditions like high blood pressure high cholesterol , along lifestyle behavior ( e.g. , smoke ) , substantially increase risk stroke heart disease . Aggressive treatment risk factor however , significantly reduce chance another stroke , heart attack death . This study look different way optimize blood pressure cholesterol level educate people positive lifestyle change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Recurrent Vascular Events Patients With Stroke Transient Ischemic Attack</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Epidemiological study show number condition increase risk stroke vascular disease compel evidence large randomized trial treatment risk factor , especially hypertension high cholesterol , significantly low future cardiovascular risk . Survivors TIA stroke high risk recurrent stroke , MI , death ( 22 % one year ) aggressive treatment vascular risk factor reduce risk recurrence 25 % . However , vascular risk factor , especially hypertension high cholesterol , manage optimally patient TIA stroke , even patient see specialized Stroke Prevention Clinics ( SPCs ) . This gap evidence secondary prevention stroke clinical reality lead sub-optimal patient outcome . There limited data intervention proven improve outcome patient stroke TIA . To improve quality care condition patient population , one need address structure , process , outcomes . In study , create test new structure delivery stroke prevention service - anticipate new structure improve process care turn lead improve outcome . Hypothesis : Compared usual care , hypothesize pharmacist case manager intervention improve blood pressure serum lipid level ( employ standardize treatment protocol guideline-recommended target ) , management risk factor , enhance medication adherence , increase health-related quality life . Design : A prospective , randomize , control open-label blind ascertainment outcome ( PROBE ) trial . Patients recent stroke TIA evaluate 3 stroke prevention clinic ( SPC ) Edmonton , Canada , randomize usual care `` pharmacist case manager intervention '' . Usual care patient receive educational material stroke risk factor medication adherence `` intervention '' patient , see monthly study nurse , number BP measurements `` intervention '' patient , fax send family physician study visit report BP . Over usual care , intervention group include intensive pharmacist case-management 6 month consist follow : - monthly follow-up visit focus vascular protection ; clinic visit run parallel , independent , follow-up SPC include provision patient individual cardiovascular disease risk profile use CV Health Manager software . - Initiation , monitor titration medication relate blood pressure dyslipidemia , use Canadian national guideline-recommended treatment target . - Medication adherence management ongoing basis , include access DosettesÂ® , blister pack , reminder tool deem necessary . - Independent capacity refer ally health service ( include dietician weight loss service , diabetes education centre , smoke cessation counselor ) . - Regular feedback primary care physician stroke specialist record , regard stroke prevention related activity .</detailed_description>
