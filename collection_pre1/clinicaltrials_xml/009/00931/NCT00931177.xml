	<detailed_description>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Objectives : Objective 1 : Validity ; Objective 2 : Reliability ; Objective 3 : To obtain preliminary data determine effectiveness Dehydration Scoring System predict resource utilization disposition . Study Design : This prospective study patient present Emergency Department ( ED ) clinical sign dehydration . All previously healthy child age 1 month ( mo ) 16 year ( yo ) age vomiting , diarrhea , poor oral ( PO ) intake presume gastroenteritis eligible inclusion obtain informed consent assent applicable . Exclusion criterion include history cardiac renal disease , diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , malnutrition failure thrive ( FTT ) , malabsorptive disorder short gut syndrome . Children exclude clinically unstable , require immediate life save intervention parent legal guardian available consent . Clinical measure : Upon obtain informed consent , data sheet start gather study weight , dehydration score specify interval , patient demographic key clinical finding , well resource utilization ( none , oral rehydration therapy ( ORT ) , intravenous ( IV ) therapy , observation status , admission hospital ) . Information regard whether patient receive rotavirus vaccine many dos also collect . As part standard care , patient weigh use either single infant pediatric scale locate triage presentation Pediatric ED ( PED ) ( Time 0 ) ( age appropriate infant scale versus stand stadiometer Triage ) . Infants weigh naked old child hospital gown . Change weight discharge follow ( f/u ) , compare baseline adequate measure dehydration use standardly study nature . Emergency department nurse obtain dehydration score patient transfer treatment room ( time 0 ) . Prior initiation treatment , close nurse 's Dehydration Score possible , clinician ( Faculty , fellow , nurse practitioner physician assistant ) also score patient arrive treatment area prior initiation treatment . Clinicians mask initial Dehydration Score score nurse . Subjects continue receive Dehydration Scores every hour initiation treatment disposition determine ( i.e . discharge home admit hospital ) ( Times T1,2,3â€¦ ) . At discharge , time decision admit make , child weigh scale initially use . Subjects ask return 1 week ( +/- 3 day ) wellness ( dehydration ) score , repeat weight ( scale ) , continuation historical physical examination finding . Research clinical nurse obtain final follow-up Dehydration Score . STATISTICAL METHODS Statistical Analysis Objective 1 : The validity scale , comparison gold standard change weight , assess compare ratio change dehydration score ( discharge minus baseline ) ratio change weight ( discharge minus baseline ) subject . A comparison also make ratio change score ratio change weight use measurement follow-up . Lin 's concordance correlation coefficient estimate comparison . This method measure correlation prefer Pearson 's correlation coefficient , limited estimate degree linearity two test accuracy . Objective 2 : Repeatability Dehydration Scale different raters ( nurse clinician baseline ) test obtain concordance correlation coefficient . Objective 3 : Correlation Dehydration Score resource utilization/disposition outcomes . We characterize mean dehydration score across treatment ( i.e . resource utilization ) , roughly identify cut-points ( natural clinical significance ) estimate predictive value . Sample size calculation : The primary aim propose study evaluate validity dehydration scale compare gold standard change weight . The hypothesis correlation two measure produce correlation least 0.95 , exceed 0.75 cut-off demonstrate 'excellent ' correlation . To detect difference 80 % power ( alpha=0.05 ) , 54 subject sufficient . Assuming significant loss follow-up one week ( ~40-50 % ) , total 100 subject target enrollment ensure 54 subject available test hypothesis correlation change score weight follow-up . This estimated sample size sufficient evaluate interobserver reliability obtain concordance correlation coefficient .</detailed_description>
