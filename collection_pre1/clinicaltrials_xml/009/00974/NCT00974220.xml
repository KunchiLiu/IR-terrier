	<brief_summary>Breathing discomfort ( dyspnea ) activity limitation dominant symptom chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) contribute poor health-related quality life population . Several small , uncontrolled study publish case report provide evidence inhaled fentanyl , powerful pain relieving ( opioid ) medication , may use effectively reduce breathe discomfort patient advanced disease . However , mechanism improvement remain unclear . Therefore , investigator plan conduct first randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study design explore possible mechanisms action inhale fentanyl activity-related dyspnea exercise performance patient advance COPD .</brief_summary>
