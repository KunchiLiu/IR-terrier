	<brief_summary>ABSTRACT Background : It well recognize excess dietary salt intake play major role development hypertension . Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) associate excess salt water retention ( excess volume ) associate hypertension . Hypotheses : Hypothesis 1 : Dietary salt restriction improve volume status subject CKD stag 3-4 assessed Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis ( BIA ) . Hypothesis 2 : Dietary salt restriction result improve blood pressure control patient CKD stag 3-4 . Hypothesis 3 : Dietary salt restriction decrease albuminuria patient CKD stag 3-4 . Patients Trial Design : This randomize crossover pilot study design assess effect salt restriction volume status patient CKD stag 3 4 . Subjects randomize treatment order : ( 1 ) 4 week salt restriction &lt; 85 mmol sodium per day , 2 week washout period , 4 week usual salt diet , OR ( 2 ) 4 week usual diet , 2 week washout , 4 week salt restriction . Patients receive dietary counsel person study visit weekly interval phone call study dietician . At week 0 , 4 , 6 10 , patient undergo assessment ( ) physical examination assessment weight , blood pressure , pulse , anthropometrics standardize clinical assessment volume status . ( ii ) volume status use bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) ( iii ) 24-hour urine testing , albumin , creatinine aldosterone Every 2 week throughout study , 24-hour urine sodium measure compliance , serum electrolyte assess safety . Data Analysis : BIA measurement low salt group compare regular diet group use standard linear model analysis 2x2 crossover trial . Additionally , 24-hour ambulatory static blood pressure 24-hour urine aldosterone level compare two group . Future Implications : A significant reduction degree volume expansion ( assess BIA ) blood pressure result salt restrict diet would implications renal cardiovascular protection would warrant confirmation large randomize trial .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Individuals eligible participate study must meet following criterion : Willing able provide write , sign informed consent nature study explain , prior researchrelated procedure . Age ≥ 18 year ≤ 85 year . Willing able comply study procedure . Patients eGFR 20 60 ml/min/173m2 abbreviate ( 4variable ) MDRD equation relatively stable clinical course . Sitting systolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg prior study entry ( exclude people risk hypotension dietary salt reduction ) . Individuals meet follow exclusion criterion eligible participate study : Recent acute illness ( ≤1 month ) . Minor ailment recover common cold allergic rhinitis would consider exclusion criterion would leave site PI 's discretion . Recent hospitalization ( ≤1 month ) unless clearly minor elective procedure unlikely interfere BIA measurement . The final decision leave site PI 's discretion . Any psychological condition ( include alcoholism ) could interfere patient 's ability comply study protocol . Subjects baseline 24hour urinary sodium excretion ≤100 mmol/day . Amputation limb finger toe . Pacemaker , defibrillator , implantable pump , artificial joint , pin , plat type metal object body ( dental filling ) . Coronary stent metal suture material heart . Use investigational product investigational medical device within 30 day prior screen , requirement investigational agent prior completion schedule study assessment . Weight 300 pound ( limitation examination table ) . Pregnancy lactation . Patients kidney disease know associated salt wasting ( see ) . Patients atrial fibrillation ambulatory blood pressure measurement may accurate set . Any condition , view PI , place subject high risk poor treatment compliance complete study .</criteria>
