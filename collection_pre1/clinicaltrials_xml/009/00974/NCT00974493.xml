	<brief_title>Oral Versus Intravenous Antibiotics Bone Joint Infections ( OVIVA B &amp; J )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A long course antibiotic therapy give `` drip '' ( i.e . intravenous ) recommend treatment many serious bacterial infection . It costly inconvenient patient remain hospitalised therapy , outpatient antibiotic therapy ( OPAT ) programmes establish many country deliver intravenous antibiotic safely conveniently . The majority patient refer OPAT programme bone joint infection . However , clear evidence bone joint infection really require long course intravenous antibiotic rather oral antibiotic . We compare outcome treatment intravenous versus oral antibiotic therapy patient bone joint infection . The choice antibiotic complex , antibiotic suitable oral choice often suitable intravenous choice vice versa . Subjects therefore randomize oral intravenous `` strategy , '' rather individual antibiotic . Outcomes determine pre-established objective criterion treatment failure . We conduct pilot study one centre ( Oxford ) , recruit approximately 200 patient , expand include multi-centre recruitment UK , aim recruit 1050 patient .</detailed_description>
