	<brief_summary>Quality life heart health intimately connect childhood physical activity participation ( PAP ) . Physical activity critical childhood growth , development , learning , socialization , quality life essential component life-long heart health . Research investigator study others show low PAP level common among child heart defect , sedentary lifestyle relate exercise capacity , medical status heart function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Therefore , hypothesize psychosocial factor important determinant PAP population . Our recent research child univentricular heart indicate gross motor skill psychosocial factor significant correlate PAP . Important psychosocial factor include self-efficacy activity , uncertainty activity , inaccurate perception child 's PAP level , option , ability . This study seek determine whether gross motor skill psychosocial factor influence PAP among child broad spectrum cardiac defect . It also determine optimal change clinical care need encourage child heart defect develop health-related active lifestyle . We propose prospective , randomize , cross-over preliminary clinical trial utilize quantitative qualitative assessment . Through cross-over design , subject complete intervention ( information , demonstration ) , order intervention delivery randomly determine . Quantitative assessment document moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) , gross motor skill , health-related fitness . Qualitative assessment evaluate parent/child anxiety PAP psychosocial factor influence PAP . All factor assess data collection point .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Successful repair one follow congenital heart defect : transcatheter device closure atrial septal defect ( ASD ) , arterial switch repair transposition great artery ( TGA ) , surgical repair tetralogy Fallot ( TOF ) , Fontan procedure functionally univentricular heart ( UVH ) . At least one year recent open heart surgery . 4 11 year age attend elementary school first study visit . Identification exercise contraindications/limitations responsible cardiologist . Other disability medical condition may influence PAP . Children achieve 90 minute MVPA 5 day per week baseline assessment exclude intervention phase . The study intervention design increase MVPA among child already achieve Health Canada guideline PAP .</criteria>
