	<brief_summary>The main purpose study test safety new vaccine , STEBVax , may lead useful treatment toxic shock syndrome . The second purpose determine whether STEBVax cause body produce antibody ( protein fight infection ) help body resist disease . Researchers expect STEBVax shot cause development antibody blood . Study participant include 42 healthy adult , age 18-40 , University Maryland Baltimore community . Participants assign one 7 vaccine dose group . Assignment dosage group depend individual enrol study . Study procedure include blood sampling , urine collection , physical examination . Subjects maintain memory aid document daily oral temperature possible vaccine side effect . Participants involve study related procedure 201 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I STEBVax Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase I study safety immunogenicity recombinant Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B vaccine ( STEBVax ) healthy adult . STEBVax recombinant mutate form staphylococcal enterotoxin B ( SEB ) contain three point mutation disrupt interaction toxin human major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II receptor render protein non-toxic retaining immunogenicity . The primary intend result program development hyperimmune serum treatment toxic shock syndrome ( TSS ) originate nosocomial , environmental potential bioterrorist event . An additional long-term goal development multivalent vaccine immunotherapeutic treat preventing disease cause Staphylococcus ( S. ) aureus . The long-range goal develop vaccine protect broad range staphylococcal superantigens . The primary objective evaluate ass safety parenterally administer STEBVax vaccine healthy adult subject range dose 0.01 20 mcg intramuscular injection . The secondary objective determine immunogenicity STEBVax vaccine range dos determine rate titer seroconversion serum anti-S. aureus enterotoxin B IgG antibody measure enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay ( ELISA ) . Participants include 28 healthy adult subject University Maryland Baltimore community . Subjects receive dose STEBVax Alhydrogel adjuvant one follow dos : 0.01 , 0.1 , 0.5 , 2.5 , 10 20 mcg 2 dose 20 mcg give 21 day apart . STEBVax administer single 0.5 mL intramuscular injection . Subjects follow safety , reactogenicity , immune response vaccination . Subjects observed clinic least 8 hour vaccination remain Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area 7 day vaccination .</detailed_description>
