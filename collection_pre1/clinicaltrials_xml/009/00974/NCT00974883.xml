	<brief_summary>Giant Cell Arteritis ( GCA ) cause inflammation narrow blood vessel cause blindness one third patient . It important prompt , accurate diagnosis GCA make treatment give steroid two year . Currently 100 % accurate test GCA . Patients usually new headache scalp tenderness , typically abnormal blood test . However , difficult distinguish non-serious form headache GCA ; infection produce similar abnormal blood result . If suspicion GCA , treatment steroid start straight away . To confirm diagnosis , patient need biopsy temporal artery ( minor procedure perform local anaesthetic remove sample one scalp artery ) . However , 44 % patient normal biopsy . Therefore difficult know patient normal biopsy GCA . Withdrawing steroid treatment may increase risk blindness . Continuing treatment patient without GCA increase risk side effect ( e.g. , weight gain , infection risk , osteoporosis fracture risk , high blood pressure , diabetes , cataract ) . It important improve diagnostic test GCA . Another test help diagnose GCA ultrasound scan artery side head arm . Ultrasound involve surgery ; simple test perform patient . Gel apply side head arm . A sound probe place artery site produce scan . The investigator ' study examine role ultrasound diagnosis 402 patient suspected GCA . All patient ultrasound examination addition biopsy within week start steroid . Patients treat accord usual practice . After six month , investigator reassess diagnosis . The investigator look accuracy ultrasound compare combined biopsy . The investigator look doctor 's knowledge ultrasound result biopsy result alone would affect diagnosis recommendation continue stop steroid treatment . The investigator assess whether knowledge result together would alter diagnosis treatment . The investigator collect information estimate cost different way diagnose GCA relation impact quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OVERALL DESIGN : The overall design consist cohort study 402 participant suspect GCA follow 6 month ; cost-effectiveness study compare ultrasound temporal artery biopsy ; study observer agreement evaluate ultrasound temporal artery biopsy ; expert panel assess appropriateness alternative strategy diagnose treat patient suspect GCA . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . To evaluate diagnostic accuracy ( sensitivity specificity ) ultrasound alternative temporal artery biopsy diagnosis GCA patient refer biopsy suspect GCA . 2 . To evaluate cost-effectiveness ( incremental cost per QALY ) ultrasound instead biopsy diagnosis GCA . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : 3 . To evaluate inter-observer agreement assessment ultrasound temporal artery biopsy . 4 . To elicit expert view appropriateness perform biopsy follow ultrasound use clinical vignette . 5 . To evaluate diagnostic accuracy ( sensitivity specificity ) sequential diagnostic strategy 4 alternative temporal artery biopsy alone diagnosis GCA . 6 . To evaluate cost-effectiveness ( incremental cost per QALY ) diagnostic strategy 4 instead biopsy alone diagnosis GCA . DESIGN : A prospective cohort study evaluate impact ultrasound biopsy temporal artery diagnosis GCA treatment decision . The cohort study use pair design , i.e . participant US biopsy , diagnostic performance assess composite reference standard diagnosis follow final ( 6 month ) assessment . To evaluate impact US/biopsy result clinical practice long term outcome , derive clinical vignette base case recruit study , present treat clinician , along either ultrasound , biopsy result , indicate diagnosis propose treatment . The main cost-effectiveness analysis evaluate incremental cost per quality adjust life year ( QALY ) long term ( lifetime ) horizon diagnostic strategy . SETTING : Outpatient inpatient rheumatology ophthalmology department 25 National Health Service ( NHS ) trust United Kingdom ( UK ) ( also sit Europe require ) access high resolution US . TARGET POPULATION : Patients suspect GCA would normally require urgent temporal artery biopsy , i.e . referral primary care suspect GCA identify secondary care . Recruitment participant restrict patient US biopsy perform within 7 day start high-dose steroid . HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES BEING ASSESSED : Halo , stenosis , occlusion assess high resolution US ; presence giant cell granulomatous inflammation temporal artery biopsy . MEASUREMENT OF COST AND OUTCOMES : Data collection baseline , 2 week 6 month include clinical laboratory marker disease activity , resource use , health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) use EuroQol-5D ( EQ-5D ) , adverse event . Baseline assessment include retrospective assessment symptom erythrocyte sedimentation rate/C-reactive protein ( ESR/CRP ) result start steroid . The reference standard diagnosis make use composite American College Rheumatology classification criterion , GCA-related event , alternative diagnosis use data collect assessment . Proposed treatment data collect participate clinician test result release , classified treatment GCA ( e.g . initiate/continue steroid ) GCA ( e.g . withdraw/rapid taper steroid ) compare change propose treatment evaluate agreement reference diagnosis . Unit cost resource use obtain nationally publish source available . Modelling estimate impact diagnostic strategy clinical outcome ( e.g . GCA complication steroid related adverse event ) , cost impact HRQoL beyond study follow-up within study follow-up . Probabilities event , cost impact obtain study data , systematic literature review , absence relevant data , formal elicitation expert opinion . Costs benefit discount 3.5 % ( National Institute Health Care Excellence [ NICE ] guidance ) uncertainty ( include model assumption ) subject probabilistic sensitivity analysis scenario analysis . SAMPLE SIZE : A sample size 402 patient provide 90 % power 5 % type I error rate test joint hypothesis ( ) US great sensitivity biopsy ( detect increase sensitivity 76 % biopsy ( assume 0.24 false negative fraction base 9-44 % biopsy-negative GCA ) 87 % sensitivity US ; ( ii ) detect specificity US le 0.83 base expect specificity 0.96 . This sample size allow estimation one-sided rectangular confidence region US false true positive fraction , assume 80 % prevalence GCA patient biopsy suspect GCA , sample size inflate ( gamma=0.1 ) due uncertainty proportion cases/controls cohort design . We actually recruit 430 case allow possible drop-outs study . In addition recruit 270 individual train purpose , allow centre learn technique temporal artery axillary artery scanning . Each centre collect 10 individual ( train case ) , similar age gender study cohort , temporal arteritis . This important order ensure observer trained recognise appearance see normal ( non GCA artery ) especially patient atherosclerosis . Further ultrasound train include video exam ( identify image normal abnormal feature GCA ) 'hot ' case assessment ( scan patient GCA ) design ultrasound training programme . In addition , provide adequate training day ( e.g . 2 separate training day ) observer train formally Dr Schmidt ultrasound expert ensure adequate observer agreement . The first training day hold prior start recruitment patient , repeat first year . PROJECT TIMETABLE : Total : 48 month ( UPDATED TO 60 MONTHS SEE BELOW ) Month 1-6 Study materials/protocols prepare ; Ethics research governance approval complete ; Centres train , approve ready recruit . Month 7-12 Recruitment monitoring report ; Quality control report . Month 13-18 Recruitment monitoring report ; Quality control report ; Additional centre ( require ) train , approve ready recruit ; Month 19-24 Recruitment monitor report ; Quality control report . Month 25-30 Recruitment monitoring report ; Quality control report ; Web-based US biopsy assessment develop . Month 31-36 Recruitment complete ; Clinical vignette ( web-based ) develop . Month 37-42 Follow-up complete ; Inter-rater assessment US biopsy image analysis compete ; Expert panel review vignette complete . Month 43-48 Database clean lock ; Analysis complete ; statistical analysis economic modelling , report draft preparation paper . Final report complete . PLEASE NOTE : 12 MONTH EXTENSION WAS GRANTED BY THE FUNDER ( NIHR HTA ) IN SEPTEMBER 2012 TO EXTEND THE RECRUITMENT PERIOD FROM THE END OF DECEMBER 2012 TO END OF DECEMBER 2013 ( A FURTHER 12 MONTHS ) . TH END OF STUDY WILL NOW BE DECEMBER 2014 The study overseen Trial Steering Committee ( TSC ) independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) least 1 meeting per year . BIOBANK : We develop biobank tissue , serum , DNA ultrasound video image blood vessel GCA . An important benefit primary protocol use accumulate material number related project .</detailed_description>
