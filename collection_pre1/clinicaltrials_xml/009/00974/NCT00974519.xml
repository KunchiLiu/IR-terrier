	<brief_summary>Immunity 1 ( Fuzheng 1 ) compose herbs tonic detoxific function . The long-term clinical application prove safety effect . It improve symptom sign AIDS patient effective rate 70 % significantly improve quality life . It also improve stabilize immune function inhibit viral replication . The basis study show Immunity 1 ( Fuzheng 1 ) inhibit viral replication multi-target , multi-link , enhance immune function , increase secretion IL-2 , IFN-γ , participate immune regulation effect , enhance NK cell activity , promote CD3+CD4+T cell proliferation increase macrophage phagocytes capacity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Combination Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) Immune Reconstitution HIV/AIDS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Meng Kun find Joint application Chuankezhi enhance number CD4 cell reduce side-effects HAART compare HAART alone . order verify long-term efficacy combination therapy , carry clinical observation three case patient receive combination therapy period 3 year , observation three case patient , find CD3+CD4+T lymphocyte count significantly increase HIV-RNA viral load 50copies long-term , without occurrence drug resistance . And patient 's symptom sign also significantly improve . - Duan Cheng Yu analyse 334 case AIDS patient ' clinical symptom , sign Karnofsky score , CD3+CD4+ T lymphocyte count treatment . The patient take `` kang ai bao sheng '' capsule 3 month . The result show 334 case patient receive traditional Chinese western medicine treatment show improvement symptom sign , increase CD3+CD4+ T lymphocyte count . They propose combination traditional Chinese western medicine improve symptom , enhance immunity function improve quality life AIDS patient . - In order observe effect combination TCM HAART HIV/AIDS patient , ZHANG Ai-min divide 63 case AIDS 3 group . 20 case receive TCM treatment 22 case receive combination TCM HAART , 21 case receive western medicine . The patient ' symptom , sign , Karnofsky score point , CD3+CD4+T lymphocyte count HIV-RNA viral load record compare difference 3 group . The result show combination treatment effectively improve immune function HIV/AIDS patient , reduce HIV-RNA viral load , improve patient ' symptom , sign quality life . - Immunity 1 ( Fuzheng 1 ) compose herbs tonic detoxific function . The long-term clinical application prove safety effect . It improve symptom sign AIDS patient effective rate 70 % significantly improve quality life . It also improve stabilize immune function inhibit viral replication . The basis study show Immunity 1 ( Fuzheng 1 ) inhibit viral replication multi-target , multi-link , enhance immune function , increase secretion IL-2 , IFN-γ , participate immune regulation effect , enhance NK cell activity , promote CD3+CD4+T cell proliferation increase macrophage phagocytes capacity . - Through clinical trial , go evaluate efficacy safety combination TCM HAART immune reconstitution HIV/AIDS patient .</detailed_description>
