	<brief_summary>Subjects normal kidney function able excrete urine calcium phosphorus absorb via gastrointestinal tract thereby able maintain calcium phosphorus balance . Patients chronic kidney disease often normal blood level calcium phosphorus research conduct determine able excrete daily intake mineral . If able excrete daily intake , mineral could deposit soft tissue blood vessel contribute increase risk cardiovascular disease see patient chronic kidney disease . This study determine subject chronic kidney disease balance primarily regard calcium level kidney function longer able maintain balance . Understanding whether patient chronic kidney disease balance help direct future therapeutic intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Calcium Balance Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) late Stage 3 Stage 4 patient longer able maintain calcium balance excrete daily intake calcium . We also hypothesize retention calcium reflect serum concentration , body attempt maintain serum calcium concentration within narrow limit . We evaluate balance two different level calcium intake . The two different level choose extremes normal calcium intake provide insight balance low normal high normal load . Specific expect experimental finding : Directional Hypotheses : Primary Hypothesis : Late Stage 3/Stage 4 CKD patient ( Estimated glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] 15-40 ml/min/m2 ) excrete 20 % absorbed calcium high calcium ( 2000 mg ) diet . On low calcium ( 800 mg ) diet , CKD stage 4 patient excrete 50 % absorbed calcium . Gastrointestinal absorption 20 % diet result net positive calcium balance 320 mg high calcium intake 80 mg low calcium intake . Subjects normal kidney function ( eGRF &gt; 60 ml/min/m2 ) excrete &gt; 90 % absorbed calcium high calcium diet &gt; 90 % absorbed calcium low calcium diet . Gastrointestinal absorption 20 % diet result net positive calcium balance high calcium intake low calcium intake . Secondary Hypothesis : Late Stage 3/Stage 4 CKD patient ( eGFR 15-40 ml/min/m2 ) excrete 60 % absorb phosphorus 1600 mg phosphate diet . Normal subject ( eGRF &gt; 60 ml/min/m2 ) expect excrete &gt; 90 % absorb phosphorus 1600 mg phosphate diet . Gastrointestinal phosphate absorption expect 60 % diet result net positive phosphorus balance 192 mg 384 mg late stage 3/stage 4 CKD respectively . In addition , hypothesize decrease fractional excretion absorb phosphorus eGFR decrease . The goal study follow group patient : 1 . Late Stage 3/Stage 4 CKD ( eGFR 15-40 ml/min/m² ) 2 . Normal subject ( eGFR &gt; 60 ml/min/m² ) Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) calculate four variable Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) equation include serum creatinine , patient ' age , gender ethnicity . Subjects CKD recruit clinical practice nephrology division University Colorado Health Sciences Center ( HSC ) nephrologists screen stable CKD base historical laboratory data . Following informed consent prior start study , patient evaluate determine whether vitamin D replete . Vitamin D deficiency common elderly chronically ill , also young healthy adult , especially end winter . In study young healthy adult , age 18 29 , 36 % 69 subject find dihydroxy-vitamin D ( Vitamin D 25-OH ) deficient end winter compare 4 % end summer ( 13 ) . For reason , patient assess Vitamin D 25-OH repletion prior initiate study diet . This accomplish check serum Vitamin D 25-OH level patient . Those Vitamin D 25-OH level less 30 ng/mL receive ergocalciferol 50,000 IU per week x 4 week . This Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative ( KDOQI ) guideline recommendation patient CKD vitamin deficient . After time , Vitamin D 25-OH level check ass whether replete ( i.e. , serum level &gt; 30 ng/mL ) . If serum level 30 ng/mL , second 4 week course ergocalciferol give . If patient 's serum Vitamin D 25-OH level remain &lt; 30 ng/mL exclude study . Once replete , subject remain 50,000 IU ergocalciferol monthly throughout study . This ensure vitamin D substrate limit factor patient . In addition follow medication discontinue follow informed consent least 1 month prior start first control diet , duration study : paricalcitol , doxercalciferol , rocaltrol , cinacalcet , calcium supplement include calcium containing vitamin , phosphate binder . Once patient vitamin D replete calcium phosphorus determine exclude study phosphorus exceed 4.5 mg/dL calcium outside normal range . Patients place two diet random order 9 day . Randomization diet accomplish use Permuted block stratify CKD stage . Patients receive one two diet 9 day period , subsequently go second diet least one week `` washout period '' . This wash-out period may last 4 week accommodate patient 's schedule study menstruate woman phase cycle . Both patient researcher blind diet patient receive . The last two day study period , patient admit GCRC collect two consecutive 24 hour urine calcium , phosphorus , sodium , creatinine , well stool sample ( see ) calcium phosphorus . The stool analysis calcium phosphorus use determine amount ingest calcium phosphorus absorb diet ( fractional absorption ) , urinary calcium phosphorus use determine fraction absorb mineral excreted urine . The urine sodium use ensure stable dietary intake urinary creatinine use ensure urine collection complete determine tubular reabsorption phosphorus . A non-absorbable stool marker ( Brilliant Blue ) administer patient even admission GCRC second evening order demarcate time period stool collect form . If patient pass second marker end 48 hour period , ask collect stool home bring back General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) . On final day patient ' GCRC admission , collection second 24 hour urine sample complete , final small urine collection obtain . This last urine sample use measure spot calcium phosphorus concentration order compare value know amount excrete two previous 24 hour collection . Patients also small saliva sample , approximately 3 mL , collect GCRC admission use measure salivary phosphorus concentration . These saliva sample store GCRC laboratory identify perform testing . Patients also overnight fast serum calcium , phosphorus , creatinine , 1,25 vitamin D , 25 vitamin D , intact Parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) 23 level measure completion 24 hour urine collection . In addition , patient serum phosphorus determination prior even meal evening GCRC stay . After `` wash-out '' period least one week patient start second week-long diet , end admit GCRC two day period . Patients may schedule second diet period GCRC stay within one four week previous diet GCRC stay convenience . The diet prepare GCRC nutrition staff . Diet # 1 ( high-calcium diet ) : Elemental calcium 2000 mg , phosphorus 1600 mg Diet # 2 ( low-calcium diet ) : Elemental calcium 800 mg , phosphorus 1600 mg The diet sodium potassium concentration , diabetic 2000 kilocalorie ( kCal ) / day diet . As goal study focus calcium balance , affect energy balance , adjustment individual negative positive energy balance . During stay GCRC subject drink deionized water beverage whose calcium phosphorus content include assessment dietary calcium intake . All study subject counsel eat food prepare study protocol . They also counsel attempt eat food provide . They instruct bring food consume . They also ask keep diet history food eat prepare diet . No supplemental vitamin , calcium , vitamin D , phosphate binder take study period .</detailed_description>
