	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Radiation therapy may effective treat malignant spinal cord compression patient receive previous radiation therapy spine . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study radiation therapy treat patient malignant spinal cord compression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine efficacy biologically effective dose-based re-irradiation strategy , term response rate ( base mobility score use Tomita scale improvement mobility stable mobility score regard response ) patient malignant spinal cord compression . Secondary - To determine quality life assess EORTC QLQ-C15 PAL version 1.0 questionnaire . - To determine non-spinal radiation-induced toxicity use standard RTOG criterion . - To determine rate long-term spinal toxicity radiation-induced myelopathy use RTOG SOMA morbidity grade system . OUTLINE : Patients divide 2 group accord interval since recent radiotherapy involve area spinal cord . - Group 1 ( &lt; 6 month since prior radiotherapy ) : Patients undergo radiotherapy cumulative biologically effective dose ( BED ) ≤ 100 Gy_2 addition receive current treatment . - Group 2 ( ≥ 6 month since prior radiotherapy ) : Patients undergo radiotherapy cumulative BED ≤ 130 Gy_2 addition receive current treatment . Mobility score assess patient complete quality-of-life assessment baseline follow-up visit start week 5 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 5 week , 3 month , every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
