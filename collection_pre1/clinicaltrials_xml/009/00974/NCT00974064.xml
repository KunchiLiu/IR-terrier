	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoke major risk factor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD , commonly know chronic bronchitis emphysema ) . Despite clear link , 15-20 % smoker develop COPD suggest genetic factor affect lung 's susceptibility stress cigarette smoke . The cell line airway ( epithelium ) cell help defend lung ( alveolar macrophage ) smoker develop gene expression change different nonsmoker . In investigator ' previous study demonstrate great 200 gene responsive cigarette smoke cell . But investigator know whether gene expression static change function time . Genes show significant change time may relevant progression disease . Even though quit smoke reduces rate lung decline , many-smokers still go develop COPD . This study provide insight natural history smoking-related gene expression lung cell health disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cigarette smoke responsible majority lung cancer major cause COPD , fourth lead cause death United States . Despite well establish causal role cigarette smoke lung cancer COPD , 10-20 % smoker actually develop disease . This suggest genetic predisposing factor place individual great risk . Our prior work show healthy smoker ( cigarette smoker normal history , physical exam , lung function test chest x-ray ) smoker COPD mark regulation great 200 gene small airway epithelium alveolar macrophage . There however , varied response smoking among individual , individual abnormally express far few gene . The focus study evaluate hypothesis response lung cell stress smoking unique individual consistent time . Furthermore , individual stop smoke unique response , constant time individual . By define pattern biologic response time among smoke , ex-smoking nonsmoking subject , able identify common biologic pathways potential target intervention .</detailed_description>
