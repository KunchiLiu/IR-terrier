Studies show topical tretinoin increase collagen synthesis epidermal thickness thereby improve appearance skin age . The efficacy Rejuva combine another topical cosmetic cream Redermic treatment skin age unknown . One hundred twenty ( 120 ) subject sign skin age participate single-blind study evaluate efficacy tolerance Redermic versus Rejuva-A™ ( 0.025 % tretinoin ) Redermic combination Rejuva-A™ ( 0.025 % tretinoin ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Facial skin age complex multifactorial process combine extrinsic intrinsic factor . Major extrinsic factor include sun exposure smoking intrinsic factor believe genetically program . Changes dermis responsible many important clinical change associate skin age . With age decrease number fibroblast decrease ability synthesize collagen result decrease collagen I II . This coupled increase matrix metalloproteinases activity . Skin biopsies elderly volunteer show change collagen bundle become fragmented disorganized well elastin fiber decrease . Changes also occur epidermis include decrease epidermal thickness change morphology keratinocytes basal layer . Clinically change result skin atrophy , increase skin laxity , wrinkle , sag , yellowness change pigmentation . Redermic cosmetic cream contain vitamin C madecassoside . A preliminary 20 subject split face study show product well tolerate could improve sign skin age . To evaluate change skin age study use clinical evaluation face , skin hydration , fringe technique , skin biopsy skin elasticity measurement . The investigator perform transepidermal water loss ( TEWL ) , facial skin evaluation use photonumeric guideline , evaluation photoaging panel blind dermatologist skin replica evaluation . There data combination Redermic tretinoin safety efficacy Redermic compare topical tretinoin . Rejuva cream currently approve Health Canada treatment photodamaged skin . It contain 0.025 % tretinoin one widely studied topical product skin age . Studies show topical tretinoin increase collagen synthesis epidermal thickness thereby improve appearance skin age . The efficacy Rejuva combine another topical cosmetic cream Redermic treatment skin age unknown . The main objective single-blind study assess efficacy anti age effect tolerance Redermic alone compare Rejuva-A™ ( 0.025 % tretinoin ) alone combination Rejuva-A™ ( 0.025 % tretinoin ) . One hundred twenty ( 120 ) subject sign skin age participate single-blind study evaluate efficacy tolerance Redermic versus Rejuva-A™ ( 0.025 % tretinoin ) Redermic combination Rejuva-A™ ( 0.025 % tretinoin ) . Subjects randomize ( 1:1:1 ) three group forty ( 40 ) , ask apply study product face ( except eyelid , nostrils mucous membrane ) 24 week .</detailed_description>
