	<detailed_description>- The average period asymptomatic HIV-infection 8 year , stage , CD4+ T lymphocyte count reduce gradually rate 50~100cells/ul/year . When CD4 T lymphocyte count drop 350cells/ul viral load increase 105 AIDS patient , HAART carry . But , CD4 T lymphocyte 350~550 cells/ul , intervention measure . - Immunity 1 ( Fuzheng 1 ) compose herbs tonic detoxific function . The long-term clinical application prove safety effect . It improve symptom sign AIDS patient effective rate 70 % significantly improve quality life . It also improve stabilize immune function inhibit viral replication . The basis study show Immunity 1 ( Fuzheng 1 ) inhibit viral replication multi-target , multi-link , enhance immune function , increase secretion IL-2 , IFN-γ , participate immune regulation effect , enhance NK cell activity , promote CD3+CD4+T cell proliferation increase macrophage phagocytes capacity . - Through clinical trial , go evaluate efficacy safety Immunity 1 ( Fuzheng 1 ) immune reconstitution HIV patient WHOⅠ、II period .</detailed_description>
