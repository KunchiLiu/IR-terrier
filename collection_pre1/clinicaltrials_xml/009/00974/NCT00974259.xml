	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) major cause death disability , estimate cost 45 billion dollar year United States alone . Every year , approximately 1.4 million sustain TBI , 50,000 people die , another 235,000 hospitalize survive injury . As result , 80,000-90,000 people experience permanent disability associate TBI . This project design determine whether device design measure brain tissue oxygenation thus detect brain ischemia still potentially treatable show promise reduce duration brain ischemia , obtain information require conduct definitive clinical trial efficacy . A recently approve device make feasible directly continuously monitor partial pressure oxygen brain tissue ( pBrO2 ) . Several observational study indicate episode low pBrO2 common associate poor outcome , medical intervention effective improve pBrO2 clinical practice . However , randomize control trial carry determine whether pBrO2 monitoring result improve outcome severe TBI , use technology far widely adopt neurosurgical intensive care unit ( ICUs ) . This study first randomize , control clinical trial pBrO2 monitoring , design obtain data require definitive phase III study , efficacy physiologic maneuver aim treat pBrO2 , feasibility standardize complex intensive care unit management protocol across multiple clinical site . Patients severe TBI monitor Intracranial pressure monitoring ( ICP ) pBrO2 monitoring , randomize therapy base ICP along ( control group ) therapy base ICP addition pBrO2 value ( treatment group ) . 182 participant enrol four clinical site , University Texas Southwestern Medical Center/Parkland Memorial Hospital , University Washington/Harborview Medical Center , University Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital , University Pennsylvania/Hospital University Pennsylvania . Functional outcome assess 6-months injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design Outcomes This study two-arm , single-blind , randomize , control , phase II , multi-center pilot trial efficacy pBrO2 monitoring , design obtain data require definitive phase III study , efficacy physiologic maneuver aim normalizing pBrO2 . 182 patient severe TBI require ICP monitoring recruit study 4 clinical site US ( Univ . Texas Southwestern/Parkland Memorial Hospital , Univ . Washington/Harborview Medical Center , Univ . Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital , Univ . Pennsylvania/Hospital Univ . Pennsylvania ) . All patient ICP monitor pBrO2 monitor insert burr hole . Half patient randomize treatment protocol base ICP pBrO2 reading , control group randomize treatment protocol base ICP reading . The pBrO2monitors control arm mask , treat physician unaware pBrO2 information . Patients telephone follow-up interview ass level recovery 6 month post injury , use Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended . Interventions Duration Patients randomize control group pBrO2 implant similar fashion patient treatment group , calibration device , display cover opaque tape . Patients control treat protocol base ICP measure . Patients treatment group ( ICP pBrO2 measure visible ) treat accord protocol incorporates ICP pBrO2 measure . The treatment protocol base current standard care , describe detail insure uniformity treatment across 4 study site . The probe remain place maximum 5 day , value normal 48 hour , sooner complication arises . If patient normal value , monitor remove 48 hour . Objectives Primary Objective : The prescribed treatment protocol , base pBrO2 monitoring , result reduction fraction time brain oxygen level critical threshold 20 mm Hg patient severe traumatic brain injury . Secondary Objectives : - Safety hypothesis : Adverse event associate pBrO2 monitoring rare . - Feasibility hypothesis : Episodes decrease pBrO2 identify treatment protocol institute comparably across 4 clinical site , protocol violation low ( &lt; 10 % ) uniform across different clinical site . - Non-futility hypothesis : A relative risk good outcome measure Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended 6 month injury 2.0 consistent result phase II study .</detailed_description>
