	<brief_title>A Study REOLYSIN® Combination With Paclitaxel Carboplatin Patients With Squamous Cell Carcinoma Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer remain common cancer cause cancer-related mortality United States . In 2008 , estimate 215,000 new case lung cancer diagnose roughly 162,000 death lung cancer ( NCI 2009 ) . The majority ( 85 % ) patient diagnosis lung cancer non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The combination paclitaxel carboplatin become commonly prescribed chemotherapy regimen treatment advance NSCLC United States . Laboratory study combination REOLYSIN variety chemotherapeutic agent show combination REOLYSIN paclitaxel invariably synergistic , even cell drug resistance limited sensitivity reovirus . Moreover , reovirus activity dramatically increase presence taxane . The Phase 2 study design characterize efficacy safety REOLYSIN give intravenously combination paclitaxel carboplatin every 3 week patient squamous cell carinoma lung . Response primary endpoint trial . The safety treatment combination assess evaluation type , frequency severity adverse event , change clinical laboratory test , immunogenicity physical examination . Patients may continue receive chemotherapy combine REOLYSIN 8 cycle may continue indefinitely REOLYSIN monotherapy protocol , provide experience either progressive disease unacceptable drug-related toxicity respond either supportive care dose reduction .</detailed_description>
