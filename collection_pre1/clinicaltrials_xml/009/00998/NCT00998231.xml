	<detailed_description>Rational : Major Depressive Episode ( MDE ) affect nearly 15 % general population . To date , pathophysiology remain unclear treatment effect often inconsistent . Therefore , challenge make valid prognosis depression identification biomarkers important way improve patient 's treatment . Messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) could potential biological marker . Several study show quantitative variation peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) MDE . These variation state dependent and/or correlate clinical measure . In preliminary study , investigator identify 12 gene whose expression either alter patient control sample and/or first patient sample sample patient obtain 8 week later . However , study assess evolution alteration beyond 8 week window 2 time point consider . Objective : investigator aim compare gene expression difference 21 candidate gene , 12 already investigate , 2 group subject . MDE control sample analyze across large time window draw good picture complex progression MDE . Population method : This study longitudinal comparative . 20 subject per group include follow 6 month interval include 4 visit ( inclusion , 2 8 week later finally 6 month later ) . Clinical observation psychometric scale use evaluation . Blood collection PBMCs extraction operate evaluation follow RNA extraction , reverse transcription gene expression quantification real-time PCR . Expected result : mRNA either under-expressed patient MDE correlation clinical state . There variation across time control subject . Comparison MDE control show difference MDE clinical remission .</detailed_description>
