	<brief_title>Patterns Non-Adherence Dual Anti-Platelet Regimen In Stented Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anti-platelet medicine cornerstone therapy patient present acute coronary syndrome , include unstable angina , non-ST elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) , ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . Multiple clinical trial demonstrate efficacy dual anti-platelet therapy ( DAPT ) prevention thrombotic event patient present unstable coronary symptom ; particular , patient receive percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Dual anti-platelet therapy consist combination aspirin thienopyridine ( clopidogrel ticlopidine ) . While premature discontinuation ( within first 6 month ) therapy associate increase risk stent thrombosis , optimal duration DAPT yet precisely determine . Although study suggest increase risk stent thrombosis adverse event within day thienopyridine discontinuation , study collect detailed data exact date reason anti-platelet agent discontinue - thus , true risk premature early even schedule late discontinuation unknown . Furthermore , multiple mode impact subject adherence DAPT . These include non-compliance cost issue . We determine three mode subject may adhere DAPT . These include : - Discontinuation - These subject discontinue use DAPT ( aspirin thienopyridines ) per recommendation physician felt subject long need therapy . - Interruption - These subject interrupt DAPT use voluntary basis guidance recommendation physician due need surgical procedure , reinstitute use DAPT within 14 day stop therapy . Interruptions must guide physician/cardiologist take care subject health care professional . - Disruption - These subject disrupt DAPT use , either bleed episode ( minor major ) non-compliance . Non-compliance include continue use DAPT low dose level prescribe either small daily dos less frequent daily use . These mode previously systematically collect correlated adverse clinical event stent thrombosis . Furthermore , relation event subsequent disruption DAPT study prospectively . Subjects enrol registry follow approximately 24 month determine incidence adherence accord classification . All patient event DAPT use monitor follow-up period . The assumption subject discontinue therapy voluntarily ( usually accord physician 's advice ) disrupt therapy risk major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) . This registry examine predictor DAPT disruption base subject 's demographic determine relationship bleed versus MI subject use time-dependent covariate adjust analysis . Finally , since two completely different category within disrupt group , ( non-compliance vs. event drive disruption ) , examine patient separately well , secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
