	<brief_title>Patient Comfort With Vascular Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The traditional , standard technique achieve femoral artery hemostasis follow diagnostic interventional catheterization procedure require compression method manual pressure clamp hold puncture site 10 30 minute , even longer depend sheath size anticoagulation status . This traditional method associate patient discomfort well prolong bed rest , ambulation hospital discharge . Over past decade , Vascular Closure Devices ( VCDs ) , include collagen hemostasis device , percutaneous suture-mediated closure device metallic clip , emerge novel mean reduce time hemostasis ambulation follow catheterization procedure perform utilizing femoral arterial access . Previous study commercially available VCDs show reduction time hemostasis time ambulation discharge also lead increased patient satisfaction manual compression . The MynxM5 Vascular Closure Device receive FDA approval April 8 , 2009 . Like Mynx 6/7F Vascular Closure Device , receive FDA approval May 16 , 2007 , design achieve femoral artery hemostasis via delivery extravascular , water-soluble synthetic sealant expand upon contact subcutaneous fluid seal arteriotomy . In theory , lack pressure need clamp , suture , clip cinch , require intravascular closure device , may provide advantage regard increase patient comfort closure device deployment use Mynx . Although VCDs demonstrate increase patient comfort satisfaction manual compression , little data exists regard patient comfort compare different closure device . This study design evaluate patient comfort MynxM5 Angio-Seal Evolution Vascular Closure Devices .</detailed_description>
