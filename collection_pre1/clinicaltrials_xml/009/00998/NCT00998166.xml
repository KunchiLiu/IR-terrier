	<brief_summary>In past , patient advance lung cancer inoperable underwent chemotherapy one chemotherapeutic agent . More recently , novel new agent target specific enzyme pathways responsible cell division develop clinician begin utilize various combination drug standard chemotherapeutic agent treatment NSCLC . Some approach demonstrate small significant increase survival among patient advanced disease . Because recently complete Phase 3 study bevacizumab + Taxol/Carboplatin first line NSCLC therapy demonstrate 23 % improvement median survival , would appeal see regimen bevacizumab/ cisplatin/Alimta would also demonstrate similar , perhaps well , response rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Cisplatin + Pemetrexed + Avastin First-Line Therapy Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority patient NSCLC present inoperable locally advanced metastatic disease curative therapy available . For patient , platinum base doublet combination regimens become standard care due increase survival rate platinum therapy alone . In order try improve overall survival , clinician attempt add third cytotoxic agent standard regimen ( ) . Although approach demonstrate improved objective response , additional benefit note overall survival . Recent development approval new targeted chemotherapy past 10 year prompt clinical trial test efficacy newly FDA approve agent gefitinib , erlotinib , bevacizumab advance NSCLC . Although gefitinib erlotinib demonstrate clinical activity refractory NSCLC , neither agent improved clinical outcome add standard 1st line platinum base chemotherapy . In contrast , recently complete randomized Phase 3 trial investigate addition bevacizumab 1st line paclitaxel plus carboplatin chemotherapy report 23 % improvement median overall survival paclitaxel/carboplatin plus bevacizumab treatment arm ( 12.5m vs. 10.2m ; p=0.007 ) . It therefore appeal study cisplatin combination bevacizumab determine additive benefit . Pemetrexed ideal agent use combination cisplatin since well tolerate efficacy comparable cisplatin combination . Patients receive maximum 6 cycle . Those complete 1 cycle evaluate toxicity ; 1 cycle , response .</detailed_description>
