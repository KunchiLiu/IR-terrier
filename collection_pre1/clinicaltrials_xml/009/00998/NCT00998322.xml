	<brief_title>A Study REOLYSIN® Combination With Gemcitabine Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer remain one lethal cancer , rank fourth lead cause cancer death men woman . The American Cancer Society estimate 37,170 men woman ( 18,830 men 18,340 woman ) diagnose pancreatic cancer 33,370 men woman die pancreatic cancer 2008 . Activating KRAS mutation frequent genetic abnormality pancreatic cancer ( occur 75 % 95 % patient ) . REOLYSIN demonstrate kill wide variety cell mutation along RAS pathway , include pancreatic cancer cell . The Phase 2 study design characterize efficacy safety REOLYSIN give intravenously combination gemcitabine every 3 week patient advance pancreatic cancer . Response primary endpoint trial . Tumors evaluate CT scan within 14 day start treatment , 6 week , every 6 week thereafter . The safety gemcitabine REOLYSIN combination assess evaluation type , frequency severity adverse event , change clinical laboratory test , immunogenicity physical examination . Patients may continue receive therapy protocol , provide he/she experience either progressive disease unacceptable drug-related toxicity respond either supportive care dose reduction .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>advanced metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma previously receive chemotherapy biotherapy . Patients receive radiotherapy without radiotherapy enhancer ( low dose 5FU ) eligible . evidence measurable disease . However , lesion previous radiation field consider nonevaluable response . Therefore , patient must measurable lesion previously irradiate field eligible . NO continue acute toxic effect ( except alopecia ) prior radiotherapy surgical procedure , i.e. , effect must resolve Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE , Version 3.0 ) Grade ≤1 . Surgery ( except biopsy ) must occur least 28 day prior study enrolment . receive NO radiotherapy within 28 day prior receive study drug . ECOG Performance Score ≤ 2. life expectancy least 3 month . absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9 [ SI unit 10^9/L ] ; Platelets ≥ 100 x10^9 [ SI unit 10^9/L ] ( without platelet transfusion ) ; Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN ; Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ; AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( ≤ 5 x ULN patient liver metastasis ) . negative pregnancy test female childbearing potential . concurrent therapy investigational anticancer agent study . history current evidence brain metastasis ( e ) . immunosuppressive therapy ; know HIV infection active hepatitis B C. pregnant breastfeed woman . clinically significant cardiac disease . dementia alter mental status would prohibit informed consent . severe , acute , chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment Principal Investigator , would make patient inappropriate study .</criteria>
