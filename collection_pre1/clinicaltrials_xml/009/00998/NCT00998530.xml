	<brief_summary>The hypothesis test trial different epidemiologic ( include racial difference ) phenotypic manifestation exhibit Trichomonas clinical isolates infection correlate genotypic strain classification . Two specific aim propose test hypothesis . Specific aim 1 . Assess significance genotypic phenotypic difference Trichomonas strain among African American woman HIV status . Specific aim 2 . Determine significance genotypic phenotypic difference Trichomonas strain circulate among woman two different racial group , African American woman Caucasian woman . The overall goal specific aim identify racial difference genotypic phenotypic characteristic Trichomonas strain , develop ability identify classify Trichomonas infection order prioritize treatment epidemiologic follow-up individual infect isolates associate adverse clinical outcome ( HIV transmission acquisition , pregnancy complication , virulence , drug resistance ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite serious public health consequence , widespread prevalence , rise drug resistance treatment failure , little do study role T. vaginalis genotype transmission , virulence , occurrence mixed infection , spread drug resistance , primarily due lack suitable assay rapid strain typing . Previously utilized genotyping technique Trichomonas inadequate due problem speed analysis , sensitivity , reproducibility different lab . Multilocus sequence typing ( MLST ) combine speed , sensitivity , portability , accuracy , reliability determine nucleotide sequence polymorphism ( SNPs ) present small DNA fragment ( 300-400 nt ) amplify polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) number ( usually 6-7 ) neutrally select housekeeping gene . MLST assign allele fragment number ( AFN ) unique SNP combination SNPs present gene fragment us identify unique sequence type ( STs ) base AFN combination collection gene analyze . MLST use extensively study epidemiology , population structure , virulence evolution pathogenic bacteria fungi among eukaryote , due difficulty interpret MLST data diploid organism . However , T. vaginalis differs eukaryote , possess stable haploid set six chromosome , develop MLST genotyping system T. vaginalis clinical isolates . The data ( AFNs STs ) generate T. vaginalis strain MLST scheme develop deposit freely accessible internet database . This MLST scheme use examine relationship strain genotype clinical , epidemiologic , physiologic manifestation trichomoniasis . Trichomoniasis characterize wide spectrum clinical presentation disease sequela . This clinical variability accompany high degree genetic diversity Trichomonas vaginalis clinical isolates originally demonstrate others confirm . We hypothesize correlation genotype clinical presentation true trichomoniasis T. vaginalis isolates differ capacity clinical disease , severity , drug resistance , disease sequela . In support , several study ( 10-40 patient ) show statistically significant correlation genetic relatedness T. vaginalis isolates , use random amplify polymorphic DNA ( RAPD ) technique , clinical presentation . Correlations disease severity trichomoniasis vitro phenotypic property cytoadherence , cytotoxicity expression cysteine proteinase 30 kilo-dalton ( kDa ) protein also report . Significant difference cytoadherence cell monolayers , differential protein expression , phagocytosis target cell , ability exert cytotoxic damage culture cell , pathogenicity mortality mouse demonstrate T. vaginalis clinical isolates , indicate wide variation virulence property present Trichomonas isolates . We also demonstrate four-fold difference secrete cysteine protease activity culture T. vaginalis clinical isolates . The accumulated evidence strongly support correlation individual T. vaginalis strain capacity virulence . For specific study , initial enrollment/diagnosis visit collect T. vaginalis isolates accompany detailed clinical assessment , epidemiological information , result vitro test drug .resistance . This information allow u determine particular strain group strain ( determine MLST genotyping ) associate asymptomatic infection , clinical severity , patient race , treatment failure , drug resistance , mixed infection sexual history use univariate multivariate analysis . This significant positive association particular strain group strain factor , expect find , necessitate change way trichomoniasis manage treat reference strain identify . We also independently test variable correlation identify variable combination variable may associate clinical manifestation trichomoniasis . The information gather also permit good understand trichomoniasis many additional way . We culture T. vaginalis test cure ( TOC ) follow-up visit genotype determine drug resistance order distinguish potential treatment failure conversion drug resistance ( genotype original visit ) re-infection another contact ( different genotype ) . This particularly significant HIV+ woman Trichomonas vaginalis infection difficult cure T. vaginalis may persist , undetectable culture , re-emerge six month later . Trichomonas vaginalis detect TOC visit much high rate ( 36 % ) HIV+ woman HIV- woman ( 8 % ) infection ascribe treatment failure . Recent report describe persistent , undetected T. vaginalis infection culture 3 6 month initial negative TOC result woman report intervene sexual contact . This significant correlation strain genotype persistent infection identify HIV+ individual need multiple TOC visit , use sensitive diagnostic test , perhaps longer treatment course .</detailed_description>
