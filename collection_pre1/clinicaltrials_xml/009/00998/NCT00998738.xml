	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study calcium magnesium see well work prevent peripheral neuropathy cause ixabepilone patient breast cancer . Giving calcium together magnesium may stop delay development peripheral neuropathy patient cancer receive treatment ixabepilone . It yet know whether calcium magnesium effective prevent peripheral neuropathy cause ixabepilone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcium Magnesium Preventing Peripheral Neuropathy Caused Ixabepilone Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare ixabepilone-induced peripheral neuropathy ( sensory ) measure European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality life Questionnaire ( QLQ ) -Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy ( CIPN ) 20 sensory subscale calcium ( Ca ) Magnesium ( Mg ) placebo arm . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare incidence CTCAE measure grade 2+ and/or grade 3+ peripheral neuropathy CaMg placebo arm . II . To compare time onset CTCAE measure grade 2+ and/or grade 3+ peripheral neuropathy CaMg placebo arm . III . To compare proportion patient require ixabepilone dose reduction and/or stop ixabepilone secondary peripheral neuropathy ( sensory ) CaMg placebo arm . IV . To assess toxicity CaMg situation . V. To document incidence severity acute pain syndrome ( APS , commonly know arthralgias/myalgias ) induce ixabepilone . VI . To evaluate whether CaMg decrease acute pain syndrome ( APS ) . VII . To evaluate incidence characteristic , change , ixabepilone-APS several cycle . VIII . To evaluate association ixabepilone-APS eventual chemotherapy-induced neuropathy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive calcium gluconate magnesium sulfate IV 30 minute immediately ixabepilone administration . ARM II : Patients receive placebo IV 30 minute immediately ixabepilone administration . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 12 month .</detailed_description>
