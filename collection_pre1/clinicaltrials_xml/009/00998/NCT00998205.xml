	<detailed_description>The heart become `` stiff '' due increase fibrous tissue decrease elasticity heart tissue one earliest change cause heart failure . These change detect simple non-invasive echocardiogram technique . However , technique usually detect increase `` stiffness '' heart progress significant extent . The investigator hypothesize stress heart use Dobutamine infusion measure fill pressure use echocardiogram , provide tool identify change earlier . The investigator plan include people normal heart function . It standard procedure measure cardiac pressure catheterization . Simultaneously , investigator infuse Dobutamine ( standard drug use chemical stress testing , DSE ) . This drug increase heart rate mimic exercise normal human unable exercise various reason . The investigator would continue monitor pressure inside heart infuse Dobutamine see increase filling pressure . The investigator correlate invasive pressure echo derive measurement . The investigator plan include 25 veteran study . For individual study would increase amount time spend Catheterization Lab 30 120 minute . The entire procedure monitor Advanced Cardiac Life Support ( ACLS ) certify nurses doctor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Prospectively enroll 25 veteran age range 18 65 find normal left ventricular ( LV ) systolic function significant coronary artery disease cardiac catheterization . Subjects identify routine cardiac test significant diastolic dysfunction may also enrol rule coronary disease study DSE invasive pressure correlation . Exclusion criterion : Patients LV systolic dysfunction , severe coronary lesion ( &gt; 50 % ) , uncontrolled hypertension ( BP &gt; 160/100 ) significant pulmonary hypertension ( PASP &gt; 50 mmHg ) would exclude . Subject include significant rhythm abnormality , frequent premature ventricular complex , atrial fibrillation technical reason catheterization laboratory preclude study protocol .</criteria>
