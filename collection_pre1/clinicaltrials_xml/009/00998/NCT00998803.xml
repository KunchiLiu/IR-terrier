	<brief_summary>Influenza virus infection major cause morbidity mortality . The limited exist knowledge impact influenza immunocompromised patient suggest increase risk influenza virus acquisition , develop complication prolong illness viral shedding . However , data effect antiviral agent infection course , risk resistance immunocompromised child lack . The emergence pandemic H1N1 swine-origin influenza A virus generate additional need study epidemiology , clinical course outcome influenza infection immunocompromised child . This study propose conduct prospective observational clinical study answer question .</brief_summary>
