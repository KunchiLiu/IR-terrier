	<brief_title>Effect Bromocriptine Left Ventricular Function Women With Peripartum Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripartum cardiomyopathy ( PPCM ) serious life threaten heart disease unknown etiology previously healthy woman . Only minority patient recovers completely majority PPCM patient develop persistent ventricular dysfunction may experience severe heart failure lead cardiac transplantation . Thus , young patient sick time newborn would need healthy mother . Many PPCM patient need lifelong treatment cause large financial social burden . Indeed , good understand disease efficient therapeutic option urgently need . To date , specific therapy available patient treat medical pharmacotherapy heart failure . Diagnosis PPCM usually make advanced stage disease severely symptomatic woman prognosis affect woman poor report mortality rate 15 % recovery 23 % 54 % PPCM patient despite optimal medical treatment . Therefore strategy urgently need identify patient risk novel therapeutic approach require improve poor prognosis affect woman . The trial would establish new specific therapeutic regimen PPCM investigator expect novel approach would rapidly adopt clinical management disease . Since trial design follow state-of the-art guideline , investigator assume bromocriptine would shortly adopt clinical guideline German Cardiac Society , European Cardiac Society , American Heart Association .</detailed_description>
