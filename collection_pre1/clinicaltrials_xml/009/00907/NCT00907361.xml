	<brief_title>The MagnaSafe Registry : Determining Risks Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Presence Pacemakers Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators ( ICDs )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MagnaSafe Registry investigator initiate study design determine risk perform MRI patient pacemaker Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators ( ICDs ) . We hope result registry provide physician risk-assessment data need ass use MRI diagnostic tool alternative diagnostic image technology appropriate . The number patient live permanent pacemaker ICD device United States increase dramatically result expand indication . Between 1990 2005 , estimate 2.8 million pacemaker 690,000 ICDs implant United States . The number implanted device continue increase without apparent plateau . Magnetic resonance image modality choice diagnosis many disease brain , spinal cord , musculoskeletal system . For disease state , acceptable alternative diagnostic imaging method available . As number implant cardiac device increase , clinical indication MRI expand well . Marketing research estimate approximately 27.5 million MRI procedure complete 2007 ( The Medical Information Division IMV , LTD ) . It predict 50-75 % probability patient pacemaker ICD need MRI lifetime device . Most physician consider presence pacemaker ICD absolute contraindication MRI study . Patients deny examination , even MR clearly superior diagnostic modality acceptable alternative image test available . To provide optimal care increase number patient implanted cardiac device , health care professional must capability perform MR image minimal risk full knowledge possible complication . The present study create registry patient pacemaker ICDs undergo clinically indicate MRI document adverse event change device parameter may associate imaging procedure . The result registry provide medical community accurate documentation risk patient establish protocol patient screen device reprogramming purpose maximize safe performance MRI diagnostic tool patient implantable cardiac device indicate . This physician-initiated study coordinate Scripps Clinic , Green Hospital . It perform IDE FDA . Funding MagnaSafe Registry come multiple source include competitive grant , institutional grant , foundation fellowship support , unrestricted educational grant industry , philanthropy . Scripps Clinic/Green Hospital , La Jolla , CA , perform 125 MRIs patient implant cardiac device . Results retrospective clinical observation Scripps Clinic present American Heart Association 2008 Scientific American College Cardiology 2009 Scientific Sessions . Up 35 site recruit participate registry . The registry use protocol design minimize potential risk patient device . MRI compatible equipment require monitor vital sign ( non-invasive blood pressure monitoring , pulse oximeter , single lead cardiac rhythm monitor ) performing scan patient implanted device . Recommendations American Heart Association performance MR examination patient pacemaker ICDs follow . The MRI procedure conduct clinical purpose discretion order physician . MR examination patient permanent implanted cardiac device perform highly compelling circumstance benefit clearly outweigh risk opinion order physician . The decision MRI must base clinical indication , part research protocol . Those wish participate registry investigational site require obtain approval FDA-authorized protocol review IRB , complete write investigator agreement .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Male female 18 year older Able provide inform consent Permanent implant pacemaker ICD Strong clinical indication MRI ; clinical setting MRI diagnostic modality choice specific disease state without acceptable alternative image technology determine order physician . Patient schedule nonthoracic MRI ( joint , extremity , brain , pelvis , cervical , lumbar sacral spine ) Metallic object represent contraindication MR imaging , include : intraorbital intraocular retain metal fragment , intracranial vascular clip coil Claustrophobia unresponsive preprocedure sedatives Morbid obesity ( abdominal diameter &gt; 60 cm ) ICD pacemaker generator placement prior 2002 ICD pace dependent Pregnancy Device generator battery voltage elective replacement index ( ERI ) Presence active implantable medical device ( pacemaker ICD ) Presence abandon lead ( exception post CABG temporary epicardial pacing wire ) Presence implant cardiac device abdominal position Pacemaker ICD label MRIConditional ( approved FDA exposure MRI ) .</criteria>
