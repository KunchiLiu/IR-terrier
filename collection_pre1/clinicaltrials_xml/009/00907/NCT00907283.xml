	<brief_summary>This trial multicenter , unblinded , single-arm pilot study , last one year ( plus one year extension Amendment n.3 25 August 2009 , plus two year follow-up Amendment n.7 ) , evaluate efficacy safety chelator therapy deferiprone cerebral iron accumulation . The drug administer dosage 15 mg/kg twice daily . The safety tolerability drug evaluate measure hemochrome every seven day leukocyte formula count . At 3 , 6 12 month start treatment , neurological evaluation perform use several specific evaluation scale ( International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale ( ICARS ) ; Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) ; Burke-Fahn-Marsden ( BFM ) ) . Every 6 month treatment , brain magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) aim measure iron overload quantitatively , possible .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The time interval Study Start Date Study First Received related bureaucratic problem . The treatment systemic iron overload recent year improve notably since new drug new therapeutic combination become available use . Conversely , therapy removal regional iron overload cerebral level describe literature . As know , symptom result cerebral iron overload strongly disable , reduce patient 's autonomy . Considering valid therapeutic alternative proven preventive and/or curative efficacy neurodegenerative disease exist today , use lipophilic iron chelators must consider possible therapeutic strategy worthy deeper study . Deferiprone oral active iron chelator , use authorize treatment iron overload patient affect thalassemia major condition `` chelation suitable Desferal . '' In recent year , deferiprone apply extensively , demonstrate good efficacy tolerability profile . Unlike deferoxamine , hydrophilic drug , deferiprone present chemical-physical characteristic ( low molecular weight , favourable octanol : water partition coefficient , neutral charge ) guarantee drug good permeability mitochondrial wall blood-brain barrier . In recent study deferiprone ( commercial name Ferriprox ) use 13 patient Friedreich 's ataxia ( FA ) , also treat idebenone ( experimental drug anti-oxidant action ) , compare 9 patient affected FA treat Idebenone . The 9 patient complete 6 month treatment deferiprone evaluate clinical point view use ICARS Scale ( International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Score ) start 1 6 month therapy . They also perform cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging 1 , 2 , 4 6 month treatment . The result promise . In fact , 6 month therapy , reduction iron accumulation specific cerebral area involve pathogenesis neurodegenerative disease demonstrate . The patient also present significant clinical improvement confirm ICARS score . Therefore use deferiprone , despite possible side effect ( gastrointestinal disturbance , temporary increase transaminase , especially agranulocytosis find 1 % patient treat deferiprone ) , currently represent possibility remove and/or prevent accumulation iron central nervous system , cure and/or avoid severe debilitate consequence disease another therapy exist . The Centers specialize treatment iron accumulation acquire significant experience use new oral iron chelators last 10 year , permit deferiprone use carefully safely three case hand . We therefore propose use drug treat patient show neurological symptom correlate cerebral iron overload show MRI benefit therapy .</detailed_description>
