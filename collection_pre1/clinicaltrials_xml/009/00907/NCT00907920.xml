	<brief_title>Studying Tumor Samples From Young Patients With Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Subtype : Ancillary/Correlative Observational Study Model : Cohort Time Perspective : Retrospective Biospecimen Retention : Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description : Tissue Study Population Description : Patients previously enrol clinical trial COG-ANBL00B1 Sampling Method : Non-Probability Sample PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To comprehensively identify characterize spectrum frequency mutation ALK across neuroblastoma disease subset use methodology resource neutral Children 's Oncology Group Neuroblastoma Nucleic Acids Bank . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To formulate genetic screening recommendation newly diagnose patient without family history neuroblastoma . II . To identify functionally relevant ALK mutation pharmacologically inhibit . III . To test prognostic capability ALK alteration . IV . To determine clinical significance ALK mutation and/or genomic rearrangement combine ALK mutation , amplification , translocation data overall within neuroblastoma risk group correlate information clinical phenotype ( i.e. , age , International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage , International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification ) ; genetic factor ( i.e. , ploidy , MYCN status ) ; patient outcome . OUTLINE : Tumor DNA sample examine mutation analysis germline somatic mutation ALK tyrosine kinase domain . Samples analyze whole genome amplification use polymerase chain reaction sequence DNA alteration entire ALK coding sequence . Samples also examine single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) polymorphism analysis . Exploratory multivariable analysis perform test prognostic ability ALK mutation presence know prognostic variable ( i.e. , age , International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage , MYCN status , International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification , diploidy ) . A subset tumor DNA sample high-risk patient resequenced DNA alteration determine whether additional region ALK , outside tyrosine kinase domain , prone mutation sequence large panel .</detailed_description>
