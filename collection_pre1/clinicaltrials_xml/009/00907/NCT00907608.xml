	<detailed_description>Diabetes lead cause end stage renal disease cardiovascular disease 60 percent global diabetic population come Asia . Growing evidence confirms predictive role chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) cardiovascular morbidity mortality . This due constellation conventional non-conventional risk factor patient develop CKD , anemia , inflammation abnormal bone metabolism . In regard , anemia risk factor cardiovascular disease all-cause mortality patient CKD , patient leave ventricular dysfunction general population . Effective erythropoiesis dependent production erythropoietin kidney . Anemia common finding patient diabetes 20 % diabetic patient note anemia . In meta-analysis community-based population study , anemia interacts CKD increase risk coronary heart disease , stroke all-cause mortality among patient diabetes . Previous study examine effect erythropoietin therapy anemic subject CKD find statistical difference mortality rate treat untreated group . Possible explanation lack benefit include high level blood pressure increase blood viscosity lead worsen chronic congestive heart failure treat subject . We hypothesize partial correction hemoglobin may appropriate .</detailed_description>
