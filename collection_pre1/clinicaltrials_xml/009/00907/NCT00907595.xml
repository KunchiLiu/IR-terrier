	<brief_summary>The propose study double-blind , placebo control pilot study HD , PD , DLB subject sleep disturbance . This study design determine effect 4 week Ramelteon treatment sleep pattern people basal ganglia disorder HD , PD DLB . The study also aim look sleep pattern caregiver people HD , PD DLB .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating Sleep/Wake Cycle Disturbances Basal Ganglia Disorders With Ramelteon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Huntington 's disease ( HD ) progressively degenerative brain disorder , result loss mental physical ability . It genetically determine people carry HD gene invariably develop clinical disorder point life . HD symptom consist neuropsychiatric change motor movement . Once present , symptoms progressive nature eventually fatal . Currently cure HD . Like HD , Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) Dementia Lewy Bodies ( DLB ) also neurodegenerative disorder affect basal ganglion . PD DLB synucleinopathies - i.e. , associate dysfunction protein alpha-synuclein . Unlike HD , PD DLB inherit autosomal dominant manner . Sleep/wake cycle HD , PD DLB . HD patient , especially moderate severe stage disease , frequently complain difficulty fall stay asleep . Little known phenomenology pathophysiology sleep disturbance HD . The study address issue sleep HD find disturbance sleep architecture sleep/wake cycle . Overall , literature sleep circadian disturbance HD limit . If sleep/wake cycle disturbance HD pathophysiological mechanism similar neurodegenerative disorder , Ramelteon , hypnotic agent melatonin receptor agonist , may beneficial sleep/wake cycle disturbance HD . Sleep disruption circadian sleep disruption integral clinical presentation PD DLB . As true HD , sleep disturbance PD DLB cause severe disruption patient caregiver ' life . In PD , sleep dysfunction occur approximately two third patient . Sleep problem range difficulty sleep initiation , sleep fragmentation , disturbance circadian rhythm , REM sleep behavior disorder ( RBD ) , excessive daytime sleepiness . Frequent nighttime awaken sleep disruption common sleep problem PD . In DLB , REM sleep behavior disorder ( RBD ) occur year decade onset dementia . Importantly , melatonin one main treatment use RBD . Therefore , melatonin agonist Ramelteon natural choice treatment circadian sleep disturbance PD DLB . Activity monitor ( actigraphs ) use alternative polysomnography ( PSG ) . Actigraphs small electronic motion sensor detect movement three ax provide information subject ' activity level period day week . Using validated algorithm infer wakefulness sleep , investigator draw conclusion individual ' sleep/wake cycle pattern activity pattern .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>We recruit 24 Huntington 's disease , Parkinson 's Disease , Dementia Lewy Bodies subject . Assuming dropout rate 20 % , expect 20 24 subject initially enroll complete study . Inclusion criterion follow : Subjects HD age 20 65 year old ; Subjects PD DLB age 40 90 ; Subjects subjective complaint sleep problem caregiver complain subject sleep well Subjects severity HD , PD , DLB symptom accept long complain sleep problem A diagnosis HD , PD , DLB . For HD patient , positive HD gene status everyone except caregiver obtain clinical reason know time enrollment study . PD patient clinical diagnosis PD . DLB patient diagnosis possible probably DLB base consensus criterion ( outline McKeith et al. , 2005 ) . Subjects willing able participate inform consent process . Exclusion criterion follow : Subjects unable participate inform consent process Subjects previously document primary sleep disorder ( unrelated HD , PD , DLB ) , include Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome , Periodic Limb Movement Disorder Sleep , Narcolepsy . Subjects take fluvoxamine , rifampin , ketoconazole , fluconazole within 30 day baseline Subjects hepatic impairment Subjects perform shift work circadian rhythm abnormality disruption Subjects diagnose Major Depressive Episode , current time enrollment ( subject may history Major Depressive Episode long partial full remission time enrollment ) Subjects diagnosed manic hypomanic episode , current time enrollment ( subject may history manic hypomanic episode long full remission time enrollment ) Subjects time enrollment receive hypnotic agent hypnotic agent two week prior enrollment Subjects pregnant time enrollment intend become pregnant period study participation Subjects opinion research personnel would able participate research protocol agitation , lack transportation , reason .</criteria>
