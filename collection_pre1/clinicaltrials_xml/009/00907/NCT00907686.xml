	<brief_summary>The spread viruses transfusion cause serious illness death recipient whose immune system unable fight infection . Another group patient whose immune system underdevelop affected particular virus know cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) low birthweight infant ( LBWIs ) . CMV spread placenta , birth process , breast milk , hospital care someone carry virus well transfusion , know transfusion-transmitted ( TT-CMV ) . The spread TT-CMV LBWIs curtail transfuse blood product CMV negative well filter white cell blood carry virus ( leukoreduction ) . The purpose study see use two strategy lower spread CMV transfusion . How `` safe '' blood actually leukoreduction know CMV still occur LBWIs . It clear whether approach optimal whether additional safety step need completely prevent TT-CMV . Specific action could tell u virus reach blood product breast milk test determine virus slip `` unnoticed '' and/or product thoroughly filter . In study , investigator believe use prevention strategy result low rate TT-CMV , `` cause '' TT-CMV may find presence CMV DNA level unfiltered white cell remain blood product . Thus , significant clinical question remain addressed whether double strategy transfusion safety actually provide `` zero CMV-risk '' blood supply whether safety measure ( DNA test + 100 % leukoreduction ) must use protect extremely vulnerable patient group CMV infection . This birth cohort study do 6 participate NICUs , study CMV positive negative mother order estimate rate pathway CMV transmission LBWI receive transfusion . Another study goal compare link CMV infection either transfuse unit virus undetected , filter failure . If CMV disease occur , investigator able describe course outcome LBWIs develop TT-CMV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TT-CMV Observational Birth Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim birth cohort study estimate incidence TT-CMV LBWIs receive combination CMV-seronegative + leukoreduced blood product . That say , effectiveness two strategy couple together assessed prevention TT-CMV at-risk LBWI born CMV-negative CMV-positive mother . The following hypothesis relate primary aim , incidence TT-CMV elevate population LBWIs born CMV-positive mother . According report literature , breakthrough TT-CMV infection occur low rate ( &lt; 2.5 % incidence ) LBWIs CMV-negative mother transfuse seronegative plus leukoreduced blood component . The secondary aim study detect CMV DNA and/or elevate residual WBC count blood component transfuse LBWIs determine whether result related episode breakthrough TT-CMV study population . Original sample size consideration base estimate compare rate TT-CMV infection VLBW infant born CMV-seropositive mother CMV-seronegative mother . Assuming 2.55 % TT-CMV rate infant bear CMV-seropositive mother 0.5 % TT-CMV rate infant bear CMV-seronegative mother , sample size 650 infant per group would need recruit detect difference approximately 2 % TT-CMV rate 80 % power ( 2-sided Fisher 's exact test 5 % significance level ) . After three year accrual follow-up incidence TT-CMV 0 % . Sample size calculation revise use 95 % confidence interval single group VLBW infants regardless maternal CMV serostatus . The necessary sample size 300 transfuse VLBW infant base one-sided exact 95 % confidence interval single proportion 0.0 upper bound 0.01 .</detailed_description>
