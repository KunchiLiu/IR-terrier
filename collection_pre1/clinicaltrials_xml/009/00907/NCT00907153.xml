The protocol modify add follow specific aim : To compare vascular function healthy age BMI similar match woman PCOS woman pre-treatment . Our hypothesis PCOS woman great attenuation retinal vascular reactivity compare healthy control woman , demonstrate poor endothelial function . We currently recruit healthy woman age BMI similar PCOS woman measure retinal vascular reactivity comparison PCOS woman 's pre-treatment vascular reactivity . These healthy woman baseline visit retinal vascular reactivity measure . They enrol placebo Vitamin D randomization process describe .</detailed_description>
