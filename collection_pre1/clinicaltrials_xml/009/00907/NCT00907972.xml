	<brief_summary>Health care burden neurodegenerative disease expect increase disproportionately . Increasing age also predispose population chronic disease include osteoporosis , progressive systemic skeletal disease characterize low bone mass , lead increase susceptibility fracture . In United States , 44 million people estimate risk osteoporosis low bone mass emphasize enormity public health problem . Parkinson 's disease progressive neurodegenerative disorder affect 1 million people . Evidence indicate Parkinson 's disease patient high risk low bone mineral density , contribute increase fracture compare healthy subject . In fact , several risk factor osteoporosis patient PD identify , include advanced stage PD , low body mass index , inadequate sunlight exposure decrease vitamin D level . Some factor conjunction decrease immobilization may occur PD , put patient increase risk fracture . Few study however examine bone marker PD patient . Even few study examine impact Vitamin D supplementation bone metabolism mineralization PD patient . Vitamin D essential component bone health , promote calcium absorption gut maintain adequate serum calcium phosphate concentration , enable normal mineralization bone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease second common neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer 's disease affect approximately 1 % population old 50 year . There worldwide increase disease prevalence due increase age human population . The disease characterize tremor , stiffness limb trunk , impaired balance coordination , slow movement , lead immobility frequent fall . Patients also sometimes develop symptom , include difficulty swallowing , disturbed sleep , emotional problem . Parkinson 's disease result loss dopaminergic neuron substantia nigra region brain . The cause mechanism continue neuron cell death substantia nigra currently unknown . Epidemiological study suggest association Parkinson 's disease osteoporosis , vitamin D inadequacy alter bone mineral metabolism . Accumulating evidence indicate patient Parkinson 's disease high risk fracture compare healthy subject . This could attribute several contribute factor include increased rate fall , vitamin D deficiency , reduce body mass index reduce bone mineral density .</detailed_description>
