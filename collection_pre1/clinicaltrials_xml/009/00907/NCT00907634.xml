	<brief_summary>The purpose study find cervix normally move radiation treatment . This study also evaluate cervical cancer shrink chemotherapy radiation . By good understand two thing , investigator see radiation could safely give focused way future . The investigational portion study include ( 1 ) daily cone beam CT scan confirm transponder placement evaluate tumor change treatment ( 2 ) track movement cervix daily radiation treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Intrafractional Interfractional Cervical Motion During External Beam Radiation Intact Cervical Cancer Calypso® 4D Localization System™</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There recent interest use Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) , form focal external beam radiation intact cervical cancer . IMRT propose ( 1 ) alternative treatment whole pelvis attempt reduce dose radiation deliver normal tissue ( 2 ) replacement brachytherapy integrate sequential radiation boost instead intracavitary brachytherapy . At tumor site , IMRT allow radiation dose escalation tumor spar adjacent normal tissue . IMRT require great accuracy target understanding tumor organ motion tumor regression radiotherapy protect adjacent normal tissue prevent tumor underdosage . Currently , limit knowledge cervical organ motion . Previous study evaluate interfractional cervical motion [ daily set-up variation , i.e . location cervix Day 1 vs. Day 2 Day 30 radiation treatment ] weekly CT MRI scan localization fiducial marker evaluate fluoroscopy daily radiation therapy . There publish literature regard intrafractional cervical motion [ motion single radiation treatment ] . We propose prospective clinical trial utilize Calypso® 4D Localization System™ evaluate intrafractional interfractional cervical motion intact cervical cancer . The Calypso® 4D Localization System™ FDA approve tumor localization system adjunctive use patient undergo radiation therapy prostate cancer . The system design provide accurate , objective , continuous 3-dimensional localization treatment target patient alignment target position monitor relative isocenter linear accelerator . The Calypso system consist implantable electromagnetic transponder , unique resonant frequency . An array place patient remain place radiation delivery . Source coil array emit electromagnetic signal excite transponder identify position individual transponder . The transponder position continuously monitor throughout treatment delivery reporting transponder motion lateral , superior-inferior ( SI ) , anterior-posterior ( AP ) direction . Our goal enroll 10 patient 1-2 year time period intact cervical cancer ( Stage IB-IVA ) receive definitive radiation therapy Emory University Hospital Emory Crawford Long Hospital . Two Calypso beacon attach within cervical `` Smit '' sleeve [ 1 superior , 1 inferior ] place within cervical o prior CT simulation ( radiation planning session ) . The cervical sleeve suture 2 stitch . The location transponder track throughout treatment delivery . Daily cone beam CT radiation treatment machine also utilized confirm transponder placement evaluate tumor volume change treatment course . There treatment field modification base cervical ( transponder ) displacement . While enrolled study , patient treat current standard care treatment : 5 week external beam radiation concurrent weekly cisplatin follow focal radiation `` boost '' use intracavitary brachytherapy . The 5 week external beam radiation therapy deliver conventional 4-field technique whole pelvis total 45Gy 1.8 Gy per fraction . All external beam radiation treatment deliver Emory Clinic , Clifton Road . The cervical sleeve remove following external beam portion therapy . The calypso beacon provide free charge study additional cost patient Radiation Oncology Department patient enrol study . No additional risk anticipate patient enrol study compare current standard care treatment . The `` test '' part protocol outside standard care treatment intact cervical cancer would use ( 1 ) Calypso array use localize calypso `` beacon '' ( 2 ) daily cone-beam CT scan evaluate cervical cancer response therapy . The Radiation Oncology department regularly use system patient set-up solid tumor additional charge test . We believe study great improve current knowledge cervical cancer motion tumor regression radiation therapy . There concern small radiation field , would deliver IMRT could underdose portion tumor result inadequate local tumor control compromise cure . As result study able infer IMRT safe reasonable treatment option patient intact cervical cancer . Knowledge extent direction cervical motion also help determine IMRT treatment margin .</detailed_description>
