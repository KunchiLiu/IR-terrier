	<brief_summary>This study SCH 900776 ( MK-8776 ) evaluate safety tolerability give combination cytarabine participant acute leukemia . Participants Dose-Escalation Part enrol cohort receive sequentially high dose MK-8776 combination standard dose cytarabine . Only one combination treatment cycle approximately 4 6 week anticipate , participant may receive additional cycle clinically indicated discussion Investigator Sponsor . The recommended combination dose Phase 2 trial ( RP2D ) determine base safety biological activity . Up 10 15 additional participant study combination RP2D .</brief_summary>
