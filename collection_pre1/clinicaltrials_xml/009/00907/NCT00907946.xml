	<brief_title>Comparing Previously Placed Nephrostomy Tract ( NT ) Versus Single Stage Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy ( PCNL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We seek identify whether placement nephrostomy tract prior surgery versus time PCNL : 1. decrease blood loss related complication , 2. decrease infection-related complication provide ability accurate collection urine culture initiate appropriate antibiotic treatment prior definitive stone management . In addition , seek determine whether renal puncture fluoroscopic v ultrasonic guidance associate less blood loss . Although retrospective study show benefit place nephrostomy tube prior surgery term decrease blood loss , well-designed , prospective study compare two treatment approach . We seek determine treatment approach safer , efficacious , cost-effective prospective , randomized trial .</detailed_description>
