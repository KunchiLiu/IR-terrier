	<brief_summary>LBH589 drug may slow growth cancer cell kill cancer cell block certain enzyme . LBH589 show effect cancer laboratory study study use animal ; however , know medicine show activity human . As May 2006 , approximately 100 patient receive treatment either intravenous capsule form LBH589 . Only capsule form LBH589 use study . In addition , information research study laboratory study suggest study drug may help treat lung cancer . The main goal Phase I portion research study find high safest dose LBH589 give combination pemetrexed subject lung cancer without cause severe side effect . The main goal Phase II portion study find patient 's lung cancer respond LBH589 combination pemetrexed . This study also investigate patient 's body process combination LBH589 pemetrexed . To determine , investigator measure amount study drug patient 's blood . This do series blood test , call pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . Other purpose study determine side effect LBH589 combination pemetrexed whether combination effective treat type cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed LBH589 Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives 1 . To determine maximum tolerate dose LBH589 give three time weekly schedule combine pemetrexed treatment patient advance thoracic malignancy , except squamous cell carcinoma lung ( phase I part ) . 2 . To determine overall response rate non-progression rate ( clinical benefit rate ) progression-free survival combination LBH589 pemetrexed patient previously-treated advanced NSCLC ( phase II part ) . 3 . To determine pharmacodynamic effect LBH589 pemetrexed level histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) 1 6 peripheral blood mononuclear cell , well level vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) level blood . 4 . To identify biomarkers baseline , archival tumor tissue may correlate antitumor efficacy . Subject population Phase I : We enroll patient treat number prior regimen thoracic malignancy , except squamous cell carcinoma lung . Phase II : We enroll patient recurrent progressive NSCLC receive 1 prior chemotherapy regimen ( 1 additional regimen set initial curative treatment allow complete &gt; 1 year earlier ) . Treatment plan - Pemetrexed 500mg/m2 IV , day 1 , every 21 day , first day week LBH589 give . - LBH589 three-times-a-week ( dos least 2 day apart , e.g . Monday , Wednesday , Friday ) , disease progression intolerable toxicity LBH589 start week prior first pemetrexed cycle pharmacodynamic ( PD ) study perform ( week -1 ) Study design sample size : This phase I/II study . Phase I : 9-18 patient ( estimate ) ; Phase II : 17-41 patient ( estimate ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Phase I : number prior regimen allow thoracic malignancy , except squamous cell carcinoma lung . 2 . Phase II : Patients recurrent progressive advanced stage nonsquamous cell NSCLC ( small cell lung cancer/SCLC component ) receive 1 prior chemotherapy regimen advance NSCLC . Chemotherapy part initially potentially curative therapy complete &lt; 1 year count 1 prior regimen . Prior erlotinib one biologic regimen also allow . 3 . Measurable disease ( RECIST ) ( phase II part ) 4 . Patients may receive prior pemetrexed histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDACi ) therapy , include valproic acid , treatment medical condition . 5 . ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) Performance Status ≤ 2 6 . Aged ≥ 18 year old ability provide write informed consent obtain prior participation study relate procedure perform 7 . Patients must meet follow laboratory criterion : Hematology : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm³ Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm³ Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Biochemistry : Total Bilirubin within normal institutional limit . Aspartate aminotransferase/glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( AST/SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase/glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( ALT/SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Creatinine clearance 45 ml/min high calculate use CockcroftGault formula Total serum calcium ( correct serum albumin ) ionize calcium within normal limit ( WNL ) Serum potassium ≥ WNL Serum sodium ≥ WNL Serum albumin ≥ WNL Patients elevate Alkaline Phosphatase due bone metastasis enrol 8 .

A minimum time period 3 week elapse completion extensive radiation therapy recurrent/metastatic disease enrollment study . A minimum 4 week elapse completion chemotherapy experimental therapy enrollment study . At least 2 week elapse prior erlotinib biologic therapy . 12 . If patient history brain metastasis , brain lesion treat surgery and/or radiation stable repeat image . 13 .
