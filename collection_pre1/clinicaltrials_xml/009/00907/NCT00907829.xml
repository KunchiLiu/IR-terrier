	<detailed_description>The incidence stroke-induced hemiparesis among veteran likely rise population age . Post-stroke hemiparesis often mark persistent hand impairment , adversely affect person 's ability work his/her quality life . We believe impairment primarily due neural , rather biomechanical , factor . At muscle level , factor relate either inability activate muscle ( i.e. , low muscle activation ) activate appropriately ( i.e. , abnormal muscle co-activation ) . Currently unclear one largely responsible weakness hand net mechanical effect , e.g. , reduce fingertip force production , could . Determination voluntary muscle force generation could help explain deficit fingertip force production specific direction , well customize treatment approach force generation ability muscle decrease others increase . The goal work explain source neurally-mediated weakness fingertip follow hemiparetic stroke , design experimentally test rehabilitation intervention attempt offset weakness . As refining protocol experimentally test rehabilitation intervention—involving neural block stimulation select muscle decrease increase muscle force generation—it challenge anticipated locate , use ultrasound , small nerve branch individual muscle selective neural blocking . As result design additional intervention , use computer model , reflect physical limitation implementation could still hopefully lead improve fingertip function . We seek novel approach locate block small nerve branch individual muscle individual muscle-based approach rehabilitation expect improvement rehabilitation intervention target group muscle time . The clinical data collect study biomechanical model simulation work provide guidance clinical trial study future .</detailed_description>
