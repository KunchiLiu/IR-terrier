	<detailed_description>We plan undertake randomize control trial evaluate effectiveness office-based educational intervention prevention iron depletion young child . Healthy child recruit community pediatric office serf diverse , urban population . Children randomize intervention education group control education group 9 month age . Blood work ( ~4mL ) complete blood count ferritin along additional measure transferrin , iron , reticulocyte count obtain 24 month age . Rates iron depletion anemia compare two group . The two group also 25-hydroxy vitamin D , calcium alkaline phosphatase level analyze 24 month visit ensure intervention prevention iron depletion adversely affect measure .</detailed_description>
