	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether whole-breast radiation therapy effective give without additional radiation therapy tumor treat patient ductal carcinoma situ . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study breast-conserving surgery follow whole-breast radiation therapy see well work give without additional radiation therapy tumor treat woman ductal carcinoma situ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breast-Conserving Surgery Whole-Breast Radiation Therapy With Without Additional Radiation Therapy Tumor Treating Women With Ductal Carcinoma Situ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Estimate compare local recurrence-free survival woman ductal breast carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) treat breast-conserving surgery follow whole breast irradiation v without radiation tumor bed boost . Secondary - Compare relapse-free survival two arm . - Compare overall survival . - Compare acute late toxicity . - Compare cosmetic result quality life . - Identify patient risk late toxicity use biological test . Tertiary - Store blood sample CEPH ( French Center Human Polymorphism Center ) polymorphism analysis . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . All patient undergo breast-conserving surgery ( single intervention second excision ) margin ≥ 1 mm . A superficial deep margin acceptable surgery leave skin tissue fascia pectoral muscle , respectively . Twelve week later , patient randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo whole breast irradiation ( WBI ) daily , 5 day week 5 week . - Arm II : Patients undergo WBI arm I . Patients also undergo radiation tumor bed boost daily 8 fraction ( weekday ) 2 week . Quality life assess . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year annually 10 year .</detailed_description>
