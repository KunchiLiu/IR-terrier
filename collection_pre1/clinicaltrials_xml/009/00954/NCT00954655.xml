	<brief_title>Study Tumor Samples Patients Undergoing Treatment Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Clinical Trial ACOSOG-Z9001</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To examine polymorphism select gene involve detoxifying/metabolizing DNA repair pathway relation specific mutation type mutation c-kit gene tumor tissue patient gastrointestinal tumor ( GIST ) undergo treatment clinical trial ACOSOG-Z9001 . Secondary - To examine approximately 758 polymorphism among candidate gene involve detoxification/metabolism , cell cycle control , DNA damage/repair relation specific mutation type mutation c-kit gene tumor tissue GIST patient hypothesis generation . ( exploratory ) - To conduct exploratory analysis polymorphism distribution patient . ( exploratory ) - To examine association polymorphism major toxicity ( Grade 3/4 ) adjuvant imatinib mesylate . ( exploratory ) OUTLINE : Tumor sample use polymorphism mutation analysis .</detailed_description>
