	<brief_summary>The purpose research study : 1 . Determine whether deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) two lead ( thin coil wire ) place unilaterally ( one side brain ) beneficial patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) tremor . 2 . Compare two different location DBS lead placement effectiveness treatment muscle tremor respond treatment medication cause multiple sclerosis . 3 . Evaluate side effect may result two DBS lead .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Two Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) Electrodes Treat Post-Traumatic Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical treatment disable multiple sclerosis ( MS ) tremor respond medication proven difficult . To date , prospective blind study evaluate efficacy surgical treatment tremor . Based prior data , study examine use 2 DBS electrode side brain thalamus region ( one area refer `` ventralis intermedius nucleus/ventralis oralis posterior nucleus border , '' `` VIM , '' one region call `` ventralis oralis anterior nucleus/ventralis oralis posterior nucleus border , '' `` VO '' ) treatment MS tremor . This study test effectiveness VIM combine , independent , VO DBS , characterize safety , benefit side effect procedure treatment MS-related tremor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must unequivocal diagnosis Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) result disable tremor indicate score least 3 Tremor Rating Scale ( TRS ) baseline global assessment examiner patient . The patient must history unsatisfactory response medical management . Any patient need try fail least one drug least three four follow medication class : anticholinergic , muscle relaxant , benzodiazepine , beta blocker . Alternatively , patient may also qualify tremorsuppressing medication contraindicate due coexist medical condition drug allergy . The MS patient must disable medically refractory unilateral bilateral upper extremity tremor . Patients associated ipsilateral low extremity tremor exclude . The tremor must meet follow specific diagnostic criterion : The tremor must predominantly postural action ( versus rest ) rhythmic and/or ballistic characteristic . The tremor may feature indicate significant cerebellar etiology ( i.e. , nonprominent ataxia , dysdiadokokinesia , dysmetria ) . The tremor must present either stable progressing great one year . The tremor must disable . Disabling define significant impairment normal function daily life indicate score least 5 Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) Severity scale . Significant medical disease would excessively increase risk perioperative complication ( significant cardiac pulmonary disease , uncontrolled hypertension , inadequately treat major depression ) . More mild nontremor cerebellar dysfunction ( ataxia , dysmetria , dysdiadokokinesia ) . Evidence secondary/atypical movement disorder suggest presence following : history stroke ( ) exposure toxins neuroleptic history encephalitis neurological sign upper motor neuron disease , supranuclear gaze palsy , significant orthostatic hypotension MRI significant evidence severe brain atrophy prohibitive abnormality ( absence thalamic target Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) , lacunar infarct , iron deposit putamen ) . Cognitive dysfunction evidence score less 120 Mattis Dementia Rating Scale ( MDRS ) Such patient exclude significant dementia place patient high risk surgeryinduced deterioration cognitive function , patient might limit ability accurately assess impact DBS . Major psychiatric disorder Structured Clinical Interview ( SCIDIV ) Diagnostic Statistical Manual Version 4 ( DSMIV ) . 45 Patients Major Depression within 3 month entry study exclude . High rate psychiatric comorbidity complicate neurosurgical study . While clean study would exclude patient psychopathology , believe realistic practical , give majority patient advance movement disorder suffer degree anxiety depression . We screen patient psychiatric disorder , treat disorder prior DBS admit patient psychiatrically stable least 3 month prior entry ( without active psychiatric diagnosis SCID criterion ) . Patients implanted device precludes magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) exclude study . Examples device include cochlear implant , spinal cord stimulators , many cardiac pacemaker , old aneurysm clip Patients know need future MRIs diathermy treatment exclude study .</criteria>
