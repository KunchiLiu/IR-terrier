Due deficiency functional GCB , glucocerebroside accumulates within macrophage lead cellular engorgement , organomegaly , organ system dysfunction . The purpose treatment protocol observe safety velaglucerase alfa patient type 1 Gaucher disease either treatment naive ( newly diagnose ) currently treat Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( ERT ) imiglucerase .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Protocol Velaglucerase Alfa Patients With Type 1 Gaucher Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 1 Gaucher disease , common form , account 90 % case Gaucher disease involve CNS . Typical manifestation type 1 Gaucher disease include hepatomegaly , splenomegaly , thrombocytopenia , bleed tendency , anemia , hypermetabolism , skeletal pathology , growth retardation , pulmonary disease , decrease quality life . Velaglucerase alfa ( Gene-Activated™ human glucocerebrosidase ; GA-GCB ) produce continuous human cell line use proprietary gene-activation technology identical amino acid sequence naturally occur human enzyme . Velaglucerase alfa contain terminal mannose residue target enzyme macrophages-the primary target cell Gaucher disease . This treatment protocol observe safety velaglucerase alfa patient type 1 Gaucher disease either treatment naive ( newly diagnose ) currently treat Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( ERT ) imiglucerase . Patients currently treat ERT Gaucher disease receive number unit velaglucerase alfa per month imiglucerase dose dose 30-120 U/kg/month . For patient experience dose reduction imiglucerase treatment due supply constraint pre-reduction monthly dose may use determine monthly dose velaglucerase alfa .</detailed_description>
