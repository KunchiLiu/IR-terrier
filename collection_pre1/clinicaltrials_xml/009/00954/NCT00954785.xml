	<brief_summary>The aim study measure effectiveness treatment 7 day commonly use anti-inflammatory medication namely etoricoxib diclofenac ( Voltaren ) reduce severity pain , swell loss function ( range movement , proprioception ) arise mild moderate sprain ( partial tear ) lateral ( outer ) ligaments ankle joint . This injury commonly know ankle sprain .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 18 45 year ( Rationale : Most injury occur age group , old subject likely concomitant pathology e.g . osteoarthrosis ) Acute lateral ankle ligament sprain le 48 hour ago ( Rationale : It important standardize phase injury enter time maximum inflammatory response , balance enough time allow injured subject access treatment facility , measurement complete ) Grade II ankle sprain injury accord follow : ( Rationale : Standard clinical criterion use ensure severity injury similar subject ) Mild moderate pain ( &gt; 40mm VAS ) Mild moderate lateral ankle swell ( Greater 5 % increase ankle volume compare uninjured side accord volumetric assessment ) Tenderness anterior talofibular ligament Negative urine serum pregnancy test ( female ) sign undertake use adequate contraception duration trial ( Rationale : This make sure pregnant female subject enter become pregnant trial safety precaution drug use pregnancy ) No use analgesic oral intramuscular antiinflammatory drug last 24 hour ( Rationale : This ensure time first assessment , subject take oral intramuscular medication may influence initial assessment pain swell ) No use topical antiinflammatory agent , ice application compression last 12 hour ( Rationale : This ensure time first assessment , subject take topical medication , use ice compression may influence initial assessment pain swell ) Patients history ankle sprain previous 12 month ( Rationale : A recent previous injury ligament may affect heal new injury ) The presence ankle fracture diagnose normal radiograph use Ottowa ankle rule . ( Rationale : This ensure subject suffer soft tissue injury , study group homogeneous ) Patients experienced bronchospasm , acute rhinitis , nasal polyp , angioneurotic oedema , urticaria , allergictype reaction take acetylsalicylic acid , NSAID 's , ( include COXIBS ) , antipyretics excipients . ( Rationale : This ensure subject history hypersensitivity drug give drug may cause allergic reaction ) Patients sulphonamide allergy . ( Rationale : This ensure subject history hypersensitivity certain drug give drug may cause allergic reaction ) Active peptic ulcer within previous six month ( Rationale : It well establish NSAID 's gastric irritation , gastritis , ulceration haemorrhage possible side effect . This ensure subject history syndrome include safety issue ) History recurrent peptic ( gastric duodenal ) ulcer ( Rationale : It well establish NSAID 's gastric irritation , gastritis , ulceration haemorrhage possible side effect . This ensure subject history syndrome include safety issue ) History bleed disorder , include gastrointestinal bleeding cerebrovascular bleeding ( Rationale : It well establish nonselective NSAID 's decrease clotting . This ensure subject history syndrome include safety issue ) Patients severe congestive heart failure ( NYHA 3 4 ) ( Rationale : The administration etoricoxib contraindicate patient ) Patients medical history ischemic heart disease cerebrovascular disease . ( Rationale : There potential risk cardiovascular event COX2 selective inhibitor use , although documented longterm use ( &gt; 18 month ) . History cardiac failure , leave ventricular dysfunction , hypertension preexist oedema . ( Rationale : Inhibition prostaglandin synthesis , cause drug , may cause fluid retention , oedema hypertension . Patients peripheral arterial disease ( Rationale : Peripheral aerial disease alter response heal ankle ligament ) Patients history current symptom clinical sign severe impairment renal function ( CrCl &lt; 30 ml/min ) moderate severe impairment hepatic function ( Rationale : The administration etoricoxib 120 mg contraindicate patient ) Patients inflammatory bowel disease . ( Rationale : The administration etoricoxib contraindicate patient ) . Patients consume three alcoholic drink per day , patient history alcohol abuse ( Rationale : Excessive alcohol intake could negatively affect liver function , interfere drug metabolism reduce compliance protocol ) Patients hereditary problem galactose intolerance , Lapp lactose deficiency glucosegalactose malabsorption . ( Rationale ; etoricoxib tablet contain lactose therefore contraindicated patient ) Currently pregnant lactate ( Rationale : The administration etoricoxib contraindicate patient ) Woman attempt conceive . ( Rationale : Any drug know inhibit COX2 contraindicate ) Concomitant treatment anticoagulant ( include heparin , warfarin , ticlopidine ) ( Rationale : It well establish NSAID 's decrease clotting . This ensure subject history establish bleed disorder anticlotting therapy include safety issue ) . Concomitant treatment lithium , methotrexate , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor , betablockers diuretic ) ( Rationale : NSAID 's significant drug interaction medication , potentiate impair effect others therefore patient medication exclude safety reason ) . Concomitant administration NSAID 's ( include aspirin dos &gt; 150 mg ) analgesic agent ( Rationale : The purpose study determine effect specific NSAID 's pain swelling . Concomitant use NSAID 's interfere outcome measure patient exclude study ) Concomitant administration cyclosporine tacrolimus . ( Rationale : Coadministration medication NSAID 's may increase nephrotoxic effect ) Concomitant treatment etoricoxib rifampicin . ( Rationale : Rifampicin potent inducer CYP enzymes produce 65 % decrease etoricoxib plasma concentration . ) Current treatment treatment within last two month corticosteroid ( systemic , intraarticular ) ( Rationale : Long act corticosteroid interfere outcome measure patient receive medication exclude study ) Participation another clinical trial study previous month ( Rationale : This ensure patient may still effect treatment administer another trial include ) Inability comply protocol ( Rationale : This exclude subject able complete study )</criteria>
