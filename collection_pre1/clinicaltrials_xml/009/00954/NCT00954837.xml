	<brief_summary>Thyroid nodule common ( prevalence 12.7 % woman ) , malignant 5 % case . International expert agree preliminary cytological examination fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) require . The management patient cytological result consistent malignant suspicious malignancy nodule well codify generally involve surgery . However , consensus concern 1 ) utility second FNA monitoring benign nodule . Certain study recommend second FNA , whereas others recommend ultrasound monitoring alone ; 2 ) contribution ultrasound criterion decision whether carry second FNA , particularly nodule increase size ; 3 ) management nodule classify doubtful suspect needle biopsy , many prove benign ( 20 30 % malignant ) , raise question utility systematic thyroid surgery justification second FNA ; 4 ) management patient non significant ( NS ) finding FNA , immediate surgery , monitor second FNA may recommend 5 ) procedure follow nodule present patient multinodular thyroid disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Repeat Fine Needle Aspiration ( FNA ) Detect Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : A study try evaluate value second needle biopsy . Ultrasound criterion malignancy describe mostly unvalidated . Only small number immunocytochemical study use several antibody report , mostly deal series le 50 case . The Bethesda State Science Conference hold October 2007 ( ahead print , 2009 ) fine-needle biopsy thyroid consider sufficiently robust study technique yet carry prospective study require . Objectives : The principal objective study determine utility second needle biopsy routine management patient present , give nodule , initial cytological result non-significant , benign , doubtful suspect . The secondary objective determine utility various pre-determined ultrasound criterion collection cell liquid medium combine immunocytochemistry . Methodology : Prospective study cohort 400 patient attend consultation Internal Medicine/Endocrinology Department ENT Department , refer external doctor , whether work hospital private practice , participate protocol single multiple thyroid nodule disease assessment . Each patient attend least one consultation undergo least one thyroid ultrasound scan fine-needle aspiration ( FNA ) . Based result first needle biopsy , management orient towards immediate surgery follow-up 6/12 18 month , second thyroid needle biopsy within maximum 18 month follow-up . Inclusion period : 18 month Duration follow-up : to18 month Total duration study : 36 month Description technique use protocol : Radiological technique : They undergo ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration ( FNA ) . Classical needle biopsy technique use , patient lie back neck hyperextension . An initial ultrasound scan use determine site site needle insert . Following extensive disinfection skin neck , needle insert ultrasound guidance . The needle move gently backwards forward displace radially clockwise direction recover cellular material capillarity . The material recover dilute 30 ml CYTOLYT ( Hologic ) , transport medium recuperation cell liquid medium . In general , several ( two three ) passages needle require give nodule . It possible carry FNA three nodule single session . For passage , new , sterile , single-use needle use . The insertion needle precede ultrasound scan . Surgical technique : For nodule surgery indicate , LOBOISTHMECTOMY carry frozen section ( FS ) . There three possibility : 1 ) FS provide evidence thyroid cancer . In case , total thyroidectomy carry , dissection lymph node area central ( zone VI ) lateral ( zone II IV ) zone side ; 2 ) FS provide evidence malignancy . In case , surgical intervention limit LOBOISTHMECTOMY ; 3 ) FS show nodule question suspect . In case , total thyroidectomy carry definitive pathological result know . It widely accept recurrent dissection also carry initial surgery . Indeed , definitive pathological examination show nodule cancerous , repeat surgical intervention recurrent dissection potentially much damaging recurrent nerve . If indication total thyroidectomy due presence multiple nodule multinodular goitre , FS carry entire thyroid , sample direct pathologist determine whether central lateral zone dissection carry . The sample circuit : All solid nodule 10 mm diameter biopsied FNA one nodule three nodule . Only large nodule nodule suspect characteristic ultrasound control FNA three nodule exceed 10 mm diameter . The procedure adopt depend individual nodule . Decisions concern surgery base severe diagnosis obtain several nodule assess . For nodule subject FNA , complete radiological description write , regardless time-point investigation carry ( T0 , T6 , T12 T18 ) . For patient see several occasion study , change one several nodule observe ultrasound scan note . The material collect FNA deposit liquid medium ( Hologic ; LBC technique ) . If several nodule examine , material nodule place separate , clearly identify flask . A complementary immunocytological study systematically carry nodule consider `` benign radiological modification . '' If sufficient residual cell material , panel antibody use , constitute available antibody follow : HBME1 , cytokeratin 19 , TTF1 , thyrocalcitonin , thyroglobulin , CD3 , CD20 . The result deliver two lot : first cytological morphological result alone , accord NCI Bethesda 2008 classification criterion , immunocytochemical result , broken three category ( probably benign , probably malignant inconclusive ) . Potential implication : The aim study intend clinical , radiological , cytological surgical feasible recommendation accurate follow-up benign single thyroid nodule multinodular goiter . Thyroid nodules essentially benign lesion ; therefore main objective detect cancer induce unnecessary surgical control .</detailed_description>
