	<brief_summary>The Canadian Severe Asthma Network ( CSAN ) develop gain good understand clinical , environmental , socio-economic , work-related , biological characteristic severe asthmatic ( SA ) may account poor response clinically available therapy asthma . This network clinical basic researcher mean Canadian investigator develop conduct research small patient group , could lead good clinical management SA . Patient information enter CSAN database ( create PI Dr. Vethanayagam connection Mr. Jack Yeung ) help researcher doctor multiple hospital university across Canada understand subpopulation asthmatic well . It help answer question regard SA epidemiology , asthma education , inflammatory monitoring , risk near fatal asthma ( NFA ) , symptom perception , change lung structure function , co-morbidities , effectiveness develop regional severe asthma clinic . Two early project investigator work psychosocial co-morbidities asthma medication coverage relate asthma . There also biobanking sputum sample and/or bronchoscopy sample ( BALs &amp; lung washing ) obtain clinical purpose . Also , consent biobanking blood urine collect , separate clinical care , store biobank . The Canadian Biosample Repository ( CBSR ) store biobanked sample . The investigator follow CBSR policy storage security . Tissue research conduct future , separate ethic approval obtain project .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>5-10 % adult asthmatic difficult control asthma severe asthma ( SA ) , require systemic steroid control disease ( `` steroid dependent asthmatic '' ) . Very little understood population ( Chanez , et al . JACI June 07 ) Networks study severe asthma emerge Europe ( ENFUMOSA ) United States ( US Severe Asthma Research Program ) understand small group patient account majority cost related asthma care ( &gt; 50 % ) . We would like establish network Canada well characterize asthmatic severe asthma ( mild-moderate asthmatic control ) . Sputum cell count assist somewhat improve asthma management population outside eosinophilic inflammation ( one subtype ) predict asthma control ( Lemiere C et al . J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006 ; 118:1033-9 ) . Little understood regard many patient frequent exacerbation rather chronic persistent asthma ( symptoms multiple time day ) particularly non-eosinophilic . SCCs useful within group detail analysis sputum ( particularly supernatant ) invasive testing require see population , good treat . Even less understood severe asthma childhood . We review patient ' biopsy clue well manage within clinical set note significant difference individual relation muscle mass , neuronal hypertrophy , inflammation ( often absent severe asthma ) . Bronchoscopies do routinely SA patient assess airway well obtain bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) specimens sometimes transbronchial biopsy . Our hypothesis and/ research question : Immediate : 1 . Natural History : 1 . What natural history SA ? 2 . What proportion patient SA MMA prior NFA episode ? ( retrospective ) 3 . Do death due asthma occur commonly Canadians SA , oppose MMA ? ( prospective ) 2 . NFA SA : 1 . What regional prevalence NFA episodes individual SA manage within Canadian Health Care System ? 2 . What natural history patient SA experience episode NFA ? 3 . Does management SA within SA Centres Excellence ( SA Centres ) alter risk subsequent episodes NFA ? 4 . What gene relate NFA individual SA MMA ? 3 . What burden co-morbidities individual SA oppose individual MMA ? 4 . What burden steroid-related complication patient SA ? 5 . Immunology : 1 . What regional prevalence atopy SA ? 2 . What regional prevalence non-TH2 mediate immunologic deviance SA ? Future Projects CSAN registry establish ( specific grant funding request ) 6 . Education : 1 . What unique educational need patient SA need resolve ? 2 . Can use translatable SA action plan SA Centre ? 7 . Inflammatory monitoring : 1 . What barriers implement use sputum cell count ( SCCs ) routinely within SA Centres Canada cost-benefit perspective ? 2 . What barriers establish standard protocol SCC monitoring ( frequency every 3 month ) SA Centres ? 3 . Is role Exhaled Nitric Oxide ( ENO ) measurement SCC monitoring SA Centres individual SA ? 8 . Symptom perception : 1 . How perception dyspnea vary patient NFA SA ? 2 . Are simple way identify patient poor perception dyspnea high risk population ? 9 . Pathophysiology : 1 . What factor promote fix airflow obstruction population ? 2 . What feature lead persistent airway neutrophilia population ? 3 . Do SA develop airway remodelling MMA present , airway remodelling progress faster rate SA group ? 10 . Health Service Delivery : 1 . Are differences organizational clinic structure SA Centres improve efficiency management ? 2 . Can develop specialized new SA Centres Canada effectively ( knowledge transfer organization ) ? 3 . Is cost effective develop regional SA Centres Canada ?</detailed_description>
