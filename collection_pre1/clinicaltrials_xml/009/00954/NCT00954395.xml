	<detailed_description>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE- deposition thrombus deep vein low limbs-deep vein thrombosis- and/or pulmonary embolism ) incidence 1.0 - 1.6 event per year per 1000 person . While prevention treatment acute phase VTE well establish , secondary prevention disease , long-term management , well standardize . Venous thromboembolism tend recur regardless duration treatment , incidence 30 % 5-10 year . Both duration quality treatment acute event well establish consistently apply clinical practice . Recently , 7th Consensus Conference Anti-thrombotic therapy American College Chest Physicians recommend patient unprovoked VTE receive least 3 month anticoagulant therapy . Afterwards risk-benefit ratio long-term therapy evaluate . Long term treatment recommend patient low risk bleed good anticoagulant monitoring achievable . However , risk recurrence great first 6 12 month initial episode gradually decrease thereafter . As result , benefit extend anticoagulation offset time risk clinically important bleeding associate anticoagulation . Moreover , vitamin K antagonist ( VKAs ) currently drug choice , require strict laboratory monitoring , near future new oral anticoagulant require monitoring available . Several individual characteristic post-anticoagulation D-dimer residual venous obstruction show associate increase risk recurrent event . We show multicentre randomize study PROLONG ( N Engl J Med 2006 ; 355 : 1780-1789 ) show D-dimer could play role establish duration anticoagulation first episode idiopathic VTE . Patients treat VKA minimum 3 month D-d test one month anticoagulation withdrawal . If D-dimer normal patient resume treatment , whereas elevate D-dimer randomize either stop resume anticoagulation . Patients abnormal D-dimer statistically significant high risk recurrence compare normal D-d . Continued anticoagulation patient elevate D-d significantly reduce risk recurrent VTE follow-up 18 month . The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety procedure employ evaluation residual vein obstruction D-dimer establish individual risk recurrence thus necessity prolong stop anticoagulation ( VKAs also newer anticoagulant ) venous thromboembolism . The pre-defined objective study follow : ) obtain recurrence rate &lt; 5 % per year first second year anticoagulation suspend accord procedure ii ) allow treatment first episode venous thromboembolism , anticoagulation suspension feasible least 40 % subject include study .</detailed_description>
