	<detailed_description>During Phase I ( non-randomized phase ) study , primary objective ass rate target lesion failure subject implant CYPHER® stent receive dual antiplatelet therapy 12 month . During Phase II ( randomized phase ) study , primary objective ass safety ( major minor bleed ) , MACCE , ST rate subject treat dual antiplatelet therapy 12 30 month follow CYPHER® stent implantation . *Subjects treat CYPHER® 2.25mm stent follow 60 month . **The last 500 patient enrol eligible randomization .</detailed_description>
