	<brief_summary>Purpose : To compare efficacy oral gabapentin new analogue pregabalin postoperative pain control photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK ) . Methods : One hundred four patient meet inclusion criterion undergo PRK one eye randomize one two treatment group . Those group A treat gabapentin , group B treat pregabalin control postoperative PRK pain . Patients group begin treatment two hour prior surgery order achieve therapeutic blood level medication . After surgery patient assess pain level use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) different interval time - one hour surgery , even surgery , three time day three subsequent day . Patients also daily assess level somnolence use Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) record presence dizziness amount time . On fourth day return clinic postoperative appointment . At time pain , sleepiness , dizziness assessment scale collect analyzed . The patient return one month later assess long-term pain heal PRK . Results : Both gabapentin pregabalin show previous study treat postoperative pain effectively . The effect gabapentin 300 mg TID 3 day versus pregabalin 50 mg TID 3 day decrease overall postoperative pain follow PRK present . Conclusion : The effectiveness two different treatment medication analyze , conclusion base result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>METHODS : One hundred four patient meet inclusion criterion undergo photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK ) one eye randomly assign one two treatment group via computer . Those group A treat gabapentin group B treat pregabalin control postoperative PRK pain . Patients group begin treatment two hour prior surgery . Patients gabapentin group take 300 mg three time day start two hour prior surgery continue total four day . Patients pregabalin group take 50 mg three time day start two hour prior surgery also continue four day . Only refractive surgery coordinator patient know medication patient take . The patient instruct share information study participant surgeon . The coordinator keep list patient ID number treatment receive . Prior surgery , patient taught ass pain level use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , well document method pain assessment . After surgery patient assess pain level different interval time - one hour surgery , even surgery , three time day four subsequent day . Patients also daily assess level somnolence use Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) record presence dizziness daily amount time . On fourth day return clinic post operative appointment . At time pain assessment scale collect analyzed . The patient return one month ass long term pain PRK . Statistical Analysis : Postoperative pain level record use visual analogue scale , ESS , self report dizziness assessment collect fourth postoperative day . These compile data set analyze . Data compile mean low upper quartile analyze use two-sided test . The difference pain level describe throughout postoperative period determine one medication significantly reduce postoperative pain initially within first 24 hour , interval 24 hour four day , surgery ( one month postoperatively ) . Data regarding level somnolence dizziness also report .</detailed_description>
