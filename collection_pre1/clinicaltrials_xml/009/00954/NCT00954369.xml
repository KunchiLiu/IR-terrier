	<brief_summary>PHASE : Phase 0 , Exploratory Study OBJECTIVES : To collect drug safety , bio-distribution dosimetry data , begin collection PET/CT imaging data , acquire experience improve study design conduct future study . DESIGN : Exploratory , open label , non-randomized , multi-center study . DURATION : Three visit - one screening , one imaging , one follow-up visit 24 hour post-dose PROCEDURES : Informed consent , collection demographic information medical history , administration mental status exam , physical examination , vital sign , 12-lead ECGs , routine blood test assess major organ function , complete blood count clinical chemistry safety , dose [ F-18 ] W372 , PET image scan brain ( sixteen subject ) , whole body PET image urine collection dosimetry evaluation ( four subject ) , observation interview follow image collect adverse event . SUBJECTS : Twenty ( 20 ) subject ≥ 55 year old : Group 1 consist 10 subject low probability currently positive Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) define protocol criterion ( MMSE ≥ 28 ) . Four 10 subject undergo whole body PET image dosimetry evaluation , 6 10 subject undergo PET image brain . Group 2 consist 10 subject high probability currently positive AD define protocol criterion ( MMSE &lt; 24 ) ; 10 subject undergo PET image brain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Safety Study F-18W372</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>[ F-18 ] W372 develop diagnostic radiopharmaceutical PET image human brain . SMI seek determine [ F-18 ] W372 might useful noninvasive assessment tool aid clinical evaluation subject condition associate increased amyloid-β deposit , Alzheimer 's disease . Compared non-invasive imaging approach , value amyloid PET image sensitive accurate previously establish measure FDG PET volumetric MRI diagnostic classification subject , suggest amyloid PET ligand may useful differentiate among Alzheimer 's disease , mild cognitive impairment , normal age well neurodegenerative disease . Therefore , novel kind molecular marker may provide advantage measure amyloid plaque vivo , potential revolutionize early diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease , hopefully facilitate AD diagnosis improve accuracy . In exploratory study , novel PET ligand image amyloid plaque evaluate age-matched normal low probability AD subject high probability AD order determine bio-distribution , visualize signal/background brain , ultimately evaluate safety feasibility [ F-18 ] W372 potential PET biomarker image amyloid human brain . The IP present know risk either vitro study cell line vivo study animal accord preclinical investigation compound . The population study consist total approximately twenty adult subject , two group assignment . Group one consist ten subject low probability currently positive Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) define protocol criterion . Four ten subject Group one undergo evaluation dosimetry . Group two consist ten subject high probability currently positive AD define protocol criterion . In first year , exploratory trial conduct Phase 0 study design evaluate bio-distribution data , collect baseline imaging data , gather preliminary safety data investigational product . Based analyzed study result , information consider design future clinical trial . The primary objective exploratory study : - To collect drug safety information , bio-distribution data , radiation dosimetry estimation - To evaluate drug uptake signal/background information brain PET image subject high probability currently positive AD age-matched subject low probability currently positive AD - To use exploratory Investigational New Drug ( eIND ) document order obtain necessary information file IND ( Investigational New Drug ) application FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) The secondary objective exploratory study : • To begin collection baseline PET image data gain information improve study design conduct future trials The trial expect begin subject enrollment approximately August 2009 end subject participation approximately December 2009 , depend rate enrollment . The subject expect attend several visit , add several hour ( 10 hour ) participation three visit : screen visit ( Visit 1 - 2 hour ) , PET/CT image visit ( Visit 2 - 3-4 hour ) , follow visit ( Visit 3 - 1 hour ) 24 hour receive investigational product . The investigational product administer qualified subject via bolus injection ( approximately 10 mCi administered subject , except 20 mCi four subject low probability positive AD involve dosimetry analysis ) . This dose exceed 20 mCi , image time extend approximately three hour . A large dose ( 20 mCi ) need order obtain quality image later time point . Each study subject study subject undergo three ( 3 ) visit . Visit 1 initial screen visit obtain informed consent determine prospective subject meet inclusion / exclusion criterion eligibility blood lab draw assess mental status perform Mini-Mental Status Exam ( MMSE ) . Concomitant medication adverse event record time inform consent Visit 3 . Visit 2 image visit physical exam perform , vital sign measure , ECG test do , pre-dose blood lab draw safety . The subject receive one dose investigational product undergoes PET image . The subject undergo additional vital sign measurement ECG test dose Visit 2 . Visit 3 do repeat draw blood lab safety , measure vital sign , ECG test do . All three visit must complete order complete participation study .</detailed_description>
