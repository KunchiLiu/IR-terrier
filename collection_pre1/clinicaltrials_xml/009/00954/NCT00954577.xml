	<brief_summary>This study examine risk factor type 2 diabetes child represent multiple discrete ethnic group . It also examine short term effect school-based health education supervise exercise metabolic risk factor type 2 diabetes mellitus child . The investigator hypothesize exercise health education significantly improve insulin sensitivity child , especially child already insulin resistant , thereby lower risk go develop type 2 diabetes mellitus . The specific hypothesis test : 1 . Insulin resistance evident overweight child impaired ability pancreas release insulin evident child family history type 2 diabetes mellitus . 2 . Exercise significantly improve insulin resistance ( measure fast glucose/insulin ratio ) little effect insulin secretory capacity child . 3 . Participation school-based health , nutrition , exercise education program long term beneficial effect health relate behavior insulin resistance child , regardless level diabetes risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prevalence type 2 diabetes mellitus ( type 2 DM ) among adolescent increase &gt; 10 fold past decade . Type 2 DM reflect interaction genes/traits convey increase risk impaired function pancreatic cell secrete insulin ( islet cell ) muscle/liver insulin sensitivity environmental factor reduce level activity increase adiposity . Both impaired islet cell function insulin resistance independently associate increase risk subsequent diabetes mellitus may consider 'prediabetic ' phenotype . This study examine prevalence prediabetic phenotype effect supervise exercise/nutrition education risk factor type 2 DM 6th-8th grade student undergo 5 minute intravenous glucose tolerance test , well measurement diabetes risk factor include family history , body composition , circulate concentration molecule ( cytokine ) marker inflammation , lipid profile , participate intervention . These study also use calculate ability pancreas secrete insulin sensitivity student insulin . No previous study isolate effect exercise nutrition education different diabetes subphenotypes child . To insure necessary ethnic diversity necessary study , data pool multisite study Mt . Sinai , North Shore/LIJ , Maimonides , Winthrop Hospitals . We remain contact student track subsequent development diabetes intervention effect lifestyle . We hypothesize diabetes risk student reduce exercise education healthy lifestyle type health benefit ( i.e. , improve body fatness , improve insulin sensitivity , improve insulin secretion , improve cholesterol , decrease inflammation ) different ethnic group . The result study , believe , demonstrate benefit health physical education program student , regardless diabetes risk , also enable u good understand diabetes develop child expectation health improvement different ethnic group intervention .</detailed_description>
