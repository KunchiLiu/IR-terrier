	<detailed_description>Smoking cause &gt; 400,000 death cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) per year . The molecular basis smoking induce tissue injury remain unclear considerable evidence support role oxidant stress ( OS ) . Arterial function show impaired smoker even onset angiographically demonstrable atherosclerosis . Defects endothelium dependant flow mediate vasodilatation ( FMD ) see risk overt vascular disease . Cigarette smoke highly addictive . Spontaneous quit rate approximate 3 % . Even use nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) high relapse rate ( 67-75 % ) completion 8-12 week course NRT . Thus interest use extend NRT `` safer '' alternative cigarette smoking . However assumption may premature . Nicotine demonstrate proxidant effect vitro small study associate endothelial dysfunction . Studies simultaneously assess effect nicotine oxidative stress arterial function human perform . The current proposal address hypothesis nicotine , like cigarette smoke act pro-oxidant may adverse effect arterial function .</detailed_description>
