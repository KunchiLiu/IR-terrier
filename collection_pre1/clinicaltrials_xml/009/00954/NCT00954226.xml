	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn effect standard dose erlotinib high dose erlotinib biomarker level patient head neck cancer . Biomarkers chemical `` marker '' blood and/or tissue may relate response study drug . The safety drug also study . Objectives : To determine molecular effect safety erlotinib 150 mg/day ( standard dose ) 200 mg/day 300 mg/day ( high-dose ) patient head neck cancer plan surgery . Primary Objective : To determine effect erlotinib 150 mg/day ( standard dose ) 200 mg/day 300 mg/day ( high-dose ) phosphorylation AKT protein downstream EGFR . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To assess safety tolerability erlotinib 150 mg/day ( standard dose ) 200 mg/day 300 mg/day ( high-dose ) . 2 . To correlate effect erlotinib phosphorylation AKT immunohistochemical expression level EGFR level amplification EGFR gene determine fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) . 3 . To evaluate preliminary response rate short course erlotinib . 4 . To evaluate change activation status protein downstream EGFR receptor tyrosine kinases marker epithelial mesenchymal transition . 5 . To evaluate change blood-based biomarkers . 6 . To evaluate effect high dose erlotinib ( 300 mg/day ) current smoker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Erlotinib design block activity protein find surface many tumor cell may control tumor growth survival . This may stop tumor grow . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) receive erlotinib either standard dose high dose . There equal chance assign either group . If assign high dose group current smoker , receive even high daily dose erlotinib . Both study doctor know group . Study Drug Administration : Group 1 take 1 tablet erlotinib day , every day lead surgery . Group 2 take 2 tablet day , every day lead surgery . Depending assign dose level , 2 tablet may contain drug amount 2 different drug amount . Erlotinib take time day , 1 hour 2 hour meal . Each dose take 8 ounce water . You consume grapefruit grapefruit juice study . If vomit take medication , take another dose , vomited tablet ( ) see count ( word , digest yet ) . Study Visits : Every 2 week , study visit . The following test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ask side effect may experience . - You CT scan MRI check status disease within 1 week surgery . Within one week surgery , also blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw check blood clot function . Length Study : You study least 2-3 week day surgery . You may study 8 week delay surgery . After complete study , surgery remove tumor . During surgery , sample tumor tissue already remove collect check biomarkers . Follow-up : Within 30 day surgery , contact phone ask side effect experience . The phone call last 10 minute . This investigational study . Erlotinib FDA approve commercially available treatment non-small cell lung cancer pancreatic cancer ( first-line therapy combination gemcitabine ) . Its use study investigational . Up 55 patient enrol study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients histologically confirm cancer head neck . Patients salivary gland tumor squamous cell carcinoma skin also eligible . ( Note : Any patient diagnosis aggressive squamous cell carcinoma skin determine surgically resectable consider eligibility . These patient typically see Head &amp; Neck surgery clinic decision study consideration base consultation department Head &amp; Neck surgery . ) 2 . The patient must biopsyaccessible disease . 3 . Patients must surgical candidate ( either definitive palliative setting ) . 4 . Patients may receive prior therapy include cytotoxic chemotherapy ( e.g . platinum drug taxanes ) radiation therapy . 5 . Patients must performance score ( ECOG ) 02 . 6 . Patients adequate bone marrow function , define peripheral granulocyte count &gt; /= 1,000/mm³ , platelet count &gt; /= 50,000/mm³.Patients must adequate liver function bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) must &lt; /= 2 x ULN alkaline phosphatase must &lt; /= 2 x ULN . 7 . Patients adequate renal function ( serum creatinine &lt; /= 1.5 x ULN ) . 8 . Age &gt; /= 18 year 9 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document indicate aware investigational nature study , keep institutional policy 10 . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Childbearing potential defined woman menses within past 12 month , tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately.The patient , man , agree use effective contraception abstinence . 1 . Patients prior exposure small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor EGFRtargeted antibody within past 6 month . 2 . Patients , opinion treat surgeon , administration erlotinib would cause deleterious delay surgical treatment . 3 . Patients uncompensated congestive cardiac failure . 4 . Patients organ allograft . 5 . Patients serious concurrent infection illness include , limited , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness could limit compliance study requirement . 6 . Female patient pregnant breastfeed 7 . Patients currently chemotherapy , immunotherapy , therapy monoclonal antibody investigational agent antitumor activity</criteria>
