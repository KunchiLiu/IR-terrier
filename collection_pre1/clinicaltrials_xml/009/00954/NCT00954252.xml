	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) CHF5074 single oral administration young healthy male volunteer . The secondary objective study evaluate pharmacokinetics CHF5074 single oral administration young healthy male volunteer . The secondary endpoint study verify CHF5074 plasma level ( Cmax AUC0-t ) increase proportionally dose ( dose-linearity ) . The exploratory objective study evaluate pharmacodynamics CHF5074 single oral administration young healthy male volunteer . The respective exploratory endpoint ass relationship individual maximum CHF5074 plasma concentration correspond A-beta42 plasma concentration correct baseline A-beta42 level .</detailed_description>
