	<brief_summary>Objective : The aim examine feasibility acceptability handheld biofeedback device adjunct treatment Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) estimate clinical effect size . A recent summary 22 study OIF/OEF ( Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom ) veteran reveal many individual system factor ( e.g. , stigma , concern promotion/employment , lack provider ) prevent access mental health service . For veteran seek help , large treatment trial pharmacologic , outpatient psychotherapy , residential treatment program effective . Currently , prolong exposure therapy validate PTSD treatment . The VHA enrollees OIF/OEF likely live rural area , hinder pursue treatment due travel distance time commitment . Thus , new treatment delivery method urgently need . A substantial body preclinical literature document autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) dysregulation patient PTSD . Preliminary result suggest portable heart rate variability ( HRV ) /respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( RSA ) biofeedback promise adjunct treatment autonomic arousal disorder . The StressEraser , HRV/RSA biofeedback device , indicated relaxation , relaxation training , stress reduction . This small handheld device measure display real-time RSA via infrared finger sensor . Research Plan : The investigator able randomize 16 OIF/OEF veteran receive care PTSD CAVHS community-based outpatient clinic ( CBOCs ) 24-week course StressEraser use ( N=8 ) versus usual care ( N=8 ) . A trouble-shooting phone call participant occur 6 week . Follow-up clinical assessment occur 12 24 week . Methods : The baseline assessment consist screen interview comorbid anxiety substance use disorder , Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) , 9-item depression Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) , quality life measure ( Quality Well-Being Scale-Self Administered [ QWB-SA ] ) . In addition , psychophysiologic assessment reactivity attentional bias combat-related PTSD relevant stimulus occur virtual reality ( VR ) acoustic startle stimuli North Little Rock psychophysiologic reactivity lab . The StressEraser group train operate device baseline instruct use 5-20 minute daily bedtime 24 week . At six week , research assistant phone StressEraser group address problem device usual care group insure adherence ongoing treatment . The 12-week assessment involve phone group administer psychometric measure ( CAPS , PHQ-9 , QWB-SA ) . At 24 week , sample return lab administration psychometric measure assessment psychophysiologic reactivity . The subject StressEraser group return device . The time spend use StressEraser total number resonant frequency respiration feasibility measure . The StressEraser log date , time , duration use amount resonant frequency breathing , resonance respiratory baroreflex rhythm , two primary source cardiac stimulation . Acceptability measure short debrief interview .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjunctive Biofeedback Intervention Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom ( OIF-OEF ) Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim proposal examine feasibility acceptability use handheld biofeedback intervention adjunct treatment Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) estimate effect size biofeedback intervention adjunct treatment PTSD . A recent RAND Corporation Report summarize 22 study OIF/OEF ( Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom ) veteran , give typical range 5-15 % veteran meet diagnostic criterion PTSD , study report rate high 30 % . Of active duty service member meet criterion mental health referral base post-deployment health assessment , half ( 41.8-61.0 % ) receive mental health service . Many individual system factor ( e.g. , stigma , concern promotion/employment , wait time , lack provider ) prevent access . Historically , veterans access treatment combat-related PTSD , large treatment trial pharmacologic , outpatient psychotherapy , residential treatment program show treatment effective . More recently , Institute Medicine recommend prolonged exposure therapy validate PTSD treatment . However , rural OIF/OEF veteran hinder travel distance time commitment necessary receive recommend treatment . The VA Office Rural Health report VHA enrollee OIF/OEF likely live rural area . Thus , new treatment new treatment delivery method urgently need . A substantial historic grow preclinical literature document autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) dysregulation patient PTSD . Preliminary result suggest portable heart rate variability ( HRV ) / respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( RSA ) biofeedback appear promising adjunct treatment disorder autonomic arousal . The StressEraser , HRV/RSA biofeedback device , indicated relaxation , relaxation training , stress reduction . The StressEraser small handheld device measure display real-time RSA , measure HRV , via infrared finger sensor . We randomize 30 OIF/OEF veteran receive care PTSD CAVHS community-based outpatient clinic ( CBOC 's ) 24-week course StressEraser use ( N=15 ) versus usual care ( N=15 ) . The baseline assessment consist screen interview comorbid anxiety substance use disorder , Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) , 9-item depression Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) determine symptom depression , quality life measure ( Quality Well-Being Scale-Self Administered [ QWB-SA ] ) . In addition , subject participate assessment psychophysiologic measure response virtual reality ( VR ) acoustic startle stimuli attentional bias measure combat-related PTSD relevant stimulus . Subjects StressEraser group train use demonstrate proficiency use device completion baseline assessment . These subject instruct use StressEraser 5-20 minute daily bedtime 24 week . Follow-up assessment occur 12 24 week baseline StressEraser usual care subject . Subjects contact phone 6 week address problem use StressEraser ( intervention group ) insure adherence ongoing treatment usual care group . The 12-week assessment occur phone address current symptom severity PTSD ( CAPS ) depression ( PHQ-9 ) health-related quality life QWB-SA . The 24-week assessment in-person psychophysiologic reactivity lab North Little Rock repeat assessment psychophysiologic measure VR acoustic startle stimuli attentional bias measure combat-related PTSD relevant stimulus include psychometric measure . The subject ask bring StressEraser him/her 24-week assessment document duration frequency use . Feasibility measure amount time subject spend use StressEraser . The StressEraser log date , time , duration use . It also log amount resonant frequency breathe achieve , resonance respiratory baroreflex rhythm , two primary source cardiac stimulation . This information easily download StressEraser device . The feasibility measure total duration use total number resonant frequency respiration . Acceptability measure use short debrief interview 12 week longer debrief interview 24 week . Additional measure include change CAPS , PHQ-9 , QWB-SA score measure baseline , 12 , 24 week change psychophysiologic reactivity 24 week compare baseline .</detailed_description>
