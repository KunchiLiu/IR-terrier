	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study assess pharmacodynamic effect single , oral dos SRT2104 ( 250 mg , 500 mg , 1000 mg , 2000 mg ) prednisolone measure level ex vivo LPS-induced TNF-alpha production whole blood healthy adult subject . The secondary purpose study assess pharmacodynamic effect single , oral dos SRT2104 ( 250 mg , 500 mg , 1000 mg , 2000 mg ) prednisolone ( 30mg ) measure level IL-6 , IL-8 IL-1beta whole blood healthy adult subject . In addition , plasma pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability SRT2104 follow administration single , oral dos SRT2104 ( 250 mg , 500 mg , 1000 mg , 2000 mg ) healthy adult subject also assess . As exploratory endpoint , transcriptomic profile , biomarker exploration , relationship plasma SRT2104 level ex vivo LPS-induced TNF-alpha production may also examine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , single center , non-therapeutic clinical study SRT2104 administer orally 250 mg capsule . Randomized , double-blind study evaluate compare sensitivity systemic biomarkers , ex-vivo LPS-induced TNF-alpha , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-1beta , treatment four-single oral dos SRT2104 ( 250 mg , 500 mg , 1000 mg , 2000 mg ) , prednisolone ( 30 mg ) , placebo healthy adult volunteer . Twenty ( 20 ) subject ( male females non-childbearing potential ) age 18-60 , fulfill inclusion/exclusion criterion , enrol study achieve minimum 15 evaluable subject . Each subject participate 6 treatment period . For treatment period subject fast least 10 hour overnight . After pre-dosing procedure , subject consume standard , non-high-fat ( approximately 650 kcal approximately 30 % calorie derive fat ) meal 15-30 minute prior receive test material . During first five treatment period , subject receive single dose SRT2104 match placebo ; last treatment period , subject receive 30 mg open-label prednisolone . Assessments perform 24 hour post dose treatment period . Subjects ask sign inform consent form ( ) screen visit . If eligible willing participate , subject enter study . Subjects require attend research unit fast state ( least 10 hour without food ) six separate occasion ( treatment visit ) study . There least 7-day washout period treatment visit . During first five treatment visit , subject receive one follow five treatment : A . 250 mg SRT2104 administer eight oral capsule ( one active SRT2104 250 mg capsule + seven placebo capsule ) B . 500 mg SRT2104 administer eight oral capsule ( two active SRT2104 250 mg capsule + six placebo capsule ) C. 1000 mg SRT2104 administer eight oral capsule ( four active SRT2104 250 mg capsule + four placebo capsule ) D. 2000 mg SRT2104 administer eight oral capsule ( eight active SRT2104 250 mg capsule + zero placebo capsule ) E. Eight placebo capsule During last treatment visit , subject receive 30 mg open-label prednisolone tablet . Subjects require return research unit 24 hour dose treatment period order gather require PK PD sample . Subjects ask return study center End Study safety assessment 7 10 day last treatment visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The study open healthy male female volunteer , 18 60 year age , hematology , clinical chemistry , electrolytes , serology , urinalysis test within normal , allowable limit use normal laboratory value ( outofrange value result , must consider clinically significant Investigator exclusionary ) perform within 21 day 1 day receive first dose test material . All male subject female partner must willing able use acceptable form doublebarrier birth control ( hormonal double barrier method birth control [ condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam , gel , film , cream , suppository ] ; true abstinence ) least 12 week last treatment dose . All female subject must nonchildbearing potential . For purpose study , nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] . [ Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use adequate contraception ( hormonal double barrier method birth control [ condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam , gel , film , cream , suppository ] ; true abstinence ) duration study dose least 12 week last treatment dose , wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method ] .</criteria>
