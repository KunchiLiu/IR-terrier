	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving drug different combination may kill cancer cell . It yet know treatment regimen effective treat Hodgkin lymphoma . PURPOSE : This phase III trial study three different therapy regimen compare well work treat patient previously untreated Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Three Different Therapy Regimens Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate event-free survival . Secondary - Evaluate overall survival . - Evaluate prognostic value FDG-PET scanning . - Evaluate progression-free survival . - Evaluate tolerability . - Evaluate rate relapse . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients assign 1 3 treatment group accord prognosis . - Group 1 ( favorable prognosis ) : Patients receive ABVD chemotherapy comprise doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , bleomycin sulfate IV , vincristine sulfate IV , dacarbazine IV , methylprednisolone IV day 1 14 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course . Patients undergo PET scan evaluation response . Patients receive additional treatment accord response . - Favorable response : Patients favorable response receive 1 additional course ABVD chemotherapy . - Unfavorable response : Patients unfavorable response receive 1 course VABEM chemotherapy comprise vindesine IV continuously day 1-5 , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously day 1-3 , carmustine IV day 3 , etoposide IV day 3-5 , methylprednisolone IV day 1-5 . - Group 2 ( intermediate prognosis ) : Patients receive 2 course ABVD chemotherapy . Patients undergo PET scan evaluation response . Patients receive additional treatment accord response . - Favorable response : Patients favorable response receive 4 additional course ABVD chemotherapy . - Unfavorable response : Patients unfavorable response receive VABEM chemotherapy . Treatment VABEM chemotherapy repeat every 28 day 2 course . - Group 3 ( poor prognosis ) : Patients receive 2 course VABEM chemotherapy . Patients undergo PET scan evaluation response . Patients receive additional treatment accord response . - Favorable response : Patients favorable response receive 1 additional course VABEM chemotherapy . - Unfavorable response : Patients unfavorable response receive CEO chemotherapy comprise cisplatin IV continuously day 1-3 , gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 1 8 , oral dexamethasone daily day 1-4 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course . Patients undergo PET scan . Patients receive additional treatment accord response . - Favorable response : Patients favorable response receive BEAM chemotherapy comprise carmustine IV day -7 , etoposide IV cytarabine IV day -6 -3 , melphalan IV day -2 . Patients undergo autologous stem cell transplantation day 0 . - Unfavorable response : Patients unfavorable response receive MINE chemotherapy comprise mitoguazone IV , vinorelbine ditartrate IV , ifosfamide IV day 1-5 etoposide IV day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course . Patients undergo allogeneic autologous stem cell transplantation . Patients favorable response `` bulky '' mass diagnosis may also undergo radiotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 15 year .</detailed_description>
