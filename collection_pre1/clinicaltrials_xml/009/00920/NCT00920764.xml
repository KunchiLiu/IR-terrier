	<brief_summary>The study objective investigate effect three low dos atrasentan urinary albumin/creatinine ratio ( UACR ) level subject Type 2 diabetic nephropathy . Patients Type 2 diabetes nephropathy must receive renin-angiotensin system inhibitor , Angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEi ) Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker ( ARB ) participation study . ACEi ARB treatment standard care management proteinuria Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) patient .</brief_summary>
