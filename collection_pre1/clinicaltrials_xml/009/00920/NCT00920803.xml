	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine safety tolerability SRT501 ( 5.0 g ) subject colorectal cancer hepatic metastasis administer daily 14 day . The purpose also characterize pharmacokinetic profile SRT501 ( 5.0 g ) assessing level SRT501 metabolites blood , urine , bile normal malignant metastatic tissue subject colorectal cancer hepatic metastasis administer daily 14 day . The secondary purpose examine pharmacodynamics SRT501 activity normal malignant tissue sample , include blood and/or bodily fluid .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Assess Safety , Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics SRT501 Subjects With Colorectal Cancer Hepatic Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , inpatient/outpatient study ass safety , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics SRT501 subject diagnose colorectal cancer hepatic metastasis . Fifteen subject age 18 year age old fulfill inclusion/exclusion criterion , enrol study . Ten subject , eligible , randomized receive SRT501 5 subject , eligible , randomized receive placebo . Subjects sign informed consent form prior study-related procedure . If eligible , subject consent receive 5.0 g SRT501 placebo , administer daily oral reconstitute powder , 14 day time day . On Days 1 2 , SRT501 placebo administer approximately 15-30 minute follow consumption standardize breakfast allow PK sample collection . On day , SRT501 placebo administer approximately 15-30 minute follow consumption even meal . Following course SRT501 placebo administration , subject undergo scheduled surgical removal metastatic liver disease well non-diseased tissue sample evaluate SRT501 concentration pharmacodynamic marker neoplastic activity ( cell differentiation , apoptosis , proliferation , etc. ) . Due schedule surgical availability , subject receive SRT501 placebo minimum 10 day maximum 21 day . If diseased colon tissue also schedule remove resection , diseased normal colon tissue also collect analysis . Participants require return study center Day 2 24-hour PK sample even prior schedule surgical resection well per Institution 's standard care recovery follow surgical procedure .</detailed_description>
