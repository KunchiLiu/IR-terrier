	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine safety tolerability SRT501 ( 5.0 g ) without concurrent bortezomib administration , administer daily 21 day cycle , male female subject Multiple Myeloma . The purpose also define objective response ( ORR , CR , PR , MR , SD ) time progression ( TTP ) SRT501 without concurrent bortezomib administer concurrently male female subject Multiple Myeloma . In addition , 15 subject participate sub-study ass pharmacokinetics SRT501 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Assess Safety Activity SRT501 Alone Combination With Bortezomib Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This , open-label , phase II study SRT501 , alone combination bortezomib , subject measurable Multiple Myeloma . Sixty-one ( 61 ) evaluable subject , fulfill inclusion/exclusion criterion , enrol study . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample collect subset 15 subject determine SRT501 plasma concentration patient population . Subjects sign informed consent form prior study related procedure . If eligible , subject receive 5.0 g SRT501 administer 20 consecutive day 21 day cycle maximum 12 cycle . SRT501 administer oral suspension product time morning ( approximately 15-30 minute follow consumption breakfast ) dosing day . Safety assessment perform continuously throughout cycle review subject Day 21 cycle prior subject proceed next cycle . SRT501 administer Day 21 cycle . Subjects assess efficacy response SRT501 end every 2 cycle ( 6 week ) treatment . When necessary , bone marrow biopsy CT ( appropriate radiographic imaging ) chest abdomen/pelvis perform confirm response . After first two cycle SRT501 treatment review efficacy response analysis , subject exhibit stable disease well SRT501 monotherapy may continue SRT501 monotherapy ( 5.0 g/day ) additional two cycle . If , first two cycle SRT501 monotherapy , subject exhibit PD , subject receive bortezomib ( 1.3 mg/ m2 Day 1 , Day 4 , Day 8 , Day 11 21 day cycle ) conjunction SRT501 ( 5.0 g/day ) . Bortezomib administer prior SRT501 administration . If two additional cycle SRT501 monotherapy ( 4 cycle total ) , subject exhibit MR well , remain SRT501 ( 5.0 g/day ) treatment judge SD PD . At time subject judge SD PD receive least four cycle SRT501 ( 5.0 g/day ) monotherapy , may also receive bortezomib ( 1.3 mg/m2 Day 1 , Day 4 , Day 8 , Day 11 21 day cycle ) conjunction daily SRT501 dosing . If point subject receive SRT501 bortezomib subject assess PD , remove study require undergo End Study assessments/follow-up approximately 28 day ( +/- 7 day ) follow last dose SRT501 SRT501 bortezomib .</detailed_description>
